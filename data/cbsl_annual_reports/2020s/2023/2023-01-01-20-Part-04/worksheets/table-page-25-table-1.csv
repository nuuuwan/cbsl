"conDiTions for consenT of The DaTa subjecT"
"(a)   the controller shall demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of the personal data relating to such"
"data subject;"
"(b)   if the consent of the data subject is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the"
"request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible"
"and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language:"
"Provided that, such a declaration shall not constitute an infringement of any provisions of this Act."
"(c)   when assessing whether consent is freely given, special consideration shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance"
"of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not"
"necessary for the performance of that contract; and"
"(d)   prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed thereof that consent can be withdrawn anytime subject to the"
"provisions of this Act."
