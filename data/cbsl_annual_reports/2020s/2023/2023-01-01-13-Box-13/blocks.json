    "text": "The existence of the safety net leads to moral hazards by encouraging risky behaviour among financial risk takers who believe they will reap the benefits from their risky investments while being protected from losses. Moral hazards can be raised by applying at a uniform rate to all categories of LFCs. SLDILSS should opt to charge a risk based premium while implementing a mechanism to manage the tradeoff between moral hazard and placing an additional burden of a higher premium on banks that are already weak. However, the imposition of market based risk premiums could negatively impact the share prices of already weak banks due to the higher premium burden. Accordingly, appropriate controls are required to ensure a balance between financial stability and market discipline, such as the introduction of risk based premiums, exclusion of certain deposit categories from the coverage, intensive supervision and regulation, and timely intervention and resolution of distressed institutions. Allowing insolvent financial institutions to fail and imposing costs on those that come close to failing can be the most effective way for the marketplace to discipline financial risk takers and limit moral hazard within the design of the safety net. A reasonable balance between moral hazard and a stable financial system would permit a very limited exception for failures that pose a systemic risk, while allowing the market to discipline improvident behavior. Thus, insolvent banks should in general be allowed to fail and shareholders should lose their equity if a bank is assisted to stay open. This proper balance between",
