This is more important during economic shocks and stressful circumstances. However, throughout history, breach of trust in the banking system and depositor runs have caused significant negative impact on the economic activities across the globe, leading to systemic financial crises. Common causes of these systemic crises can be mainly identified as high leverage, booming credit, weakening of credit evaluation standards, lapses in governance and risk management, property and other asset bubbles, excessive exposure to the government, inadequate supervision, and often a high external current account deficit. As revealed by international examples such as the East Asian crisis (1997), GFC (2007-2008) and European crisis (2010), the financial distress resulting from a systemic crisis typically lasts for several years, largely resulting in considerable economic contractions and high fiscal costs, affecting the entire society.",

GFC showed that a crisis can emerge even in a stable economic environment and merely microprudential policies would not be adequate to prevent such a crisis as regulatory policies were focused on individual institutions with no policies available to deal with systemic risks. Systemic risk is defined as the risk of disruptions to the provision of financial services that is caused by an impairment of all or parts of the financial system and can cause serious negative consequences for the real economy (International Monetary Fund, Financial Stability Board, and Bank for International Settlements, 2009). Hence, GFC raised the need for a strong macroprudential policy framework to constrain the buildup of risks in the financial system. Central Banks in the post GFC era recognised the significance of linkages between the macroeconomy and the financial system vis-a-vis macrofinancial linkages. Thus, it became apparent that it is vital to identify macrofinancial linkages and interdependence of institutions while systemic risks need to be contained by dedicated financial sector policies.",

Hence, the real time uncertainty and evolving nature of systemic risk over the cycle requires constant assessment of developments and evaluation of the adequacy of macroprudential policy responses. In this sense, macroprudential policy represents a proactive approach to prudential regulation through a set of instruments and measures that respond flexibly when warranted in a time varying fashion over the financial cycle. The macroprudential stance that aggregates the overall macroprudential policy mix tends to tighten in the expansionary phase of the financial cycle1 as cyclical risks tend to accumulate and loosen in the recessionary phase of the cycle (see Figure B 10.1).",

    "text": "The tendency to mobilise all available policy tools (including prudential policies) to stabilise the real economy in response to large shocks has been observed since GFC in 2009. Moreover, this was more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic where prudential policies played an important macro-stabilisation role along with more traditional fiscal and monetary policy measures and a vital role in Central Banks\u2019 policy mix (Warjiyo and Juhro, 2022). While macroprudential policy may have to be implemented with other policies, there is a high level of interaction with monetary policy and microprudential policy. Accordingly, monetary and financial system stability objectives and tools can conflict with or complement each other. For instance, monetary policy may under certain circumstances contribute to the buildup of imbalances and influence risk taking behaviour of agents. For example, prolonged accommodative monetary policy periods may lead to asset price bubbles and excessive credit growth episodes. Hence, there might be a need for countercyclical macroprudential policy tools to combat financial stability risks. On the other hand, a stable financial system enables smooth transmission of monetary policy and better allocation of resources in the economy. This close relationship predetermines the need to monitor, analyse, and assess the impact of monetary and macroprudential policies and measures on the attainment of such policy objectives and, if necessary, to coordinate between the said policies. Moreover, the activities of macroprudential policy and microprudential oversight also complement each other as they use the same information base, and a substantial amount of the information obtained during microprudential supervision is considered in macroprudential policymaking. Such complementarities and conflicts must be carefully considered, and synergistic effects must be used when applicable (Warjiyo and Juhro, 2022). Further, the need for close coordination is necessary as these objectives are hard to be separated and strict separation would be counterproductive.",

    "text": "The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) that emerged mid 2007 caused revived concerns about the need for ensuring financial system stability and a renewed focus on the fundamental role of central banks in managing and preventing systemic crises. In response to the turmoil caused by GFC, central banks around the world used both new and existing tools to supply liquidity to financial institutions and markets extensively. During 2022, the Sri Lankan economy experienced the most severe economic crisis since its independence from the British in 1948. The crisis had an impact on the financial system of the country, increasing the risks and vulnerabilities of the financial system. The domestic money market encountered multidimensional challenges that arose from adverse macroeconomic conditions in the country. Money market liquidity conditions continued to be at deficit levels, while witnessing a significant asymmetry in the distribution of liquidity among market participants due to adherence to stringent counterparty limits. Consequently, market participants excessively resorted to central bank facilities to manage liquidity, requiring an active financial intermediary role from the Central Bank. As such, the Central Bank took remedial measures to exercise its role in providing liquidity through appropriate tools to ensure monetary and financial stability. This article aims to enhance the awareness and understanding of the Central Bank\u2019s policy interventions in addressing the systemic liquidity issues during stress periods to ensure monetary and financial stability in Sri Lanka.",

The prime objective of central bank liquidity management is to regulate the level of aggregate reserves in the banking system to assist the realisation of the policy objectives through steering short term interest rates and the continued functioning of the payments system. Hence, central bank liquidity remains an important variable in facilitating the process of monetary policy implementation, as market interest rates and credit creation are closely related to liquidity. However, in a broader perspective, active liquidity management is more or less related to all core functions within the mandate of the central bank in achieving both price and financial system stability. While it plays an important role in the implementation of monetary policy, the smooth functioning of the payments system and safeguarding of financial system stability also remains vital. Accordingly, monetary policy tools of a central bank used in liquidity management aim to curtail the swings in liquidity and price of money (interest rates), which has an impact on the both objectives of the central bank.",

For example, the Standing Lending Facility (SLF) of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka provides liquidity directly to a particular financial institution to fulfill residual funding needs when conditions in the interbank money market are tightened, or a particular financial institution faces short term funding pressures. Similarly, if a financial institution possesses excess funds at the day end, such excess can be parked at the Central Bank using the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) and earn an interest income. These tools are considered as the conventional tools that the Central Bank uses in liquidity management. Aside from the use of conventional tools and liquidity facilities, financial crises and market uncertainty induce central banks to expand their toolkits for conducting liquidity operations and supplying central bank liquidity to financial institutions and financial markets.",

However, market liquidity conditions continued to be at deficit levels and started witnessing a systemic liquidity shortage caused by asymmetric liquidity distribution among market participants. As the systemic shortage is an aggregate shortage of liquidity situation, as opposed to institution specific shortages, most banking institutions find it challenging to fulfill the Central Bank liquidity requirement (reserve requirement) simultaneously. Such a market-wide stress situation, together with low activity in the interbank money market, could lead to potential financial and macroeconomic stability implications. As banks play an important role in financing the economy and being a key intermediary in the payments and settlements system of the economy, the failure of one bank to fulfill funding liquidity may potentially cause blockages in the entire payments and settlements system and lead to otherwise preventable failures of financial institutions through possible bank runs. Due to the interconnectivity amongst banks and other financial institutions, there can be contagion and spillover effects that could ultimately have widespread implications on financial system stability and public confidence as well as significant implications on the real economy. Hence, considering prolonged systemic liquidity shortages, which posed a threat to financial instability and the Central Bank\u2019s role in preventing and managing a systemic crisis, the Central Bank used a wide range of conventional and unconventional liquidity management tools to ensure both monetary and financial stability.",

    "text": "As a part of the policy toolkit to prepare for the possible systemic risk of the banking sector, the Central Bank strengthened the ELA framework. As per Section 86 of the MLA, in periods of emergency or of imminent financial panic, which directly threaten monetary and banking stability, the Central Bank is allowed to grant extraordinary loans or advances to banking institutions. Accordingly, ELA is an extraordinary loan or advance that the Central Bank uses to provide liquidity to address idiosyncratic (institutional specific) shocks that affect one or a few individual banking institutions. The principal objective of ELA is to avoid the risk that temporary illiquidity leads to insolvency and to mitigate the contagion and spillover effects. When a banking institution faces difficulties in fulfilling funding liquidity, it may lead to a failure of banking institutions. Hence, apart from conducting liquidity management provisions to steer short term interest rates under monetary policy, the Central Bank facilitates ELA to banking institutions as an exceptional means of providing central bank liquidity for banking institutions facing temporary liquidity issues. Accordingly, under the above legal provisions, any banking institution that is considered to be solvent but is facing a temporary illiquid position, is entitled to the ELA facility against a wide array of collaterals at the discretion of the Central Bank to strengthen its liquidity position. This facility is available at a fixed interest rate, generally referred to as the Bank Rate, which is determined using AWNDR, with a margin, at present. Accordingly, this facility is granted to a banking institution using a unique ability to create liquidity in the form of central bank reserves and as a core responsibility of central banks being a Lender of Last Resort (LOLR). Further, banking institutions shall ensure adherence to strict conditions in terms of banking operations, which leads to reduced moral hazards and protects the central bank from losses that could compromise its independence or interfere with its ability to undertake monetary policy.2",

It creates an important pillar for the transmission of monetary policy, the smooth functioning of the payments and settlements system and for protecting financial system stability. Without any doubt, in ensuring financial system stability, the central bank liquidity provision played a vital role in responding to the liquidity crisis faced by the country during its worst economic crisis since independence. In managing unprecedented challenges to the banking and financial system, the Central Bank is compelled to utilise innovative tools to prevent potential liquidity stress depending on domestic money market conditions. In this context, conventional and standard liquidity management tools ensure steering short term interest rates at a level in line with the monetary policy stance, to achieve the objective of price stability. Further, the Central Bank uses unconventional liquidity management tools effectively and in a timely manner to stabilise financial markets alleviating possible significant systemic risks, even in extremely tight liquidity conditions without a significant impact on the strength of the balance sheet of the Central Bank.",

Continuous technological advances, increasing complexity of financial services, and growing competition among market participants have compelled financial regulators to place greater emphasis on consumer awareness and sufficiency of the consumer protection framework. As evident, the Global Financial Crisis that preceded us exposed, among other things, the shortcomings in this important area. This exhibited the need for a more robust consumer protection framework, which could contribute to maintaining public confidence, a necessary ingredient for ensuring financial system stability during a crisis. On the contrary, it is widely accepted that a sound financial consumer protection framework effectively facilitates anticipation, identification, and resolution of issues related to consumer protection in a timely manner, minimising any impact on financial system stability.",

Further, the Finance Business Act Directions No. 01 of 2018 and Finance Leasing Act Directions No. 01 of 2018 outline the financial consumer protection framework for Licensed Finance Companies and Specialised Leasing Companies that ensure the protection of the rights and interests of their financial consumers. The directions specify the minimum standards on financial consumer protection in the areas of disclosure and transparency, consumer education and awareness, responsible business conduct, complaint handling and redress, equitable and fair treatment, and consumer data and privacy protection. These guidelines cover transactions related to savings, lending, and other consumer related activities as well. Similarly, Primary Dealers in government securities are also required to adhere to a customer charter issued in 2013 under the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance, No. 08 of 1923 and the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance, No. 07 of 1937.

    "text": "Implementing an integrated financial consumer protection framework that caters to a diverse set of financial service providers is a daunting task to the financial institutions as well as to the CBSL given the vast differences in terms of size, scope, product and services, and consumer segments. In this regard, most of the large financial entities have already improved their business operations and practices to a great extent to meet the standards expected by the new regulations. However, there could be a number of entities that require significant changes to their existing policies, procedures, operations, resources, infrastructure and systems in order to comply with the requirements of the new regulations. It is expected that such entities would adhere to the regulations within the transitory period offered for the implementation timelines.",

Moral hazards can be raised by applying at a uniform rate to all categories of LFCs. SLDILSS should opt to charge a risk based premium while implementing a mechanism to manage the tradeoff between moral hazard and placing an additional burden of a higher premium on banks that are already weak. However, the imposition of market based risk premiums could negatively impact the share prices of already weak banks due to the higher premium burden. Accordingly, appropriate controls are required to ensure a balance between financial stability and market discipline, such as the introduction of risk based premiums, exclusion of certain deposit categories from the coverage, intensive supervision and regulation, and timely intervention and resolution of distressed institutions. Allowing insolvent financial institutions to fail and imposing costs on those that come close to failing can be the most effective way for the marketplace to discipline financial risk takers and limit moral hazard within the design of the safety net. A reasonable balance between moral hazard and a stable financial system would permit a very limited exception for failures that pose a systemic risk, while allowing the market to discipline improvident behavior. Thus, insolvent banks should in general be allowed to fail and shareholders should lose their equity if a bank is assisted to stay open. This proper balance between",

The finalisation and adoption of the new Banking (Special Provisions) Act would help in achieving these goals. Although larger and more sophisticated financial institutions should be subject to stricter regulatory and supervisory requirements, it is essential to maintain a level playing field for banks and LFCs that conduct essentially the same banking operations.",
