8.1 OverviewD

uring 2022, the financial system weathered headwinds from the most profound economic crisis since

independence. Sovereign rating downgrade by all rating agencies, high sovereign exposure of the

banking sector, economic contraction, acute foreign exchange shortage and high level of inflation

along with the announcement of the standstill on external debt servicing on account of bilateral and commercial

loans by the Government in April 2022 created a significant and unprecedented adverse impact on the activities

of the financial sector and challenged the resilience of the financial system. Nevertheless, the stability of the

banking sector was maintained during 2022 despite the looming challenges arising from continuously declining

credit quality, acute pressure on liquidity, low level of profitability due to high impairments, and deteriorating

capital buffers to absorb unexpected losses. Meanwhile, the sector grew in terms of assets and deposits

while broadly in compliance with the prudential requirements of the Central Bank. The Licensed Finance

Companies and Specialised Leasing Companies sector managed to continue its expansion during 2022 in

terms of assets and deposits with adequate capital and liquidity buffers amidst challenges stemming from

contraction of credit growth, declining profitability and increase in non-performing loans as indicated by Stage

3 loans. A measured adjustment in the exchange rate was allowed by the Monetary Board in early March

2022 in view of the pressure that was building up in the domestic foreign exchange market. However, the

subsequent floating of the exchange rate caused a large depreciation of the exchange rate due to the dearth

of liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market and unfavourable market sentiments. Consequently, the

Central Bank introduced a market guidance on the interbank foreign exchange market to ensure stability in

the exchange rate. Money market liquidity, which remained at a persistently high level of deficit during the

first half of 2022, declined considerably by end December 2022 mainly due to measures taken by the Central

Bank. Meanwhile, money market activities recorded a lackluster performance amidst increased risk aversion

among the participants. The equity market recorded a dismal performance during 2022 reflecting the high

yield for fixed income securities and negative market sentiments against the backdrop of prevailing adverse

macroeconomic conditions. Financial infrastructure continued to support functioning of the financial sector in

this challenging economic environment. Despite all these challenges, a modest improvement was observed

during early 2023 with the gradual easing of liquidity pressures in the foreign exchange and money markets,

and declining yields on government securities, supported by improved market confidence with the approval

of the Extended Fund Facility from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on 20 March 2023. However, debt

restructuring may pose challenges to the financial

sector. Nevertheless, the Government and Central

Bank will take efforts to ensure financial system

stability during the debt restructuring process.

8.2 Performance of the Banking Sector

The stability of the banking sector was

preserved during 2022 despite the looming

challenges arising from continuously declining

credit quality, acute pressure on liquidity, low

level of profitability, and deteriorating capital

levels. Nevertheless, the banking sector maintained

its growth momentum while broadly maintaining

compliance with the prudential requirements.

The banking sector1 continued to

dominate the financial sector, accounting for

61.9 per cent of total assets at end 2022. In line

with the tight monetary policy stance of the Central

Bank and challenging macroeconomic conditions,

credit growth of the banking sector decelerated

during 2022 compared to 2021. Deposits continued

to be the dominant source of funding, while there

was a notable decrease in foreign currency

borrowings during 2022 as a result of sovereign

rating downgrades and the announcement of

standstill on external debt servicing on account of

bilateral and commercial loans by the Government

in April 2022.

Business Expansion

By end 2022, the banking sector comprised

of 30 banks, with 24 Licensed Commercial

Banks (LCBs), which included 11 branches

1 The banking sector comprises of Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) and Licensed Specialised Banks (LSBs). The Central Bank is excluded.

of foreign banks, and 6 Licensed Specialised

Banks (LSBs). The banking sector continued to

support the financial intermediation of the economy

by enhancing banking services and expanding

the banking network. As such, 11 bank branches

and 327 ATMs were established during 2022,

while 3 bank branches and 87 ATMs were closed.

Accordingly, the total number of banking outlets and

ATMs increased to 7,424 and 6,678, respectively,

by end 2022.

The banking sector continued to expand in

terms of its asset base during 2022. The asset

base of the sector increased by Rs. 2.6 trillion

during the year and surpassed Rs. 19 trillion by end

2022, recording a growth of 15.4 per cent compared

to that of 15.1 per cent at end 2021. During the

months of March and April, the Sri Lanka rupee

depreciated by 44.1 per cent against the US dollar,

which resulted in an increase in the growth of

assets denominated in foreign currency. However,

the tight monetary policy stance of the Central

Bank led to a deceleration in loans and receivables

growth from 14.5 per cent as at end 2021 to

5.7 per cent as at end 2022. Meanwhile, the growth

of investments accelerated from 16.4 per cent as

at end 2021 to 19.4 per cent as at end 2022. The

increase in investments during the period was

mainly due to increase in financial investments at

amortised cost by Rs. 1,635.2 billion and financial

assets at fair value through profit or loss by

Rs. 29.9 billion.

Deposits continued to be the main source

of funding and represented 78.8 per cent of

total liabilities, while borrowings accounted

for 9.6 per cent of total liabilities at end 2022.

Term deposits mainly contributed to the increase

in deposits during 2022 while its share in total

deposits increased from 61.0 per cent as at end

2021 to 67.9 per cent as at end 2022. Meanwhile,

savings and demand deposits accounted for

24.3 per cent and 6.9 per cent, respectively, of total

deposits at end 2022. Accordingly, the Current and

Savings Account (CASA) ratio decreased from

38.0 per cent in 2021 to 31.2 per cent in 2022.

Total borrowings of the banking sector decreased

by Rs. 300.4 billion, recording a contraction of

13.8 per cent during 2022, compared to an

increase of Rs. 462.8 billion, which was a growth of

27.1 per cent during 2021. This decrease was

mainly attributed to foreign currency borrowings

which reported a contraction of 55.2 per cent,

reflecting the impact of the sovereign rating

downgrades, while rupee borrowings decreased

by Rs. 171.5 billion, recording a contraction of

11.5 per cent during 2022.

Due to the challenging business environment,

off-balance sheet exposures decreased by

Rs. 26.3 billion, reporting a contraction of

1. Introduction

The banking sector of Sri Lanka plays an integral role in financial intermediation of the country and has a significant share in the financial sector, accounting for 61.9 per cent of total assets as at end 2022. Despite the recent multifaceted challenges, the Sri Lankan banking sector remained resilient as reflected by adequate capital and liquidity buffers. However, in view of the unprecedented levels of stress on the banking sector caused due to various reasons, including the Easter Attacks in 2019, COVID-19 pandemic and recent adverse macroeconomic developments, it is important to ensure that a robust crisis management framework is in place for the sector.

2. Importance of the Stability of the Banking System and Lessons Learnt from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC)

Banking sector stability is vital for efficient financial intermediation in order to promote economic growth and welfare of people. This is more important during economic shocks and stressful circumstances. However, throughout history, breach of trust in the banking system and depositor runs have caused significant negative impact on the economic activities across the globe, leading to systemic financial crises. Common causes of these systemic crises can be mainly identified as high leverage, booming credit, weakening of credit evaluation standards, lapses in governance and risk management, property and other asset bubbles, excessive exposure to the government, inadequate supervision, and often a high external current account deficit. As revealed by international examples such as the East Asian crisis (1997), GFC (2007-2008) and European crisis (2010), the financial distress resulting from a systemic crisis typically lasts for several years, largely resulting in considerable economic contractions and high fiscal costs, affecting the entire society.

Lessons Learnt from the GFC

The GFC of 2007-2008, even though comprising of similarities with past events, was rapidly transmitted across the globe in an unprecedented manner, well beyond the directly affected countries. The main reason for the high degree of contagion of GFC was the origination of the crisis in advanced economies

BOX 9The Role of Central Banks in Preventing Systemic Financial Crises and Restoring Public Confidence in the Banking Sector

with widespread financial networks and linkages in international financial markets. The new and extreme challenges resulting from GFC paved the way for the central banks and policy makers around the world to introduce innovative crisis management tools, while understanding the gaps and weaknesses in legal and policy frameworks.

With a view to addressing the above weaknesses, the global leaders came into a consensus that an effective crisis management framework with a strong financial safety-net is required in order to support the orderly management of failing financial institutions and thereby to mitigate the contagion effect on the financial system and spillover effect on the real economy. An effective crisis management framework would generally comprise the following pillars (International Monetary Fund, 2020):

(i) An institutional framework for crisis preparedness

(ii) Supervisory early intervention

(iii) Emergency liquidity assistance

(iv) Resolution of financial institutions

(i) An Institutional Framework for Crisis Preparedness

In order for a crisis management framework to be effective, a strong and independent institutional framework with effective policy coordination between the core entities of the financial safety-net is vital. The core entities of the financial safety-net can be identified as the Central Bank, financial supervisory and regulatory agencies, resolution authority, and Ministry of Finance. These entities must have clear mandates and adequate independence to be able to prepare, coordinate, and execute the crisis management tasks at any given circumstance.

(ii) Supervisory Early Intervention

Early action of the supervisor enables proactive detection of the warning signs of deterioration in the financial condition of banking institutions and thereby reduce the probability and costs of financial distress of such institutions. Supervisors need adequate resources, strong legal authority and protection, a clear

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

2488

mandate and operational independence with strong governance structures, in order to ensure proactive and comprehensive supervision.

(iii) Emergency Liquidity Assistance by Central Banks

Provision of emergency liquidity assistance forms an integral part of a crisis management framework as it enables central banks to mitigate the risk of temporary illiquidity of one or few financial institutions leading to insolvency of such institutions or systemic financial instability. Accordingly, framework for lending under emergency liquidity assistance should be well established by central banks as a crisis preparedness tool. Further, such liquidity provision should be subject to safeguards of protecting central bank balance sheets while reducing moral hazard.

Prior to GFC, the underlying concept of emergency liquidity assistance was that central banks should lend only to those banks possessing good collateral, with the assumption that a bank which lacks such collateral was insolvent. The key lessons learnt from GFC, which helped central banks to make significant improvements in the framework for lending under emergency liquidity assistance, can be summarised as follows (International Monetary Fund, 2020):

(a) Eligibility – All banks shall be eligible, not just the systemically important banks. In some instances, central banks should have the ability to provide these facilities to nonbank financial companies that are systemic, to preserve financial stability.

(b) Solvency – Lending shall be at the discretion of central banks to entities that are deemed by the supervisor as solvent and viable. The solvency and viability assessment should involve forward and backward-looking expert judgments. In the event where such assistance is granted to insolvent firms, an indemnity should be sought from the government.

(c) Collateral – Facilities shall always be adequately collateralised and central banks should be able to accept a wide range of unencumbered assets as collaterals. Systems should be in place to value such assets, including predetermined haircuts together with sound processes to settle, manage and realise collateral in case of counterparty default.

Key Challenges in Providing Emergency Liquidity Assistance - Stigma, i.e., the unwillingness of banks to approach central bank liquidity assistance owing to the potential erosion of public confidence, lending in foreign currency and facilitating banks which are under resolution, are the key challenges confronted by central banks.

(iv) Resolution of Financial Institutions

An effective resolution regime is of paramount importance for a strong crisis management framework, due to its criticality in addressing the problems of weak or failing banks without undermining financial system stability. Once a banking institution is identified as insolvent, likely to become insolvent or it is identified to be in serious breach of regulatory requirements, sound, decisive and rapid actions are required to maintain public confidence, while preventing any spillover effects to the larger economy. The principles embodied in international best practices of resolution aim to ensure that the authorities have powers and tools to act quickly to preserve financial system stability, while safeguarding the interests of depositors and creditors.

Even after 15 years from GFC, the global financial stability risks reflect an increasing trend particularly since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, as indicated by excessive inflation, rising interest rates, and volatility in financial markets. The recent collapse of California’s Silicon Valley Bank and New York’s Signature Bank caused severe shock across the global financial system, while the uncertainties indicated in the European markets echoed the necessity of having an effective crisis management framework.

3. Preventing Systemic Financial Crisis and Restoring Public Confidence in the Sri Lankan Banking Sector

Sri Lanka endured a series of multifaceted challenges in the last three years since 2020, with the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, the biggest health and economic disaster in history. The post-pandemic disruptions together with slow recovery of the economic activities, political uncertainties, and structural issues in the economy in Sri Lanka gave rise to extraordinary macroeconomic conditions including declining external reserves, currency devaluation, fiscal sector imbalances, high inflation, scarcity of essential consumer goods, and raw materials. These exceptional circumstances caused unprecedented levels of stress on the banking sector leading to numerous challenges.

3.1. Measures Implemented by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to Preserve the Financial System Stability amidst Current Challenges

There are several alternatives for the Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) to avail liquidity from CBSL during ordinary circumstances, as highlighted below.

(a) Standing Lending Facility – Collateralised overnight lending to LCBs

(b) Intraday Liquidity Facility – Collateralised intraday lending to LCBs

(c) Term Repo Facility – Providing liquidity to LCBs via Open Market Operations Auctions

However, these alternatives may not ensure adequate liquidity for the banking sector during exceptional circumstances that emanate from extreme adverse economic and market developments.

3.2. Crisis Management Tools Adopted by CBSL

Amidst the recent extraordinary macroeconomic developments that continued in Sri Lanka since the outbreak of the pandemic, several measures were initiated by CBSL to strengthen the crisis preparedness of the banking sector, by improving liquidity in the sector to adequate levels with the objective of preserving financial system stability, while safeguarding public confidence on the financial system. This article explains mainly the preemptive measures implemented by CBSL, inter-alia, the framework on Emergency Loans and Advances (ELA) to the banking sector, strengthening the bank resolution framework, establishment of the crisis management committee and enhanced supervisory approaches.

3.2.1. Lender of Last Resort: Framework on ELA

As per the existing Monetary Law Act (MLA) No. 58 of 1949, under its core objective of financial system stability, CBSL is entrusted with the ultimate responsibility of ensuring public confidence on the financial system. In this context, acting as the Lender of Last Resort (LOLR) is one of the key roles to be undertaken by CBSL to minimise any adverse implications that may arise in the financial system by promoting the safety and soundness of financial institutions.

As the LOLR for the Sri Lankan banking sector, CBSL is empowered and responsible for exercising applicable provisions/measures available under MLA to

pre-empt any adverse developments that might cause any systemic financial panic. Accordingly, CBSL established the framework on ELA in 2020, under Section 86 of MLA to prevent any threat to monetary and banking stability. Strengthening the liquidity position of banking institutions to ensure continued supply of credit to the economy and to meet urgent liquidity requirements during exceptional circumstances, thereby maintaining public confidence on the financial system was the main outcome expected from the ELA framework.

In 2022, the ELA framework of CBSL was further enhanced by incorporating a broader range of collaterals with valuation methodology, criteria on liquidity and solvency assessment, supervisory actions and an improved coordination mechanism among the departments of CBSL that are involved in executing the framework.

3.2.2. Salient Features of the ELA Framework

(a) Eligible Financial Institutions: All LCBs and Licensed Specialized Banks (LSBs) (hereinafter, referred to as “licensed banks”) which are in a temporary liquidity distress, where the bank has exhausted all available liquidity options.

(b) Provision of ELA is at the discretion of CBSL, hence will not be considered as a right of licensed banks.

(c) Currency: ELA will be provided only in Sri Lankan Rupee at all times and will not be provided in foreign currency, in order to mitigate any potential exchange rate risks, currency mismatches and recoverability risks.

(d) Interest rate: The interest rate will be determined by the Monetary Board taking into consideration the prevailing market interest rates and the monetary policy stance.

(e) Acceptable collaterals for providing of ELA: A range of acceptable collateral that encompasses Sri Lanka Government Securities, lands and buildings, and loan receivables secured by selected collateral.

(f) Assessment of the ELA request: ELA will be provided only to a licensed bank that is considered to be solvent, with a view to preventing any adverse impact on the CBSL balance sheet. ELA facility may be granted

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

2508

to a bank which is assessed to be insolvent or likely to become insolvent in future, under exceptional circumstances to mitigate any systemic risks on a case-by-case basis, while an explicit guarantee to be provided by the Government of Sri Lanka to CBSL in the case of absence of adequate collateral with ELA requesting banks.

(g) Supervisory Actions on ELA receiving banks: ELA receiving banks will be subject to intensified supervision of CBSL, while several supervisory restrictions will be imposed on such banks with respect to expansion of the lending portfolio and making discretionary payments.

3.2.3. Strengthening the Bank Resolution Framework

CBSL identified strengthening the resolution framework of licensed banks as an urgent priority under the crisis management framework considering the challenging outlook for the banking sector and the need to strengthen financial sector safety-net measures. Accordingly, measures were taken to draft a Banking (Special Provisions) Act as a supplement to the Banking Act, No. 30 of 1988, by including provisions relating to resolution, deposit insurance, and winding up of licensed banks.

CBSL considered the Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions issued by Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Core Principles for Effective Deposit Insurance Systems issued by the International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI) when drafting the Banking (Special Provisions) Act. It is expected to enact the proposed Banking (Special Provisions) Act during 2023.

3.2.4. Establishing a Crisis Management Committee

The present unprecedented levels of financial and economic distresses in Sri Lanka have given rise to the urgent need of strengthening the policy coordination between competent authorities on financial sector crisis management. The lack of an institutional framework for crisis management has prompted to set up a Financial Sector Crisis Management Committee (FCMC) for

policy coordination between CBSL and Ministry of Finance to focus on crisis preparedness, to reduce the risk of coordination failures, and to minimise the impact of the financial crisis. The proposed FCMC will be assisted by a Technical Committee on Financial Sector Crisis Management (TCMC) and will function in both crisis and non-crisis times. FCMC will be chaired by the Governor and will comprise a Monetary Board member, Secretary to the Treasury, Deputy Secretary of Ministry of Finance and officials of CBSL.

3.2.5. Enhanced Supervision Approaches Adopted by CBSL

Due to the impact of recent macroeconomic developments of the banking sector, the Bank Supervision Department (BSD) of CBSL improved the frequency of reporting to the Monetary Board regarding liquidity and capital positions of the banking sector, while intensifying the supervision of licensed banks.These intensified supervisory measures include close monitoring of financial indicators, undertaking thematic reviews on identified banking functions and frequent adhoc meetings with Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and Key Management Personnel (KMP) of licensed banks on liquidity and capital positions. Further, continuous meetings have been held by the Monetary Board with the Boards of Directors, CEOs, and KMP of licensed banks to better understand individual bank’s positions and crisis preparedness.

3.2.6. Communication Strategy:

The existing communication strategy is currently being expanded to cover broad aspects of crisis preparedness targeting to ensure public confidence in the banking sector.

Way Forward: CBSL intends to further strengthen crisis preparedness measures while operationalising the proposed Banking (Special Provisions) Act and ensuring the readiness for providing of ELA to licensed banks with a view to preserving public confidence and stability in the financial system.

Risks in the Banking Sector

Credit Risk

During 2022, debt moratoria and concessions

on loan repayments were extended to affected

individuals and businesses in certain sectors

due to persistent unfavorable business

conditions. Accordingly, classification of loans

and receivables to non-performing categories

was frozen during the period under moratoria/

concessions and normal classification rules

were applied upon cessation of the moratoria/

concessions. Nevertheless, banks continued to

identify sectors with elevated risks for the purpose

of estimating expected credit losses. Despite the

freezing of classification of credit facilities under

moratoria, Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) as

indicated by Stage 3 loans (including undrawn

amounts) increased by Rs. 447.3 billion during

2022, recording a growth of 53.6 per cent and

reached Rs. 1.3 trillion as at end 2022, compared

instruments at fair value through profit and loss

during 2022 stood at Rs. 11.5 billion and was higher

than Rs. 2.4 billion recorded during 2021. This was

due to more funds being directed to government

securities during 2022 compared to 2021 as a

result of higher yields on government securities

that prevailed during the year.

Equity risk of the banking sector was minimal

throughout 2022. The equities listed under fair

value through profit or loss and fair value through

other comprehensive income portfolio stood at

Rs. 7.4 billion and Rs. 2.2 billion, respectively, as

at end 2022. The low share of equity investments

in the total investment portfolio ensures that the

market risk of the banking sector due to equity

price fluctuations was minimal.

Net foreign currency exposure of the banking

sector increased to a long position of US

dollars 659.4 million at end 2022 compared to a

long position of US dollars 133.2 million at end

2021. Higher decrease in on-balance sheet foreign

currency liabilities compared to the decrease in

on-balance sheet foreign currency assets during

2022 contributed to the increased long position

of the net foreign currency exposure. On-balance

sheet foreign currency assets decreased mainly

due to decline in loans and placements with banks

during the year. Accordingly, net foreign currency

exposure as a percentage of banks’ on-balance

sheet foreign currency assets stood at 4.7 per cent

at end 2022. The banking sector reported a net

foreign currency revaluation gain of Rs. 28.1 billion

during 2022 compared to a gain of Rs. 26.3 billion

during 2021.

above the minimum requirement of 20 per cent,

it declined from 33.8 per cent as at end 2021 to

29.9 per cent as at end 2022. During the year, certain

domestic banks heavily depended on the standing

facilities provided by the Central Bank for their

day-to-day liquidity management. The Credit to

Deposits and Borrowings Ratio slightly decreased

due to lower growth in credit during 2022, while the

Liquid Assets to Total Assets and Liquid Assets to

Deposits ratios also recorded a decline.

The Rupee and All Currency Liquidity

Coverage Ratios (LCRs) of the banking sector

stood at 237.5 per cent and 191.2 per cent,

respectively, by end 2022, well above the

regulatory minimum requirement of 90 per cent.

LCR is the stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid

assets that can be converted easily and immediately

into cash in the secondary market to meet a bank’s

liquidity needs for a period of 30 days under a liquidity

stress scenario. In addition, the Net Stable Funding

Ratio (NSFR) introduced in 2019, which requires

banks to maintain sufficient stable funding sources,

stood at 140.8 per cent at end 2022 well above the

regulatory requirement of 90 per cent. Total liquid

assets amounted to Rs. 5.3 trillion as at end 2022,

of which investments in government securities

represented 62.9 per cent. A new mechanism

to monitor the maturity gap was introduced in the

beginning of 2022. Accordingly, the cumulative

maturity gap as a percentage of cumulative outflows

of the banking sector for maturity buckets less

than 12 months periods displayed higher values,

indicating that long term assets are funded by short

term funding products. Despite banks being able to

meet the minimum liquidity requirements, excessive

widening of the maturity gap may lead to an increase

in liquidity risk.

Profitability and Capital Adequacy

Profitability depleted during the year mainly

due to increase in impairment. Interest income

of the banking sector increased by 74.7 per cent

compared to an increase in interest expenses by

106.2 per cent during 2022, resulting in an increase

in net interest income by 37.8 per cent. As a result,

the net interest margin increased from 3.5 per cent

as at end 2021 to 4.0 per cent as at end 2022.

Net interest income increased by Rs. 207.7 billion

during 2022, while non-interest income increased

by Rs. 124.1 billion, mainly due to higher fees and

commission income during 2022. Non-interest

expenses increased by Rs. 59.1 billion, largely due

to the increase in staff cost by Rs. 26.8 billion, while

impairment for loans and other losses increased

by Rs. 298.5 billion during 2022. As a result, profit

before corporate tax was Rs. 192.2 billion in 2022

as per the regulatory reporting, which was Rs. 35.3

billion lower than the profit level recorded in the

previous year.

Profit after tax of the banking industry was

Rs. 150.2 billion during 2022 which recorded

a decrease of 12.7 per cent compared to the

previous year. Possible losses from interest rate

movement on fixed income portfolios of banks

were partially negated through the accounting

flexibility offered in terms of one-off reclassification

of investments from Fair Value through Other

Comprehensive Income portfolio to Amortised Cost

portfolio. The decrease in profits was reflected in

Return on Assets (ROA) before tax, which depleted

from 1.4 per cent as at end 2021 to 1.0 per cent

as at end 2022, while Return on Equity (ROE)

after tax depleted from 13.4 per cent in 2021 to

10.2 per cent in 2022. Further, the Efficiency

Ratio decreased from 38.0 per cent in 2021 to

31.5 per cent in 2022 due to the increases in net

interest income and non-interest income.

The Banking sector was largely in compliance

with the capital requirements during 2022.

However, considering the challenges in raising

fresh capital in the prevailing macroeconomic Table 8.7Profit of the Banking Sector

banking sector to maintain liquidity and facilitate

effective financial intermediation amidst the

multifaceted challenges.

Accordingly, after careful consideration of

the extraordinary circumstances caused by

the current macroeconomic conditions, the

Central Bank introduced certain regulatory

requirements. These include permitting to

draw down on the Capital Conservation Buffer,

reducing the regulatory minimum requirements

for the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and

Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), permitting

licensed banks to stagger the mark-to-market

losses on government securities over two

years, encouraging licensed banks to move

to more sophisticated approaches to compute

risk weighted assets for the operational

risk under capital adequacy requirements,

extending the deadlines to meet the minimum

capital requirements, and the submission of

Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process

document. Further, guidelines were issued to

licensed banks requiring them to maintain liquid

assets of an amount not less than 20 per cent of

total adjusted liabilities on a consolidated basis

for the overall bank until further notice. Licensed

banks were also permitted to maintain LCR and

NSFR at a level not less than 90 per cent up to

end December 2022, with enhanced supervision

and frequent reporting.

Further, restrictions on discretionary

payments of licensed banks were reintroduced,

considering the possible adverse impact

on liquidity and other key performance

indicators of licensed banks due to prevailing

macroeconomic conditions and the importance

of maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity and

conditions, the deadline to meet the enhanced

minimum capital requirement of Rs. 20.0 billion

for domestically incorporated LCBs and Rs. 7.5

billion for LSBs was extended till December 2023.

Banks were encouraged to raise high quality

capital to absorb the potential losses from the risks

arising from challenging business conditions. As

a result, banks increased Tier I capital through

the retention of profits (Rs. 64.0 billion), increase

in reserves (Rs. 44.7 billion), and issuance of

new shares (Rs. 14.6 billion) during 2022. The

regulatory capital of the banking sector reported a

growth of 4.9 per cent during the year, which was

mainly supported by the increase in Tier I capital.

Banking Sector Supervisory and Regulatory Developments during 2022

During 2022, the Central Bank made several

prudential policy interventions, including the

issuance of regulations and strengthening of the

supervisory approach to maintain the resilience

of the banking sector amidst the prevailing

turbulent macroeconomic circumstances. In

the meantime, the Central Bank also cautiously

relaxed some of the regulations to allow the

capital buffers. Accordingly, licensed banks were

required to defer the payment of cash dividends

and repatriation of profits not already declared

until the financial statements/interim financial

statements for the year 2022 were finalised and

audited by its External Auditor. Furthermore,

licensed banks were requested to refrain

from engaging in share buybacks, increasing

management allowances and payments to Board

of Directors, incurring non-essential and/or

non-urgent expenditure while exercising extreme

due diligence and prudence when incurring

capital expenditure until the end of 2022.

Several Orders under the Monetary Law Act,

No.58 of 1949 (MLA) were issued during the

first half of 2022 including amendments to the

limits on interest rates of lending and deposit

products of licensed banks, inclusive of foreign

currency deposits, considering the monetary

policy measures and exchange rate movements.

Subsequently, such limits were revoked in light of

the market developments and the tight monetary

policy stance adopted by the Central Bank.

Similarly, restrictions imposed on forward sales

and purchases of foreign currencies were also

revoked, while reintroducing margin requirements

against imports to curtail imports of non-essential

and non-urgent goods, to preserve the stability of

the exchange rate and foreign currency liquidity

in the banking system.

Moreover, a Direction in relation to

sustainable finance was issued to banks in

2022. Considering the national importance of

promoting sustainable financing initiatives and

the need for providing governance and risk

management framework for licensed banks in

respect of sustainable finance activities, Banking

Act Directions on Sustainable Finance Activities

of Licensed Banks were issued in line with the

Road Map for Sustainable Finance in Sri Lanka.

The Central Bank requested licensed banks

to provide broader concessions to borrowers

affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and

subsequent extraordinary macroeconomic

circumstances to unwind the moratoria granted

for general and tourism activities. Licensed banks

were requested to provide appropriate concessions,

for a period of six months until end December

2022, to borrowers whose income or businesses

have been adversely affected due to the current

macroeconomic conditions and/or the COVID-19

pandemic on a case-by-case basis based on

the future repayment capacity of individuals and

viability of businesses/ projects while preventing

any undue stress on the banking sector stability.

Further, a Circular was issued providing guidelines

to establish post COVID-19 revival units to identify

and assist under performing and non-performing

borrowers of licensed banks who were affected by

COVID-19 and were facing financial difficulties due

to reduction of income or sales and reduction or

impairment of business operations or the closure

of business etc.

Several key regulatory measures were

introduced during 2022 in addition to the

aforementioned measures. Those include

amending the Customer Charter of licensed

banks, introducing specific measures to improve

accessibility to banking services for customers with

special needs, determination of Indian Rupee as a

designated foreign currency, informing banks the

annual licence fees for the calendar year 2023, and

mandating the recording of Unique Identification

Numbers of the depositors of licensed banks.

FINANCIAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM STABILITY

Background

The new Central Bank Act, which is expected to be enacted, recognises securing financial system stability as an objective of the Central Bank while designating it as the Macroprudential Authority of Sri Lanka. As such, the new Act expands the Central Bank’s mandate and scope in its current role in maintaining financial system stability. Accordingly, this article intends to educate stakeholders on concepts of macroprudential policies and systemic risk, interactions between macroprudential polices and other Central Bank policies, macroprudential tools and targeted aspects, the Central Bank’s role as the macroprudential authority of Sri Lanka and the way forward.

Macroprudential Policies and Systemic Risk

The importance of a macroprudential approach to central banking surfaced from lessons learnt from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007-2009. GFC showed that a crisis can emerge even in a stable economic environment and merely microprudential policies would not be adequate to prevent such a crisis as regulatory policies were focused on individual institutions with no policies available to deal with systemic risks. Systemic risk is defined as the risk of disruptions to the provision of financial services that is caused by an impairment of all or parts of the financial system and can cause serious negative consequences for the real economy (International Monetary Fund, Financial Stability Board, and Bank for International Settlements, 2009). Hence, GFC raised the need for a strong macroprudential policy framework to constrain the buildup of risks in the financial system. Central Banks in the post GFC era recognised the significance of linkages between the macroeconomy and the financial system vis-a-vis macrofinancial linkages. Thus, it became apparent that it is vital to identify macrofinancial linkages and interdependence of institutions while systemic risks need to be contained by dedicated financial sector policies.

Thus, ‘macroprudential’ refers to an approach to financial regulation that fills the gap between conventional macroeconomic policy and traditional microprudential regulation of individual financial

BOX 10Establishment of a Macroprudential Authority in Sri Lanka

institutions (Elliott, 2011). Accordingly, macroprudential policy fills the gap by safeguarding financial system stability by limiting ‘systemic risk’ and strengthening the resilience of the financial system.

Systemic risk often arises gradually and unobserved, and such risks in the financial system may not show obvious signs of an adverse situation or a series of adverse developments. Hence, the real time uncertainty and evolving nature of systemic risk over the cycle requires constant assessment of developments and evaluation of the adequacy of macroprudential policy responses. In this sense, macroprudential policy represents a proactive approach to prudential regulation through a set of instruments and measures that respond flexibly when warranted in a time varying fashion over the financial cycle. The macroprudential stance that aggregates the overall macroprudential policy mix tends to tighten in the expansionary phase of the financial cycle1 as cyclical risks tend to accumulate and loosen in the recessionary phase of the cycle (see Figure B 10.1).

Macroprudential policy aims to contain systemic risk through two components, i.e., cross sectional and cyclical. The cross sectional component focuses on mitigating or developing resistance for risk of failure that arises from externalities on individual systemically important financial institutions and the systemic risk that arises from the interconnectedness of a financial institution within the financial system. Meanwhile, the

1 Similar to the economic cycle, the financial cycle has an expansionary phase, a recessionary phase and turning points – a peak and a trough. The financial cycle may at times follow an atypical course with some of these phases either not occurring at all or lasting an unusually short or long time.

cyclical component attempts to mitigate or develop resilience for systemic risk in the time dimension (Adrian, 2017). Such cyclical threats include asset price bubbles that are associated with rapidly growing leverage and credit conditions (Elliott, Feldberg, & Lehnert, 2013).

Interactions with Other Policies

The tendency to mobilise all available policy tools (including prudential policies) to stabilise the real economy in response to large shocks has been observed since GFC in 2009. Moreover, this was more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic where prudential policies played an important macro-stabilisation role along with more traditional fiscal and monetary policy measures and a vital role in Central Banks’ policy mix (Warjiyo and Juhro, 2022). While macroprudential policy may have to be implemented with other policies, there is a high level of interaction with monetary policy and microprudential policy. Accordingly, monetary and financial system stability objectives and tools can conflict with or complement each other. For instance, monetary policy may under certain circumstances contribute to the buildup of imbalances and influence risk taking behaviour of agents. For example, prolonged accommodative monetary policy periods may lead to asset price bubbles and excessive credit growth episodes. Hence, there might be a need for countercyclical macroprudential policy tools to combat financial stability risks. On the other hand, a stable financial system enables smooth transmission of monetary policy and better allocation of resources in the economy. This close relationship predetermines the need to monitor, analyse, and assess the impact of monetary and macroprudential policies and measures on the attainment of such policy objectives and, if necessary, to coordinate between the said policies. Moreover, the activities of macroprudential policy and microprudential oversight also complement each other as they use the same information base, and a substantial amount of the information obtained during microprudential supervision is considered in macroprudential policymaking. Such complementarities and conflicts must be carefully considered, and synergistic effects must be used when applicable (Warjiyo and Juhro, 2022). Further, the need for close coordination is necessary as these objectives are hard to be separated and strict separation would be counterproductive.

Operationalising the Macroprudential Framework - Policy Tools and Targeted Aspects

Policymakers use a variety of macroprudential tools to minimise the frequency and severity of a systemic risk. Macroprudential tools thus used can be categorised into broad based tools, sectoral (e.g. household/corporate) tools, liquidity tools, and structural tools.

Broad based tools affect all credit exposures of the banking system and can include Countercyclical Capital Buffers (CCyBs), leverage ratios, and dynamic loan loss provisioning requirements (DPRs) (International Monetray Fund, 2014). Sectoral tools can address vulnerabilities arising from excessive credit to specific sectors such as the household and corporate sectors, and include imposing/increasing sectoral capital requirements (risk weights), limits on credit growth, Loan to Value (LTV) ratios, and Debt Service to Income (DSTI) ratios. Liquidity tools (for example, liquidity buffer requirements that ensure banks hold enough liquid assets to cover outflows during a stressed period for a few weeks, stable funding requirements that ensure banks hold stable liabilities to fund their illiquid assets such as loans and liquidity charges that impose a levy on non-core funding) contain systemic liquidity risks.

The structural dimension of systemic risk arises from interconnectedness and the risk of contagion from the failure of individual systemic institutions. Structural macroprudential policy tools target two objectives: (1) increasing the resilience of too important to fail institutions; and (2) reducing excessive exposures within the financial system. Identifying and strengthening the resilience of systemically important financial institutions has emerged as the key strategy in addressing the problem of institutions that are “too important to fail,” and capital surcharges on such institutions are increasingly used across countries. Further, discouraging exposures to these institutions or make such exposures more secure are used as strategies to limit the excessive exposures to these financial institutions.

The Central Bank as the Macroprudential Authority in Sri Lanka

Although the Central Bank is engaged in macroprudential analysis, developing tools for such analyses, and introducing policy measures for

FINANCIAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM STABILITY

regulated financial institutions, the new Central Bank Act once enacted will designate the Central Bank as the Macroprudential Authority of the country which will expand its mandate and scope in terms of the current role in maintaining financial system stability. Thus, with the enactment of the new Act, the Central Bank will be entrusted with the responsibilities to work towards its macroprudential objectives in order to maintain the resilience of the financial system even under turbulent economic and financial conditions by periodically updating the overall approach to the use of macroprudential tools. This will include maintenance of healthy credit and leverage conditions among financial institutions without any unsustainable fluctuations as well as preserving the health of such institutions by containing any risks stemming from interconnectedness and failure of systemically important entities. The Central Bank will be vested with powers to monitor the financial system as a whole, assess risks, introduce macroprudential instruments, and make recommendations to other regulators of the financial sector authorities.

Way Forward

The Central Bank has already embarked on strengthening its macroprudential framework with the technical assistance from global experts in this area, while strengthening the frameworks on risk assessment, and calibration of instruments. Dynamic bank solvency stress testing, liquidity stress testing, interconnectedness analysis frameworks, and strengthened data collection frameworks related to such risk analyses have been already established and several fruitful rounds have been completed. The Central Bank is currently developing a series of macroprudential tools targeted at financial sector participants regulated and supervised by the Central Bank or their exposures. In executing the powers vested on the implementation of macroprudential policies and in line with international best practices, the Central Bank will develop and propose prudential standards to be applied by financial sector authorities in respect of financial sector participants regulated by such authorities. In doing so, data gaps are being identified and the Central Bank is working on addressing them. The Central Bank will endeavor to strengthen the institutional framework that

supports its macroprudential mandate once the new Act is enacted to establish a well coordinated mechanism for macroprudential policymaking. In this regard, the Central Bank will strengthen the involvement of the Financial System Oversight Committee (FSOC) in financial stability matters, which will coordinate with the relevant financial sector authorities representing the financial system in implementing proposals/ recommendations made by the Central Bank. The Financial System Stability Review currently being published by the Central Bank will be enriched and will cater to the statutory requirement of publishing a review report on the stability of the financial system on an annual basis. This report will include the Central Bank’s assessment of financial system stability, risks and vulnerabilities identified thereof, an overview of the measures taken by the Central Bank, and other financial sector authorities in the given period to address the risks identified and an overview of the recommendations made by FSOC with the current level of progress in implementation.

With the establishment of the Macroprudential Authority it is expected that the objective of securing financial system stability will be ensured in line with international best practices which would help strengthen financial system stability.

8.3. Performance of Non-Bank Financial Institutions

Licensed Finance Companies and Specialised Leasing Companies Sector

The Licensed Finance Companies (LFCs)

and Specialised Leasing Companies (SLCs)

sector managed to continue its expansion

during 2022 amidst the economic contraction

experienced by the country. Despite challenges

faced from shrinking credit growth, declining

profitability and increase in non-performing loans

as indicated by Stage 3 loans, the LFCs and

SLCs sector grew in terms of assets and deposits

with adequate capital and liquidity buffers during

2022. The Masterplan for consolidation of

Non-Bank Financial Institutions (the Masterplan)

is implemented with the objective of establishing

strong and stable LFCs in the medium term and

thereby safeguarding the interest of depositors

of the sector and preserving the financial system

stability.

Business Expansion

Total assets of the sector amounted to

Rs. 1,611.2 billion by end 2022, representing

5.2 per cent of the total assets of Sri Lanka’s

financial system. By end 2022, the sector

comprised of 36 LFCs3 and 1 SLC and there

were 1,834 branches, of which 1,204 branches

(65.6 per cent) were located outside the Western

Province. Further, 127 new branches were

established by the sector during 2022.

The asset base of the sector expanded by

Rs. 123 billion recording a growth of 8.3 per cent

and stood at Rs. 1,611.2 billion by end 2022,

compared to the 6.1 per cent growth recorded

in 2021. The asset expansion was mainly driven by

the growth of loans and advances portfolio followed

by increase in investments and liquid assets.

Loans and advances accounted for 74.4 per cent

of the total assets of the sector. Finance leases

dominated the loans and advances portfolio of the

sector and accounted for 41.6 per cent of total loans

and advances by end 2022 compared to that of

48.3 per cent by end 2021. The share of leasing

portfolio in total loans and advances decreased as

a result of contraction of the leasing portfolio mainly

due to the continuation of restrictions imposed by the

Government on the importation of motor vehicles

as a measure to restrict foreign currency outflows.

However, the loans and advances portfolio of the

sector recorded a growth of 5.0 per cent and stood

at Rs. 1,199.2 billion at end 2022 compared to the

growth of 9.9 per cent at end 2021. The growth of

loans and advances portfolio was mainly supported

by a surge in the pawning/ gold loans which grew

by 77.5 per cent at end 2022.

During 2022, debt moratoria and

concessions on loan repayments were

extended to assist affected borrowers of the

LFCs and SLCs sector due to the prevailing

extraordinary macroeconomic circumstances.

By end 2022, approximately 13.2 per cent of the

loans and advances portfolio of the LFCs and SLCs

sector were under moratoria.

The investment portfolio of the LFCs and

SLCs sector comprises investments in equities,

corporate debt instruments, government

securities and investment properties. The

investment portfolio recorded a significant growth

of 19.3 per cent reaching Rs. 199.6 billion in 2022

compared to the marginal growth of 5.4 per cent

in 2021, mainly due to the increased investments

in government securities maturing in less than 12

months consequent to increased interest rates

in short term maturities. Other assets that mainly

include cash and balances with banks and financial

institutions also recorded a significant growth of

19.4 per cent in 2022 compared to the 12.4 per cent

contraction in 2021 particularly due to increased

placements with LCBs.

Customer deposits continued to dominate

the liabilities of the LFCs sector accounting

for a share of 53.7 per cent of total liabilities.

Deposits increased by Rs. 81.1 billion recording a

year-on-year growth of 10.4 per cent to Rs. 864.4

billion, while borrowings declined by 1.0 per cent to

Rs. 322.6 billion during 2022.

Risks in the LFCs and SLCs Sector

Credit Risk

The total gross NPLs/Stage 3 loans

increased by 66.1 per cent as at end 2022 on a

year-on-year basis, compared to the decrease

of 13.9 per cent recorded as at end 2021. The

time based classification of NPLs was replaced

with SLFRS 9 based Stage 3 Loans on 01 April

2022, where LFCs were required to adopt 120

days past the due date for classification of Stage

3 loans instead of the earlier classification of 180

days. As a result of changing the loan classification

methodology into a SLFRS based approach,

lapsed debt moratoria, and the impact of adverse

macroeconomic conditions, the sector’s Gross

Stage 3 Loans Ratio substantially increased to

17.5 per cent as at end 2022 from 11.0 per cent

reported as at end 2021.

The net impaired Stage 3 Loans Ratio

increased to 12.3 per cent as at end 2022 from

2.7 per cent reported as at end 2021. The

impairment coverage ratio4 for Stage 3 loans was

reported at 29.6 per cent as at end 2022. The

recent market developments, including interest

rate movements, economic contraction, the

impact of the moratoria schemes granted, and the

introduction of higher taxes, will adversely affect

the asset quality of the sector and its NPLs in the

future.

Interest Rate Risk

Tight monetary policy and concerns over

domestic debt restructuring uncertainties

resulted in a sharp increase in the Treasury

4 Commencing from April 2022, the provision coverage ratio was replaced with impairment coverage ratio calculated as Stage 3 impairment divided by Stage 3 loans.

bill yields. This led to a substantial increase

in maximum interest rates offered by LFCs on

deposits and debt instruments and an upward

revision in lending rates. The interest rate

sensitivity ratio (interest bearing assets as a share

of interest bearing liabilities with maturities of less

than 12 months) increased to 96.8 per cent as

at end 2022 from 85.6 per cent as at end 2021,

indicating a reduction in the exposure to interest

rate risk resulted from increased interest rates in

2022 compared to 2021.

Market Risk

The equity risk in the sector was minimal

throughout the year 2022. The exposure of the

trading portfolio to the equity market declined to

0.3 per cent of total assets in 2022 from

0.8 per cent in 2021.

Liquidity Risk

On an aggregate basis, the sector maintained

liquidity well above the minimum required level

during 2022. The overall regulatory liquid assets

available in the sector was Rs. 184.9 billion as at end

2022, against the stipulated minimum requirement

of Rs. 98.0 billion recording a liquidity surplus

of Rs. 86.9 billion as at end 2022, compared to

Rs. 66.0 billion recorded as at end 2021. However,

the sector may face increased liquidity risk in the

future due to early withdrawals, loan defaults, and

non-availability of funding lines due to adverse

economic conditions.

Profitability and Capital Adequacy

Profitability of the sector declined in 2022

compared to the previous year. The sector’s

Profit After Tax (PAT) reduced by 21.0 per cent

from Rs. 55.6 billion in 2021 to Rs. 43.9 billion

in 2022, mainly due to substantial increase in

interest expenses. The decrease in profitability

was reflected in the significant decrease in the

Return on Equity (ROE) to 12.6 per cent and

Return on Assets (ROA) before tax to 3.7 per cent

in 2022, compared to 20.2 per cent and 5.4 per

cent recorded, respectively, in 2021. The cost to

income ratio increased to 87.3 per cent in 2022,

from 72.6 per cent in 2021, while the efficiency ratio

increased to 68.9 per cent during 2022.

The net interest income of the

sector decreased to Rs. 115.2 billion by

12.3 per cent in 2022 compared with the growth

of 18.2 per cent recorded in 2021. This was due

to the significant increase in interest expenses by

Rs. 70.9 billion, recording a growth of

82.8 per cent, despite the increase in interest

income by Rs. 54.7 billion with a growth of

25.2 per cent due to the substantial increase

in interest rate consequent to the prevailing

macroeconomic environment. As a result, the net

interest margin of the sector decreased to 6.7 per

cent in 2022 from the 8.6 per cent in 2021 contributing

to the decline in the profitability of the sector.

The non-interest income significantly

decreased by 12.1 per cent while

non-interest expenses increased marginally by

0.7 per cent during 2022. The loan loss provisions

made against NPLs declined by Rs. 4.5 billion

largely due to loan loss provision reversals during

first few months of 2022.

The sector showed resilience with capital

maintained well above the minimum regulatory

requirement on an aggregate level during the

year. The capital base improved to Rs. 317.5

billion as at end 2022 compared to Rs. 251.6

billion recorded as at end 2021, due to retained

profits by several large LFCs during the previous

financial year, suspension of the licence of an LFC

with a large negative net worth and enhancement

of capital as a result of the completion of several

consolidation transactions, even though 6 LFCs5

were non-compliant with the minimum core capital

requirement and/or capital adequacy requirements.

The sector’s core capital and total capital ratios

increased significantly to 20.6 per cent and

22.0 per cent, respectively, as at end 2022 from the

reported levels of 15.5 per cent and 17.0 per cent

as at end 2021.

Progress of Implementation of the Masterplan

In 2020, the Masterplan was introduced to

address the weaknesses and risk exposures in

the LFCs and SLCs sector. Under Phase I of the

Masterplan, 5 transactions were fully completed

during 2022 and 3 proposed amalgamations which

were approved by the Monetary Board in 2022 are

currently in progress. Further, the companies that

were unable to find a partner to merge with were

directed to exit from the market upon cancellation of

the licence, and two such transactions are currently

in progress.

Primary Dealer Companies in Government Securities

As at end 2022, there were 6 LCBs, and 7

Primary Dealer Companies (PDCs) registered

as Primary Dealers (PDs) in the government

securities market. Nevertheless, Pan Asia Banking

Corporation PLC and Perpetual Treasuries Limited

were suspended from carrying on the business and

activities of a PD on 15 August 2017 and 06 July

2017, respectively. Participation in primary auctions

was prohibited for Entrust Securities PLC w.e.f.

5 Regulatory restrictions such as deposit caps, lending caps, freeze acceptance of new deposits and granting new loans were imposed on LFCs which were non-compliant with the minimum core capital requirement and/or capital adequacy requirements. Further, several LFCs are in the process of completing transactions under the Masterplan.

24 July 2017. Accordingly, only 5 LCBs and 5 PDCs

were active in the government securities market as

PDs as at end 2022.

Assets

Total assets of PDCs increased by 67.4

per cent to Rs. 131.7 billion in 2022. The total

investment portfolio of government securities,

consisting of trading, Available For Sale (AFS) and

Held To Maturity (HTM) portfolios amounted to

Rs. 126.1 billion as at end 2022, which recorded a

year-on-year increase of 79 per cent. Both trading

and HTM portfolios increased to Rs. 100.7 billion

and 23.8 billion, respectively, as at end 2022 from

Rs. 54.9 billion and Rs. 12 billion, respectively,

recorded as at end 2021, while the AFS portfolio

declined to Rs. 1.7 billion as at end 2022 from

Rs. 3.6 billion prevailed as at end 2021.

Profitability

PDCs reported a Profit After Tax (PAT) of

Rs. 1.7 billion during 2022 compared to the loss of

Rs. 0.4 billion reported during 2021, indicating a

significant increase in profitability. The significant

increase in interest income from investments in

government securities and increased revaluation

gains recorded by PDCs in 2022 compared to

2021, largely contributed to the profits reported

in 2022. Furthermore, ROA and ROE of PDCs

as at end 2022 increased to 3 per cent and

11.4 per cent, respectively, from negative

0.7 per cent and negative 2.5 per cent,

respectively, recorded as at end 2021.

Capital

Equity of PDCs increased by 68.3 per cent

mainly due to profit earned during the year. The

Risk Weighted Capital Adequacy Ratio (RWCAR)

of the PDCs was well above the minimum required

amount of 10 per cent despite a significant reduction

in the RWCAR to 23.2 per cent as at end 2022 from

42.8 per cent reported as at end 2021.

Risks in the PDCs Sector

Market Risk

The proportion of the trading portfolio in the

total investment portfolio of PDCs increased

marginally. The trading portfolio of PDCs was at

79.8 per cent of the total investment portfolio as

at end 2022 compared to 77.8 per cent as at end

2021, reflecting a marginal increase in the relative

market risk exposure of the industry.

Liquidity Risk

The overall liquidity risk exposure of PDCs

increased due to the increase in overnight negative

mismatch in the maturity profile of assets and

liabilities of PDCs as at end 2022. The overnight

negative mismatch in liquidity significantly

increased to Rs. 78.1 billion as at end 2022 from

Rs. 20.3 billion as at end 2021 and recorded a

growth of 270 per cent. This was mainly due to

the significant increase in overnight liabilities by

219.9 per cent at end 2022. Except for one PDC,

which was facing liquidity issues, the liquidity risk

profile of other PDCs remained low throughout the

year, in view of holding a large volume of government

securities and the ability to use such government

securities as collateral for obtaining funds to bridge

any unforeseen liquidity gaps. Most PDCs had

standby contingency funding arrangements to

bridge any liquidity gaps. However, uncertainties

related to possible debt restructuring may increase

credit risk and liquidity risk and may have an

adverse impact on the capital levels of PDCs.

Market Conduct

Primary Market Activities of PDCs

The participation in primary auctions of

Treasury bills and Treasury bonds by PDCs

showed a mixed performance during 2022. Out of

the total bids accepted at 52 Treasury bill auctions

conducted in 2022, the effective participation

of PDCs accounted for 49.5 per cent, and at 24

Treasury bond auctions conducted during 2022,

the effective participation of PDCs accounted for

only 22.4 per cent.

Secondary Market Activities of PDCs

The value of Secondary market transactions

in government securities by PDCs significantly

increased by 204.3 per cent to Rs. 15,423.4 billion

in 2022, out of which repo transactions accounted

for 76.4 per cent. During 2022, outright purchases

increased by 94 per cent, and outright sales

increased by 80.7 per cent compared to 2021.

Licensed Microfinance Companies

The Licensed Microfinance Companies (LMFCs)

sector consisted of 4 companies and reported 18.7

per cent growth of its assets base, reaching Rs. 9.9

billion as at end 2022. Micro-loans accounted for the

largest share of total assets of the LMFCs sector, with

74.1 per cent of representation. Micro-loans

amounted to Rs. 7.4 billion as at end 2022

compared to Rs. 6.9 billion as at end 2021 and

reported a growth of 8.4 per cent. NPLs of LMFCs

stood at 8.7 per cent as at end 2022. The total

deposit base of the sector grew by 19 per cent

in 2022 from Rs. 544 million in 2021 to Rs. 648

million in 2022. With the increase in total liabilities

2021 to Rs. 7.2 billion in 2022, the debt-to-equity

ratio increased to 4.3 per cent as at end 2022.

The core capital level of the sector was reported at

Rs. 2.5 billion and all LMFCs were in compliance

with the minimum prudential regulations on core

capital.

Unit Trusts

The number of Unit Trusts (UTs) in operation

increased to 80 as at end 2022 from 75 reported

companies remained unchanged at 16 as at end

2022 compared to end 2021. The UTs funds were

equally dominated by Money Market Funds and

Income Funds accounting for 22.5 per cent each

of the UT industry. In addition, Gilt Edged Funds,

Growth Funds and Balanced Funds accounted for

15.0 per cent, 12.5 per cent and 12.5 per cent of the

UT industry, respectively.

A contraction was observed in the total asset

base of the UT sector as at end 2022. The total

assets of the sector significantly decreased by

23.1 per cent to Rs. 150 billion as at end 2022 from

Rs. 195 billion as at end 2021. It is observed that

the number of units issued also decreased to 6,283

million as at end 2022 from 7,835 million reported

as at end 2021. However, the total number of unit

holders increased to 67,912 as at end 2022 from

59,426 reported as at end 2021.

The share of investments in government

securities by UTs as a percentage of total net

assets significantly increased to 56.7 per cent

as at end 2022 from 12.1 per cent reported as

at end 2021. Meanwhile, investment in equity

as a percentage of net assets decreased to

7.9 per cent as at end 2022 compared to

9.1 per cent as at end 2021.

Insurance Sector

Despite the challenges emanating from

adverse macroeconomic conditions, the

insurance sector reported modest growth in

terms of asset base and Gross Written Premium

(GWP) as at end 2022. The sector comprised 27

companies in operation as at end 2022, of which

14 operated as exclusive long term insurance

companies and 11 as exclusive general insurance

companies, while 2 as long term and general

insurance businesses. Insurance penetration in

Sri Lanka, calculated based on total premium

as a percentage of GDP, declined to 1 per cent

for the year 2022 from 1.4 per cent for the year

2021, mainly due to high growth in GDP at market

prices driven by high inflation, and decelerating

growth in GWP on year-on-year basis. Insurance

penetration in Sri Lanka remained considerably

low compared to peer countries. During 2022,

insurance penetration of long term and general

insurance sub sectors were 0.6 per cent and

0.5 per cent, respectively.

Business Expansion

The total assets of the insurance sector

grew by 7.4 per cent as at end 2022 and reached

Rs. 947.3 billion. The asset base of the long term

insurance sub sector grew by 5.7 per cent to

Rs. 668.7 billion as at end 2022 compared

to a growth of 12.2 per cent recorded at

end 2021. Meanwhile, the asset base of the

general insurance sub sector increased by

11.8 per cent and reached Rs. 278.6 billion as

at end 2022. The share of the asset base of the

long term insurance sub sector remained high at

70.6 per cent of the total assets of the insurance

sector as at end 2022 with a marginal decrease

from 71.7 per cent recorded as at end 2021.

Corresponding to this decrease, the relative share

of the general insurance sub sector increased to

29.4 per cent of the total assets of the insurance

sector as at end 2022 from 28.3 per cent recorded

at end 2021.

Gross written premium of the insurance

sector grew by 10.3 per cent to Rs. 257.6

billion at end 2022 from Rs. 233.5 billion at

end 2021. Gross written premium of the long

term insurance sub sector and general insurance

sub sector increased by 8.5 per cent and

12.4 per cent, respectively, during the period

under review. However, the long term insurance

sub sector remained the main contributor to the

gross written premium of the sector which recorded

a share of 52.6 per cent at end 2022. The gross

written premium of the motor insurance, the

main business area of the general insurance sub

sector represented 53.5 per cent share of general

insurance and grew by 9.5 per cent at end 2022.

The investment portfolio of the sector grew

by 5.6 per cent year-on-year to Rs. 776.6 billion

at end 2022. The sector investments continued to

be highly concentrated on government securities

and the share of both long term and general

insurance sub sectors’ investments on government

securities increased to 53.8 per cent and

51.3 per cent, respectively, as at end 2022

compared to 46.1 per cent and 45.9 per cent as

at end 2021 with the relatively higher interest rates

that prevailed during 2022. Meanwhile, the share of

investments on equity of the long term and general

2022. In addition, there were 117 Approved Pension

and Provident Funds (APPFs) managed by the

private sector as at end 2022.

Employees’ Provident Fund

The EPF continued to dominate the

Superannuation sector, accounting for

79.6 per cent of total assets of the sector at

end 2022. The total value of the EPF increased

by Rs. 293.7 billion to Rs. 3,459.9 billion as at

end 2022 from Rs. 3,166.1 billion recorded as at

end 2021, recording a 9.3 per cent growth. This

growth was contributed by combined effect of

the net contributions of the members (net amount

of contributions received and refunds paid) and

the income generated through investments of

the Fund. Total liability to the members stood at

Rs. 3,380.6 billion as at end 2022 recording

a 10.2 per cent increase from Rs. 3,066.9

billion as at end 2021. The total contribution

for the year 2022 increased by 17.4 per cent to

Rs. 194.6 billion, while the total amount of refunds

made to the members and their legal heirs was

Rs. 163.0 billion in 2022, which was an increase of

37.9 per cent over 2021. Accordingly, the net

contribution to the Fund was Rs. 31.6 billion in 2022

compared to Rs. 47.5 billion recorded in the previous

year. The annual profit of the Fund decreased

by 11.7 per cent to Rs. 264.1 billion in 2022 from

Rs. 299.1 billion recorded in the previous year. This

was mainly due to the unrealised mark-to-market

marginal growth of 1.3 per cent in profits before

tax mainly due to 31.5 per cent increase recorded in

claims at end 2022.

ROA and ROE of the long term insurance

sub sector declined, while ROA and ROE of

the general insurance sub sector increased at

end 2022 compared to 2021. ROA and ROE of

the long term insurance sub sector decreased to

3.6 per cent and 17.1 per cent, respectively, as

at end 2022 from 3.9 per cent and 17.7 per cent

recorded as at end 2021. Meanwhile, ROA and ROE

of the general insurance sub sectors increased to

10.1 per cent and 20.8 per cent, respectively, as

at end 2022 from 8.0 per cent and 16.3 per cent

recorded at end 2021.

Capital to total assets of both the long term

insurance sub sector and the general insurance

sub sector declined to 20.8 per cent and

47.5 per cent as at end 2022 from 21.3 per cent

and 49.7 per cent, respectively, as at end 2021.

Meanwhile, the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of

the long term insurance sub sector and general

insurance sub sector declined to 303 per cent and

210 per cent, respectively as at end 2022 from

384 per cent and 307 per cent, respectively as at

end 2021.

Superannuation Funds

The total assets of Superannuation funds

were reported at Rs. 4,345.0 billion as at end

2022 contributing to 13.8 per cent of the financial

sector assets. However, the sector is dominated

by the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), which

accounts for 79.6 per cent of the total assets of the

Superannuation sector. There were two publicly

managed funds, namely, the Employees’ Trust Fund

(ETF) and the state sector Public Service Provident

Fund (PSPF) in operation which accounted

10.8 per cent and 2.0 per cent of the total assets

of the Superannuation sector respectively as at end

loss of Rs. 40.9 billion on listed equities during

2022 compared to the unrealised mark-to-market

gain of Rs. 41.8 billion recorded in previous year.

The total investment portfolio (book value)

of the Fund grew by 9.2 per cent to Rs. 3,466.5

billion as at end 2022 from Rs. 3,173.3 billion as

at end 2021. The investment policy of the Fund

is focused on generating an optimal risk adjusted

return to its members, while ensuring the safety

of the Fund and the availability of adequate

level of liquidity to meet refund payments and

other expenses of the Fund. Accordingly, as at

end 2022, the investment portfolio consisted of

96.9 per cent in government securities,

2.3 per cent in equity, 0.7 per cent in corporate

debentures, and the remaining 0.1 per cent in

Reverse Repurchase agreements.

The total investment income of the Fund

was Rs. 315.9 billion in 2022 and recorded

a decrease of 7.7 per cent compared to

Rs. 342.2 billion recorded in the previous

year. Interest income, continued to be the major

source of income of the Fund which grew by

18.9 per cent to Rs. 349.3 billion in 2022 from

Rs. 293.7 billion in 2021. Dividend income

increased by 12.6 per cent to Rs. 7.5 billion in

2022 compared to Rs. 6.7 billion in 2021. As

stated earlier, Listed Equity Portfolio recorded an

unrealized mark-to-market loss of Rs. 40.9 billion

in 2022 compared to unrealised mark-to-market

gain of Rs. 41.8 billion in 2021.

The Fund earned a total gross income of

Rs. 316.2 billion in 2022, recording a decrease

of 7.6 per cent compared to Rs. 342.4 billion in

the previous year. After adjusting for operating

expenditure and tax expenditure, the net profit

for the year 2022 was Rs. 264.1 billion which

is a decrease of 11.7 per cent compared to

Rs. 299.1 billion in 2021. Accordingly, the Return

on Average Investment of EPF in 2022 was

9.96 per cent. Despite substantial increase

recorded in prices of goods and services,

the Fund was able to maintain the operating

expenses to gross income ratio at 0.67 per cent

in 2022. However, the tax expenditure of the

Fund increased by Rs. 7.3 billion compared to

2021 following the increase of interest income

and dividend income in 2022. Nevertheless, the

adoption of SLFRS 9, the Accounting Standard

applicable for classification and measurement

of Financial Instruments, where listed equity

instruments were measured at fair value and also

under the unfavorable conditions in the market,

a net loss of Rs. 40.9 billion was charged from

the investment income for the year 2022. Further,

considering the low interest rates that prevailed

in the market until April 2022, only the funds

invested after May 2022, yielding a high interest

rate as the investable funds accumulated during

the previous periods were invested at low interest

rates.

Further, the size of the Fund compared to the

size of the Sri Lankan capital and financial market,

provided limited investment opportunities,

making EPF to commit its investments mostly

towards Government securities. Such high

dependence on sovereign has created some risk

to the EPF in an environment of possible domestic

debt optimisation. The investment decision

making process of the Fund was challenging

financial conditions prevailed. Considering

the above challenges, the EPF Department

Domestic Money Market

Money Market Liquidity

Liquidity shortage in the domestic money

market declined considerably compared to

end December 2021 and recorded Rs. 231

billion as at end December 2022, although it

remained at a persistently high deficit level

during the first half of 2022. Liquidity deficit,

which was at Rs. 366 billion as at end December

2021, increased substantially during the first

four months of the year 2022, and recorded

a peak level of Rs. 688 billion as at end April

2022. Although subscribing to Treasury bills by

the Central Bank in primary auctions as well as

granting provisional advances and transferring

profits to the Government by the Central Bank

injected liquidity to the market, the substantially

high deficit in the liquidity during 2022 mainly

arose from currency withdrawals from licensed

banks, scheduled foreign loan repayments as

well as the maturities of foreign currency swap

transactions and foreign exchange sales for

financing the importation of essential goods.

However, a gradual decline in the liquidity

deficit was observed from May 2022 onwards

with the increase in deposits in the banking

sector due to high market interest rates and the

Central Bank’s subscription to Treasury bills

through special issuances to support urgent

cash flow needs of the government. In addition,

the Central Bank occasionally infused liquidity

through term reverse repo auctions during 2022

with a view to reducing the significant liquidity

shortage experienced by certain LCBs. As a

result, the liquidity deficit declined as at end

December 2022. Meanwhile, from mid-June

2022 the Central Bank conducted outright

sales of Treasury bills, as needed, to partially

negate the impact of liquidity injections due

to primary purchases of Treasury bills by the

Central Bank. Market liquidity indicated an

asymmetric distribution in 2022, where certain

domestic banks, particularly state banks,

recorded significant liquidity deficits mainly due

to increased borrowings by the Government

from the banking sector, while foreign banks

recorded a notable liquidity surplus.

Money Market Interest Rates

The Average Weighted Call Money Rate

(AWCMR) moved towards the upper bound of

the Standing Rate Corridor (SRC) and remained

stagnant at SRC. In line with the continued

tight monetary policy stance, the Central Bank

increased its policy interest rates by a cumulative

of 950 basis points in four occasions during 2022,

thereby increasing the Standing Deposit Facility

Rate (SDFR) and Standing Lending Facility Rate

(SLFR) to 14.50 per cent and 15.50 per cent,

respectively, by end 2022. In response to the

tight monetary conditions, AWCMR continued

to remain at the upper bound of SRC, thereby

Introduction

The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) that emerged mid 2007 caused revived concerns about the need for ensuring financial system stability and a renewed focus on the fundamental role of central banks in managing and preventing systemic crises. In response to the turmoil caused by GFC, central banks around the world used both new and existing tools to supply liquidity to financial institutions and markets extensively. During 2022, the Sri Lankan economy experienced the most severe economic crisis since its independence from the British in 1948. The crisis had an impact on the financial system of the country, increasing the risks and vulnerabilities of the financial system. The domestic money market encountered multidimensional challenges that arose from adverse macroeconomic conditions in the country. Money market liquidity conditions continued to be at deficit levels, while witnessing a significant asymmetry in the distribution of liquidity among market participants due to adherence to stringent counterparty limits. Consequently, market participants excessively resorted to central bank facilities to manage liquidity, requiring an active financial intermediary role from the Central Bank. As such, the Central Bank took remedial measures to exercise its role in providing liquidity through appropriate tools to ensure monetary and financial stability. This article aims to enhance the awareness and understanding of the Central Bank’s policy interventions in addressing the systemic liquidity issues during stress periods to ensure monetary and financial stability in Sri Lanka.

Role of the Central Bank in Liquidity Management

The word ‘liquidity’ has several broader definitions based on the context within which it is used. Generally, three notions of liquidity are relevant to liquidity management. The first is ‘market liquidity’, which is the ability to trade financial assets on a short notice and without significant losses with a limited impact on market prices. Hence, market liquidity is related to the depth and resilience of the market. The second is ‘funding liquidity’, which refers to how easily financial institutions raise funds by asset sales or borrowings to make settlement obligations in a timely manner at a market acceptable cost. The third is ‘central

BOX 11Central Bank Intervention in Addressing Systemic Liquidity Issues during Stress Periods to Ensure Monetary and Financial Stability

bank liquidity’, which refers to the sum of the reserve balances held with a central bank on a particular day for the purpose of central bank liquidity management. This represents ‘aggregate liquidity’, i.e., the amount of reserves that the central bank supplies to the banking system for the purpose of monetary operation (Cecchetti and Disyatat 2009).

Liquidity management of the central bank is described as the framework, a set of instruments and tools that are being employed in steering the amount of commercial bank reserves to control short term interest rates. The prime objective of central bank liquidity management is to regulate the level of aggregate reserves in the banking system to assist the realisation of the policy objectives through steering short term interest rates and the continued functioning of the payments system. Hence, central bank liquidity remains an important variable in facilitating the process of monetary policy implementation, as market interest rates and credit creation are closely related to liquidity. However, in a broader perspective, active liquidity management is more or less related to all core functions within the mandate of the central bank in achieving both price and financial system stability. While it plays an important role in the implementation of monetary policy, the smooth functioning of the payments system and safeguarding of financial system stability also remains vital. Accordingly, monetary policy tools of a central bank used in liquidity management aim to curtail the swings in liquidity and price of money (interest rates), which has an impact on the both objectives of the central bank.

Central banks and monetary authorities worldwide have introduced conventional and unconventional policies on liquidity management in response to challenges encountered, in view of safeguarding the financial system. Especially in crisis times, central bank liquidity provision can be positively associated with funding and market liquidity. In its capacity as the final liquidity provider, the central bank supplies liquidity to the banking system in different ways. Amongst them, lending through Open Market Operations (OMOs) is the principal liquidity management tool to manage reserves in the banking system, thereby steering the short term interest rates in normal economic

conditions. To provide liquidity on a temporary basis, the central bank engages in transactions with financial institutions whereby the central bank buys government securities, agreeing to resell them back to financial institutions later. Also, to offer liquidity on a permanent basis, the central bank buys securities in the secondary market on an outright basis. As OMOs are conducted through competitive bidding auctions, these auctions are not directed at a specific financial institution. Also, these operations are conducted at the central bank's preference to regulate the aggregate reserve level to ensure the smooth functioning of the payments and settlements system and achieve the target for interbank call market rates in line with the monetary policy stance of the central bank.

Further, central banks also conduct liquidity providing transactions targeted at specific institutions instead of the market as a whole. The standing facility is a typical example of this type of transaction that can take place as and when required by a financial institution based on the availability of the funding liquidity. For example, the Standing Lending Facility (SLF) of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka provides liquidity directly to a particular financial institution to fulfill residual funding needs when conditions in the interbank money market are tightened, or a particular financial institution faces short term funding pressures. Similarly, if a financial institution possesses excess funds at the day end, such excess can be parked at the Central Bank using the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) and earn an interest income. These tools are considered as the conventional tools that the Central Bank uses in liquidity management. Aside from the use of conventional tools and liquidity facilities, financial crises and market uncertainty induce central banks to expand their toolkits for conducting liquidity operations and supplying central bank liquidity to financial institutions and financial markets.

Liquidity Shortage in the Banking System in Sri Lanka

From September 2021, the banking system gradually experienced a systemic liquidity shortage partly due to foreign loan repayments, uncertainty driven currency withdrawals, and the shortfall developed resulting from the intervention of the Central Bank in the forex market. The Central Bank was compelled to implement unprecedented policy measures during 2022, aimed at restoring macroeconomic balance. To reverse the deteriorating economic outlook, the Central

Bank revised policy rates by 700 basis points and introduced subsequent adjustments. However, market liquidity conditions continued to be at deficit levels and started witnessing a systemic liquidity shortage caused by asymmetric liquidity distribution among market participants. As the systemic shortage is an aggregate shortage of liquidity situation, as opposed to institution specific shortages, most banking institutions find it challenging to fulfill the Central Bank liquidity requirement (reserve requirement) simultaneously. Such a market-wide stress situation, together with low activity in the interbank money market, could lead to potential financial and macroeconomic stability implications. As banks play an important role in financing the economy and being a key intermediary in the payments and settlements system of the economy, the failure of one bank to fulfill funding liquidity may potentially cause blockages in the entire payments and settlements system and lead to otherwise preventable failures of financial institutions through possible bank runs. Due to the interconnectivity amongst banks and other financial institutions, there can be contagion and spillover effects that could ultimately have widespread implications on financial system stability and public confidence as well as significant implications on the real economy. Hence, considering prolonged systemic liquidity shortages, which posed a threat to financial instability and the Central Bank’s role in preventing and managing a systemic crisis, the Central Bank used a wide range of conventional and unconventional liquidity management tools to ensure both monetary and financial stability.

Usage of Conventional Tools during the Period of Liquidity Stress

The liquidity deficit in the domestic money market, which remained significantly high during the first half of 2022, declined in the latter part of 2022. With a view to reducing significant liquidity stress among banking institutions, the Central Bank expanded liquidity operations and infused liquidity through term reverse repo auctions and allowed financial institutions to access the standing facilities without any limit as a backstop option in managing liquidity needs on a regular basis. The higher volume of market interventions by the Central Bank is not a new practice, as during the COVID 19 pandemic, the Central Bank intervened in the financial markets at an extraordinary size, pace and scope, aiming at injecting sufficient liquidity into the market and lowering borrowing costs, thus supporting financial markets and their recovery.

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

Accordingly, the Central Bank conducted OMOs extensively and introduced concessional loan schemes by way of accepting a wide array of collaterals (under the Saubagya COVID-19 Renaissance Facility) to provide funding to meet the working capital requirements of businesses affected by the pandemic. However, from the later part of 2022, in spite of the improvements in money market liquidity conditions, market interest rates continued to remain high, partly due to subdued activity in the interbank money markets. At the same time, it has been observed that several Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) have continued to depend excessively on the overnight standing facilities under OMOs of the Central Bank, without considering market based funding options to address their funding liquidity needs. Such LCBs have not indicated any signs of taking remedial actions to reduce the over dependency on overnight facilities offered by the Central Bank, which are available to be used as fallback options after utilising all other funding options. Such behaviour of LCBs affects the efforts of the Central Bank to reactivate the money markets, primarily the interbank call money market and the repo market, while posing a threat to the smooth channelling of funds in the economy with a possibility of clogging the payment and settlement systems.

Accordingly, as a part of unprecedented policy measures taken since April 2022 aiming at restoring overall macroeconomic balance, including preserving the stability of the monetary and financial sector and addressing the risks, the Central Bank imposed restrictions on the availability of standing facilities to LCBs under the OMOs. Hence, with effect from 16 January 2023, SDF, the overnight deposit facility that allows LCBs to park excess liquidity and earn interest, was limited to a maximum of five (05) times per calendar month. At the same time, the SLF, which is the collateralised facility provided for LCBs to fulfill any further shortage of the liquidity requirements from the Central Bank at the end of the day, was also be limited to 90 per cent of the Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR) of each LCB at any given day. As a result of this restriction, daily borrowings of LCBs through SLF declined significantly as LCBs were compelled to take remedial measures to address persistent liquidity issues, while making attempts to raise funds from money markets. Moreover, with restricted SDF to park excess liquidity, the interbank money market started functioning, and reallocations of liquidity from banks with an excess to banks with a deficit were observed. In order to minimise

the market disturbance that could arise from such restriction, the Central Bank conducted term reverse repo auctions to provide liquidity to banking institution until initiating the bank internal correction in near term. Further, these measures were instrumental in inducing a moderation in the market interest rate structure (of both retail interest rates and government security yields) along with improving market liquidity conditions and reduction of perceived risk premium which helped to restore the stability of the Sri Lankan economy, while preserving the stability of the financial system.

Unconventional Tools Used under the Liquidity Management Framework

Additionally, to manage possible future financial shocks and their consequences, numerous measures have been taken under the Central Bank liquidity management provision to safeguard the financial system, while attempting to limit the social cost. The Central Bank used both conventional and unconventional policies on an unprecedented scale to mitigate system-wide liquidity risks. As a part of crisis preparedness and to address systemic liquidity stress, the Central Bank designed non-traditional novel liquidity provision tools to supply liquidity to financial institutions and financial markets, under the provision of the Central Bank governing law and certain such facilities are summarised below:

1. Introducing the Liquidity Assistance Facility of the Central Bank

This facility is enabled under existing legal provisions, i.e., Sections 82 and 83 (1) (c) of the Monetary Law Act (MLA), No. 58 of 1949, where banking institutions are entitled to obtain credit as a liquidity assistance facility for any fixed period not exceeding 180 days upon promissory notes secured by the pledging of government securities at the cost of the Average Weighted New Deposit Rate (AWNDR) with a margin. The amount of credit granted under this facility is determined by the Central Bank after an assessment of the liquidity requirement of the loan requested bank. With this facility, banks have the opportunity to obtain liquidity for a longer tenure than in the OMOs at a relatively competitive price. The facility avail to address the system-wide liquidity stress and to minimise the effect on banking institutions. Hence, this facility is an effective way of dealing with the stigma1 associated with the emergency liquidity assistance facility.

1 This refers to a financial institution’s hesitance to use the central bank facility, expecting that it may send a negative signal about their financial health

2. Strengthening the Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) Facility and its Operational Framework

As a part of the policy toolkit to prepare for the possible systemic risk of the banking sector, the Central Bank strengthened the ELA framework. As per Section 86 of the MLA, in periods of emergency or of imminent financial panic, which directly threaten monetary and banking stability, the Central Bank is allowed to grant extraordinary loans or advances to banking institutions. Accordingly, ELA is an extraordinary loan or advance that the Central Bank uses to provide liquidity to address idiosyncratic (institutional specific) shocks that affect one or a few individual banking institutions. The principal objective of ELA is to avoid the risk that temporary illiquidity leads to insolvency and to mitigate the contagion and spillover effects. When a banking institution faces difficulties in fulfilling funding liquidity, it may lead to a failure of banking institutions. Hence, apart from conducting liquidity management provisions to steer short term interest rates under monetary policy, the Central Bank facilitates ELA to banking institutions as an exceptional means of providing central bank liquidity for banking institutions facing temporary liquidity issues. Accordingly, under the above legal provisions, any banking institution that is considered to be solvent but is facing a temporary illiquid position, is entitled to the ELA facility against a wide array of collaterals at the discretion of the Central Bank to strengthen its liquidity position. This facility is available at a fixed interest rate, generally referred to as the Bank Rate, which is determined using AWNDR, with a margin, at present. Accordingly, this facility is granted to a banking institution using a unique ability to create liquidity in the form of central bank reserves and as a core responsibility of central banks being a Lender of Last Resort (LOLR). Further, banking institutions shall ensure adherence to strict conditions in terms of banking operations, which leads to reduced moral hazards and protects the central bank from losses that could compromise its independence or interfere with its ability to undertake monetary policy.2

By providing the above liquidity facilities, the Central Bank indicates its willingness and ability to act decisively in the event of a financial distress and to eliminate possible vulnerabilities that threaten the solvency of the financial system in advance. It restores system-wide

confidence among the financial market participants

and avoids the fire sales of assets and preserves

functionality of the financial system as a whole.

Conclusion

Central bank liquidity management activities are related to all essential functions within the central bank mandate. It creates an important pillar for the transmission of monetary policy, the smooth functioning of the payments and settlements system and for protecting financial system stability. Without any doubt, in ensuring financial system stability, the central bank liquidity provision played a vital role in responding to the liquidity crisis faced by the country during its worst economic crisis since independence. In managing unprecedented challenges to the banking and financial system, the Central Bank is compelled to utilise innovative tools to prevent potential liquidity stress depending on domestic money market conditions. In this context, conventional and standard liquidity management tools ensure steering short term interest rates at a level in line with the monetary policy stance, to achieve the objective of price stability. Further, the Central Bank uses unconventional liquidity management tools effectively and in a timely manner to stabilise financial markets alleviating possible significant systemic risks, even in extremely tight liquidity conditions without a significant impact on the strength of the balance sheet of the Central Bank.

recording 15.50 per cent as at end December

2022. As the policy interest rates were raised

by a further 100 basis points in the first quarter

of 2023, AWCMR also adjusted upwards by a

similar magnitude. Although AWCMR hovered at

the upper bound of SRC, the call money market

remained less active since mid-April 2022. With

the stringent counterparty limits imposed by

market participants amidst increased uncertainty

in the markets, particularly on account of the

speculation on fiscal sector developments,

transactions in the overnight call money market

were substantially low compared to the first

few months of the year. The Average Weighted

Repo Rate (AWRR) also moved broadly in line

with the movements of AWCMR and remained

at 15.50 per cent as at end December 2022.

Meanwhile, Participating Institutions (PIs)

continued to rely on the facilities provided by

the Central Bank to borrow funds through the

Standing Lending Facility (SLF) or deposit

excess funds at the Standing Deposit Facility

(SDF). PIs with high liquidity shortage continued

to depend excessively on the overnight facility of

the Central Bank ignoring market-based funding

options to address their structural liquidity

needs. Such behaviour, particularly of LCBs

affected active money market transactions and

the effectiveness of monetary policy measures

taken by the Central Bank. Hence, with effect

from 16 January 2023, SDF, the overnight

deposit facility that allows LCBs to park excess

liquidity and earn interest, was limited to a

maximum of 5 times per calendar month. At the

same time, SLF, the facility provided for LCBs

to fulfill any further shortage of the liquidity

requirements from the Central Bank at the end

of the day on overnight basis, was also limited to

90 per cent of the Statutory Reserve Requirement

(SRR) of each LCB at any given day. With the

imposition of restrictions and measures adopted

by LCBs to rectify liquidity issues, an activation

of the money market was observed along with

the improvements in the liquidity levels in the

banking sector.

However, the liquidity condition in the

domestic FX market improved during the

latter part of 2022. In addition to the measures

taken by the Central Bank, this improvement

was led by several initiatives, such as the

restrictions imposed on certain imports by the

Government, prudent FX liquidity management

by banks and reduced demand for FX from State-

Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs) due to

rationalising of fuel demand, price adjustment

for energy related products and cooking

gas, and high cost due to the impact of the

depreciation of the exchange rate and domestic

market interest rates. Further, a gradual surge

in export proceeds conversions was observed in

the last few months of 2022 due to the positive

sentiments of exchange rate stability in light

of the progressive discussions with the IMF.

Further, workers’ remittances appeared to be

increasingly shifting to official channels from

curb markets due to initiatives introduced by the

Central Bank. In addition, earnings from tourism

improved. Accordingly, the supply of FX liquidity

through outright interventions to facilitate

essential imports by the Central Bank was almost

wound up by the end of the year as respective

authorities were encouraged to source their FX

requirements from the market. Thus, with these

developments, incentive schemes offered for

workers’ remittances and the general public

related to FX inflows were terminated in 2022.

The average US dollar buying and selling

exchange rates of commercial banks for

telegraphic transfers as at end 2022 were

Rs. 360.41 and Rs. 371.61, whilst comparative

figures as at end 2021 were Rs. 198.50 and

Rs. 203.00, respectively. Meanwhile, during

2022, the Sri Lanka rupee depreciated against

all major currencies including the sterling pound,

the Indian rupee, and the Australian dollar.

Domestic Foreign Exchange Market

In 2022, the Sri Lanka rupee depreciated

significantly against the US dollar by

44.8 per cent from Rs. 200.43 as at end 2021

to Rs. 363.11 as at end 2022. The exchange

rate, which fluctuated between Rs. 200.00 to

Rs. 203.00 at the beginning of the year, started to

depreciate rapidly after allowing more flexibility

on the exchange rate on 07 March 2022.

However, the persistent Foreign Exchange (FX)

liquidity shortage that prevailed in the domestic

FX market since the COVID-19 pandemic,

plunged to an unprecedented level in early 2022

with demand for FX amidst challenges in raising

foreign funds following continuous sovereign

rating downgrades by global rating agencies

and lack of FX inflows which resulted in a sharp

depletion of usable foreign reserves of the Central

Bank. However, the depreciation pressure was

largely abated by the announcement of a daily

exchange rate guidance to licensed banks with

a variation margin as compelled by the FX

conditions that prevailed at that time, effective

from 13 May 2022. As a result, the exchange

rate started to stabilise gradually at around

Rs. 363.00 level during the second half of 2022.

The Central Bank was a net seller in the

domestic FX market in 2022, similar to 2021.

Despite the sharp depletion of foreign reserves,

the severe liquidity shortage in the domestic FX

market compelled the Central Bank to finance the

importation of essential imports. Accordingly, the

Central Bank supplied US dollars 2,712 million to

the market in 2022. The Central Bank managed

the provision of FX mainly with the purchase of

US dollars 2,133 million based on the mandatory

FX sales requirement imposed on LCBs and

National Savings Bank.

During 2022, trading volumes in the domestic

foreign exchange inter-bank market decreased

by 21.3 per cent compared to that of 2021. In 2022,

the total volume of inter-bank foreign exchange

transactions amounted to US dollars 9.6 billion,

compared to US dollars 12.2 billion in 2021. In line

with this development, the average daily volumes

in the inter-bank foreign exchange market declined

to US dollars 40 million in 2022, from US dollars 50

million in 2021. Further, the total volume of forward

transactions during 2022 decreased to US dollars

4.1 billion compared to US dollars 6.3 billion during

2021 and the spot transaction volumes decreased

to US dollars 0.8 billion in 2022 compared to US

dollars 2.2 billion in 2021.

Government Securities Market

Yield rates of government securities reached

historically high levels during mid November

2022 owing to the announcement of the debt

standstill by the Government, unprecedented

policy rate adjustments, and significantly

high deficit financing requirement of the

Government, which exerted upward pressure

on returns on rupee securities. Weakened

investor confidence mainly due to deteriorated socio

economic conditions and widespread public unrest

coupled with the 700 basis point increase in policy

rates on 08 April 2022 caused a sharp upward

adjustment in yields of government securities in

late April 2022 following a prolonged period of

broadly stable and low interest rates, mainly driven

by the administrative arrangement of announcing a

maximum yield rate of acceptance. Meanwhile, the

announcement of the debt standstill on 12 April 2022

and the subsequent build-up of market speculations

on the Government’s ability to service domestic

debt in the foreseeable future coupled with the

socio political crisis which continued in the following

months, posed a significant challenge to meet the

Government’s substantive funding requirement. The

upward pressure created through the uncertainty

made the yields of government securities reach

historically high levels with investors factoring in

increased risk premia in their investment decisions.

The market preference was skewed towards

91-day maturity at the primary auctions of

Treasury bills compared to relatively longer

182-day and 364-day maturity Treasury

bills. As at end 2022, the yield rates of 91-day,

182-day and 364-day Treasury bills were

recorded at 32.64 per cent, 32.20 per cent and

29.27 per cent, compared to 8.16 per cent,

8.33 per cent and 8.24 per cent recorded as at end

2021, respectively. Unlike Treasury bills, market

preference was tilted towards relatively longer

Equity Market

The Equity Market recorded a bleak

performance in terms of price indices, market

capitalisation and daily turnover during 2022

amidst adverse macroeconomic developments.

Further, a significant volatility in price indices was

observed, and index-based circuit breakers were

activated on several occasions. Ongoing economic

contraction, high inflation, accelerated moves

to raise policy rates domestically and abroad,

an anticipated decline in corporate profits due to

high tax adjustments, geopolitical tensions, and

adverse global economic conditions contributed

to the volatility of the equity market. Even though

the All Share Price Index (ASPI) recorded the

historically highest value of 13,462.4 on 19

January 2022, the indices witnessed a declining

trend since early February 2022, reversing

its expansionary trend observed during 2021.

Accordingly, ASPI and Standard & Poor’s Sri

percentage of GDP declined to 15.9 per cent as at

end 2022 compared to 31.2 per cent as at end 2021.

Meanwhile, the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE)

recorded an average daily turnover of Rs. 2,972.3

million in 2022, which was a considerable decline

compared to Rs.4,888.2 million recorded in 2021.

However, a noticeable improvement in terms

of net foreign inflows was observed during 2022

compared to the previous year owing to foreign

investment attracted by a few major companies.

Accordingly, the market recorded net foreign inflows

of Rs. 30.6 billion (approximately US dollars 74.3

million) during 2022 compared to an outflow of

Rs. 52.6 billion (approximately US dollars 264.4

million) recorded in 2021. In addition, the quantities

of securities held by individuals and institutional

foreign investors recorded a year-on-year growth

of 4.7 per cent and 5.5 per cent, respectively

as at end 2022 compared to the year-on-year

growth of 0.3 per cent and 2.6 per cent, recorded

as at end 2021. However, quantities of securities

held by local individual and institutional investors

recorded a year-on-year growth of 7.2 per cent and

15.1 per cent, respectively, as at end 2022, recording

a significant decline from the year-on-year growth

of 53.3 per cent and 17.8 per cent as at end 2021

with the investor preference shifting towards fixed

income investments with relatively higher interest

rates during 2022.

The market valuation indicators recorded

a significant setback during 2022. The Price

to Earnings Ratio (PER) and Price to Book Value

(PBV) significantly decreased to 4.9 and 0.9 times,

respectively, as at end 2022 compared to PER of

13.6 times and PBV of 1.7 times remained as at end

2021. Meanwhile, there were 4 new equity Initial

Public Offerings (IPOs) that raised Rs. 4.8 billion in

2022, which is a considerable decline compared to

Rs. 12.7 billion raised with 13 IPOs in 2021.

Corporate Debt Securities Market

The Commercial Paper (CP) market was

relatively inactive in 2022 compared to 2021.

During 2022, only Rs. 2.0 billion was raised through

CPs issued with the support of licensed banks

compared to Rs. 5.8 billion raised through issues

in 2021. The interest rates of CPs varied between

11.00 and 36.00 per cent during 2022 compared to

the range of 6.00 to 12.00 per cent reported in the

previous year.

Activities of the corporate debenture market

recorded a significant setback during 2022

compared to 2021 due to the high interest rates

and adverse economic conditions. During 2022,

there were only 10 IPOs of corporate debentures

issued by 4 companies in the CSE, which raised

Rs. 12.7 billion compared to Rs. 84.4 billion

raised in 2021 through 27 IPOs by 14 companies.

Debentures with both fixed and floating interest

rates were issued during 2022, while the fixed

interest rates ranged from 15.42 to 28.00 per cent

compared to the range of 8.00 to 12.00 per cent in

the previous year.

targets. Out of the 82 broad actions of the NFIS

Action Plan, approximately 24 per cent was

completed while other actions are in progress with

the collaboration of key implementing entities.

The first ever island wide financial literacy survey

was successfully completed with the assistance

of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to

understand the current state of financial literacy

across the population. The key survey findings

were made available for public access through the

Central Bank website. A consultative mission was

conducted to obtain technical assistance from the

World Bank in developing a Roadmap for financial

literacy and capacity building. Further, actions

were initiated to conduct a survey to identify

the potentials and barriers in the SME (Small

and Medium Enterprises) sector with the aim of

promoting SMEs to tap the export market.

With the objective of enhancing financial

literacy, the Central Bank initiated several

programmes during the year with the support

of its six Regional Offices. Accordingly, Training

of Trainers (TOT) discussions, Radio and TV

programmes, a knowledge sharing programme,

and a large number of financial literacy,

entrepreneurship, capacity building and skill

development programmes were conducted in

2022.

8.6 Financial Infrastructure

Payment and Settlement Systems

Payment and settlement systems of the

country operated smoothly and efficiently

during 2022 with increased adoption of digital

transactions by both the general public and

payment service providers. During the first half

of 2022, where there was social unrest due to

power cuts and shortages of major commodities,

the Central Bank implemented measures such

as activating its Business Continuity Plan (BCP)

schemes, with the intention of granting

affordable financial facilities for Micro, Small and

Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and individuals,

while providing a range of credit supplementary

services. Accordingly, the total amount of loans

disbursed during 2022 was Rs. 17,244.4 million

among 63,202 beneficiaries through Participating

Financial Institutions (PFIs) under 17 refinance loan

schemes which accounted for 57.6 per cent and

5 interest subsidy and credit guarantee schemes

which accounted for 42.4 per cent.

The Central Bank continued to implement

proactive measures to align loan schemes

operated by the Central Bank during 2022.

Considering adverse economic conditions and

the significant increase in market interest rates,

the interest rate of the Saubagya (Prosperity) loan

scheme was revised upwards from 6.00 per cent to

9.00 per cent during the year. Further, PFIs were

instructed to ensure granting 80 per cent of new

loans to sectors such as agriculture, livestock,

fisheries and related activities considering a

possible food shortage. In addition, debt moratoria

were granted under the loan schemes operated

by the Central Bank to support businesses that

were severely affected by the current economic

situation. Further, operating instructions of the

New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme

(NCRCS) were amended to revise the applicable

interest rates and scale of finance considering the

prevailing economic conditions in the country and

the government policy to encourage agriculture

activities to ensure food security, reducing the

foreign exchange outflow on food imports, making

people more inclined towards agricultural products

and uplifting the socio-economic conditions of small

scale farmers.

Moreover, the Central Bank continued to

monitor the implementation of the National

Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) aligning

with its action plan to ensure achieving the set

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

2828

including Work From Home (WFH) arrangements

for its employees, in order to ensure continuous,

efficient and secure operations of the national

payment and settlement infrastructure, to facilitate

economic activities and to serve the general public.

The systemically important large value

payment and settlement system, the

LankaSettle, comprising of the Real Time Gross

Settlement (RTGS) System and the LankaSecure

System, operated with high availability and

resilience despite disruptions such as power

cuts in 2022. The volume of RTGS transactions

increased by 42 per cent during the period under

consideration, while the value of the total transactions

settled via the RTGS System increased by

181 per cent, from Rs. 295 trillion in 2021 to

Rs. 827 trillion in 2022, owing mainly to the increase

in the volume of SDF and SLF transactions that took

place during 2022. Moreover, PIs utilised an average

daily Intra-Day Liquidity Facility (ILF)7 amounting to

Rs. 658.5 billion during 2022 compared to Rs. 208.5

billion in 2021, indicating a shortage of liquidity in

domestic financial markets. Further, in 2022, the

National Savings Bank became the first LSB to

obtain the participant status of LankaSettle, enabling

it to actively transact in the financial market.

7 The Central Bank provides interest free ILF to ensure that LankaSettle transactions are settled smoothly during the business day.

The LankaSecure system continued to

support all government securities related

transactions during 2022. The aggregate of

Scripless Securities held in LankaSecure as at

end 2022 was Rs.12,848.5 billion (Face Value)

comprising Treasury bills and Treasury bonds

valued at Rs. 4,126.4 billion and Rs. 8,722.1 billion,

respectively. The Scripless Securities Settlement

System of LankaSecure facilitated transactions

amounting to Rs. 1,028.6 trillion during 20228 in

comparison to Rs. 262.8 trillion in 2021.

The retail digital payments in the country

recorded strong growth with the public

increasingly adopting digital payment methods.

Common Electronic Fund Transfer Switch (CEFTS)

which enables real time retail fund transfers through

multiple payment channels, significantly contributed

to the popularity of digital payments in Sri Lanka.

During 2022, CEFTS transaction volume grew

by 67.9 per cent to 91.8 million from 54.7 million,

while the value of CEFTS transactions grew by

80.3 per cent to Rs. 8,881.3 billion from Rs. 4,926.6

billion.

CEFTS forms the technological foundation

for several innovations within the payment

infrastructure, such as the LankaPay Online

8 LankaSecure system settles all government securities related transactions including transactions of primary issuances, secondary market trades (outright, repurchase transactions, pledge transactions), Open Market Operations, Intra-Day Liquidity Facility, etc.

Accordingly, SLIPS facilitated transactions

amounting to Rs. 3,368.4 billion during 2022, which

is a growth of 17.7 per cent compared to 2021.

During 2022, the volume of credit and

debit card transactions increased by

18.1 per cent and 35.6 per cent to 59.9 million

and 146.5 million, respectively, and the value

of credit and debit card transactions grew by

42.1 per cent and 67.4 per cent to Rs. 401.5 billion

and Rs. 528.9 billion, respectively. The increase is

mainly due to the increase in transactions in

e-commerce, mobile payments, and internet

banking.

The Cheque Imaging and Truncation System

(CITS) is the interbank cheque clearing system

of Sri Lanka, which clears the interbank cheque

payments settled on the next business day basis

using cheque images, recorded a declining

trend, in terms of both volume and value of

cheques cleared in the recent years. However,

the value of the cheques recorded an 18.1 per cent

growth during 2022 compared to 2021 mainly due

to businesses being unable to successfully operate

with travel restrictions imposed by the Government

in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the

subsequent lifting of travel restrictions in 2022.

In 2022, the Common ATM Switch (CAS),

which enables cash withdrawals and balance

inquiries from any ATM connected to the

Payment Platform (LPOPP), LANKAQR,

JustPay, and numerous Mobile Payment

Applications. During 2022, LPOPP, which enables

the public to make payments to government

institutions, such as Inland Revenue Department, Sri

Lanka Customs directly from their CASA, recorded

a significant increase in terms of the volume

and value of transactions by 73.5 per cent and

151.4 per cent respectively, showing an increasing

trend in Government institutions shifting towards

digital payments. Even though a significant increase

in LANKAQR transactions was observed during

the previous year, a slight decline in transaction

volume was observed during the first three quarters

of 2022 indicating a need to increase awareness of

both customers and merchants on QR payments.

Further, LankaPay (Pvt) Ltd launched a mobile

remittance application, ‘LankaRemit’ in 2022, in

collaboration with the Central Bank, which enables

migrant workers to remit money to Sri Lanka and

pay utility bills through payment cards issued

overseas.

The Sri Lanka Interbank Payment System

(SLIPS), which facilitates small value bulk fund

transfers such as payments of pensions and

salaries, as well as other retail value payments

that are scheduled or settled on the same day

basis, continued to record a moderate growth in

terms of the value and volume of transactions.

LankaPay CAS network, showed an increase

in the CAS transaction volume by 44.5 per cent

to 84.1 million, and value by 51.0 per cent to

Rs. 1,012.9 billion. As at end 2022, 30 financial

institutions were integrated with the CAS network.

Meanwhile, the Shared ATM Switch, which was

launched in 2015 to provide services to financial

institutions, which do not have the capacity to

operate their own card management system, had

3 members and continued its operations smoothly

during 2022.

The Central Bank continued its regulatory

and supervisory activities related to payment

and settlement systems, in terms of the

Payment and Settlement Systems Act, No. 28 of

2005 and related regulations. Accordingly, on-site

supervision and off-site surveillance were carried

out to ensure the smooth functioning of the services

of Payment Cards and Mobile Payment Systems.

Further, the Central Bank continued to monitor

the compliance of the Mobile Payment Application

Providers, to minimise any risks associated with

mobile payment applications in conducting financial

transactions. In addition, the Central Bank continued

to monitor the BCP and Disaster Recovery (DR)

arrangements of LankaSettle participants by

reviewing their BCP reports and visiting their DR

sites in order to ensure continuation of payment

services with proper contingency planning.

The National Payments Council (NPC)9

played a vital role in several initiatives during

the period by promoting secure digital

transactions by upgrading payment cards to

EMV10 standards, enabling customers to receive

real time notifications and increasing customer

awareness on new digital payment methods

and payment related scams. Additionally, the

10 EMV is a global technology standard for chip-based debit and credit card transactions to increase security and interoperability of card transactions. EMV stands for Europay, Mastercard and Visa, the 3 companies that initially created the standard.

NPC monitored the Payment System Roadmap

2022-2024 to develop the payment system

infrastructure in the country and several NPC

appointed committees conducted studies related

to payment and settlement systems such as new

payment technologies, secured digital transactions

and increasing customer awareness on digital

payment methods. This included conducting a

survey relating to levels of public awareness

on financial scams using digital methods. The

findings resulted in the Central Bank and financial

institutions continuing broad awareness campaigns

to safeguard customers.

Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism

During 2022, the Finance Intelligence Unit

(FIU) continued to perform its core functions

in line with the international standards on

Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the

Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) amidst the

economic crisis that prevailed in the country.

During the year, FIU received 1,481 Suspicious

Transaction Reports (STRs) from Reporting

Institutions (RIs), and the general public. After

analyses, 419 STRs were referred to relevant Law

Enforcement Agencies (LEAs), and Regulatory

Authorities (RAs) for further investigation or

regulatory actions. Meanwhile, 605 STRs were kept

under surveillance, and 134 STRs were subjected

to further study. The remaining STRs were

categorised as no further action is required. Further,

in terms of Section 6 of the Financial Transactions

Reporting Act No. 6 of 2006 (FTRA), FIU received

7.6 million (provisional) Cash Transactions and

10.8 million (provisional) Electronic Fund Transfers

(EFTs-inward and outward) of those exceeding

the reporting threshold of Rs. 1.0 million or its

equivalent in any foreign currency from the RIs,

during the year 2022.

In order to ensure institutional compliance

with the AML/CFT requirements set out in the

FTRA, Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Rules

on Financial Institutions (FIs) and Designated

Non-Finance Businesses and Professions

(DNFBPs), and Regulations issued under the

FTRA, FIU continued to conduct risk based

AML/CFT supervision on FIs and DNFBPs

during the year 2022. Accordingly, 03 risk

based on site examinations, 22 joint risk-based

onsite examinations and 22 offsite/onsite spot

examinations were conducted to assess AML/

CFT compliance of RIs. Furthermore, five thematic

reviews were also conducted on FIs and DNFBPs.

Based on the examinations conducted in 2022,

financial penalties amounting to Rs. 11.75 million

were imposed on 6 licensed banks on violations

of the FTRA and CDD Rules. Also, 8 show cause

letters and 9 warning letters were issued during the

year to FIs on non-compliances with the provisions

of the FTRA and the CDD Rules and Regulations

issued thereunder. The AML/CFT supervision of

DNFBPs was further strengthened by implementing

measures that continued to enhance AML/CFT

compliance.

During the year 2022, FIU took various

actions to bring legislative amendments to the

legal framework on AML/CFT to improve the

effectiveness of the AML/CFT regime of the

country in compliance with international AML/

CFT standards. Furthermore, FIU continued the

conduct of National Risk Assessment (NRA) on

Money Laundering/ Terrorist Financing (ML/TF)

with technical assistance from the World Bank, in

compliance with Recommendation 1 of the Financial

Action Task Force Recommendations. The outcome

of the NRA is expected to be published in the first

half of 2023. In addition, FIU initiated various steps

to enhance the awareness among all stakeholders

involved. In order to strengthen the AML/ CFT

supervision process and institutional compliance,

FIU issued several circulars and conducted

awareness programmes during the year 2022.

Legal Reforms Related to the Financial Sector

During 2022, the Central Bank with the

assistance of various stakeholders including

the Ministry of Finance, Attorney General’s

Department, Legal Draftsman’s Department,

IMF, and World Bank, was engaged in the

drafting of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Bill (CBSL Bill), which was gazetted on 01

November 2019 as a prior action of the IMF

programme. The CBSL Bill captures new areas

in central banking in association with such relevant

stakeholders. The CBSL Bill also includes provisions

for the autonomy of the Central Bank with enhanced

governance standards, advanced Board structure to

secure the objects thereof, enhanced regulatory and

supervisory powers. Once enacted, the CBSL Bill

will replace the MLA.

In addition, the Central Bank was engaged

in drafting several laws which are expected

to contribute to enhancing the stability of

the financial system during 2022. The new

laws include Trading, Clearing and Netting Act,

the Banking (Special Provisions) Act, and the

Microfinance and Credit Regulatory Authority Act

which would enhance the regulatory, supervisory,

and resolution framework of the Central Bank.

In addition, the Central Bank is in the process of

introducing amendments to the Finance Business

Act, No. 42 of 2011, Finance Leasing Act, No. 56

of 2000, Foreign Exchange Act, No. 12 of 2017 and

Payment and Settlement Systems Act, No. 28 of

2005, with a view to enhancing the regulatory and

supervisory authority of the Central Bank in order

to address various challenges arising from market

developments in the country.

Financial Consumer Protection

the financial consumer protection in the context

of the entities regulated by the Central Bank

during 2022. During the year, the Central Bank

Introduction

The level of financial literacy among the population and strength of consumer protection frameworks in place are two integral components that determine financial inclusion, which remains a key ingredient in the sustainable development of a country. Continuous technological advances, increasing complexity of financial services, and growing competition among market participants have compelled financial regulators to place greater emphasis on consumer awareness and sufficiency of the consumer protection framework. As evident, the Global Financial Crisis that preceded us exposed, among other things, the shortcomings in this important area. This exhibited the need for a more robust consumer protection framework, which could contribute to maintaining public confidence, a necessary ingredient for ensuring financial system stability during a crisis. On the contrary, it is widely accepted that a sound financial consumer protection framework effectively facilitates anticipation, identification, and resolution of issues related to consumer protection in a timely manner, minimising any impact on financial system stability.

In this context, being the apex institution in the financial market in the country, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) undertook several initiatives and coordinated efforts through the entities it regulates to increase the level of financial inclusion and financial consumer protection in the country. Consequently, having recognised the limitations of the current consumer protection framework and developments taking place in the rest of the world, CBSL launched an initiative to strengthen the financial consumer protection framework with the engagement of all stakeholders.

Current Financial Consumer Protection Framework of CBSL

The financial sector in Sri Lanka is diverse, with a range of financial service providers subject to different regulatory regimes under different laws and regulations. As the CBSL regulated entities accounts for about 70 per cent of financial sector assets in Sri Lanka, the regulatory measures that will be taken by CBSL in this area are expected to create a significant and lasting impact on the wellbeing of both the financial consumers and overall financial system of the country. Over the years, regulatory departments of CBSL have initiated several actions to strengthen the financial consumer protection framework applicable to entities under their purview.

BOX 12Financial Consumer Protection Framework: A Way Forward

For example, for the first time the Banking Act Directions No. 08 of 2011 on the Customer Charter of Licensed Banks set out a code of conduct that all licensed banks must follow, aimed at fostering a healthy relationship between financial consumers and licensed banks. The Directions list regulatory expectations regarding the introduction and promotion of banking products and services to financial consumers, the implementation of a complaint handling mechanism at the banks level, raising awareness and promoting understanding of the terms and conditions of banking products and services, providing protection from agents of banks and special attention and care for the financial consumers with special needs. Further, the Finance Business Act Directions No. 01 of 2018 and Finance Leasing Act Directions No. 01 of 2018 outline the financial consumer protection framework for Licensed Finance Companies and Specialised Leasing Companies that ensure the protection of the rights and interests of their financial consumers. The directions specify the minimum standards on financial consumer protection in the areas of disclosure and transparency, consumer education and awareness, responsible business conduct, complaint handling and redress, equitable and fair treatment, and consumer data and privacy protection. These guidelines cover transactions related to savings, lending, and other consumer related activities as well. Similarly, Primary Dealers in government securities are also required to adhere to a customer charter issued in 2013 under the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance, No. 08 of 1923 and the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance, No. 07 of 1937. All these initiatives set a fairly solid base for the financial institutions to ensure that consumers are able to make informed decisions and have access to transparent and fair financial services.

Nevertheless, the fragmented approach of existing frameworks of CBSL has created incompatibilities and complexities, hindering the achievement of the overall objective of consumer protection. Thus, CBSL took a policy decision to introduce an integrated and comprehensive financial consumer framework aimed at strengthening the financial consumer protection framework that applies to the entities under its regulation. As a first step in this direction, and in accordance with the decision made by the Monetary Board of CBSL, the Financial Consumer Relations Department (FCRD) was established as a separate department within the CBSL in August 2020. At present, FCRD is working on issuing and implementing a new comprehensive financial

consumer protection framework for entities regulated by CBSL as the medium term target, while serving as the single point of contact for receiving and disseminating all external complaints and grievances directed to CBSL by financial consumers of institutions regulated by CBSL.

New Regulations on Financial Consumer Protection

CBSL with the technical support of IFC and World Bank developed draft Regulations, which are to be issued mid-2023 in terms of Section 10 of the Monetary Law Act, No. 58 of 1949. The draft Regulations were made available for public and industry for observations/consultations in order to make the drafting process transparent and facilitate stakeholder engagement. The proposed regulations have been prepared to cover all entities currently regulated by CBSL, namely Licensed Commercial Banks, Licensed Specialised Banks, Licensed Finance Companies, Specialised Leasing Companies, Money Brokers, and Participants of Payment and Settlement Systems, encompassing the existing consumer protection principles, rules, as well as current practices and possible near-term developments in the consumer protection areas. Due consideration was given to the following directions/areas under these draft regulations:

a. Banking Act Directions No. 08 of 2011 on the Customer Charter of licensed banks.

b. Finance Business Act Directions No. 01 of 2018 and Finance Leasing Act Directions No. 01 of 2018 on the financial customer protection framework for Licensed Finance Companies and Specialised Leasing Companies.

c. Best practices and regulations on consumer protection of other jurisdictions.

d. Current issues of financial consumers and gaps/trends identified by CBSL in relation to consumer protection activities in Sri Lanka.

Accordingly, the draft regulations include the following key areas required for an effective consumer protection framework for entities regulated by CBSL, with the necessary empowerment for CBSL to implement these regulations and closely supervise these entities:

a. Powers, Supervisory Actions of CBSL and Governance by Financial Service Providers

b. Disclosure, Transparency, and Accessibility Procedures

c. Responsible Business Conduct, Complaints Handling, and Redress Mechanism

d. Competitive Environment and Protection of Consumer's Assets and Information

e. Fair and Equitable Treatment for Consumers, Financial Education, and Awareness

These regulations will specially empower CBSL to examine the books, records, accounts, documents, information, and other supervisory activities of CBSL- regulated entities, allowing for effective monitoring of consumer protection and market conduct. Further, these proposed regulations will provide the basis for the market conduct supervision of CBSL-regulated entities as well as enforcement of regulatory actions, enabling the Monetary Board of CBSL to take regulatory actions for market misconduct that affects the financial consumers, the market, or the financial system. Furthermore, these regulations will streamline the two tiered complaint handling procedure of both financial institutions and CBSL and empower CBSL to make binding determinations to financial institutions as one of the out-of-court settlements for valid complaints made by financial consumers. Overall, these regulations will strengthen the current financial consumer protection frameworks of CBSL, particularly Banking Act Directions No. 08 of 2011, Finance Business Act Directions No. 01 of 2018, and Finance Leasing Act Directions No. 01 of 2018, in line with international standards and establish the foundation for market conduct supervision by CBSL facilitating the development of a trusted and stable financial system in Sri Lanka, instilling confidence of financial consumers.

Challenges and Way Forward

Implementing an integrated financial consumer protection framework that caters to a diverse set of financial service providers is a daunting task to the financial institutions as well as to the CBSL given the vast differences in terms of size, scope, product and services, and consumer segments. In this regard, most of the large financial entities have already improved their business operations and practices to a great extent to meet the standards expected by the new regulations. However, there could be a number of entities that require significant changes to their existing policies, procedures, operations, resources, infrastructure and systems in order to comply with the requirements of the new regulations. It is expected that such entities would adhere to the regulations within the transitory period offered for the implementation timelines.

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

received 5,149 complaints and grievances with the

majority being related to requests for concessions

on the financing facilities obtained from such

entities, charging of high interest rates, matters

relating to moratoria, non-provision of information/

documents requested and charging of high fees

and commissions. The Central Bank was able to

conclude around 75 per cent of valid complaints and

grievances of financial consumers received during

the year under review.

A comprehensive set of new regulations was

developed by the Central Bank, enabling the

introduction of an integrated financial consumer

protection framework for entities regulated by

the Central Bank. These regulations are expected

to define specific regulatory powers for supervisors to

facilitate market conduct supervision while providing

clarity to both service providers and recipients on

the areas to be considered in delivering or obtaining

financial services. Draft Regulations were made

available to the industry and public for stakeholder

consultation, and the final regulations are expected

to be effective in mid-2023. In addition, the Central

Bank, with the assistance of the IFC is in the process

of developing a media campaign on financial

consumer awareness, which is to be launched in

early 2023.

Deposit Insurance, Resolution Actions and Investigation over Prohibited Schemes

The Central Bank continued to manage

the Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance and Liquidity

Support Scheme (SLDILSS) to ensure the

maintenance of financial system stability. The

payment of compensation to the insured depositors

of finance companies of whose licenses were

cancelled/suspended, namely Central Investments

and Finance PLC, The Standard Credit Finance

Ltd., TKS Finance Ltd., The Finance Company PLC

Swarnamahal Financial Services PLC, and ETI

Finance Ltd. continued during the year. Accordingly,

SLDILSS paid Rs. 30,499.24 million to 72,641

depositors upto 2022. The quantum of compensation

paid was 86.57 per cent of the total insured value of

Rs. 35,229.22 million.

The Central Bank took initiatives to

strengthen the legal framework of the existing

deposit insurance mechanism of the country by

introducing suitable provisions in the proposed

Banking (Special Provisions) Act. This draft law

also includes provisions aimed at strengthening

the legal framework for resolution for licensed

banks as well as Non-Bank Financial Institutions

licensed, regulated and supervised by Central

Bank. Considering that the draft law addresses

many facets hitherto unknown to Sri Lanka’s legal

infrastructure, the expertise and technical inputs

provided by the IMF and World Bank became very

useful in the drafting process. The draft law which

received the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers in

mid-November 2022 is expected to be enacted by

the Parliament in early 2023.

Accordingly, the Central Bank conducted

several investigations on certain schemes that

are alleged to be contraventions of the provisions

of the Banking Act, No.30 of 1988. Further actions

were taken to follow up on the requests made to

the Attorney General’s Department for prosecution

of offenders already revealed in the investigations

concluded thus far. With a view to improving financial

literacy of different segments of the general public

and in particular to educate them on the negative

effects of joining prohibited schemes, the Central

Bank conducted awareness programmes covering

all possible channels, during the year.

Regulation and Supervision of Foreign Exchange

During 2022, the Central Bank took numerous

steps to promote and regulate foreign exchange

the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Act,

No. 12 of 2017 (FEA). Accordingly, Regulations

and Directions were issued granting permission to

companies incorporated under the Companies Act

No. 07 of 2007 to obtain short term loans from their

overseas parent companies or companies within

the same group of companies incorporated outside

Sri Lanka, to facilitate payments for the import of

raw materials. Further, an amnesty period of two

months was granted to persons who held foreign

currency notes to either deposit the same in

foreign currency accounts or to sell such currency

to an Authorised Dealer (AD), while reducing the

maximum limit applicable for the possession of

foreign currency by residents to US dollars 10,000

from US dollars 15,000. Accordingly, the total

amount of foreign currency sold/deposited during

the amnesty period was US dollars 35.4 million.

Moreover, the Central Bank issued Directions

under the FEA to facilitate transactions under the

“Golden Paradise Visa program” implemented by

the Department of Immigration and Emigration

supporting inward remittances from persons

residing outside Sri Lanka under this scheme.

Furthermore, the validity period for opening

Special Deposit Accounts (SDAs) was extended

and existing SDAs were allowed to be rolled over.

In addition, an Order which was initially issued

under the provisions of the FEA, by the Minister of

Finance to suspend and limit outward remittances

for certain capital transactions, was further

extended during the year.

The Central Bank took various measures

to promote investments and bilateral

trade to improve liquidity in the domestic

foreign exchange market. In order to facilitate

investments and transactions in the Colombo Port

City Special Economic Zone (Colombo Port City),

Regulations and Directions were issued granting

permission to open foreign currency accounts

for investors, investees and employees of the

companies in the Colombo Port City. Further, the

Indian rupee was determined as a designated

foreign currency under the FEA. In addition,

special permissions were granted to open 29

Special Foreign Currency Accounts, mainly to

facilitate the uninterrupted supply of essential

imports amid the tight foreign currency liquidity

situation. Moreover, new Rules were issued under

the MLA, mandating the repatriation of export

proceeds into Sri Lanka within 180 days and

conversion of such proceeds by the exporters of

goods. Accordingly, with continuous monitoring,

an increasing trend in the repatriation of export

proceeds was observed during the year, while the

conversion into Sri Lanka rupees also improved

towards the end of the year. Additionally, the

Central Bank took initiatives to implement

an automated Export Proceeds Monitoring

System (EPMS) to extensively monitor foreign

exchange transactions in collaboration with Sri

Lanka Customs and ADs. Meanwhile, outward

remittances under the migration allowance and the

number of Capital Transaction Rupee Accounts

(CTRAs) opened during the year reduced, while

ADs recorded net foreign exchange purchases

during the year, supporting liquidity conditions in

the domestic foreign exchange market.

The performance of Restricted Dealers

(RDs) was also closely monitored by the

Central Bank during the year and Directions

were issued to RDs that are solely engaged

in money changing business (i.e. Money

Changers), prohibiting the offering of higher

exchange rates with a view to reducing

any undue pressure on the exchange rate.

Accordingly, US dollars 159.8 million was

deposited into the banking system and US

dollars 10.5 million was sold by RDs during the

year, which is a considerable improvement in

performance compared to the previous year

amidst the gradual stabilisation of economic

conditions to some extent and increase in tourist

arrivals by the latter part of the year.

Credit Information

The Credit Information Bureau (CRIB) of Sri

Lanka achieved a major milestone during 2022

with the implementation of the state-of-the-art

Credit Information Management System (CIMS)

with many value additions. As such, the pilot

run of the new system which commenced in May

2022 with the participation of 9 member lending

institutions was successfully completed in July

2022 with positive feedback from the members

involved. Thereafter, the parallel run of the new

system and the legacy system was commenced

in August 2022 enabling access to the new

system to all users in member lending institutions

to familiarise themselves with the new system.

The CIMS was fully launched in December

2022. The new system brings greater efficiency

and international practices to the processes of

CRIB and expands the product portfolio while

revolutionising the risk management and credit

evaluation techniques of lending institutions to

better manage lending portfolios. In addition, this

system will also improve the Bureau’s capacity to

collect non-traditional data.

Meanwhile, CRIB continued its statutory

role as the national credit registry by providing

6.1 million credit reports to member lending

institutions during the year 2022. However, a

27 per cent decrease in credit reports issued was

recorded during 2022, compared to 2021. The

member lending institutions obtained 5.6 million

consumer credit reports and 0.4 million corporate

credit reports in 2022. Moreover, CRIB issued

729,635 credit reports to the lending institutions

through the “Bulk Request” mode during 2022.

Meanwhile, the demand for the self-inquiry credit

reports (iReports) recorded a 13.7 per cent

decrease in 2022, compared to 2021.

1. Introduction

Financial safety nets are a set of institutions, laws, and procedures that seek to promote an efficient and stable banking system during normal economic conditions and to manage the eventuality of a financial crisis. The framework of financial safety nets encompasses prudential regulation, supervision, resolution, lender of last resort, deposit insurance, and the role of Ministry of Finance (MOF) or the Treasury functioning with the broad objectives of promoting economic growth and financial stability of a country. Financial safety nets are important for an economy as a means of supporting crisis prevention mechanisms, financing during a crisis, and promoting sound macroeconomic policies by providing incentives.

The financial system plays a crucial role in the functioning of any economy. Financial institutions, while providing financial intermediation, tend to take on higher risk exposures through their diverse and complex deposit liability profiles. Therefore, financial safety net measures are of utmost importance for an economy to protect less sophisticated depositors. Depending on a country’s supervisory structure, multiple organisations play important roles within the country’s financial safety net. However, in some countries, central banks have exclusive responsibility for bank regulation, supervision, and resolution, and provides explicit or implicit deposit insurance protection as well.

In Sri Lanka, the financial system has undergone notable growth and development in recent years and the increasing complexity of the financial system has made it more vulnerable to financial shocks and crises, while underlining the need for robust financial safety net to strengthen the resilience of the financial system and safeguard the interests of depositors and other stakeholders in the financial system. In order to ensure the strength and efficiency of the country’s financial system, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and MOF collaborate closely as the primary stakeholders in the financial safety net.

2. Role of the Central Bank and Ministry of Finance

The CBSL plays a critical role in the financial safety net mechanism through functions, such as the lender of last resort, the supervisory authority of banks and

BOX 13Strengthening the Financial Safety Net in Sri Lanka

Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs), resolution authority, and deposit insurer of the depositors of Licensed Banks (LBs) and Licensed Finance Companies (LFCs). On the other hand, MOF is a key participant in the financial safety net, responsible for setting financial sector policies during normal economic conditions and playing a pivotal role in crisis management during financial emergencies.

3. Lender of Last Resort

During times of financial turmoil, banks may encounter challenges in obtaining necessary funding for their daily operations and may turn to their lender of last resort, the CBSL. This can occur when banks become hesitant to lend to each other and depositors begin to withdraw their funds from their bank accounts. In such situations, the CBSL serves as the lender of last resort because its prime responsibility is promoting the smooth functioning of financial markets and maintaining a stable financial system.

The CBSL generally executes its lender of last resort function during emergencies that induce financial panic and threaten monetary and banking stability. In such circumstances, the CBSL has the discretion to provide extraordinary loans or advances to banks, secured with any collateral defined as acceptable in the Emergency Loans and Advances (ELA) Framework and may also renew such loans or advances as needed.

Currently, banks are not required to meet any specific requirements to access ELA. However, the CBSL has the discretion over deciding on the applicable interest rates, tenor, renewals, collateral, and other related matters. Nonetheless, if a LB is deemed insolvent, or likely to be insolvent, or has no reasonable prospect of becoming solvent in future, such bank would be ineligible for ELA, except in an exceptional circumstance.

ELA provided by central banks is typically viewed as a measure to address pure liquidity problems in banks that essentially are solvent. However, such situation is rare in practice. In most cases where banks face liquidity problems, there is some uncertainty about the

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

2928

solvency of the institutions involved. The assessment of the solvency of an institution usually takes time and is covered by the prudential regulation and supervisory actions.

4. Prudential Regulation and Supervisory Frameworks

Prudential regulation establishes standards and policies that financial institutions are expected to adhere to. Under the supervisory framework, it monitors the implementation of these standards and policies to ensure the safety and soundness of the financial sector and to achieve the financial system stability objective.

The regulatory and supervisory framework for banks and NBFIs of Sri Lanka is primarily specified in the Monetary Law Act (MLA), No.58 of 1949, the Banking Act, No. 30 of 1988, and the Finance Business Act (FBA), No. 42 of 2011. The CBSL is empowered to license banks and finance companies, issue prudential directions, determinations, orders, and guidelines to licensed entities, conduct supervision and examination and enforce regulatory actions, and resolve weak LBs and LFCs. The CBSL adheres to internationally recognised supervisory standards established by the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision. In order to prepare for potential crises, supervisors require banks and NBFIs to develop and implement contingency plans that include measures to address failures of banks and NBFIs.

5. Deposit Insurance System (DIS)

The role of a deposit insurer is to stabilise the financial system by ensuring public confidence in it, especially in the event of bank failures. The deposit insurer assures depositors that they will have immediate access to their insured funds, even if their bank/NBFI fails, thereby reducing depositors’ the possibility of a "run" on the bank/NBFI and the risk of contagion and foster financial system stability, which in turn would have positive spillover on the wider economy.

DISs are generally governed by institutions called Deposit Insurance Agencies (DIAs), which may have different mandates that range from narrow systems (‘pay-box’) to those with broader powers and responsibilities, such as risk or loss minimisation with a variety of combinations in between. Some DIAs may have a limited ‘pay box’ mandate, which focuses on

the reimbursement of the insured depositors in the event of a financial institution failure. Other DIAs may have an enhanced ‘pay box plus’ mandate, which includes responsibilities and powers related to providing financial assistance for resolution activities of financial institutions such as separating assets, opening a bridge bank, providing open bank assistance, and bailing in, among others. DIAs could also employ a direct mandate, which aims to minimise loss or risk. Loss minimisers operate with the goal of minimising the costs of resolving failed banks, while risk minimisers aim to minimise risk for the financial system as a whole.

6. Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance and Liquidity Support Scheme

The DIA of Sri Lanka is called the Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance and Liquidity Support Scheme (SLDILSS) and falls under the purview of the CBSL. With a view to upholding public trust in the financial system, SLDILSS was established in 2010 as a mandatory Deposit Insurance System invoking the provisions of the MLA, Banking Act, and the then prevailing FBA. SLDILSS is currently governed by the Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance and Liquidity Support Scheme Regulations No.02 of 2021.

SLDILSS has outlined a mechanism to protect small depositors in the event of a failure of a LB or LFC. SLDILSS maintains an Ex-Ante fund called the Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance and Liquidity Support Fund (SLDILSF), and the primary regular source of funding for SLDILSS is the premium paid by Member Institutions (MIs). All LBs and LFCs in Sri Lanka are MIs of SLDILSS and are required to pay insurance premium to the SLDILSS quarterly based on their capital adequacy ratio and monthly at a flat rate, respectively. At present, SLDILSS operates with a ‘pay box’ mandate and functions as a crisis prevention and management tool as well.

7. Strengthening the Financial Safety Net

Proper functioning of the Financial Safety Net is crucial for fostering economic growth, and it is imperative to explore the ways and means of strengthening it. Past financial crises have emphasised the significance of having ample safety net mechanisms at the global, regional, and national levels. It underlines the necessity of a well functioning financial safety net to bolster market confidence during periods of financial strains. Enhanced regional cooperation to uphold

FINANCIAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM STABILITY

293

financial stability and resilience is recognised as vital safeguarding in exigent times. Lack of funding could cause severe challenges and additional costs. Therefore, the resolution authority might resort to resolution techniques that offer required liquidity. In addition, inadequate funding could lead to delays in resolution process. When a resolution authority has to defer resolving an institution, the quality of assets is likely to deteriorate further, and the moral hazard problem becomes more pronounced.

It is essential to streamline and strengthen the legal framework governing the financial safety net in order to improve its effectiveness. Currently, the legal framework governing the bank resolution is dispersed, resulting in a complex, confusing, and often opaque framework. Further, the court driven procedures for banks followed in Sri Lanka are slow paced, which can delay resolution process if the shareholders of a bank challenge the authority of the regulator to resolve the bank. The bureaucratic process involved in bank mergers further complicates the resolution of banks and creates uncertainty, which can potentially destabilise the financial system. This would require addressing the flaws in the current framework and adopting a more efficient and streamlined process for bank resolution and mergers.

Strengthening DIS is vital for improving financial system stability. For over a decade, SLDILSS played a crucial ‘pay box’ role. However, in its efforts to make timely payments to depositors, SLDILSS faces challenges due to inadequate information sharing arrangements regarding depositors, as well as the failure to maintain depositor information under a unique identification number at LBs and LFCs. Addressing these challenges and implementing robust information sharing and identification systems for depositors can go a long way in enhancing the effectiveness of SLDILSS, and ultimately, strengthening the financial system's stability.

Globally, deposit insurance systems, equipped with broad mandates, are assuming a significant role in the resolution of troubled banks. This arrangement provides the insurer with a greater ability to address costs compared to pure ‘pay box’ systems. Thus, SLDILSS should adopt the “least cost” approach for resolving a failed institution. This approach entails closer cooperation and coordination among safety net participants, the Government, regulatory bodies,

the CBSL, and the Deposit Insurer. Experience shows that deposit insurers with sufficiently broad mandates, adequate powers, operational independence, and assured sources of contingency funding are more effective in building and maintaining public confidence and dealing with financial crises. In an extraordinary situation of systemic failure of banks, it is imperative that the deposit insurer has unlimited and quick access to backstop funding so that financial stability is not jeopardised. Overall, the success of the deposit insurance system depends on its ability to provide reliable and effective protection to depositors.

In strengthening the financial safety net, the regulatory and supervisory requirements for banks and NBFIs should be harmonised. In finalising and adopting the new Banking Act, this factor should be taken into consideration.

The existence of the safety net leads to moral hazards by encouraging risky behaviour among financial risk takers who believe they will reap the benefits from their risky investments while being protected from losses. Moral hazards can be raised by applying at a uniform rate to all categories of LFCs. SLDILSS should opt to charge a risk based premium while implementing a mechanism to manage the tradeoff between moral hazard and placing an additional burden of a higher premium on banks that are already weak. However, the imposition of market based risk premiums could negatively impact the share prices of already weak banks due to the higher premium burden. Accordingly, appropriate controls are required to ensure a balance between financial stability and market discipline, such as the introduction of risk based premiums, exclusion of certain deposit categories from the coverage, intensive supervision and regulation, and timely intervention and resolution of distressed institutions. Allowing insolvent financial institutions to fail and imposing costs on those that come close to failing can be the most effective way for the marketplace to discipline financial risk takers and limit moral hazard within the design of the safety net. A reasonable balance between moral hazard and a stable financial system would permit a very limited exception for failures that pose a systemic risk, while allowing the market to discipline improvident behavior. Thus, insolvent banks should in general be allowed to fail and shareholders should lose their equity if a bank is assisted to stay open. This proper balance between

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

2948

a stable financial system and moral hazard assures that, as a rule, the safety net will be a net through which insolvent institutions can fall and not a floor that prevents insolvent institutions from falling far enough to fail.

8. Steps taken to strengthen the Financial Safety Net and way forward

Currently, substantial measures are being taken by the CBSL to strengthen the financial safety net of Sri Lanka. It would be important to broaden CBSL’s regulatory powers and upgrade the resolution framework by setting up a special resolution regime for financial institutions, expanding resolution tools, improving deposit insurance, and enhancing emergency liquidity assistance. The finalisation and adoption of the new Banking (Special Provisions) Act would help in achieving these goals. Although larger and more sophisticated financial institutions should be subject to stricter regulatory and supervisory requirements, it is essential to maintain a level playing field for banks and LFCs that conduct essentially the same banking operations.

While the Central Bank Bill that has been submitted to the Parliament acknowledges the CBSL as the responsible authority for the resolution of financial institutions, the proposed Banking (Special Provisions) Act provides further details on the recovery and resolution planning process, triggers for resolution, and more importantly, the resolution powers that can be exercised by both CBSL and MOF. As a safety net measure, the resolution of a financial institution will ensure,

i. the stability of the financial system, including the payment, clearing, and settlement systems;

ii. continuity of critical functions of LBs;

iii. protection of public funds by minimising public financial support;

iv. protection for depositors of such banks; and

v. avoiding unnecessary destruction of the value of assets and seek to minimise losses to creditors and overall costs of resolution.

The maximum compensation amount payable per depositor per institution from SLDILSS has been increased from Rs.200,000 at the establishment of SLDILSS to Rs.1,100,000 by now. Accordingly, SLDILSS has been paying compensation to the insured depositors of six license cancelled/suspended finance companies, i.e., Central Investments and Finance PLC (CIFL), The Standard Credit Finance Ltd. (TSCFL), TKS Finance Ltd. (TKSFL), The Finance Company PLC (TFC), and ETI Finance Ltd. (ETIFL) and Swarnamahal Financial Services PLC (SFSP).

With the implementation of the proposed Banking (Special Provisions) Act, the legally instituted DIS would be available with an expanded mandate beyond the existing ‘pay box’ mandate. Further, the operational capability and payout readiness of DIS are being ensured through the implementation of the Depositor Wise Data Collection System, which is currently in the testing phase. The implementation of risk based premium system by DIS would ensure that financial institutions avoid excessive risk taking and reflect fairness in the payment of premiums. Further, the funding adequacy of DIS would be ensured through alternative funding sources, such as from international financial institutions, while funding contingencies would be addressed by entering into backup funding arrangements with the Government.

Additionally, a draft new ELA framework will be implemented in due course by the CBSL, which will consider avoiding any moral hazard from any of the financial safety net measures and ultimately avoiding negative impact on the CBSL balance sheet.

In order to ensure the stability of the financial system, and simultaneously reduce the cost of resolving bank failures, the CBSL must ensure that the proposed regulations and laws take adequate measures to prevent insolvent banks from keeping opened and to close failing banks early enough before their capital is depleted. This can be achieved by reducing CBSL discretion in discount-window lending, by permitting lending only to problem banks that are likely to survive liquidity problems and resolving financial institutions promptly.

Implementation of the Roadmap for Sustainable Finance in Sri Lanka

The Central Bank launched the Sri Lanka

Green Finance Taxonomy in May 2022 in

collaboration with relevant stakeholders. The

taxonomy provides a detailed classification of

economic activities that can be considered as

environmentally sustainable with the intention

of providing guidance to financial institutions in

mobilising funds for green/climate finance products

and services. The taxonomy was developed as a

part of implementing the Roadmap for Sustainable

Finance in Sri Lanka which was launched in 2019

based on the International Platform on Sustainable

Finance’s (IPSF) Common Ground Taxonomy

which harmonises both European and Chinese

taxonomies. The IFC extended financial and

technical assistance in developing the taxonomy

and a wide array of stakeholders including and not

limited to the Securities and Exchange Commission

(SEC), the Insurance Regulatory Commission of

Sri Lanka (IRCSL), the Ministry of Environment,

and the Ministry of Agriculture, participated in this

exercise.

During the year 2022, the Central Bank

engaged in numerous other measures aimed

at implementing the Roadmap for Sustainable

Finance in Sri Lanka. The Central Bank issued

a Direction for LCBs and a Guideline for LFCs in

2022, for facilitating sustainable finance activities in

line with the Sri Lanka Green Finance Taxonomy

considering the need for providing the financial sector

with a governance and risk management framework

for any such activities. Further, the Central Bank

engaged in the process of developing a Green Bond

Framework for the issuance of sovereign green bonds

initiated by the Ministry of Finance. United Nations

Economic and Social Commission for Asia and

Pacific (UNESCAP) provides technical assistance

in the development of the Green Bond Framework

which is also a regulatory action identified in the

Roadmap for Sustainable Finance in Sri Lanka for

the advancement of the capital markets. Moreover,

the Central Bank continues to work closely with

international agencies, including the United Nations

Development Programme (UNDP), IFC, UNESCAP

and other relevant stakeholder groups both locally

and globally in promoting sustainable financing

initiatives in the country.
