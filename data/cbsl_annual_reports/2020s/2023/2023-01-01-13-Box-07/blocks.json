    "text": "The external sector of Sri Lanka experienced heightened vulnerabilities with the decline in foreign exchange inflows due to unprecedented challenges in recent years, amidst the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and adverse developments in the global economy. The current account deficit widened due to the increased imports led by the normalisation of economic activities, moderation in tourism earnings and slowdown in workers\u2019 remittances. Downgrading of the sovereign credit ratings of the country constrained the access to global capital markets despite high debt servicing requirements, further aggravating the situation. In view of mounting imbalances in the external sector due to the lack of foreign exchange inflows, several measures were taken to improve foreign currency liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market and to replenish international reserves. These included establishing rules (Table B 7.1) mandating repatriation of export proceeds to the country within 180 days and conversion of such receipts into Sri Lanka rupees under the provisions of the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949 (MLA) in 2021, with a view to effectively enforcing such requirements.",

Having identified the importance of the exports, successive Governments in Sri Lanka have put in place policies that are conducive for building a vibrant exports sector. However, to obtain the maximum benefits of the export sector, a country needs to ensure that export proceeds are repatriated so that there would be no strain on the Balance of Payments. The requirement to repatriate export proceeds into Sri Lanka was initially imposed during 1973 under the repealed Exchange Control Act No. 24 of 1953 (ECA) and continued until 1993. This requirement for repatriation and surrender was liberalised subsequent to accepting Article VIII of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Articles of Agreement in 1994, as part of further liberalisation of current account transactions and continuation of the country\u2019s stabilisation programme. Accordingly, exporters were permitted to repatriate export proceeds and hold those in rupee or foreign currency accounts in Sri Lanka or retain them in foreign currency accounts in a bank abroad. However, the repatriation",

If the balance is sold to Authorised Dealers1 (ADs) in foreign exchange, such proceeds will be added to the domestic foreign exchange market increasing the liquidity. Similarly, inflows from other foreign exchange sources which are sold to ADs, such as workers\u2019 remittances, tourism earnings and foreign investments flows will also contribute to increase the domestic market liquidity. The banking system needs to accommodate various foreign exchange requirements of its customers, both of current and capital nature, for which the foreign currency so purchased will be utilised. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) may build up its reserves by purchasing foreign exchange from the domestic foreign exchange market. The major advantage of export proceeds is that they are non-debt creating inflows which exert no strain on the Balance of Payments.",
