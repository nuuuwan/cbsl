This is more important during economic shocks and stressful circumstances. However, throughout history, breach of trust in the banking system and depositor runs have caused significant negative impact on the economic activities across the globe, leading to systemic financial crises. Common causes of these systemic crises can be mainly identified as high leverage, booming credit, weakening of credit evaluation standards, lapses in governance and risk management, property and other asset bubbles, excessive exposure to the government, inadequate supervision, and often a high external current account deficit. As revealed by international examples such as the East Asian crisis (1997), GFC (2007-2008) and European crisis (2010), the financial distress resulting from a systemic crisis typically lasts for several years, largely resulting in considerable economic contractions and high fiscal costs, affecting the entire society.",
