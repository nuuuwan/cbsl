4.1 OverviewT

he general price level as measured by the official consumer price indices recorded an

unprecedented increase throughout 2022 owing to adverse supply shocks emanated from both

domestic and global fronts, sharp depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee against the US dollar and

lagged impact of monetary accommodation during the past few years. Nevertheless, the rate of increase

of price levels moderated towards the end of the year following the tight monetary policy stance pursued

by the Central Bank and easing of supply conditions. The decline in agriculture production caused by

the limited availability and high prices of inputs, and interruptions to the distribution network due to fuel

shortages led the prices of domestically produced food items to increase substantially. Meanwhile, the

increase in global commodity prices, high freight charges and most notably, the sharp depreciation

of the Sri Lanka rupee contributed to considerable upshifts in the prices of both imported Food and

Non-food items exerting significant upward pressure on the general price level. Moreover, the cost reflective

revisions to administered prices and upward revisions to value added tax (VAT) and the introduction

of the social security contribution levy (SSCL) also augmented the price increases in both Food and

Non-food categories. However, these adverse developments were mostly subsided towards the end of

the year with favourable developments in both the domestic and international markets. Continuation of

the tight monetary policy measures curtailed the demand driven inflationary pressures, while the improved

availability of inputs boosted domestic supply, thereby decelerating the pace of increase in the general

price level. The easing of commodity prices in the global market amidst the stability in the exchange rate

in response to the market guidance provided by the Central Bank for the interbank foreign exchange

market moderated the prices of imported commodities further lessening the pressure on the general price

level towards the latter part of the year. Reflecting these developments, headline inflation based on both

Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI, 2013=100) and National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100)

peaked in September 2022 and embarked on a disinflation path. The producer price inflation based on

the Producer Price Index (PPI, 2018 Q4=100) increased until August 2022 and declined towards the end

of the year. In terms of wages, increases in nominal wages were observed in formal and informal private

4.2 Prices

Movements in the General Price Level

The general price level, as measured by both

Consumer Price Indices (CPIs), namely, the

Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) and the

National Consumer Price Index (NCPI),1 moved

in a continuous increasing trend during 2022

exhibiting a sharp acceleration between March

and September 2022, yet moderated towards the

end of the year in line with subdued aggregate

demand pressures mainly resulted from tight

monetary policy measures and improvements

in supply conditions. Movements of prices of

items in both Food and Non-food categories were

perceptive to adverse economic conditions that

prevailed during 2022, i.e., substantial weakening

of the domestic agriculture sector, notable

depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee, insufficient

availability of foreign currency in the domestic

market, elevated commodity prices in the world

market, fuel shortages and higher fuel costs, and

higher freight charges. Meanwhile, adopting market

based pricing formulas for certain items, upward

price revisions to administered commodities, and

increases in various taxes also contributed towards

the increases in general price level. However,

upward pressure on food prices exerted by issues

related to limited availability of fertiliser moderated

to some extent owing to improvements in supply

1 The Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) compiles official consumer price indices, namely, the CCPI and the NCPI on a monthly basis. The CCPI demonstrates the price movements of selected consumer items in urban households in the Colombo district, while the NCPI reflects the same at the national level. Compilation of the CCPI (2013=100) and the NCPI (2013=100) were discontinued and replaced by CCPI (2021=100) and NCPI (2021=100) by the DCS since February 2023 and January 2023, respectively.

conditions, while the stabilisation of the exchange

rate observed with the Central Bank guidance for

the interbank foreign exchange market contributed

towards easing of prices of imported items in both

Food and Non-food categories towards the latter

part of 2022.

Prices of items in the Food category

increased sharply during January-September

2022 and followed a slight decreasing trend

afterwards. Meanwhile, prices of both Volatile

Food2 and other food items3 contributed to the

movement of the prices in the Food category during

2022. Increases observed in prices of domestically

produced food items were mainly attributed to low

supply conditions that arose due to the decline in

the 2021/2022 Maha harvest mainly led by the

limited availability and very high market prices of

chemical fertiliser. Later, although the Government

made attempts to adopt usual cultivating practices

using chemical fertiliser, it was unable to elevate

the Yala harvest to its usual yield. Meanwhile,

increases in transport costs driven by frequent

and substantial fuel price hikes and supply side

issues related to adverse weather conditions

also exerted considerable upward pressure on

domestic food prices. Prices of both local and

imported rice varieties increased substantially

until July 2022 necessitating the Government to

impose Maximum Retail Prices (MRPs) on local

rice varieties. Accordingly, MRPs were imposed on

local Samba and Nadu, at Rs. 230 per kg and Rs.

220 per kg, respectively, with effect from (w.e.f.)

sectors and the public sector during 2022. The nominal increases were due to the revision of minimum

wages of employees in the formal private sector, higher wages demanded by the informal private sector

amid the rising cost of living and the special allowance given for all public sector employees. However,

their real wages eroded due to a less than full adjustment of wages to rising prices averting a wage price

spiral in the economy.

Raw, at Rs. 210 per kg w.e.f. 10 June 2022.

Afterwards, a declining trend was observed in

the prices of local rice varieties, while the prices

of imported rice varieties also followed a similar

trend during the same period owing to low demand,

partly due to the free distribution of rice stocks

received by the Government as foreign donations

to low income families. Vegetable prices, which

exhibited a declining pattern in the early months of

2022, accelerated between April and June owing

to supply disruptions caused by fuel shortages,

higher transportation costs, adverse weather

conditions, and limited availability of fertiliser and

agrochemicals. Even though vegetable prices

remained elevated during the second half of the

year, they exhibited a slight decline between July

and September 2022. Meanwhile, the price of

chicken increased continuously during January

to October 2022, owing to the higher cost of

production, and shortage of poultry feed, minerals,

and medical supplements. Further, prices of

fresh fish, which were stable until April 2022

increased notably till September 2022 due to the

limited fishing activities caused by shortages and

elevated prices of fuel amid unfavourable weather

conditions. Afterwards, fish prices were subdued in

the last three months of the year partially supported

by the Government initiative to prioritise the supply

of kerosene to fishing activities. During 2022, egg

prices increased significantly due to the increased

cost of production. Meanwhile, in order to protect

consumers from the unreasonable escalation of

egg prices, an MRP of Rs. 43 per each was imposed

on white eggs w.e.f. 19 August 2022; yet the price

per egg increased continuously in the last quarter

of 2022 remaining around Rs. 50 partly caused by

festive demand.

Prices of imported food items were largely

affected by the shortage of foreign exchange,

increase in global commodity prices, higher

freight charges, and import restrictions

imposed considering the economic downturn.

It is noteworthy that the prices of imported food

items increased excessively in the domestic

market particularly with the float of the exchange

rate in March 2022. Meanwhile, higher commodity

prices in the world market led to elevated levels

of prices of essential imported food commodities,

such as sugar, dhal, big onion, dried chilli, and

potato during the year. A Special Commodity Levy

(SCL) of Rs. 20 per kg was imposed on imported

potato w.e.f. 15 June 2022, while the SCL of

Rs. 50 per kg imposed on big onion w.e.f.

23 September 2022 in order to safeguard local big

onion farmers was revised to Rs. 10 per kg w.e.f.

01 December 2022 after the local big onion season

ended. Moreover, prices of wheat flour, bread, and

milk powder were allowed to be determined by the

market forces leading to frequent upward price

revisions during 2022. Upward revisions to the price

of wheat flour resulted in an increase in the price of

a 450g loaf of bread from Rs. 80 at the beginning

of the year to a range of Rs. 140 - Rs. 200 by

December 2022. Meanwhile, other bakery products

also underwent several significant price revisions

in 2022 attributable to price increases in liquid

petroleum gas (LPG) and electricity in addition to

price increases observed in wheat flour. Moreover,

the price of a 400g imported milk powder packet

was revised upwards on four occasions, considering

the price increases in the global market and higher

freight charges. Further, the price of a 400g local milk

powder packet was also revised upwards in several

instances owing to the higher cost of production.

Although prices of dhal, white sugar, and dried fish

increased substantially during the first half of 2022,

their prices eased off during the latter part of the

year, mainly due to the reduction of prices of these

commodities in the global market. Moreover, the

policy measures taken to curtail the import demand

and stabilisation of the exchange rate moderated

and external economic downturns encountered

in 2022. Although prices of fuel (Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation (CPC)), LPG (Litro Gas Lanka Limited),

and bus fares were regulated by the Government,

prices of the same underwent several upward

revisions reflecting the current market prices

including the depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee.

Accordingly, prices of both petrol (92 Octane) and

Auto Diesel underwent several price revisions by

both CPC and Lanka Indian Oil Corporation (LIOC)

during the year. It is noteworthy that price revisions

on fuel made by both CPC and LIOC since

September 2022 were based on the new pricing

formula approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. In

response to fuel price hikes, fares of school vans,

taxies, and three wheelers also underwent upward

price revisions on several occasions in 2022.

However, bus fares were revised downwards

on two occasions by 2.23% and 11.14% w.e.f.

20 July 2022 and 05 August 2022, respectively,

following consecutive downward revisions in Auto

Diesel prices. Further, kerosene price underwent

two upward price revisions, recording a substantial

price increase during the year. The effects of

shortages and price hikes in fuel were transmitted to

and visible in each and every sector of the economy.

It is noteworthy that train fares underwent an

upward price revision nearly after four years w.e.f.

25 July 2022. Moreover, reflecting the impact

of the rupee depreciation and import restriction

measures on non-essential imports, prices of

vehicle spare parts, and vehicle servicing costs

increased considerably during the period under

review. The price of an LPG cylinder weighing

12.5kg was revised on several occasions,

impelling an overall increase in prepared

food items in 2022. Electricity tariffs, which

remained unchanged for nearly eight years, were

increased substantially by 75% on average w.e.f.

10 August 2022 in order to offset its generation

cost and distribution cost. In addition, water

tariffs, which had not been revised for nearly

10 years, underwent a notable upward revision w.e.f.

01 September 2022. Household maintenance and

equipment recorded a continuous price increase

during 2022 mainly due to rupee depreciation, global

commodity price hikes, elevated transportation

costs, and limited availability of such goods

originated due to import restrictions. Moreover,

housing rent recorded only a marginal increase in

April 2022 partly due to the diminishing purchasing

power of the tenants. Health related expenses

included in the respective consumer baskets, such

as private medical practice fees, and payments to

private hospitals increased substantially during the

year. Furthermore, the telecommunication levy,

which stood at 11.25%, was increased to 15%

w.e.f. 01 June 2022. Moreover, value added tax

(VAT) was revised upwards from 8% to 12%

w.e.f. 01 June 2022 and to 15% w.e.f. 01 September

2022, while the introduction of SSCL also contributing

to escalate prices of items in the Non-food category

further. The practice of maintaining prices of several

key imported items, such as fuel, LPG, and prices

of essential services, such as electricity and water,

bus and train fares, telecommunication, and postal

charges at stable levels by the Government without

major upward revisions as a relief measure to the

public, became almost impossible under the current

economic conditions. If gradual revisions of prices

related to administered goods and services had

been done over the years in accordance with global

price fluctuations and movement in the exchange

rate without artificially controlling their prices at lower

levels, the impact of the drastic upward revisions that

occurred during 2022 could have been mitigated

with passing a lesser burden to the consumers. It is

also noteworthy that when granting price subsidies,

the Government should properly consider the

strengths and weaknesses of all segments of the

economy without obstructing the medium and long

term economic revival of the country.

National Consumer Price Index (NCPI)

The NCPI (2013=100), which recorded 166.0

index points in January 2022, reached 256.3

index points in December 2022. In line with

the CCPI, movements in prices of both Food and

Non-food categories contributed towards the

monthly increases observed in the NCPI during

January-September of 2022. However, the monthly

increase observed in October 2022 was solely driven

by the increases observed in the prices of items

in the Non-food category. Meanwhile, the decline

observed in the monthly change in the following

month was due to decreases observed in the prices

of items in the Food category. The NCPI remained

unchanged in December 2022 from November

as the monthly price increase observed in the

Non-food category was negated by the monthly

price decrease in the Food category. It is noteworthy

that the highest monthly increases in both Food

and Non-food categories since the initiation of the

NCPI were recorded at 14.2% in June and 8.6% in

May 2022, respectively. Accordingly, the headline

inflation, as measured by the year-on-year (Y-o-Y)

change in the NCPI (2013=100) rose continuously

from 16.8% in January 2022 to 73.7% in September

2022 and declined afterwards to reach 59.2% in

December 2022.

Consumer Price Indices

Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI)

The CCPI (2013=100) increased from 158.4

index points in January 2022 to 243.2 index

points in December 2022. The accelerated pace

observed in the movement of the CCPI during

the period from January to September 2022 was

attributed to monthly price increases observed in

both Food and Non-food categories, with a higher

contribution originating from the Non-food category

except for June 2022. Monthly declines were

observed in the CCPI in October and November for

which the major contributor was the Food category.

The highest monthly change in the CCPI was

recorded at 12.8% in June 2022, along with the

highest monthly increases of 18.9% and 9.4% in the

Food and Non-food categories, respectively, since

the introduction of the CCPI series. Accordingly,

the headline inflation, as measured by the

year-on-year (Y-o-Y) change in the CCPI

(2013=100) rose continuously from 14.2% in

January 2022 to peak at 69.8% in September

2022, the highest recorded in the history. However,

it pivoted towards the envisaged disinflation path in

October 2022, reaching 57.2% in December 2022.

The Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), the compiler of official Consumer Price Indices (CPIs) in Sri Lanka updated the base year of official CPIs from the base year of 2013 to 2021. Rebasing of CPIs at regular intervals in line with international standards and best practices is essential to reflect contemporary consumer spending patterns in a more accurate manner. Rebasing leads to upgrades of main features of the CPIs especially the weight structure, which indicates the prominence or the representativeness of goods and services in the basket of goods and services. Further, the composition of the basket would also get revised with addition of new items and removal of existing items based on the significance of latest consumption patterns.

The DCS released rebased CPIs (2021=100), i.e., National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) and Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) from February 2023. The CCPI which was introduced with the base year of 1952 was rebased four times resulting CCPI series with the base years, 1952, 2002, 2006/07, 2013 and 2021, while for the NCPI, 2021 is the second series after its first series with the base year 2013. The methodology of the index calculation was updated with the rebasing, where CPIs (2021=100) are now calculated in two stages. In the initial stage, elementary indices are compiled, while higher level indices are compiled at the second stage. Elementary indices are compiled using the geometric mean or the Jevons Formula, while the higher level

BOX 6Rebasing of Consumer Price Indices to Base Year 2021

indices are compiled using the Young Formula. The weight structure of both CPIs is based on the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) conducted by the DCS in 2019, which comprised of all types of consumption expenditure incurred by a household. Accordingly, the weight reference year of both CCPI (2021=100) and NCPI (2021=100) is 2019. Further, prices reported during the period from January 2018 to December 2019 were used as the price reference in the calculation of indices. The index reference period which is the period where the index was equaled to 100, is 2021. The key features of the official price indices are given in Table B 6.1.

A significant change observed in the weight structure of both CPIs with the rebasing is that the weight of Food category decreased while that of Non-food category increased. Accordingly, the weight of the Food category in the CCPI decreased to 26.23 per cent from 28.24 per cent, while the weight of the Food category in the NCPI decreased to 39.22 per cent from 44.04 per cent with the rebasing process. In rebasing, items such as bread (special), dambala (winged beans), and watermelon were added to the Food category, while items such as fresh sprats, crabs, and sesame oil were removed. Meanwhile, the weight of the Non-food category in the CCPI and the NCPI increased to 73.77 per cent from 71.76 per cent and to 60.78 per cent from 55.96 per cent respectively. With the rebasing,

items such as tables, and tailoring charges for clothing were added to the Non-food category, while items such as cigars, steel almirahs and dry cell batteries were removed. It is noteworthy that Housing, Water, Electricity and Other Fuels, Food and Non Alcoholic Beverages, and Transport sub-categories continued to remain as the topmost categories in terms of their expenditure value with the rebasing of both the CCPI and NCPI.

In terms of both the CPIs the index overlapping period is between January 2022 and December 2022. Accordingly, the comparison of month-on-month percentage changes of both the CPIs with their current and previous base periods are shown in Figures B 6.3 and B 6.4. As per these figures, the variations between

the base years are largely minimal owing to the slight differences in the weight structure and the composition of the basket of goods and services under the two bases. Nevertheless, it is imperative to rebase CPIs on the specific time intervals to ensure that the prevailing consumption patterns are reflected accurately as CPIs plays a crucial role in the economic decision making processes of various economic agencies.

Producer Price Index (PPI)

The PPI (2018 Q4=100), as measured by

the average prices received by the domestic

producers of goods, which is compiled by the

DCS, exhibited an overall increasing trend

during 2022 from 137.4 index points in January

2022 to 251.4 index points in December 2022.

The PPI moved at an accelerated pace during the

period from February to August, mainly contributed by

the Manufacturing subsector which had the highest

weight yet stabilised during the remainder of 2022.

The Agriculture subsector in the PPI, which recorded

164.1 index points in January 2022, increased

exponentially during the first half of the year and

remained stable afterwards reaching 238.6 index

points in December 2022. Meanwhile, the PPI in

the Manufacturing subsector reported 135.3 and

257.0 index points in January and December 2022,

respectively, recording monthly declines only in

September and November 2022. The PPI in the

Utility (Electricity, Gas, Steam and Air conditioning

supply and Water collection, treatment and supply)

subsector, which was recorded at 103.3 index points

in January 2022, increased notably in August and

September owing to upward revisions in electricity

and water tariffs, reaching 174.2 index points in

December 2022. The producer price inflation based

on the Producer Price Index (PPI, 2018 Q4=100)

increased until August 2022 and declined towards

the end of the year reaching 89.0% in December

2022.

4.3 Wages

Real wages of employees in the formal and

informal private sectors and public sector

eroded due to less than full wage adjustment

to rising prices, while the nominal wages of

employees in all sectors increased in 2022

compared to the previous year. The increase

in nominal wages of the employees in the informal

private sector was mainly attributed to the demand

for higher wages due to the significant rise in the

cost of living, while paying a special allowance of

Rs. 5,000 for all employees of the public sector had

a positive impact on the increase in nominal wages

of public sector employees.

Private Sector Wages

Nominal wages of informal private sector

employees, as measured by the informal private

sector wage rate index (2018=100), exhibited an

overall increasing trend in 2022. Accordingly, the

informal private sector wage rate index (2018=100),

increased significantly in nominal terms by 24.5% in

2022, compared to the increase of 9.2% in 2021.

In terms of the sub-activities, namely, agriculture,

industry, and services, the informal private sector

wage rate index increased in nominal terms by

27.6%, 22.4% and 26.4%, respectively, in 2022

compared to the previous year. The nominal wage

rate index recorded monthly increases during 2022

except for November 2022. These increases were

mainly attributed to wage demands by daily wage

earners owing to the sharp increase in the cost of

living during the year. The decline recorded in

November was mainly due to the decreases

observed in both industry (manufacturing and

construction) and services (wholesale and retail

trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles;

accommodation and food service activities; and

hair dressing and other beauty treatments) related

activities. Moreover, in 2022, labour demand

and supply side negotiations played a vital role

in deciding informal sector daily wages due to

constraints that prevailed during the year such

as significant contraction of economic activity,

consumers prioritising some needs considering

individual payment capacity over certain

dispensable activities, and reduced working hours

due to supply shortages in utilities, such as LPG,

fuel, and electricity. In addition, some activities such

as brick making, other cement article making and

bakery/restaurant activities were halted temporarily

due to the unavailability of raw materials such as

cement, wheat flour, etc. affecting the livelihood of

many informal private sector workers. Overall, due

to the high inflationary environment, informal private

sector employees experienced a real wage erosion

of 15.7% in 2022, compared to the previous year.

Nominal wages of the employees in the

formal private sector,4 as measured by the

minimum wage rate index (1978 December=100)

of employees, whose wages are governed by

wage boards, recorded slight increases in 2022.

4 Nominal wages of formal private sector employees, whose wages are governed by the wage boards are measured by the minimum wage rate index (1978 December = 100) compiled by the Department of Labour.

The nominal wage rate index increased by 9.8%

in 2022 compared to the previous year mainly due

to the statistical effect of the lower base prevailed

in early 2021. It is noteworthy that the minimum

daily wage of tea and rubber plantation workers

increased to Rs. 1,000 w.e.f. 05 March 2021 through

respective wage boards for tea and rubber growing

and manufacturing trade. Further, the minimum

monthly salary of the private sector was increased

from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 12,500 and the minimum

daily wage was increased from Rs. 400 to Rs. 500

with the amendment introduced to the National

Minimum Wage of Workers Act, No. 3 of 2016

w.e.f. 16 August 2021. Meanwhile, the real wage

rate index of the formal private sector decreased by

22.7% in 2022 compared to 2021 mainly due to the

high inflationary environment that prevailed in 2022.

Public Sector Wages

Payment of the special allowance of

Rs. 5,000 for all public sector employees was

initiated at the beginning of 2022 by the Ministry

of Finance as a relief measure to the rising cost

of living. Moreover, the salary anomalies of school

principals and teachers were removed through

upward revisions made to their salaries in January

2022. Consequently, nominal wages of the public

sector employees, as measured by the public sector

wage rate index (2016=100), increased after two

years in January 2022, and remained unchanged

thereafter. Accordingly, the public sector wage

rate index (2016=100) increased in nominal terms

by 16.1% in 2022 compared to the previous year.

However, due to the developments in inflation,

public sector employees experienced a real wage

erosion of 20.6% in 2022 compared to 2021.
