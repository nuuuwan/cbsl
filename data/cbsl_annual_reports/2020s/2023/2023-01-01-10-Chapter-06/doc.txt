6.1 OverviewF

iscal sector imbalances that persisted for several decades reached a tipping point in 2022, resulting in a myriad of socio-economic stresses with unprecedented political ramifications. The public debt reached an unsustainable level, due to perpetual budget deficits and significant fiscal slippages in recent years amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and policy missteps, despite limitations enshrined in the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, No. 3 of 2003 and its amendments as well as the Active Liability Management Act, No. 8 of 2018. Falling government revenue and rising debt service obligations over the years heightened the country’s vulnerabilities to domestic and global economic shocks. A series of sovereign credit rating downgrades by international rating agencies that started in January 2020 and intensified during the second half of 2021 through early 2022 posed a formidable challenge for the Government in mobilising foreign financing required for servicing foreign debt. Lack of access to foreign financing and the depletion of usable official reserves to near-zero levels in early 2022 constrained foreign debt servicing by the Government. Consequently, the Government announced a temporary suspension of selected foreign debt service payments, on 12 April 2022. The Government had already sought assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) in March 2022. However, no progress was made on negotiating an EFF as Sri Lanka’s public debt has reached unsustainable level, warranting measures to initiate debt restructuring, following the announcement of the debt standstill. Subsequently, a staff level agreement was reached in early September 2022, and upon securing the financing assurances from the bilateral creditors, the Executive Board of the IMF approved the EFF budget support programme in March 2023. In the recent years, the Government was compelled to rely on domestic sources for deficit financing, and for a large part, monetary financing, which surged during 2021 and persisted through 2022, resulting in significant inflationary pressures. This warranted significant monetary policy tightening in early 2022 to stem burgeoning inflation, resulting in an upward adjustment of yields on government securities, which were heavily affected subsequently by rising uncertainties about the restructuring of domestic debt of the Government. As fiscal sector pressures mounted during 2022, the Government was compelled to frontload unparalleled fiscal reforms and policy measures aimed at regaining confidence and stability with significant adjustment costs in the near term. The Government embarked on a strong fiscal consolidation path, primarily revenue based, along with the commissioning of cost reflective pricing strategies for utilities provided by major State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs). However, government expenditure continued to rise despite some expenditure rationalisation measures implemented during 2022. This increase of government expenditure in nominal terms mainly reflected the large interest payments on ballooning domestic debt, and the significant increase of lending to State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and expenditure on subsidies and transfers. Nevertheless, the

fiscal consolidation measures, along with the expansion of nominal GDP with a high deflator helped the

Government to contain the deficits in main fiscal balances, in GDP terms, during 2022. The primary deficit

narrowed, both in nominal terms as well as in GDP terms, compared to 2021, and a further improvement in

the primary balance is warranted in the period ahead to ensure public debt sustainability. Government revenue

is expected to increase in 2023, reflecting the full benefit of measures introduced in late 2022, including the

expansion of Value Added Tax (VAT) and personal income tax bases and the increase of personal and corporate

income tax rates. Sri Lanka is expected to complete the debt restructuring process in 2023 and bring the trajectory

of public debt in line with the debt sustainability targets under the IMF-EFF arrangement over the medium to long

term. With the continued efforts on revenue enhancement and expenditure rationalisation, a surplus in the primary

balance is projected from 2024, thereby ensuring medium to long term public debt sustainability. In particular,

expenditure cuts by the Government on non-essential and non-urgent activities would be an absolute necessity

for successful completion of the IMF-EFF budget support programme. Concerted efforts of all stakeholders and

the support of the public are imperative in the forthcoming period in order to ensure that the envisaged fiscal

consolidation path is realised by committing to an expeditious implementation of reforms, including those of

SOBEs. The realisation of fiscal consolidation is vital to ensure sustained recovery and stability of the economy

and protect the vulnerable groups of society in the period ahead.

measures, providing further budgetary allocations

on essential activities for which initial allocations

remained inadequate, and making budgetary

allocations in line with the changes to the structure

of Ministries. As per the Interim Budget 2022, the

government revenue to GDP target for the year

was revised to 8.8 per cent, while envisaging lower

expenditure and overall fiscal deficit of 18.6 per cent

and 9.8 per cent of GDP, respectively. Accordingly,

the primary deficit target for 2022 was revised to

4.0 per cent of GDP.

Several revenue enhancement measures

were introduced in 2022 with the aim of

reversing the declining trend in tax revenue

of the Government and addressing structural

weaknesses in government revenue collection.

As per the Budget 2022, the Government imposed

a retrospective one-off surcharge tax of 25 per cent

on individuals, companies, and partnerships whose

taxable income for the 2020/2021 tax assessment

year exceeded Rs. 2.0 billion. Meanwhile, VAT on

financial services was increased from 15 per cent

to 18 per cent with effect from January 2022.

Meanwhile, the VAT rate was increased from

6.2 Fiscal Policy Measures

The Government initiated significant

reforms in 2022 aimed at fiscal consolidation

and debt sustainability, assisted mainly by the

IMF-EFF budget support programme, among

others. The Budget 2022 proposed ambitious

targets for government revenue and expenditure,

as a percentage of GDP, of 12.0 per cent and

20.8 per cent, respectively. However, these targets

became challenging due to lacklustre revenue

collection in the first half of the year reflecting the

impact of disruption to economic activity and

expenditure overruns amidst large domestic interest

payments caused by the substantial increase in

domestic borrowing at elevated interest rates,

which were affected by the high risk premia due

to debt restructuring concerns. The Government

announced expenditure rationalisation measures in

March and April 2022, while the Cabinet of Ministers

approved several revenue enhancement measures

in May 2022. In September 2022, the Parliament

approved the Interim Budget 2022, which was

aimed at reinforcing revenue enhancement

8 per cent to 12 per cent and the Telecommunication

Levy was raised from 11.25 per cent to

15 per cent with effect from June 2022. The general

VAT rate was further increased from 12 per cent

to 15 per cent effective from 01 September 2022,

as proposed by the Interim Budget 2022. With

the enactment of Value Added Tax (Amendment)

Act, No. 44 of 2022 on 15 December 2022,

the threshold turnover per annum for VAT

registration was brought down to Rs. 80.0 million

from Rs. 300.0 million with effect from 01 October

2022, thereby broadening the tax base. In addition,

effective from 01 October 2022, a Social Security

Contribution Levy of 2.5 per cent on turnover was

imposed on importers, manufacturers, service

providers, wholesalers, and retailers, whose annual

turnover exceeds Rs. 120.0 million. Moreover, the

Government introduced a surcharge on selected

imported items for a period of six months with effect

from 01 June 2022 in consideration of sparse liquidity

in the domestic foreign exchange market and the

issues related to granting import licenses. Although

legislative amendments were made to the income

tax structure, including measures in the Inland

Revenue (Amendment) Bill to amend the Inland

Revenue Act, No. 24 of 2017, these amendments

were effective from January 2023. Since a majority

of the revenue enhancement measures that were

introduced in 2022 became effective from the

second half of 2022 and beginning of 2023, the full

impact on government revenue from such measures

is expected from 2023 onwards.

Despite the limited fiscal space, the

Government initiated measures to help the

vulnerable segments of the society amidst

significant socio-economic stresses. In

January 2022, the Government announced a

relief package to support public sector employees,

pensioners, and low income earners to ease the

immediate financial strain caused by the economic

crisis. Accordingly, public sector employees and

pensioners were paid a monthly allowance of

Rs. 5,000, and the monthly allowance for Samurdhi

beneficiaries was raised by Rs. 1,000 per family.

Considering the escalation of government

expenditure over the budgetary allocations, the

Parliament approved a supplementary allocation

of Rs. 695.0 billion in June 2022 (2.9 per cent of

GDP) to carry on the relief package introduced

in January 2022 and to allocate funds for other

expenditure. In view of unprecedented hardships

caused by the economic crisis, the World Bank and

Asian Development Bank (ADB) repurposed some

of their existing project funding to the Government to

support affected communities. These funds were

used for numerous activities, including the

provisioning of cash grants to poor and vulnerable

groups, provisioning of fertiliser for agricultural

activities, purchasing of essential medicines, and

purchasing of Liquified Petroleum (LP) gas and

distributing LP gas cylinders in urban and semi

urban areas.

In view of the widening budget deficit

and limited budgetary financing avenues

for the Government, several expenditure

rationalisation measures were introduced

since March 2022. Accordingly, the Ministry

of Finance, Economic Stabilisation and

National Policies (MOF) issued a circular

instructing government institutions to suspend

non-essential, non-urgent capital expenditure,

restrict recurrent expenditure on overtime

payments, loans granted to public sector

employees, and stationery and printing costs,

etc., while freezing new recruitments to the public

sector. Moreover, a similar circular was issued in

August 2022, instructing to curtail expenditure of

commercial corporations, statutory boards, and

government owned companies. In consideration

of the energy crisis faced by the country and

FISCAL POLICY AND GOVERNMENT FINANCE

increasing government expenditure, in March

2022, the Ministry of Public Services, Provincial

Councils, and Local Government issued a circular

instructing to reduce expenditure on fuel and

electricity of these institutions.

After a long hiatus in regular electricity tariff

and fuel price adjustments, the Government

revised retail petroleum prices and end

consumer electricity tariffs to a cost recovery

level several times, in view of persistent

financial losses of Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation (CPC) and Ceylon Electricity

Board (CEB). The Government adjusted retail

fuel prices from June 2022 onwards on a monthly

basis and the Cabinet of Ministers approved the

use of 2018 fuel pricing formula to determine

retail prices. Meanwhile, the electricity tariffs were

upwardly adjusted in August 2022 and February

2023. Further, in November 2022, the Cabinet of

Ministers approved to adjust electricity tariffs to

cost recovery levels in January and July every

year. In future, Bulk Supply Transaction Account

(BSTA) would be improved to determine cost

recovery based electricity tariffs, electricity

subsidy and budget transfers to the CEB in

relation to the electricity subsidy. Cost reflective

price adjustments are expected to strengthen

the financial performance of the CEB and CPC,

thereby minimising the potential fiscal burden that

arises from contingent liabilities.

The gross borrowing limit for 2022 was

revised several times in consideration of the

large budget deficit and gross financing needs

in nominal terms, thereby creating additional

space for domestic financing amidst limited

foreign financing. A gross borrowing limit of

Rs. 3,200 billion for the year 2022 was approved

under the Appropriation Act, No. 30 of 2021.

In early September 2022, this limit was revised

upward to Rs. 3,844 billion by the Appropriation

(Amendment) Act, No. 21 of 2022 in view of the

increased expenses on essential activities, over the

existing allocations provided in the Budget 2022 as

well as increased domestic debt service payments.

Moreover, in November 2022, the Parliament

granted approval to further raise the gross

borrowing limit for 2022 by another Rs. 663 billion

to Rs. 4,507 billion in order to meet the Government’s

soaring funding requirement amidst elevated

interest rates. Meanwhile, the Parliament approved

an increase in the limit of outstanding Treasury bills

from Rs. 3,000 billion to Rs. 4,000 billion in June

2022. This limit was further raised to Rs. 5,000

billion in November 2022, with a Parliamentary

approval, in consideration of the rising borrowing

requirement in face value terms due to high market

interest rates.

Given the limited access to foreign financing

amidst the debt standstill and the series

of sovereign credit rating downgrades, the

Government opted for a reverse graduation for

Sri Lanka for a limited time period in relation

to funding from International Development

Association (IDA), with the aim of accessing

concessional foreign financing. Sri Lanka

no longer qualified for loans granted by the

International Bank for Reconstruction and

Development (IBRD) owing to the lower sovereign

credit ratings. Therefore, in October 2022, the

Cabinet of Ministers approved a request to be

made to the World Bank for funding from the IDA,

which provides concessional financing to highly

vulnerable countries through its ‘Gap’ facility.

Accordingly, the World Bank approved Sri Lanka’s

request for IDA funding in December 2022,

enabling the country to implement a

macroeconomic stabilisation programme while

protecting the vulnerable groups.

On 12 April 2022, the Government

announced a debt standstill, as an interim

measure, for identified categories of external

public debt, in view of impending large foreign

debt service payments of the Government with

depleted gross official reserves and limited

foreign exchange inflows to the country.

Simultaneously, the Government announced its

intention to restructure its foreign bilateral and

commercial debt. The Government sought

assistance from the IMF for an EFF arrangement,

which required efforts to ensure debt sustainability

through a debt restructuring process. Accordingly,

the Lazard Frères SAS and Clifford Chance LLP

were appointed as the financial and legal advisors,

respectively, to facilitate the debt restructuring

process of the Government. In tandem with the

EFF supported programme and debt restructuring

efforts, a comprehensive macroeconomic reform

agenda was implemented to ensure debt and

fiscal sector sustainability in the near to long term.

This macroeconomic programme encompasses

a strong fiscal consolidation process besides

the institutional reforms to SOEs including

establishing of cost reflective pricing mechanisms

for the provisioning of utilities. In this regard, the

Sri Lankan Government and the IMF entered into

a Staff Level Agreement in early September 2022

for a budget support EFF arrangement. All key

bilateral creditors, including Paris Club member

countries, India and China, gave their financing

assurances for the debt restructuring process to

a level accepted by the IMF. Subsequently, the

Executive Board of the IMF approved SDR 2.286

billion (around US dollars 3 billion) under the EFF

for Sri Lanka on 20 March 2023. With the approval

of the EFF, the debt restructuring negotiations

with the bilateral and commercial creditors are

expected to be completed during 2023.

Sri Lanka's sovereign credit ratings, which

had been downgraded in recent years, were

subjected to further downgrade in 2022 following

the preemptive default of selected foreign debt

service payments. Accordingly, S&P Global Ratings

downgraded Sri Lanka’s sovereign credit rating from

‘CCC (Negative)’ to ‘CC (Negative)’ on 13 April

2022, and ‘SD’ (Selective Default) on 25 April 2022

owing to the non-payment of International Sovereign

Bond (ISB) coupons in April 2022. Further, on 18

April 2022, Moody’s Investor Service downgraded

Sri Lanka’s sovereign credit rating to ‘Ca (Stable)’

from ‘Caa2 (Stable)’. Fitch Ratings downgraded the

country’s long term foreign currency Issuer Default

Rating (IDR) from ‘C’ to ‘RD’ (Restricted Default) on

19 May 2022. Moreover, on 01 December 2022, long

term local currency IDR was downgraded from ‘CCC’

to ‘CC’ by Fitch Ratings in view of the probable ‘local

currency debt default’.

Several debt obligations of SOBEs were

reclassified as central government debt by

end 2022, resulting in an escalation in central

government debt. In January 2023, the Cabinet

of Ministers approved the absorption of eight loans

to the central government debt that were obtained

from the Export-Import Bank of China (EXIM Bank

of China) and were recorded as SOBE loans.

These loans, which were previously classified

under the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), CEB,

and Airport and Aviation Services Ltd. (AASL),

amounted to US dollars 1,427.3 million at end

2022, and had been obtained in relation to

Hambantota port, Norochcholai coal powerplant,

and Mattala airport. In addition, several foreign

currency debt obligations of the CPC amounting

to US dollars 2,434.8 million were also reclassified

under central government debt.

As part of the comprehensive economic

reform programme to address macroeconomic

imbalances and restore public debt

sustainability, the Government undertook

several bold measures to reinforce its

commitment towards the fiscal consolidation

path. The Cabinet of Ministers granted

approval to reduce 6 per cent of the approved

recurrent expenditure estimates of all government

institutions for 2023. Accordingly, the MOF issued

a circular to all ministries, departments, provincial

councils, district secretariats, state corporations,

statutory boards, and government owned

companies to cutdown 6 per cent of their recurrent

expenditure, other than essential expenses,

such as salaries, retirement benefits, medicines,

rents and local taxes, interest payments, and

mandatory welfare benefit payments. Moreover,

with the aim of enhancing the progressivity of the

tax structure by raising the direct tax to overall

tax ratio, the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act,

No. 45 of 2022 was approved by the Parliament

in December 2022 revising the income tax

structures for both individuals and corporates.

These legislative amendments, inter alia, included

revision of the tax-free threshold for personal

income taxes to Rs.1.2 million per annum from

Rs. 3.0 million; removal of expenditure relief of

Rs. 1.2 million granted for expenditure incurred

on account of education, health, interest paid

on housing loans, contributions to pension

scheme, etc.; increase in personal income

tax rates upward to 6 per cent, 12 per cent,

18 per cent, 24 per cent, 30 per cent, and

36 per cent compared to previous 6 per cent,

12 per cent, and 18 per cent; revision of tax

brackets to Rs. 0.5 million for the income above

Rs. 1.2 million tax free threshold; reintroduction of

the mandatory Pay As You Earn (PAYE) system;

and upward revision of corporate income tax rate to

30 per cent, while removing sector specific corporate

income tax exemptions and concessionary rates

granted for companies. Meanwhile, the Government

increased the excise duty on cigarettes, alcoholic

and petroleum products, effective from January

2023. Moreover, the Government revised the Ports

and Airports Development Levy (PAL) for several

imported items. Although efforts have been made

thus far to expand the tax base, the Government

needs to focus on improving the tax administration

to further expand the tax base by minimising tax

evasions, enabling the Government to raise revenue

without imposing a substantial burden on those

who are already in the tax net. Given the reduction

of earned incomes due to economic downturn and

the high rate of migration of the potential taxpayers,

achieving the expected personal and corporate

income tax revenue targets by the Inland Revenue

Department (IRD) would be challenging in the near

term. The IRD, with the support of the judiciary,

should therefore expedite settlements on pending

tax cases as well as conclude legal action on tax

fraudsters and tax evaders to fill in these revenue

gaps.

The Government needs to remain committed

to implementing fiscal consolidation measures

and implementing reforms under the IMF-EFF

supported programme with the aim of ensuring

long term fiscal sustainability to promote

sustainable economic growth and enhance

the country’s economic resilience. While

demonstrating the Government’s commitment to

addressing economic imbalances and paving the

FISCAL POLICY AND GOVERNMENT FINANCE

way for the successful implementation of the IMF

programme, the Government met all prior actions

before the approval of the EFF arrangement by the

IMF Executive Board. These actions included the

approval of the Cabinet of Ministers for revenue

enhancement measures, Parliamentary approval

for the Interim Budget 2022, submission of the

Appropriation Bill for 2023 to the Parliament in

accordance with the EFF supported programme

parameters, the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers

to automate monthly retail fuel price adjustments on

cost recovery basis, and to automate semi annual

electricity price adjustment on cost recovery basis. In

addition, several quantitative performance criteria,

indicative targets and structural benchmarks are

stipulated under the IMF-EFF arrangement to be

achieved within a specific timeline. The quantitative

performance criteria include targets on primary

balance and stock of expenditure arrears of the

Government, for which the country’s performance

will be measured against the target at each biannual

review of the programme by the IMF. Accordingly,

the primary deficit target of 0.7 per cent of GDP

is to be achieved for 2023, while expenditure

arrears should be fully settled by June 2023 without

accruing any arrears afterwards. In addition, the

IMF-EFF supported programme has also set

indicative targets in terms of government revenue,

social spending by the central government, cost of

non commercial obligations for fuel and electricity

and a ceiling for treasury guarantees. Meanwhile,

structural benchmarks, inter alia, include retail

fuel price revisions to the cost recovery level on

a monthly basis, electricity tariff revisions to cost

recovery levels on a biannual basis, improvement

of the bulk supply transaction account to determine

cost recovery based electricity tariffs, Parliamentary

approval for the welfare benefit payment scheme

and the use of new eligibility criteria to identify

beneficiaries of these schemes, approval of the

Cabinet of Ministers for a comprehensive strategy

to restructure the balance sheets of CEB, CPC,

SriLankan Airlines (SLA), and Road Development

Authority, completion of the rollout of the Integrated

Treasury Management Information System (ITMIS)

and expansion of its coverage, approval of the

Cabinet of Ministers for the revenue enhancement

measures for 2024, submission of the Appropriation

Act and approval of Budget 2024 by the Parliament

in line with the programme parameters, and

submission of a new Public Financial Management

Bill to the Parliament. Meeting these structural

benchmarks within the stipulated timeline will

be crucial for the continuation of the IMF-EFF

supported programme. Implemention of these

structural reforms would be paramount to achieve

fiscal sustainability in the period ahead, while

addressing longstanding issues of the SOEs that

emanated economic vulnerabilities.

6.3 Government Budgetary Operations

Revenue and Grants

Revenue

Government revenue and grants improved

in 2022 in nominal terms, owing to the

revenue based fiscal consolidation measures

implemented during the year along with the

sharp increase in the price level. In nominal

terms, government revenue grew by 35.8 per cent

in 2022, compared to 2021, reflecting higher tax

and non tax revenue collections. Tax revenue

increased by 34.9 per cent in 2022 benefitting

from the increased revenue mobilisation from

income taxes, VAT, PAL, and the excise duties

on liquor and cigarettes. Meanwhile, the rise in

revenue collection from all the subcategories

of non tax revenue, except profit and dividend,

resulted in an increase of 43.4 per cent in non tax

revenue during the year. Most revenue enhancing

measures initiated during the year were

implemented in the second half of 2022 and

early 2023. As a result, the government

revenue, as a percentage of GDP, recorded a

marginal decline due to the notable growth in

nominal GDP. Grants grew by 395.7 per cent to

Rs. 33.4 billion in 2022, compared to 2021.

Accordingly, government revenue and grants, as

a percentage of GDP, remained unchanged in

2022, compared to the preceding year.

The increase in government revenue

can be primarily attributed to the growth in

income tax collection, which was driven by the

retrospective one-off surcharge tax collection.

Revenue from income taxes recorded a

year-on-year growth of 76.8 per cent, in nominal

terms, mainly due to the surcharge tax, which

accounted for more than one fifth of total income

tax mobilised during the year. Accordingly, revenue

from income taxes, as a percentage of GDP,

increased from 1.7 per cent in 2021 to 2.2 per cent

in 2022. Consequently, the share of direct tax

revenue in the total tax revenue collection improved

to 30.5 per cent in 2022 over 23.3 per cent

recorded in 2021. Revenue from corporate and

non corporate income taxes, which includes

the surcharge tax, increased significantly by

78.5 per cent to Rs. 488.4 billion in 2022 in

comparison to Rs. 273.6 billion recorded in 2021.

Revenue from surcharge tax, which was collected

in two instalments in April and July 2022, amounted

to Rs. 120.7 billion. Meanwhile, revenue from

Advance Personal Income Tax (APIT) and

Withholding Tax (WHT) also increased in 2022 by

Rs. 10.2 billion and Rs. 7.4 billion, respectively, to

Rs. 25.5 billion and Rs. 19.8 billion, respectively,

compared to 2021, due to improved tax

administration in 2022, compared to 2021 when

revenue collection activities were hampered by

the pandemic. The arrears collected on Economic

Service Charge (ESC), which was abolished in

early 2020, recorded at Rs. 0.2 billion in 2022.

Revenue from VAT increased by

50.2 per cent, in nominal terms, during 2022,

mainly reflecting the impact of the rise in price

levels and upward revisions made to the VAT

rate from June and September 2022. Since

revisions to the general VAT rate were effective

during the second half of 2022, revenue from VAT,

as a percentage of GDP, recorded only a marginal

increase from 1.8 per cent of GDP in 2021 to

1.9 per cent of GDP in 2022. Revenue from VAT

on domestic services increased to Rs. 291.6

billion in 2022, compared to Rs. 185.5 billion

in 2021, while revenue from VAT on import

related activities increased to Rs. 171.5 billion

in 2022 in comparison to Rs. 122.8 billion in the

previous year. Reflecting the nominal growth

in VAT revenue, the share of revenue from

VAT on total revenue and total tax revenue

increased to 23.4 per cent and 26.4 per cent,

respectively, compared to 21.2 per cent and

23.7 per cent, respectively, recorded in 2021.

Revenue from excise duties grew by

11.6 per cent in 2022, in nominal terms, over

the preceding year, benefitting from the

increased collection of excise duties on liquor

and cigarettes. Accordingly, revenue from excise

duties on liquor increased by 19.2 per cent to

Rs. 165.2 billion in 2022, while revenue from excise

duty on cigarettes and tobacco increased by

17.6 per cent to Rs. 104.2 billion, which could be

mainly attributable to the upward revisions made to

the excise duty structure on liquor and cigarettes

effective from November 2021. In addition to the

increase in excise duties, growth in cigarette sales

contributed to higher revenue collection from

cigarettes. Revenue from excise duty on motor

vehicles further declined by 19.9 per cent to Rs. 14.5

billion in 2022 with the continuation of restrictions

on motor vehicle imports. Moreover, revenue

from excise duty on petroleum products declined

to Rs. 53.1 billion in 2022, compared to

Rs. 55.3 billion in 2021 due to the reduction in

importation of petroleum products during 2022

amidst the foreign exchange liquidity shortage

in the country. Similarly, revenue from excise

duty, as a percentage of GDP, declined from

1.7 per cent in 2021 to 1.4 per cent in 2022,

reflecting the necessity of implementing the

inflation indexed excise duty structure for liquor

and cigarettes. With the aim of adjusting the excise

duties for inflation, the Government increased the

excise duty on cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, and

petroleum products, effective from January 2023.

Revenue from all international trade

related taxes except PAL declined during

the period under review reflecting the

partial impact of import control measures

implemented considering the balance of

payments pressures. Due to the imposition

of import control measures, including

the introduction of a license system for

non-essential goods, and lower demand for

imports amidst depreciated exchange rate and

tight financial conditions, the revenue from

import duties declined by 22.3 per cent to

Rs. 50.0 billion in 2022 in comparison to Rs. 64.3

billion recorded in 2021. Meanwhile, revenue

collection from the Special Commodity Levy

(SCL) declined significantly to Rs. 40.2 billion

in 2022 from Rs. 55.8 billion in 2021. Moreover,

revenue from CESS declined to Rs. 70.3 billion

in 2022 from Rs. 75.5 billion recorded in 2021.

However, revenue collection from PAL increased

to Rs. 180.6 billion in 2022, compared to Rs. 154.1

billion in 2021. Increase in international prices

on several items, such as petroleum products,

cement clinker, steel, raw materials, and other

consumable commodities, along with the impact

of the depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee,

contributed to the increased collection from

PAL.

Non tax revenue collection increased by

43.4 per cent, mainly due to the improved

revenue collection from fees and charges and

profits transferred by the Central Bank based

on the financial statements of 2021. Accordingly,

revenue from fees and charges increased by

Rs. 47.4 billion to Rs. 90.1 billion in 2022 mainly

due to the revision of fees and charges of postal

and railway departments. The profits transferred

by the Central Bank increased to Rs. 30.0 billion

in 2022 in comparison to Rs. 15.0 billion recorded

in 2021. In addition, social security contributions

also increased by 8.1 per cent to Rs. 37.4 billion

in 2022 over 2021. Meanwhile, revenue from rent

and interest income increased during the year by

14.1 per cent to Rs. 13.2 billion, even though profit

and dividend transfers declined by 8.2 per cent to

Rs. 28.1 billion, respectively.

Grants

Total foreign grants received from bilateral

and multilateral sources increased to Rs. 33.4

billion in 2022 from Rs. 6.7 billion in 2021.

Foreign grants from bilateral sources increased

to Rs. 18.9 billion in 2022 from Rs. 3.3 billion

recorded in 2021, while foreign grants from

multilateral sources increased to Rs. 14.5 billion

in 2022 from Rs. 3.5 billion in 2021.

Expenditure and Net Lending

Government expenditure and net lending

increased, in nominal terms, while declining as

a percentage of GDP, reflecting the significant

growth in nominal GDP in 2022. Despite the

expenditure rationalisation measures introduced

in 2022, recurrent expenditure increased by

28.1 per cent in 2022 over 2021, whereas

capital expenditure and net lending increased by

23.1 per cent during the same period, in nominal

terms. Accordingly, total expenditure and net

lending grew by 27.0 per cent, in nominal terms,

during 2022, compared to 2021. However, with

the sharp rise in nominal GDP, total expenditure

and net lending, as a percentage of GDP,

declined to 18.5 per cent in 2022, in comparison to

20.0 per cent recorded in the preceding year.

Government recurrent expenditure grew

significantly in 2022, mainly due to the increased

domestic interest payments owing to large

borrowing requirements and elevated interest

rates, along with the rise in expenditure on

salaries and wages, and subsidies and transfers.

The yields on government securities soared due

to the risk premia associated with concerns about

domestic debt restructuring. Such rise in yields

was well beyond the impact of the increase in

policy interest rates due to inflationary pressures.

Limited access to foreign financing amidst the

debt standstill, and the resultant large borrowing

requirement from domestic sources exerted

further pressures on the yields on government

securities. Accordingly, the expenditure on interest

payments, which accounted for 44.5 per cent of

total recurrent expenditure, grew by 49.3 per cent

during 2022, while domestic interest payments

rose by 80.8 per cent in 2022, compared to 2021.

Expenditure on interest payments accounted for

79.1 per cent of government revenue in 2022.

However, interest payments on foreign debt

decreased notably by 49.3 per cent during 2022

due to the temporary suspension of external debt

service payments on bilateral and commercial

debt for an interim period. Expenditure on goods

and services increased by 12.3 per cent in 2022,

compared to 2021. Salaries and wages, which

accounted for 27.2 per cent of the total recurrent

expenditure in 2022, increased by 13.1 per cent

during the year, owing to the additional monthly

allowance paid to public sector workers based on

the relief package introduced in January 2022 as

well as the impact of general annual increments.

Similarly, expenditure on other goods and services

grew by 8.2 per cent in 2022, in comparison to

the preceding year. Meanwhile, expenditure on

subsidies and transfers recorded a year-on-year

growth of 19.1 per cent in 2022, mainly due to the

additional monthly allowance paid to pensioners

and Samurdhi recipients and increased expenses

on fertiliser subsidy. However, expenditure on

supply of free medicine decreased marginally

by 0.8 per cent with the easing of the COVID-19

pandemic.

Capital expenditure and net lending

increased notably in nominal terms, mainly

due to higher lending to SOBEs. Accordingly,

capital expenditure and net lending, in nominal

terms, increased by 23.1 per cent in 2022,

compared to 2021. Following the decision of

the Government to suspend non-urgent capital

expenditure, capital transfers to public institutions,

provincial councils and public corporations

declined by 17.8 per cent in 2022. However,

net lending by the Government increased

substantially in 2022, compared to the previous

year, primarily due to lending to CPC by the

Government via the Indian line of credit to import

fuel and lending to SOEs using funds received

from the World Bank to purchase LP gas and

fertiliser. Meanwhile, public investment also grew

by 28.5 per cent to Rs. 1,014.3 billion in 2022.

Capital expenditure on social services declined by

38.4 per cent during the period under review, mainly

due to the reduction in capital expenditure on the

health sector in 2022, compared to 2021, reflecting

the impact of reduction in pandemic related

expenditure. Meanwhile, capital expenditure on

economic services increased by 60.0 per cent

due to lending to CPC and capital transfers to

SOBEs, such as CEB, National Water Supply

and Drainage Board, and Bank of Ceylon.

Key Fiscal Balances and Financing the Budget Deficit

All key fiscal balances as a percentage of

GDP improved in 2022, benefiting from the

substantial growth in nominal GDP as well

as the efforts towards fiscal consolidations.

Accordingly, the overall budget deficit declined to

10.2 per cent of GDP in 2022, in comparison to

11.7 per cent of GDP in 2021. However, the budget

deficit, in nominal terms, increased to Rs. 2,460.0

billion in 2022, compared to Rs. 2,057.9 billion

recorded in 2021. Similarly, the current account

deficit in GDP terms declined to 6.4 per cent

(Rs. 1,540.4 billion) in 2022, compared to

7.3 per cent of GDP (Rs. 1,290.4 billion) in

2021. Reflecting the discretionary fiscal policy

component of the Government, the primary deficit,

which excludes interest payments from the overall

deficit, declined both in nominal terms and as a

percentage of GDP. Accordingly, the primary deficit

declined to 3.7 per cent of GDP (Rs. 894.8 billion)

in 2022 from 5.7 per cent (Rs. 1,009.5 billion)

recorded in 2021, mainly reflecting the impact of

fiscal consolidation, primarily through revenue

enhancement measures during 2022.

The Government relied predominantly

on domestic sources to finance the budget

deficit in 2022 amidst limited access to foreign

financing. Net domestic financing1 contributed

82.7 per cent (Rs. 2,035.1 billion) of the total financing

in 2022, compared to 100.7 per cent (Rs. 2,071.8

billion) in 2021. Net domestic financing, as a

percentage of GDP, amounted to 8.4 per cent

in 2022, in comparison to 11.8 per cent in 2021.

Meanwhile, the share of net financing through foreign

sources increased to 17.3 per cent (Rs. 424.8

billion) in 2022, compared to the net repayment of

0.7 per cent (Rs. 13.9 billion) in 2021. Accordingly,

net foreign financing stood at 1.8 per cent of GDP in

2022, in comparison to the net repayment for foreign

sources of 0.1 per cent of GDP in 2021.

Net domestic financing from expansionary

sources remained significant in 2022, although

the relative contribution from such sources

to net domestic financing declined notably,

compared to the preceding year. Accordingly,

the share of net financing from the banking sector

within the domestic financing, declined to 50.5 per

cent in 2022 (4.3 per cent of GDP), compared to

63.0 per cent (7.4 per cent of GDP) in 2021. Net

financing from the Central Bank rose to Rs. 1,338.4

billion in 2022, compared to the net financing of

Rs. 1,225.2 billion in 2021. Such monetary

1 Includes all net borrowings through Treasury bonds, Treasury bills, Offshore Banking Units (OBUs), and Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs)

financing reflects the impact of direct subscription

to Treasury bills by the Central Bank amidst

subdued market appetite for government securities,

and administrative issuances of Treasury bills to

the Central Bank to meet large gross financing

needs of the Government and to meet the cashflow

requirements of the General Treasury, under

extremely challenging circumstances. However,

monetary financing in the second half of the year

was relatively low compared to the first half of 2022

due to improved government revenue collection

during this period and the receipt of financing from

multilateral and bilateral foreign sources, primarily

IDA and IBRD under the World Bank, ADB and

Indian credit lines. The Central Bank financing

includes provisional advances, which increased

to Rs. 85.5 billion in 2022, compared to the net

repayment of Rs. 3.0 billion recorded in the

previous year. Meanwhile, a net repayment of

Rs. 310.7 billion was registered in relation to

financing from Licenced Commercial Banks

in 2022, compared to a net financing of

Rs. 79.1 billion in 2021. Net financing from the

non bank sector increased to Rs. 1,007.4 billion

in 2022, compared to Rs. 767.5 billion in 2021,

whereas the share of non bank sector financing

accounted for 49.5 per cent of total net domestic

financing in 2022, compared to 37.0 per cent in

the preceding year. Net financing from the non

bank sector, as a percentage of GDP, declined to

4.2 per cent in 2022, compared to 4.4 per cent in

2021.

Net financing through Treasury bills increased

substantially during 2022, reflecting the market

appetite for short tenure instruments amidst

uncertainties about domestic debt restructuring.

increased to Rs. 2,668.3 billion in 2022 from

Rs. 1,868.3 billion in 2021. Net borrowings through

Treasury bills increased significantly to Rs. 1,608.2

billion in 2022, compared to Rs. 635.1 billion in

2021, while net borrowings through Treasury bonds

increased to Rs. 1,440.2 billion in 2022, compared

to Rs. 1,301.5 billion in 2021. However, borrowings

through SLDBs recorded a net repayment of

Rs. 380.1 billion in 2022, compared to a net

repayment of Rs. 68.3 billion in 2021. Meanwhile,

net domestic borrowings from non marketable

instruments recorded a net repayment of Rs. 633.2

billion in 2022, mainly due to the settlement of

Government overdraft balances during the year,

compared to the net borrowing of Rs. 203.5 billion

in 2021. Net repayment to OBUs during 2022 stood

at Rs. 52.2 billion.

Net financing from foreign sources

increased in 2022, compared to 2021,

mainly reflecting the impact of funding

from multilateral and bilateral sources

amidst the unprecedented economic crisis.

Owing to the repayment of a matured ISB in

January 2022 prior to the announcement of the

debt standstill, the net repayments in relation to

ISBs amounted to Rs. 100.5 billion (US dollars

500 million) in 2022, compared to a net repayment

of Rs. 199.9 billion (US dollars 1.0 billion) in 2021.

However, net financing through foreign project

and programme loans, which include financing

from several multilateral and bilateral sources,

amounted to Rs. 525.3 billion during the period

under review, compared to a net financing of

Rs. 39.3 billion recorded in 2021. The World Bank

and ADB repurposed funding from their existing

projects to meet pressing needs of the people

amidst the crisis, such as for the importation of

medicine, fertiliser, and LP gas and providing cash

transfers to vulnerable groups. Meanwhile, the

Government of India provided credit lines to Sri

Lanka for the importation of fuel, fertiliser, medical

items, food etc. during 2022. The State Bank

of India provided a credit line up to US dollars

1.0 billion for the importation of essential items, while

the EXIM Bank of India offered short term credit lines

of US dollars 500 million and US dollars 55 million to

import fuel and fertiliser, respectively. Approximately,

US dollars 200 million was drawn from the credit line

of the State Bank of India for the importation of fuel.

6.4 Government Debt and Debt

Service Payments

Central Government Debt2

Central government debt, which gradually

moved towards unsustainable levels,

particularly over the recent years, reached

a decisive moment in early 2022, resulting

in an announcement of a debt standstill by

the Government. The limited access to foreign

financing amidst Sri Lanka’s sovereign credit

rating downgrades caused a severe drain on gross

official reserves due to continued debt servicing

by drawing down the gross official reserves. With

2 The compilation of debt statistics became challenging with the ongoing debt structuring process and arrears in payments. The outstanding central government debt statistics at end 2022 are provisional, as these debt statistics exclude several overdue debt service payments, including overdue interest payments of affected debt, which are deemed to be capitalised as per the interim policy decision on debt standstill and several overdue interest payments in relation to SLDBs. The details of such payment arrears were published on the website of the Ministry of Finance, as part of data dissemination efforts under the ongoing debt restructuring process. However, such information is still being incorporated into the Commonwealth Secretariat Debt Recording and Management System (CS-DRMS), which is the data source generally used for reporting debt statistics by the Central Bank.

mounting foreign currency debt servicing and

almost exhausted usable reserves of the Central

Bank by early April 2022, the Government had to

announce a debt standstill as an interim measure,

while seeking assistance from the IMF for an EFF

supported programme and subsequent efforts

to initiate a debt restructuring process aimed at

ensuring debt sustainability in the period ahead.

Central government outstanding debt

increased significantly at end 2022, compared to

end 2021, reflecting the impact of large financing

needs of the Government, sharp depreciation of

the exchange rate, as well as the absorption of

selected SOE debt to the Central Government.

debt stock on account of provisional advances to

the Government by the Central Bank increased

from Rs. 150.1 billion at end 2021 to Rs. 235.6

billion at end 2022. Meanwhile, other remaining

short term debt, net of bank deposits, recorded a

negative balance of Rs 81.8 billion at end 2022

as the Government settled a part of its overdraft

balance during 2022. However, the medium

and long term domestic debt stock increased by

24.2 per cent by end 2022, from Rs. 7,957.4

billion by end 2021. Treasury bonds, continued

to dominate the outstanding domestic debt

portfolio, accounting for 57.9 per cent of the total

outstanding domestic debt stock (Rs. 8,709.1

billion) at end 2022 in comparison to 62.8

per cent (Rs. 6,966.2 billion) recorded as at

end 2021. Meanwhile, the resident holdings of

SLDBs declined to Rs. 382.1 billion4 (US dollars

1,052.3 million) from Rs 455.2 billion (US dollars

2,271.1 million) reported at end 2021, owing to

settlements made during the year. Resident holdings

of ISBs, in domestic currency terms, increased from

Rs. 372.6 billion at end 2021 to Rs. 635.4 billion5

by end 2022 due to the sharp exchange rate

depreciation, while the foreign currency value of

the same declined from US dollars 1,859.0 million

at end 2021 to US dollars 1,750.0 million at end

2022, due to settling of a matured ISBs amounting

to US dollars 500 million. Outstanding debt from

OBUs decreased by Rs. 7.9 billion from end 2021

to Rs. 131.4 billion (US dollars 361.8 million) by

the end of the period under review. Moreover, the

share of the banking sector debt in total domestic

debt increased to 56.7 per cent by end 2022 from

47.3 per cent at end 2021. A significant increase

in central government debt held by the Central

Bank was recorded in 2022, due to the notable

rise in Treasury bills holding to Rs. 2,575.7 billion

by end 2022 from Rs. 1,391.3 billion held at the

end of 2021. This increase was attributable to the

stock,3 in nominal terms, increased by 56.1 per cent

to Rs. 27,492.0 billion by end 2022 from

Rs. 17,614.2 billion by end 2021. As a percentage

of GDP, central government debt rose to

113.8 per cent by end 2022 in comparison to

100.1 per cent at end 2021. Meanwhile, outstanding

foreign debt of the Central Government, valued

in domestic currency, increased from 37.0 per cent

of GDP at end 2021 to 51.6 per cent of GDP by

end 2022, mainly reflecting the sharp depreciation

of the Sri Lanka rupee against major currencies

during 2022.

With the significant depreciation of

exchange rate, the relative share of foreign

debt rose by end 2022, while the relative

share of domestic debt declined from 63.0 per

cent in end 2021 to 54.7 per cent by end 2022.

Outstanding short term domestic debt increased

by 35.9 per cent by end 2022 from end 2021,

mainly reflecting the increase in the outstanding

stock of Treasury bills, which increased to

Rs. 4,113.9 billion by end 2022, from Rs. 2,270.5

billion at the end of 2021. Consequently, the

share of Treasury bills in total domestic debt

Outstanding foreign debt6 of the Central

Government, in nominal terms, increased

from Rs. 6,517.0 billion at end 2021 to

Rs. 12,458.2 billion by end 2022. The significant

depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee against major

currencies during 2022 primarily contributed to the

increase in the share of foreign debt stock within

the total outstanding debt stock to 45.3 per cent

at end 2022 from 37.0 per cent witnessed at end

2021. Within the foreign debt portfolio, multilateral

debt increased to Rs. 3,611.6 billion by end 2022,

from Rs. 1,895.3 billion registered at end 2021 due to

the domestic currency depreciation impact as well as

the receipt of multilateral funding for targeted support

during the economic crisis. Moreover, bilateral and

commercial debt, which stood at Rs. 4,621.6 billion

at the end of 2021, increased notably in 2022 to

Rs. 8,846.6 billion7 by end 2022, primarily due to the

absorption of several debts, held by the CPC, AASL,

CEB and SLPA, into central government debt, new

loans received from India for humanitarian assistance,

such as the Indian credit line as well as currency

depreciation. Amongst the commercial debt, the rupee

value of ISBs held by non residents increased by

Rs. 1,678.5 billion by end 2022 due to the

depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee against

the US dollar. The non resident holding of

Treasury bills and Treasury bonds increased to

Rs. 12.5 billion and Rs. 13.1 billion, respectively,

by end 2022 from Rs. 0.2 billion and

Rs. 1.7 billion, respectively, recorded at the end

of 2021. Due to the parity variation caused by the

sharp depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee against

major currencies during 2022, the rupee amount of

the foreign currency debt increased by around

Rs. 5,617.2 billion (23.3 per cent of GDP) at end

2022.

The restructuring of identified public debt

is expected to be completed during 2023.

Accordingly, the Government is in the process

of evaluating debt restructuring options that

could reduce the outstanding debt levels to a

manageable level, while meeting the debt

sustainability targets as per the Debt Sustainability

Analysis conducted by the IMF. With the restructuring

of public debt, the outstanding public debt is

expected to reduce to a level below 95 per cent of

GDP by 2032, the average central government gross

financing needs are to be kept below 13 per cent

of GDP during 2027 to 2032, and foreign currency

debt service payments of the Central Government

are to be maintained below 4.5 per cent of GDP in

any year during 2027 to 2032 period.

payments enabled the Government to save

a considerable amount of foreign currency

outflows providing a temporary reprieve amidst

the balance of payments crisis. The estimated

saving of foreign currency outflows through the

suspension of bilateral and commercial debt

during April to December 2022 amounted to

US dollars 2.8 billion. Due to the debt standstill,

the ISB which was due to mature in July 2022 of

US dollars 1.0 billion was not repaid. In addition,

several debt service payments related to SLDBs

were not made during the debt standstill period.

Part of these SLDB debt service payments were

settled in rupee terms. Meanwhile, multilateral

debt, new credit facilities, and any amounts

disbursed under existing credit facilities after

12 April 2022 were not subjected to the interim

policy.

The total debt service payments in 2022

recorded a notable increase in nominal terms

of 25.9 per cent, compared to 2021, owing to the

significant increase in debt amortisation and

interest payments related to domestic debt.

Domestic debt service payments increased by

57.5 per cent in 2022 over the preceding year,

reflecting the increased yields on government

securities and greater dependency on domestic

sources in deficit financing due to restrained

access to foreign financing sources. However, with

the Government’s announcement of interim policy

on the suspension of selected foreign debt service

payments since April 2022, foreign debt service

payments declined by 38.0 per cent in 2022, in

comparison to 2021.

The total amortisation payments, which

accounted for 47.8 per cent of the total debt

service payments, increased by 7.5 per cent in

2022, compared to the preceding year. Domestic

debt repayments increased by 34.3 per cent in

2022, mainly due to the increased maturities of

Treasury bonds and SLDBs. Nevertheless, foreign

debt repayments decreased by 32.6 per cent

to Rs. 358.7 billion in 2022 as a result of the debt

standstill of the Government. Foreign debt service

payments in 2022 included repayment of an ISB

that matured in January 2022, equivalent to

Rs. 100.5 billion (US dollars 500 million), compared

to Rs. 199.9 billion (US dollars 1.0 billion) of ISB

maturity payments in 2021. Amortisation payments

on domestic debt, as a percentage of GDP, slightly

declined to 4.4 per cent in 2022 from 4.5 per cent

in 2021, while amortisation payments for foreign

debt to GDP declined to 1.5 per cent in 2022 from

3.0 per cent in 2021.

Interest payments on central government

debt recorded a year-on-year growth of

49.3 per cent in 2022 with a notable rise in

the yields on government securities and

domestic borrowings. The rise in yields on

government securities surpassed the policy rate

adjustment, due to the elevated risk premia owing

to the concerns about possible restructuring of

domestic debt. Heightened pressures on domestic

sources for deficit financing amidst limited

foreign financing also contributed to the rise in

government securities yields. Consequently,

interest payment on central government domestic

debt increased by 80.8 per cent in 2022, compared

to the previous year, particularly on account

of Treasury bills and Treasury bonds. With the

suspension of interest payments on foreign bilateral

and commercial debt pursuant to the debt standstill,

interest payments on foreign debt declined by

49.3 per cent to Rs. 128.6 billion in 2022, compared

to the corresponding payments in 2021. Accordingly,

as a percentage of GDP, interest payments on

domestic debt increased to 5.9 per cent in 2022

from 4.5 per cent in 2021, while interest payments

on foreign debt decreased to 0.5 per cent of GDP

in 2022 from 1.4 per cent of GDP in the previous

year.

Debt service indicators, which include

debt and debt service ratios and debt service

coverage ratios, showed mixed performances

in 2022. Total debt service payments, as a

percentage of government revenue, declined

notably in 2022, mainly due to the notable nominal

growth in revenue collection as well as the impact

of debt standstill on debt servicing. However, the

significant rise in domestic debt service payments

posed notable pressures on the government

budget during 2022, as evident by the sharp

rise in domestic debt service payments relative

to both government revenue and government

expenditure. The foreign debt service burden

eased temporarily in 2022 under the debt

standstill, as reflected in the ratio of foreign debt

service payments to exports and the ratio of foreign

debt service payments to GDP. The ongoing debt

restructuring negotiations are expected to provide

a sizeable relief on account of reducing gross

foreign financing needs in the medium term, before

the resumption of foreign debt service payments

in the period ahead. The Government needs to

ensure that the gross financing needs and foreign

currency debt servicing are maintained at the levels

envisaged under the IMF-EFF arrangement during

2027-2032.

Outstanding Public Debt

The outstanding public debt, which

includes debt of the central government,

foreign project loans received by SOBEs,

and public guaranteed debt,8 increased to

118.7 per cent of GDP at end 2022 from

110.4 per cent of GDP at end 2021. This was

mainly due to an increase in central government

debt and the depreciation of the Sri Lanka

rupee against major currencies during 2022. In

social infrastructure development projects, including

the upgrading of education and health sectors to

improve living standards of the people. Accordingly,

the Ministry continued the Primary Health Care

System Strengthening Project and the General

Education Modernisation Programme in regional

areas during 2022. Further, several infrastructure

development projects were continued during 2022,

including the Local Government Enhancement

Sector Project (Pura Neguma programme), the

Rural Infrastructure Development Project in

Emerging Regions (RIDEP Project), and the Greater

Colombo Wastewater Management Project, in view

of improving physical infrastructure in urban as well

as other regional areas.

The Finance Commission (FC) recommended

several policy measures during the year

with the objective of ensuring balanced and

equitable socio-economic development in all

provinces. Accordingly, the FC recommended the

establishment of a powerful agency responsible

for the rational allocation of resources at both

national and provincial levels. This agency would

ensure effective utilisation of resources, while

undertaking independent and rigorous appraisal of

investment proposals to prioritise the projects with

higher economic returns. The FC recommended

that the Government to carry out a comprehensive

and independent study to formulate a policy for

locating/expanding hospitals and other health care

institutions to improve health care services at

provincial level. Further, the FC highlighted the need

to explore new avenues to empower Provincial

Councils (PCs) and local authorities with higher

revenue generation to reduce the dependency

on the central government budget. Many taxes

and fees, including motor vehicle license fees and

license fees on liquor sales outlets collected by PCs,

have not been revised in line with market conditions.

Since the revision of these fees and taxes falls

under the purview of respective line Ministries, the

FC recommended that the line Ministries revise such

fees and tax rates to increase revenue mobilisation

at provincial levels.

Budgetary Operations in Provincial Councils

The revenue collection of PCs continued

its positive momentum in 2022, with the

increase in both tax and non tax revenue

collection of PCs. Accordingly, in nominal terms,

total revenue of PCs increased by 15.4 per cent

in 2022, compared to the previous year. Tax

revenue increased by 8.6 per cent in 2022, mainly

benefitting from the increased revenue collection

from stamp duty, which grew by 9.4 per cent to

Rs. 45.1 billion in 2022 from Rs. 41.2 billion

recorded in the preceding year. Stamp duty, which

continued to be the major source of revenue of

PCs, accounted to 75.3 per cent of the total

tax revenue in 2022, compared to the share of

74.7 per cent recorded in 2021. Meanwhile,

non tax revenue increased significantly by

58.4 per cent in 2022, primarily due to the

higher revenue collection from interest income,

profits, and dividends, which increased to

Rs. 6.5 billion in 2022 from Rs. 2.2 billion

recorded in the preceding year. Meanwhile, the

share of revenue from the Western Provincial

Council in the total revenue collection of

PCs increased to 54.2 per cent in 2022 from

52.1 per cent in 2021. Amongst other PCs,

the North-Western and Southern Provinces

accounted for 9.6 per cent and 9.3 per cent of the

total revenue, respectively.

In line with the expenditure rationalisation

measures of the Government, the growth in total

expenditure of PCs moderated to 2.7 per cent in

2022, compared to the previous year, owing to

the significant reduction in capital expenditure.

Recurrent expenditure increased by 18.2 per cent

in 2022, reflecting the rise in expenditure on

personal emoluments, which remained the largest

component of recurrent expenditure with a share

of 78.4 per cent in the total recurrent expenditure

of PCs. Meanwhile, 87.5 per cent of personal

emoluments of PCs were accounted by the

education and health sectors. During the year, in

terms of total recurrent expenditure of PCs, the

Western, Central and Southern PCs recorded the

highest spending, accounting for 21.7 per cent,

12.9 per cent, and 12.7 per cent of total recurrent

expenditure of PCs, respectively. With the

commitment of the Government to reduce

expenditure by curtailing non-essential and

non-urgent capital expenditure, capital expenditure

of PCs declined significantly by 83.4 per cent

during the year over the preceding year.

Transfers from the Central Government to

PCs increased marginally by 0.1 per cent to

Rs. 318.7 billion in 2022, compared to the

previous year. An increase in transfers was

observed only in the category of block grants,

while transfers under all other categories declined

during the year. Accordingly, block grants to PCs,

which represent 93.7 per cent of the total transfers,

increased by 5.0 per cent in 2022. During the year,

transfers under Criteria Based Grants (CBG),

Province Specific Development Grants (PSDGs),

and grants for special projects declined by 70.9 per

cent, 59.6 per cent, and 23.6 per cent, respectively,

reflecting the impact of fiscal consolidation

measures of the Government. Meanwhile, transfers

from the Central Government declined to 1.4 per

cent of GDP in 2022 from 1.8 per cent of GDP in

2021. Moreover, central government transfers,

as a percentage of total expenditure of the PCs,

declined to 81.2 per cent in 2022, compared to

83.3 per cent recorded in the previous year.
