    "text": "The phenomenon of concurrent deficits in the Government budget and the external current account, emanating from the imbalances caused by excessive spending over and above a country\u2019s capacity, popularly known as Twin Deficits has remained the major structural impediment and key source of macroeconomic vulnerability in Sri Lanka for many years. Sri Lanka has been experiencing persistent external current account deficits mainly driven by large deficits in the merchandise trade account and primary income account over the years. Although the trade in services account and secondary income account (mainly workers\u2019 remittances) recorded surpluses, these surpluses have not been adequate to cushion the impact of ever widening deficits in the merchandise trade and primary income accounts in the current account. Further, Sri Lanka failed to attract non-debt creating foreign financial flows, such as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), up to the expected levels even during the post war era due to structural and policy impediments. Moreover, during the last decade, the mounting external debt of the country and the resultant large debt service payments were major contributors to the external sector imbalances worsening debt sustainability concerns. Amidst these structural weaknesses in the external sector, imprudent and swift policy changes on the fiscal front, the COVID-19 pandemic, and related uncertainties intensified its macroeconomic fragilities leading to a series of calamities. Gross official reserves declined to historical lows, with the liquid reserves falling to almost zero levels by April 2022 and the exchange rate underwent a large overshooting in early March 2022. Against this backdrop, the Government announced a debt standstill in April 2022 for an interim period, pending a debt restructuring process while commencing negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a financing arrangement. As Sri Lanka\u2019s debt is evaluated as unsustainable, the success of the IMF-Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement relies on the progress of ongoing debt restructuring. Once debt restructuring perimeters are negotiated and agreed upon with Sri Lanka\u2019s official and private creditors, the country will resume debt servicing, but on a smaller scale, with extended maturities. This first ever debt restructuring",

In the meantime, expenditure on all categories of imports have increased at a faster pace leading to widening trade deficits, especially since 2011, mainly financed through external sector borrowings. Accordingly, any effort in addressing the external current account deficit should be focused on strategies to reduce the trade deficit by simultaneous measures to increase the earnings from merchandise exports while increasing the surplus in the services account. Demand management measures through rationalisation of imports and efforts on import substitution may be introduced only on a temporary basis to preserve economic stability, as long term adaptation of such measures might undermine the competitiveness of the economy. Further, product diversification through research and development led innovation, vertical and horizontal integration, participation in production sharing networks and linking with the global value chains through component manufacturing as well as reducing over reliance on traditional markets as export destinations by way of exploring new markets could be considered as vital initiatives.

    "text": "climate in Sri Lanka. Therefore, in order to foster investor confidence, Sri Lanka needs to establish a transparent and effective policy environment by articulating a comprehensive investment policy and build the required human competencies and institutional capacities to implement policy actions. Harmonisation of foreign investment policy with other development policies and strategies, such as trade and industrial policies as well as inter agency coordination in implementing these policies remain equally important. FDI and its fringe benefits will be instrumental in helping the economy to recover in the medium to long term under the macro-fiscal adjustment programme not only by contributing to the growth drive but also through economy wide efficiency gains. While efforts have already been taken to rectify these concerns by relevant authorities, it is imperative to expedite the implementation process before global FDI flows resume to pre-pandemic levels.",

    "text": "There is also a need to limit commercial project financing and encourage financing of tradable sectors capable of generating foreign exchange to service debt. A clear and transparent evaluation and selection mechanism for external loans should be established, while improving the transparency and accountability to the public on the external borrowing, their usage, and economic implications in order to enhance the effective utilisation of the borrowings and to reduce the pressure in the domestic foreign exchange market and external reserves of the country. Further, it is needed to articulate a strategy to improve sovereign ratings to reduce high risk premiums associated with external borrowings. Nevertheless, as country ratings improve in the period ahead, the tendency for increasing the share of commercial borrowings in the overall debt portfolio needs to be prevented. It is also possible to seek the feasibility of exploring the low cost funding options for essential projects, such as those in the areas of energy and food security, and climate adoption through sustainable financing options widely being made available globally while the use of green financing options would be beneficial. The IMF-EFF arrangement gives the opportunity to enhance market sentiments to attract foreign funds to the country which would support building up official reserves. Authorities need to restore debt sustainability by meeting targets setout over the medium to long term, such as by reducing the level of public debt below 95 per cent of GDP by 2032,",
