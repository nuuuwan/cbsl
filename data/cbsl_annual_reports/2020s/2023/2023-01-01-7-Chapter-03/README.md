3.1 OverviewP

rovisioning of economic and social infrastructure services met with unprecedented challenges

during 2022 amidst the deepened balance of payments (BoP) and sovereign debt crises that led

to power and energy and humanitarian crises, inflicting significant socio-economic costs. Some

improvements could be witnessed towards the latter part of 2022 in the provisioning of economic services

with the implementation of both supply and demand management strategies, including the introduction of

cost reflective pricing in several state-owned business enterprises, among others. However, heightened

vulnerabilities in the provisioning of economic and social infrastructure services to economic headwinds

underscored the need for expeditious implementation of long overdue structural reforms in the public

sector. Significant power outages and fuel shortages, particularly during mid-2022, caused unprecedented

disruptions to socio-economic activities, resulting in a major setback to overall economic activity during 2022.

However, the severity of the energy crisis subsided in the second half of the year amidst increased contribution

of hydropower generation, and measures introduced to address supply and demand imbalances, including

the introduction of a QR code system for fuel supply, securing of foreign financial assistance to import

cooking gas, rolling out cost reflective revisions to prices of fuel products and electricity after long overdue

price adjustments. Accordingly, domestic retail prices of petroleum products were revised in multiple rounds

in 2022, based on a pricing formula from May 2022 reflecting the movements of global energy prices, among

others. Electricity tariffs were revised upward in August 2022 over eight years of hiatus, followed by another

revision in February 2023, pursuant to the establishment of a semi annual tariff revision mechanism from

2023 onwards. Water tariffs were also adjusted upward in September 2022. These price revisions, along

with the significant increase in overall price levels during 2022, caused significant distress to economically

vulnerable households, thereby worsening poverty levels.

The budgetary space for the Government to accommodate investment expenditure on infrastructure facilities

remained severely constrained during 2022. Disruptions to imported raw material availability amidst the

BoP pressures affected construction activity related to the infrastructure development. The country made

commendable progress in containing the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the healthcare sector was affected

by the shortage of pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies amidst procurement delays, while foreign

financial assistance helped lower the severity of shortages in medical supplies to some extent. Education

activities were revived in the second half of 2022 as disruptions due to energy crisis and COVID-19 on the

education system were largely abated. However, the impact of the learning losses caused by intermittent

disruptions to academic activities during the past few years continued to persist, while the inequalities

in educational outcomes among the children from underprivileged backgrounds widened, underlining the

need for concerted efforts to address anomalies in the education system. Progress in eradicating poverty

was hampered due to a rising share of the population becoming increasingly vulnerable to economic

disruptions and the slowdown in economic activity. Considering the widespread consequences of economic

crisis on living conditions of marginalised segments of the population, several initiatives were underway to

provide relief under the social safety net programmes, while measures were taken to improve efficiency

and streamline the targeting of beneficiaries for such schemes. The stark socio-economic consequences of

the worst economic crisis in the post independence Sri Lanka underscore the need for concerted efforts to

resolve vulnerabilities in the economy in a sustainable and equitable manner to improve resilience through

the enrichment of both physical and human capital over the medium term.

3.2 Economic Infrastructure Policies, Institutional Framework and Performance

Petroleum

The Government faced formidable

constraints in meeting the domestic demand

for fuel amidst an unprecedented shortage of

foreign exchange liquidity in the country in 2022.

During the year, fuel procurement procedure of the

Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) was severely

challenged by its worsened financial position

together with the sparse liquidity in the domestic

foreign exchange market, thereby resulting in

a fuel crisis in the country which led to severe

social unrest. Inconsistency in fuel distribution

and uncertainty in availability of fuel prompted

excessive hoarding of stocks by the people and led

to longer queues for fuel pumping. Considering the

essentiality of fuel imports to ensure the continuity

of economic activity, the Central Bank constantly

facilitated timely procurement of fuel by providing

the required foreign exchange liquidity to CPC.

Further, the Government secured a short term

credit line facility of US dollars 500 million from

the Import Export Bank India for financing the

purchase of petroleum products during the year,

while utilising US dollars 200 million out of the

credit facility amounting to US dollars 1,000 million

obtained from the State Bank of India for the same

amidst the worst economic crisis in the country.

Meanwhile, in May 2022, the Cabinet of Ministers

approved the implementation of a new pricing

formula for petroleum products, and accordingly a

committee was appointed to devise an appropriate

cost reflective pricing formula. The pricing formula

adopted from May 2022 was revoked subsequently

in December 2022, as the Government decided to

implement the pricing formula adopted in 2018 and

to revise domestic petroleum prices on monthly

basis. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Power and

Energy granted the approval for several bunker

license holders to supply selected fuel products

for a specific period through the oil bank at Jaya

Container Terminal to exporters, power generation

companies, tourism service providers, licensed

telecommunication service providers, and other

industries against the receipt of payment in US

dollars. In early July 2022, CPC commenced

registration of priority consumers engaged in the

export sector with business registration in Sri

Lanka to purchase fuel by paying in US dollars,

subject to a guaranteed quota for fuel. To ensure

uninterrupted supply of fuel for the transport

sector, CPC introduced a system, wherein fuel

was dispensed through its own filling stations

according to a system based on the last digit of the

vehicle number plate from late July 2022 onwards,

before implementing the QR code system for fuel

distribution. Under the National Fuel Pass QR

code system, which was effective from 01 August

2022, weekly quotas were given for prescribed

vehicle categories, thereby economising the

limited availability of fuel and distributing

island-wide under severe constraints. Further,

several measures were implemented to ensure

supply of fuel for Industries, Agriculture sector, and

Fisheries sector during the year. The Tourist Fuel

Pass prepaid card system was implemented at the

beginning of October 2022, enabling tourists to use

a US dollar denominated prepaid card to purchase

fuel at stations across the island with a view to

facilitating the recovery of the tourism industry,

following the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile,

CPC implemented the storage module concept for

importation of crude and refined products during

the latter part of 2022, enabling unloading of fuel

cargos without delays over fragmented payments

for the quantity drawn from the storage terminals

of CPC and Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals

Limited (CPSTL). This arrangement facilitated

continuous fuel supply, albeit with limitations, and

helped minimise cash flow deficiencies of CPC to

a greater extent.

Global crude oil prices remained elevated

in 2022, primarily driven by the geopolitical

tensions in Eastern Europe and the resultant

tightened global oil supply conditions, despite

the downward pressures observed towards

the second half of the year, following the

growing concerns over the global economic

slowdown. Crude oil prices were on a rising

trend during the first half of 2022 with daily prices

(Brent) briefly reaching US dollars 140 per barrel

in March 2022 for the first time since July 2008,

mainly due to the sanctions imposed on Russia by

Western countries, one of the leading exporters of

petroleum products in the world. However, from

the beginning of the second half of 2022, prices

were on a declining trend on account of the slowing

global growth along with the aggressive monetary

policy tightening measures adopted by the major

central banks around the world that were expected

to dampen global energy demand, continued

COVID-19 restrictions in China, and substantial

release of crude oil from strategic reserves of the

United States. Brief episodes of upward pressures

were observed during the latter part of the second

half of 2022 with the announcement of production

cut by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting

Countries (OPEC) and its allies in October 2022,

imposition of a price cap on Russian crude oil

by the G7 countries, along with the European

Union ban on Russian crude imports in December

2022, and signals on demand recovery in China.

The average crude oil price (Brent) increased by

39.9 per cent to US dollars 99.06 per barrel in 2022,

compared to the average price of US dollars 70.80

per barrel recorded in the previous year. The West

Texas Intermediate (WTI) price was also on a rising

trend and recorded an average of US dollars 94.41

per barrel in 2022, compared to US dollars 67.94

per barrel recorded in 2021. Nevertheless, global

crude oil prices showed a slight moderation in the

first quarter of 2023. The average global prices of

major refined petroleum products, including petrol

92 octane, petrol 95 octane, auto diesel, super

diesel, and kerosene, increased within the range of

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

103

40 to 75 per cent, year-on-year, in 2022. In line

with rising trends in global crude oil prices, the

average price of crude oil imported by the CPC

increased by 45.4 per cent to US dollars 100.11

per barrel in 2022, compared to the average of US

dollars 68.86 per barrel recorded in 2021.

As part of the demand management

strategy, while addressing financial losses

of CPC, multiple rounds of price revisions of

major petroleum products were undertaken by

CPC from March 2022, in collaboration with

the Ministry of Power and Energy. Accordingly,

domestic prices of key petroleum products sold by

CPC were revised upward in March, April, May,

June, and November of 2022, and in February 2023

in keeping with the escalation of global prices of

petroleum products. Petroleum prices were revised

downward on several occasions, in July, August,

October and December of 2022, and in January

and March 2023, following the price declines in

global markets. Further, the retail price of kerosene

was notably adjusted upward by CPC towards

the end of August 2022, to curb the substantial

losses incurred by CPC in selling kerosene at a

significantly subsidised rate. Following the price

revisions of CPC, Lanka IOC PLC (LIOC) revised

domestic prices of petroleum products upward in

eleven rounds and downward in eight rounds to

align its prices with those of CPC. Meanwhile,

the Government imposed an Excise Duty of

Rs. 25.00 per litre on imports of key refined

petroleum products with effect from 01 January

2023 to meet the debt servicing obligations of

the foreign currency debt stock of CPC, which

was transferred to the Government debt stock in

December 2022. Accordingly, the Excise (Special

Provisions) Duty on octane 92 and octane 95

petrol increased to Rs. 52.00 per litre, while the

duty applicable for super diesel and auto diesel

increased to Rs. 38.00 and Rs. 31.00 per litre,

respectively, with effect from 01 January 2023,

thereby raising the prices of domestic petroleum

products.

The overall sales volume of petroleum

products in the domestic market recorded

a decline during 2022, due to the combined

impact of lower imports amidst dearth foreign

exchange liquidity, escalated prices of

domestic petroleum products, fuel rationing

and subdued economic activity during the

year. The Government took measures to introduce

demand management strategies by implementing

a QR code based fuel rationing system from

August 2022 onwards with a view to smoothening

the supply and demand in the domestic market.

In 2022, total petroleum sales registered a

year-on-year contraction of 13.8 per cent with

a decline in sales volumes of CPC, while sales

volumes of LIOC recorded a notable growth

during the period under review amidst disrupted

fuel supply of CPC. The sales of CPC to the

transport sector, which accounted for 73 per cent

of the total sales of CPC, recorded a year-on-year

contraction of 17.1 per cent, while the sales to the

aviation sector recorded a year-on-year growth of

9.8 per cent, mainly reflecting the base effect due

to the impact of COVID-19 in 2021. The increased

reliance on hydropower generation supported by

favourable reservoir levels and continuous load

shedding amidst limited fuel supply owing to dearth

of foreign exchange liquidity resulted in an overall

decline in fuel demand from the power generation

sector during the year. Accordingly, sales of fuel for

power generation recorded a contraction of 6.8 per

cent, year-on-year, during the period under review.

The output from the refinery of petroleum

products recorded a notable overall decline of

55.4 per cent in 2022 due to frequent closures

of the Sapugaskanda refinery in the absence of

regular crude oil importation due to the dearth of

foreign exchange. During 2022, the Sapugaskanda

refinery remained closed for almost 225 days due

to unavailability of crude oil for refinery operations.

Accordingly, overall crude oil throughput declined

by 58.4 per cent, year-on-year while refinery

output of key products, such as diesel, petrol,

fuel oil, and naphtha, dropped by 65.4 per cent,

68.8 per cent, 45.7 per cent, and 71.2 per cent,

respectively, during the period under review.

Financial performance of CPC worsened

further in 2022, largely driven by losses due

to significant depreciation of the exchange

rate, despite the cost reflective price revisions,

which were mostly implemented in the second

half of 2022. As per the unaudited provisional

financial statements, the operational loss of CPC

was limited to Rs. 6.2 billion in 2022, compared to

the operational loss of Rs. 41.3 billion recorded in

the previous year, partially reflecting the impact of

price revisions amidst notable fluctuations in global

crude oil prices. The sharp nominal depreciation of

the Sri Lanka Rupee against the US dollar during

March-May 2022 resulted in a notable exchange

rate variation loss of Rs. 527.0 billion to CPC,

weighing on its financial performance recording an

overall loss (before tax) of Rs. 615.1 billion in 2022,

compared to the loss (before tax) of Rs. 81.8 billion

recorded in 2021. However, CPC continued to

record profit (before taxes) on a monthly basis, from

July 2022 onwards due to the cost reflective price

adjustments and gradual stabilisation in exchange

rate volatilities. Meanwhile, with the Governmentâ€™s

decision to transfer Government guaranteed foreign

currency debt stock of CPC amounting to US dollars

2.5 billion to the Government balance sheet as a

measure to improve the financial viability of CPC,

the outstanding foreign currency denominated

loans and import bills of CPC to the banking sector

reduced to US dollars 0.2 billion by end 2022

from US dollars 3.4 billion recorded at end 2021.

CPCâ€™s total outstanding trade receivables from

public corporations increased by Rs. 59.3 billion to

Rs. 220.3 billion by end 2022 from end 2021. Of

the outstanding total trade receivables of CPC, the

SriLankan Airlines (SLA) and Ceylon Electricity

Board (CEB) accounted for 49.3 per cent and

31.1 per cent, respectively, by end 2022, from

38.6 per cent and 51.5 per cent, respectively,

reported at end 2021. The rupee value of trade

receivables from SLA increased notably during

2022, with the parity adjustment to SLAâ€™s liabilities

to the CPC, in line with the sharp depreciation of

the exchange rate.

Several infrastructure development

initiatives and legal enforcements aimed at

enhancing the efficiency and performance

of the petroleum industry in Sri Lanka

were implemented in 2022. To smoothen the

provisioning of fuel supply in the country, many

deregulation strategies were implemented amidst

the unprecedented fuel crisis that the country

experienced with a heavy toll on economic

activity. Accordingly, with the approval of Cabinet

of Ministers, Expressions of Interest (EOI) were

called from new fuel suppliers, including companies

established in petroleum producing countries, to

explore a feasible business model for importation,

distribution and selling of petroleum products in the

domestic market. This process was complemented

by the enactment of the Petroleum Products (Special

Provisions) (Amendment) Act, No. 27 of 2022 with

effect from 26 October 2022. During the year,

the infrastructure development initiatives of CPC

were impeded primarily with financial constraints,

resulting in modest progress in CPCâ€™s development

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

106

projects. As a part of the Bandaranaike International

Airport (BIA) development project, the installation of

fuel hydrant system for the new Apron E, upgrading

of the CPC fuel farm facilities, and modification and

retrofitting of the fuel hydrant system in existing

Aprons A, B, and C were underway during the year.

Meanwhile, the agreement for the development

of the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm was signed on

06 January 2022 with the participation of CPC,

LIOC, and Trinco Petroleum Terminal (Pvt) Limited

(TPTL). Accordingly, in 2022, TPTL undertook a

range of initiatives to develop 61 tanks, which were

falling within its purview. In this regard, a health

assessment of 10 storage tanks and a detailed

feasibility study were in progress in 2022. During the

year, CPC prepared a development plan and set up

a procurement process for preliminary land clearing

and land surveying activities by selecting contractors

to develop CPC owned 24 tanks in Trincomalee Oil

Tank Farm. Meanwhile, as the regulatory body for

offshore hydrocarbon exploration, development, and

production work of the Government, the Petroleum

Development Authority of Sri Lanka (PDASL)

continued its efforts to develop the upstream

petroleum industry in Sri Lanka. As stipulated in

the Petroleum Resources Act, No. 21 of 2021,

PDASL continued its engagement with regard to

strengthening its mandate on offshore hydrocarbon

exploration operations. Further, following the review

of the international block demarcation processes

and current industry trends, a new offshore

hydrocarbon exploration block map, comprising

around 900 small blocks within the three large

basins covering the Mannar, Cauvery, and Lanka,

was devised and gazetted in July 2022. Seismic

data were analysed in multiple occasions and the

feasibility of Sri Lankaâ€™s petroleum exploration

was conveyed to the Government over several

decades by experts in the field. Yet the same

process is repeated and promotional expenditure

is incurred under successive governments. It is yet

to see actual exploration of gas or oil on countryâ€™s

hydrocarbon deposits. Therefore, PDASL should

aim to engage with an effective explorer and ensure

that exploration of oil/gas begins in the near future.

The supply of LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas)

in the country was significantly interrupted by

the shortage of foreign exchange mainly during

the first half of 2022, largely affecting urban

and semi-urban households. However, with the

receipt of financial assistance from the World Bank

and the Central Bank's actions to increase foreign

exchange liquidity in the banking system helped

importation of LPG, restoring normalcy of LPG

supply in the domestic market. In August 2022, the

Cabinet of Ministers approved the adoption of a

cost reflective formula to determine domestic LPG

prices of which the implementation commenced

since August 2022. Litro Gas Lanka Ltd. revised

domestic prices upward in April, July, November

and December 2022, and February 2023 and prices

revised downward in August, September, and

October 2022, and January 2023 on easing global

price. Following suit, Laugfs Gas PLC revised

domestic prices upward thrice in March and June

2022 and February 2023, with three downward

revisions in August and October 2022 and January

2023. Further, the Ports and Airports Development

Levy (PAL) on LP gas imports was reduced to

2.5 per cent of import cost from 7.5 per cent, with

effective from 01 January 2023.

Following the overall trend in global energy

prices, the average global LPG prices remained

at elevated levels during 2022, despite the

notable moderation observed since May 2022.

The average price of LPG in the global markets

(based on the Propane:Butane ratio of 30:70),

in April 2022 due to heightened supply side risks

in the global energy market, declined by around

31.9 per cent to US dollars 650 per metric ton in

December 2022, reflecting the moderation in global

consumption demand. However, global LPG prices

remained above US dollars 700 per metric ton at

the end of the first quarter of 2023.

Electricity

Provision of electricity in 2022 was hampered

mainly by the shortages of fuel and coal for

power generation amidst the dearth of foreign

exchange liquidity and the decline in reservoir

levels. This warranted significant demand

management measures in the power sector,

causing long power outages, particularly during

the months of March and April, severely affecting

economic activity. Accordingly, CEB undertook

daily scheduled power cuts since February 2022

as a demand management strategy amidst low

reservoir water levels in early 2022. The length

of power outages increased to over 10 hours per

day towards early April 2022, reflecting the sharp

drop in reservoir water levels due to dry weather

conditions, the lack of fuel for power generation

amidst the cashflow pressures of CEB to procure

fuel, and delays in procuring fuel due to the foreign

exchange pressures in the country. The torrential

monsoon rains during May-September 2022

supported the provisioning of electricity, largely

through hydropower generation, thereby curbing

high reliance on thermal sources. Accordingly, the

load shedding was gradually confined to one to

three hours per day since May 2022 with favourable

reservoir levels under conducive weather patterns,

despite frequent shutdowns of several thermal

plants amidst fuel shortages and intermittent

closures of certain units of the Norochcholai

coal power plant due to scheduled maintenance

and repairs. Despite favourable reservoir levels,

vulnerabilities in provisioning of electricity increased

towards the latter part of 2022 due to interruptions

in the coal procurement process during the period

of coal importation spanning from September 2022

to April 2023. The delays in coal shipments were

caused by foreign exchange shortages, cashflow

issues of CEB, and issues in the procurement

procedure of coal. To mitigate the vulnerabilities in

electricity provisioning, urgent actions were taken

by the authorities to smoothen the procurement of

coal, while the Central Bank continued to facilitate

coal procurement by establishing a sinking fund to

provide required foreign exchange for importation of

coal since September 2022. However, purchasing

of foreign exchange by the Central Bank to the coal

fund was discontinued in early 2023 along with the

gradual improvement in foreign exchange liquidity

in the domestic market.

Total electricity generation registered a

decline of 4.6 per cent in 2022, as a result of the

disruptions to the coal and fuel imports needed

for thermal power generation during the year.

Accordingly, total power generation declined to

15,942 GWh in 2022, compared to 16,716 GWh in

2021. Total hydropower generation, fuel oil-based

power generation and coal power generation

decreased by 4.9 per cent to 5,364 GWh,

6.3 per cent to 2,467 GWh and 6.3 per cent to 5,174

GWh, respectively, during the year, compared to

2021. Power generation through Non-Conventional

Renewable Energy (NCRE) sources recorded

a marginal growth of 0.5 per cent to 2,937 GWh

during the period under review. The contribution

of hydro, fuel, coal, and NCRE to total power

generation stood at 33.6 per cent, 15.5 per cent,

32.5 per cent, and 18.4 per cent, respectively,

reflecting the increased reliance on low cost

renewable sources over the expensive thermal

sources during the year. In addition, CEB accounted

for about 76.7 per cent of total power generation,

while the remainder was purchased from

Independent Power Producers (IPPs). Meanwhile,

the overall transmission and distribution loss as a

proportion of total power generation were limited

to 8.9 per cent in 2022, compared to 9.0 per cent

in 2021. In early 2023, electricity generation was

mainly based on thermal sources due to the rapid

depletion of reservoir levels caused by the onset of

seasonal dry spell conditions.

Total electricity sales declined by

4.6 per cent to 14,520 GWh in 2022, driven by

power interruptions and the contraction in

demand from major user categories. Despite

improvements in electricity sales during the early

part of 2022, alongside the recovery of economic

activity following the COVID-19 pandemic,

consumption volumes of electricity declined

notably thereafter, owing to power interruptions.

Reflecting the impact of load shedding, sales

to the domestic, industry, and government

categories recorded contractions of 3.7 per cent,

10.1 per cent, and 8.3 per cent, respectively,

during the period. Electricity sales to the hotel and

general purpose categories recorded increases of

11.7 per cent and 2.3 per cent, respectively, primarily

due to the statistical impact of lower base in 2021.

Meanwhile, recognising the need for adopting

state-of-the-art technologies, CEB initiated a project

to implement smart metering techniques in order to

collect accurate and real time sales data on energy

usage, while notifying users of their consumption

levels. However, the progress of this project was

hampered due to several factors, including high

costs of smart metres, lack of awareness among

users, and technical issues. With due consideration

to enable an efficient meter reading system and

to minimise the issues in billing procedure, the

implementation of expedient measures by CEB to

collect accurate energy usage data on real time

basis remains important, to improve the cashflows

of CEB.

After a hiatus of eight years, electricity

tariffs were revised upward in 2022 considering

the soaring cost of power generation, which

further exacerbated the financial woes of CEB.

On 10 August 2022, electricity tariffs were revised,

with an average upward revision of 75 per cent,

taking into account the energy affordability of low

income households by allowing concessions on

the fixed charge for low consumption categories

of 0-30 unit and 31-60 unit blocks. However, even

after this upward revision, CEB was unable to

achieve a break-even level of financial performance

as reflected in their financial statements, underlining

the need for regular cost reflective price revisions

to ensure the financial viability of CEB. With such

consideration, the Cabinet of Ministers approved

the establishment of a semi annual tariff revision

mechanism from 2023 through an automatic cost

recovery based tariff adjustment. Accordingly,

electricity tariffs were revised again, with effect from

15 February 2023, on an average of 66 per cent.

Under this tariff revision, both fixed and energy

rates were substantially increased for the domestic

consumer category with the consumption range

of 0-90 units per month, which accounts for over

75 per cent of domestic household consumers.

Accordingly, the unit price of electricity was revised

upwards for consumer categories below the monthly

consumption of 90 units, ranging from 160 per cent

to 275 per cent. Further, as per the usage wise block

classification, prices of one unit of electricity on other

sectors of general purpose, hotel, and Government

were revised upwards ranging from 70 to

100 per cent, while consumer blocks under industry

category witnessed an increase of 25 per cent in

unit price of electricity during this latest revision.

Despite the latest upward revision of electricity

tariffs, certain consumer categories continue to avail

subsidised rates in comparison to CEBâ€™s estimated

average selling price of Rs. 48.74 per kWh for 2023.

However, without a comprehensive restructuring of

CEB, no benefits can be passed onto the customers.

The continuous increases of tariffs have resulted in

higher cost of production as well as social unrest

due to unaffordability of electricity bill payments

by some segments of the society. In this regard,

unpaid bills by certain individuals and institutions

should be collected and disputed bill payments be

expeditiously concluded.

Increased reliance on hydropower generation

and upward revisions to electricity tariffs helped

improve the financial performance of CEB in

2022, despite the surge in cost of thermal power

generation. Accordingly, the operating loss of

CEB was moderated since August 2022, partly

due to the cashflow improvements along with the

tariff revision. However, on a cumulative basis,

CEB reported a loss of Rs. 272.9 billion in 2022,

compared to the loss of Rs. 34.6 billion recorded in

2021. This includes a part of the revaluation loss

of the foreign loan outstanding of the Norochcholai

coal power plant, amounting to Rs. 94.7 billion.

Short term debt of CEB from banks and other

outstanding liabilities to CPC and IPPs increased

to Rs. 361.9 billion by end 2022 from Rs. 289.0

billion recorded by end 2021. Meanwhile,

non-settlement of payment dues by CEB since late

2021 amounting to Rs. 37.3 billion for renewable

energy purchases remained a hindrance to

expand the renewable sector contribution to power

generation. Meanwhile, under the Government

initiatives to transfer the identified liabilities of

State Owned Enterprises to the balance sheet

of the Government, and thereby to strengthen

the financial viability of such institutions, the

approval of Cabinet of Ministers was granted for

the transfer of CEBâ€™s liabilities of Rs. 61.0 billion

of loan disbursement under seven projects and

Rs. 85.6 billion of debt servicing of Norochcholai

project to the Government. As a result, total long

term liabilities of CEB declined to Rs. 346.0 billion

by end 2022 from Rs. 541.2 billion recorded

at end 2021. With these measures, along with

regular cost reflective tariff revisions, significant

improvements are expected in cashflows of CEB,

thereby enabling it to meet demand for electricity

without disruptions, while lessening the burden on

government cashflows and the overall economy.

Heightened vulnerabilities in the power

and energy sector due to persistent delays

in implementing required reforms caused

significant socio-economic costs in 2022,

thereby underscoring the need for expeditious

implementation of reforms to ensure energy

security of the country. The Government

undertook several initiatives in 2022 with a view

to transforming the power and energy sector to an

economically viable sector without being a burden

on the government budget. The State Owned

Enterprise Restructuring Unit, established under

the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilisation and

National Policies in 2022, is expected to facilitate

the restructuring of government owned business

entities, including CEB. Meanwhile, a cabinet sub

committee was appointed at end August 2022 to

identify the policies and strategies, including the

restructuring of CEB through the unbundling its key

operations of generation, transmission, distribution,

and other functions of CEB to develop the

energy sector in a sustainable manner, to submit

appropriate recommendations, and to provide

necessary guidance to expedite the implementation

of decisions. Accordingly, the report, which was

submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers on 'National

Energy Potentials, Strategies and the Roadmap

for the Next Decade', was approved in late 2022.

In addition, the Long Term Generation Expansion

Plan 2022â€“2041 (LTGEP) was prepared during

2022. This development plan is expected to

expand the share of renewable energy of the total

electricity generation to 70 per cent by 2030, while

committing to carbon neutrality in power generation

by 2050, thereby ceasing the construction of new

coal power plants and expanding the capacity

from clean energy sources. The updated LTGEP

2023â€“2042 was drafted in accordance with

Government policies and submitted to the Public

Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka for approval in

September 2022, and the subsequent approval

was received in February 2023. Meanwhile, the Sri

Lanka Electricity Act, No.20 of 2009 was amended,

removing procedural obstacles to facilitate the

development of renewable energy sector, and the

Sri Lanka Electricity (Amendment) Act, No.16 of

2022 was published in June 2022.

Diversifying energy sources and expanding

generation capacity remain major priorities of

the Government in fulfilling the rising energy

demand in the period ahead. Plans and projects

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

111

for the construction of several new power plants are

currently underway, albeit at a slower pace. Given

the economic and environmental implications of

conventional coal and fuel based power generation,

the Government has opted to diversify the energy

mix by including new energy sources, such as

liquefied natural gas (LNG). Accordingly, the

300 MW Sobadhanavi LNG plant in Kerawalapitiya

is under construction, and is scheduled to be

operational in 2024. The preliminary process for

a second 300 MW LNG plant in Kerawalapitiya,

which is expected to be operational from 2025,

is also underway. In accordance with the draft

LTGEP 2023-2042, it is expected that an internal

combustion engine plant with 200 MW capacity

and a gas turbine plant (thermal based) with 100

MW capacity will be added to the grid in 2026 and

2027, respectively. However, as per the LTGEP

2023-2042, several thermal power plants and LNG

power plants will be added to the grid in the coming

years to expand the nation's installed capacity,

with scheduled retirement of several old thermal

plants. In the meantime, the power transmission

and distribution system are being expanded and

strengthened through various projects to reduce

system losses, connect more energy sources to the

grid, and maintain system reliability.

Efforts are underway to construct new

renewable energy plants with the aim of

reducing the reliance on expensive thermal

energy, subject to an objective analysis of the

environmental, social and governance (ESG)

issues. Accordingly, the 35 MW Broadlands

hydropower project was in the commissioning

stage at end of 2022, while other hydropower

projects, such as Uma Oya (120 MW), Moragolla

(31 MW), Gin Ganga (20 MW), and Thalpitigala (15

MW) were in progress. Subsequent to the addition

of a large-scale 100 MW Mannar wind power plant

by mid 2021, several new wind power projects are

in the pipeline, including a 50 MW Mannar wind

park as an extension to the existing plant and

another two wind plants in Mannar (Phase II and III,

100 MW each). Further, the preliminary identified

wind potential areas that are earmarked in the

Renewable Energy Resource Development Plan

(2021â€“2026), including Veravil Wind Project (200

MW), Karachchi Wind Project (100 MW), Ponnalei

Wind Power Project (100 MW), and Manthai West

Wind Power Project (100 MW) are in the preliminary

stages of implementation. Under the energy parks

development projects, for the Pooneryn renewable

energy park project of 233 MW wind power

capacity and 150 MW solar power capacity, the

initial development measures to install 100 MW

wind power capacity were carried out in 2022.

Construction of the 100 MW Siyambalanduwa

solar power project was underway during the year,

while a weather station was set up in the project

area to gather data that to be used in the effective

design of the power station. Further, feasibility

studies for large scale solar projects in Hambantota

and Trincomalee were initiated to expand solar

capacity. Under the Soorya Bala Sangramaya,

capacity addition to the national grid by rooftop

solar system was about 231 MW in 2022, whereas

projects with a total capacity of around 32 MW are

to be commissioned for which the power purchase

agreements were signed. Accordingly, in total,

about 670 MW have been added to the national grid

under this project since its inception. Installation

of solar rooftops on government buildings, solar

power kits with energy storage facilities for low

income housing units, religious places, and reverse

osmosis plants as well as floating solar pilot

projects to add 135 MW of solar power capacity

were initiated in 2022 under the Indian credit line of

US dollars 100 million. An agreement was signed

to implement a hybrid renewable energy system in

the islands of Jaffna, namely Analaitivu, Delft and

Nainativu, with US dollars 11 million assistance

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

112

from India. The project will include hybrid power

plants based on solar, wind, diesel, and lithium-ion

storage batteries and is expected to be finished

by early 2024. Considering notable changes in

cost parameters over the period, feed in tariffs

applicable for renewable energy purchases of CEB

were revised in September 2022, for the first time

since 2012, with a view to promoting renewable

energy sector. Meanwhile, PAL applicable on the

importation of solar static converters was lifted in

early 2023 aimed at supporting the expansion of

solar power generation. Despite the numerous

efforts towards expanding renewable energy

sector in 2022, development of the renewable

energy sector continued to grapple with a host of

difficulties hindering the progress in the sector.

Higher capital costs and import costs, payment

delays to small power producers, capacity

constraints in the national transmission grid, among

others, continued to impede the expansion of the

renewable energy sector of the country. Against

this backdrop, concerted efforts of all stakeholders

in the power and energy sector are imperative

to build a conducive environment for renewable

energy investments to ensure the energy security

of the country in a sustainable manner.

The Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority

(SLSEA) continued its efforts to encourage

sustainable energy development in the country.

SLSEA continued to engage in developing all forms

of renewable energy, improving energy efficiency,

encouraging energy conservation by reducing

energy waste, formulating conducive policies,

managing and analysing energy information,

ensuring necessary investments in the sustainable

energy sector, and making the Sri Lankan society

energy conscious. Energy management and

conservation programmes, resource mapping

programmes, and policy advocacy programmes

were carried out during the year, while the revision

of the Renewable Energy Resource Development

Plan for 2024-2029 was also initiated in 2022

with the goal of ensuring energy security. The

Training Hub for Renewable Energy Technologies

in Sri Lanka (THREE Lanka) project was also

underway in collaboration of universities in Europe

and Sri Lanka. Also, there is funding available for

environmental friendly renewable energy projects

at affordable costs under the EU, World Bank and

Asian Development Bank (ADB) which can be

tapped depending on transparent processes and

procedures followed by the countries concerned,

and therefore Sri Lanka should endeavor to access

these projects early.

Road Development

The progress of road infrastructure

development initiatives of the Government

remained modest in 2022, reflecting the tight

fiscal conditions amidst cash flow pressures.

The Road Development Authority (RDA) incurred

around Rs. 195.4 billion on various activities, aimed

at improving the road network via maintenance,

widening and enhancement of expressways,

highways and roads, construction of bridges and

flyovers, and restoring roads damaged by natural

disasters. Accordingly, expenditure incurred in

developing expressways and highways, amounted

to Rs. 34.4 billion and Rs. 145.0 billion, respectively,

during the year, while Rs. 6.6 billion was spent on the

construction of bridges and flyovers. Although the

annual budgetary allocation for RDA was revised in

many occasions under the Governmentâ€™s efforts on

expenditure curtailment, the expenditure incurred

remained below the finalised annual allocation of

Rs. 247.8 billion for 2022. Meanwhile, reflecting

the lack of investment in road network expansion

during the last few years, the total length of National

Highways consisting of A and B class roads and

the total length of expressways maintained by RDA

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

113

remained broadly unchanged at 12,225 kilometers

and 312.6 kilometers, respectively, as at end 2022

compared to the previous year.

The progress in the development of the

expressway network remained stagnant

during the year. Overall construction work of the

Central Expressway from Kadawatha to Dambulla

registered a meagre progress in 2022, largely due

to severe financial constraints of the Government.

By end 2022, the highway section spanning from

Kadawatha to Meerigama had made a cumulative

physical progress of 34.8 per cent in civil works,

up from 19.4 per cent at the end of 2021. In

addition, section II of the Central Expressway,

which spans from Meerigama to Kurunegala, was

completed and opened to the public mid January

2022. Meanwhile, construction activities of the

section spanning from Kahathuduwa to Ingiriya

under the Ruwanpura Expressway extending from

Kahathuduwa to Palmadulla progressed at a slow

pace in 2022. Further, following the decision of the

Ministry of Highways, RDA revisited the feasibility

study of the phases II and III of the Ruwanpura

Expressway. Despite the constraints due to

shortages in raw materials, escalating input costs

and liquidity shortages in foreign exchange, the

construction of the Port Access Elevated Highway

Project connecting the Port City and Galle Face to

the expressway network continued throughout the

year and achieved 54.3 per cent physical progress

by end of 2022.

Overall vehicular traffic along the

expressways declined in 2022. The average

number of daily traveled vehicles on the Southern

Expressway from Kottawa to Godagama and from

Palatuwa to Mattala slowed down by 13.3 per cent

and 18.2 per cent, respectively, in 2022 to 28,448

and 6,425, respectively, compared to the previous

year, reflecting the impact of fuel shortages. The

Outer Circular Highway also showed a decline in

daily average traffic movements by 24.0 per cent

to 28,291 from 37,219 traveled vehicles reported

in 2021. Meanwhile, the daily average number

of vehicles plying the Colombo Katunayake

Expressway grew by 14.0 per cent in 2022,

compared to the previous year. During the year,

revenue from expressways declined to around

Rs. 7.9 billion, recording a 10.1 per cent drop,

compared to 2021. However, the newly opened

Meerigama to Kurunegala section of the Central

Expressway attracted an average of 9,106 vehicles

per day and generated revenue of Rs. 703.8 million

in 2022, partly offsetting the overall drop in annual

revenue from expressways during the period under

review.

Developing and rehabilitating activities

of road networks and bridges progressed at

a slower pace during 2022. During the year,

the Southern Road Connectivity Project (SRCP)

was mostly completed and the preliminary

work of Lunugala - Bibile section under the

Badulla - Chenkaladi Road Improvement Project

(A005) was commenced. Several other road

development projects, including Phase I and

Phase II of the Integrated Road Investment

Programme, Kandy Multimodal Transport Terminal

Development Project (KMTTDP), and Inclusive

Connectivity and Development Project (ICDP) were

in progress during the year. In 2022, reconstruction

activities of some bridges on national roads

were conducted, while the flyovers connecting

Baladaksha Mawatha and Sir Chithampalam

A. Gardiner Mawatha, Justice Akbar Mawatha

Railway Level Crossing, and Uththarananda

Mawatha Railway Level Crossing were also in

progress, albeit at a slower pace.

Road Passenger Transportation

Road passenger transportation activities

improved in 2022 reflecting the gradual

normalisation of public mobility with the easing

of COVID-19 risks, despite fuel shortages and

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

114

cost escalations. Accordingly, the operated

kilometrage and passenger kilometrage of the

Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) increased

significantly by 41.2 per cent and 141.0 per cent,

respectively, during the year, compared to 2021.

In 2022, the total number of buses owned by

SLTB marginally decreased by 1.2 per cent to

6,932, compared to the previous year, and none

of the new buses were deployed under SLTB.

During the period, the average number of buses

operated by SLTB increased notably by 216.3 per

cent to 4,279, which was around 84.2 per cent

of the total fleet effectively available for public

transportation operations of SLTB. Meanwhile,

operated kilometrage and passenger kilometrage

of the private sector also increased by 24.4 per cent

and 23.4 per cent, respectively, during the year. The

average number of buses operated by the private

sector increased by 8.3 per cent to 9,807 by end

2022, compared to 9,053 in 2021. The number of

inter-provincial and intra-provincial permits issued

by the National Transport Commission (NTC)

for private bus operations recorded at 3,129 and

16,733, respectively, at end 2022.

Improvements in the public transport sector

remained modest to cater for plausible surge in

demand for public transport facilities, following

the hikes in fuel prices. During the year 2022, NTC

continued to carry out its regular programmes to

ensure the uninterrupted provisioning of transport

facilities, while the progress in several initiatives

targeted at enhancing the quality of public

transport remained modest amidst financial

constraints faced by NTC. The two special bus

services under NTC; 'Sisu Seriya' and 'Nisi Seriya'

services were further enhanced, by deploying 52

and 25 new services to both services, respectively.

Accordingly, as of end 2022, 1,617 services were

in operation under 'Sisu Seriya' and 219 services

were in operation under the 'Nisi Seriya' bus

service programme. Meanwhile, a new programme

to facilitate school children was commenced, but

at non-subsidised prices as the funds allocated to

NTC by the Government for 2022 were inadequate

to facilitate new services under 'Sisu Sariya', to

cater to the rising demand with the rise in cost of

private school transport services amidst fuel price

hikes. During 2022, NTC in collaboration with SLTB

implemented many measures to provide adequate

fuel for privately owned passenger transport buses

and school transport services to ensure continuity

in public transport sector. Meanwhile, an increase

in demand for public transport facilities was

observed in 2022, amidst the shortages in fuel,

and significant upward revisions to fuel prices,

which forced individuals to opt for public transport

services. Demand for public transport facilities

is likely to expand further in the future with the

increased fuel prices and moderation of incomes

amidst tax reforms, among others. Urgent policy

measures to improve the public transport sector in

the country may be required.

During the year, bus fares were revised in

seven rounds, mostly in line with the domestic

fuel price revisions. Accordingly, the minimum

bus fare was increased to Rs. 40.00 from Rs. 17.00

in the initial five rounds of revisions during the

year. However, at the last two revision cycles, the

minimum bus fare was brought down to Rs. 34.00

by the end of 2022. The fares of normal, luxury, and

semi-luxury bus services almost doubled during the

year. In line with the increase in fuel prices, the bus

fare of 'Sisu Seriya', 'Nisi Seriya', and 'Gami Sariya'

services were revised upward by 135.1 per cent,

136.8 per cent, and 134.2 per cent to Rs.134.00,

Rs. 45.00 and Rs. 89.00, respectively, during the

year.

The financial performance of SLTB

continued to remain weak during 2022, albeit

the favourable improvements in the revenue

side. Although some favourable improvements

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

115

in revenue could be observed during the year

supported by the upward revisions in bus fares in

multiple rounds, such impacts were offset by the

notable acceleration in expenditures amidst high

fuel prices. As per unaudited financial statements,

the total revenue of SLTB increased by

147.0 per cent to Rs. 69.3 billion in 2022, while

total expenditure also increased by around 123.7

per cent to Rs. 69.5 billion. SLTB recorded an

operational loss of Rs. 0.3 billion in 2022, compared

to an operational loss of Rs. 3.1 billion recorded in

the previous year. Given the sharp upward

adjustments in bus fares, a significant increase

was recorded in the demand for season tickets.

Consequently, the subsidy provided by the

Government to facilitate subsidised season tickets

for students increased to Rs. 6.1 billion in 2022

from Rs. 5.3 billion in 2021, while the subsidy

on operations with respect to uneconomical

routes amounted to Rs. 2.7 billion during 2022,

compared to Rs. 5.3 billion reported in 2021.

In early 2023, SLTB distributed 75 buses of 125

new buses received under the Indian line of

credit, among regional depots, while 50 buses

were registered under the Department of Motor

Traffic (DMT). NTC, in collaboration with SLTB,

initiated a project to issue prepaid cards for the

convenience of the commuters and the latest pilot

project was inaugurated in private buses plying

from the Makumbura Multimodal Transport Center

in Kottawa to Galle on the Southern Expressway

in early February 2023. This project is expected to

extend to train commuters following the successful

deployment in the road passenger sector. DMT

also initiated the preliminary work pertaining to

electrification of internal combustion engine three

wheelers and motorcycles during the year 2022.

New registration of motor vehicles recorded

a notable decline for the third consecutive year

in 2022, due to the restrictions on motor vehicle

imports, prevailing since 2020. Accordingly,

new registrations of motor vehicles declined by

39.4 per cent, year-on-year, in 2022, largely

reflecting contractions in the registration of motor

cars, three wheelers, goods transport vehicles,

and land vehicles during the period under review.

However, compared to 2021, registration of

motorcycles and buses increased by 13.1 per cent

and 43.8 per cent, respectively, during the year.

Rail Transportation

The Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) recorded a

modest operational improvement during 2022,

reflecting the gradual restoration of public

mobility following the COVID-19 pandemic.

The estimated overall operated kilometrage and

passenger kilometrage of SLR increased notably

by 67.3 per cent and 205.9 per cent, year-on-year,

respectively, during 2022. However, the goods

kilometrage recorded a decline of 14.2 per cent,

year-on-year, to 138.7 million mt km during the

period under review, compared to 161.6 million mt

km recorded in the previous year.

The financial performance of SLR remained

subdued in 2022. According to the provisional

financial statements, operating loss incurred

by SLR rose further to Rs. 12.4 billion during

the year, in comparison to the operating loss of

Rs. 10.3 billion in 2021. The total revenue of SLR

increased by Rs. 8.4 billion to Rs. 11.1 billion in

2022, compared to the previous year. This was

primarily due to the improvements in revenue

generated from passenger transport activities

resulting from the train fare hike with effect from

July 2022. Meanwhile, total expenditure of SLR

increased by Rs. 2.1 billion to Rs. 42.5 billion

during 2022, which can primarily be attributed to

the substantial increase in recurrent expenditure

with upward adjustments in fuel prices during

the year. Recurrent expenditure increased by

81.2 per cent to Rs. 23.5 billion, while capital

expenditure contracted by 30.7 per cent to

Rs. 19.0 billion during the year. In line with the

fuel price adjustments, railway fares for the

conveyance of passengers, goods, and mail were

revised upward with effect from 12 July 2022 after

around four years.

SLR carried out activities to develop

infrastructure and services to ensure seamless

transport facilities for passenger and freight

transportation albeit at a modest pace. However,

with the financial constraints, all maintenance and

improvement activities related to track networks,

rolling stock, and signaling and telecommunication

progressed at a slow pace. In August 2022, SLR

introduced the 'Ella Odyssey' inter-city super luxury

train that runs between Colombo and Badulla,

offering passengers one of the most scenic train

journeys in the world with great convenience, aimed

at promoting the tourism industry. The project to

rehabilitate 100 passenger coaches continued,

and 50 passenger coaches were reintroduced

into service by the end of 2022. Additionally, the

procurement of 160 passenger coaches under the

Indian credit line secured in 2017 was completed

during the year. Meanwhile, several projects related

to the rehabilitation of railway tracks, maintenance

of railway stations and bridges, extension of

platforms, and the provisioning of signaling and

telecommunication systems were underway during

the year.

Civil Aviation

The performance of the civil aviation sector

in 2022 improved with the gradual restoration

of global travel activity as the world recovered

from the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly,

passenger movements increased to 5.5 million in

2022, registering a notable year-on-year growth of

266.8 per cent, largely supported by the resumption

Construction work of several aviation

development projects was underway in 2022,

despite some hindrances caused by the

deepened economic crisis. The Airport and

Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Limited (AASL)

carried out the restructuring and remodeling

projects in the existing Passenger Terminal Building

at BIA during the year, striving towards utilising the

existing capacity effectively. Also, the construction

of the import cargo terminal building, modification to

internal and external roads at BIA, and the project

of the bonded warehouse for the electronic mall at

BIA, were on progress during the year. Moreover,

in order to ensure the orderly development of BIA,

initiatives were launched to develop a new airport

master plan to accommodate aviation demands

for the next 30 years. Meanwhile, the project of

construction of the new taxiway with an additional

apron area was completed in March 2022, under

the Colombo International Airport Ratmalana

Master Plan - Way to 2030.

The financial performance of SLA recorded

relatively less operational losses, while activity

improved somewhat, reflecting the growing

global appetite for travel. As per provisional

financial statements, the operating loss of SLA was

confined to Rs. 4.4 billion during the nine months

ending December 2022, compared to the loss of

of global travel activities as well as the low statistical

base in 2021. During the year, cargo handling

contracted by 9.3 per cent, year-on-year, to 166,969

metric tons. By end 2022, 33 international airlines

and five domestic airlines were in operation in the

country. The total number of aircraft movements

witnessed an increase of 68.2 per cent to 42,196,

with the BIA registering a significant growth of

70.7 per cent to 41,547 in aircraft movements

during the year. This was mainly facilitated by the

initiatives of the Government to attract new airlines

from Russia, Uzbekistan, the UAE, and Thailand

in support of the revival of the tourism sector.

Meanwhile, operations of several international

airlines, including Air France, Swiss International

Airline, and Alliance Air were recommenced in Sri

Lanka. Domestic air passenger transportation also

registered a substantial growth in 2022. Although

aviation activities were challenged by domestic fuel

shortages particularly in mid 2022, the Civil Aviation

Authority (CAA), together with the Government,

continued to engage closely with airlines and other

stakeholders in the industry to ensure a stable

supply of fuel for aircraft operations throughout the

year. Meanwhile, several concessions were granted

on the embarkation levy and landing and parking

charges for new airlines and existing operators to

attract more airlines to Sri Lankan airports.

Rs. 15.6 billion recorded during the corresponding

period of 2021. During the period under review,

the revenue of SLA registered a notable increase

of 222.9 per cent, while operating expenditure

increased by 176.0 per cent. With the severe

shortage of aviation fuel amidst the fuel crisis in

Sri Lanka and the subsequent CAA declaration of

non-availability of fuel for general re-fueling of

aircraft, airlines resorted to 'Tankering', and

operating via other stops for re-fueling, resulting

in high costs for operations. In view of the fiscal

burden, stemming from financial constraints of

SLA, key initiatives were taken to restructure

SLA and its subsidiary companies by handing

over a considerable number of shares and

management of the company to investors, who are

to be selected through a transparent procurement

process. Accordingly, the State Owned Enterprises

Restructuring Unit of the Ministry of Finance,

Economic Stabilisation and National Policies

was assigned to provide recommendations on

restructuring SLA.

Port Services

In 2022, port activities were adversely

affected by the moderation of import demand

amidst several restrictions and subdued

economic activity. Despite the favourable

performance observed during the first quarter of

the year, port activities recorded an overall

contraction in 2022, reflecting the impact of the

decline in domestic import volumes owing to

import restrictions and weakened international

confidence over the port operations amidst

the deepened economic crisis. Meanwhile,

the moderation in growth of global trade

volumes also weighed on the port activities

during the year. Accordingly, overall container

handling and cargo handling activities recorded

year-on-year contractions of 5.3 per cent and

8.2 per cent, respectively, while ship arrivals

also recorded a year-on-year contraction of

2.6 per cent during 2022, despite some

improvement observed towards the latter period of

the year. All the terminals of the Port of Colombo

recorded a decline in both cargo handling and

container handling. The Colombo International

Container Terminal (CICT), Sri Lanka Ports

Authority (SLPA), comprising the Jaya Container

Terminal, Unity Container Terminal, and the first

quay wall of East Container Terminal (ECT),

and South Asia Gateway Terminal (SAGT)

accounted for 46.4 per cent, 28.1 per cent, and

25.5 per cent, respectively, of the total volume of

the containers handled, and the 45.3 per cent,

28.6 per cent and 26.1 per cent, respectively,

of the transshipment containers handled at the

Port of Colombo. The total vehicle handling at

the Hambantota Port expanded during 2022 with

increased vehicle handling for transshipment

purposes amidst minimal activities related to

domestic vehicle handling. Accordingly, the total

number of vehicles handled at Hambantota Port

stood at 558,188 recording a year-on-year growth

of 13.1 per cent in 2022. During the year, vehicle

transshipment accounted for 99.8 per cent of total

vehicle handing, registering a year-on-year growth

of 13.8 per cent, while only 1,137 vehicles were

handled for domestic purposes (i.e., imports) with the

continued restrictions on motor vehicle importation.

Development of the port infrastructure and

services remained one of the major priorities

of the countryâ€™s infrastructure development

agenda. Accordingly, major development projects

related to the Port of Colombo and regional ports

continued to expand in 2022. Construction work

of the second phase of ECT was in progress

during the year and 30 per cent of work, relating

to dredging and reclamation was completed by

end 2022. Meanwhile, construction work of the

West Container Terminal (WCT) of the Colombo

Port commenced in November 2022, following the

finalisation of the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT)

agreement that spans over 35 years between a

foreign investor, a local investor and the SLPA for

the development of the project. The ECT and WCT

terminals are expected to be completed by 2025

and 2027, respectively. Upon the completion of

both terminals, the estimated annual capacity of the

Port of Colombo is expected to enhance by around

6 million TEUs, which will largely support to cater

to future demand in the port industry, enabling the

Port of Colombo to derive benefits from its strategic

geographical location. Further, a feasibility study

for the Colombo North Port Development Project

and the preliminary design and feasibility study

to implement a new Port Communication System

were also underway in 2022. In addition to the

ongoing rehabilitation work of Kankesanthurai Port

as an international commercial port, the Cabinet of

Ministers approved in September 2022 the project

to start a ferry service between Kankesanthurai

and Pondicherry in South India. In this regard,

experimental arrangements, and the Request for

Proposal (RFP) to develop the passenger terminal

progressed under a Design, Build, Operate and

Transfer (DBOT) agreement during the year.

Meanwhile, the preparation of RFP and the project

agreement under the Galle Port Development

Project, upon the completion of shortlisting of

investors was also in progress.

The financial performance of SLPA

improved in 2022 despite the overall decline

in port activities, largely driven by the

increased revenue supported by the significant

depreciation in exchange rate. The upward

revision of port charges of SLPA with effect from

01 April 2022 also partly contributed to the increase

in revenue. Further, efficiency of port activity related

to time and crane productivity of SLPA improved

significantly in 2022 over the previous year, with the

support of the terminal management system and

training initiatives of the SLPA. Accordingly, the

total revenue of SLPA increased by 50.5 per cent,

year-on-year, to Rs. 68.4 billion, while operating

expenditure has increased by 33.0 per cent to

Rs. 43.7 billion. As a result, the SLPA recorded

a profit before taxes of Rs. 57.0 billion in 2022,

compared to Rs. 25.6 billion in 2021.

Communication Services

The performance of the telecommunications

sector moderated towards the latter part of

2022, partly due to the slowdown in demand

for communication that rose during the

pandemic and subdued economic activity. The

telecommunications sector registered a robust

growth momentum during the first half of 2022,

largely driven by the continuation of online based

modalities for work, education, and other daily

activities that were adopted from the onset of the

pandemic. However, telecommunications activities

moderated towards the latter part of 2022, following

the gradual normalisation of public mobility and

the resumption of in-person work and education

activities. Meanwhile, upward adjustments in

telecommunication charges partly contributed to

the moderation in sector performance in the latter

part of 2022. Fixed line telephone connections

recorded an overall year-on-year decline of

7.0 per cent in 2022, despite the growth of 6.3

per cent registered in the first half of 2022. During

the year, mobile connections also declined by

3.7 per cent, year-on-year, and total internet

connections that comprise mobile and fixed

internet connections contracted by 2.0 per cent,

year-on-year. Fixed and mobile telephone

penetration, as measured by connections per 100

persons, stood at 12.0 and 142.0, respectively,

while internet penetration stood at 97.7 by the

end of 2022. Nevertheless, the total data usage,

which had been broadly declining since October

2021 with the removal of pandemic related mobility

restrictions, showed a gradual increase during the

year, from March 2022. Moreover, a sudden uptick

in data usage was observed in July 2022, with the

shift towards remote work and education activities,

amidst transportation disruptions caused by severe

fuel shortages.

The Government and other key stakeholder

institutions continued to engage in enhancing

the digital infrastructure base to facilitate

the envisaged digital transformation of the

economy in 2022. The Telecommunication

Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL)

was working towards enhancing island wide 4G

coverage to ensure seamless access to digital

services across the country through the 'Gamata

Sanniwedanaya' project. Although the initial plan

was to establish 276 tower sites across 10 districts

from 2021-2024, the project was rescheduled

to complete by 2026, primarily due to economic

stresses. Under this project, 38 tower sites

were completed and were on air by end 2022.

Additionally, TRCSL aims at enabling commercial

5G services by 2023. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka

became the first South Asian country to enact

comprehensive data protection legislation with the

enactment of the Personal Data Protection Act,

Agency (ICTA) implemented initiatives under

the 'National Digital Transformation Strategy'

to improve the efficiency of the service delivery

of the government institutions and to enhance

the competitiveness of the IT and BPO industry.

During the year, 23 projects were in progress under

the purview of ICTA, including the mega scale

projects of Lanka Government Network 2.0, Lanka

Government Cloud 2.0, Sri Lanka Unique Digital

Identity Framework Project, Technology Diffusion

Program, and Capacity Development for Digitally

Inclusive Sri Lanka. Additionally, ICTA provided

technical expertise for another 17 projects carried

out under the national strategy. Moreover,

registering a milestone development in the

telecommunication industry, ICTA implemented the

National Fuel Pass QR code system, in collaboration

with two other leading private sector communication

and information technology companies. The Fuel

Pass QR code system was instrumental in easing

social tensions associated with the distribution of

petroleum oil in 2022 and is expected to inspire

the transition of other public services to similar

platforms. Meanwhile, telecommunication charges

were revised upward effective from September

2022, considering the soaring operational cost

resulting from the depreciation of the exchange rate

during the year. Accordingly, the rental charges

related to data, voice, and pay-Tv connections were

increased by 20 per cent, while usage charges

remained unchanged.

The performance of the Department of Posts

(DoP) remained subdued due to disruptions

to logistical activities during 2022. The postal

services offered services through 653 main post

offices, 3,342 sub post offices, and 140 agency

post offices, covering 8,157 delivery areas island

wide. Further, DoP continued to improve its service

delivery through innovative service approaches,

while promoting and raising public awareness of

such services through social media platforms.

Accordingly, the â€˜Cash on Deliveryâ€™ services, which

were relaunched in 2020, registered a notable

income of Rs. 269.0 million in 2022, compared

to the income of Rs. 34.0 million recorded in

2021. After a hiatus of over four years, domestic

postage rates were revised upward in August 2022

along with the revision to foreign postage rates

compatible with cost escalations in logistics related

to postal services. Accordingly, the minimum

postage fee applicable for the Domestic Normal Note: 1 Petabyte (PB) = 1 million Gigabytes (GB)

Post service and the minimum registration fee

increased by Rs. 35.00 and Rs.30.00, respectively,

to Rs. 50.00 and Rs.60.00, respectively, while most

of the fees applicable to other postal services were

raised upwards during the year. Despite these

developments, the overall financial position of DoP

remained weak in 2022. As per the provisional

financial statements of DoP, though revenue

increased by 29.6 per cent to Rs. 9.3 billion,

higher operating expenditure, which increased by

15.3 per cent to Rs. 16.1 billion, resulted in an

operating loss of Rs. 7.0 billion in 2022, compared

to the loss of Rs. 7.2 billion in 2021. Besides the

regular postal fare revision mechanisms to enhance

the financial viability of DoP, considering the

evolving consumer needs of the postal service of

the country, DoP requires extensive modernisation

that leverages modern technology, innovation,

and customer centric approaches in the form of

service automation, online services, 'point to point

tracking', and pickup services through expanded

service diversity, among others.

Water Supply and Irrigation

The National Water Supply and Drainage

Board (NWS&DB) expanded its services in

providing safe and sustainable water to meet

the growing demand for pipe borne water

during 2022. With the provisioning of 153,217

new water supply connections, the total number of

connections administered by NWS&DB increased

to 2.9 million during the year. Accordingly, the

percentage of the population with access to safe

drinking water increased to 96.0 per cent in 2022

from 94.4 per cent in 2021, while the total pipe

borne water coverage stood at 60.4 per cent of

the households in 2022. Further, the proportion

of non-revenue water usage of the country

declined marginally to 25.2 per cent in 2022 from

25.8 per cent in 2021. During the year, the water

supply development initiatives of NWS&DB were

hindered by the financial constraints and the

macroeconomic instabilities, resulting in the slow

pace of progress in NWS&DBâ€™s development

projects. The flagship development project of

NWS&DB, 'Water for All', aimed at increasing

the pipe borne water coverage of Sri Lanka to

79 per cent by 2025, was discontinued in 2022

with the approval of Cabinet Ministers. Instead,

the 'Capacity Enhancements and Distribution

Expansion' project was initiated during the year with

the aim of enhancing the capacity of existing water

supply schemes as well as distribution expansion.

Meanwhile, the Greater Matale Water Supply

project, which commenced in 2017, was completed

during the year, providing safe drinking water to

90,000 families in the city of Matale and its environs,

while the Galle Cluster Project and Project I of

the Colombo Water Supply Service Improvement

Projects were also completed in 2022. Additionally,

the Alawwa, Polgahawela, Pothuhara Integrated

Water Supply Project and Matara Water Supply

Project-stage IV, achieved a physical progress

of 94.0 per cent and 93.1 per cent, respectively,

in 2022, while both projects are expected to

be completed in 2023. Upon completion, these

projects will improve safe drinking water facilities

in 20 Divisional Secretariates in the Southern and

North Western Provinces. Moreover, the Water

Supply and Sanitation project, covering Jaffna and

Kilinochchi Districts, which aims to fulfill the water

requirement of 300,000 beneficiaries in these

two districts, registered a physical progress of

71.4 per cent by the end of 2022. Nevertheless,

several other water supply projects were temporarily

suspended, while expected completion timelines

for around ten major water supply projects were

extended due to the slow pace of progress during

the year amidst financial headwinds.

The upward revision of water and sewerage

tariffs in 2022 after a 10 year hiatus helped

strengthen the financial performance of

NWS&DB. Considering the rising cost of supplying

water and maintaining water infrastructure in the

country, and the resultant financial losses incurred

by NWS&DB in the absence of regular revisions

to water tariffs, the Cabinet of Ministers granted

approval for the upward revision of water and

sewerage tariffs with effect from 01 September

2022. Accordingly, the tiered water tariff system for

all categories of users was substantially increased

with usage tariffs for the domestic category

being raised by around 70.0 per cent. However,

tariffs applicable to low income consumers,

such as Samurdhi recipients, remained broadly

unchanged alongside those tariff rates applicable

to the schools, religious, and charitable institutions

categories. Further, fees applicable for new water

connections were also revised upward with effect

from 17 October 2022. Partly attributing to these

revisions, the operating loss of NWS&DB declined

to Rs. 1.2 billion in 2022, compared to the loss

of Rs. 3.1 billion recorded in the previous year.

Going forward, it is vital that water tariffs undergo a

process of revision at regularly scheduled intervals,

thereby ensuring the sustainability of countryâ€™s

water supply and sanitation system to preserve the

health and wellbeing of people in the long run.

The Department of Irrigation (DI) continued

its efforts towards maintaining and upgrading

irrigation projects for agriculture and domestic

purposes in 2022. During the year, DI progressed

19 major irrigation projects incurring a total cost

of Rs. 3.8 billion, of which Rs. 2.0 billion and

Rs. 616.3 million were spent on the Uma Oya

downstream development project and Yan Oya

project, respectively. The Uma Oya downstream

development project, achieved a physical progress

of 74.1 per cent by end of 2022. Incurring a cost of

Rs. 1.1 billion during the year, the 'Warisaubhagya

National Programme', was in progress in an effort

to enhancing irrigable land area through the

rehabilitation and enhancing capacities of tanks

and anicuts across all districts for the benefit of

around 250,000 families. Under this programme,

rehabilitation of 598 tanks were completed by

end of 2022, compared to the 739 tanks/anicuts

considered as per the initial plan. Further,

activities related to the physical work of several

medium scale irrigation projects, including the

Peramaduwa Reservoir project and rehabilitation

works of the Padaviya and Wahalkada schemes,

were commenced in 2022. Meanwhile, the

'Productivity Enhancement and Irrigation System

Efficiency Improvement Project' (PIESIP) that was

commenced in 2017 aimed at improving irrigation

system efficiencies to enhance land, water, and

country continued during the year, albeit at a slow

phase amidst restrained budgetary allocations.

3.3 Social Infrastructure Policies, Institutional Framework and Performance

Health

Healthcare provisioning of the country

continued to straddle with contemporary

challenges during 2022. Notwithstanding

the surge in COVID-19 cases recorded in the

first quarter of 2022, the severity of the spread

eventually dissipated towards the second half of

the year. With the spread of the Omicron variant

towards end 2021, the number of COVID-19

cases showed a steady increase up until end

April 2022 and followed a gradual decline by July

2022. Thereafter, transmission of the sub-variant

Omicron.BA.5, known to be the most contagious

and most immune evasive strain, intensified in mid

July 2022 before dissipating towards end 2022.

According to the Ministry of Health (MoH), as of

mid March 2023, 672,048 cases of COVID-19

were reported, while the death toll was 16,831. The

caseload and deaths reported in Sri Lanka were

comparatively low, compared to peer countries,

implying the successful execution of preventive

and containment strategies in controlling the virus

spread. Mobility restrictions and social distancing

measures together with the rapid deployment

of vaccine drive across the island helped the

country to deal with multiple outbreaks. As of mid

March 2023, the national vaccine administrative

programme has effectively covered 97.1 per cent

of the population, over the age of 12 years having

received at least one dose and 83.6 per cent

having received the initial protocol of two vaccine

doses. Of the initial protocol completed population,

55.7 per cent received the first booster dose and

2.5 per cent of the first booster dose completed

population received the second booster dose, by

mid-March 2023. The administration of the second

booster dose of the Pfizer vaccine began in May

2022 in phases, prioritising the elderly population

and immunocompromised individuals before

the general public. However, the progress in

administering the second booster dose of vaccines

continued lagging by end 2022, partly reflecting

subdued public preferences for the booster

vaccination. Despite the successful containment of

the COVID-19 pandemic through concerted efforts

of all the stakeholders, any resurgence of such

health emergencies in the period ahead would

exert pressures on the healthcare system, which

is already strangled in a precarious state due to

shortages in medical supplies and medicines

attributable to issues in procurement procedures.

Going forward, recognising the need for enhancing

the resilience of the countryâ€™s healthcare system,

measures should be deployed in strengthening its

readiness to exogenous shocks by fostering private

sector investments in the health sector on top of

government investment in health infrastructure,

while streamlining and automating healthcare

procurement processes.

The healthcare system was burdened with

the countryâ€™s exposure to the spread of other

communicable diseases during 2022. The

number of dengue cases intensified substantially to

76,689 from 35,924 cases reported in the previous

year, whereas dengue related deaths increased to

72 from 28 deaths in 2021. The highest number of

cases was reported in the districts of Colombo and

Gampaha, where the risk of spread of dengue was

substantial due to high population density. The rise

in dengue cases in 2022 was largely attributable

to lapses in executing dengue preventive

measures due to shortages in pesticides and

fuel. Prolongation of such shortages may cause

continuity of the upward trend in dengue infestation

in early 2023. Although Sri Lanka was affirmed

to have eliminated filariasis as a public health

problem by the World Health Organisation (WHO)

in 2016, approximately 73 cases of filariasis were

reported in 2022. The countryâ€™s filariasis control

programme is in the post-validation surveillance

phase, where the target is set to completely prevent

the transmission of the disease by 2030. In 2022,

6,970 leptospirosis cases were reported compared

to 6,946 cases recorded in 2021, while the highest

caseloads were reported from Rathnapura, Kegalle,

Galle, and Kalutara districts. Despite the fact that

Sri Lanka was declared malaria free by WHO in

2016, 37 imported malaria cases were reported

in 2022, compared to 26 in 2021, as a result of

increased cross border transmission following the

relaxation of COVID-19 related restrictions, raising

concerns over a plausible resurgence of malaria in

the country.

The health sector continued to grapple

challenges emanating from Non-Communicable

Diseases (NCDs) amidst exacerbated socio-

economic issues. A steady rise in NCDs has

been observed in the country over the last

few years, due to lifestyle risk factors, such as

unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, smoking, alcohol

and drug consumption, and deterioration of mental

health. The MoH continued its engagement

in promoting public awareness with regard to

prevention, diagnosis, control, and management of

NCDs. Accordingly, a revised National Policy and

Strategic Framework for Prevention and Control

of NCDs in Sri Lanka was published for public

comment, while the Multi Sectoral Strategic Action

Plan on Injury Prevention and Management, Sri

Lanka 2021â€“2025 was launched in 2022 to provide

strategic leadership for injury prevention through

targeted planning and service coordination. Several

physical activity promotion programmes and

healthy diet programmes were conducted with the

aim of reducing the incidence of NCDs, especially

targeting the youth population. Further, MoH

continued to engage in cancer control activities at

the primary care level, including early detection and

prevention. Accordingly, a cancer early detection

centre became operational during the year at the

Rathnapura teaching hospital. Nevertheless, amidst

reduced availability of medical and pharmaceutical

supplies in the country, continuing treatment for

NCD patients proved to be challenging, creating a

disproportionate bearing on vulnerable groups of the

population. Against this backdrop, there is a dire need

to prioritise the requisites for health emergencies

and adequate provisioning of budgetary allocation,

Introduction

Rising malnutrition among children has become a forefront policy concern in Sri Lanka amidst heightened food insecurity of households caused by the host of economic and social issues that exacerbated during the economic crisis in 2022. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), malnutrition refers to deficiencies or excesses in nutrient intake, imbalance of essential nutrients, or impaired nutrient utilisation. Thus, it entails a double burden of undernutrition and overnutrition. Undernutrition occurs in the form of wasting (low weight for height), stunting (low height for age), being underweight (low weight for age), and micronutrient deficiencies. Overnutrition is a health risk, which develops along with abnormal or excessive fat accumulation in the human body that can result in overweight and ultimately obesity concerns. Malnutrition among the population is perceived as a growth regressive factor, with its direct influences on human capital productivity and intergenerational impact on human capital augmentation in the long run. According to the report on State of Food and Agriculture (2013) by Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, malnutrition imposes a global social and economic burden of an estimated US dollars 3.5 trillion annually, which is approximately equivalent to US dollars 500 per person, per annum. Given the critical role of human capital in economic growth, the issue of malnutrition has gained significant global attention, resulting in the implementation of a plethora of policy measures aimed at combatting it across the world. Sri Lanka adopted its first National Nutritional Policy (NNP) in 1986 and carried out numerous nutrition schemes to reduce malnutrition and improve the nutritional status of the population. Despite the improved status of human development indicators, the progress made in combatting child malnutrition has remained stagnant for several decades, underlining the flaws of nutrition interventions and persistent income inequalities within the economy. Against this backdrop, food security and nutrition anomalies of the population have been further exacerbated by the pandemic and thereafter by the worsened economic crisis via many channels, including surging food prices, supply chain disruptions caused by the energy crisis, shortages in food commodities, loss of livelihood and the decline in disposable income, among others.

Child Malnutrition Status of Sri Lanka Prior to the Economic Crisis in 2022

Since independence, Sri Lanka has embarked on numerous initiatives to enhance the socio-economic wellbeing of citizens via numerous programmes on food security, nutrition, safety net schemes, etc. They

BOX 5Fighting Child Malnutrition in Sri Lanka amidst the Economic Crisis

include provisioning of school meals, provisioning of food/cash allowances for pregnant and lactating mothers, the Thriposha programme, school water sanitation and hygiene programmes, and the salt iodisation programme, among others. Reflecting the impact of these efforts and commitments spanning over several decades, malnutrition among children declined remarkably during the period from 1975 to 1995, with stunting among children below five years of age almost halved to 26.1 per cent in 1995, compared to 49.9 per cent in 1975, while the underweight child population declined to 29.3 per cent in 1995 from 57.3 per cent in 1975. However, the progress towards alleviating malnutrition has moderated over the last few decades. According to the latest Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) - 2016, prevalence of wasting in children under five years remained at 15.1 per cent, reaching the emergency threshold level of wasting among children. Also, the prevalence of wasting among children under five years showed no significant progress in the survey rounds since 1995/96 to the 2016 period. According to the World Bank statistics, Sri Lanka ranked the second worst affected country in the South Asian region in terms of wasting among children under five years. Further, underweight among the same group of children remains around 20.0 per cent since 2000, while no significant advancement was reported in terms of children with stunted growth.

Meanwhile, the persistent disparities in malnutrition prevalence across regions and economic sectors in the country suggest that nutrition anomalies remain unresolved for a prolonged period. Across residential sectors, the estate sector has become the most vulnerable sector with the highest prevalence in stunting and underweight children under five years. According to the DHS-2016, around 31.7 per cent of children in the estate sector are stunted, compared to 14.7 per cent in urban areas and 17.0 per cent in rural sector. Further, 29.7

per cent of children under five years in the estate sector were underweight. Across districts, the highest prevalence of underweight and stunted children under five years was reported in Nuwara Eliya. The spatial disparities in nutritional status are primarily attributable to the socio-economic factors, such as economic security, access to health and education, connectivity, infrastructure development, etc. For instance, the motherâ€™s education level has been recognised as a major factor that influences the nutritional status of children. As such, the prevalence of stunting and underweight children born to mothers with no formal education is as high as 37.6 per cent and 33.9 per cent, respectively, compared to those of 12.1 per cent and 10.0 per cent reported, respectively, of children born to mothers with educational qualifications of degree or above. The Child Multidimensional Poverty Indicator (CMPI) of Sri Lanka, which is based on Household Income and Expenditure Survey-2019, signifies that one third of children aged 0-4 years are multidimensionally poor and either underweight or stunted. Meanwhile, the Sustainable Development Report 2022 (Sachs. J. et al., 2022) shows that Sri Lanka is lagging behind in progressing towards the zero hunger target by 2030, as reflected by moderate improvements in hunger indicators, which remained insufficient to attain the Sustainable Development Goals targets as envisaged.

Impact of the Current Economic Crisis on the Nutritional Status of Children

The UNICEF conceptual framework for malnutrition,1

identifies economic factors as one of the major primary underlying causes of malnutrition, which could have a detrimental impact on the nutritional status of the population. Turbulent economic conditions can particularly disrupt supply channels and food systems, as well as means of income of the people, thereby directly impacting the nutritional well-being of the population by reducing householdsâ€™ access to and the affordability of nutritious food. Economic shocks often drive marginalised population to prioritise consumption of calorie-rich but nutrient-poor food, leading to a deterioration in dietary quality and eventually resulting in increased malnutrition.

Sri Lanka exemplifies how its worst economic recession on record and the resulting heightened macroeconomic instabilities have created unprecedented and far reaching social and economic consequences, of which deterioration in nutritional wellbeing of the population,

particularly child malnutrition represents a deep concern that carries a generational burden. With the crisis induced supply chain disruptions and higher cost coupled with drop in domestic food production due to acute fertiliser shortages, food prices in Sri Lanka started to escalate since the latter part of 2021, recording the historically highest food inflation (CCPI) of 94.9 per cent in September 2022, compared to 9.2 per cent at end 2020 and 22.1 per cent at end 2021. Despite some deceleration observed in food inflation since the latter part of 2022, food prices remained elevated during 2022. The surge in inflation caused a significant deterioration in the real income of households, while loss of livelihoods, particularly in the informal sector due to the crisis has exacerbated the household burden. With the informal sector accounting for 58.4 per cent of employment and a poverty level of 14.3 per cent, the potential consequences of economic turmoil on livelihoods, food security, and nutritional status remain significant. This compels households to adopt alternative coping strategies during the crisis.

According to the Remote Household Food Security Survey of the World Food Programme (WFP), which consists of 2,137 surveys across all nine provinces conducted through a computer assisted telephone interviewing data collection approach, the food security status of the country remained vulnerable as at end 2022, with 68.0 per cent of the population adopting food based coping strategies by limiting portion sizes, reducing the number of meals, and relying on less preferred food. Meanwhile, a portion of population of around 40 per cent has resorted to livelihood based coping strategies by reducing their spending on education and health, which could eventually lead to deterioration in long term nutritional conditions and wellbeing. The latest official assessment of the Family Health Bureau of Ministry of Health that was conducted under the concept of Nutrition Month in October 2022 on nutritional status of children under five years, reveals that the nutritional status of children deteriorated in 2022 reflecting the decline in household wellbeing during the economic crisis. The assessment results indicate a worsening in all major nutrition indicators for children, particularly, stunting, wasting, and underweight in the under five-year age category. At the national level, the percentage of underweight children under five years increased to 15.3 per cent in 2022 from 12.2 per cent in 2021. Both stunting and wasting among children under five years increased to 9.2 per cent and 10.1 per cent, respectively, in 2022, from 7.4 per cent and 8.2 per cent, respectively, recorded in 2021. However, the percentage of overweight children showed some improvement in 2022.

1. The immediate causes of malnutrition are poor dietary intake (quality/quantity), physical inactivity and disease conditions, while household food insecurity, inadequate care for children and women, sub-optimal health service delivery and sedentary lifestyle and behaviours are considered underlying causes of malnutrition. The basic causes of malnutrition are socio-cultural, economic, and political factors as well as climate variability and weather extremes. These factors could affect both availability and affordability of food.

According to the Survey, child malnutrition has deteriorated in most districts, exacerbating the existing nutrition anomalies among children across the country. The Nuwara Eliya District had the highest percentage of stunted children, with a reported percentage of 22.8 per cent, while the Colombo District had the lowest percentage of stunted children of 5.1 per cent. Further, the Nuwara Eliya District reported the highest percentage of underweight children under the age of five, at 23.9 per cent, while the Colombo District had the lowest percentage of underweight children at 9.8 per cent. It is apparent that nutrition anomalies in the country have been persisted despite government intervention efforts, and these inequalities are likely to worsen during economic crises unless addressed cohesively.

The Governmentâ€™s Responses

To combat the devastating effects of the economic and food crisis on the nutritional status of the population and prevent further deterioration of malnutrition conditions, the Emergency Nutrition Plan for 2022-2024 was developed by the Ministry of Health. The plan aims at addressing critical issues, such as food availability and affordability inequalities, gaps in health system services for vulnerable groups, and communication and empowerment gaps to prevent nutritional problems. Accordingly, all the stakeholders are involved in planning and implementing identified strategies and key activities of the plan, while also monitoring progress at each level of implementation. Meanwhile, several financial assistance programmes were implemented by the Government targeting vulnerable populations, including low income pregnant mothers, lactating mothers, women headed families, children under five years, and people suffering from malnutrition with the assistance of the international agencies. These programmes were aimed at ensuring food security for households, while measures were taken to continue the provisioning of balanced meals to school children through school meal programmes. Meanwhile, provisioning of supplementary therapeutic food for severely malnourished children continues, along with other health services provided through the Family Health Bureau.

Policy Agenda to Combat Child Malnutrition

Policy initiatives taken by successive governments to combat child malnutrition have been insufficient to withstand sudden socio-economic shocks. This underscores the need for reformulating strategies aimed at preserving food security and alleviating malnutrition within a multisectoral framework. In this regard, policies should be formulated as short run, and medium to long run solutions, while addressing the gaps in the existing nutrition programmes. Short run solutions should be targeted at compensating for the negative income impact due to the surge in food prices, such as providing safety nets and scaling up of existing social protection programmes, while ensuring better targeting of these welfare benefits with proper exit mechanisms, to achieve the desired outcomes. Given the limited fiscal space for government led nutrition interventions, it is crucial to extensively seek avenues for food assistance from donor agencies and peer countries to reduce hunger among vulnerable sectors in the near term, while ensuring the monitoring and evaluation of such programmes transparently. Encouraging community-based programmes, such as â€˜community kitchensâ€™, could be beneficial as such movements offer a common platform

to address a wide range of causes of undernutrition. As indicated in the UNICEF system approach to improve maternal and child nutrition, the long term strategies to combat child malnutrition must be grounded on five systems: food system, health system, water and sanitation system, education system, and social protection system. Accordingly, reforms and investments in food systems, which deliver availability and affordability of nutritious and safe food in a sustainable manner are vital, while enabling better food choices for families. In this regard, notable transformations in a countryâ€™s food system are essential to deliver a healthy diet for people at an affordable price. These include improving productivity in the agriculture sector along with more innovations and research and development, reducing post-harvest losses, more value addition in the agriculture sector, reducing import dependency of food systems, introducing climate resilient food crops, promoting a wide range of nutrient rich foods, particularly through the popularising integrated farming, rebalancing agriculture sector subsidies, and tax policies and improving agronomic practices as well as maintaining adequate food buffers to face food emergencies.

The health system should be improved to play its role as a delivery platform for prevention and treatment of malnutrition, in addition to contributing towards fostering positive nutrition practices among the public. In this regard, it is needed to encourage new investments in basic health and nutrition services with a view to expanding access to such services, while introducing a basic nutrition package for the most underprivileged community. Further, investing in education, particularly targeting the vulnerable population, remains crucial, as education and malnutrition show a strong inverse relationship. Investing in womenâ€™s education plays a vital role in determining childrenâ€™s nutrition levels, where income opportunities for women created through education help support the nutrition vulnerability of households.

Considering the far reaching socio-economic consequences of renewed threats of child malnutrition amidst the crisis, policy makers should focus on reformulating strategies spanning from short run and medium to long run to combat malnutrition among children in Sri Lanka. In this regard, collective and coordinated efforts of all the stakeholders of the economy, particularly the Government, health systems, education systems, and participants in the food systems along with the support from all the citizens of the country remain important in transforming policies to actions, thereby supporting to uplift the nutritional conditions of the children. These concerted efforts can strengthen the linkages between stakeholders in formulating nutrition strategies, strengthening capacities of existing nutrition programmes and mobilising funds for such initiatives, while enabling a data centric evidence based decision making process to secure childrenâ€™s right to nutrition.

while fostering investments in domestic production

of drugs and other medical supplies and improving

efficiency in the healthcare system in the country to

promote the wellbeing of its citizens.

Several infrastructure developments and

capacity building initiatives aimed at improving

the quality of healthcare services were

underway in 2022. Accordingly, primary healthcare

delivery facilities were developed and strengthened

in five hospitals using the funds allocated by the

World Bank under the Primary Healthcare System

Strengthening Project to provide quality services

through primary medical care institutions. In 2022,

the establishment of accident and emergency care

services in selected hospitals, including District

General Hospitals in Kalutara and Ampara, was

in progress. Further, various projects aimed at

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

130

upgrading accident and emergency care units of

the government hospitals, such as Ratnapura,

Karapitiya, and Monaragala hospitals, were in

progress. Additionally, the construction of a national

simulation centre at the Mulleriyawa Base Hospital

as a national centre for stroke care was underway

during 2022. Meanwhile, programmes targeted

at building human capital capacity in the health

sector were continued. Considering the shortage in

high skilled professionals in the health sector, as

an interim policy provision, the retirement age for

medical consultants, government medical officers,

dental surgeons, and registered medical officers

was extended by one more year with effect from

12 December 2022 for which the policy validity will

remain up until 31 December 2023. In addition,

the Government decided to allow public servants,

including health sector employees, to avail five

years of no pay leave for employment abroad.

Nevertheless, the emerging trends in high skilled

labour migration from the health sector amidst the

economic crisis could have severe implications

in continuing public health services in the period

ahead, suggesting immediate policy response to

retain the high skilled medical professionals and

consultants within the country.

The private sector continued to play a

significant role in healthcare delivery in both

preventive and curative services in Sri Lanka.

The number of registered private hospitals stood at

250 by end 2022 with a total bed capacity of 5,602,

while six new full time private general practices/

dispensaries/medical clinics were established

during the year. Complementing efforts of the

Government to contain the COVID-19 outbreak,

25 Intermediary Care Centres and three COVID-19

treatment centres were operated by private

hospitals with the approval of MoH, and 13 private

laboratories were authorised to conduct PCR and

Rapid Antigen Tests in 2022. Given the limitations

in the regular health services provided by public

hospitals amidst the medical supply shortages,

a majority of people opted for services provided

by private hospitals during 2022. However, with

the higher cost of medical supplies, medicines,

laboratory tests, and consultation fees, the charges

of such medical services rose sharply to excessive

amounts, reflecting the flaws in the existing

regulatory mechanisms for private healthcare

providers. As a result, individuals, especially

middle income earners, were seen to opt out of

their ordinary access to private healthcare facilities.

In this context, policies targeted at strengthening

the regulation of the private sector and streamlining

accreditation policies related to private healthcare

service providers remain vital to widen the private

healthcare sector to complement public healthcare

provisioning, without compromising the benefits

of providing public healthcare services largely for

marginalised groups to ensure equitable access to

health by all.

Education

Education activities were gradually revived

towards the second half of 2022 with the

abatement of energy crisis induced disruptions

and COVID-19 interferences on the education

system. Despite the resumption of in-person

academic activities at the beginning of 2022,

following the intermittent closures of schools,

universities, and other education centres since

2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, educational

activities were once again hampered in the early

part of the second quarter of 2022, owing to

transportation difficulties arising from severe

shortages in domestic fuel supplies. Amidst

the transportation difficulties witnessed across

the country, academic activities were shifted

towards online platforms in mid June 2022.

However, these online education systems were

also adversely affected by the regular power

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

131

outages that the country experienced during

the year. With some resolution of the issues

pertaining to the fuel supply, educational

activities gradually recovered towards the second

half of 2022, allowing the commencement of

in-person academic activities on a full time basis

since August 2022. Although in-person academic

activities resumed during the year, learning losses

caused by intermittent disruptions to academic

activities since 2020 continued to persist. These

disruptions are likely to create far reaching adverse

consequences on learning outcomes, thereby

widening the inequalities in educational outcomes

among children in different economic and social

backgrounds and geographical locations, given the

already existing disparities in access to education

infrastructure and technology related infrastructure

facilities. As per the assessment on achievement

levels of foundational skills in literacy and

numeracy of grade 03 students in Sri Lanka which

was conducted by the Ministry of Education (MoE)

during the period of 2021-2022, the percentage

of students who achieved every foundational

skills in literacy remained only around 6 per cent

of the sample, while the percentage of student who

achieved all the skills in numeracy also remained

low at 7 per cent. Furthermore, prolonged school

closures following the COVID-19 outbreak and the

spillover effects of the unprecedented economic

crisis in the country led to an increase in school

dropouts among vulnerable households. According

to the latest available data for 2020, school dropouts

in the primary sector increased to 9,269 from 8,834

in 2019. In this context, school dropouts are likely

to have further increased in 2022, as vulnerable

households opted to cut education expenses as

a coping strategy amidst the economic distress.

Meanwhile, children from low income households

faced further difficulties due to shortages of

stationery and school supplies, and soaring prices

of such items caused by galloping inflation amidst

the financial hardships of households during 2022,

indicating the possible risks of widening inequalities

in learning outcomes. On the other hand, the

postponement of national level examinations,

instead of adopting alternative methods of

assessment and adjusting significant compromises

on syllabi, hinders the timely assessment of

academic progress of students in the short run

and highlights concern about the development of

a productive human capital base of the country

in the long run. Given the persistent nature of the

difficulties students has been experiencing over the

past three years, future policies should be adjusted

with due consideration given to the impact of the

disruptions on the learning outcomes of students

at all levels within the public education system

and lifelong implications of these disruptions

in terms of pursuing higher education and

employment opportunities. Therefore, a concerted

effort is required to enhance the quality of online

learning outcomes and infrastructure base, novel

assessment methods, and upgradability of syllabi to

upskill the labour force, across all education levels,

while aligning them with the sectoral priorities of

the country.

In 2022, several initiatives were undertaken

to improve equitable access to general

education and to enhance quality, governance,

and service delivery of education services in

Sri Lanka. During the year, MoE together with

the relevant stakeholders continued to review the

current education system aiming at implementing

the curriculum and learning reforms, identifying

future learning needs, providing assistance to

recover learning losses and acquiring the essential

learning competencies, as well as standardising the

teacher development process, thereby uplifting the

quality in general education in the period ahead.

The National Institute of Education (NIE) continued

to work on new curriculum reforms, which are

expected to be launched as a pilot project in

selected schools for Grades 1, 6, and 10 students

in 2024. Other initiatives, such as the 'New National

School Development Programme' and the 'Nearest

School is the Best School' project were also

underway. The '13-Years Mandatory Education'

policy was further strengthened in 2022 with the

offering of the Vocational stream for Advanced

Level studies in 525 schools nationwide. In 2022,

about 8,000 students who had been undertaking

studies under Vocational stream were directed to

institutional training, while initiatives were taken

to get the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers to

establish the vocational education stream as the

seventh Advanced Level education stream during

the year. Meanwhile, MoE continued to facilitate

academic activities through a blended learning

approach as required amidst the interruptions to

in-person education activities during the year with

the continuation of online programmes that were in

place since 2021. MoE conducted the 'Improving

and Assessing of Listening and Speaking Skills'

training programme via the 'Moodle' platform to

uplift proficiency in the English language and trained

around 150 trainers as well as English teachers

across the country in 2022. Activities aimed at

developing proficiency in foreign languages, such

as German and French, were uploaded to MoE's

'e-thaksalawa' learning management system

during the year. The Government managed to hold

all national level examinations that were due in

2021 during the first half of 2022, while the Grade

5 Scholarship Examination and Advanced Level

Examination due in August 2022 were postponed

to December 2022 and January 2023, respectively.

The Ordinary Level Examination, which was due in

December 2022, is planned to be held in May 2023

without any significant compromises.

The higher education sector strived to ensure

the continuity of education activities by resorting

to hybrid mechanisms in 2022, while several

measures were undertaken to strengthen the

higher education infrastructure base of the

country. During the year, the state universities

carried out their education activities, continuing the

learning mode adopted under the online platform of

Lanka Education and Research Network (LEARN),

which was established since the onset of the

COVID-19 pandemic, combined with the in-person

education activities, thereby minimising the adverse

consequences of economic disruptions on the higher

education sector. While ensuring the continuity

of education activities, authorities committed to

enhance the education infrastructure base, despite

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

133

the financial constraints imposed by the economic

crisis. Accordingly, approval for two new faculties of

computing at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura

and Sabaragamuwa University, and a faculty of

graduate studies in the Eastern University was

granted by the University Grants Commission

(UGC) during the year, while 14 new departments

in eight universities were also approved. Moreover,

around 54 new degree programmes, covering

undergraduate degree programmes, undergraduate

specialisation degree programmes, postgraduate

degree programmes, and external degree

programmes, were approved in 2022. Meanwhile,

measures were taken to introduce the University

Test of English Language (UTEL), a national level

test administered under the guidance of UGC for

third-year students in all the universities during the

year. A national level certificate is planned to be

offered upon the completion of this examination.

In addition, UGC initiated a project to establish

separate Departments of Information Technology

in the Faculties of Humanities, Arts, and Performing

Arts in universities aimed at enhancing the future

employability of undergraduates in the streams of

Arts, Humanities, and Aesthetics.

In 2022, the private sector played an

important role in providing tertiary education to

meet the dynamic demand of the labour market.

By end 2022, there were 24 Non-State Higher

Education Institutes (NSHEIs) recognised by the

Non-State Higher Education Division of MoE as

degree awarding institutes, offering 221 accredited

degree programmes. During the year, one new

institute was recognised as a degree-awarding

institute, and 34 new degree programmes offered

by NSHEIs were also recognised. Meanwhile,

reviews of several new degree programmes and

new institutions were underway during 2022.

The preparation of guidelines for ascertaining

the minimum standards for Degree Awarding

Institutions and subject review of NSHEIs were

completed during the year.

The Technical and Vocational Education and

Training (TVET) sector continued to enhance

opportunities to cater to the contemporary

skill needs of the economy. By the end of 2022,

there were 1,136 registered institutions in the

TVET sector, comprising of 526 public institutions

and 610 non-government sector institutions.

These institutions offered 3,043 accredited TVET

courses covering various technical and vocational

subject areas. During the year, 117,954 National

Vocational Qualification (NVQ) certificates were

awarded to qualifying students. Despite the

constraints imposed by the economic crisis, the

Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission

(TVEC) continued to adopt several measures

to facilitate training delivery, assessment, and

certification activities. Most training institutes

continued to use blended education modalities, and

the Flexible Learning Method (FLM) was promoted

to reduce time, the financial cost of travelling, cost of

accommodation, and cost of logistics arrangements.

Meanwhile, the Governing Council of the TVEC

granted coverup approvals of training institutes

offering caregiver training courses to expedite the

registration process, acknowledging the fast growing

nature of the caregiver sector in the global job

market. Additionally, the TVEC issued NVQ Circular

05/2022, facilitating On-the-Job Training (OJT)

for several NVQ levels starting from 01 November

2022, providing faster adaptation to prospective

employment opportunities.

Housing and Urban Development

The progress in housing development

projects of the Government remained stagnant

in 2022, reflecting the impact of tight fiscal space

and supply shortages in raw materials as well as

the surge in cost of inputs in the construction

sector during the year. The preliminary work of

the Middle Income Housing Projects planned to be

implemented under the Public Private Partnership

(PPP) arrangement was carried out by the Urban

Settlement Development Authority (USDA) during

the year. However, four major projects under USDA,

including the Wattala and Nittambuwa middle

income housing projects and Mixed Development

Projects of Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte and

Kaduwela, were discontinued in 2022 due to

cashflow pressures of the Government, while

the planned Low Income Housing Projects in

Hikkaduwa and Nawalapitiya were also halted

due to budgetary constraints. Nevertheless, the

Ministry of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure

Development continued several housing projects

with financial assistance from the Government of

India to improve the living conditions of the estate

population, while several Government funded

projects of a similar nature were also underway

during the year. Meanwhile, the development

activities pertaining to the housing projects of 'Obata

Geyak â€“ Ratata Hetak', 'Mihindu Niwahana', and

'Viru Sumithuru' continued at a moderate pace.

The Governmentâ€™s infrastructure projects

continued to progress at a slower pace in 2022

amidst the financial constraints associated

with the deepened economic crisis. The

Urban Development Authority (UDA) continued

to engage in around 180 projects under the

Urban Infrastructure and Township Development

Programme (Siyak Nagara), including city

beautification and urban development endeavours,

to enhance the infrastructure base of the country.

Under the programme to develop five roads in the

Homagama Tech City, a new access road from

Kottawa to Mahenwatta was completed during

the year. Several other key projects, including the

Beira Lake Rehabilitation and Redevelopment

Project, and the Reconstruction of Jaffna Town Hall

were also underway during 2022. Development

activities related to the Metro Colombo Solid Waste

Management Project also continued during the year,

achieving cumulative physical progress of 90.0

per cent at end 2022. Further, the Metro Colombo

Urban Development Project, which is targeted

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

135

at addressing the issue of urban flooding and

developing the Colombo metropolitan area into a

world class city, recorded a physical progress of

99.6 per cent by end 2022. Further, after completion

of the construction work, the Colombo Lotus

Tower was handed over to the Government on

28 February 2022, and accordingly the operations

were entrusted to the Colombo Lotus Tower (Pvt.)

Ltd, a company established under the Ministry

of Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National

Policies. The Colombo Lotus Tower was opened

for public viewing from mid September 2022, and

negotiations are underway with several private

investors to develop an entertainment zone within

the premises.

Activities pertaining to the development of

Colombo Port City continued in 2022, achieving

many milestones. Accordingly, Development

Control Regulations (DCR) for the entire project

were gazetted in April 2022, and the key

regulations in relation to businesses of strategic

importance, offshore companies, authorised

persons, and duty-free retail operations were

finalised in 2022. However, considering the

importance of establishing a world class university

and an international school in the Port City,

measures were taken to revise the DCR during

the latter part of 2022. Infrastructure development

of the regionâ€™s first Downtown Duty Free Mall

was completed, and the Port Cityâ€™s Duty Free

Passenger entry system was also being developed,

and is planned to be launched in mid 2023. Land

preparation and technical preparation of 42 plots

out of the 74 plots were concluded by the Colombo

Port City project company, enabling the Colombo

Port City Economic Commission (CPCEC) to issue

completion certificates to the project company,

while six plots in the Marina District of Colombo

Port City were sold during the year. Licenses for

four banks, including two state owned banks, were

granted to commence operations in compliance

with all relevant regulations and pre-operational

requirements. Three types of visas; Investor

Visas, Employment Visas, and Residence Visas

were introduced by the Commission, while the

visa application and approval processes were

streamlined and automated in collaboration with

the Department of Immigration and Emigration

(DIE). Moreover, discussions were held in late 2022

to obtain investment support from a Saudi Arabia

based company for several projects, including

Colombo International Financial Centre Phase I,

Marina Waterfront Commercial, Marina Hotel, and

Super Luxury Villa.

Poverty Alleviation and Safety Nets

Sri Lankaâ€™s progress in eradicating

poverty stalled with heightened economic

vulnerabilities from multiple fronts during the

economic recession. Although commendable

progress has been made in poverty eradication

at the national level, a considerable portion

of the population still lives below the poverty

line, with significant income disparities across

different dimensions. By 2019, the percentage

of the population living below the poverty line

had declined to 14.3 per cent, compared to

46.8 per cent recorded in 2002, as per the updated

poverty line of the Department of Census and

Statistics (DCS). However, poverty level in the

estate sector remained high at 33.8 per cent,

compared to 15.0 per cent in the rural sector and

6.0 per cent in the urban sector in 2019, reflecting

significant disparities across the economic

sectors. The household Income and Expenditure

Survey (HIES) - 2019 highlighted that the poorest

20 per cent received only 4.6 per cent of the

countryâ€™s total household income, whereas the

richest 20 per cent of the population received

around 51.3 per cent of the total household income,

reaffirming the severity of the persistent issue of

income inequalities in the country. These poverty

statistics indicated that a significant portion of the

population of the country was vulnerable to poverty

even prior to the recent economic fallout. Against this

backdrop, poverty pockets of the population have

been largely exposed to economic shocks since

the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, while their

vulnerabilities have been amplified by worsened

macroeconomic conditions throughout 2022.

Continuous economic disruptions and the slowdown

in economic activity forced certain segments of the

population, who were faring well prior to the crisis,

towards the poverty line, with crisis associated

undesirable consequences on their income levels

and employment opportunities. Meanwhile, the

acceleration in consumer prices had a severe

impact on vulnerable households, exacerbating

pre-existing income inequalities. Reflecting the

current vulnerability of the population, the national

poverty line reached Rs. 13,777.00 by the end

of December 2022, registering a significant

year-on-year increase of approximately 74.1

per cent, along with the surge in inflation during

2022. In December 2022, the district poverty

lines of Colombo and Gampaha surpassed

Rs. 14,500.00, highlighting the disproportionate

impact of inflation on the cost of living in urban

areas, when compared to rural districts, such as

Kilinochchi and Monaragala, where district poverty

lines remained at Rs. 13,311.00 and Rs. 13,174.00,

respectively.

The prolonged crisis and related economic

disruptions have not only deprived the

financial capacity of households but also have

increased food insecurity and malnutrition

among marginalised groups of the population.

According to the special report of Crop and Food

Security Assessment Mission in September 2022,

jointly released by the World Food Programme

(WFP) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation

(FAO) of the United Nations, an estimated 6.3 million

people in Sri Lanka were facing moderate to severe

acute food insecurity. Without adequate life-saving

assistance and support for livelihoods, the situation

of these people could deteriorate further. Against

this backdrop, the Government opted for a reverse

graduation to obtain assistance from International

Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank,

thereby securing access to concessional financing

from IDA, while leveraging support from other

multilateral development assistances to stabilise

the economy and safeguard against hunger and

poverty.

In light of potential emergence of new

poverty pockets resulting from the economic

crisis, measures were taken to strengthen the

targeting of vulnerable groups in the population

for safety net programmes. Accordingly, the

Welfare Benefits Board initiated measures to

expedite the establishment of a social registry

under the 'Leave No One Behind' programme with

technical assistance from multilateral agencies

in 2022. Under this programme, it is planned

to establish the Welfare Benefits Information

System (WBIS) and develop an Integrated Welfare

Management System (IWMS) by end June 2023

with financial assistance from the Social Safety Nets

Project (SSNP) of the World Bank. The selection

process to determine eligibility for welfare benefit

payments under this programme was carried out

during 2022, while the verification of data through

household visits commenced in early 2023.

Further, the initial application process to gather

data for WBIS continued during the year, while

basic information of 3,726,596 applicants had been

registered by the end of 2022. This programme

aims to establish a continuous assessment of

social welfare beneficiariesâ€™ eligibility and to

eventually create a proper mechanism to exit from

welfare programmes by strengthening household

economic status. In early 2023, DCS, in

collaboration with the Ministry of Finance, Economic

Stabilisation and National Policies and several

other key government institutions, initiated steps to

conduct a household survey to assess the impact

of the economic crisis on living conditions. There

is an urgent need to expedite the development

of a social registry for identifying those in need

to ensure that timely assistance reaches the

intended beneficiaries. Creating such a database,

along with digitising welfare programmes, would

enable effective policy interventions for poverty

eradication, by improving the quality, adequacy,

and timeliness of data, while simultaneously

strengthening evidence based policy decisions in

the future.

The Government continued to carry out

existing safety net programmes during the

year to improve the socio-economic wellbeing

of low income households. The Department

of Samurdhi Development (DSD) distributed

around a total of Rs. 120 billion among 1.7

million beneficiary families and other categorical

beneficiaries under the cash transfer programme of

Samurdhi Subsidy programme, the Governmentâ€™s

flagship safety net programme. Considering the

disproportionate and immediate impact of the

pandemic on poor households, the Government

increased the monthly Samurdhi allowance for

beneficiary households by around 28 per cent

per family from February 2022, in line with the

Government Budget 2022. Accordingly, the

family unit allowances of Rs. 3,500, Rs. 2,500,

and Rs. 1,500 were increased to Rs. 4,500,

Rs. 3,200, and Rs. 1,900, per family, respectively.

With financial assistance from multilateral

agencies, DSD conducted an emergency cash

transfer programme from May to November 2022,

providing allowances ranging from Rs. 3,000

to Rs. 5,000 to existing Samurdhi beneficiary

families and waiting listed families under the

Samurdhi programme as well as individuals,

who were in waiting lists for subsidy schemes for

elderly, disabled, and kidney disease categories.

Under this programme, DSD disbursed around

Rs. 38.5 billion among 2.6 million beneficiary

families with financial assistance from the World

Bank, while the ADB provided financial assistance

for disbursing Rs. 45.5 billion among 3.0 million

beneficiary families. Moreover, another financial

assistance programme was implemented during

the year to ensure the nutritional well-being of

vulnerable families, including low income pregnant

and lactating mothers, women-headed families,

children under five years, and malnourished

individuals, with the facilitation from the WFP. This

project covered 41,710 selected families in the

districts of Ampara, Jaffna, Mannar, Monaragala,

Galle, Mullaitivu, and Nuwara Eliya, and the total

funds disbursed amounted to Rs. 625.7 million

by the end of 2022. Meanwhile, a direct cash

assistance of Rs. 10,000 per family was distributed

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

138

in the Kalutara District in August 2022, covering

families with children under five years of age. During

the year, DSD also remained involved in numerous

programmes aimed at enhancing livelihood,

social, and entrepreneurship development to

uplift the living standards of people. To improve

the efficiency of fund transfers, novel strategies

were adopted, such as developing software

for Customer Relationship Module (CRM), a

Mobile Application for Samurdhi Officers, and

more banking opportunities for beneficiaries.

The Government introduced several other social

welfare packages during the year, including

a kerosene subsidy for small boat owners in

the fishing industry and those in plantation

areas with no electricity, to provide a financial

cushion to families, who lost their livelihoods

due to the crisis. Additionally, a Multi-Sector

Combined Mechanism for Empowering Rural

Economic Revitalisation Centres was introduced

in September 2022, to achieve the dual objectives

of ensuring food security and preventing renewed

risks of malnutrition among children. Meanwhile,

the Ministry of Women, Child Affairs and Social

Empowerment continued to provide the nutrition

allowance of Rs. 2,000 for expecting mothers, who

registered with the clinics of the Medical Officer of

Health for the last 06 months of pregnancy and

the first 04 months of lactation. The Morning Meal

programme for pre-school children, for upgrading

the nutrition level of underweight children in

preschool age, was also carried out during the

year with the financial support from the World

Bank Project on Early Childhood Development.

Despite the numerous poverty eradication

programmes implemented by successive

governments over the past few decades, Sri

Lanka still experiences considerable income

disparities across multiple dimensions,

leaving its citizens more susceptible to abrupt

socio-economic setbacks. Therefore, revisiting

policy approaches to eradicating poverty remains

a major initiative in the countryâ€™s development

agenda towards achieving inclusive development.

The establishment of the national social registry

would support better resource utilisation by

channeling resources to the needy sector. The

framework should be allowed for greater flexibility

in updating the registry on a regular basis.

Additionally, while addressing the crisis driven

burden on vulnerable segments of the population

in the near term, the Government should focus

on uplifting the long term resilience of these

population groups by implementing well focused

rapid livelihood development programmes,

which would in turn reduce their dependency on

government subsidy programmes in the future.

Furthermore, poverty eradication policies should

take into account demographic changes in the

population, as well as the occurrence of natural

disasters, health emergencies, etc. Given the

larger share of the population employed in the

informal sector, implementing measures to

establish and promote superannuation funds

would help secure the future of these communities

during their retirement, without placing an

additional financial strain on the Government, in

the context of the ageing population, in particular.

Further, growing inequalities in education and

health should be addressed on a priority basis,

thereby breaking the vicious cycle of poverty faced

by marginalised populations of the economy. In

light of the economic crisis, a policy framework

that addresses worsening poverty levels both in

the short and long term should be formulated,

ensuring that the benefits of envisaged growth

recovery and progress are equitably distributed to

all citizens of the country. More importantly, the

political and other interference in the delivery of

welfare packages to the vulnerable needs to be

reduced to a minimum.

Environment

The National Environmental Policy (NEP)

was launched successfully in 2022, while

making a significant stride in developing a

consistent policy framework to protect the

present and future ecological sustainability

of the country. The Cabinet of Ministers granted

approval to the Ministry of Environment in June

2022 to spearhead the implementation of NEP,

which comprises policy interventions proposed

under seven thematic areas: land and water

resources, biodiversity and ecosystems, coastal

and marine resources, environmental pollution

prevention, control and waste management, climate

change and global environmental challenges,

built environment and green development, and

cross-cutting issues and challenges. NEP is

expected to ensure sustainable use, management,

and protection of environmental resources to create

enabling conditions for sustainable development in

Sri Lanka through a well defined policy framework.

Further, with the intention of effectively implementing

NEP, the national environmental action plan for

2022-2030 was finalised during the year, identifying

strategies that convert policy statements of NEP

into implementable actions.

Several other initiatives rolled out with the

significant commitment of the Government

and Ministry of Environment to strengthen the

focus on the sustainable and efficient use of

natural resources in the economic recovery

process. In the pursuit of achieving the status

of Net Zero Carbon level by 2050, the Sri Lanka

Climate Prosperity Plan (CPP) was presented to

the UN Climate Change Conference (COP27)

in 2022. CPP is expected to act as the national

investment strategy to attract climate related

foreign investment to Sri Lanka, while accelerating

climate adaptation and reducing greenhouse gas

emissions. Further, in 2022, the draft of the National

Cooling Policy was completed, intending to reduce

greenhouse gas emissions through cooling sector

(air conditioning and refrigeration) improvements

including energy efficiency, use of renewable

energy, and sustainable cooling solutions. This

policy facilitates the countryâ€™s plan for phasedown

hydrofluorocarbon as agreed under the Kigali

Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. With another

significant step forward in the country's efforts

to protect its unique and diverse environment, in

2022, the Cabinet of Ministers granted approval

for 'The National Policy in Environmental Sensitive

Areas in Sri Lanka', which is expected to strengthen

the conservation and protection of environmentally

sensitive areas, including areas of high biodiversity,

wetlands, and coastal zones.

The Central Environment Authority (CEA)

implemented several measures to safeguard

the environment during the year. To prevent

and minimise the release of discharges and

emissions into the environment from specific

industrial operations in compliance with national

discharge and emission requirements, CEA

implemented the Environment Protection License

(EPL) procedure. In 2022, the prescribed activity

list and the EPL regulations were amended by

the gazette notifications No. 2264/18 and No.

2264/17, respectively, to reinforce the existing

EPL procedure. As of end 2022, a total of 19,160

industries had obtained EPL licenses, while 786

BOI industries were also under the EPL procedure.

Furthermore, to carry out its mandate to assess the

possible environmental impact of projects through

environmental impact assessments (EIA) and initial

environmental examinations (IEE), CEA approved

seven EIAs and 237 IEEs in 2022.

Environmental management authorities

carried out several activities to improve the

nation's readiness for disasters. In collaboration

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

140

with the National Building Research Organisation

(NBRO) and DMT, CEA continued to carry out

Air Quality Monitoring Programme, which was

initiated in 2019. During the year, under this

programme, sensor based air quality monitoring

equipment units were installed in the cities of

Kurunegala, Anuradhapura, and Jaffna with the

assistance of WHO, reinforcing the ongoing Air

Quality Monitoring Programme. Meanwhile, in

December 2022, a deterioration in the quality of

the atmosphere was discovered in many parts

of the country to the transboundary air pollution

effects, and the public was informed to remain

vigilant. Recognising Sri Lankaâ€™s high exposure

to such challenges and lack of established

framework for guidelines to follow in such

circumstances, Ministry of Environment initiated

the development of a Contingency Response

Action Plan in collaboration with CEA and several

other stakeholders. This plan identifies local

emission sources that can be limited during such

critical time periods. Further, authorities continued

to engage in disaster mitigating programmes

during the year to minimise the socio-economic

impact of natural disasters. The Department of

Meteorology issued 568 weather warnings and

advisories to the general public, related disaster

management authorities, and the Department of

Fisheries to carry out early preparations during

2022. Meanwhile, NBRO was able to structurally

mitigate two landslide sites in Nuwara Eliya and

another in Colombo in 2022 as a part of its landslide

risk mitigation measures, and continued its project

on mapping areas with landslide hazard, covering

480 km2 in the Kandy and Kegalle districts during

the year.

The world is fast moving towards the

circular economy and beyond. The climate

change impacts are well articulated and already

experienced by many countries, including Sri

Lanka. The Paris Agreement (2015), COP26

(2021) and COP27 (2022) are ready to fund

countries that are potentially subject severe

disasters of climate change. It is necessary for Sri

Lanka also to focus on these aspects and prepare

a comprehensive framework in readiness and

be compliant with governance principles agreed

at the above mentioned summits. Economic

infrastructure is one area Sri Lanka has to comply

with widely agreed principles and compliant

countries would be able to receive funding for

earmarked infrastructure projects, primarily

renewable energy projects. As it is a long drawn

process, Sri Lanka needs to pay attention to global

agreements.
