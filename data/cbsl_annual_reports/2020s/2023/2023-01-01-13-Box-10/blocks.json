GFC showed that a crisis can emerge even in a stable economic environment and merely microprudential policies would not be adequate to prevent such a crisis as regulatory policies were focused on individual institutions with no policies available to deal with systemic risks. Systemic risk is defined as the risk of disruptions to the provision of financial services that is caused by an impairment of all or parts of the financial system and can cause serious negative consequences for the real economy (International Monetary Fund, Financial Stability Board, and Bank for International Settlements, 2009). Hence, GFC raised the need for a strong macroprudential policy framework to constrain the buildup of risks in the financial system. Central Banks in the post GFC era recognised the significance of linkages between the macroeconomy and the financial system vis-a-vis macrofinancial linkages. Thus, it became apparent that it is vital to identify macrofinancial linkages and interdependence of institutions while systemic risks need to be contained by dedicated financial sector policies.",

Hence, the real time uncertainty and evolving nature of systemic risk over the cycle requires constant assessment of developments and evaluation of the adequacy of macroprudential policy responses. In this sense, macroprudential policy represents a proactive approach to prudential regulation through a set of instruments and measures that respond flexibly when warranted in a time varying fashion over the financial cycle. The macroprudential stance that aggregates the overall macroprudential policy mix tends to tighten in the expansionary phase of the financial cycle1 as cyclical risks tend to accumulate and loosen in the recessionary phase of the cycle (see Figure B 10.1).",

    "text": "The tendency to mobilise all available policy tools (including prudential policies) to stabilise the real economy in response to large shocks has been observed since GFC in 2009. Moreover, this was more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic where prudential policies played an important macro-stabilisation role along with more traditional fiscal and monetary policy measures and a vital role in Central Banks\u2019 policy mix (Warjiyo and Juhro, 2022). While macroprudential policy may have to be implemented with other policies, there is a high level of interaction with monetary policy and microprudential policy. Accordingly, monetary and financial system stability objectives and tools can conflict with or complement each other. For instance, monetary policy may under certain circumstances contribute to the buildup of imbalances and influence risk taking behaviour of agents. For example, prolonged accommodative monetary policy periods may lead to asset price bubbles and excessive credit growth episodes. Hence, there might be a need for countercyclical macroprudential policy tools to combat financial stability risks. On the other hand, a stable financial system enables smooth transmission of monetary policy and better allocation of resources in the economy. This close relationship predetermines the need to monitor, analyse, and assess the impact of monetary and macroprudential policies and measures on the attainment of such policy objectives and, if necessary, to coordinate between the said policies. Moreover, the activities of macroprudential policy and microprudential oversight also complement each other as they use the same information base, and a substantial amount of the information obtained during microprudential supervision is considered in macroprudential policymaking. Such complementarities and conflicts must be carefully considered, and synergistic effects must be used when applicable (Warjiyo and Juhro, 2022). Further, the need for close coordination is necessary as these objectives are hard to be separated and strict separation would be counterproductive.",

Dynamic bank solvency stress testing, liquidity stress testing, interconnectedness analysis frameworks, and strengthened data collection frameworks related to such risk analyses have been already established and several fruitful rounds have been completed. The Central Bank is currently developing a series of macroprudential tools targeted at financial sector participants regulated and supervised by the Central Bank or their exposures. In executing the powers vested on the implementation of macroprudential policies and in line with international best practices, the Central Bank will develop and propose prudential standards to be applied by financial sector authorities in respect of financial sector participants regulated by such authorities.

In this regard, the Central Bank will strengthen the involvement of the Financial System Oversight Committee (FSOC) in financial stability matters, which will coordinate with the relevant financial sector authorities representing the financial system in implementing proposals/ recommendations made by the Central Bank. The Financial System Stability Review currently being published by the Central Bank will be enriched and will cater to the statutory requirement of publishing a review report on the stability of the financial system on an annual basis. This report will include the Central Bank\u2019s assessment of financial system stability, risks and vulnerabilities identified thereof, an overview of the measures taken by the Central Bank, and other financial sector authorities in the given period to address the risks identified and an overview of the recommendations made by FSOC with the current level of progress in implementation.",
