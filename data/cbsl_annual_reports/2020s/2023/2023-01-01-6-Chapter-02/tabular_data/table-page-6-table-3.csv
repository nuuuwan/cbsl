Following the increase in the GDP estimates at current 
prices, macroeconomic indicators which are expressed 
as  a  percentage  of  GDP  such  as  Budget  Deficit  and 
Debt to GDP were also revised. Generally, a rebasing 
process  provides  policymakers  and  other  stakeholders 
with  a  more  representative  set  of  economic  statistics 
of  the  existing  economic  structure  for  better  evidence 
based decision making. However, when referring to the 
rebased  GDP  estimates,  it  is  imperative  to  understand 
the impact of one-off events separately from the impact 
of long lasting events and evaluate them appropriately.
