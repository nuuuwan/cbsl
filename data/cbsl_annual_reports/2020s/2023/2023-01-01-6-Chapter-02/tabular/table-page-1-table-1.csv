"2.1 Overview"
"crisis. The economic crisis initially caused supply disruptions in the forms of severe shortages of consumer 
The  Sri  Lankan  economy  contracted  by  7.8  per  cent  in  2022  on  a  year-on-year  basis,  recording"
"goods, energy sources including fuel and electricity, and inputs for various industries, mainly on account of"
"the sharp depletion of foreign exchange liquidity in the market leading to a significant increase in prices. This"
"situation compelled both the Central Bank and Government to introduce painful but essential policy measures,"
"such as unprecedented adjustments to policy interest rates to curtail inflationary pressures and prioritisation"
"of essential imports to minimise foreign exchange outflows, to prevent further worsening of the crisis. These"
"measures contributed to contain demand pressures, minimise supply side disruptions, and improve availability"
"of  essential  imports  including  fuel  and  material  for  industries,  thereby  gradually  stabilising  the  economy."
"Reflecting the impact of economic stresses, all three major economic activities, namely, Industry, Services"
"and  Agriculture,  contracted  during  the  year  2022.  The  setback  in  manufacturing,  construction,  and  mining"
"and  quarrying  activities  led  the  contraction  in  Industry  activities,  while  contractions  observed  particularly"
"in  real  estate  activities 
including  ownership  of  dwellings, 
insurance,  and 
financial  services,  negatively"
"affected Services activities, outpacing the positive spillovers of the recovery in tourist arrivals recorded on a"
"year-on-year basis. Subdued performance in fishing activities caused by fuel shortages, in animal production"
"owing  to  shortages  of  animal  feed,  and  in  growing  of  rice  and  vegetables  driven  by  the  lack  of  fertiliser,"
"dampened  the  overall  growth  in  Agriculture  activities.  This  situation  in  turn  resulted  in  a  decline  in  labour"
"productivity despite the favourable developments in key labour market indicators. On the expenditure front,"
"both consumption and investment grew significantly at current prices induced by elevated price levels in 2022."
"However,  at  constant  prices,  both  investment  and  consumption  contracted,  driven  by  the  deterioration  of"
"purchasing power and holding up of investments under soaring inflation and high borrowing cost. On the other"
"hand, net external demand at current prices improved due to substantial growth in the export of goods and"
"services benefitting from the sharp depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee, which surpassed the growth in the"
"import of goods and services. The relatively slower growth in imports was largely a result of dried-up forex"
"liquidity in the banking sector, restrictions on non-essential imports, sharp depreciation of the rupee, and the"
"significant tightening of monetary policy."
