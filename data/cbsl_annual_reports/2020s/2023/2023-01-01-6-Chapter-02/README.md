2.1 OverviewT

he Sri Lankan economy contracted by 7.8 per cent in 2022 on a year-on-year basis, recording its highest contraction in the backdrop of the worst ever economic crisis experienced by the post-independence economy, while prudent policy intervention averted possible deepening of the

crisis. The economic crisis initially caused supply disruptions in the forms of severe shortages of consumer

goods, energy sources including fuel and electricity, and inputs for various industries, mainly on account of

the sharp depletion of foreign exchange liquidity in the market leading to a significant increase in prices. This

situation compelled both the Central Bank and Government to introduce painful but essential policy measures,

such as unprecedented adjustments to policy interest rates to curtail inflationary pressures and prioritisation

of essential imports to minimise foreign exchange outflows, to prevent further worsening of the crisis. These

measures contributed to contain demand pressures, minimise supply side disruptions, and improve availability

of essential imports including fuel and material for industries, thereby gradually stabilising the economy.

Reflecting the impact of economic stresses, all three major economic activities, namely, Industry, Services

and Agriculture, contracted during the year 2022. The setback in manufacturing, construction, and mining

and quarrying activities led the contraction in Industry activities, while contractions observed particularly

in real estate activities including ownership of dwellings, insurance, and financial services, negatively

affected Services activities, outpacing the positive spillovers of the recovery in tourist arrivals recorded on a

year-on-year basis. Subdued performance in fishing activities caused by fuel shortages, in animal production

owing to shortages of animal feed, and in growing of rice and vegetables driven by the lack of fertiliser,

dampened the overall growth in Agriculture activities. This situation in turn resulted in a decline in labour

productivity despite the favourable developments in key labour market indicators. On the expenditure front,

both consumption and investment grew significantly at current prices induced by elevated price levels in 2022.

However, at constant prices, both investment and consumption contracted, driven by the deterioration of

purchasing power and holding up of investments under soaring inflation and high borrowing cost. On the other

hand, net external demand at current prices improved due to substantial growth in the export of goods and

services benefitting from the sharp depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee, which surpassed the growth in the

import of goods and services. The relatively slower growth in imports was largely a result of dried-up forex

liquidity in the banking sector, restrictions on non-essential imports, sharp depreciation of the rupee, and the

significant tightening of monetary policy.

mainly reflects the impact of increased price levels

during the year as indicated by the surge in GDP

implicit deflator to 48.8 per cent in 2022, from 8.5

per cent recorded in 2021.

The Gross National Income (GNI), estimated

by adjusting GDP for the net primary income

from the rest of the world, also grew by 36.7 per

cent at current prices in 2022, compared to the

growth of 12.8 per cent recorded in 2021. This

growth in GNI during the year merely reflects the

increase in GDP at current prices, as net primary

income from the rest of the world deteriorated.

GDP per capita increased to Rs. 1,088,667

(US dollars 3,474) in 2022, compared to

Rs. 794,376 (US dollars 3,997) in 2021. The

increase in GDP per capita in rupee terms was

driven by the significant increase in GDP at current

prices, while GDP per capita in US dollar terms

declined due to the substantial depreciation of the

Sri Lanka rupee against the US dollar during the

year. Meanwhile, GNI per capita was estimated at

Rs. 1,060,654 (US dollars 3,388) in 2022, compared

to Rs. 776,523 (US dollars 3,907) in 2021.

2.3 Contribution from

Institutional Sectors

The Non-Financial Corporations (NFC)

sector, representing 43.6 per cent share, was

the largest contributor to the Gross Value

Added (GVA) estimated at current market

prices in 2022. Accordingly, the NFC sector grew

by 38.7 per cent in 2022, compared to the growth

of 14.5 per cent in the previous year. Further, the

NFC sector remained the largest contributor to

Industry activities, while Agriculture and Services

activities were mainly contributed by the Household

and Non-Profit Institutions Serving Households

(HH and NPISH) sector. Meanwhile, the HH and

NPISH, General Government (GG) and Financial

Corporations (FC) sectors grew by 42.5 per cent,

7.1 per cent and 52.1 per cent, respectively, in 2022.

2.4 Output, Policies, Institutional Support and Issues

Agriculture

The supply side headwinds including

severe shortages of agricultural inputs,

particularly those of fertilisers and other

agrochemicals, substantial increase in

production cost, and disruptions in fuel

supply hampered the overall performance of

Agriculture activities during 2022. Accordingly,

Agriculture activities contracted by 4.6 per cent

in 2022 in value-added terms, compared to the

growth of 0.9 per cent recorded in 2021, mainly

with significant contractions in total fishing,

growing of rice and animal production. In addition,

Introduction

National Accounts estimates are among the critical inputs in economic analyses as well as in policymaking as they reflect the real sector developments of an economy. Therefore, it is essential to accommodate the changes in the economic and price structures of an economy over time to the National Accounts estimates through regular rebasing exercises. Fulfilling this requirement, the base year of Sri Lankan National Accounts estimates has been revised from time to time, to 1958, 1963, 1975, 1990, 2002, 2010 in history, and the latest to 2015. The Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), as the official compiler, updated the base year of National Accounts estimates to 2015, replacing the previous base year of 2010. Alongside the latest rebasing exercise, DCS expanded the production boundary and broadened the coverage of economic activities while some improvements were made to the compilation methodologies.

Expanding the Production Boundary and Coverage of Economic Activities

The coverage of many economic activities was broadened during the latest rebasing exercise. One of the major coverage expansions is the inclusion of reclamation work relating to the Colombo International Financial City (CIFC) project into the Industry activities, which were carried out during the period from 2014 to 2018, taking into account the percentage of work done in each year. This led to considerable fluctuations in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) estimates and the corresponding GDP growth rates during the period 2014-2019. The coverage of several Agriculture and Services activities was also broadened during this rebasing exercise. Along with these coverage improvements, the rebased GDP estimates related to the Production Approach were disseminated under 49 economic activities, instead of 48 economic activities under the 2010 series. This is attributable to the estimation of plant propagation and agricultural supporting activities separately under the new base year. In terms of Agriculture activities, coverage improvements were introduced to the growing

BOX 4Rebasing of National Accounts Estimates to Base Year 20151

of fruits, oil palm, flower plant propagation, household log production, and agricultural supporting activities. In terms of Services activities, the coverage in the areas of information technology, warehousing activities, broadcasting activities, courier services and financial services were broadened during this rebasing exercise.

Methodological Improvements and Use of New Data Sources

During the rebasing exercise, several methodological improvements were adopted in estimating many economic activities, such as agricultural supporting activities, forestry and logging, plant propagation of flower plants, manufacturing, construction, electricity generation, IT programming consultancy, accommodation services, food and beverage service activities, and wholesale and retail trade activities. Further, new data sources including Economic Census 2013/14, Information Technology and Information Technology Enabled Services Survey and revenue information related to the registered companies of Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) were incorporated in compiling the rebased estimates under the 2015 base year. Moreover, DCS adopted the “Double Deflation method” in place of the “Single Deflation method” in compiling the estimates for many economic activities at constant prices under the new base year2.

Key Outcomes of Rebasing National Accounts Estimates to Base Year 2015

The base year revision affected many economic indicators, such as the size of the economy (value of GDP), GDP growth rate, and share of major economic activities to the GDP. Compared to the previous base year of 2010, the rebased GDP estimates at constant prices indicated a level shift attributable to the

2. Under the “Single Deflation method” both Output and Intermediate Consumption (IC) are deflated using the same price index, whereas in the “Double Deflation method”, Output and IC are deflated using two different price indices to compile constant price estimates accurately.

replacement of 2010 base year prices with 2015 prices to capture the evolution in prices, as well as the coverage and methodological improvements. Consequently, the corresponding GDP growth rates were affected by the base year revision. Particularly, the addition of reclamation work related to the CIFC project led to a considerable shift in GDP level, as well as growth rates during the 2014-2019 period which is reflected in the data presented in Table B 4.1 and Figure B 4.1.

Further, along with the base year revision, the

contribution to GDP from its major components namely,

Agriculture, Industry, Services, and Taxes less Subsidies

on Products were changed, especially with an increase

in the share of Industry activities and a decline in the

share of Services activities and Taxes less Subsidies on

Products as shown in Figure B 4.2.

Following the increase in the GDP estimates at current prices, macroeconomic indicators which are expressed as a percentage of GDP such as Budget Deficit and Debt to GDP were also revised. Generally, a rebasing process provides policymakers and other stakeholders with a more representative set of economic statistics of the existing economic structure for better evidence based decision making. However, when referring to the rebased GDP estimates, it is imperative to understand the impact of one-off events separately from the impact of long lasting events and evaluate them appropriately.

the Business Outlook Survey2 (BOS) conducted

Index of Agricultural Production

The Volume Index of Agricultural Production

(VIAP),3 which measures the output of the

agriculture sector, recorded a significant

contraction in 2022. The overall VIAP contracted

by 19.4 per cent, year-on-year, during 2022,

compared to a year-on-year growth of 2.1 per cent

in 2021. Most of the sub-indices, including paddy,

tea, rubber, and livestock and livestock products,

contributed to the overall decline, whereas the fruits

sub-index recorded a significant improvement,

along with the coconut sub-index, compared to the

previous year.

Paddy

Total paddy production of the country

declined significantly in 2022, recording its

lowest annual production since 2017, amidst

severe supply side disruptions, including the

shortage of fertilisers. Despite the lifting of the ban

on the importation of inorganic fertilisers and other

agrochemicals in the latter part of 2021, the sequels

of the ban, compounded with the lack of foreign

exchange to import required fertilisers, resulted in acute

fertiliser shortages in the country, having a significant

bearing on the paddy sector, among others. Following

the bumper harvest in 2021, annual paddy production

recorded a decline of 34.1 per cent, year-on-year, to

3.4 million metric tons in 2022. This was a combined

outcome of a 36.9 per cent decline in the 2021/2022

Maha season which accounted for 57.0 per cent of

total production, and a 30.0 per cent drop in the paddy

harvest in the 2022 Yala season. The net land extent

harvested during the year marginally declined by

1.1 per cent to 1,114,246 hectares, while the average

yield of paddy declined to 3,045 kilogrammes per

hectare in 2022, compared to 4,571 kilogrammes

per hectare, recorded in 2021, reflecting the impact

of input shortages and productivity slowdown during

these seasons. The total paddy production in 2022

was equivalent to 2.1 million metric tons of rice, and

approximately 11 months of sufficiency of household

rice demand.4 In order to arrest the price pressures

stemming from rice shortages in the domestic market

and meet the overall rice requirement of the country

while ensuring food security, the Government initiated

measures to import rice during the year. Accordingly,

around 783,420 metric tons of rice were imported

in 2022, compared to 147,091 metric tons of rice

imported during the previous year. Nevertheless, as

domestically available rice stocks gradually increased,

along with imported stocks and the harvest from the

Yala season, a ban was imposed on the importation

of rice, except for a few varieties, with effect from

09 December 2022.

Elevated input costs, combined with the

drop in production, resulted in higher paddy

and rice prices during 2022. Continuing the trend

4 The level of sufficiency is based on the average household rice consumption estimate in the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) – 2019. However, the actual rice demand of the country may be significantly higher than the HIES average household rice consumption estimate, as it excludes the rice demand for other sources, such as restaurants and hotels, rice-based food industries, etc.

observed since late 2021, paddy prices recorded a

further increase during early 2022, largely driven

by supply shortages stemming from the lower

production in the 2021/2022 Maha season

and increased demand resulting from market

speculations about supply shortages in the market.

The Government intermittently intervened in the

paddy and rice markets to reduce price volatility

and maintain a steady supply. Accordingly, the

guaranteed purchasing prices for a kilogramme

of Samba, Nadu, and Keeri Samba paddy were

increased to Rs. 92.00, Rs. 90.00, and Rs. 95.00,

respectively, during the 2021/2022 Maha season,

pursuant to the paddy purchasing programme of the

Paddy Marketing Board (PMB). PMB was able to

purchase around 71,280 metric tons of paddy from

the 2021/2022 Maha season. Further, considering

the escalation of cost of production in the paddy

sector, PMB increased the guaranteed purchase

prices of a kilogramme of Samba, Nadu, and Keeri

Samba paddy to Rs. 125.00, Rs. 120.00, and

Rs. 130.00, respectively, in the 2022 Yala season.

However, PMB was able to purchase only around

7,076 metric tons of paddy under the new

guaranteed prices due to lack of funding available

for PMB to purchase paddy, thereby compelling

farmers to sell their paddy stocks at a low price to

private millers, causing a moderation of paddy

prices towards late 2022. However, the average

prices of all varieties of paddy remained above the

price levels observed in 2021. The average price

of Samba paddy recorded a notable increase of

66.4 per cent, year-on-year, to Rs. 108.69 per

kilogramme, from Rs. 65.32 per kilogramme

recorded in 2021, while the average price of

Nadu paddy also increased substantially to

Rs. 103.87 per kilogramme in 2022, from Rs. 57.61

per kilogramme recorded in 2021, registering a

year-on-year increase of 80.3 per cent over the

previous year. Following similar trends in paddy

prices, the prices of rice varieties also showed

an upward trend throughout 2022, despite some

moderation in late 2022. Accordingly, the average

retail prices of Samba and Nadu were at Rs. 209.19

per kilogramme and Rs. 213.36 per kilogramme,

respectively, in 2022, compared to Rs. 136.52

per kilogramme and Rs. 116.56 per kilogramme,

respectively, in 2021. Meanwhile, several measures

were undertaken by the Government to stabilise

retail rice prices in the market, including the

imposition of a maximum retail price (MRP) for

rice varieties and boosting supply through rice

imports to address the excessive volatility in retail

rice prices amidst shortfalls in the rice supply in the

local market. Accordingly, MRPs for Nadu, Samba,

and Keeri Samba were imposed at Rs. 220.00

per kilogramme, Rs. 230.00 per kilogramme, and

Rs. 260.00 per kilogramme, respectively, effective

from 02 May 2022. To alleviate the impact of

persistently high prices, the Government launched

a programme to purchase Nadu paddy from farmers

at Rs.100.00 per kilogramme during the 2022/2023

Maha season, with the intention of distributing 10

kilogrammes of rice per month to low income families

in March and April 2023.

Several measures were undertaken by the

Government in 2022 to address contemporary

issues in the agriculture sector, while striving to

improve the long term productivity of the sector.

With due consideration to the adverse effects of

inadequate fertiliser availability emanating from

the banning of importation of chemical fertilisers

and agrochemicals as well as the limited liquidity in

the domestic foreign exchange market to facilitate

fertiliser imports, the Government expedited

measures to provide chemical fertilisers since the

third quarter of 2022. Accordingly, the Government

procured 65,000 metric tons of urea under the

Indian line of credit for the 2022 Yala cultivation,

while the distribution of urea to paddy farmers was

made at a subsidised price of Rs. 10,000.00 per a

50 kilogramme sack of urea during the 2022 Yala

season. In addition, several arrangements were

made with international organisations, including the

World Bank (WB), the Asian Development Bank

(ADB), and the Food and Agriculture Organisation

(FAO), through various assistance programmes

and grants to ensure the timely supply of required

urea, Triple Super Phosphate (TSP), and Muriate

of Potash (MOP) fertilisers for the 2022/2023 Maha

season and for upcoming seasons. Accordingly, the

Government was able to disburse around 100,000

metric tons of urea for paddy cultivation in 2022/2023

Maha season, significantly contributing to the

recovery of the paddy sector. Further, considering

the need for allowing domestic use of glyphosate

as a weedicide, the Cabinet of Ministers granted

approval in September 2022 to import required

quantities of glyphosate for agricultural purposes

in the 2022/2023 Maha Season for a period of six

months. In addition, urgent measures were taken

to address the nutrient deficiencies which led to the

yellowing of paddy plants in certain districts during

the 2022/2023 Maha season, via provisioning of

fertilisers and other organic supplements, while

expediting extension services for pest and disease

management. In addition, rice variety screening

programmes to identify the best performing varieties

continued throughout 2022, and four new varieties

with special characteristics of short duration, high

yield, and drought resistance were released in 2022.

Of these four new varieties, one was released for

industrial purposes, such as biscuit production. In

an effort to improve precision agriculture through

site-specific weed management, experiments were

carried out in trial paddy fields to identify major weed

types and the impact of those weed types on paddy

fields using multispectral drone image technologies.

Tea

The production of tea registered a notable

decline of 16.0 per cent, year-on-year, in

2022, largely due to the lagged effect of acute

shortages of fertilisers and agrochemicals

domestically. The preliminary diagnosis carried

out by the Tea Research Institute (TRI) on the

large decline of crop yields in several regions of

the country pointed out that inaccessibility to

chemical fertilisers and agrochemicals, particularly

urea based fertilisers and weedicides, significantly

impacting the reported yield losses during the year.

Accordingly, production of high, medium, and low

grown tea, which contributed to around 22 per cent,

16 per cent, and 62 per cent of the total production,

respectively, declined by 13.8 per cent, 21.2 per

cent, and 15.4 per cent, respectively, in 2022.

Meanwhile, the average yield in the smallholder

sector decreased to 1,193 kilogrammes per

hectare, compared to 1,414 kilogrammes per

hectare reported in 2021, registering a year-on-year

decline of 15.6 per cent in average yield. The

tea sector experienced a rise in production costs

in 2022 due to the elevated prices of chemical

fertilisers and other agricultural inputs coupled

with domestic shortages of those inputs, as well as

the upward adjustments in utility prices, including

fuel, electricity, and water, thereby hampering the

country’s competitiveness in global tea markets.

Consequently, the estimated cost of production

of tea increased by Rs. 20.00 to Rs. 639.00 per

kilogramme in 2022, compared to 2021.

Tea prices at the Colombo Tea Auction (CTA)

reached the historically highest level in 2022

and remained elevated throughout the year. The

average price of tea increased notably by 105.2

per cent to Rs. 1,270.50 per kilogramme during the

year, from Rs. 619.15 per kilogramme recorded in

2021. Accordingly, the average tea prices for high,

medium, and low grown tea reported year-on-year

increase of 94.6 per cent, 93.5 per cent, and 110.8

per cent, respectively, in 2022. Further, the average

price received by smallholders for green leaves also

increased significantly to Rs. 182.07 per kilogramme

in 2022, compared to Rs. 93.67 per kilogramme

in 2021. The average export price (FOB) of tea

increased by 8.7 per cent to US dollars 5.03 per

kilogramme during 2022, compared to US dollars

4.63 per kilogramme recorded in the preceding year.

The increase in average tea prices during the year

was partly attributed to the decline in the quantity

supplied to the CTA amidst the decline in local

production, while the depreciation of the Sri Lanka

rupee also contributed to the price hike in rupee terms.

In 2022, several measures were undertaken

by the Government aimed at enhancing the

productivity, value addition, and competitiveness

of the Sri Lanka’s tea Industry. The Sri Lanka

Tea Board (SLTB) initiated a concessionary loan

scheme at an interest rate of 8.0 per cent enabling

tea factories to purchase fertiliser for their green tea

leaves suppliers. During the year, SLTB disbursed

Rs.16.9 million among 38 tea factories under the

Factory Modernisation Subsidy Scheme, supporting

modernisation activities of these factories aimed

at improving the quality of the production process.

In addition, SLTB granted Rs. 56.4 million through

the Replantation Subsidy Programme to enhance

the productivity of tea lands, while a subsidy of Rs.

24.5 million was provided for the installation of

irrigation sprinkler systems in 204 acres of medium-

scale tea lands. Several measures were undertaken

by the Tea Small Holdings Development Authority

(TSHDA) in relation to tea replanting and new

planting programmes and crop rehabilitation subsidy

programmes. During the year, 912 hectares of tea

lands were replanted and 408 hectares of new lands

were converted into tea lands, while the process of

infilling in tea lands was continued. Throughout the

year, efforts towards enhancing awareness among

tea smallholders were carried out through advisory

services. TRI continued its efforts in relation to

research and development activities and service

projects pursuant to its strategic plan. Accordingly,

special projects, such as the development and

introduction of a motorised selective tea harvester

suitable for tea lands in the country, establishment of

seed gardens to increase the production of improved

seeds as a source of planting materials in drought

prone areas, promotion of commercialisation of

microbial bio pesticides in tea cultivation, and

expansion of mother bush areas of new tea

cultivars were underway during the year.

Rubber

Rubber production continued to decline in

2022 for the second consecutive year, largely

driven by the combined effect of adverse

weather conditions that prevailed in rubber

growing areas, fertiliser shortages, and the

spread of the Pestalotiopsis disease. The

impact of fertiliser shortages on immature rubber

plantations during 2022 was significant, causing

stunted tree growth that causes delays in the

tapping stage of plantations and reduces land

productivity in the period ahead. Furthermore,

the scarcity of agrochemicals resulted in severe

propagation of the Pestalotiopsis disease in rubber

plantations during the year, affecting around

40,000 hectares of rubber plantations, resulting

in a decline in yield ranging from 0-10 per cent

in affected rubber plantations. Accordingly, total

rubber production decreased by 7.8 per cent

to 70.9 million kilogrammes, year-on-year,

in 2022. Among major categories of rubber

production, sheet rubber production accounted for

49.0 per cent of the total rubber production with a

contraction of 9.6 per cent, while production of other

categories of rubber recorded a decline of 11.7 per

cent during the year, compared to 2021. However,

crepe rubber production recorded a growth of 3.9

per cent during 2022. Despite the notable increase

in local rubber prices in 2022, productivity and

tapping limitations in the rubber sector prevented

plausible improvements in production. Meanwhile,

the average yield of rubber reduced by 2.1 per cent,

year-on-year, to 665 kilogrammes per hectare in

2022 due to the reduction in tapping days. The cost

of production of rubber was on the rise and recorded

at Rs. 288.00 per kilogramme by end of 2022,

registering an increase of 30.3 per cent from the

previous year. In 2022, the domestic consumption

of raw rubber by the industrial sector contracted by

12.4 per cent to 117.3 million kilogrammes, which

was partially attributed to the decline in demand

for medical gloves in both domestic and global

markets as the COVID-19 pandemic faded away.

The prices of most varieties of rubber at the

Colombo Rubber Auction reached historically

high levels, driven by the favourable demand in

the global market during the first half of 2022. At

the Colombo Rubber Auction, the annual average

price of Ribbed Smoked Sheet No.1 (RSS1)

increased to Rs. 595.00 per kilogramme in 2022

from Rs. 460.78 per kilogramme in 2021, registering

a year-on-year increase of 29.1 per cent, while the

average price of latex crepe also increased notably

by 44.2 per cent, year-on-year, to Rs. 903.27 per

kilogramme from Rs. 626.32 per kilogramme in

2021. Nevertheless, towards the latter part of the

year, rubber prices were on a decelerating trend,

mainly due to weaker demand for rubber based

products in both domestic and global markets.

Accordingly, at end 2022, the average auction

prices of RSS1 and latex crepe rubber stood at

Rs. 517.67 per kilogramme and Rs. 628.33 per

kilogramme, respectively. The average FOB price

of rubber also marginally increased to US dollars

2.73 per kilogramme in 2022 from US dollars 2.72

per kilogramme recorded in the previous year.

Strategies for improving the productivity

and value additions in the rubber sector

continued in 2022. The Rubber Research Institute

(RRI) conducted multiple research studies during

the year in its effort to increase the productivity

of the rubber sector. During the year, research

on the adaptation of low-intensity harvesting

systems was carried out with the aim of reducing

production costs and handling labour shortages,

particularly in non-traditional areas. As a result,

approximately 1,600 hectares of rubber lands

owned by smallholders and plantation companies

were converted to 'once in four days tapping

system'. Screening of clones to identify resistant

clones against leaf diseases was completed in

2022 in an effort to prevent significant yield losses

caused by such diseases, while measures were

also underway to identify climate resilient clones

for sustainable rubber cultivation. During the

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

year, programmes aimed at raising awareness

among rubber farmers on improved techniques

for applying slow-release fertiliser and enhancing

the nutritional intake of plants were carried out

in several rubber growing regions, covering

Monaragala, Middeniya, Matugama, Horana,

Bulathsinhala, Kalutara, Kegalle, and Ratnapura.

Further, the Rubber Development Department

(RDD) continued to engage in expanding the

rubber cultivation extent through new planting

and replanting activities during the year. Under

the new planting programmes, latex harvesting

was commenced in 2022 at the first established

rubber field in Mullaitivu in the Northern Province.

Measures were also taken to popularise different

types of rubber-based intercropping systems and

crop diversification in unutilised lands through field

demonstrations in different trial fields. Meanwhile,

in the light of the rising cost of cultivation, revisions

were made to the subsidy schemes for replanting

and new planting with effect from 01 January 2022,

in order to reduce the number of installments for

the provision of subsidy funds from eight to five

without altering the amount of the subsidy. A

series of awareness programmes on sustainable

harvesting through proper management of

rubber bark was conducted with the financial

support of the National Science Foundation of

Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, training programmes on

rubber product manufacturing targeting small and

medium-sized entrepreneurs as well as rubber

smallholders were conducted during the year,

aimed at promoting value addition in the rubber

sector, thereby strengthening the integration of

local rubber products in the global value chain.

Coconut

The coconut sector registered its highest

ever annual production in 2022, due to the

favourable weather conditions that prevailed

during 2021 and 2022. Accordingly, total nut

production increased to 3,391 million nuts in 2022,

recording a year-on-year increase of 8.7 per cent,

over the notable increase of 11.7 per cent recorded

in 2021. The increase in production was largely

supported by the well-distributed rainfall from

2021 coupled with the ideal air temperature in the

main coconut growing areas. These favourable

effects outweighed the immediate negative impact

of limited application of chemical fertilisers on

coconut cultivation during 2022. Along with the

increased nut production, coconut-based products

also witnessed an improvement during the year.

Accordingly, the production of desiccated coconut

increased by 5.2 per cent, year-on-year, to 35,030

metric tons from 33,289 metric tons recorded in

2021. Coconut oil production increased notably

by 59.4 per cent, year-on-year, to 68,590 metric

tons in 2022, reflecting the restrictions imposed

on the importation of both coconut oil and palm

oil and the availability of adequate nuts for oil

production. Production of coconut milk powder

also increased during the year by 15.8 per cent,

year-on-year, while coconut cream and coconut milk

production recorded contractions of 12.5 per cent

and 0.9 per cent, respectively. Despite improved

performance of the coconut sector in 2022, the

lag effect of delayed and insufficient application of

chemical fertiliser in 2022 could affect the coconut

yield in the near future. However, the lag effect of

favourable precipitation received throughout 2022

is expected to outweigh the negative consequences

of insufficient fertiliser application.

Despite the improved coconut production,

prices of coconut and coconut based products

remained at elevated levels throughout 2022.

The average retail price of coconut increased by

8.9 per cent, year-on-year, to Rs. 91.36 per nut in

2022, with nut prices exceeding Rs.100.00 towards

late 2022, reaching historically high prices for

coconuts. The average auction price of coconut

at the Colombo Coconut Auction recorded at

Rs. 60.14 per nut in 2022, registering an increase

of 6.4 per cent from Rs. 56.51 per nut in 2021.

The desiccated coconut price in local markets also

increased marginally by 0.3 per cent, year-on-year,

to Rs. 538.75 per kilogramme during the year. The

average retail price of coconut oil per bottle of 750 ml

increased by 17.3 per cent to Rs. 520.19 in 2022

over an increase of 29.2 per cent recorded in 2021.

Further, the total export volume of desiccated

coconut, coconut oil, and copra registered a notable

growth in 2022, reflecting the favourable support

from the increased domestic production.

The Government’s efforts towards improving

the productivity of the coconut sector continued

during 2022, with the implementation of several

initiatives aimed at promoting the sector.

Accordingly, the Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB)

initiated several measures to provide high yielding

coconut cultivars to improve productivity in the

existing coconut lands. Development of a new

coconut seed garden to produce high yielding

'Kapsuwaya' hybrid coconut cultivar was underway

during the year, while the hand pollination programme

to produce 'Kapruwana' hybrid variety, and infilling

vacancies in the Kiniyama seed garden were also

carried out in collaboration with Chilaw Plantation

Ltd. Several subsidy schemes, including supply of

coconut seedlings at a subsidised rate, subsidies

for rehabilitation of coconut lands, replanting,

underplanting, and new planting, were also continued

in 2022. In light of the increased intensity of white fly

pest damage in 2022, a pilot project was conducted

to control white fly affected coconut plantations

in the areas, including Dankotuwa, Nattandiya

and Wennappuwa, while recommendations for

controlling white fly disease using chemicals and

bio-chemicals were also issued during the year.

Further, measures were taken to mitigate the impact

of fuel shortages on coconut processing factories by

supplying required fuel to ensure the uninterrupted

operation of such industries. Meanwhile, efforts

are being made to expand the global reach of the

'Ceylon Coconut' brand, which in turn will promote

value additions in the coconut industry and create

more opportunities in the global market for the

country’s coconut industry.

Minor Export Crops

The growth momentum of minor export

crop production continued in 2022, despite the

issues in domestic supply chains and fertiliser

availability. According to the provisional estimates

of the Department of Export Agriculture (DEA),

the production of minor export crops recorded a

notable increase of 30.6 per cent, year-on-year,

to 186,962 metric tons from 143,165 metric tons

recorded in 2021. The Government’s decision to

maintain restrictions on the importation of several

minor export crops, as a measure to curb import

expenditure amidst BoP pressures and combat the

rise of prices domestically amidst increased global

demand, spurred farmers to actively cultivate these

crops, resulting in a notable improvement in the

performance of the sector. In 2022, the production of

cinnamon, clove, cardamom, coffee, cocoa, nutmeg,

areca nut, and betel leaves witnessed a growth,

while the production of pepper declined. The total

export volume of the export agriculture crop sector

registered a year-on-year contraction of 7.0 per cent,

while export earnings, in rupee terms, increased

notably by 44.8 per cent, year-on-year. In 2022,

the earnings from exporting cinnamon recorded a

significant growth of 50.1 per cent, year-on-year,

largely contributing to the growth of export earnings

from export agriculture crops.

Several measures were undertaken by

the government authorities to strengthen the

minor export agriculture sector during the

year. Accordingly, in 2022, arrangements were

made by the Export Development Board (EDB)

with the support of several public and private

sector stakeholders to obtain Geographical

Indication (GI) certification for Ceylon cinnamon

from the European Union (EU) Commission.

This is expected to enhance the worldwide

recognition of the excellence and distinctive

features of the product, which can be attributed

to Sri Lanka. Further, DEA carried out research

and development activities to expand export

agriculture crop cultivation into non traditional

areas, such as Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa,

Ampara, Vavuniya, and Jaffna. Meanwhile,

DEA conducted various programmes aimed at

introducing minor export crops, like pepper, areca

nut, ginger, turmeric, and betel leaves in these

identified areas with the intention of expanding the

cultivation extent. In order to enhance the quality

of the production, introduction and popularisation

of organic cultivation, Good Agricultural Practices

(GAP), and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)

were also carried out during 2022.

Other Field Crops

Following a bumper harvest in 2021,

the production of other field crops (OFCs)

witnessed a notable decline largely driven

by the domestic shortages of fertiliser and

other agrochemicals and supply chain

disruptions. The drop in domestic production of

OFCs, amidst the lack of availability of fertiliser

and other agrochemicals, was largely mitigated

through imports, burdening the country’s import

expenditure during 2022. Accordingly, in 2022,

the overall production of OFCs decreased by 37.5

per cent, year-on-year, to 526,803 metric tons,

as a combined result of a 37.8 per cent decline in

production during the 2021/2022 Maha season and

a decline of 36.8 per cent in the 2022 Yala season.

Maize production registered a significant decline

of 45.2 per cent to 259,040 metric tons during

the year, compared to 2021, owing to shortages

and the high cost of agricultural inputs. With the

decline in domestic maize production, importation

of maize increased to 190,686 metric tons in

2022, from 22,724 metric tons in 2021, to fulfil

the demand for the animal feed industry. Potato

production registered a decline of 37.3 per cent,

year-on-year, to 47,614 metric tons in 2022, while

potato imports increased by 31.8 per cent over

2021. Further, big onion production decreased

2

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE, INCOME AND EMPLOYMENT

75

significantly by 73.0 per cent, year-on-year, to

17,799 metric tons, compared to the previous year,

and importation of big onions increased by 2.5

per cent, year-on-year, to 263,781 metric tons in

2022. Also, domestic production of OFCs, such as

finger millet (kurakkan), cowpea, and soya bean

recorded expansions during the year, while the

production of red onion, green gram, black gram,

ground nut, gingelly, and green chillies recorded

a decline. Meanwhile, the Government continued

its efforts to enhance the domestic production

of OFCs, to pave the way for improved food

security. Accordingly, the Field Crops Research

and Development Institute (FCRDI), functioning

under the Department of Agriculture (DoA),

instituted several measures during the year. These

measures include development of new varieties

of other field crops, such as chilli, onion, maize,

finger millet, cowpea, black gram, and green gram

through breeding programmes, maintenance of all

the recommended crop varieties, seed production

of recommended varieties, providing technical

recommendations for OFCs, soil testing services,

and technology dissemination. However, further

efforts are required to improve the supply of all

OFCs by implementing a national level OFC

production plan that encompasses measures to

ensure an adequate supply of agricultural inputs,

such as fertiliser and pesticides, promote high

quality seed production, and best soil and crop

management practices, while strengthening supply

chain channels to minimise foreign exchange

outflows for importation of OFCs that have the

potential to be produced domestically.

Vegetables

The supply of vegetables declined in 2022

owing to the combined impact of domestic

shortages of fertilisers and other agrochemicals,

supply chain disruptions, and increased cost

of production. The total production of vegetables

decreased by 4.9 per cent to 1,588,256 metric

tons in 2022, compared to 1,669,515 metric tons

recorded in 2021. During the 2021/2022

Maha season, the production of vegetables

contracted by around 6.5 per cent to 815,482

metric tons over the previous Maha season,

and the 2022 Yala production also declined

by around 3.1 per cent to 772,773 metric tons,

compared to the corresponding season of 2021.

Meanwhile, prices of vegetables continued to

remain elevated during 2022 on account of the low

production and transitory supply chain disruptions

caused by fuel shortages during the year. The

months of May and June 2022 witnessed a

significant surge in vegetable prices that can be

attributed to off-season cultivation and intensified

fuel scarcity. A slight moderation in vegetable

prices in the local markets was observed starting

from July 2022, due to the distribution of fuel for

the transportation of agricultural produce and the

arrival of seasonal harvests in the market during

August and September 2022. However, vegetable

prices remained broadly elevated towards the

latter part of 2022 due to the impact of heavy rain

and predicaments in storage and transportation

facilities. Meanwhile, 15,835 metric tons of

vegetables worth US dollars 26.7 million were

exported during 2022. During the year, several

measures were undertaken by the government

authorities to enhance domestic vegetable

production in a sustainable manner. Accordingly,

the Horticultural Crop Research and Development

Institute (HORDI) functioning under DoA

undertook several measures during the year,

including development of new vegetable varieties,

introduction of pest and disease resistant

vegetable varieties, management of soil fertility for

vegetable cultivation, technology developments for

management of pest and diseases in vegetable

cultivation, and promotion of vegetable preservation

and nutrient management programmes with the

aim of increasing productivity and efficiency of the

sector.

Fruits

According to the estimates of DCS, fruit

production recorded a mix performance during

2022. In 2022, production of fruits declined by

26.9 per cent over the previous year, with

significant contraction in the production of orange,

lime, rambutan, avocado, and melon, while mango,

papaya, plantain, and pineapple recorded increases

in production. During the year under review, 41,526

metric tons of fruits, including banana and papaw,

worth US dollars 37.6 million were exported, while

32,591 metric tons of fruits worth US dollars 42.2

million were imported. Despite the growing demand

for locally grown fruits due to limitations imposed by

the Government on the importation of several fruits

to curb import expenditure, the limited capacity

of local producers to meet domestic demand,

coupled with supply chain issues, hindered the

potential expansion of the domestic fruit sector.

The importance of improving the capacity of local

fruit producers, as well as the quality and safety

of fruits supplied to domestic and export markets

was reiterated due to the significant contribution

of the fruit sector to national economy in terms

of income and employment opportunities, as well

as the nutritional wellbeing of the population.

Promoting good agricultural practices, particularly

regarding the usage of agricultural inputs and

harvesting, establishing direct links between

producers and exporters, further developing the

contract farming system, minimising post-harvest

losses in the sector, and enabling improved

infrastructure for fruit preservation, storage, and

value addition, remain essential to improve the

productivity of the sector. Accordingly, several

measures were undertaken by the Government to

promote local fruit production sector. During the

year, the Fruit Research and Development Institute

(FRDI), functioning under DoA, was engaged

in consultations regarding the planting and

development of fruit plantation, providing advisory

services on production technologies for fruit crop

cultivation, diagnosing pest and disease, supplying

good quality planting materials of recommended

fruit varieties, and conducting several research

and development projects. Meanwhile, the Natural

Resources Management Centre of DoA completed

an assessment and mapping of potential areas

of cultivation of six fruit crops, including mango,

banana, pomegranate, pineapple, rambutan, and

durian with the financial and technical support of

FAO of the United Nations.

Sugar

The upward trend in sugar production

witnessed from 2019 was hampered in 2022

as the sugar industry experienced several

setbacks amidst domestic fertiliser shortages.

On a year-on-year basis, the total sugar production

recorded a contraction of 2.1 per cent to 78,857

metric tons in 2022, compared to 80,555

metric tons recorded in 2021. Contributing to

the annual decline in total sugar production,

the production of Sevanagala and Pelwatte

sugar factories, declined by 29.0 per cent and

20.6 per cent, respectively, during the period

under review. However, sugar production of

Gal Oya and Ethimale sugar factories recorded

year-on-year expansions of 27.4 per cent and

36.2 per cent, respectively, during 2022.

Meanwhile, the share of sugar production of the

Gal Oya, Sewanagala, Pelwatte, and Ethimale

accounted for 36.2 per cent, 16.0 per cent,

30.6 per cent, and 17.2 per cent of the total

domestic production, respectively. The total

extent of sugarcane cultivation (including ratoons)

managed by the four factories experienced a

marginal decline of 2.1 per cent during the year.

Meanwhile, the average yield of the four sugar

factories contracted by 11.1 per cent, reflecting

acute shortages of nutrients for cane cultivation.

Accordingly, the average yield stood at 59.7 metric

tons per hectare in 2022, compared to 67.2 metric

2

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE, INCOME AND EMPLOYMENT

77

tons per hectare recorded in 2021. According to

the Sugarcane Research Institute (SRI), as of

end 2022, only around 15.0 per cent of the total

domestic sugar requirement was met by domestic

production, with the remainder of the demand

being fulfilled through imports.

The Government continued to undertake

several initiatives aimed at strengthening

the local sugar industry, while reducing over

dependency on imports to meet domestic

sugar requirements. Recognising the vast

potential for local production and the need to

promote local sugarcane cultivation to meet the

domestic requirements, the SRI continued its

efforts aimed at developing the domestic sugar

industry. Taking into account the need to expand

cultivation areas and improve the factory capacity

as the top priorities for enhancing local sugar

production, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the

establishment of a new sugar factory, namely, Weli

Oya Sugar Factory, as a subsidiary of Lanka Sugar

Company (Pvt.) Ltd., in early 2022. Meanwhile, the

progress in relation to the re-establishment of the

Kantale sugar factory remained modest during the

year due to legal issues. Establishing a seed cane

multiplication nursery with a new variety, specially

released for jaggery production, at Vannerikulam,

Kilinochchi was also in progress during 2022.

Efforts were also initiated to develop a seed cane

policy for establishing a sustainable seed cane

production and supply chain, while establishing

a special task force to outline policy guidelines to

ensure the implementation of the domestic sugar

industry policy framework.

Livestock

The performance of the livestock sector

was hindered by the challenges posed by the

economic crisis in 2022. During the year, the

entire dairy value chain was severely impacted

by the scarcity and high cost of animal feeds

due to the limited importation of animal feeds,

unavailability of required chemical fertilisers for

pasture and fodder cultivation, and difficulties in

storage and transportation facilities caused by

the deepened foreign exchange liquidity crisis

in the economy. According to the estimates

of DCS, the total national milk production

declined by 1.3 per cent, year-on-year,

to 506 million litres in 2022, compared to 513

million litres recorded in 2021. Cow milk production

declined by 1.5 per cent, year-on-year, to 419 million

litres, whereas buffalo milk production recorded a

marginal contraction of 0.8 per cent, year-on-year,

to 87 million litres in 2022. Meanwhile, the

average cost of production of cow milk increased

notably to Rs. 80.50 per litre in 2022, from

Rs. 69.30 per litre recorded in 2021. Nevertheless,

due to increased demand for liquid milk, along with

shortages in imported and domestic milk powder

and a significant rise in milk powder prices, farmers

received a relatively high price for locally produced

liquid milk in both formal and informal milk markets

during the year. Accordingly, the average farm

gate price of a litre of cow milk increased by

17.3 per cent to Rs. 115.00 in 2022, from Rs. 98.00

in 2021. During 2022, the poultry sector continued

to grapple with issues related to inadequate feed

material for poultry rearing, following the reductions

in domestically produced feed ingredients, caused

by a notable drop in production of paddy and maize,

and restricted imports of feed material amidst

foreign currency liquidity issues. As a result, egg

production declined by 5.4 per cent, year-on-year,

to 1,849 million eggs in 2022, compared to

1,954 million eggs produced in 2021. As per the

Department of Animal Production and Health

(DAPH), the cost of production for egg increased

notably to Rs. 38.10 in 2022 from Rs. 18.07 in 2021.

Meanwhile, chicken production recorded a decline

of 3.7 per cent to 228,130 metric tons in 2022,

over 236,790 metric tons in 2021, while the cost of

production of chicken increased significantly from

Rs. 434.19 per kilogramme in 2021 to Rs. 965.66

per kilogramme during 2022. In 2022, despite

the Government’s imposition of price controls on

eggs and chicken, severe shortages in supplies,

particularly the egg supply, and resultant hoarding

of stocks, kept egg prices elevated throughout the

year. Further, on a year-on-year basis, production

of mutton increased by 9.2 per cent to 2,730 metric

tons, while pork and beef production declined by 5.3

per cent and 21.4 per cent, respectively, to 9,300

metric tons and 21,890 metric tons, respectively,

in 2022.

With due consideration to the contemporary

challenges encountered by the livestock

industry, efforts to enhance the productivity

of the sector were sustained throughout 2022.

Over the recent years, as Sri Lanka was almost

self-sufficient in egg and chicken production, the

domestic consumption requirements were largely

met through domestic production, while the

industry was advancing as a promising venture

for the export market. However, the unavailability

and elevated cost of feed material intensified

production constraints, leading to supply shortfalls

of these animal proteins. This situation challenged

the food security of the country. In this context,

the Government, in collaboration with DAPH,

undertook several measures to import maize and

other suitable grains for animal feed production

and promoted the domestic animal feed production

sector to reduce the strain on the country’s external

accounts. Further, DAPH carried out several

projects, including the livestock (dairy) breeding

project to increase milk production through the

upgrading of genetic potential of the existing

cattle population in Sri Lanka, the comprehensive

mastitis control programme to prevent and control

the clinical and subclinical mastitis, and vaccination

programmes for farm animals against the Foot

and Mouth Disease, Haemorrhagic Septicaemia,

Black Quarter, and Brucella diseases. Further, with

the financial assistance from the Department of

Agriculture of the United States, a Market‑Oriented

Dairy (MOD) Project was underway, aimed

at following the best practices to improve the

productivity of dairy manufacturers and quality of

their products.

Fisheries

The fisheries sector experienced a setback

during 2022 amidst challenges posed by the

economic fallout. Total fish production declined

by 8.9 per cent to 397,230 metric tons in 2022,

compared to the previous year, mainly driven by

the disruptions caused by domestic fuel shortages

on fishing activities and supply chains, particularly

in relation to marine fishing activities. Accordingly,

marine fish production, which accounted for about

71 per cent of the total fish production in 2022,

declined by 15.4 per cent, year-on-year, to 280,610

metric tons in 2022. However, the inland fishery

sector recorded an improvement during the year

due to the proper management of the water bodies

and increased fingerling stocking in reservoirs,

yielding a year-on-year increase of 11.9 per cent in

production during the year, compared to production

in 2021. Retail prices of fish varieties remained

broadly elevated in 2022 as a result of increased

2

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE, INCOME AND EMPLOYMENT

79

logistics costs, while upward revisions in kerosene

prices in August and November 2022 kept prices

at higher levels in the latter part of the year,

compared to the corresponding period of 2021.

According to the Ministry of Fisheries, total fish

exports contracted by 3.8 per cent, year-on-

year, reflecting the subdued performance of the

sector, whereas fish imports reported a year-

on-year contraction of 25.7 per cent, in volume

terms, during the period under review. Amidst

the energy crisis, the fishery sector encountered

several setbacks, prompting the Government to

take several measures to ensure the continuity of

fisheries activities during turbulent times, thereby

safeguarding the sector from severe economic

shocks and enhancing the performance of the

fishing industries. Accordingly, provisioning of

fuel for fishery activities was ensured by enabling

a manual system, while identifying filling stations

in major fisheries regions on a priority basis to

distribute limited fuel stocks.

Development activities pertaining to the

fisheries infrastructure base continued during

2022. Accordingly, the Ministry of Fisheries

continued to engage in several fisheries sector

development projects, while preventing illegal,

unreported, and unregulated fishing activities

to ensure sustainable fishing practices.

Construction of the Wellamankara fishery harbour

was completed in March 2022, and several

other harbour development projects, including

the Gandara fishery harbour, Balapitiya fishery

harbour, and Rekawa fishery harbour were

underway during 2022. A lagoon conservation

and development project, aimed at cleaning

and deepening several lagoons to increase the

natural fish population in coastal areas, was in

progress during the year, while measures were

taken to develop related infrastructure facilities

to reduce post-harvest losses. Meanwhile, the

National Aquaculture Development Authority

(NAQDA) continued its efforts to increase

inland fish and aquaculture production, which

contributes significantly to boost fish exports.

Three community based fish breeding units

were established in Ampara, Trincomalee, and

Kilinochchi to increase the supply of fish seed

required for reservoir stocking, and these units

are expected to provide a continuous supply of

carp fingerlings to the inland culture. During the

year, notable progress was made in upgrading

small scale fish seed production units for post

larvae rearing as well as the rehabilitation

and improvement of aquaculture development

centres to increase fish fingerling production. As

shrimp farming became one of the most lucrative

commercial aquaculture activities in the country,

initiatives were taken to expand shrimp farming in

all potential areas. Accordingly, measures were

implemented to promote shrimp culture activities

by introducing an efficient water recirculation

system and improving the biosecurity of farming

areas, while continuing the dredging of the

Dutch canal and establishment of an advanced

electricity supply for shrimp farms in the Puttalam

area. In addition to shrimp farming, sea weed, sea

bass, sea cucumber, and milk fish farming were

developed to promote commercial aquaculture

production. NAQDA facilitated community based

sea weed farming in the sea areas of Jaffna,

Kilinochchi, Mannar, and Puttalam. Measures

were taken to develop cluster based sea

cucumber farms in sea cucumber export villages

in Kilinochchi and Jaffna Districts, while plans

were underway to establish an aquaculture

zone in Mannar. NAQDA was involved in the

development of the ornamental fish industry,

including the development of new ornamental

fish strains, provision of brood stocks for

breeding, disease diagnosis facilities, training,

and technical assistance, aiming at increasing

high value ornamental fish production, thereby

boosting foreign exchange earnings. Further,

steps were taken by NAQDA to establish a marine

ornamental fish breeding centre in Bangadeniya.

Industry

The prolonged energy crisis and shortage

of key raw materials owing to the lack of

foreign exchange liquidity in the banking

system, together with the subdued demand

conditions prevailed due to the deterioration in

purchasing power, hindered Industry activities

during most parts of 2022. Even though policy

intervention helped control supply shortages

towards the latter part of the year, Industry

activities contracted by 16.0 per cent in 2022,

compared to the 5.7 per cent growth recorded in

2021 owing to multiple challenges emanated from

both domestic and external fronts. The subdued

performance in manufacturing and construction

activities led the contraction of Industry activities,

while mining and quarrying activities, and

electricity, gas, steam, and air conditioning supply

activities also significantly contracted, aggravating

the overall setback in Industry activities further.

However, water collection, treatment and supply

activities, and sewerage, waste treatment and

disposal activities expanded during the year,

positively contributing to overall Industry activities.

Reflecting these developments in Industry

activities, the Production and Demand sub-indices

of the BOS pertaining to the Industry indicated a

contraction on average during the year.

Manufacturing

All the manufacturing activities, except

the manufacture of textiles, wearing apparel

and leather-related products, which is largely

resilient to domestic shocks, contracted

during the year due to the adverse impact of

extended power cuts, shortages in fuel and

key raw materials, logistic issues, and subdued

demand conditions. Accordingly, value-added

of the overall manufacturing activities contracted

by 12.6 per cent in 2022, compared to the 7.4 per

cent growth recorded in 2021. The manufacture of

food, beverages and tobacco products, the largest

contributor to overall manufacturing activities,

contracted substantially by 14.2 per cent in 2022,

leading to this substantial contraction. Further,

manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products,

rubber and plastic products, and basic metals and

fabricated metal products were among the major

contributors to the decline in overall manufacturing

activities in value-added terms. Reflecting these

developments, the Index of Industrial Production

(IIP), compiled by DCS, and the Purchasing

Managers’ Index5 (PMI) for manufacturing

activities, compiled by the Central Bank, decreased

on average during the year.

5 PMI is a diffusion index compiled based on a perception survey which covers leading companies to capture monthly developments compared to the previous month.

Index of Industrial Production

The value addition from manufacturing

activities registered a negative growth in

2022, which can be attributed to a host of

adversities stemming from the unprecedented

economic crisis experienced by the Sri Lankan

economy. During the country’s worst economic

crisis on record, the manufacturing sector faced

multifaceted challenges, including shortages in raw

material, disrupted transport networks, interrupted

power supply, and soaring input prices, all of which

had an adverse impact on the performances of

the sector during the year. The overall market

demand was dampened during the year, amidst

the surge in inflation and the decreasing real

value of disposable income, further hindering

the performance of the manufacturing sector. As

reflected in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP),

the overall manufacturing sector, which accounted

for around 59 per cent of the total industry sector,

contracted by 12.1 per cent, year-on-year, in 2022,

compared to the year-on-year growth of 7.3 per

cent, in the previous year. Largely contributing to

the overall contraction in IIP, the subsectors of

manufacture of food products, textiles, coke and

refined petroleum products, other non-metallic

mineral products, rubber and plastic products, and

basic metal products reported notable contractions

during 2022. Nevertheless, the subsectors of

wearing apparel, chemical and chemical products,

beverages, tobacco products, leather and related

products, and machinery and equipment, which

contributed to around 30 per cent of the index,

recorded an overall growth during the year, despite

some transitory lapses observed occasionally.

Food manufacturing activities reported a

significant contraction in 2022, while beverage

manufacturing activities registered a robust

growth for the second consecutive year.

Accordingly, the food products subsector, which

accounts for over one third of the IIP, registered

a year-on-year contraction of 14.8 per cent in

2022, following the modest growth of 0.2 per cent

in 2021. The subdued performance of the food

products subsector was driven by the decline in

production of rice, canned fish, milk powder, wheat

flour, bread, and tea mainly with the crisis induced

disruptions in the supply chain and distribution

channels, increased cost of raw materials and

packaging materials, as well as the limited supply

of several food ingredients caused by import

restrictions. In contrast, the performance of the

manufacture of beverages subsector recorded a

notable expansion among all the other subsectors

of the IIP during the year, on account of the growth

in the production of arrack, beer, and soft drinks.

Accordingly, the beverage manufacturing activities

recorded a year-on-year growth of 20.3 per cent in

2022, over the year-on-year growth of 9.8 per cent

in 2021. Despite the overall positive performance

of the beverage manufacturing activities in 2022, a

slight moderation in the performance of the sector

was observed during the fourth quarter of 2022.

The manufacturing of wearing apparel,

which is the second largest subsector in the

IIP, recorded a favourable recovery in 2022,

largely supported by the recovery in global

supply chains, whereas the textiles subsector

witnessed a contraction. Accordingly, the

manufacturing of wearing apparel subsector

registered a year-on-year growth of 5.3 per

cent in 2022, compared to the notable growth of

17.5 per cent registered in 2021. The adverse

implications of import restrictions, logistics issues,

and power outages on the wearing apparel sector

were largely offset by several policy decisions

initiated by the Government. These included

allowing exporters to buy fuel directly from the

Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) using US

dollars and providing tariff concessions for several

raw material imports during the period under review.

Additionally, the depreciation of exchange rate and

the global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic,

especially in key export destinations of Sri Lanka,

positively impacted the exports of the wearing

apparel subsector. However, the manufacturing of

textile products, which recorded a robust recovery

in 2021 after the pandemic with a year-on-year

growth of 25.9 per cent, contracted significantly

by around 21.1 per cent in 2022 largely driven by

the decline in production of finished fabric, printing

fabric, and coir fiber.

The manufacture of other non-metallic

mineral products, the manufacture of basic

metals, and the manufacture of fabricated metal

products subsectors registered substantial

overall declines in 2022. Accordingly, the

subsector of manufacture of other non-metallic

mineral products, manufacture of basic

metals, and manufacture of fabricated

metal products which recorded over 20 per

cent year-on-year growths in 2021, contracted by

17.4 per cent, 34.1 per cent, and 42.2 per cent,

respectively, during the year. The contraction in

demand for products of these subsectors was

mainly due to the subdued demand from the

domestic construction sector, which faced multiple

setbacks following the suspension of government

funded projects, soaring raw material costs, and

import restrictions. The production of cement, roofing

sheets, floor tiles, and roofing tiles recorded notable

contractions during 2022, reflecting the subdued

demand from the construction sector, adversely

affecting the performance in the manufacturing of

other non-metallic mineral products. Meanwhile, the

declines in the production of basic iron and steel,

lead and steel furniture largely contributed to the

overall contraction in the subsector of manufacturing

of basic metals and manufacture of fabricated metal

products subsectors during the period under review.

The manufacture of coke and refined

petroleum products subsector, which accounted

for over 7 per cent of the IIP, witnessed a

contraction in 2022 for the third consecutive

year. Accordingly, the manufacture of coke and

refined petroleum products declined notably

by 57.8 per cent, year-on-year, registering the

historically largest annual contraction since 2016.

This decline was mainly driven by the prolonged

refinery shutdowns during the year due to limited

importation of crude oil amidst the dearth of

foreign exchange liquidity in the domestic market.

Accordingly, refined petroleum products, including

auto diesel, petrol and furnace oil declined in 2022.

However, the manufacture of coke and refined

petroleum product subsector recorded occasional

month-on-month increases in February, June,

August, September and December during the year.

Subsectors of manufacture of leather and

related products, and chemicals and chemical

products registered positive growths during

2022. The manufacture of leather and related

products subsector grew by 11.2 per cent, year-

on-year, in 2022, compared to the marginal growth

of 1.3 per cent in 2021, buoyed by the expansion

in finished leather, natural leather jackets and

shoes. Meanwhile, the manufacture of chemicals

and chemical products subsector also registered

an overall growth of 9.8 per cent, year-on-year.

Contributing to this growth, production of poly bags

and detergent powder expanded notably during the

year.

The manufacture of rubber and plastic

products subsector and the manufacture

of basic pharmaceutical products and

pharmaceutical preparations subsector

recorded contractions during the year. The

manufacture of rubber and plastic products, which

recorded a significant year-on-year expansion of

35.7 per cent in 2021 contracted by 9.9 per cent

in 2022. The contraction in the rubber and plastic

products subsector was primarily caused by the

decline in demand for medical rubber gloves

following the decline of COVID-19 cases both

locally and globally. Additionally, the reduction in

domestic manufacturing of tyres, zippers, rubber

sheets and block rubber also contributed to this

contraction. Meanwhile, the manufacture of basic

pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical

preparations sub-sector, which displayed

a gradual expansion since the onset of the

pandemic with the induced demand for

medicines and other health related products,

recorded a year-on-year contraction of 13.1 per

cent during 2022.

Other subsectors of IIP, including the

manufacture of wood products (except

furniture), electrical equipment, furniture,

paper and paper products, and printing and

reproduction of recorded media registered

contractions, whereas the manufacture of

tobacco products and machinery and

equipment subsectors recorded an expansion,

in 2022. On account of the decrease in the

production of corrugated paper, paper bags,

and exercise books, the manufacture of paper

and paper products subsector showed a tepid

performance in 2022. Accordingly, the paper and

paper products subsector reported a substantial

year-on-year drop of 43.4 per cent in 2022.

Printing and reproduction of the recorded media

subsector also witnessed a contraction of 4.9

per cent, year-on-year, mainly due to the supply

shortages during the period under review, along

with the decline in printing of currency notes,

and news papers compared to the previous

year. Overall performance in manufacturing of

electrical equipment was affected in 2022 due to

subdued demand for electric panel boards, and

coil devices. Nevertheless, the manufacture of

machinery and equipment sub-sector recorded a

year-on-year growth of 14.0 per cent during 2022,

compared to 18.6 per cent growth observed in

the previous year. Meanwhile, the manufacture of

tobacco products also grew by 6.8 per cent, year-

on-year, in 2022, recording an expansion for the

second consecutive year, supported mainly by the

increase in manufacturing of cigarettes.

Industrial Policies and Institutional Support

During the year, the Government continued

to support the growth and development of the

industrial sector through the implementation

of numerous policy initiatives, while assisting

the industrial sector to recover from the impact

of the pandemic followed by the economic

crisis. The Ministry of Industries finalised the

National Policy for Industrial Development (NaPID)

for 2023-2048 period, with a view to instituting a

comprehensive and holistic policy framework

for industrial sector development in Sri Lanka.

Further, NaPID aimed at establishing a national

industry base that is globally competitive and

promotes inclusive growth. In order to carry out

the activities in NaPID, strategic implementation

plans are expected to be prepared for the 5-year

periods, including an implementation framework,

mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation and

methodology for conducting periodical reviews. In

February 2023, the finalised NaPID, along with the

strategic implementation plan for the 2023-2027

period, was submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers

for approval. Meanwhile, the Cabinet of Ministers

approved in February 2022 the resumption of

production at Embilipitiya Paper Mills under a

Public Private Partnership (PPP) scheme, which

was discontinued in 2012. The project included an

investment of US dollars 16 million in its first phase

of development and is aimed at manufacturing

industrial grade papers for the direct and indirect

export markets by upgrading machinery and

infrastructure. The factory is expected to generate

an annual production of around 74,000 metric

tons of paper upon its expected completion in

2024. Activities pertaining to recommencing the

operations at the Kurunchathivu Saltern, under a

PPP model, were also underway during the year.

With the completion of this project, the saltern is

expected to produce an annual salt production

of around 30,000 metric tons. Furthermore, local

assembly of automobiles continued to expand

under the Standard Operating Procedures

(SOP) guidelines for automobile manufacturing,

assembling, and component manufacturing of

spare parts. At end of the period under review, 20

manufacturing companies were registered under

SOP, while 10,490 vehicles were assembled during

the year. In the meantime, the Sri Lanka Institute

of Biotechnology (SLIBTEC), in collaboration

with an international partner, undertook several

initiatives for the establishment of the Sri Lanka’s

first Biotechnology Innovation Park in 2022.

The park is envisaged to become the epicenter

of biotechnology innovation in the country and

attract both local and international investment to

Sri Lanka, thereby boosting Sri Lanka’s potential

for hi-tech exports. Meanwhile, the 'SME connect

platform', which was developed with the assistance

of the Asian Development Bank, was launched

under the purview of National Enterprise

Development Authority (NEDA) in October 2022.

This platform is expected to provide access

to knowledge, skills, and networking among

SMEs, with a particular focus on women-led

SMEs to improve women’s financial literacy and

business management capabilities. Moreover, the

'Nipunatha Udana Programme' was commenced

and progressed in the North Western province in

order to cater to vocational training requirements

of the region. Meanwhile, initiatives related to the

establishment of a German Technical College in

the Matara district were also in progress. However,

according to the National Budget Circular No.

03/2022, implementation of the promotional and

development activities related to the industrial

sector was curbed since April 2022, due to the tight

budgetary constraints of the Government.

The Export Development Board (EDB) and

the Board of Investment (BOI) initiated several

measures to attract foreign investment, while

actively promoting export oriented domestic

manufacturing industries. As proposed in the

Interim Budget for 2022, EDB implemented

measures to reactivate the 'National Packaging

Center', which aims at promoting and developing

indigenous packaging materials and designs

to cater to international markets. Further, EDB

developed a National Export Brand and a

promotional plan for the period 2022-2026 to

promote several earmarked export sectors in the

economy, including apparel, gem and jewellery,

electronic and electronic products, rubber and

rubber base products, and boat and boat building.

Further, a series of meetings was conducted during

the year by the export advisory committees, which

were appointed in 2021 under EDB, covering 24

key export sectors, to identify thematic priorities

to improve the performance of export sectors.

Moreover, promotional events, including trade fairs,

2

86

market linkage creating programmes, awareness

sessions, and capacity building programmes were also conducted targeting promotion of export oriented businesses during the year. Meanwhile, BOI established a new business partnership database to serve as a platform connecting local and international enterprises, assisting firms, research institutions, and start-ups in seeking suitable partners for their upcoming business proposals or innovations. Further, an 'Investor Facilitation Center' was implemented to streamline and expedite the investment approval process via strengthening the interagency coordination that enhances the ease of doing business for investors.

Other Government agencies continued to implement numerous initiatives to facilitate the domestic industrial sector. NEDA continued its efforts to promote the 'Made in Sri Lanka' brand that provides recognition to businesses using local resources. To this end, NEDA conducted district level and micro level trade fairs and opened the first 'Made in Sri Lanka' franchise shop in the Matale district. In 2022, NEDA conducted 1,292 entrepreneur training programmes and assisted in creating 957 businesses and 1,573 business expansions through its 'Regional Entrepreneurship Development Programme', while implementing cluster development programmes for several industrial clusters in the fields of food dehydration, bee honey, wood-apple and other seasonal products, jack fruit and rush reed, and palmyra. Meanwhile, the 'Industry 2022' national industrial exhibition was conducted by the Industrial Development Board (IDB) in February 2022, with the participation of 20 industries, that helped create new market and investment opportunities for local industrialists. Moreover, the 'Getup Startup for a Wealthy Nation' initiative was also commenced under IDB with the intention of spurring the country's industrial and entrepreneurial growth. This programme covered various aspects that promote entrepreneurship, including the 'Entrepreneurial Club' initiative for school students, 'Business Clinics' to address the problems faced by entrepreneurs, and a web-based

'Investor Pool' programme to direct investment towards SME industrialists. Moreover, the IDB mobile app and an emergency response number were introduced under this programme, creating a platform to facilitate close interaction between industrialists and IDB. Meanwhile, the National Productivity Secretariat (NPS) continued to conduct productivity improvement programmes aimed at empowering small-scale entrepreneurs across the country.

Industrial chambers continued to assist domestic SME industries in the country through training and engaging in promotional efforts. The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) continued to facilitate numerous trade delegations, networking events, international webinars, and discussion forums to promote trade and investment during the year. Further, under the theme of 'Business Tips for Trading Across Borders', CCC partnered with United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to bolster the trade knowledge of export oriented SMEs. The National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (NCCSL) remained committed to educating and empowering the SME sector, organising a range of training programmes island wide. NCCSL also entered into several Memoranda of Understanding with government authorities, regional chambers, and international organisations during 2022, aimed at networking for enhanced trade opportunities through promoting women’s entrepreneurship.

The Government’s initiatives towards promoting technological advancements persisted throughout the year. Complementing the overall efforts of the Government, the National Institute of Fundamental Studies (NIFS) formulated a technology transfer policy to facilitate the application of technology and research in the domestic manufacturing industries. Further, NIFS was in the process of promoting biodiesel production using algae for industrial purposes with the collaboration of a private sector company and introduced 'Biofilm' bio fertiliser to 280,000 acres of paddy fields in line with its agriculture

developments initiatives. Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Institute of Nanotechnology (SLINTEC) carried out research in key sectors, including energy, advanced materials, minerals, textile materials, and processes. Further, the National Innovation Agency actively participated in various activities throughout the year to encourage innovation-driven industrial development, with a special focus on the identifying gaps pertaining to the commercialisation of intellectual property in Sri Lanka. The National Science Foundation (NSF) continued to provide research grants to research scholars, facilitating

new product development initiatives during 2022.

The Government continued to facilitate industries to address economic crisis related issues, while ensuring the continuity of the industrial sector. To facilitate the continuation of industrial activities during the periods with acute fuel shortages, the Ministry of Industries initiated measures to issue recommendation letters for the supply of fuel required by industrial factories through the Sri Lanka Transport Board managed depots. Further, to support local manufacturers and ensure their ability to sustain operations, foreign exchange liquidity facilities were provided under the Indian line of credit, which enabled them to import necessary raw material. Meanwhile, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka requested licensed banks and non-bank financial institutions to provide appropriate credit concessions, on a case-by-case basis, for affected borrowers in all economic sectors, including the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector for a period of six months from July 2022, taking into account the adverse consequences of unprecedented macroeconomic stresses and the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, in fulfilling the liquidity requirement of SMEs, around US dollars 13.5 million of the undisbursed amount of the 'small and medium-sized enterprise line of credit' loan scheme was reallocated to the emergency response initiative by the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies. The primary objective of this reallocation was to provide affordable working

capital loans, at a rate determined on Average Weighted Deposit Rate (AWDR) plus a reasonable margin, to SMEs engaged in agriculture, tourism, and other export-oriented sectors. Moreover, considering the challenges faced by apparel manufacturers due to the surge in raw material prices, the Cabinet of Minister granted approval in August 2022 to provide tariff concessions on the importation of necessary accessories and items which are not manufactured locally.

Construction, and Mining and Quarrying

Construction activities suffered a severe setback in the wake of both supply and demand side impediments, resulting in a contraction of 20.9 per cent in 2022 in value-added terms, compared to the growth of 4.4 per cent reported in 2021. Shortages of raw materials and fuel, coupled with soaring input cost, lack of supplier credit and overdue payments on completed government-funded projects, led the supply side issues in the construction activities. This was exacerbated by demand side hindrances stemming from the suspension of government-funded projects and the high interest rate environment that curtailed private investments. The lacklustre performance in the construction industry was reflected in construction-related indicators as well. Accordingly, the total cement availability of the country recorded a substantial decline of 35.9 per cent in 2022, compared to the marginal decline of 0.8 per cent recorded in 2021 and building material imports also declined substantially by 35.8 per cent in 2022, compared to 4.7 per cent growth in 2021. Further, credit to the private sector granted by Licensed Commercial Banks for personal housing construction also recorded a contraction as of end-December 2022. Meanwhile, mining and quarrying activities comprised mainly the mining activities that provide inputs to construction activities, such as sand mining, also contracted by 31.0 per cent in 2022, compared to the growth of 1.4 per cent recorded in 2021. Further, reflecting the setback in gem mining, gem export volumes recorded a decline of 8.9 per cent in 2022.

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

Electricity, Water and Waste Treatment

The value-added of electricity, water and

waste treatment activities contracted by 4.3

per cent in 2022, compared to the 2.2 per

cent growth recorded in 2021, driven by the

decline in electricity and gas supply-related

activities. Accordingly, electricity, gas, steam

and air conditioning supply activities, which were

significantly disturbed by supply impediments and

upward price revisions during the year, contracted

by 5.9 per cent in 2022, compared to the growth of

4.9 per cent recorded in 2021. Meanwhile, during

the year, water treatment and supply activities,

and sewerage treatment and disposal activities

grew by 0.6 per cent and 3.9 per cent, respectively,

recovering from 17.8 per cent and 3.3 per cent

contractions recorded in 2021.

Services

Services activities, largely affected by the

prolonged energy crisis, limited availability of

goods and high inflation, contracted by 2.0 per

cent in 2022 in value-added terms, compared

to the growth of 3.5 per cent recorded in 2021.

The overall contraction was driven by the declines

in real estate, insurance, financial, human health

and professional services. Further, IT programming,

programming and broadcasting, and wholesale

and retail trade activities also contracted during

the year. However, accommodation, food and

beverage services grew significantly mainly due

to the post-pandemic recovery in tourist activities,

while transportation, telecommunication, education,

public administration, other personal services, and

postal and courier services also recorded positive

contributions. The PMI for Services activities,

compiled monthly by the Central Bank, mirrored the

developments in Services activities. Moreover, the

Demand and Sales sub-indices of BOS related to

the Services also indicated a contraction on average

during the year.

Wholesale and Retail Trade

Supply side impediments and subdued

demand conditions dampened wholesale

and retail trade activities resulting in a

marginal contraction of 0.2 per cent in 2022 in

value-added terms, compared to the 1.5 per

cent growth recorded in 2021. Supply setbacks

stemming from the lower harvest of the Maha

2021/22 season, import restrictions that resulted

in a considerable contraction in import volumes,

including consumer goods imports, and disruptions

to fuel supply adversely affected trade activities

during most periods of the year. Further, subdued

demand conditions caused by the deterioration

in purchasing power under the high inflationary

environment, increase in taxes and utility tariffs,

and demoralised consumer credit with high interest

rates aggravated the situation, especially during

the second part of the year.

Transportation and Storage

The value-added of transportation and

storage activities grew by 3.5 per cent in

2022, compared to the marginal growth of

0.9 per cent recorded in 2021, mainly due to

the post-pandemic recovery. Considering the

transportation-related indicators, the passenger

kilometres operated by the Sri Lanka Transport

Board, private bus operators and Sri Lanka

Railways increased considerably in 2022, reflecting

the increased demand for public transportation

modes amidst significantly higher fuel costs, and

preferential supply of fuel for public transportation.

Moreover, air transportation services gradually

recovered with the revival of tourism activities, as

evidenced by the increase in passenger kilometres

flown by the SriLankan Airlines during the year.

However, in relation to port-related activities,

container handling (in terms of Twenty-Foot

Equivalent Units) and cargo handling contracted

during the year, mainly due to the slowdown in

global trade volumes.

Accommodation and Food Service Activities

Accommodation, food and beverage service

activities, which were severely affected by the

Easter Sunday attacks and subsequently due to

the COVID-19 pandemic, recorded a substantial

growth of 27.0 per cent in 2022, compared

to the 1.7 per cent growth recorded in 2021.

The significant increase in tourist arrivals on a

year-on-year basis bolstered these activities

despite the disruptions caused by energy shortages

and social unrest. In order to facilitate tourists in

the turbulent environment, many hotels offered

exclusive packages, including complimentary

transport facilities, especially during the period

in which the fuel shortage prevailed. Further,

the depreciation of the local currency made Sri

Lanka more attractive as a holiday destination

for foreign tourists. However, the exaggerated

negative portrayal of the Sri Lankan economic

crisis circulated by certain international media

and cautious travel advisories issued by several

foreign governments hindered the growth potential

of the tourism industry during the year. Further,

limited fuel availability under the QR code system

prevented local tourists from travelling long

distances.

Financial, Insurance and Real Estate Activities including Ownership of Dwellings

The value-added of financial, insurance, and

real estate activities, including ownership of

dwellings, contracted by 15.4 per cent in 2022,

compared to 7.5 per cent growth in 2021, on

account of significant contractions reported in

the value added of all three activities. The high

interest rate environment lowered overall demand

for credit, while higher price levels prevailed during

the period hampered the value added of these

services when considered at constant prices.

Further, as revealed by the Credit Supply Survey

conducted by the Central Bank on a quarterly

basis, the willingness to lend declined mainly due

to the deterioration of the repayment capacity of the

borrowers under high inflationary environment and

weaker economic conditions. Accordingly, financial

services activities and auxiliary financial services

contracted by 11.0 per cent in 2022, compared to 7.0

per cent growth in 2021, while real estate activities

including ownership of dwellings contracted by 12.1

per cent during the year, compared to 4.4 per cent

growth in the previous year. Meanwhile, insurance,

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

90

reinsurance, and pension funding activities also

contracted significantly by 47.2 per cent in 2022,

compared to the growth of 26.4 per cent recorded

in 2021, mainly due to the subdued performance in

pension funding activities.

Information and Communication

Telecommunication, and IT programming

and consultancy services activities which

outperformed many other economic activities

during the pandemic, contracted marginally

by 0.3 per cent in 2022 in value-added terms,

compared to the substantial growth of 21.0 per

cent recorded in 2021 with the normalisation

of the pandemic-induced demand prevailed in

previous years, and slowdown in domestic and

foreign economies. Interruptions to electricity and

fuel supply, and shortage of technological products

also hampered these activities. Accordingly, IT

programming consultancy and related activities, the

main contributor in the segment, contracted by 2.3

per cent in 2022, compared to 25.2 per cent growth

recorded in 2021, affected by the slowdown in global

demand and domestic supply side issues such as

prolonged power cuts that prevailed during the period.

Meanwhile, Telecommunication activities grew at a

slower rate of 3.1 per cent in 2022, compared to the

14.2 per cent growth recorded in 2021, attributable to

the subdued demand resulted from the deterioration

in purchasing power amid higher inflationary

conditions and the upward revision of taxes imposed

on telecommunication services.

Other Services Activities

The value-added of most of the other services

activities also contracted in 2022, affected by the

adverse economic conditions that prevailed in

the country. Most of these activities were dampened

due to the supply shortages during the first half;

however, the same were affected in the latter part

of the year by the subdued demand conditions.

Accordingly, professional services, and programming

and broadcasting activities contracted by 4.0 per cent

and 11.0 per cent, respectively, in 2022, due to the

comparatively unfavourable business environment.

Further, human health activities, which grew at a

higher rate during the COVID-19-affected years,

contracted by 8.4 per cent in 2022. Meanwhile,

education, public administration and defense, other

personal services, and postal and courier services

contributed positively to the overall economic growth

in 2022.

2.5 Expenditure

Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE), the

combination of consumption and investment

expenditure of the economy, grew at a higher rate

of 32.3 per cent at current prices in 2022, largely

on account of elevated price levels that prevailed

during the year, compared to the 13.6 per cent

growth recorded in 2021. Within GDE, consumption

expenditure grew by 34.3 per cent during the year,

compared to 8.4 per cent growth in 2021, while

investment expenditure also grew by 28.4 per cent

during the year, compared to the 25.1 per cent growth

recorded in the previous year. On the external front,

net external demand at current prices improved by

34.1 per cent in 2022, in contrast to the 34.7 per cent

deterioration recorded in the previous year. This was

due to the substantial growth of 74.1 per cent in the

export of goods and services during the year, which

surpassed the 41.2 per cent growth in the import of

goods and services. The comparatively slower growth

in imports was largely attributable to the decline in

import volumes due to import restrictions and foreign

exchange liquidity shortage, while exports benefited

from the sharp depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee

against currencies of major export destinations.

Accordingly, GDP at current prices, the aggregate of

GDE, and net external demand recorded a growth

of 37.2 per cent in 2022, compared to 12.3 per cent

growth in 2021.

GDE, at constant prices, contracted

substantially, largely attributable to the

deterioration in purchasing power, the high

interest rate environment that discouraged

both consumption and investment, and the

scarcity of goods. Accordingly, both consumption

and investment declined by 7.5 per cent and 24.9

per cent, respectively, in 2022, resulting in a 13.2

per cent contraction in GDE during the year,

compared to the 2.7 per cent growth recorded in

2021. Meanwhile, net external demand at constant

prices turned positive with a substantial growth

of 101.1 per cent in 2022 due to the combined

outcome of the increase in exports and decline

in imports in volume terms. Consequently, GDP

at constant prices contracted by 7.8 per cent in

2022, compared to 3.5 per cent growth in 2021.

Consumption

Consumption expenditure, the largest

expenditure component of the economy, grew

by a higher rate of 34.3 per cent at current prices

in 2022, compared to the 8.4 per cent growth

recorded in 2021, mainly due to the surge in

consumer prices. Private Consumption Expenditure

(PCE), the major component of consumption

expenditure, substantially grew during the year

accounting for 89.7 per cent of the total consumption

in 2022. Meanwhile, the Government Consumption

Expenditure (GCE) also grew at a higher pace

compared to the previous year, contributing to the

total consumption growth.

Outpacing the contraction in household

consumption in real terms with the deterioration

in purchasing power of the consumers and the

supply shortages, PCE at current prices grew

by 39.0 per cent in 2022, compared to 9.4 per

cent growth in 2021, driven by inflated prices.

In this regard, notable contributions could be

observed from the major PCE categories of food and

non-alcoholic beverages, and transport, which grew

by 25.9 per cent and 69.8 per cent, respectively,

during the year. The price levels of imported

consumer items increased significantly in 2022,

led by the increase in global commodity prices and

depreciation of the local currency, contributing to

the substantial increase in PCE at current prices.

Moreover, the upward revisions of energy prices

increased the household expenditure, particularly on

transport, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, which

spilled over to most of the PCE categories.

GCE, which comprises individual and

collective final consumption expenditure of

the Government, grew by 3.8 per cent in 2022

at current prices, compared to the 2.3 per

cent growth recorded in 2021. Accordingly,

the Government’s individual final consumption

expenditure, the main GCE category comprising

expenditure on health, education, social protection,

and recreation and culture, grew by 5.6 per cent

during the year, compared to 1.0 per cent growth

in 2021. Moreover, the Government’s collective

final consumption expenditure, which comprises

expenditure that collectively benefit the community

as a whole, such as general public services,

defence, and public order and safety, grew by 1.7

per cent in 2022, a slower rate compared to 3.9 per

cent growth in 2021.

Investment

Investment expenditure at current prices

grew by 28.4 per cent in 2022, compared

to 25.1 per cent growth in 2021, due to the

significant elevation in prices of investment

goods, even though investment in real terms

recorded a notable contraction. The investment

climate faced strong headwinds during the year

attributable to the scarcity and increased cost of

investment goods due to the shortage in foreign

exchange and the sharp depreciation in the

local currency, holdback of government-funded

construction projects, and high interest rates

environment. However, at current prices, gross

fixed capital formation, the major contributor to

investment expenditure, grew by 21.9 per cent,

compared to the 15.8 per cent growth recorded

in the previous year, reflecting the impact of

increased prices of construction material, and

machinery and equipment. In the meantime,

changes in inventories and acquisition less

disposals of valuables also increased during the

year.

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows,

including loans received by companies

registered under BOI, increased notably by

37.9 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars

1,075.66 million in 2022, compared to US

dollars 780.2 million recorded in 2021. FDI

6 This includes receipts, including loans, to companies registered with the BOI and differs from the estimates presented in Chapter 5, mainly due to the inclusion of FDIs to non-BOI companies in the latter. Accordingly, total FDIs amounted to US dollars 1,181 million in 2022.

inflows to infrastructure projects, which accounts

for around 54.0 per cent of the total FDI inflows

to BOI companies, showed a notable increase in

2022, largely contributing to the overall expansion

in FDIs in 2022. Further, FDIs to the manufacturing

sector and services sector, which account for

about 34.0 per cent and 13.0 per cent of FDI

inflows, respectively, also recorded expansions.

However, FDI inflows to the agriculture sector

continued to remain modest in 2022. The total

value of projects approved during the year by the

BOI, under Sections 16 and 17 of the BOI Act.

No. 4 of 1978, was estimated at Rs. 546.4 billion,

depicting an expansion of 6.3 per cent,

year-on-year, from Rs. 514.1 billion in the

preceding year. The estimated investment

value of projects that commenced commercial

operations under Sections 16 and 17 of the BOI

Act, amounted to Rs. 35.8 billion and Rs. 1,667.4

billion, respectively, during 2022.

Availability and Utilisation of Resources

The available resources of the economy,

which include domestic resources

represented by the GDP and external

resources represented by the imports, grew

at a higher rate of 38.0 per cent at current

prices in 2022, compared to the 14.8 per cent

growth recorded in 2021. In this regard, GDP

grew by 37.2 per cent in 2022, while imports grew

by 41.2 per cent during the year, both at higher

rates compared to 2021. However, considering

the constant price estimates, GDP and imports

recorded contractions during 2022. Meanwhile,

most of the available resources were utilised

for consumption purposes, which accounted for

The country’s domestic and national savings

improved at current prices during the year.

Accordingly, domestic savings grew by 44.2 per

cent in 2022, compared to the 22.9 per cent growth

recorded in 2021, driven by the increase in private

savings despite the broadening of government

dis-savings during the year. As a result, domestic

net primary income from the rest of the world

deteriorated during the year, while net current

transfers from the rest of the world recorded an

improvement. As a combined outcome of these

developments, national savings grew by 37.6 per

cent in 2022, compared to 17.7 per cent growth in

2021. Due to the higher growth in savings compared

to the investment, the national savings-investment

gap narrowed in 2022.

2.6 Income

Gross Mixed Income, the largest income

component of the economy in 2022, grew

by 45.4 per cent at current prices during the

year, compared to the growth of 11.2 per cent

recorded in 2021, accounting for 34.6 per cent

of GVA. Meanwhile, Gross Operating Surplus, the

second largest income component, grew by 36.0

per cent in 2022, compared to the growth of 17.3

per cent in 2021. In terms of other major sources

of income, Compensation of Employees and Other

Taxes less Subsidies on Production continued to

expand during the year. Meanwhile, considering

the institutional sector classification of GVA, NFC

was the largest income generator, followed by HH

and NPISH, GG, and FC, respectively.

2.7 Population, Labour Force and Employment

Population

The population continued to increase

in 2022, yet at a slower rate compared to

the previous year. Accordingly, the mid-year

population in Sri Lanka was estimated at 22.181

million in 2022 as per the mid-year population

estimates compiled by the Registrar General’s

Department, recording a marginal growth of 0.1

per cent, compared to the growth of 1.1 per cent in

2021. Meanwhile, the Western Province continued

to account for the highest share of 28.0 per cent

of the mid-year population in 2022, yet recording a

year-on-year decline in population, followed

by the Central and Southern Provinces, which

represented 12.7 per cent and 12.2 per cent, of

the population, respectively, in 2022. Further, the

Northern Province continued to account for 5.3

per cent, the lowest share of mid-year population,

in 2022. In line with the population growth, the

population density also increased marginally to

354 people per square kilometre in 2022, from

353 people per square kilometre recorded in 2021.

Following the trend observed in recent years, the

female population remained higher than the male

population.

Labour Force

In 2022, the economically inactive population

increased compared to 2021 resulting in a

decrease in the labour force as per the Sri

Lanka Labour Force Survey conducted by DCS.

In line with the increase in household population,

the economically inactive population increased

to 8.615 million in 2022 from 8.581 million in the

previous year whereas the labour force, which

represents the economically active population,7

decreased marginally to 8.547 million in 2022

from 8.553 million recorded in 2021. With these

developments, the labour force participation

rate (LFPR), which is the ratio of the labour

force to the household population, decreased

marginally to 49.8 per cent in 2022, compared to

49.9 per cent in 2021. The male LFPR recorded a

decline to 70.5 per cent in 2022 from 71.0 per cent

in the previous year, while on a positive note the

female LFPR increased to 32.1 per cent in 2022

from 31.8 per cent in the previous year. Further,

the gender gap in LFPR narrowed to 38.4 per cent

in 2022, compared to the 39.2 per cent recorded in

the previous year.

Employment

The employed population8 increased to

8.148 million in 2022, compared to 8.114 million

in the previous year. In terms of employment

by major economic activities, employment in

Industry activities increased to 2.158 million in

2022 from 2.109 million in the previous year,

while that of Services increased to 3.831 million

in 2022 from 3.791 million in the previous year.

However, employment in Agriculture declined

to 2.159 million in 2022 from 2.213 million in

the previous year. Accordingly, the shares of

employment in Industry and Services activities

increased to 26.5 per cent and 47.0 per cent,

respectively, in 2022 from 26.0 per cent and 46.7

per cent in the previous year, whereas the share

of employment in Agriculture declined to 26.5 per

under all skill categories, namely professional,

middle level, clerical and related, skilled,

semi-skilled, unskilled and housemaid, increased

with major contributions from unskilled, skilled and

Rs. 686.57 per hour worked in 2022 from

their respective GVA in 2022. Accordingly, labour

productivity in Industry and Services activities

activities broadly remained unchanged amid the

decline in both Agriculture GVA and the hours

worked. Accordingly, the labour productivity in

Agriculture activities recorded as Rs.243.94 per

hour worked in 2022, compared to 243.04 in

2021. In terms of the level of productivity, Services
