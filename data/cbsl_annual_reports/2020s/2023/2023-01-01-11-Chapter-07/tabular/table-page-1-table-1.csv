"7.1 Overview"
"addressing unprecedented vulnerabilities in the external sector amidst the worst balance of payments (BOP) 
The Central Bank tightened the monetary policy stance significantly during 2022 aimed at countering the"
"stresses experienced in the post-independence economy and in offsetting the impact of the anomalous interest"
"rate  structure  due  to  rising  risk  premia  of  yields  on  government  securities  amidst  growing  concerns  about"
"domestic debt restructuring. Price pressures spiralled up during the year due to a multitude of factors, including"
"domestic supply side disruptions, long overdue adjustments to administrative prices in response to the hikes"
"in global oil and commodity prices and their spillovers, faster passthrough of the significant depreciation of the"
"currency,  and  lagged  impact  of  monetary  accommodation  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  among  others."
"Reflecting the impact of the tight monetary policy stance, liquidity in the domestic money market remained"
"in deficit, with elevated lending and deposit interest rates, thereby constraining the expansion of money and"
"credit.  Especially,  market  lending  and  deposit  interest  rates  rose  notably  within  a  span  of  a  few  months,"
"reflecting the rapid passthrough of tight monetary policy, large liquidity deficit levels, and elevated risk premia."
"In response, the expansion of broad money supply and credit slowed significantly, with credit obtained by the"
"private sector suffering the most, as reflected by the continuous month-on-month contraction since June 2022."
"The impact of tight monetary conditions and improvements on the supply side with the abating BOP pressures"
"helped  contain  price  pressures  towards  late  2022.  Headline  inflation  peaked  in  September  2022  and  has"
"been on a steady disinflation path since then. However, credit extended to the Government by the banking"
"system remained considerably high during the year amidst subdued government revenue and limited access"
"to foreign financing following the external debt standstill announcement in April 2022. The persistently large"
"government  borrowing  requirement,  together  with  concerns  about  domestic  debt  restructuring,  caused  the"
"yields on government securities to soar and remained at extraordinarily high levels during the year, although"
"some  moderation  was  observed  towards  late  2022  with  improving  market  sentiments  on  the  successful"
"finalisation  of  the  Extended  Fund  Facility  (EFF)  arrangement  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)."
"Meanwhile, market deposit interest rates as well as short term market lending interest rates began to decline"
"gradually, in line with the monetary policy communication of the Central Bank that underscored the need to"
"bring down excessive interest rates that moved alongside the yields on government securities. Further, the"
"Central  Bank  initiated  measures  to  ease  liquidity  stresses  in  the  money  market  by  providing  liquidity  on  a"
"long term basis, while reducing the banks' overreliance on standing facilities, thereby facilitating the gradual"
"downward movement of the interest rate structure, which has overly responded with a disproportionate upward"
"adjustment,  compared  to  the  magnitude  of  policy  interest  rate  tightening  thus  far.  Meanwhile,  the  Central"
