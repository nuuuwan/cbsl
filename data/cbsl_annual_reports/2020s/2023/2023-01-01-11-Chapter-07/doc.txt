7.1 OverviewT

he Central Bank tightened the monetary policy stance significantly during 2022 aimed at countering the soaring price pressures and persistent acceleration of inflation, while anchoring inflation expectations and reining in underlying demand pressures. Such tightening of monetary policy was warranted in addressing unprecedented vulnerabilities in the external sector amidst the worst balance of payments (BOP) stresses experienced in the post-independence economy and in offsetting the impact of the anomalous interest rate structure due to rising risk premia of yields on government securities amidst growing concerns about domestic debt restructuring. Price pressures spiralled up during the year due to a multitude of factors, including domestic supply side disruptions, long overdue adjustments to administrative prices in response to the hikes in global oil and commodity prices and their spillovers, faster passthrough of the significant depreciation of the currency, and lagged impact of monetary accommodation during the COVID-19 pandemic, among others. Reflecting the impact of the tight monetary policy stance, liquidity in the domestic money market remained in deficit, with elevated lending and deposit interest rates, thereby constraining the expansion of money and credit. Especially, market lending and deposit interest rates rose notably within a span of a few months, reflecting the rapid passthrough of tight monetary policy, large liquidity deficit levels, and elevated risk premia. In response, the expansion of broad money supply and credit slowed significantly, with credit obtained by the private sector suffering the most, as reflected by the continuous month-on-month contraction since June 2022. The impact of tight monetary conditions and improvements on the supply side with the abating BOP pressures helped contain price pressures towards late 2022. Headline inflation peaked in September 2022 and has been on a steady disinflation path since then. However, credit extended to the Government by the banking system remained considerably high during the year amidst subdued government revenue and limited access to foreign financing following the external debt standstill announcement in April 2022. The persistently large government borrowing requirement, together with concerns about domestic debt restructuring, caused the yields on government securities to soar and remained at extraordinarily high levels during the year, although some moderation was observed towards late 2022 with improving market sentiments on the successful finalisation of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Meanwhile, market deposit interest rates as well as short term market lending interest rates began to decline gradually, in line with the monetary policy communication of the Central Bank that underscored the need to bring down excessive interest rates that moved alongside the yields on government securities. Further, the Central Bank initiated measures to ease liquidity stresses in the money market by providing liquidity on a long term basis, while reducing the banks' overreliance on standing facilities, thereby facilitating the gradual downward movement of the interest rate structure, which has overly responded with a disproportionate upward adjustment, compared to the magnitude of policy interest rate tightening thus far. Meanwhile, the Central

7.2 Monetary Policy Stance

The Central Bank continued the tight

monetary policy stance that commenced

in August 2021 through 2022 in view of

arresting inflationary pressures and possible

de-anchoring of inflation expectations. By

considering the significant acceleration of inflation

in the country and the large anomaly that existed

between policy interest rates and market interest

rates amidst external and fiscal sector imbalances,

the Central Bank’s key policy interest rates, i.e.,

the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and

the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR), were

raised by 10 percentage points till end 2022, since

the monetary tightening cycle that began in August

2021, and a larger portion of that adjustment, i.e.,

7 percentage points, took place in April 2022. The

extended period of monetary accommodation

since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in

early 2020 and a sharp depreciation of the Sri

Lanka rupee against the US dollar during March

2022 resulted in significant upside risks to the

inflation outlook, compelling the Central Bank to

raise policy interest rates by 7 percentage points

in April 2022 and a further 100 basis points in

July 2022. Such tightening of monetary conditions

helped arrest the build-up of demand driven

inflationary pressures and preempt the escalation

of adverse inflationary expectations, as well as

Bank increased the policy interest rates in March 2023 in fulfilling the remaining ‘prior action’ of the IMF-EFF arrangement. This helped lower the spread between policy interest rates and market interest rates further. Notwithstanding this increase in policy interest rates, the declining trend of market interest rates continued in keeping with the market guidance provided by the Central Bank since late 2022. Reflecting the impact of monetary policy and other measures, headline inflation is expected to return to a single digit level towards late 2023 and remain within the targeted level over the medium term. Most importantly, the downward adjustment of the market interest rates observed thus far is expected to continue in the period ahead, supported by declining inflation and more clarity that may become available on the options for domestic debt optimisation and the resultant reduction in high risk premia attached to the yields on government securities. This would help ease the significant tightness in monetary conditions and foster a gradual turnaround in credit to the private sector. Meanwhile, the expected enactment of the new Central Bank legislation is envisaged to provide further impetus in implementing monetary policy in the absence of fiscal dominance.

ease pressures on the external sector, while

correcting the anomaly observed in the interest

rate structure. In addition, maximum interest rates

imposed on selected lending products as well as

foreign currency deposits were removed, enabling

the effective passthrough of policy interest rate

changes to tighten monetary conditions. In order

to support the tight monetary policy stance,

overnight liquidity in the domestic money market

was maintained at negative levels during 2022,

although liquidity required for the operations of the

money market was availed through the Standing

Lending Facility (SLF). Liquidity in the domestic

money market turned significantly negative during

mid-2022 mainly due to the impact of foreign

exchange transactions by the Central Bank in

facilitating essential imports and external debt

service payments of the Government. However,

a gradual reduction of large negative liquidity

levels was observed thereafter as a result of the

primary market purchases of Treasury bills by the

Central Bank to support the cashflow requirements

of the Government and the return of currency to

the banking system given the attractive deposit

interest rates. Yields on government securities

increased significantly during the year till around

November 2022 driven by the sharp increase

in the policy interest rates and elevated risk

premia attached to government securities amidst

uncertainties associated with debt restructuring

concerns. Reflecting a faster passthrough of tight

monetary conditions, market interest rates rose

significantly with most reaching historically high

levels. However, this upward adjustment in market

interest rates was disproportionate to the rise in

policy interest rates due to the influence of the high

risk premia attached to government securities on

other market interest rates. This warranted some

moral suasion by the Central Bank from November

2022 requesting banks to reduce overly excessive

lending and deposit interest rates. Nonetheless,

retail market interest rates remained high during

2022, despite some moderation observed from

late 2022, in line with repeated requests by the

Central Bank on the need to reduce excessive

market interest rates, which were maintained at

levels way above the policy interest rates. Growth

of credit extended to the private sector by the

banking system continued to moderate reflecting

the tight monetary conditions and the moderation

of overall economic activity amidst unprecedented

economic stresses. Meanwhile, outstanding credit

to the private sector contracted on a monthly basis

from June 2022 through February 2023, reflecting

the largest spell of contraction of credit on record.

Consequently, the year-on-year growth of credit

to the private sector moderated to 6.2 per cent by

end 2022 and slowed further to 3.0 per cent by

end February 2023, recording the lowest growth

since July 2020. However, credit obtained by

State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs) from

the banking system expanded during the year,

partly reflecting the impact of the depreciation

of the exchange rate. Further, Net Credit to the

Government (NCG) by the banking system also

increased during 2022, driven mainly by NCG from

the Central Bank amidst large scale monetary

financing. The Central Bank was compelled to

provide such monetary financing as a temporary

measure to ease pressures on the government

cashflow amidst dwindling foreign financing and

revenue shortfalls. A large part of such monetary

financing was routed back to the Central Bank

to purchase foreign exchange needed to honour

foreign currency debt servicing to multilateral

lending agencies. However, new monetary

financing would be restricted under the proposed

Central Bank Act, thereby reinforcing monetary

policy autonomy in the period ahead. Meanwhile,

the Central Bank continued to maintain its tight

monetary policy stance thus far in 2023 to ensure

that underlying inflation and inflation expectations

remain sufficiently restrained. However, the

Central Bank provided liquidity on a long-term basis

through open market operations in order to contain

excessive pressures on market interest rates

due to large deficit levels in the domestic money

market for an extended period. Further, in order

to promote activity in the domestic money market,

which was hampered due to the large asymmetry in

liquidity distribution, the Central Bank implemented

regulatory actions limiting access to the standing

facilities of the Central Bank effective mid-January

2023, thereby reducing the overdependence of

Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) on standing

facilities. Consequently, overnight liquidity in

the domestic money market and activity in the

interbank call and repo markets improved. Along

with these developments and the improvement

in investor sentiment with the finalisation of the

IMF-EFF arrangement, yields on government

securities and other retail market interest rates

commenced easing gradually, thereby easing

monetary conditions to some extent, while

narrowing the disorderly upward adjustment

in market interest rates. Meanwhile, given the

necessity of fulfilling all the ‘prior actions’ and

to move forward with the finalisation of the EFF

arrangement, amidst some differences in inflation

projections of the Central Bank and the IMF staff,

a consensus was reached in early March 2023 to

raise the policy interest rates, by a notably lower

magnitude, compared to the level of adjustment

envisaged during the initial stage of negotiations.

Accordingly, policy interest rates were increased

by 100 basis points with effect from the close of

business on 03 March 2023. This adjustment

helped further narrow the spread between the

policy interest rates and elevated market interest

rates, while the moderation of market interest rates

is expected to continue in the period ahead as

more information becomes available with regard to

the debt restructuring strategy of the Government.

While such downward adjustment of the interest

rate structure would help ease the unprecedented

burden on small and medium scale businesses to

stay afloat under extremely challenging economic

circumstances, this is not expected to ease

monetary conditions to levels that could generate

inflationary pressures as economic activity already

remained subdued.

The Central Bank’s monetary policy

communication strategy in 2022 remained

aligned with the tight policy stance that was

maintained throughout the year, while reiterating

its commitment to restoring price stability amidst

historic high levels of inflation. Monetary policy

communication during a high inflation episode was

extremely challenging, particularly amidst the lack

of public confidence in the economy. Premature and

ill-conceived statements by some commentators about

the direction of inflation and interest rates, including

some reference to possible hyperinflation, prolonged

economic crisis, etc., caused confusion among the

public. The sharp adjustment of policy interest rates in

April 2022 necessitated efficient policy communication

to educate the public on the need for such adjustment

and curb worsening inflation expectations. The

over-adjustment of market interest rates, including

the yields on government securities, mainly due to

uncertainty over domestic debt restructuring under the

IMF-EFF arrangement, highlighted the importance

of frequent and clear communication to the public. In

implementing its communication policy, the Central

Bank continued to use conventional channels as well

as social media and digital platforms. Timely policy

communication via monetary policy press releases

was continued and the publishing of the inflation fan

chart was re-commenced during the year, amidst

several risks and uncertainties on the inflation

outlook. These monetary policy announcements

were complemented by press conferences that were

livestreamed to a wider audience via social media.

With a view to anchoring inflation expectations, the

Central Bank commenced publishing the inflation

fan chart in monthly press releases on inflation

developments as well. In addition, the Governor

and senior officials of the Central Bank participated

in various interviews, conferences, seminars, invited

lectures and webinars, attempting to increase

the reach of policy communication and correct

misconceptions of policy perspectives. Regular

publications of the Central Bank, including the Annual

Report and Recent Economic Developments, were

completed timely in all three languages, while the

Central Bank assisted the Government to undertake

necessary fiscal policy measures by submitting the

September 15th Report and several submissions of

reports under sections 64 and 68 of the Monetary

Law Act. Going forward, the Central Bank will be

taking steps to align its publications as per the new

Central Bank Act, which is expected to be enacted

in the period ahead, where the publication of a

bi-annual Monetary Policy Report will commence.

7.3 Developments in Inflation

Headline inflation accelerated significantly

during the nine months ending September 2022,

reaching a historically high level, before trending

downward. The unprecedented acceleration of

headline inflation was mainly due to the notable rise

in food prices and other supply side disruptions, the

sharp depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee against

the US dollar and the subsequent adjustments

in administered prices, such as energy and

transport prices and their spillovers, and unabating

aggregate demand pressures owing to the lagged

impact of monetary accommodation during the

past few years. As measured by the year-on-year

change in the Colombo Consumer Price Index

(CCPI, 2013=100), the transport sector recorded over

100 per cent inflation during the months of the

second half of 2022 and peaked at 150.4 per cent in

September 2022, while food inflation also peaked at

94.9 per cent in the same month. However, the easing

of demand pressures owing to the lagged effects of

monetary policy tightening as well as the softening of

food and energy inflation caused headline inflation to

decelerate from the latter part of 2022. Accordingly,

headline inflation, as measured by the year-on-year

change in the CCPI (2013=100) accelerated to

69.8 per cent in September 2022, from 12.1 per cent

at end 2021, before moderating to 57.2 per cent

by end 2022. Annual average inflation, based on

the CCPI (2013=100), soared to 46.4 per cent

in 2022, from 6.0 per cent in 2021. Year-on-year

headline inflation, based on the National

Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100), followed

a similar trend and peaked at 73.7 per cent

in September 2022, compared to 14.0 per cent at

end 2021, before moderating to 59.2 per cent by

end 2022. Annual average inflation, based on the

NCPI (2013=100), was recorded at 50.4 per cent

in 2022, compared to 7.0 per cent in 2021. The

deceleration of inflation that started in October 2022

continued through early 2023. The Department of

Census and Statistics (DCS) revised the base year

for both CCPI and NCPI from 2013 to 2021, in order

to accommodate the changing expenditure patterns

and incorporate changes in goods and services

available in the market. However, the deceleration

trend of inflation remained broadly unaffected under

both series despite this revision of the base year.

Accordingly, year-on-year headline inflation, based on

the CCPI (2021=100), decelerated to 50.6 per cent

in February 2023, while that of NCPI (2021=100) was

recorded at 53.6 per cent in February 2023.

Reflecting the underlying demand driven

pressures, core inflation also accelerated

during the nine months ending September

2022, before moderating thereafter, albeit at

a slower pace, compared to that of headline

inflation. The rise of core inflation could be mainly

attributed to the pent-up demand stemming from

the lagged impact of monetary accommodation

in the past, and price hikes in imported goods,

coupled with the increase in costs of non-food

categories, such as restaurants and hotels, health

and education. Both CCPI and NCPI based

year-on-year core inflation peaked in September

2022, and moderated thereafter. The pace of

deceleration of core inflation was slower than

that of headline inflation as a large portion of

inflation deceleration was attributed to volatile

food and energy components, which are excluded

from the measurement of core inflation. The

contraction of demand resulting from the monetary

policy tightening was the main contributor for

this deceleration of core inflation. Year-on-year

core inflation, based on the CCPI (2013=100),

accelerated from 8.3 per cent at end 2021 to

50.2 per cent in September 2022, before moderating

to 47.7 per cent by end 2022. Annual average core

inflation, based on the CCPI (2013=100), was

recorded at 34.6 per cent in 2022, compared to

4.4 per cent in 2021. Core inflation (year-on-year),

based on the NCPI (2013=100), also accelerated

February 2023, while year-on-year core inflation,

based on the NCPI (2021=100), decelerated to

50.1 per cent in February 2023.

Inflation expectations broadly followed the

trend of realised inflation, despite remaining

elevated. The behaviour of near term inflation

expectations of both the corporate and household

sectors, which was mostly of an adaptive nature,

remained broadly similar in 2022. A downward shift

in expectations across all tenures was observed

in recent months in line with the deceleration in

actual inflation. As per the survey responses, the

expected moderation of inflation in the period ahead

would be mainly due to anticipated improvements

in domestic supply conditions, relaxation of import

restrictions, expected easing of global commodity

prices, decrease in income levels, and tight

monetary conditions.

7.4 Movements of Interest Rates

Market Liquidity and Short-Term Interest Rates

Liquidity in the domestic money market

remained at high deficit levels during the first

half of 2022, before improving gradually towards

the end of the year. Liquidity in the domestic money

market, which declined to negative levels following

the upward adjustment in the Statutory Reserve

Ratio (SRR) in September 2021, was allowed to

remain at negative levels reflecting the need for

maintaining tight monetary conditions amidst high

inflation rates. Among the other major factors that

contributed to such large negative liquidity in the

money market include net foreign exchange sales

by the Central Bank in facilitating the importation

of essential goods, net foreign loan repayments

of the Government by drawing down gross official

reserves, net currency withdrawals by the public

from the banking system, and maturities of foreign

currency buy-sell swaps with domestic banks. The

factors that contributed to the gradual improvement

in domestic money market liquidity from May

2022 include the impact of the primary purchases

of government securities by the Central Bank, an

increase in currency deposits to the banking system

with high deposit interest rates, and the long term

reverse repo auctions conducted from time to

time to address significant liquidity constraints

of certain banks. Accordingly, the daily average

liquidity in the domestic money market recorded

a deficit of around Rs. 279 billion during the last

quarter of 2022, compared to a large daily average

deficit of around Rs. 531 billion during the first half

of 2022. Nevertheless, the distribution of money

market liquidity demonstrated large asymmetries,

where certain domestic banks, particularly

state-owned commercial banks, recorded significant

liquidity deficits reflecting their transactions with

the Government and SOBEs, while foreign banks

maintained large liquidity surpluses, reflecting

prudential risk management concerns on

Government exposure. As a result, several LCBs

continued to rely on the standing facilities of the

Central Bank without transacting in the interbank

market. With the view to addressing the underlying

overnight liquidity considerations of LCBs, the

Central Bank decided to impose restrictions

on the usage of standing facilities effective

mid-January 2023.1 Following this regulatory

measure and the simultaneous conduct of long term

reverse repo auctions and other liquidity providing

facilities by the Central Bank, a notable improvement

in overnight domestic money market liquidity was

observed, where it turned to a surplus level in

mid-January 2023 after 16 months. Subsequently,

overnight liquidity in the domestic money market

remained volatile, mainly reflecting the impact of the

usage pattern of the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF)

by banks with excess liquidity. Meanwhile, rupee

liquidity in the domestic money market improved

notably, primarily due to the moderation of forex sales

by the Central Bank following the improvements

in the liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange

1 With effect from 16 January 2023, the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) (overnight deposit facility that allows LCBs to park excess liquidity and earn interest) was limited to a maximum of five (05) times per calendar month. At the same time, the Standing Lending Facility (SLF), which is the collateralised facility provided for LCBs to fulfill any further shortage of the liquidity requirements from the Central Bank at the end of the day, was also limited to 90 per cent of SRR of each LCB on any given day.

market, and net forex purchases by the Central

Bank, particularly in 2023 thus far. Accordingly, the

average overnight liquidity deficit declined to around

Rs. 72 billion during the first quarter of 2023.

In response to the tight liquidity conditions

and the continuation of tight monetary policy,

the Average Weighted Call Money Rate

(AWCMR) remained around the upper bound

of the Standing Rate Corridor (SRC). AWCMR,

which hovered near the upper bound of SRC at the

beginning of 2022, touched the upper bound of SRC

mainly due to the continued large liquidity deficit

of the banking system. Activity in the interbank

money market saw a gradual reduction from April

2022 onwards, with the market remaining inactive

for the most part following the policy interest

rate adjustment in July 2022. The lacklustre

activity in the interbank market was mainly due

to the market uncertainty emanating from the

domestic debt restructuring concerns amidst the

asymmetric liquidity distribution and prudential risk

management concerns, such as counterparty limits

by foreign banks. However, with the measures

taken by the Central Bank, such as the regular

conduct of long-term reverse repo auctions and

subsequent imposition of restrictions on the use of

standing facilities, a gradual resumption of activity

was observed in the interbank money markets.

Consequently, AWCMR recorded a marginal

reduction from the upper bound of SRC mid-

January 2023 onwards. Accordingly, AWCMR rose

by 9.55 percentage points during 2022 in response

to the cumulative adjustment of 9.50 percentage

points in the policy interest rates during 2022.

Meanwhile, with the increase in policy interest

rates by 100 basis points in March 2023, AWCMR

increased to 16.46 per cent as of 07 March 2023

and remained around the upper bound of SRC by

end March 2023.

Yields on Government Securities

The yields on government securities

increased notably during 2022, reflecting

the increased risk premia amidst concerns

about domestic debt restructuring and

significantly high borrowing requirements of

the Government, along with the increase in

policy interest rates by the Central Bank in

view of containing burgeoning price pressures.

Yields on government securities increased notably

during 2022 as market sentiments were dampened

by the Government’s continued reliance on

domestic market sources with limited access to

foreign financing and heightened concerns about

domestic debt restructuring. A notable disparity

was observed between the policy interest rates

and yields on government securities, while other

market interest rates continued to edge up in line

with the movements of the latter. The yields on

Treasury bills in the primary market rose notably

by around 22.30-25.00 percentage points across

all tenures during the year up to their peak levels,

as opposed to a 9.50 percentage points increase in

policy interest rates during 2022. Towards the end

of 2022 and early 2023, a notable moderation was

observed in the yields on government securities as

investor sentiment improved in anticipation of the

finalisation of the IMF-EFF arrangement. Improved

liquidity conditions in the domestic money market

due to the measures taken by the Central Bank,

including the restrictions on standing facilities and

injection of liquidity through long term reverse repo

auctions and other liquidity providing facilities by

the Central Bank, supported the reduction in yields

on government securities. Accordingly, the yields

on Treasury bills in the primary market for 364-day

maturity peaked in early September 2022, and the

same for 91-day and 182-day maturities peaked in

mid-November 2022. As such, yields on Treasury

bills dropped by around 2.80-3.90 percentage

points across all tenures by end-February

2023 from their peak levels. Market appetite for

Treasury bills remained broadly intact, although

increased appetite towards the shortest maturity

was observed due to domestic debt restructuring

concerns. However, a gradual improvement in

late 1991. The Average Weighted Fixed Deposit

Rate (AWFDR)3 also followed a similar trend.

Further, the Average Weighted New Deposit Rate

(AWNDR)4 and the Average Weighted New Fixed

Deposit Rate (AWNFDR)5 rose to their highest

levels on record, peaking at 23.63 per cent

and 24.05 per cent, respectively, in November

2022. Accordingly, interest rates offered for new

deposits, as measured by AWNDR and AWNFDR,

increased by around 17 percentage points during

January-November 2022, disproportionate to the

increase in policy interest rates by 9.50 percentage

points during 2022. Having noted the excessive

upward adjustment in market deposit interest rates

in 2022, and the resulting impact on market lending

rates, the Central Bank stressed the need for

licensed banks to eliminate unhealthy competition

in mobilising deposits, while taking measures to

improve liquidity in the domestic money market,

particularly in the latter part of 2022. Reflecting

the impact of improved liquidity conditions towards

the end of 2022, market deposit interest rates

commenced moderating. Further, the measures

adopted by the Central Bank to activate the

interbank market in early 2023 helped improve

liquidity in the domestic money market. With

the appetite for all tenures was observed towards

late 2022 and early 2023 due to improved market

sentiments. Meanwhile, yields on Treasury

bonds followed the trend observed in Treasury

bills where the primary market yields increased

significantly during the period from January to

mid-November 2022, while a moderation was

observed thereafter. Unlike Treasury bills, the

market appetite was more towards the longer term

Treasury bonds with a high yield. Secondary market

yields on government securities also recorded

substantial increases in line with the primary

market yields but eased thereafter following the

trend observed in the primary market.

Deposit and Lending Interest Rates

Deposit interest rates offered by LCBs

increased significantly in 2022 reflecting the

passthrough of monetary policy tightening

measures taken by the Central Bank and

the tight liquidity conditions in the domestic

money market. The substantial increase in policy

interest rates by the Central Bank, the surge

in the yields on government securities driven

by increased risk premia, and the large and

persistent liquidity deficit in the domestic money

market that heightened competition among

licensed banks to retain existing deposits and

promote new deposits caused deposit interest

rates to adjust upward sharply. Amidst significant

liquidity tightness in the domestic money market,

banks offered novel deposit products with high

rates of interest, particularly for short term

tenures. Moreover, the large increase in the

yields on government securities caused upward

pressures on deposit interest rates. Given these

developments, the Average Weighted Deposit

Rate (AWDR)2 reached 14.06 per cent by end

December 2022, recording the highest level since

this and the notable moderation in the yields on

government securities, particularly from January

2023, the declining trend in deposit interest rates

is expected to continue in the period ahead.

Market lending interest rates also increased

notably during 2022 in response to the tight

monetary and liquidity conditions, while certain

lending interest rates began to moderate

towards end 2022. The unprecedented increase

in the Central Bank’s policy interest rates, the

substantial liquidity deficit in the domestic money

market that drove up deposit interest rates,

the pricing in of elevated credit risk amidst the

contraction of economic activity, and the elevated

yields on government securities, mainly caused the

rise in market lending interest rates in 2022. Certain

market lending interest rates reached the highest

levels on record in 2022. The Average Weighted

Lending Rate (AWLR)6 increased by around

9 percentage points to 18.70 per cent by end 2022,

by around 17 percentage points, compared to end

2021. Meanwhile, the monthly Average Weighted

Prime Lending Rate (AWPR),8 the lending interest

rate for prime customers, closely followed the

yields on government securities and peaked at

28.25 per cent in November 2022, surpassing

other lending interest rates. In view of the tight

monetary conditions, the maximum interest rates

imposed on credit card advances, pre-arranged

temporary overdrafts, and pawning advances

were revoked in April 2022, allowing interest rates

applicable to these lending products to increase

in line with other market lending interest rates.

Average interest rates on loans to Small and

Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs), as measured

in the SME Credit Survey,9 broadly followed the

trend of overall average lending interest rates of

LCBs, with an added risk premium. Accordingly,

the Average Weighted SME Lending Rate

(AWSR)10 and the Average Weighted New SME

Lending Rate (AWNSR)11 increased by around

10 and 17 percentage points, respectively, during

2022. However, along with the improvements in

market liquidity and a notable downward shift

in the yields on government securities towards

the end of 2022, some market lending interest

rates showed signs of moderation by end 2022.

In particular, the monthly AWPR dropped by

348 basis points during January-February 2023.

Downward movements in other market lending

interest rates are also expected in the period

ahead.

8 AWPR is based on interest rates applicable to short term rupee loans and advances granted by LCBs to their prime customers during a particular week.

The Legal Rate and the Market Rate

of Interest,12 which are published in the

Government Gazette at the end of each year,

were determined at 16.97 per cent per annum

for 2023 by the Monetary Board, compared to

7.48 per cent per annum for 2022. The Legal

Rate and the Market Rate for 2023 were computed

based on the simple averages of monthly AWLR

of LCBs, which prevailed during the six months

prior to December (i.e., for the period from June

to November 2022), with a view to reflecting the

prevailing market interest rates.13

Interest Rates on Foreign Currency Deposits

Interest rates on foreign currency deposits

recorded a sharp upward adjustment in 2022

reflecting the tightening of global financial

conditions, elevated country risk premium as

well as increased competition among licensed

banks to mobilise foreign currency deposits

amidst significant liquidity shortages in the

domestic foreign exchange market. Central

banks in most advanced economies pursued tight

monetary policies in order to fight rising global

inflation and to avoid de-anchoring of inflation

expectations, resulting in an increased tightness in

financial conditions in most parts of the world. The

US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank,

and the Bank of England increased their policy

interest rates substantially during 2022. Meanwhile,

licensed banks offered attractive interest rates to

mobilise foreign currency deposits, in response

12 The Legal Rate is defined under the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 6 of 1990 and is applicable to any action for the recovery of a sum of money. The Market Rate is defined under the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No. 2 of 1990, and applies only in relation to actions instituted by lending institutions for the recovery of debt exceeding Rs. 150,000 arising out of commercial transactions, where there is no agreed rate of interest.

13 In 2022, the calculation method of the Legal Rate and Market Rate was revised considering the prevailed high interest rate structure. Accordingly, the rates for 2023 were calculated based on simple averages of monthly AWLR, that prevailed during the six months ending November 2022.

to the acute shortage of foreign currency

liquidity among the banks, amidst significant

BOP pressures. With the continued increase

in market interest rates on rupee denominated

deposit products following the implementation

of tight monetary policy from August 2021, the

cap imposed on foreign currency deposit interest

rates offered by LCBs and the National Savings

Bank was removed in March 2022. This allowed a

significant upward adjustment in interest rates on

foreign currency deposits of licensed banks in line

with both global and domestic market conditions.

Accordingly, interest rates offered for US dollar and

pound sterling denominated domestic savings and

time deposits, among others, increased by end

2022, compared to end 2021.

7.5 Movements in Money and

Credit Aggregates

Reserve Money

Reserve money, which is the monetary base

of the economy, recorded a moderate growth

during 2022, particularly in the latter part of

the year, with subdued growth in currency in

circulation as well as deposits of LCBs with the

Central Bank, compared to 2021. Currency in

circulation remained at elevated levels during the first

half of 2022 as transaction demand for currency by

the public rose on account of the increased spending

requirements owing to rising inflation and increased

preference to holding physical currency for contingent

purposes amidst supply shortages of selected

essential commodities. However, following significant

monetary tightening during the year, currency in

circulation started to gradually decline towards the

end of 2022, reflecting the high opportunity cost of

holding currency amidst increasing market interest

rates. Accordingly, currency in circulation increased

moderately by Rs. 21.5 billion during the year to

Rs. 1,026.6 billion by end 2022, over the expansions

of Rs. 170.3 billion recorded in 2021 and Rs. 156.8

billion during 2020 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

Meanwhile, the deposits of LCBs maintained at

the Central Bank recorded a marginal increase

during the year with SRR remaining unchanged

during 2022. By end 2022, deposits of LCBs with

the Central Bank increased by Rs. 22.1 billion to

Rs. 322.8 billion, compared to the notable expansion of

Rs. 171.1 billion recorded in 2021. Accordingly,

reserve money grew by 3.3 per cent, year-on-year,

to Rs. 1,349.4 billion by end 2022, compared to the

growth of 35.4 per cent, year-on-year, in 2021. In

absolute terms, reserve money increased by Rs. 43.6

billion during 2022, compared to the notable increase

of Rs. 341.4 billion in 2021. Meanwhile, high volatility

was observed in reserve money balances on a daily

basis from the beginning of 2023, reflecting the impact

of administrative measures taken by the Central Bank

to reduce the overdependence of LCBs on standing

facilities of the Central Bank, with restrictions limiting

access to SDF and SLF. Accordingly, the limited

access to SDF resulted in LCBs maintaining excess

reserves with the Central Bank at irregular intervals,

creating volatility in daily reserve money balances.

Viewed from the assets side of the Central

Bank’s balance sheet, the expansion of reserve

money was entirely due to the increase in Net

Domestic Assets (NDA), while Net Foreign

Assets (NFA) declined notably during 2022.

The expansion in NDA of the Central Bank

was mainly driven by NCG, which increased by

Rs. 1,338.4 billion to Rs. 3,432.5 billion by end 2022,

compared to the increase of Rs. 1,225.2 billion in

2021. This reflects a considerable increase in the

Central Bank’s holdings of government securities

(net of repurchase transactions) during 2022. This

increase in the holdings of government securities by

the Central Bank reflects the continued purchases of

Treasury bills from the primary market and the direct

allocation of Treasury bills to the Central Bank as the

Government continued to rely on monetary financing

amidst subdued government revenue, limited access

to foreign financing due to the debt standstill, and

diminished market appetite for government securities

amidst domestic debt restructuring concerns.

Accordingly, the holdings of government securities

by the Central Bank (net of repurchase transactions)

increased by Rs. 1,251.7 billion to Rs. 3,197.1 billion

by end 2022. Meanwhile, the balances transferred

to the Government as provisional advances also

increased during the year, contributing to the increase

in NCG by the Central Bank. However, the decline

in the Central Bank’s claims on LCBs resulting from

foreign exchange losses associated with foreign

currency swaps, and the repayment of concessionary

loans that were extended by the Central Bank

through LCBs to support businesses and individuals

during the pandemic, suppressed the increase in

NDA of the Central Bank. Accordingly, NDA of the

Central Bank increased by Rs. 1,270.2 billion during

2022, compared to the increase of Rs. 1,255.4 billion

during 2021. Meanwhile, NFA of the Central Bank

contracted notably by Rs. 1,226.6 billion during 2022

following the contraction of Rs. 914.0 billion during

the previous year, which caused NFA to turn negative

from August 2021. During 2022, the foreign assets of

the Central Bank declined mainly due to the utilisation

of a large part of the foreign assets of the Central

Bank to provide liquidity to the domestic foreign

exchange market to facilitate essential imports and

meet the external debt obligations of the Government,

particularly during early 2022. As the outstanding

foreign liabilities outweighed the foreign assets of the

Central Bank, the sharp depreciation of the Sri Lanka

rupee against the US dollar led to a larger increase in

foreign liabilities over the increase in foreign assets,

further deteriorating NFA of the Central Bank in 2022.

The extension of the settlement periods applicable for

international swaps entered into by the Central Bank

and the deferment of the outstanding amount payable

to Asian Clearing Union (ACU) also contributed to an

expansion of foreign liabilities of the Central Bank.

Meanwhile, an accumulation of Central Bank foreign

assets was also observed toward the end of 2022

due to the increased purchase of foreign exchange

by the Central Bank from licensed banks under the

requirement to sell residuals of the repatriated export

proceeds and workers’ remittances, which were

subjected to mandatory conversions.

The money multiplier, which is the ratio

between broad money supply (M2b) and reserve

money, increased in 2022 as a result of the

significant expansion of broad money supply

(M2b), while the expansion of reserve money

remained moderate. Accordingly, the money

multiplier based on broad money (M2b) increased

to 9.11 by end 2022 from 8.15 recorded at end

2021, due to the expansion of M2b reflecting

increased public sector borrowings and the

valuation impact that arose from the rupee

depreciation, amidst a tepid expansion of reserve

money during the year. Meanwhile, the currency

to deposits ratio decreased to 6.4 per cent by end

2022 from 8.0 per cent recorded at end 2021, due

to the combined effect of decreasing currency held

by the public and a notable increase in time and

savings deposits held by the public during 2022

compared to the preceding year.

Broad Money (M2b) and Domestic Credit

Despite the substantial expansion of credit

to the public sector and the augmentation

of domestic credit of the banking system in

rupee terms following the depreciation of the

exchange rate (i.e., the revaluation effect),

the growth of broad money supply (M2b)

decelerated in 2022 driven by the significant

contraction of credit to the private sector. The

year-on-year growth of M2b, which decelerated

gradually since early 2021 supported by the tight

monetary conditions, accelerated notably in early

2022 to peak at 20.0 per cent by end April 2022

mainly due to the revaluation effect of foreign

currency denominated domestic credit amidst the

steep depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee against

the US dollar. However, despite the substantial

expansion of credit to the public sector, particularly

NCG by the banking system, a decelerating trend

was observed in the growth of M2b from May 2022

mainly driven by the contraction of credit to the

private sector owing to the substantial tightening of

monetary conditions. As a result, the year-on-year

growth of M2b moderated to 15.4 per cent by

end 2022. Once adjusted for the depreciation of

the Sri Lanka rupee against the US dollar,14 the

year-on-year growth of M2b is estimated to have

decelerated to around 7 per cent by end 2022.

On the liabilities side of M2b, the increase in

time and savings deposits held by the public

with LCBs largely contributed to the monetary

expansion during 2022. Compared to the

contribution of 77 per cent recorded in 2021, the

increase in time and savings deposits contributed

largely to the year-on-year expansion of M2b in 2022.

A marginal expansion of demand deposits held by

the public with LCBs was also recorded during 2022,

while currency held by the public contracted during

the year owing to the high opportunity cost of holding

currency amidst high market interest rates. Reflecting

the impact of high deposit interest rates offered by

LCBs amidst tight liquidity conditions, time and

savings deposits of LCBs increased significantly by

Rs. 1,648.6 billion in 2022, recording a growth of 17.9

per cent, year-on-year, compared to the increase of

Rs. 958.8 billion recorded in 2021. Meanwhile, the

year-on-year growth of demand deposits decelerated

to 5.3 per cent by end 2022 amidst high interest

rates and subpar economic activity, compared to the

growth of 26.0 per cent at end 2021. Currency held by

the public contracted by 5.4 per cent, year-on-year,

by end 2022, compared to the notable growth of 22.4

per cent, year-on-year, by end 2021.

On the assets side of M2b, continuing the

trend observed in 2021, NFA of the banking

system contracted significantly during 2022

driven by the decline in NFA of the Central Bank,

while NFA of LCBs recorded an improvement

during the second half of the year. NFA of the

Central Bank continued to contract notably by

Rs. 1,226.6 billion during 2022 following the

contraction of Rs. 914.0 billion in the previous

year, as foreign currency liabilities increased

notably outweighing the increase in foreign

currency assets along with the impact of exchange

rate depreciation. Foreign currency liabilities of

the Central Bank increased owing to the increase

in foreign currency payables to international

counterparts following the extension of the

settlement of the international swaps entered by

the Central Bank with regional peers and the large

accumulation of payables to ACU. Although foreign

currency assets of the Central Bank increased

due to the purchase of foreign exchange from

LCBs under the mandatory sales requirement of

repatriation of export proceeds and converted

worker’s remittances, these assets were utilised

to provide foreign exchange to facilitate essential

imports amidst significant BOP pressures, and

to meet the Government’s foreign currency debt

service obligations, particularly during early 2022.

Nevertheless, with the gradual improvement of

forex liquidity in the market, forex purchases by

the Central Bank in building up the gross official

reserves helped improve NFA of the Central Bank.

Meanwhile, NFA of LCBs improved by Rs. 441.8

billion during 2022 over the increase of Rs. 141.5

billion recorded in 2021 with the expansion in NFA

of offshore banking units (OBUs), while NFA of

domestic banking units (DBUs) contracted during

the year. NFA of OBUs increased notably in 2022

mainly due to the increase in placements with

banks abroad and lending to non-residents along

with the contraction in foreign liabilities, particularly

due to the settlement of short term liabilities. In

contrast, NFA of DBUs contracted during 2022

mainly on account of the increase in foreign

currency liabilities in terms of deposit liabilities of

non-residents outweighing the increase in foreign

currency placements with banks abroad.

NCG by the banking system increased

significantly during 2022, leading to an

expansion in NDA. Continuing the same trend

observed in 2021, the Government’s increased

funding requirement in 2022 was largely met

through the domestic banking system, mainly

the Central Bank, due to lower-than-expected

revenue mobilisation of the Government and

limited access to foreign financing. The sharp

increase in NCG by the banking system signifies

the crowding out of private sector investments

during the period under review. During 2022, NCG

by the banking system increased significantly by

Rs. 1,638.7 billion, compared to the expansion of

Rs. 1,284.4 billion in 2021. NCG by the Central

Bank increased by Rs. 1,338.4 billion during 2022,

contributing to over 80 per cent of the overall

expansion in NCG. The Central Bank provided

finances to the Government in terms of Treasury

bill purchases from the primary market subscribing

to under-allocations of auctions, in addition to

the direct allocations of Treasury bills to the

Central Bank in meeting cashflow shortfalls, as

well as provisional advances. NCG of LCBs also

increased by around Rs. 300 billion during 2022,

driven by investments in Treasury bills, Treasury

bonds as well as in Sri Lanka Development Bonds

(SLDBs). The Government has reduced the

overdraft balances with LCBs significantly during

the year.

Credit obtained by SOBEs from the banking

system expanded in 2022, mainly on account of

the revaluation effect of their foreign currency

denominated borrowings, while the weak financial

performance of SOBEs necessitated continuous

borrowings from LCBs. Compared to the expansion

of Rs. 185.9 billion in 2021, credit obtained by SOBEs

from the banking system increased notably by

Rs. 558.9 billion during 2022, of which over 70

per cent was on account of the revaluation effect

of foreign currency denominated debt that arose

as a result of the substantial currency depreciation.

Reflecting the increased financial need to facilitate

fuel importation, credit obtained by the Ceylon

Petroleum Corporation (CPC) increased by Rs. 477.3

billion during 2022 largely contributing to the overall

expansion of credit obtained by the SOBEs. Moreover,

credit obtained by SriLankan Airlines rose by

Rs. 36.5 billion, while that of the Ceylon Electricity

Board (CEB) increased by Rs. 31.9 billion during the

year. In addition, credit obtained by the Ceylon Shipping

Corporation, National Water Supply & Drainage

Board (NWS&DB), Urban Development Authority

(UDA) and Road Development Authority (RDA) also

increased considerably during 2022. Meanwhile,

Colombo Commercial Fertilizer (CCF), Paddy

Marketing Board (PMB) and State Pharmaceuticals

Corporation (SPC) made net repayments to LCBs in

2022. Accordingly, outstanding credit to SOBEs rose

to Rs. 1,747.0 billion by end 2022.15

In response to the tight monetary conditions

and the moderation in economic activity,

outstanding credit extended to the private sector

by LCBs continued to contract from mid-2022.

Outstanding credit to the private sector by LCBs

increased notably during early 2022 mainly on

account of the revaluation effect of foreign currency

denominated debt amidst the substantial currency

depreciation and organic growth of credit. However,

with the sharp upward adjustment in market lending

interest rates from April 2022 reflecting the significant

tightening of monetary policy and the dearth of liquidity

in the banking system, credit to the private sector

started contracting notably on a month-on-month

basis from June 2022. In particular, the cumulative

contraction of credit to the private sector by LCBs

during June-December 2022 amounted to Rs. 340.7

billion. Consequently, the annual expansion of credit

to the private sector by LCBs was limited to Rs. 432.7

billion during 2022, compared to the expansion of

Rs. 810.5 billion recorded in 2021. Accordingly, the

year-on-year growth of credit to the private sector

decelerated to 6.2 per cent by end 2022 from 13.1

per cent recorded at end 2021. Excluding the valuation

impact arising from the exchange rate depreciation,16

credit extended to the private sector is estimated to

have contracted by Rs. 231.1 billion in 2022 over the

previous year, recording a contraction of 3.3 per cent,

year-on-year, by end 2022.

As per the Quarterly Survey of Commercial

Banks’ Loans and Advances to the Private

Sector, year-on-year growth of credit to all major

economic sectors moderated notably during

2022, particularly in the second half of the year,

reflecting the impact of tight monetary conditions,

subdued economic activity, and significant fiscal

reforms, among others. During the first half of 2022,

the year-on-year growth of outstanding credit by LCBs

to all major economic sectors increased primarily on

account of the revaluation effect of foreign currency

denominated credit. This increase was more prominent

in the Industry and Services sectors as they accounted

for a larger volume of foreign currency denominated

credit. However, this trend reversed in the second

half of 2022, with subdued economic activity along

with supply shortages, the sharp upward adjustment

in market lending interest rates amidst tight monetary

conditions and significant fiscal reforms resulting in a

deceleration of credit to all major economic sectors by

end 2022. In terms of sectoral credit, the year-on-year

growth of credit to the Industry sector decelerated to

8.4 per cent by end 2022 from 12.6 per cent at end

2021. Within the Industry sector, reflecting subdued

construction related activities during the year

amidst the shortage of building materials and high

input costs along with the decline in demand under

high interest rates, growth of credit to the Construction

subsector decelerated notably to 3.1 per cent,

year-on-year, by end 2022 from 13.1 per cent at

end 2021. The year-on-year growth of credit to the

Textiles and Apparel subsector also decelerated

notably to 7.6 per cent by end 2022 from 16.1 per

cent at end 2021, owing to subdued global demand

conditions and supply side disruptions. The growth

of credit extended to the Services sector also

decelerated notably to 4.2 per cent, year-on-year, by

end 2022 from 16.3 per cent at end 2021. Within the

Services sector, reflecting subdued activity related to

trade, transport and communication along with rising

input costs, credit to the Wholesale and Retail Trade,

Transport, and Communication and Information

Technology subsectors contracted by 1.1 per cent,

27.1 per cent and 21.8 per cent, respectively, on a

year-on-year basis, by end 2022. Moderation in the

Services sector credit was also supported by a lower

level of lending to Financial and Business Services

amidst rising interest rates. Nevertheless, reflecting

the gradual improvement in tourism related activities

along with the extended debt moratoria and other

concessionary measures, credit to the Tourism

subsector expanded, recording a year-on-year growth

of 29.4 per cent by end 2022. With respect to credit to

the Agriculture and Fishing sector, the year-on-year

growth of credit decelerated to 9.1 per cent by end

2022, compared to the growth of 12.7 per cent by end

2021. Within this sector, credit flows to the Coconut

and Paddy subsectors contracted during 2022, while

some improvement in credit flows to the Tea and

Rubber subsectors was witnessed during the year.

Reflecting increased consumption related credit, the

year-on-year growth of credit extended in the form

of Personal Loans and Advances accelerated to

11.8 per cent by end 2022, compared to the growth

of 10.3 per cent at end 2021. Reflecting the difficulties

faced by the public amidst the increased cost of

living, Pawning related advances expanded by

around Rs. 121.0 billion, recording a notable growth of

40.0 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2022, compared

to the growth of 21.6 per cent recorded in 2021. Credit

granted under Consumer Durables contracted by

1.7 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2022, compared

to a growth of 13.3 per cent at end 2021. The

growth of Credit Card advances also decelerated to

3.2 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2022, compared

to a growth of 13.3 per cent at end 2021. Meanwhile,

the maturity-wise analysis of outstanding credit

to the private sector by LCBs reflects increased

market appetite towards short term loans over other

tenures amidst the high interest rate environment,

although a slowdown in the year-on-year expansion

of credit was observed across all tenures by end

2022 compared to end 2021.

Outstanding credit to the SME sector, as

reflected by the monthly SME Credit Survey,17

contracted during 2022 in line with the overall

moderation in credit to the private sector by

LCBs. On a year-on-year basis, credit to the SME

sector by both LCBs and Licensed Specialised

Banks (LSBs) contracted by 8.3 per cent by end

2022, compared to the growth of 21.7 per cent

at end 2021. The significant increase in interest

rates applicable on loans to the SME sector by

licensed banks amidst tight monetary conditions,

subdued aggregate demand conditions, limited

availability of raw materials for certain industries

and cost escalations, the cautious approach

adopted by licensed banks amidst elevated credit

risks with rising non-performing loans (NPLs),

and subdued business sentiments, among others,

contributed to the deterioration in credit extended

17 A monthly survey conducted by the Central Bank since July 2020 with the objective of identifying the average cost and the quantum of loans granted to SMEs by LCBs and LSBs.

to the SMEs. In terms of sectoral credit to the SME

sector, the outstanding amount of credit extended

to the Agriculture, Industry and Services sectors

contracted by 6.1 per cent, 6.5 per cent and 11.1

per cent, respectively, on a year-on-year basis, by

end 2022. With regard to the new loans granted to

the SME sector in 2022, a greater share of loans

extended was for short tenures, while a notable

decline was observed in the share of medium to

long term loans, compared to 2021. This indicates

that the new loan disbursements during the year

were more towards working capital purposes and

less towards investment purposes reflecting the

subdued economic activity, in comparison to the

previous year.

Broad Money (M4)

Growth of broad money supply (M4),

as measured by the Financial Survey,18

accelerated during 2022, following a

similar trend observed in broad money

supply (M2b). The year-on-year growth

of M4 accelerated to 14.3 per cent by end

2022 from 13.3 per cent recorded at end 2021.

Viewed from the assets side, the expansion of

M4 was driven entirely by the expansion in NDA.

Within NDA, domestic credit by LSBs increased

by Rs. 102.3 billion, while that of Licensed Finance

Companies (LFCs) rose by Rs. 106.8 billion

during 2022. The expansion of NCG based on M4

amounted to Rs. 1,699.3 billion during the year,

of which Rs. 37.0 billion was through LSBs and

Rs. 23.7 billion was through LFCs. Further,

reflecting mainly the impact of the significant

currency depreciation, credit extended to the

private sector by licensed banks and LFCs

increased notably till April 2022, followed by

a moderation thereafter underpinned by tight

monetary conditions. Accordingly, growth of credit

extended to the private sector by licensed banks

and LFCs grew by 6.2 per cent, year-on-year, by

end 2022, compared to 12.7 per cent, year-on-year,

at end 2021. Credit extended by LSBs to the

private sector increased by Rs. 65.4 billion

in 2022, recording a growth of 6.0 per cent,

year-on-year. Meanwhile, credit extended by

LFCs to the private sector rose by Rs. 83.1 billion

in 2022, recording a growth of 6.6 per cent,

year-on-year. However, the overall NFA, as per

M4, contracted by Rs. 768.2 billion during 2022,

reflecting the decline in NFA of the Central Bank,

while NFA of LSBs increased by Rs. 16.6 billion

during the year due to the settlement of foreign

liabilities.

Viewed from the liabilities side of M4,

the growth of time and savings deposits

held by the public with licensed banks and

LFCs increased during 2022. The overall growth

of time and savings deposits, as per M4,

accelerated due to the high interest rates offered

by licensed banks and LFCs, particularly during

the latter part of the year. Accordingly, the

year-on-year growth of time and savings

deposits, as per M4, accelerated to 16.0 per cent

by end 2022, compared to 11.6 per cent at

end 2021. Time and savings deposits

held with LFCs grew by 11.5 per cent,

in 2021. The moderate growth of time and savings

deposits held with LSBs could be attributed to

relatively high interest rates offered by LCBs

and LFCs in competing for deposits amidst tight

liquidity conditions.
