Accordingly, the Bank launched refinance and credit schemes through LCBs and LSBs under the names Saubagya COVID-19 Renaissance Facility Phase I, II, III and Liquidity Facility to the Construction Sector at concessionary interest rates with maturity terms ranging from 6 months to 2 years with the condition of lending by LCBs and LSBs to businesses affected by the pandemic.

This account was created under the guidance of the IMF by transferring the balance held in SCA-2 against Sri Lanka when it was decided to wind up SCA-2 by the IMF. The IMF requested the countries that had balances in the Post SCA-2 account to consider providing the balances in that account to the PRGF/HIPC Trust either as outright grant or as a means of providing a subsidy for PRGF/HIPC Loan. Accordingly GOSL agreed to transfer the funds from Post SCA\u20132 accounts to PRGF/HIPC Trust account, not as an outright grant, but as an interest free deposit until 2018. This was later extended until 2024.",

Risk Management Department, as a part of the second line of defence, is responsible for facilitating the risk management process related to financial and operational risks, by coordinating relevant activities to direct and guide CBSL in this regard. With regard to operational risks, RMD reports to the BROC, through the NFRMC and with regard to financial risks, RMD reports directly to the BROC, on a periodic basis. Internal Audit Department (IAD), as the third line of defence, is responsible for providing independent objective assurance and recommendations to add value and improving the control environment relating to operations of the CBSL through audits. IAD reports the progress of the conduct of audits to the MB and MBAAC, quarterly and submits information on audit reports issued to the Auditor General on quarterly basis.",

This portfolio is not an investment portfolio, as the Bank does not purchase Government Securities with the intention of earning an interest income. The Bank purchases or sells Government Securities to inject rupee liquidity into the domestic market or to absorb liquidity from the market in the course of carrying out its monetary policy operations in relation to one of its core objectives, maintaining economic and price stability. Hence, the volume of Government Securities in the Bank\u2019s portfolio is largely determined by its monetary policy operations. However, the portfolio may include Government Securities purchased under Section 112 of the Monetary Law Act. In addition, the basic interest rates in the rupee market, the Standing Deposit Rate and the Standing Lending Rate are policy rates determined by the Bank in the course of implementing its monetary policy. Moreover, the Bank's actions in injecting rupee liquidity or absorbing liquidity from the market have a significant impact on general rupee market interest rates. Thus, changes in the interest income earned from the Government Securities portfolio, which arise from changes in the volume of the Bank\u2019s Government Securities portfolio, as well as changes in interest rates, are primarily a consequence of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy actions or monetary financing, rather than due to investment decisions. Therefore, the Bank does not consider interest rate sensitivities arising from local currency assets",

CBSL has signed an agreement which enable CH to lend at their wish depending on the demand for those bonds. Since the lending does not involve CBSL and CH lends them directly to the borrowers, the process is called auto bond lending.

CMD was also instrumental in providing live coverage for its press conferences and other important events to the desktops of the staff to ensure they were well informed about the happenings at the Central Bank. An online Knowledge Sharing Platform was introduced in 2022 to break silos in the work environment and to share information pertaining to the policies and processes of respective departments among the staff, whereby 8 timely topics were discussed through the MS Teams platform. To ensure that all staff is well versed on developments in the local economy as well as the global financial markets, CMD shared all relevant online news among the staff via email, supplemented by the Library and Information Center (LIC) of CMD, which identifies all relevant newspaper articles, which are uploaded to the intranet platform. All critical news items are also brought to the attention of the Senior Management. Considering the increasing price of newsprint, LIC embarked on an electronic newspaper drive, to reduce costs. LIC also disseminated information by way of e-books, specific chapters of books, scholarly articles, etc. among the staff on a regular basis. In addition to that, LIC relaunched the book review competition for staff in October 2022, in celebration of National Reading Month, and 2 winners were selected.

In fulfilling its objective of sharing knowledge, the department conducted several awareness programmes to educate its stakeholders, including the general public, which provided an opportunity to explain the functioning of the economy and ongoing challenges in balancing policy tradeoffs. As the focal point of contact in maintaining international relations of the Central Bank in the capacity of the monetary authority of the country, ERD played a critical role in establishing and maintaining close cooperation with foreign counterparts, international agencies, and other stakeholders. Especially, ERD played the anchor role in facilitating negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) on matters relating to the Central Bank, prepared technical inputs for the meetings with the IMF, while responding to their technical level queries on numerous occasions. ERD provided inputs to facilitate the ongoing debt restructuring efforts of the Government, thereby closely coordinating with financial and legal advisors appointed for carrying out the debt restructuring process. Further, ERD coordinated several Missions from the IMF on EFF and technical assistance in multiple areas during 2022.",

The main objective of the EPMS is to ensure all exports of goods from the country are captured into a database and to monitor the repatriation of export proceeds as per the Rules on Repatriation of Export Proceeds into Sri Lanka. The EPMS captures export information through a web service provided by SLC and export proceeds repatriation details are submitted by ADs to the system.

However, subsequent to the Central Bank\u2019s decision to allow a measured adjustment in the exchange rate on 07 March 2022 due to the sharp depletion of gross official reserves of the country and the significant pressures in the domestic FX market, the USD/LKR exchange rate started to overshoot. As a measure in managing the intraday volatility of the exchange rate, amidst the challenging liquidity position and the absence of an active interbank FX market, the Central Bank commenced announcing exchange rate guidance with a variation margin since 13 May 2022. Consequently, the exchange rate stabilised gradually, and the weighted average spot exchange rate in the interbank FX market hovered between Rs. 360 - Rs. 363 per US dollar during the period from mid May to end December 2022. Since mid May 2022, IOD commenced publishing the USD/LKR middle spot exchange rate with a prescribed variation margin along with middle exchange rates for 56 other world currencies, on the Central Bank website, on a daily basis.
