The  Bank  considers 
that 
the  combined 
reporting  of 
foreign  and  local  currency  activities  would  weaken  the 
	
informational value of the financial statements.
5.3.1  Recognition and Initial Measurement 
All financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised 
at  cost,  being  the  fair  value  of  the  consideration  given 
	
•	
and  including  acquisition  charges  associated  with  the 
investment.  All 
regular  way  purchases  and 
sales  of 
financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the trade 
date  respectively.  Regular  way  purchases  or  sales  are 
	
•	
purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery 
of  assets  within  the  time  frame  generally  established  by 
regulation or convention in the market place.
5.3.2  Classification
Financial Assets
On initial recognition, Bank classifies the financial assets 
as measured at;
	
•	
Amortized	Cost
	
•	
Fair	Value	through	Other	Comprehensive	Income	
(FVOCI)
	
•	
Fair	Value	through	Profit	or	Loss	(FVTPL)
A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets 
both of the following conditions and is not designated as 
at FVTPL
	
•	
The	asset	is	held	within	a	business	model	whose	
objective  is  to  hold  assets  to  collect  contractual 
cash flows; and
	
•	
The	 contractual	 terms	 of	 the	 financial	 asset	 give	
rise on specified dates to cashflows that are Solely 
Payment of Principle and Interest.
A  financial  asset  is  measured  at  FVOCI  only  if  it  meets 
both of the following conditions and is not designated as 
at FVTPL.
	
•	
The	asset	is	held	within	a	business	model	whose	
objective is achieved by both collecting contractual 
cash flows and selling financial assets; and
	
•	
The	 contractual	 terms	 of	 the	 financial	 asset	 give	
rise on specified dates to cashflows that are Solely 
Payment of Principle and Interest.
On  initial  recognition  of  an  equity  investment  that  is 
not  held  for  trading,  the  Bank  may  irrevocably  elect  to 
present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. All other 
financial assets are classified as measured at FVTPL.","","","","managed  and  information  is  provided  to  management.","","",""

Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and 
whose  performance  is  evaluated  on  a  fair  value  basis 
are  measured  at  FVTPL  because  they  are  neither  held 
to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect 
contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.
Assessment of whether Contractual Cash Flows are 
Solely Payments of Principal and Interest
The Bank assesses the contractual terms of financial assets 
to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. For the purpose 
of this assessment, “Principal” is defined as the fair value 
of  the  financial  asset  at  initial  recognition  and  “Interest” 
is  defined  as  consideration  for  the  time  value  of  money 
and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount 
outstanding  during  a  particular  period  of  time  and  for 
other basic lending risks and costs.
The most significant elements of interest within a lending 
arrangement  are 
typically 
the 
consideration 
for 
the 
time  value  of  money  and  credit  risk.  To  make  the  SPPI 
assessment,  the  Bank  applies  judgement  and  considers 
relevant factors such as the currency in which the financial","","",""

rate is set.
In  contrast,  contractual 
terms 
that 
introduce  a  more 
than  the  minimum  exposure  to  risks  or  volatility  in  the 
contractual cash flows that are unrelated to a basic lending 
arrangement do not give rise to contractual cash flows that
