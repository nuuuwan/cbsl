lending  describes 
the  established  market 
practice  by  which,  for  a  fee,  securities  are  transferred 
temporarily  from  one  party  (the  lender,  i.e.  CBSL),  to 
another (the borrower); the borrower is obliged to return 
them either on demand or at the end of any agreed term. 
Currently a selected Clearing House (CH) functions as the 
custodian for the supranational bonds and bonds issued 
by different issuers. CBSL has signed an agreement which 
enable CH to lend at their wish depending on the demand 
for those bonds. Since the lending does not involve CBSL 
the  Bank  has  capital 
and CH lends them directly to the borrowers, the process 
is called auto bond lending. At the end of each month, 
custodian  will  send  fee  income  for  auto  bond  lending, 
if  any  for  the  bonds  which  they  lent  under  auto  bond 
lending  programme.  The  Bank  continues  to  recognize 
the securities in their entirety in the Statement of Financial
