Section  67  (1)  of  the  Monetary  Law  Act  which  specifies 
the composition of the International Reserve indicates that 
gold  may  be  held  by  the  CBSL  as  part  of  this  Reserve. 
According to Section 67(2), Monetary Board is required 
to  endeavor  to  hold  at  least  a  nuclear  reserve  in  gold 
or  currencies 
freely  convertible  by 
the  Central  Bank, 
whether directly or indirectly, in to gold as per the MLA. 
As this gold is part of the International Reserve and not 
used as a commodity which is traded during the normal 
course of business, gold is fair valued and the gains or 
losses are transferred to the Statement of Income. Prior to 
appropriation  of  profits,  the  unrealised  gains  from  gold 
are transferred to the relevant reserve account.
