    "text": "he Sri Lankan economy faced its most onerous year in its post-independence history in 2022, comprising severe economic hardship that led to both public anxiety and political upheaval. The impoverished conditions in the economy warranted immediate and coordinated policy initiatives by the Government and the Central Bank to preempt a further escalation of the situation. Although the corrective measures affected the vast citizenry in the near term, they were necessary to safeguard the economy and economic agents from potentially devastating consequences of unrestrained economic instability, such as hyperinflation, collapse of economic activity to a much deeper level, and a complete disconnect of the country from the rest of the world, with far worse consequences to the people and businesses. The outcomes of these efforts have eventuated since late 2022. The country managed to transition to a workable equilibrium in the near term, focused on restoring socio-economic stability, while the envisaged assistance from the international financial institutions begins to materialise.",

    "text": "Having run an unsustainable macroeconomic model in tandem with the longstanding deficits in the budget balance and the external current account, the economy had fully exhausted its buffers by early 2022 as it was straddled by a myriad of vulnerabilities that emanated from both global and domestic sources. Several inherent weaknesses of the economy, further exacerbated by policy lapses, steered the country towards a multifaceted disaster. Ill-timed tax reductions, an ill-equipped attempt to swiftly adopt organic agriculture, the depletion of the country\u2019s official reserves amidst futile attempts to maintain an untarnished debt servicing record, the delay in the exchange rate adjustment, and the failure to pay heed to several early warning signals caused tremendous shockwaves across the economy. Consequently, the economy was battered by excessive balance of payments (BOP) pressures with acute shortage of foreign exchange liquidity and pressured exchange rate, spiralling inflation and dampened economic activity amidst mass loss of livelihoods, large fiscal imbalances, public debt reaching unsustainable levels with extraordinarily high risk premia, devastating sovereign rating downgrades that constrained access to external finance, unprecedented heightening of socio-economic and socio-political tensions, and rapidly deteriorating business confidence, among others. Businesses and the general public alike were in severe distress amidst shortages and rationing of essentials, the ballooning cost of living and cost of production, and the loss of welfare and livelihoods. Consequently, the rapid unfolding of social unrest resulted in political instability, warranting an urgent need for redefining policy priorities to steer the economy away from further turmoil.",

    "text": "The Government initiated measures in early 2022 to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after months of indecisiveness. The IMF had already assessed that Sri Lanka\u2019s public debt had reached unsustainable levels, hence, any funding assistance from the IMF needed to be preceded by efforts to restructure public debt. Subsequently, when it reached a critical point of inability to service debt payments, the Government announced a debt standstill in mid-April 2022, thereby suspending the servicing of external debt, mainly bilateral and commercial debt, as an interim measure, while soliciting support from official and private creditors to restructure outstanding debt. Simultaneously, several initiatives were made by the Government to enhance government revenue, curtail expenditure, introduce reforms to major State Owned Enterprises (SOE), implement import controls, and ration energy supply, while exploring bridging finance from bilateral and multilateral partners for essential expenditures as well as supporting the most vulnerable segments. In September 2022, a staff level agreement was reached for an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) from the IMF, followed by efforts to secure financing assurances from official creditors towards the restructuring of debt, in line with the debt sustainability targets envisaged under the IMF-EFF supported programme. In March 2023, the Executive Board of the IMF approved the EFF supported programme of 48-months, amounting to approximately US dollars 3 billion, along with an economic adjustment programme that was aimed at putting Sri Lanka back on a recovery path, while addressing structural impediments that constrained the country\u2019s growth potential over the past decades. With a multitude of goals to be achieved under the IMF-EFF arrangement, restoring public debt sustainability through the debt restructuring process will be one of the key milestones in the path towards attaining a sustained growth in the economy. However, debt restructuring could pose near term challenges in the financial sector that need to be addressed proactively by the Government and Central Bank, thereby reinforcing the financial system stability in the period ahead.",

Further, the external current account deficit remained modest alongside the gradual accumulation of official reserves, thereby enabling the reinstatement of exchange rate flexibility from early March 2023. The envisaged normalisation of foreign exchange flows and the completion of the debt restructuring process during 2023, and the sweeping reforms in the public sector, are expected to pave way for the country\u2019s progress towards improved and sustainable economic prospects.",

    "text": "The socio-economic crisis in 2022 underlined many lessons that the country failed to grasp, despite the recurrence of such macroeconomic failures throughout its post-independence history. This economic episode reiterated the essentiality of data-driven policymaking; devastating implications of ad hoc policy experiments; crippling welfare impacts of myopic populist policies; and the cost of policy delays, disregarding evidence-based policy analysis, well-established economic fundamentals and expert opinions. The general public and businesses at large had to bear the cost of a one-time adjustment of delayed structural reforms. Against this backdrop, the Government, the Central Bank, and all other stakeholders need to extend their support towards the implementation of essential reforms at this juncture, to resolve the structural hindrances that have rooted in the economy over the last seven and a half decades. Failing to execute such reforms would lead to perpetual bailouts, endless cycles of external borrowing and recurring debt restructuring alongside unsustainable and highly volatile business cycles, which would cause undue pressure on citizenry, preventing the country from achieving longstanding economic progress and prosperity. Hence, in the country\u2019s efforts to emerge from the current crisis, consistent and well-coordinated policies, including those outlined in the IMF-EFF supported programme, should be executed in a timely manner to avert another crisis in the period ahead.",

    "text": "High inflation during 2022 was a global phenomenon. Global inflation accelerated to 8.8 per cent in 2022 (IMF, 2023) reflecting the impact of the lagged effects of ultra easy monetary and fiscal support following the COVID-19 pandemic, shortages of fuel and nonfuel commodities, exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine War and capacity constraints along with supply chain issues. Affected by global as well as domestic factors, Sri Lanka also experienced inflation at unprecedented levels in the year 2022, recording the largest increase in price levels in its history since independence. However, in late 2022, inflation started moderating from its peak levels, showing early signs of a disinflation process. This process is expected to be supported by several factors, eventually bringing inflation down to the targeted levels in the period ahead. Against this backdrop, it is important to understand the concepts of inflation, disinflation and the characteristics of past global disinflation episodes, and more importantly, the envisaged disinflation process of Sri Lanka, as various misconceptions and misinterpretations have come to the fore resulting in confusion and affecting inflation expectations of the public.",

The general price level represents an average of all prices in the economy as measured by a consumer price index. The most commonly used measures of the level of prices in Sri Lanka are the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) and the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI). In contrast, inflation is the rate at which the general price level increases over time, which is typically denoted as the percentage change in a consumer price index between two periods. Therefore, a decline in inflation compared to the previous period may not necessarily mean a drop in the general price level, but rather a reduction in the pace of increase in the general price level.",

Domestic inflation is affected by demand side factors, supply side factors, and the economic agent\u2019s expectations on the future course of inflation. Demand side factors are typically the outcomes of a growing economy, public expectations of future price movements, and macroeconomic policies (i.e., monetary policy and fiscal policy) aimed at influencing the aggregate demand conditions of the economy, whereas supply side factors could be the outcomes of either the supply side policies of the Government or some exogenous circumstances, such as natural disasters, global events, etc. As the people of Sri Lanka consume a considerable share of imported items, the country\u2019s inflation is also affected by the movements in global commodity prices. In addition, exchange rate movements affect inflation. For instance, a depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee against the US dollar (since most imports are valued in US dollar terms) will increase the price of imports in domestic currency terms.",

Alternatively, it can be defined as a sustained decrease in year-on-year inflation.

It is important to note that disinflation, following an episode of high inflation, is different from deflation, which refers to a sustained decrease in the general price level.

The objective of contractionary monetary policy is to bring back inflation to the targeted level and sustain it thereafter. Disinflation policies could be associated with short term costs in terms of subdued economic activity and rising unemployment. However, the long term gains for the economy on account of reduced distortions due to high inflation outweigh the short term costs. In the meantime, policymakers must also be vigilant of threats of future deflation during disinflation episodes, as sustained deflation can be highly destructive to a modern economy (Bernanke, 2012).",

The reduction in inflation in the US in the early 1980s, when the US Federal Reserve was headed by Paul Volcker, remains a widely discussed macroeconomic outcome (commonly referred to as \u2018Volcker disinflation\u2019). During the 1970s and early 1980, the general price levels in the US rose significantly. However, following the implementation of aggressive monetary policy measures by the US Federal Reserve, the annual inflation rate was brought down from a peak of 13.5 per cent in 1980 to 3.2 per cent by 1983. The US experienced two recessions during this period, which are generally attributed to disinflationary policies. However, \u2018Volcker disinflation\u2019 laid the foundation for the long economic expansions of the 1980s and 1990s in the US. In the meantime, Japan and Germany also experienced heightened levels of inflation in the early 1970s. However, by the late 1970s both countries recorded low inflation relative to other advanced economies. The success of this disinflation process is attributed to the strong discipline of the respective governments and monetary authorities, based on the understanding that inflation in the long run is a",

The IMF (2023) expects global inflation to fall in 2023 and 2024. If the envisaged moderation in global commodity prices is passed on to domestic prices via timely and transparent adjustments, the price momentum of imported inflation could be kept at a considerably low level in 2023. Furthermore, the stability of the exchange rate amidst an improved Balance of Payments (BOP) position would be helpful in this regard. The recent appreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee against the US dollar, if continued, could help lower imported inflation and reduce second-round effects associated with these imports, thereby supporting the disinflation process. In the meantime, Sri Lanka\u2019s import prices increased disproportionately during 2022 reflecting the substantial depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee and the increase in global commodity prices. This resulted in large month-on-month increases in prices of imported commodities, particularly around mid-2022. In the year 2023, this will influence imported inflation favourably through a sizeable negative base effect supporting the disinflation path (please see Figure B 1.2). On the other hand, with respect to domestic inflation, the price momentum is estimated to be",

In addition, some improvements were witnessed in domestic supply conditions over the last couple of months. As a result, the price momentum relating to food inflation recorded even negative values in certain months. The improved supply conditions are expected to continue through 2023, supporting the efforts to bring inflation to lower levels. Meanwhile, the adjustments made by the Government on various taxes as well as the revisions made to utility tariffs in 2022 and early 2023, together with their second-round effects, resulted in one-off upward adjustments in the general price level. Moreover, the supply side factors remained considerable in 2022 due to numerous shortages and bottlenecks witnessed in domestic supply conditions associated with the BOP crisis. The month-on-month increases in domestic prices in 2022 due to supply bottlenecks as well as tax and tariff revisions will influence inflation favourably in 2023 via a sizeable base effect (please see Figure B 1.2). Therefore, the moderation in domestic inflation in the period ahead is expected to be supported by a combination of subdued price momentum and a considerable base effect. The overall inflation of the country, which is an outcome of the expected dynamics of both imported and domestic inflation, along with the improving supply conditions, among others, is envisaged to reduce sustainably in 2023, enabling the realisation of the anticipated disinflation path.",

    "text": "The Sri Lankan economy has been experiencing frequent incidences of vulnerabilities and instability conditions instilled by structural macroeconomic problems coupled with global and domestic shocks. The conditions weakened drastically since 2020 with the onset of the pandemic, along with ad-hoc policy changes that exacerbated stresses in the economy. As a result, the country experienced severe Balance of Payments (BOP) distress and subsequently multiple crises in 2022. Several policy interventions were rolled out since early 2022 to guide the economy towards greater stability. Seeking financial assistance subject to macroeconomic stabilisation and related commencement of debt restructuring efforts to restore public debt sustainability are key steps that have been taken towards this journey. Before 2022, Sri Lanka had entered into numerous International Monetary Fund (IMF) programmes from time to time for various purposes including supporting the BOP and the Government\u2019s reform agenda. However, unlike on previous occasions, Sri Lanka initiated discussions with the IMF in early 2022 for an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement under the direst economic conditions. The success of policy interventions was constrained by debt overhang as well as persistently large fiscal and BOP financing needs. Amidst continuous downgrades in sovereign ratings, Sri Lanka was cut off from avenues for external financing, making new fundraising and servicing existing loans extremely challenging. Usable reserves depleted to near zero levels, the exchange rate depreciated at an unprecedented scale, access to fuel, electricity and other essential imported items by the public was limited, general price levels escalated to new heights with demand pressures and supply shortages, financial system stability was under threat, and social and political clashes were recurring in early 2022. Against this backdrop, the need for economic stabilisation with external assistance was required and the Sri Lankan authorities initiated discussions with the IMF. Continuous engagements over a year with the IMF staff team on the finalisation of the proposed economic and financial policies and successful completion of prescribed prior actions under the programme and the receipt of financial assurances from the official creditors enabled the approval of an EFF in late March 2023. Salient features of this economic adjustment programme, expected developments under the EFF arrangement, the country\u2019s commitment to the reforms in the ensuing period, and necessity of continuing this programme over four years are discussed briefly in the following sections.",

A CPC applies to the non-accumulation of new external payments arrears on external debt which will be monitored continuously by the authorities and any non-observance will be immediately reported to the IMF. In addition, another QPC includes the prohibition of imposing or intensifying restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, introducing or modifying multiple currency practices, concluding bilateral payment agreements that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the IMF\u2019s Articles of Agreement, and imposing or intensifying import restrictions for BOP purposes. A monetary policy consultation clause (MPCC) has also been included to monitor year-on-year inflation on specified target dates to ensure that Sri Lanka is moving on a steady disinflation path to reach the targeted level to restore price stability.

The severity of the current economic crisis faced by Sri Lanka highlights the importance of addressing the longstanding structural issues in a sustainable manner beyond the reforms agenda in the IMF programme through national policies which are formulated in consultation with stakeholders and free from political influences with vested interests. In this regard, the reforms agenda should focus on improving the productivity and output of the economy through technological innovations and increased economic connectivity to the world over trade and investment, by enhancing diversity in merchandise exports and potential services export sectors including tourism, IT/BPO sectors, and attracting FDI. It is also necessary to strengthen legal frameworks to ensure public accountability of state institutions, exercising available legal powers in policy formulation and implementation by relevant authorities to ensure lasting economic welfare in the country. These would complement the reforms agenda in the IMF-EFF arrangement to ensure that Sri Lanka attains and sustains macroeconomic stability in the earliest possible timeframe.",

This has been mainly due to the lack of commitment to meeting the conditionalities attached to such programmes, especially those related to structural reforms, which required painful macroeconomic adjustments and unpopular policies that were aimed at long term welfare enhancements. Therefore, it is imperative that Sri Lanka internalises these reforms in its policy formulation and implements the major areas of reforms in the current IMF programme as well as reforms beyond the programme to help the economy transform into greater stability and a higher growth path at the earliest while circumventing the need for repeated access to IMF bailouts and several rounds of debt restructuring in the future.",

This paved the way for the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act (CBA) to be drafted to include provisions strengthening the Central Bank independence, enhancing transparency and accountability and strengthening the monetary policy framework to ensure sustained price stability in Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, the CBA is also expected to strengthen the financial sector and macroprudential oversight and improve the governance of the Central Bank.

Such an environment allows an economy to achieve its growth potential. Further, in pursuing the primary objective, the Central Bank shall take into account the stabilisation of output towards its potential level. These arrangements are in accordance with the Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) framework that aims at stabilising inflation around the inflation target while minimising disturbance to the real economy. Further, on a rare occasion where the attention of both price stability and financial system stability is required, and the policy decision concerning either side is subject to a tradeoff, the Central Bank is expected to prioritise its primary object of price stability.",
