1.1 OverviewT

he Sri Lankan economy faced its most onerous year in its post-independence history in 2022, comprising severe economic hardship that led to both public anxiety and political upheaval. The impoverished conditions in the economy warranted immediate and coordinated policy initiatives by the Government and the Central Bank to preempt a further escalation of the situation. Although the corrective measures affected the vast citizenry in the near term, they were necessary to safeguard the economy and economic agents from potentially devastating consequences of unrestrained economic instability, such as hyperinflation, collapse of economic activity to a much deeper level, and a complete disconnect of the country from the rest of the world, with far worse consequences to the people and businesses. The outcomes of these efforts have eventuated since late 2022. The country managed to transition to a workable equilibrium in the near term, focused on restoring socio-economic stability, while the envisaged assistance from the international financial institutions begins to materialise.

Having run an unsustainable macroeconomic model in tandem with the longstanding deficits in the budget balance and the external current account, the economy had fully exhausted its buffers by early 2022 as it was straddled by a myriad of vulnerabilities that emanated from both global and domestic sources. Several inherent weaknesses of the economy, further exacerbated by policy lapses, steered the country towards a multifaceted disaster. Ill-timed tax reductions, an ill-equipped attempt to swiftly adopt organic agriculture, the depletion of the country’s official reserves amidst futile attempts to maintain an untarnished debt servicing record, the delay in the exchange rate adjustment, and the failure to pay heed to several early warning signals caused tremendous shockwaves across the economy. Consequently, the economy was battered by excessive balance of payments (BOP) pressures with acute shortage of foreign exchange liquidity and pressured exchange rate, spiralling inflation and dampened economic activity amidst mass loss of livelihoods, large fiscal imbalances, public debt reaching unsustainable levels with extraordinarily high risk premia, devastating sovereign rating downgrades that constrained access to external finance, unprecedented heightening of socio-economic and socio-political tensions, and rapidly deteriorating business confidence, among others. Businesses and the general public alike were in severe distress amidst shortages and rationing of essentials, the ballooning cost of living and cost of production, and the loss of welfare and livelihoods. Consequently, the rapid unfolding of social unrest resulted in political instability, warranting an urgent need for redefining policy priorities to steer the economy away from further turmoil.

Amidst mounting BOP pressures, the exchange rate was allowed a measured adjustment in early March 2022. However, the subsequent floating of the exchange rate resulted in an overshooting, fuelled by speculative activity. The Central Bank adopted aggressive monetary policy tightening in April 2022 to rein in demand pressures, complemented by a robust communication strategy aimed at anchoring inflation expectations, while taking measures to stabilise the exchange rate amidst exhausted levels of useable reserves by April

2022. Meanwhile, the Central Bank provided foreign exchange to the market to meet the demand for essential imports to the greatest extent possible amidst a dearth of foreign exchange inflows and significantly low levels of official reserves. Moreover, the Central Bank initiated measures to prioritise essential imports and restrict capital outflows through appropriate control measures, while continuing the requirement for the mandatory sale of foreign exchange to the Central Bank by licensed banks, based on the conversion of repatriated foreign exchange, and commenced providing daily guidance on the exchange rate to curtail undue intraday volatilities. Moreover, the Central Bank’s continuous financial sector oversight and adoption of appropriate regulatory measures along with effective communication ensured financial system stability amidst severe socio-economic distress.

The Government initiated measures in early 2022 to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after months of indecisiveness. The IMF had already assessed that Sri Lanka’s public debt had reached unsustainable levels, hence, any funding assistance from the IMF needed to be preceded by efforts to restructure public debt. Subsequently, when it reached a critical point of inability to service debt payments, the Government announced a debt standstill in mid-April 2022, thereby suspending the servicing of external debt, mainly bilateral and commercial debt, as an interim measure, while soliciting support from official and private creditors to restructure outstanding debt. Simultaneously, several initiatives were made by the Government to enhance government revenue, curtail expenditure, introduce reforms to major State Owned Enterprises (SOE), implement import controls, and ration energy supply, while exploring bridging finance from bilateral and multilateral partners for essential expenditures as well as supporting the most vulnerable segments. In September 2022, a staff level agreement was reached for an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) from the IMF, followed by efforts to secure financing assurances from official creditors towards the restructuring of debt, in line with the debt sustainability targets envisaged under the IMF-EFF supported programme. In March 2023, the Executive Board of the IMF approved the EFF supported programme of 48-months, amounting to approximately US dollars 3 billion, along with an economic adjustment programme that was aimed at putting Sri Lanka back on a recovery path, while addressing structural impediments that constrained the country’s growth potential over the past decades. With a multitude of goals to be achieved under the IMF-EFF arrangement, restoring public debt sustainability through the debt restructuring process will be one of the key milestones in the path towards attaining a sustained growth in the economy. However, debt restructuring could pose near term challenges in the financial sector that need to be addressed proactively by the Government and Central Bank, thereby reinforcing the financial system stability in the period ahead.

Policy measures and reforms implemented by the Government and the Central Bank have yielded notable success thus far. Inflation returned to an impressive disinflation path following a historic peak in September 2022, and the exchange rate remained stable and registered an appreciation in early 2023, having depreciated sharply during the first half of 2022. Further, the external current account deficit remained modest alongside the gradual accumulation of official reserves, thereby enabling the reinstatement of exchange rate flexibility from early March 2023. The envisaged normalisation of foreign exchange flows and the completion of the debt restructuring process during 2023, and the sweeping reforms in the public sector, are expected to pave way for the country’s progress towards improved and sustainable economic prospects.

The socio-economic crisis in 2022 underlined many lessons that the country failed to grasp, despite the recurrence of such macroeconomic failures throughout its post-independence history. This economic episode reiterated the essentiality of data-driven policymaking; devastating implications of ad hoc policy experiments; crippling welfare impacts of myopic populist policies; and the cost of policy delays, disregarding evidence-based policy analysis, well-established economic fundamentals and expert opinions. The general public and businesses at large had to bear the cost of a one-time adjustment of delayed structural reforms. Against this backdrop, the Government, the Central Bank, and all other stakeholders need to extend their support towards the implementation of essential reforms at this juncture, to resolve the structural hindrances that have rooted in the economy over the last seven and a half decades. Failing to execute such reforms would lead to perpetual bailouts, endless cycles of external borrowing and recurring debt restructuring alongside unsustainable and highly volatile business cycles, which would cause undue pressure on citizenry, preventing the country from achieving longstanding economic progress and prosperity. Hence, in the country’s efforts to emerge from the current crisis, consistent and well-coordinated policies, including those outlined in the IMF-EFF supported programme, should be executed in a timely manner to avert another crisis in the period ahead.

1.2 Macroeconomic

Developments in 2022

Real Sector Developments and Inflation

In 2022, the Sri Lankan economy registered

its deepest economic contraction since

independence, mainly driven by the ripple

effects of the unprecedented economic crisis

amidst the domestic and global headwinds that

reversed the post-pandemic recovery. As per the

provisional estimates of the Department of Census

and Statistics (DCS), the real GDP contracted by

7.8 per cent in 2022, compared to the growth of 3.5

per cent in 2021. Longstanding macroeconomic

weaknesses, characterised by deeply entrenched

twin deficits, due to persistent budget deficits

and external current account deficits, worsened

during 2022, reflecting the impact of policy delays

in addressing these imbalances over the years,

particularly in recent years, amidst ill-timed and

ill-equipped reforms in taxation and agricultural

policies, among others. Acute fuel shortages due to

the dearth of foreign exchange caused a significant

drag on activities, as a result of hampered supply

chains, prolonged power outages, scarcity of raw

materials amidst imports compression, and a surge

in the cost of production. Further, significant upward

revisions in major utility prices amidst soaring

global energy prices and the depreciation of the

exchange rate exacerbated supply side pressures,

while accelerated inflation and tax hikes affected

the disposable income of households. Against this

backdrop, the Government and the Central Bank

initiated several containment and remedial policy

measures aimed at preempting a major economic

catastrophe that would otherwise have occurred,

leading to hyperinflation and depression in the

economy. The significant monetary policy tightening

measures, along with the other measures to contain

the balance of payments (BOP) pressures, and

the unprecedented fiscal reforms in taxation and

utility prices, along with the fuel rationing system,

among others, helped contain demand side

related excessive price pressures, improve foreign

exchange liquidity conditions, minimise external and

fiscal sector stresses, support economic activity,

and steer the economy towards stability, albeit with

some significant adjustment costs in the near term.

Meanwhile, the Government sought assistance from

the IMF for a funding arrangement and announced

a debt standstill as an interim measure, pending

negotiations on debt restructuring with bilateral and

commercial creditors. These swift and remedial

measures of the Government and Central Bank

helped contain the fall of economic activity and instil

confidence in the economy.

Real economy witnessed a broad-based

contraction in 2022, reversing the post-

pandemic recovery in 2021. The agriculture

sector, which had been experiencing lacklustre

performances since 2019, contracted by 4.6 per cent

in 2022, compared to a year earlier. This mainly

reflected the severe shortages in chemical fertiliser

and other agrochemicals, increased cost of raw

materials, as well as the disruptions of supply

networks. The subsectors of growing of rice, tea,

vegetables, animal production, and marine fishing

and marine aquaculture largely contributed to the

overall contraction in the agriculture sector, while

growing of oleaginous fruit and forestry, and

logging recorded growths during the year. In 2022,

the industry sector contracted notably by 16.0 per

cent, year-on-year, primarily due to the dampened

performance of the construction and manufacturing

subsectors amidst severe shortages in raw

materials and input cost escalations. The energy

crisis and tighter monetary conditions also weighed

on the performance of the industry subsectors.

The construction subsector, which accounted for

28.0 per cent of the industry sector, registered a

year-on-year contraction of 20.9 per cent, while

overall manufacturing activities, which accounted

for about 59 per cent in the total industry sector,

contracted by 12.6 per cent, year-on-year, in 2022.

Within the manufacturing sector, manufacture of coke

and refined petroleum products, and manufacture

of food, beverages, and tobacco products

registered notable contractions of 58.2 per cent and

14.2 per cent, respectively, while the subsector of

manufacture of textiles, wearing apparel, leather,

and other related products registered a year-on-year

growth of 8.1 per cent in 2022. Meanwhile, mining

and quarrying activities also reported a notable

year-on-year contraction of 31.0 per cent in 2022.

Despite the resilient performance in the services

sector during the first quarter of 2022, supported by

the gradual normalisation of services sector activity

following the COVID-19 pandemic, economic

headwinds that intensified thereafter, hindered a

further expansion in the services sector, resulting in

an overall contraction of 2.0 per cent, year-on-year,

in 2022. Although the subsectors of accommodation,

food, and beverage, as well as transportation of goods

and passengers, witnessed a strong rebound with

year-on-year growths of 27.0 per cent and 3.5 per cent,

respectively, the services sector performance was

hampered by notable contractions in the subsectors

of wholesale and retail trade, financial services, and

real estate activities during the year.

In nominal terms, the Sri Lankan economy

recorded a significant expansion of 37.2 per cent

in 2022, year-on-year, compared to that of 12.3

per cent in the preceding year, reflecting the large

deflator during the year. However, the overall size

of the economy in US dollar terms contracted to US

dollars 77.1 billion in 2022, compared to US dollars

88.5 billion in 2021, due to the large depreciation of

the exchange rate. Per capita GDP also declined to

US dollars 3,474 in 2022 from US dollars 3,997 in

2021. As per the expenditure approach, consumption

expenditure, which accounted for 69.2 per cent of

the GDP, expanded by 34.3 per cent, year-on-year,

in 2022, compared to the expansion of 8.4 per cent

in 2021, largely contributing to the overall nominal

growth of the economy. Accordingly, reflecting the

sharp acceleration in inflation during the period,

household consumption expenditure grew at a

higher rate of 39.0 per cent in 2022, compared to the

9.4 per cent expansion recorded in the preceding

year. Government consumption expenditure also

grew by 3.8 per cent in 2022, in comparison to 2.3

per cent recorded in 2021. Meanwhile, investment

expenditure grew by 28.4 per cent, year-on-year,

during the year, compared to the 25.1 per cent

growth recorded in 2021. Accordingly, investment

as a percentage of nominal GDP stood at 34.4

per cent in 2022, compared to 36.7 per cent in

the previous year. Reflecting the impact of notable

expansion in exports, buttressed by the depreciation

in domestic currency, and restrained imports amidst

import controls and subdued aggregate demand,

the net external demand for goods and services at

current prices improved notably by 34.1 per cent,

year-on-year, during 2022. Accordingly, the net

nominal external balance of goods and services, as

a percentage of GDP, stood at -3.6 per cent in 2022,

compared to -7.4 per cent in 2021.

In 2022, unemployment levels in the economy

declined marginally, despite the challenges

to labour productivity, caused by fragile

macroeconomic conditions. The labour force

participation rate (LFPR), which is the ratio of the

labour force to the working age population, decreased

marginally to 49.8 per cent in 2022, compared to 49.9

per cent in 2021, with an increase in the economically

inactive population during the year. The male LFPR

recorded a decline to 70.5 per cent in 2022, from 71.0

per cent recorded in the previous year. On a positive

note, the female LFPR increased to 32.1 per cent in

2022, compared to 31.8 per cent in 2021. Nevertheless,

the annual unemployment rate declined to

4.7 per cent in 2022, compared to 5.1 per cent in 2021,

despite an increasing trend in the unemployment rate

that was observed in the second and third quarters

of 2022. Meanwhile, persistent disruptions to supply

channels, caused by acute fuel shortages, intermittent

power outages, as well as shortages of inputs due to

import restrictions, hindered the optimal use of labour

during the period under review, partially contributing

to the slowdown in value additions to the economy.

Accordingly, labour productivity, measured in terms

of Gross Value Added (GVA) (in 2015 prices) per

hour worked, declined by 10.6 per cent, to Rs. 686.57

per hour worked in 2022, from Rs. 768.08 per hour

worked in 2021.

Consumer price inflation reached a historic

high in September 2022 and commenced a

descending path thereafter, with the realisation

of the impact of tight monetary conditions and

the gradual easing of supply side disruptions.

During the nine months ending September 2022,

headline inflation was on a rapid acceleration path

reflecting price pressures from multiple fronts,

including price hikes in food, energy, and transport

sectors and their spillovers, stemming from supply

disruptions, rapid adjustments to administered

prices, sharp depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee,

and aggregate demand pressures owing to the

lagged impact of monetary accommodation

undertaken over the past few years, among others.

However, the impact of significantly tight monetary

policy and other demand management measures,

such as prioritising essential imports, along with

the softening of food and energy prices helped

moderate the pace of headline inflation from the

latter part of 2022. Accordingly, year-on-year

headline inflation, as measured by the Colombo

Consumer Price Index (CCPI, 2013=100), which

was recorded at 12.1 per cent at the end of 2021,

accelerated to 69.8 per cent in September 2022,

before moderating to 57.2 per cent by December

2022. Following a similar trend, year-on-year

headline inflation, based on the National Consumer

Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100), was recorded at

73.7 per cent by end September 2022 and 59.2

per cent by end 2022, compared to 14.0 per cent

registered at end 2021. The DCS revised the base

year of both the CCPI and the NCPI from 2013

to 2021, in order to accommodate the changing

expenditure patterns and to incorporate changes

in goods and services available in the market. The

downward trend of headline inflation observed

in the latter part of 2022 continued into 2023 as

well. Accordingly, year-on-year headline inflation,

based on the CCPI (2021=100), decelerated

further to 50.3 per cent in March 2023, although

the pace of deceleration was slower than in recent

months, due to the full impact of the electricity

price revision being accounted for during March

2023. Meanwhile, year-on-year headline inflation,

based on the NCPI (2021=100), stood at 53.6 per

cent by February 2023. Signs of further easing of

prices of certain imported goods were observed

recently with the appreciation of the Sri Lanka

rupee, and the revisions of petroleum prices in

late March 2023 would help quicken disinflation

in the ensuing months. Core inflation, which

excludes the volatile food and energy prices,

and measures the underlying demand pressures,

also increased during the nine months ending

September 2022 before trending downward.

The rise in core inflation was mainly due to the

pent-up demand stemming from the lagged

impact of monetary accommodation in recent

High inflation during 2022 was a global phenomenon. Global inflation accelerated to 8.8 per cent in 2022 (IMF, 2023) reflecting the impact of the lagged effects of ultra easy monetary and fiscal support following the COVID-19 pandemic, shortages of fuel and nonfuel commodities, exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine War and capacity constraints along with supply chain issues. Affected by global as well as domestic factors, Sri Lanka also experienced inflation at unprecedented levels in the year 2022, recording the largest increase in price levels in its history since independence. However, in late 2022, inflation started moderating from its peak levels, showing early signs of a disinflation process. This process is expected to be supported by several factors, eventually bringing inflation down to the targeted levels in the period ahead. Against this backdrop, it is important to understand the concepts of inflation, disinflation and the characteristics of past global disinflation episodes, and more importantly, the envisaged disinflation process of Sri Lanka, as various misconceptions and misinterpretations have come to the fore resulting in confusion and affecting inflation expectations of the public.

The Concept of Inflation

A change in inflation is sometimes misinterpreted as a corresponding change in the price level. The general price level represents an average of all prices in the economy as measured by a consumer price index. The most commonly used measures of the level of prices in Sri Lanka are the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) and the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI). In contrast, inflation is the rate at which the general price level increases over time, which is typically denoted as the percentage change in a consumer price index between two periods. Therefore, a decline in inflation compared to the previous period may not necessarily mean a drop in the general price level, but rather a reduction in the pace of increase in the general price level.

The most commonly used measures of inflation are the year-on-year change and the month-on-month change in a consumer price index. The month-on-month measure of inflation provides an assessment of price movements in the most recent month under consideration, compared to the preceding month. Hence, this measure is also referred to as the ‘price

BOX 1Sri Lanka’s Disinflation Process

momentum’ or the ‘momentum of inflation’. Inflation measured by the year-on-year change in a consumer price index, however, depends on two factors: the price movements in the current month and the price movements recorded one year ago. The latter is referred to as the ‘base effect’, which is the contribution to the change in the year-on-year inflation that stems from the month-on-month inflation in the base period (i.e., one year ago). The recent movements of the CCPI (Base: 2013 = 100)1 and year-on-year inflation are depicted in Figure B 1.1. The figure illustrates that the year-on-year inflation in a given month (e.g., Dec. 2022) depends upon the consumer price index in the corresponding month and the value of the same 12 months earlier (i.e., Dec. 2021).

Furthermore, the change in year-on-year inflation can be approximated by the month-on-month inflation in the current period (momentum effect), less the month-on-month inflation twelve months ago (base effect).2 Hence, in order to assess the dynamics of inflation in Sri Lanka, especially the envisaged

1 Compilation of the CCPI (2013=100) was discontinued by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) in February 2023 and it was replaced by the CCPI (2021=100). Inflation (year-on-year) based on the CCPI (2021=100) is available from January 2023.

2 As shown in the mathematical representation below, the year-on-year inflation (πt) depends on the consumer price index in a given month (Pt) and the value of the same 12 months earlier (Pt-12).

Once the mathematical representation of the year-on-year inflation is approximated using natural logarithms (ln), the difference between the year-on-year inflation in two successive months can be written as follows.

It is noteworthy that the approximation using natural logarithms is valid only when the variable under consideration (i.e., inflation) is a small number in percentage terms.

disinflation process, one should have a clear understanding of the movements in price levels in the past one year period, i.e., the base effects, and the expected future path of price levels, i.e., the expected price momentum. Figure B 1.2 depicts inflation dynamics in recent times in terms of momentum and base effects. The figure illustrates that the monthly change in year-on-year inflation can be approximated by the summation of the momentum effect and the base effect, particularly during periods where the year-on-year inflation is small.

Sources of Inflation in Sri Lanka

Being a small open economy, Sri Lanka’s overall inflation is a combination of both domestic and imported inflation. Domestic inflation is affected by demand side factors, supply side factors, and the economic agent’s expectations on the future course of inflation. Demand side factors are typically the outcomes of a growing economy, public expectations of future price movements, and macroeconomic policies (i.e., monetary policy and fiscal policy) aimed at influencing the aggregate demand conditions of the economy, whereas supply side factors could be the outcomes of either the supply side policies of the Government or some exogenous circumstances, such as natural disasters, global events, etc. As the people of Sri Lanka consume a considerable share of imported items, the country’s inflation is also affected by the movements in global commodity prices. In addition, exchange rate movements affect inflation. For instance, a depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee against the US dollar (since most imports are valued in US dollar terms) will increase the price of imports in domestic currency terms.

What is Disinflation?

Disinflation is interpreted as a slowdown in the rate of increase of the general price level in an economy. Alternatively, it can be defined as a sustained decrease in year-on-year inflation. Disinflation is a process that typically takes place over the short to medium term until inflation reaches the desired level and price stability is restored. It is important to note that disinflation, following an episode of high inflation, is different from deflation, which refers to a sustained decrease in the general price level. Disinflation results in a lower level of inflation where the prices are still rising, but at a slower rate.

In general, gradual disinflation is brought about by contractionary monetary policy as well as supply conditions turning favourable. The objective of contractionary monetary policy is to bring back inflation to the targeted level and sustain it thereafter. Disinflation policies could be associated with short term costs in terms of subdued economic activity and rising unemployment. However, the long term gains for the economy on account of reduced distortions due to high inflation outweigh the short term costs. In the meantime, policymakers must also be vigilant of threats of future deflation during disinflation episodes, as sustained deflation can be highly destructive to a modern economy (Bernanke, 2012).

Globally, there have been several noticeable disinflation episodes. The reduction in inflation in the US in the early 1980s, when the US Federal Reserve was headed by Paul Volcker, remains a widely discussed macroeconomic outcome (commonly referred to as ‘Volcker disinflation’). During the 1970s and early 1980, the general price levels in the US rose significantly. However, following the implementation of aggressive monetary policy measures by the US Federal Reserve, the annual inflation rate was brought down from a peak of 13.5 per cent in 1980 to 3.2 per cent by 1983. The US experienced two recessions during this period, which are generally attributed to disinflationary policies. However, ‘Volcker disinflation’ laid the foundation for the long economic expansions of the 1980s and 1990s in the US. In the meantime, Japan and Germany also experienced heightened levels of inflation in the early 1970s. However, by the late 1970s both countries recorded low inflation relative to other advanced economies. The success of this disinflation process is attributed to the strong discipline of the respective governments and monetary authorities, based on the understanding that inflation in the long run is a

monetary phenomenon (Nelson, 2007). Furthermore, productivity improvements can also help the disinflation process. Aggregate demand pressures can be lessened due to the expansion of the potential GDP in the long run through effective supply side policies. Moreover, higher productivity, deregulation and increased globalisation are also weighed as possible causes for the considerable drop in global inflation from the elevated levels in the 1970s and early 1980s (Rogoff, 2004).

The Envisaged Disinflation Process in Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka’s inflation started moderating from its peak levels of around 70 per cent (year-on-year) in September 2022, confirming that the disinflation process had started as envisaged. In terms of economic factors, this process is expected to be supported by subdued aggregate demand conditions due to tight monetary and fiscal policies, expected improvements in domestic supply conditions, improved external sector performance, normalisation of global commodity prices, and the timely passthrough of such reductions to domestic prices. Statistically, the disinflation process is anticipated to be influenced by both the momentum effect and the base effect, with a higher contribution expected from the latter.

Moreover, the effects of statistical factors can be assessed within the context of sources of inflation and expected economic developments. The IMF (2023) expects global inflation to fall in 2023 and 2024. If the envisaged moderation in global commodity prices is passed on to domestic prices via timely and transparent adjustments, the price momentum of imported inflation could be kept at a considerably low level in 2023. Furthermore, the stability of the exchange rate amidst an improved Balance of Payments (BOP) position would be helpful in this regard. The recent appreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee against the US dollar, if continued, could help lower imported inflation and reduce second-round effects associated with these imports, thereby supporting the disinflation process. In the meantime, Sri Lanka’s import prices increased disproportionately during 2022 reflecting the substantial depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee and the increase in global commodity prices. This resulted in large month-on-month increases in prices of imported commodities, particularly around mid-2022. In the year 2023, this will influence imported inflation favourably through a sizeable negative base effect supporting the disinflation path (please see Figure B 1.2). On the other hand, with respect to domestic inflation, the price momentum is estimated to be

significantly low on account of unprecedented monetary policy tightening measures and an extremely tight fiscal policy stance. In addition, some improvements were witnessed in domestic supply conditions over the last couple of months. As a result, the price momentum relating to food inflation recorded even negative values in certain months. The improved supply conditions are expected to continue through 2023, supporting the efforts to bring inflation to lower levels. Meanwhile, the adjustments made by the Government on various taxes as well as the revisions made to utility tariffs in 2022 and early 2023, together with their second-round effects, resulted in one-off upward adjustments in the general price level. Moreover, the supply side factors remained considerable in 2022 due to numerous shortages and bottlenecks witnessed in domestic supply conditions associated with the BOP crisis. The month-on-month increases in domestic prices in 2022 due to supply bottlenecks as well as tax and tariff revisions will influence inflation favourably in 2023 via a sizeable base effect (please see Figure B 1.2). Therefore, the moderation in domestic inflation in the period ahead is expected to be supported by a combination of subdued price momentum and a considerable base effect. The overall inflation of the country, which is an outcome of the expected dynamics of both imported and domestic inflation, along with the improving supply conditions, among others, is envisaged to reduce sustainably in 2023, enabling the realisation of the anticipated disinflation path.

The Central Bank’s ‘inflation fan chart’ presents the projections for future inflation, on a quarterly basis, in the form of confidence intervals (CI). The confidence intervals illustrate the uncertainty surrounding the

inflation forecast, with the degree of uncertainty widening as the forecast horizon increases. The Central Bank’s latest projections for year-on-year headline inflation, based on CCPI (2021=100), are depicted in Figure B 1.3 in the form of an inflation fan chart.

Global inflation, which is estimated to have peaked in 2022, is expected to decline in 2023 and remain at subdued levels in 2024, in light of substantial monetary tightening and the resultant slowing of activity, normalisation of supply chains, and moderating prices of energy and other commodities. Figure B 1.4 depicts inflation projections of selected countries as per their most recent monetary policy reports. The figure shows that in many countries, inflation increased substantially in 2022, beyond the central banks' inflation targets. However, these countries are expecting a sharp disinflation in 2023, as is the case with Sri Lanka, in a synchronous manner.

The Role of Inflation Expectations and Inflation Forecasts

The disinflation process of the country is also expected to be reinforced by well-anchored inflation expectations. Inflation expectations reflect the rate at which the stakeholders in an economy expect prices to change in the future. Inflation expectations matter because actual inflation depends, in part, on what the public expects it to be, as expectations could influence spending, borrowing and investment decisions today. Therefore, the disinflation process involves a deliberate course of action by a central bank to change the prevailing expectations of economic agents, if such expectations are higher than the medium term inflation target. In Sri Lanka, inflation expectations destabilised to some extent following the high inflation episode in 2022. However,

with the proactive implementation of remedial monetary policy measures, along with an effective and transparent monetary policy communications strategy, including the publication of medium term inflation projections, a persistent reduction in the expected level of inflation was observed recently among the public, which in turn has helped improve the credibility of the Central Bank as well. As the disinflation process progresses, a further improvement in this regard can be expected, affirming the anchoring of medium term inflation expectations in line with the Central Bank’s inflation target.

Frequent communication of the estimated short to medium term inflation path remains a key element of the disinflation process. Towards this end, the Central Bank will continue to publish its inflation fan chart in press releases following regular monetary policy reviews and in other communiqués as appropriate. Any discrepancy between the medium term inflation forecast and the inflation target prompts policy measures to close the gap. Frequent and transparent communication of the inflation path would also serve as a mechanism to ensure commitment from the Central Bank to restore and maintain price stability.

Further, the Central Bank will commence publishing a forward looking semi-annual monetary policy report from the second half of 2023. This report will mainly display medium term projections for inflation and the underlying factors for the projections as well as an explanation of the deviation of actual inflation from the published forecast, if any.

A key factor for the disinflation process is the credibility of the central bank, as discussed above. This will help anchor inflation expectations. The credibility of the Central Bank is highly related to the independence of the Bank. In this regard, the envisaged enactment of the new Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act will contribute immensely to improving the independence and credibility of the Central Bank, which in turn will support the current disinflation episode and further strengthen the anchoring of inflation expectations.

years, the surge in imported prices, as well as

increases in the cost of non-food categories, such

as restaurants and hotels, health, and education,

etc. Accordingly, year-on-year core inflation,

based on the CCPI (2013=100), was recorded

at 47.7 per cent by December 2022, compared

to 8.3 per cent recorded at end 2021. The NCPI

(2013=100) based core inflation also accelerated

to 57.5 per cent, year-on-year, by December

2022, in comparison to 10.8 in December 2021.

Similar to headline inflation, core inflation also

continued to trend downwards during early

2023. Accordingly, the CCPI (2021=100) based

year-on-year core inflation decreased to

39.1 per cent by March 2023, while the NCPI

(2021=100) based year-on-year core inflation

decreased to 50.1 per cent by February 2023. This

continued reduction in core inflation was attributed

to the strong policy measures taken by the Central

Bank to address the build-up of demand driven

inflationary pressures and adverse inflation

expectations. Meanwhile, inflation expectations,

which remained at elevated levels during the

inflation acceleration period up to September

2022, broadly followed a downward trend during

the disinflation period.

External Sector Developments

Sri Lanka’s external sector met with severe

BOP stresses in 2022 amidst constrained

foreign financial inflows, depleted gross official

reserves, and overshooting of the exchange

rate, necessitating a myriad of policy measures

to avoid further aggravation of the situation

and restore external balance. The Government

sought assistance from the IMF for a funding

arrangement and announced a debt standstill as

an interim measure, pending negotiations on debt

restructuring with bilateral and commercial creditors

during early 2022. The Government and the Central

Bank initiated measures to limit foreign exchange

outflows, while taking initiatives to promote inflows.

Import demand was reduced notably, reflecting the

impact of significantly tightened monetary policy

and subdued demand conditions. A series of import

prioritisation measures was initiated, while continuing

the existing restrictive measures. These restrictions

included temporary suspensions and imposition

of licensing and margin deposit requirements on

selected imports. Also, restrictions on selected

import payment methods were imposed with a view

to discouraging grey market activities. Limitations on

certain foreign exchange outflows of capital nature

were also continued. Further, workers’ remittances

through official channels were encouraged through

cash based and non-cash based targeted incentives

for migrant workers. The large depreciation of the

exchange rate, restrictions on imports under certain

payment terms, such as open account terms, and

subdued demand for imports led to a correction in

the large spread between the official exchange rate

and rates offered in the informal market. This further

encouraged remittances through formal channels. A

significant reduction in the trade deficit was observed

in the second half of 2022 as import expenditure

declined and export earnings remained resilient.

The surplus in the services account increased to

some extent due to the increase in earnings from

tourism. However, all other sectors in the services

account, including air and sea freight, transportation,

and services inflows to the Information Technology

and Business Process Outsourcing (IT/BPO) sector

remained significantly subdued compared to the

previous year. The secondary income account

surplus reduced in 2022 despite the significant

improvement in workers’ remittances towards the

second half of 2022, while the primary income

account deficit, compiled on an accrual basis,

marginally moderated during the year compared to

the previous year. With these developments, the

14

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

1

current account deficit narrowed to 1.9 per cent of

GDP in 2022, from 3.7 per cent of GDP in 2021.

Despite net foreign investment inflows into the

Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) (including primary

market purchases) and the government securities

market, inflows to the financial account remained

modest due to the decline in foreign inflows to the

Government. Meanwhile, gross official reserves

declined to US dollars 1.9 billion as at end 2022,

in comparison to US dollars 3.1 billion recorded in

the previous year. However, this included the swap

facility from the People’s Bank of China equivalent to

around US dollars 1.4 billion as at end 2022, which

is subject to the conditionalities on its usability. The

Central Bank absorbed US dollars 2.1 billion from

the domestic foreign exchange market during 2022,

mainly from mandatory sales by licensed banks,

while supplying US dollars 2.7 billion mainly to meet

foreign exchange required for importing essential

commodities, such as fuel, coal, cooking gas, etc.

The Central Bank played a major role in managing

foreign exchange to ensure the supply of essential

goods and services under extremely challenging

circumstances during 2022. Meanwhile, total external

debt of the country amounted to US dollars 49.7

billion as at end 2022, compared to US dollars 51.8

billion recorded as at end 2021, reflecting the impact

of lack of access to foreign funding sources and large

valuation changes in commercial debt. Despite the

notable increase in the outstanding foreign loans

of the Government, the total external debt of the

Government remained at similar levels due to the

reduction in the outstanding value of ISBs issued by

the Government that were valued at market prices.

The Government obtained a number of emergency

credit facilities for the importation of essential goods,

including fuel, medicine and fertiliser, from regional

countries in the form of bilateral loans, resulting in

significant foreign loan disbursements during 2022.

The temporary suspension of debt servicing to

bilateral and commercial creditors provided some

respite in terms of lesser foreign loan repayments. The

significant shortage in liquidity in the domestic foreign

exchange market exerted pressures on the exchange

rate, necessitating a measured adjustment in the

exchange rate in early March 2022 by the Monetary

Board. However, market speculation resulted in an

overshooting of the exchange rate subsequently.

Accordingly, the Sri Lanka rupee depreciated

substantially by 41.4 per cent against the US dollar

by end April 2022. From mid-May 2022, with the aim

of curbing any significant intraday volatility due to

excessive speculation, the Central Bank commenced

offering market guidance by publishing a middle rate

and a variation margin applicable to the interbank

weighted average spot exchange rate. This measure

was effective in stabilising the exchange rate since

then, helping to mitigate the adverse macroeconomic

implications of excessive depreciation and volatility

of the currency. Reflecting these developments, the

Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) and Real

Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indices, which

measure the movement of the Sri Lanka rupee

against a basket of currencies and thus the external

competitiveness, declined notably in 2022. Overall,

the REER indices declined substantially below the

threshold of 100 index points, signalling that the

exchange rate remained sufficiently competitive for

international trade.

Sri Lanka secured IMF Executive Board

approval for the EFF arrangement of SDR

2,286 million (approximately US dollars

3,000 million) in March 2023, and the first

tranche of SDR 254 million (approximately US

dollars 333 million) was disbursed under the

programme in late March 2023. Following the

staff level agreement reached with the IMF for the

EFF supported programme in September 2022,

Sri Lanka commenced a dialogue with bilateral

creditors to secure financing assurances, while

engaging with commercial creditors in good

faith negotiations. Further, Sri Lanka initiated

measures to complete all prior actions needed

to secure the approval of the IMF Executive

Board. Towards the finalisation of the IMF-EFF

arrangement, several favourable developments

were initiated from early 2023. With a view

to encouraging activity in the domestic forex

market and restoring a market driven exchange

rate in line with the flexible inflation targeting

framework of the Central Bank, the Central

Bank commenced a gradual relaxation of the

daily variation band, while also loosening the

mandatory sales requirement by licensed banks,

before completely removing this requirement

from early March 2023. Foreign exchange market

liquidity conditions started to improve from early

2023, supported by foreign currency inflows to

the services sector, workers’ remittances and

financial flows to portfolio investment, and return

of market confidence following the finalisation of

the IMF-EFF arrangement. Reflecting the impact

of improving foreign exchange market conditions,

the exchange rate showed a large appreciation

bias during early March 2023, correcting the

exchange rate overshooting witnessed in early

2022 and helping the build-up of official reserves

through the intervention of the Central Bank in the

market, with sizeable purchases. With the funding

assistance under the IMF-EFF arrangement and

the purchases of foreign exchange from the

market, gross official reserves strengthened to

about US dollars 2.7 billion by end March 2023,

and the Sri Lanka rupee appreciated against

the US dollar by 10.9 per cent by end March

2023, reflecting the improved market sentiments.

Reflecting the greater flexibility that was allowed

in the determination of the exchange rate, the

Sri Lanka rupee showed some volatility from late

March 2023.

The funds disbursed under the EFF

arrangement are proposed to constitute budget

support, with a view to helping the domestic

financing needs of the Government. However,

proceeds so received will also help cushion BOP

constraints due to their availability for the repayment

of foreign currency obligations of the Government

that are not subject to debt restructuring, which

would otherwise have been made from the Central

Bank’s reserves, and possible strengthening of

1Introduction

The Sri Lankan economy has been experiencing frequent incidences of vulnerabilities and instability conditions instilled by structural macroeconomic problems coupled with global and domestic shocks. The conditions weakened drastically since 2020 with the onset of the pandemic, along with ad-hoc policy changes that exacerbated stresses in the economy. As a result, the country experienced severe Balance of Payments (BOP) distress and subsequently multiple crises in 2022. Several policy interventions were rolled out since early 2022 to guide the economy towards greater stability. Seeking financial assistance subject to macroeconomic stabilisation and related commencement of debt restructuring efforts to restore public debt sustainability are key steps that have been taken towards this journey. Before 2022, Sri Lanka had entered into numerous International Monetary Fund (IMF) programmes from time to time for various purposes including supporting the BOP and the Government’s reform agenda. However, unlike on previous occasions, Sri Lanka initiated discussions with the IMF in early 2022 for an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement under the direst economic conditions. The success of policy interventions was constrained by debt overhang as well as persistently large fiscal and BOP financing needs. Amidst continuous downgrades in sovereign ratings, Sri Lanka was cut off from avenues for external financing, making new fundraising and servicing existing loans extremely challenging. Usable reserves depleted to near zero levels, the exchange rate depreciated at an unprecedented scale, access to fuel, electricity and other essential imported items by the public was limited, general price levels escalated to new heights with demand pressures and supply shortages, financial system stability was under threat, and social and political clashes were recurring in early 2022. Against this backdrop, the need for economic stabilisation with external assistance was required and the Sri Lankan authorities initiated discussions with the IMF. Continuous engagements over a year with the IMF staff team on the finalisation of the proposed economic and financial policies and successful completion of prescribed prior actions under the programme and the receipt of financial assurances from the official creditors enabled the approval of an EFF in late March 2023. Salient features of this economic adjustment programme, expected developments under the EFF arrangement, the country’s commitment to the reforms in the ensuing period, and necessity of continuing this programme over four years are discussed briefly in the following sections.

Programme Objectives and Modalities of the IMF-EFF

The current IMF-EFF arrangement spans 48 months with the total disbursement amounting to SDR 2.286 billion (about US dollars 3 billion) to be utilised for budget

support for the Government. However, the proceeds under the EFF would also help cushion the BOP by supplementing the Gross Official Reserves (GOR). The disbursement will be equally divided into nine tranches subject to semi-annual reviews and subsequent Executive Board approvals. The first tranche was received in March 2023 immediately following Board approval. The programme aims at restoring macroeconomic stability at large. This overall economic stability is designed to be achieved through building strong pillars on critical areas of restoring debt sustainability, advancing revenue based fiscal consolidation, restoring price stability and building external buffers, ensuring financial stability, reducing corruption vulnerabilities, and raising potential growth.

Prior Actions and Structural Benchmarks

Since the commencement of negotiations for the IMF-EFF arrangement in early 2022, Sri Lanka has completed nine prior actions by March 2023 and has formulated a mechanism for meeting the structural benchmarks. The completion of these prior actions was instrumental in paving the way for broader reforms to be implemented in the next four years under the EFF. The prior actions that have been already completed by Sri Lanka include, obtaining Cabinet approval for revenue measures to support fiscal consolidation during 2023 in line with programme parameters, obtaining Parliamentary approval for a revised 2022 budget, submission of the 2023 Appropriation Bill to the Parliament, obtaining Cabinet approval to automate monthly retail fuel price adjustment, to automate semi-annual cost-recovery based electricity price adjustment, Cabinet approval of the new Central Bank Act, Cabinet approval for the amendments to the Banking Act, strengthening key elements of the Central Bank’s crisis management powers, hiring an independent firm to conduct banking sector diagnostic exercise, and increasing policy interest rates by 100 basis points to ensure forward looking real policy interest rates are on a firm upward path.

In addition to the above, three important upfront measures were also implemented which include Parliamentary approval of the 2023 budget that was in line with programme parameters, Parliamentary approval of necessary legislative revisions to implement the 2023 revenue measures, and updating the Emergency Liquidity Assistance framework for banks. Further, Sri Lanka is required to implement several structural benchmarks related to fiscal matters, State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), social safety net reforms, and monetary and exchange rate policies and reforms related to fiscal sector and governance in the period ahead, as detailed in Figure B 2.1.

Monitoring of Programme Progress

Performance of the EFF arrangement will be monitored in terms of a comprehensive mechanism that comprises Quantitative Performance Criteria (QPCs), Continuous Performance Criteria (CPC) related to external arrears and Article VIII obligations, Indicative Targets (ITs), and

the monetary policy consultation clause. The QPCs that Sri Lanka is expected to achieve are the requirement to generate a primary surplus in the Government’s budget, improve the gross official reserve levels by building net international reserves, and gradually phase out Net Credit to the Government by the Central Bank. A CPC applies to the non-accumulation of new external payments arrears on external debt which will be monitored continuously by the authorities and any non-observance will be immediately reported to the IMF. In addition, another QPC includes the prohibition of imposing or intensifying restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, introducing or modifying multiple currency practices, concluding bilateral payment agreements that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, and imposing or intensifying import restrictions for BOP purposes. A monetary policy consultation clause (MPCC) has also been included to monitor year-on-year inflation on specified target dates to ensure that Sri Lanka is moving on a steady disinflation path to reach the targeted level to restore price stability. Further, ITs have been specified mainly on central government tax revenue,

social safety net spending, cost of non-commercial obligations for fuel and electricity as well as on treasury guarantees. More importantly, in order to ensure the achievement of objectives envisaged in attaining debt sustainability, the progress on the debt restructuring will be assessed at each programme review, with a view to completing debt restructuring within a reasonable time frame. The QPCs and ITs pertaining to the programme are detailed in Figure B 2.2.

External Financing Gap and Financing Sources

The programme is expected to trigger additional financing assistance with budget support from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank of US dollars 3.75 billion, of which US dollars 900 million is expected in 2023. It is also expected that with the recovery in the economy and buildup of buffers, Sri Lanka would be able to access international markets to raise funds in terms of sovereign bond issues in 2027. These resources, together with external public debt service relief, will close the external financing gap and allow Sri Lanka to rebuild its gross international reserves.

Expected Developments under the IMF-EFF Arrangement

Some of the key expected outcomes of the IMF-EFF arrangement are as follows:

• Achieving debt sustainability: To achieve debt sustainability, Sri Lanka needs to achieve specific debt financing and debt servicing related targets. Further, the debt restructuring process will be guided by quantitative targets developed under the IMF Sovereign Risk and Debt Sustainability Framework (SRDSF) in order to ensure debt reduction, manage rollover risks, avoid a renewed buildup of external pressures from debt service needs, and ensure that financing gaps during the programme period are

closed. Meeting these requirements would ensure Sri Lanka’s public debt returning to sustainable levels in the eyes of creditors and the international community, thus easing difficulties and risk premia attached to Sri Lanka’s future borrowings. The debt sustainability targets as per the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) carried out by the IMF that needs to be achieved by Sri Lanka through the debt restructuring process are as follows:

- Debt stock: Public debt to decline below 95 per cent of GDP by 2032. - Post-programme gross financing needs: Average annual gross financing needs of the central government in 2027-2032 to remain below 13 per cent of GDP. - Post-programme forex debt service: Annual forex debt service of the central government to remain below 4.5 per cent of GDP in each year over 2027-2032. - Programme financing gaps: Debt service reduction during 2023-2027 to be sufficient to close external financing gaps. • Improved fiscal performance and discipline: With the emphasis given in the programme on the fiscal front and the relevant structural benchmarks, it is expected that the Government will persist with its fiscal consolidation efforts to meet the fiscal targets through revenue enhancement measures and rationalisation of expenditure further. With constrained access to monetisation of deficits going forward, the Government is expected to make required adjustments during the available

transitory period to ensure that such requirements would not arise. In the meantime, unwarranted leakages from the fiscal revenue are addressed through the envisaged broad-based programme for SOEs.

• Legislative changes for enhanced governance and accountability framework: New pieces of legislation, such as the proposed Central Bank Act, Banking Act, and other revisions to existing legislations are expected to strengthen the institutional and regulatory framework relating to the economic management of the country. A new anti-corruption law is to be introduced harmonising the United Nations Convention against Corruption, the first such law in South Asia, providing for the creation of an independent Anti-Corruption Commission. A new Public Financial Management (PFM) law will be enacted to streamline the budget formulation process and to enhance accountability mechanism in public finance.

• Reforming social safety nets: Despite an increase in social safety nets related spending and beneficiaries in recent years, it has been identified that there is significant scope for improvement regarding the coverage and selection. Considering the issues prevailing in the existing social safety nets framework, the IMF-EFF arrangement has specified certain institutional reforms to improve efficiency, coverage, and targeting of social safety nets programmes.

• Restoring price stability: The Central Bank is expected to restore price stability by driving inflation in a steady disinflation path to bring it back to the targeted range under the Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) framework through appropriate monetary policy actions. As a part of this process, monetary financing to the Government is expected to be phased out. The price stability commitment also entails maintaining more flexibility in the exchange rate and rebuilding reserves to withstand future shocks.

• Strengthening financial institutions and financial system stability: The IMF is of the view that Sri Lanka’s financial system is heavily exposed to the public sector, moderately capitalised, and could face material capital and forex shortfalls following a debt restructuring. Consequently, there is a possibility that banks could face significant capital and forex shortfalls as a result of a sovereign debt restructuring. Therefore, plans are under way for the capital restoration of systemic banks following asset quality reviews to strengthen the resilience of the state owned banks. Meanwhile, financial sector supervision and the crisis management framework will be strengthened to make Sri Lanka’s financial system more robust.

In addition to these specific benefits, the IMF supported programme would bring several positive spillovers to the economy through improved investor confidence, possible sovereign rating upgrades, and reopening of access to markets, among others. Considering the challenging nature of the targets set out, the

authorities will have to put in a lot of effort and show commitment to ensuring the successful completion of the programme throughout the programme period. Also, in view of the maintenance of political and social stability during the programme period, especially considering the possible initial unpopularity of the reform measures and consequent public dissent, public awareness of how initial sacrifices would lead to long term economic benefits needs to be created.

Reforms Agenda Beyond the IMF-EFF Arrangement

The success of the IMF-EFF arrangement will largely rest on the extent to which the long neglected structural reforms are implemented. The structural reforms are anticipated to boost the competitiveness of the economy, provide a foundation for productivity enhancement, increase the efficiency in resource utilisation, and thereby enhance the growth potential. The severity of the current economic crisis faced by Sri Lanka highlights the importance of addressing the longstanding structural issues in a sustainable manner beyond the reforms agenda in the IMF programme through national policies which are formulated in consultation with stakeholders and free from political influences with vested interests. In this regard, the reforms agenda should focus on improving the productivity and output of the economy through technological innovations and increased economic connectivity to the world over trade and investment, by enhancing diversity in merchandise exports and potential services export sectors including tourism, IT/BPO sectors, and attracting FDI. It is also necessary to strengthen legal frameworks to ensure public accountability of state institutions, exercising available legal powers in policy formulation and implementation by relevant authorities to ensure lasting economic welfare in the country. These would complement the reforms agenda in the IMF-EFF arrangement to ensure that Sri Lanka attains and sustains macroeconomic stability in the earliest possible timeframe.

Conclusion

Despite being part of sixteen programmes since the first in 1965, only a few IMF programmes in Sri Lanka have been successfully implemented by authorities. This has been mainly due to the lack of commitment to meeting the conditionalities attached to such programmes, especially those related to structural reforms, which required painful macroeconomic adjustments and unpopular policies that were aimed at long term welfare enhancements. Therefore, it is imperative that Sri Lanka internalises these reforms in its policy formulation and implements the major areas of reforms in the current IMF programme as well as reforms beyond the programme to help the economy transform into greater stability and a higher growth path at the earliest while circumventing the need for repeated access to IMF bailouts and several rounds of debt restructuring in the future.

Fiscal Sector Developments

The Government initiated major fiscal

reforms to address fiscal sector vulnerabilities,

while taking measures to restructure public

debt aimed at ensuring debt sustainability

over the medium term. The budgetary estimates

presented in the Budget 2022 were proved

unachievable, due to low revenue collection

during the first half of 2022 and expenditure

overruns owing to high domestic interest rates

and inflation. The Government implemented an

array of fiscal consolidation measures since April

2022 and obtained Parliamentary approval for an

Interim Budget 2022 in September 2022, aimed

at strengthening revenue enhancement measures

and fiscal consolidation efforts. Supported by the

revenue enhancement measures implemented in

2022 and the elevated price level in the economy,

government revenue recorded a year-on-year

growth of 35.8 per cent to Rs. 1,979.2 billion in

2022. However, owing to the substantial increase

of nominal GDP with a large deflator, government

revenue as a percentage of GDP fell to 8.2 per

cent in 2022 from 8.3 per cent in 2021. Increased

revenue mobilisation from income taxes, Value

Added Tax (VAT), Ports and Airports Development

Levy (PAL), and excise duties on liquor and cigarettes

contributed to the nominal growth in government

tax revenue. However, revenue collection from

import duty, Special Commodity Levy (SCL), and

CESS declined during 2022, reflecting the impact

of moderation of import expenditure. Meantime,

collection from non tax revenue increased on

account of higher fees and charges, and profits

distributed by the Central Bank based on annual

financial statements of 2021. The implementation of

several revenue enhancement measures during the

second half of 2022 and in early 2023 is expected

to deliver its full impact during 2023. On the other

hand, government expenditure and net lending,

in nominal terms, increased by 27.0 per cent,

year-on-year, in 2022, despite the Government’s

expenditure rationalisation measures. However,

with the notable nominal GDP growth, government

expenditure, as a percentage of GDP, decreased

to 18.5 per cent in 2022 from 20.0 per cent in the

previous year. Higher expenditure on account of

domestic interest payments, salaries and wages,

and subsidies and transfers contributed to the

increase in recurrent expenditure. Simultaneously,

capital expenditure and net lending also registered

a year-on-year growth of 23.1 per cent, especially

on account of lending to the Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation (CPC), through the Indian Credit Line,

to import fuel, and the lending to SOE using the

funding from the World Bank to import fertiliser

and liquified petroleum (LP) gas. Accordingly, the

overall fiscal deficit in nominal terms widened to

Rs. 2,460.0 billion in 2022, from Rs. 2,057.9 billion

in the previous year. As a percentage of GDP, the

fiscal deficit declined from 11.7 per cent in 2021 to

10.2 per cent in 2022 owing to the notable growth

in nominal GDP. The current account deficit, which

reflects the dissavings of the Government, declined

from 7.3 per cent of GDP (Rs. 1,290.4 billion) in

2021 to 6.4 per cent of GDP (Rs. 1,540.4 billion)

in 2022. Meanwhile, the primary deficit narrowed

both in GDP and nominal terms, from 5.7 per cent

of GDP (Rs 1,009.5 billion) in 2021 to 3.7 per cent

of GDP (Rs. 894.8 billion) in 2022, reflecting the

impact of fiscal consolidation measures.

Restrained foreign financing, that reflected

the impact of adverse sovereign credit ratings

and the announcement of debt standstill,

compelled the Government to rely mainly on

domestic financing sources, especially the

banking sector to finance the budget deficit

during 2022. Accordingly, during 2022, net

financing through domestic sources amounted

to 82.7 per cent of the total financing (8.4 per

cent of GDP), compared to 100.7 per cent of the

total financing (11.8 per cent of GDP) in 2021.

The Central Bank continued to be the largest

financing source to the Government, recording a

net financing of Rs. 1,338.4 billion in 2022, owing

to its direct subscription at Treasury bills auctions,

amidst subdued market appetite for government

securities, and direct issuances of Treasury bills to

the Central Bank. Net foreign financing amounted

to Rs. 424.8 billion (1.8 per cent of GDP) during

2022 due to the receipt of multilateral and bilateral

funding for lessening the hardships of the public

caused by the economic crisis. In 2021, foreign

financing recorded a net repayment of Rs. 13.9

billion (0.1 per cent of GDP). Meanwhile, with

the Parliamentary approval, the limit of Treasury

bills stock was increased from Rs. 3,000 billion to

Rs. 4,000 billion in June 2022, and in view of the

rising borrowing requirement in face value terms

due to high market interest rates, this limit was

further raised to Rs. 5,000 billion in November 2022.

The outstanding central government debt

increased from Rs. 17,614.2 billion (100.1

per cent of GDP) by end 2021 to Rs. 27,492.0

billion (113.8 per cent of GDP) by end 2022. This

reflected the impact of a large budget deficit, parity

loss due to the sharp depreciation of the exchange

rate, and reclassification of selected debt liabilities

under central government debt that were previously

recorded under State Owned Business Enterprises

(SOBE). In nominal terms, domestic debt and

foreign debt increased by 35.5 per cent and 91.2

per cent, respectively, by end 2022. While the

share of Treasury bonds continued to dominate the

composition of domestic debt stock with a share of

57.9 per cent by end 2022, compared to 62.8 per

cent by end 2021, less market appetite for longer

tenure government securities and speculation

over the possibility of domestic debt restructuring

resulted in a substantial increase in the stock of

Treasury bills to Rs. 4,113.9 billion by end 2022.

Increased gross financing needs and large

foreign debt service obligations that are due in

the near and medium term amidst critically low

gross official reserves and inadequate foreign

financing flows compelled the Government

to suspend debt servicing of bilateral and

commercial external debt and announce a

debt standstill as an interim policy on 12 April

2022, pending debt restructuring efforts. As a

result, foreign debt service payments declined to

Rs. 487.4 billion (2.0 per cent of GDP) in 2022, in

comparison to the Rs. 786.3 billion (4.5 per cent of

GDP) foreign debt service payments made in the

preceding year. Domestic debt service payments

increased to Rs. 2,510.3 billion (10.4 per cent of

GDP) in 2022, compared to Rs. 1,594.3 billion

(9.1 per cent of GDP) in 2021, primarily due to

the sharp increase in domestic interest rates and

the increase in domestic debt during the period

under review. Accordingly, the total debt service

payments increased from Rs. 2,380.6 billion in

2021 (13.5 per cent of GDP) to Rs. 2,997.6 billion

(12.4 per cent of GDP) in 2022. During the period

under review, interest payments and capital

repayments amounted to 6.5 per cent and 5.9

per cent of GDP, respectively. The Government

shared more information on domestic debt

optimisation perimeters in late March 2023 in order

to assuage concerns associated with domestic

debt restructuring, which dampened sentiments

in the government securities market. The overall

debt restructuring strategy of the Government is

expected to be announced to creditors in the near

term, thereby expediting the debt restructuring

process along the debt sustainability targets

envisaged in the IMF-EFF arrangement.

Monetary Sector Developments

The Central Bank continued the tight

monetary policy stance throughout 2022 with a

significant increase in policy interest rates of 700

basis points in April 2022. Such large monetary

policy tightening was necessitated to contain rising

inflationary pressures, address vulnerabilities in the

external sector and anchor inflation expectations,

thereby preventing possible hyperinflation and

prolonged loss of economic activity. Accordingly,

since the monetary tightening cycle that began in

August 2021, the Central Bank’s key policy interest

rates, i.e., the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR)

and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR), were

raised by 10 percentage points by end 2022. The

unprecedented upward adjustment of policy interest

rates by 700 basis points in April 2022 helped arrest

the further build-up of demand driven inflationary

pressures, thereby preempting the escalation of

adverse inflationary expectations, easing the pressure

on the external sector, and correcting anomalies

observed in the market interest rate structure. In

addition, regulatory measures, including the removal

of maximum interest rates imposed on selected

lending products, and foreign currency deposits were

also taken by the Central Bank, enabling the effective

passthrough of policy interest rate changes to tighten

monetary conditions. Meanwhile, liquidity levels in

the domestic money market continued to remain at

high deficit levels, particularly during the first half of

2022, due to foreign exchange sales by the Central

Bank for facilitating imports of essentials, net foreign

loan repayments of the Government, net currency

withdrawals by the public from the banking system,

and maturities of foreign currency buy-sell swaps with

domestic banks. However, reflecting the impact of the

primary purchases of government securities by the

Central Bank and an increase in currency deposits

to the banking system with high deposit interest

rates, amidst the conduct of long term reverse repo

auctions on a need basis, a gradual improvement in

the domestic money market liquidity was observed

towards the latter part of 2022. Due to the combined

impact of a faster passthrough of the increase in policy

interest rates, tight liquidity conditions in the domestic

money market and elevated risk premia, market

deposit and lending interest rates rose significantly

in 2022. Subsequent to the sharp increase in key

policy interest rates, amidst the increased borrowing

requirement of the Government and heightened

uncertainty in market conditions surrounding

domestic debt restructuring concerns, the yields

on government securities increased significantly

during 2022, disproportionate to the adjustment in

policy interest rates and other market interest rates.

Moreover, while providing liquidity to banks through

open market operations on need basis, measures

were introduced in January 2023 to reduce the

Licensed Commercial Banks’ (LCBs) over-reliance

on the Central Bank’s standing facilities, thereby

reducing asymmetries in the distribution of liquidity in

the domestic money market. Consequently, overnight

liquidity in the domestic money market and activity in

the interbank call and repo markets improved. Along

with improved rupee liquidity conditions and the

improvement in investor sentiment in anticipation

of the successful finalisation of the IMF-EFF

arrangement, a notable moderation in yields on

government securities was observed towards the

end of 2022 and early 2023. Other market interest

rates also started to ease gradually from late 2022,

correcting the disorderly upward adjustment in the

market interest rates. However, given the necessity of

fulfilling all the ‘prior actions’ in order to move forward

with the finalisation of the IMF-EFF arrangement, and

concerns raised by the IMF staff about the need to

further tighten policy interest rates, the Central Bank

and the IMF staff reached a consensus and raised

policy interest rates by 100 basis points in early

March 2023, compared to a larger upward adjustment

proposed by the IMF during the finalisation of the

staff level agreement in September 2022. With this

policy action, the Central Bank communicated to the

market the need to lower the spread between policy

interest rates and high market interest rates, while

underscoring the possible downward adjustment in

risk premia, as more information becomes available

on domestic restructuring perimeters. The market

interest rate movements continued to decline,

narrowing the spread between the policy interest

rates and other market interest rates as anticipated.

Meanwhile, the Government shared more information

on the domestic debt optimisation perimeters in late

March 2023, which led to a notable adjustment in the

Treasury bill yields, subsequently.

The growth of broad money supply (M2b),

which accelerated notably in early 2022,

amidst the substantial expansion of credit to

the public sector and the revaluation effects of

foreign currency denominated domestic credit,

decelerated thereafter, largely on account of

the contraction of credit to the private sector.

By end 2022, the year-on-year growth of M2b was

recorded at 15.4 per cent, and once adjusted for

the impact of the rupee depreciation,1 the same is

estimated to have decelerated to around 7 per cent

by end 2022 from 13.2 per cent at end 2021.

Although outstanding credit to the private sector

by LCBs increased notably, in rupee terms, during

early 2022 mainly on account of the revaluation

effects of foreign currency denominated loans and

advances amidst the substantial depreciation of the

rupee, credit extended to the private sector by LCBs

continued to contract from mid-2022 in response to

the tight monetary conditions and the moderation

in economic activity. Accordingly, by end 2022,

the year-on-year growth of credit extended to

the private sector decelerated to 6.2 per cent (an

estimated contraction of 3.3 per cent, year-on-year,

after adjusting for the depreciation of the rupee2).

1 Under this scenario, the growth of money supply is estimated by valuing all foreign currency denominated balances using the exchange rate that prevailed at end February 2022.

2 Under this scenario, the growth of credit to the private sector is estimated by valuing all foreign currency denominated credit using the exchange rate that prevailed at end February 2022.

Nevertheless, reflecting the continued reliance of

the Government on domestic financing, particularly

on the Central Bank, Net Credit to the Government

(NCG) by the banking system expanded notably

during 2022 amidst low government revenue and

limited access to foreign financing sources. Further

to the expansion of Rs. 1,284.4 billion in 2021, NCG

by the banking system increased significantly by

Rs. 1,638.7 billion during 2022, with NCG by the

Central Bank contributing the most towards this

expansion. Credit obtained by the SOBEs from

the banking system also expanded considerably,

reflecting their weak financial performance and the

revaluation effects of foreign currency denominated

debt. Meanwhile, net foreign assets (NFA) of the

banking system contracted significantly during 2022,

driven by the decline in NFA of the Central Bank as

official reserves were utilised for debt repayments

in early 2022 and to finance imports of essentials

throughout the year, due to the limited availability of

foreign exchange liquidity in the market. However,

a marginal improvement in NFA of the Central

Bank was observed in late 2022. Moreover, NFA of

LCBs recorded an improvement in 2022, particularly

during the latter part of the year.

Financial Sector Developments

Amidst multifaceted headwinds from the

prevailing economic crisis, the stability of the

financial system was preserved during 2022.

Sovereign rating downgrades, high sovereign

exposure of the banking sector, economic

contraction, acute foreign exchange shortage

and high level of inflation, along with the

announcement of the standstill on external debt

servicing on account of bilateral and commercial

debt by the Government in April 2022 created a

significant and unprecedented adverse impact on

the activities of the financial sector. Nevertheless,

prudent regulatory measures along with regulatory

forbearances facilitated the preservation of

financial system stability during the year. The

stability of the banking sector was maintained

during 2022, despite the looming challenges

arising from continuously declining credit quality,

acute pressure on liquidity, low level of profitability

due to high impairments, and deteriorating capital

buffers. The Licensed Finance Companies (LFCs)

and Specialised Leasing Companies (SLCs)

sector managed to continue its expansion

during 2022 in terms of assets and deposits with

adequate capital and liquidity buffers, amidst

challenges stemming from the contraction of

credit growth, declining profitability and increase

loans. Meanwhile, the insurance sector reported

a modest growth in terms of the asset base and

Gross Written Premium (GWP), with a decline

in insurance penetration during 2022. Primary

Dealer Companies, Licensed Microfinance

Companies, Superannuation Funds and other

subsectors demonstrated a mixed performance

during the period, mainly owing to headwinds from

the economic crisis.

Financial markets also managed to

withstand pressures from multiple fronts

during 2022 and showed signs of revival from

late 2022. Money market liquidity, which remained

at a persistently high level of deficit during the

first half of 2022, improved considerably by end

2022, mainly due to the measures taken by the

Central Bank. Meanwhile, money market activities

recorded a lacklustre performance with the

continuous reliance of the participatory institutions

on the standing facilities provided by the Central

Bank to borrow funds or deposit excess funds and

increased risk aversion among participants. The

measures adopted by the Central Bank to limit

the reliance on standing facilities from early 2023

helped activate the interbank call money market

and repo market to a large extent. The domestic

foreign exchange market experienced strained

liquidity conditions with a large depreciation of

the exchange rate due to BOP stresses and

unfavourable market sentiments during 2022,

while improvements were witnessed from early

2023, with measures to remove daily market

guidance on the exchange rates and mandatory

sales requirements of foreign exchange to the

Central Bank, along with the positive market

sentiments following the finalisation of the IMF-

EFF arrangement. The equity market recorded

a dismal performance during 2022, reflecting

the high yield for fixed-income securities and

negative market sentiments against the backdrop

of prevailing adverse macroeconomic conditions.

However, the equity market registered net foreign

inflows during the year. Financial infrastructure

continued to support the functioning of the

financial sector under the challenging economic

environment.

1.3 Global Economic Environment and Outlook

Global economic activity is estimated to have

decelerated sharply in 2022 due to synchronous

policy tightening by central banks globally, aimed

at containing elevated inflation, stemming from

the Russia-Ukraine war and a resurgence of

COVID-19 in China. According to the World

Economic Outlook (WEO) update of the IMF released

in January 2023, global economic growth is forecast at

3.4 per cent in 2022, a significant decline, compared to

the 6.2 per cent growth estimated for 2021. Economic

conditions deteriorated substantially in advanced

economies in 2022 as high inflation eroded household

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

purchasing power and dented confidence, while rapid

monetary policy tightening weighed on demand. The

Russia-Ukraine war resulted in severe energy supply

disruptions in the euro area, pushing up energy prices

and prices of some food items, thereby hampering

production and consumption and fuelling uncertainty.

Economic activity in China slowed in 2022 amidst

large and repeated COVID-19 outbreaks and

accompanying lockdowns. Furthermore, activity

in emerging market and developing economies

decelerated sharply in 2022, due to tight global

financial conditions, reduced consumer spending

amidst high inflation, dampened external demand,

and spillovers from the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

Tightening financial conditions amidst

the global fight against inflation and the

continuation of the Russia-Ukraine war are

expected to impact global economic activity

in 2023, while reopening of China is expected

to partially offset this impact. As per the WEO

update of January 2023, global growth is projected

to fall to 2.9 per cent in 2023 and thereafter record

an upturn of 3.1 per cent in 2024. Growth in

advanced economies is predicted to fall drastically

from 2.7 per cent in 2022 to 1.2 per cent in 2023.

A majority of advanced economies, including the

United States (US), the Eurozone economies and

the United Kingdom, are forecast to experience

slower growth rates in 2023. However, growth

in advanced economies is expected to pick up

modestly in 2024, as headwinds due to tighter

monetary policy subside and energy markets

stabilise. Subdued economic activity in advanced

economies could have an impact on Sri Lanka’s

exports, as low external demand could result in

reduced exports of major items, mainly textiles and

garments. As the US and the European Union serve

as the largest export destinations for Sri Lanka, any

reduction in demand from these regions would have

a sizeable negative impact on export performance,

thereby affecting economic growth. Furthermore,

a lower growth in income levels in advanced

economies could mean a reduction in global

tourist movements originating from such nations.

Meanwhile, economic activity in emerging market

and developing economies is projected to increase

marginally from 3.9 per cent in 2022 to 4.0 per

cent in 2023, mainly due to the anticipated growth

rates in emerging and developing Asia, particularly

in China, and a higher growth rate projected for

Russia. However, in around half of emerging

market and developing economies, the economic

growth in 2023 is projected to be lower than it was

in 2022. In addition to tightening financial conditions

and geopolitical tensions, emerging market and

developing economies contend with diverse

headwinds, including spillovers from subdued

demand conditions in advanced economies and

continued fiscal consolidation measures. The

expected pick-up in economic activity in China and

the resilience in economic growth in India could

be beneficial to Sri Lanka, as Sri Lanka has had

longstanding economic linkages with both nations

in areas such as tourism and foreign investment,

particularly in construction related sectors.

Global inflation is estimated to have

peaked in 2022 and projected to be easing in

2023 amidst weakening demand and easing

commodity prices. Consumer prices in the world,

according to the WEO update of January 2023,

rose by 8.8 per cent in 2022, compared to 4.7 per

cent in 2021. Soaring inflation in 2022 reflected

a combination of demand and supply factors,

where on the demand side, the lagged effects of

ultra easy monetary and fiscal support following the

pandemic contributed to persistent price pressures.

With respect to the supply side, shortages of key

commodities, exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine

war, along with capacity constraints and supply

chain disruptions contributed substantially to

28

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

1

higher prices. However, in the light of substantial

monetary tightening, slowing activity, easing supply

chain disruptions, and moderating prices of energy

and other commodities, inflation is projected to

decline in the period ahead. Accordingly, global

inflation is expected to decline to 6.6 per cent in

2023 and to 4.3 per cent in 2024. Nonetheless,

the forecast levels of inflation are still higher than

the pre-pandemic levels of around 3.5 per cent.

Moderating global energy and other commodity

prices would be beneficial for Sri Lanka, as the

contribution of these global prices on domestic

price increases in 2022 was notably high. If the

envisaged moderation in global prices is passed

on to domestic prices via timely and transparent

adjustments, imported inflation could be kept at a

considerably low level, supporting the anticipated

disinflation process in the country.

Many central banks around the world started

raising their key policy rates during 2022,

gradually rolling back pandemic related stimuli,

in view of rising inflationary pressures and

unfavourable inflation expectations. Inflation has

risen faster and more persistently than expected

since 2021. In 2022, inflation in advanced economies

reached its highest rate since 1982. Rising price

pressures have triggered synchronised monetary

policy tightening across advanced economies and

most emerging market and developing economies.

The Federal Reserve of the US, which had held

the federal funds rate at around zero during the

COVID-19 pandemic, raised the federal funds

target rate significantly by 425 basis points in 2022,

followed by a 50 basis point increase thus far in

2023. In addition, the Federal Reserve continued to

reduce its holdings of Treasury securities, agency

debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities in

a move to unwind the accommodative financial

conditions created in response to the pandemic.

Similarly, the Bank of England (BoE) has increased

the bank rate by a total of 325 basis points in 2022

and by 75 basis points so far in 2023, recording the

highest level since late 2008, despite projecting

weak economic growth. The European Central

Bank (ECB) also implemented a steady increase

in its policy interest rates from a level of zero in

2022 to 3.5 per cent by March 2023. Further, the

ECB announced a reduction in its holdings of

securities under the Eurosystem’s asset purchase

programme. Further, major advanced economies

provided forward guidance on the anticipated path

and the continuing tighter monetary conditions in

2023 and most of 2024. Real economic activity and

financial markets have responded to the tightening of

monetary conditions as the interest rates have risen

across the yield curve in many countries, while the

momentum in labour markets has been slowing and

the housing markets are showing signs of cooling.

However, tighter monetary policy in advanced

economies could weigh on capital flows to emerging

market and developing economies, including

Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, central banks in most

emerging market and developing economies also

adopted restrictive policies in 2022 to fight against

rising inflationary pressures. Accordingly, the

Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Bank Negara

Malaysia (BNM), the Bank of Thailand (BoT), the

Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), and Bank

Indonesia (BI), among others, increased their

benchmark policy interest rates in 2022, as well as

in early 2023, to control inflation. In contrast, the

People’s Bank of China (PBoC) continued to relax

monetary policy in 2022 in an attempt to revive

the economy affected by extended COVID-19

lockdowns and issues in the real estate sector.

Amidst heightened interest rates, particularly

the high yields on government securities, the

banking sector in advanced economies showed

signs of financial distress. In March 2023, the

Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in the US collapsed,

29

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

recording the second largest bank failure in the

US history and the biggest bank failure since

the global financial crisis in 2008. As the Federal

Reserve raised interest rates sharply in 2022 to

curb rising inflation, the market value of the US

Treasury securities declined substantially. Since

many banks had investments in the US Treasury

securities, the decline in market value caused

losses in their investment portfolio, depleting

capital reserves and weakening their balance

sheets. The lending portfolio of SVB was heavily

biased towards Fintech companies and startups,

thus raising its concentrated risk. Several other US

banks, including First Republic, which was rescued

by a collective of large US banks, also witnessed

financial distress due to the same phenomenon. In

addition, Silvergate Bank of the US also failed in

March 2023, on account of its increased exposure

to cryptocurrency related firms, while the operations

of Signature Bank in the US have been suspended

by the regulators for the same reason. In response

to these failures, the Federal Reserve of the US

and the US government agencies announced

a series of measures to ensure the availability

of liquidity to banks in financial distress and to

honour deposits of failed banks. Apart from the

US banking sector, Credit Suisse (CS), a global

investment bank and financial services firm based

in Switzerland, showed signs of financial distress in

March 2023. However, its collapse was averted by

an emergency loan facility provided by the Swiss

National Bank to shore up finances. CS was later

taken over by UBS, the largest banking institution

in Switzerland, a deal which was fast tracked by the

Swiss National Bank and the Swiss government.

Moreover, the ongoing banking crisis has triggered

market panic in advanced economies and resulted

in significant losses in the share values of the US

and European banking sectors. Meanwhile, the US

Federal Reserve, the Bank of Canada, BoE, the

Bank of Japan, ECB, and the Swiss National Bank

announced a collaborative action later in March

2023, to enhance the provision of liquidity via the

standing US dollar liquidity swap line arrangements

to stem liquidity concerns in the global financial

system and ensure smooth cross border settlements.

Nonetheless, the current distress in global banking

institutions and the consequent contagion effects

could become a source of significant downside risk

to the economic outlook, and its spillovers could

also impact the emerging market and developing

economies. Moreover, this financial turmoil could

lead to a deviation from anticipated tighter financial

conditions globally, as this could make major central

banks to rethink their policy direction or the pace

of any future policy rate adjustments. Meanwhile,

large scale liquidity provision to address financial

distress could resume demand pressures going

forward, threatening largely believed disinflation

trends across the world.

Risks to the global economic outlook, on

an aggregate basis, indicate possible lower

than expected global growth and higher than

expected inflation. On the upside, pent-up

demand, supported by the stock of surplus private

savings, particularly from the pandemic related

fiscal aid, as well as extremely tight labour markets

and strong wage growth, leaves scope for an

increase in consumption. Furthermore, faster

disinflation on account of an easing in labour

market conditions in advanced economies, cooling

wage inflation, and a sharp decline in the prices

of goods is another possible favourable outcome.

However, many downside risks could affect the

global outlook in 2023. A slow recovery in China

amidst the prolonged effects of the COVID-19

pandemic and the deepening real estate crisis

could have spillovers to the rest of the world in

terms of lower demand and supply chain issues.

The Russia-Ukraine crisis remains a major source

of risk, particularly for Europe and lower-income

30

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

1

nations, as a further escalation in the war could lead

to a possible spike in energy and food prices. An

increasing number of countries are currently either

in debt distress or at high risk of such distress.

This, together with lower growth and higher

borrowing costs, could aggravate the vulnerabilities

of these economies, affecting the global outlook.

Meanwhile, due to the persistent tightness of the

job market and higher than predicted prices for

food and energy as a result of the war in Ukraine or

a speedier rebound in China's economy, inflation

could once again soar and persist at elevated levels,

de-anchoring inflation expectations. Furthermore,

any premature easing of financial conditions and

the associated increase in financial market volatility

and geopolitical fragmentation remain other

downside risks to the global outlook. In addition,

the ongoing distress in the global banking system

and the possible spillover effects could become a

major source of downside risks to the global growth

outlook and financial conditions.

1.4 Macroeconomic Outlook3

The medium term outlook of the Sri Lankan

economy depends heavily on the timely and

effective fulfilment of performance criteria and

structural benchmarks and reforms envisaged

in the macroeconomic adjustment programme

outlined in the IMF-EFF arrangement. Effective

implementation of reforms in a timely and consistent

manner would be essential to create a conducive

business environment in the period ahead.

Further, the realisation of the baseline scenario of

the macroeconomic outlook could be subject to

unanticipated external and domestic shocks. The

medium term macroeconomic outlook that has

3 The Medium term macroeconomic framework presented in this section is based on the policy scenario with the assumption of successful continuation of the IMF-EFF supported programme, including the completion of the debt restructuring process before end of September 2023, thereby unlocking further assistance from international financial institutions. It is pertinent to mention that there could be differences in the medium term macroeconomic projections published by the international financial institutions for Sri Lanka based on information available at different timelines and underlying assumptions.

been published by the Central Bank in the past had

assumed the implementation of necessary reforms

to remedy the structural impediments. However, the

failure in implementing the required reforms delayed

the realisation of the benign macroeconomic outlook

envisaged in the past. As Sri Lanka has reached

crossroads in its post-independence economic

journey, there is some reasonable expectation at

present that policy commitment to implementing

long overdue reforms and public support for such

decisive reforms will prevail in the ensuing period.

Nevertheless, the envisaged medium term path

is fraught with uncertainties due to possible risks

associated with the timing of completion of the

ongoing debt restructuring negotiations, the pace

and magnitude of the post-restructuring economic

recovery, the successful completion of the IMF-EFF

supported programme targets, etc. The progress

of the reforms implemented thus far is notable. The

resolve of policymakers to continue the reforms

agenda in the period ahead, and the understanding

of the public of the need to pursue painful reforms

are imperative to ensure a sustained stability in the

medium to long term.

The Sri Lankan economy is poised to recover

gradually from its deepest economic contraction

witnessed in 2022. This recovery would be buoyed

by the macroeconomic adjustment programme

under the IMF-EFF arrangement, which is aimed at

restoring macroeconomic stability, debt sustainability,

safeguarding financial system stability, strengthening

governance and unlocking the growth potentials

of the economy, while also alleviating the adverse

impact of the economic crisis on the poor and

vulnerable segments of the population. Meanwhile,

the frontloaded stabilisation measures adopted by

the Government and the Central Bank helped contain

demand pressures, and rein in spiralling inflation and

exchange rate depreciation, thereby forestalling further

31

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

deterioration of the economy. These improvements,

coupled with the domestic supply side developments

and easing foreign exchange liquidity pressures, are

expected to provide a strong impetus for the near term

recovery in economic activity. However, the tightened

monetary and fiscal policies and the BOP constraints

could slow the pace of recovery in 2023. The economy

is likely to face global headwinds, stemming from

broad-based slowdown in global economic growth

in 2023 and burgeoning financial market distress,

which could impede the country’s trade potential and

discourage prospective foreign exchange inflows

and foreign investment. Nevertheless, the improved

sentiments following the approval of the IMF-EFF

arrangement in March 2023 and the ongoing debt

restructuring efforts, and the resultant stabilisation of

macroeconomic conditions, are expected to support

the recovery in momentum from late 2023. The growth

trajectory on an elevated potential in the medium term

is expected to be contoured by instituting the planned

growth enhancement strategies stipulated under the

IMF-EFF arrangement. Moreover, the implementation

of targeted revenue-based fiscal consolidation strategy

coupled with the institutional reforms of SOBEs

and execution of cost recovery pricing mechanisms

for provisioning of public utilities are expected to

foster fiscal consolidation and bolster economic

stability in the period ahead. Further, restoration of

debt sustainability through a comprehensive debt

restructuring process is expected to create space for

foreign financing opportunities once sovereign ratings

are improved, while the substantial financing support

expected from the international financial institutions

will help strengthen investor confidence in the period

ahead. The projected stabilisation of inflation is likely

to create a conducive environment for investments

over the medium term, while greater flexibility in

the exchange rate is also expected to spur stability

in the external sector and trade competitiveness of

the economy in the ensuing period. However, lower

than expected external demand and the continuation

of global supply chain issues could pose a risk of

delayed normalisation of economic activities in

Sri Lanka. Strengthening social safety nets, by

improving efficiency and adequate budgetary

allocations, is expected to build resilience and enable

individuals to seize opportunities for economic

empowerment and sustainable development,

promoting inclusive growth in the medium term.

While the recovery and growth of the economy

are contingent upon the resolute commitment of

the policymakers spearheading the Government

to institute long overdue structural reforms, policy

continuity and certainty remain critical to pave the way

for harnessing the economy’s potential and facilitating

the sustainable and equitable distribution of benefits

of growth across all segments of the population.

Inflation is expected to stabilise at the targeted

levels over the medium term, following the rapid

disinflation in 2023, supported by subdued

aggregate demand, owing to tight monetary

and fiscal policies, abating supply disruptions

both globally and domestically, along with the

favourable statistical base effect. Large monetary

tightening, implemented by the Central Bank, would

contain the growth of credit to the private sector,

thereby restraining demand pressures, while the

substantial revenue-based fiscal consolidation

measures undertaken by the Government may

lead to a considerable reduction of the spending

power of the public in the near future. Meanwhile,

the improved availability of fertiliser and fuel would

contribute to easing supply-related constraints. The

strengthening of the Sri Lanka rupee, if persists, could

also contribute to lower price pressures in the near

term. These factors, together with the favourable

statistical base effect, are expected to contribute to

lowering inflation significantly over the short term.

Although the second round impacts of the recent

electricity tariff revisions could affect the disinflation

process, the low spending power of the public and the

formula-based downward revision of fuel and

gas prices could work to offset such inflationary

pressures to a large extent. With the support of

funding from the IMF and other multilateral agencies,

along with the successful implementation of the debt

restructuring process, the country would be able

to gradually relax the prevailing import restrictions

prioritising essential needs, thereby further easing

supply bottlenecks. However, possible depreciation

pressure on the exchange rate after such relaxation

may need to be carefully managed as it could

affect the general price level swiftly. Meanwhile,

the expected enactment of the proposed Central

Bank Act would allow more independence to the

Central Bank, limiting monetary financing, and

thereby strengthening policies targeted at managing

inflation and inflation expectations. The global

supply conditions are also anticipated to normalise

over the medium term, though the direction and the

impact of the recent financial turmoil and the ongoing

Russia-Ukraine war remain largely uncertain. Any

possible increase in global food and energy prices

has the possibility of slowing down the disinflation

process in Sri Lanka. Most major central banks in

the world are expected to maintain tight monetary

conditions throughout 2023 and possibly in early

2024 to arrest inflationary pressures, although the

volatilities in global financial conditions could affect

the conduct of global monetary policy to some extent.

The Central Bank remains committed to bringing

down the prevailing high inflation towards single

digit levels by late 2023. However, the successful

continuation of the IMF-EFF supported programme,

along with efforts to sustainably strengthen the fiscal

33

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

and external buffers, and the implementation of the

proposed structural reforms to improve the economic

potential, remain instrumental to ensuring economic

and price stability over the medium term.

Monetary policy will remain focused on ensuring

price stability over the medium term, while giving

due regard to stabilising economic growth towards

its potential, under a flexible inflation targeting (FIT)

policy framework. Yields on government securities,

particularly Treasury bills, and the market interest rates

applicable on both deposit and lending products are

expected to moderate in the period ahead, supported

by the favourable inflation outlook, improving domestic

money market liquidity conditions and the reduction

in the risk premia attached to government securities,

as the uncertainty on the domestic debt restructuring

concerns has been largely cleared after the public

announcement on 30 March 2023 on domestic debt

optimisation, pending the announcement on the overall

debt restructuring strategy of the Government in the

near term. Nonetheless, monetary conditions would

remain reasonably tight until inflationary pressures

are sufficiently and credibly contained, and inflation

expectations are anchored in line with the inflation

objective of the Central Bank. With deposit interest

rates reducing from their peak levels, the growth of

deposits mobilised by the banking sector is expected

to remain subdued in the period ahead. Meanwhile,

relatively high market lending interest rates are

expected to contain the growth of credit to the private

sector, resulting in a contraction in its overall stock in the

near term. However, with the expected normalisation

of interest rates, the gradual recovery in economic

activity and the improvements in business sentiments,

credit to the private sector is envisaged to expand from

late 2023. Meanwhile, the envisaged fiscal reforms

and the anticipated receipt of foreign financing by the

Government are expected to reduce the Government’s

reliance on financing from the banking sector, especially

monetary financing in the period ahead. In addition, the

planned structural reforms in SOBEs, along with the

productivity improvements, are expected to gradually

reduce their reliance on the Government’s budget as

well as the banking sector. Accordingly, the expansion

of net domestic assets (NDA) of the banking system

is expected to be benign in the period ahead. Driven

by the efforts of the Central Bank to gradually rebuild

its external reserves and enhancements of external

asset positions of LCBs (net of liabilities), the NFA

position of the banking system is expected to improve

in the forthcoming period. Going forward, the conduct

of monetary policy will continue to be based on a

forward-looking and data-driven approach, supported

by recent and expected macroeconomic developments

and projections, both domestic and global. Timely

adjustments to policies and strategies of the Central

Bank will be made under the FIT framework, as and

when new information becomes available. Restoration

of price stability and maintenance of inflation at a

low and stable level thereafter would eliminate large

volatilities of interest rates, thus creating an enabling

environment for business planning and investments

to support economic growth. With the expected

enactment of the Central Bank Act, the independence

and accountability of the Central Bank will be further

strengthened, thereby reinforcing its prime objective of

ensuring price stability. Meanwhile, the Central Bank

will continue to engage with the public via effective

and transparent communication on current economic

conditions and the outlook. The Central Bank will also

start publishing a forward looking Monetary Policy

Report to better inform the public on the outlook of the

economy, thereby further improving the transparency

on monetary policy actions.

The external sector outlook for 2023 and

beyond will largely depend on the progress of

debt restructuring, continuation of the IMF-EFF

supported programme, and global economic

and financial outlook. The trade deficit is likely to

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

1Background

The Monetary Law Act (MLA), No. 58 of 1949 established the Central Bank of Ceylon in 1950 (it was renamed the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in 1985) with multiple objectives focusing on both stabilisation and development. The MLA was drafted based on the recommendations of the Exter Report.1 However, considering the difficulties in achieving inconsistent multiple objectives and in keeping with the trends in central banking, the Central Bank embarked on a modernisation programme in the early 2000s. Accordingly, the objectives were streamlined to two core objectives, namely, the maintenance of economic and price stability and financial system stability.

The Need for a New Central Bank Act

The MLA has not been comprehensively reviewed and revised in the past 74 years, except for the amendment in 2002 mentioned above, which mainly streamlined the objectives of the Central Bank. Hence, several provisions of the MLA, amidst economic developments and the evolution of central banking in general, necessitated reassessment and amendments in line with the international best practices. This paved the way for the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act (CBA) to be drafted to include provisions strengthening the Central Bank independence, enhancing transparency and accountability and strengthening the monetary policy framework to ensure sustained price stability in Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, the CBA is also expected to strengthen the financial sector and macroprudential oversight and improve the governance of the Central Bank. The amendments to the MLA and subsequent CBA are expected to be in line with international best practices in central banking and address shortcomings of the MLA as well.

BOX 3Highlights of 'the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act'

Key Highlights of the Central Bank Act

The CBA bears several important amendments compared to the MLA, in several areas, mainly the objectives of the Central Bank and monetary policy framework, its governance and organisational structure recognising the Central Bank as the macroprudential authority, and the Central Bank’s accountability to the Parliament, the Government, and the public.

Domestic Price Stability as the Primary Objective

As opposed to the two equally weighted objectives mentioned in the MLA, the CBA gives prominence to achieving and maintaining domestic price stability. This ensures that the Central Bank will be committed to delivering low and stable inflation in the future. Experiences have shown that the economy performs well when inflation is low and is expected to be low. Low and stable inflation helps to keep stable levels of interest rates. Such an environment allows an economy to achieve its growth potential. Further, in pursuing the primary objective, the Central Bank shall take into account the stabilisation of output towards its potential level. These arrangements are in accordance with the Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) framework that aims at stabilising inflation around the inflation target while minimising disturbance to the real economy. Further, on a rare occasion where the attention of both price stability and financial system stability is required, and the policy decision concerning either side is subject to a tradeoff, the Central Bank is expected to prioritise its primary object of price stability.

Governance Structure

Under the MLA, the Monetary Board is entrusted with making monetary policy decisions along with other policy and operational decisions. However, under the CBA, the powers are vested with two parallel decision making bodies, namely the Governing Board (GB) and the Monetary Policy Board (MPB), where the latter is entrusted with the responsibility of formulating and

implementing the FIT framework along with the flexible exchange rate regime to achieve domestic price stability, while the former is charged with the responsibility of determining the general policy of the Central Bank other than monetary policy.

As per the CBA, the Secretary to the Treasury (ST) is no longer a member of any of the decision making bodies of the Central Bank. However, in order to ensure greater fiscal-monetary-financial stability policy coordination, a Coordination Council will be instituted and ST will be a member of the Coordination Council. The separation of the MPB from the GB that oversees other functions and formulates financial sector and other policies of the Central Bank, and technical representation of the Board with two internal members (Deputy Governors) and external experts facilitates efficient formulation of monetary policy. It is an accepted international practice to have an MPB with both external and internal members with the required knowledge and expertise on monetary policy formulation. Also, having a dedicated decision making body to achieve the primary objective provides space for the members to get engaged in detailed policy deliberations at early stages, thereby strengthening monetary policy formulation.

Improved Central Bank Autonomy and Accountability

The provisions of the CBA were put forward with the broader view of strengthening the autonomy and accountability of the Central Bank in its policy and operational decision making. The CBA has explicit provisions ensuring administrative and financial autonomy, which would emphasise more operational independence in policymaking at the Central Bank. Further, external influences on the Governor, appointed Members to the GB, MPB, and employees are categorically prohibited under the CBA.

In order to ensure autonomy in monetary policymaking, the CBA ensures no government representation in the Central Bank’s decision making bodies in any form. However, the Coordination Council is expected to facilitate information sharing and the exchange of views on events posing significant risks to financial stability or economic activity. Meantime, the Central Bank will remain as the financial advisor, fiscal agent, and banker to the Government. However, the fiscal dominance on monetary policymaking, the major impediment on monetary policy in the past, has been avoided by restricting monetary financing of the fiscal deficit and a check on provisional advances to the Government, which is essential for the success of FIT. Accordingly, the Central Bank is restricted from granting direct or indirect credits to the Government, to any government owned entity, or to any other public entity, not incur costs on behalf of the Government except for expenses related to the Central Bank’s functions, and not purchase securities issued by the Government, by any government owned entity, or any

other public entity in the primary market.2 However, the CBA allows the granting of provisional advances to the Government to finance expenditures at the beginning of the year,3 subject to several restrictions to limit new direct credits to the Government. The outstanding amount of such provisional advances granted shall not exceed ten per cent of the revenue of the first four months of the preceding financial year and will have to be remunerated at market related interest rates.

Meanwhile, providing required independence for operational and financial independence, the CBA ensures a greater accountability of the Central Bank to the Parliament and the public with regard to its policies, outcomes, and failures. Checks and balances, which create a separation of powers and ensure that no authority control too much power, are important to improve independent decision making, ensure accountability, and maintain public confidence. Thus, the CBA includes provisions aiming at improving accountability through statutory public disclosure requirements, periodic submissions of reports to the Parliament and the arrangement that the Governor to be heard by the Parliament or by any of its committees, periodically. In this regard, the Central Bank is expected to submit several reports to the Parliament and public on the implementation of monetary policy and achievement of the Central Bank objects, specifying the reasons for any failures in terms of achieving the Central Bank’s objects, recent developments, and outlook of the economy.

FIT as the Monetary Policy Framework

The Central Bank adopted FIT as the monetary policy framework in 2020, after following a hybrid monetary policy framework with features of both monetary targeting and FIT since 2015. However, the MLA did not explicitly recognise FIT as the relevant monetary policy framework in Sri Lanka even though the enabling conditions for successful implementation of FIT were facilitated under the MLA. The CBA provides for formal adoption of FIT with enabling conditions. Under this arrangement, a monetary policy framework agreement, which includes the inflation target and key parameters, is jointly signed by the Central Bank and the Minister of Finance and published in the Gazette within a period of one week from the date of such agreement. According to the monetary policy framework agreement, the MPB is to determine the appropriate monetary policy and monetary policy instruments relating to the implementation of the monetary policy of the Central Bank and have the authority to adjust such instruments for the purpose of implementing the monetary policy. The inflation target and related parameters will be reviewed every three years or in such other intervals under exceptional circumstances. Moreover, if the

Central Bank fails to meet the inflation target by the margin determined at the time of setting the inflation target, for two consecutive quarters, the MPB should submit a report to the Parliament through the Minister of Finance, which shall also be made available to the public. Meanwhile, under the CBA, the Central Bank shall publish a Monetary Policy Report, once every six months, explaining recent movements in inflation, sources of inflation, and medium term projections for inflation and key risks to such projections.

Supervision and Resolution of Financial Institutions and the Macroprudential Authority

The Central Bank continues to be the key responsible apex financial institution for the regulation, licensing, registration, and supervision of financial institutions as well as the resolutions of financial institutions in order to ensure financial system stability. Moreover, the CBA attributes the macroprudential authority to the Central Bank, with the view to securing the stability of the financial system in line with the macroprudential policy. In this regard, the Central Bank will establish a Financial System Oversight Committee (FSOC), and it is expected to examine the macroprudential policy to mitigate identified buildup of systemic risks affecting the financial system, issue recommendations to relevant public authorities on corrective actions while coordinating the implementation of macroprudential policy.4

Public Debt Management

As per the CBA, the Central Bank’s agency function of public debt management is to be removed from the Central Bank’s mandate once the relevant law relating to a public debt management agency or office comes into operation. However, until such date the Central Bank will continue the management of public debt as an agent of the Government.

Summary

Under the CBA, the autonomy of the Central Bank is respected at all times, enabling independent policymaking and implementation by the Central Bank to achieve the mandated objectives of maintaining domestic price stability and securing financial system stability. In the meantime, the CBA endorses more accountability and transparency of the Central Bank making it answerable to the legislature and the public. The primarily mandated objectives of price stability and increased accountability of the Central Bank would protect the country from disruptive effects of high and volatile inflation, and associated sharp movements in interest rates, thus fostering sustainable long term economic growth.

widen moderately in 2023 with a projected increase

in merchandise imports triggered by the gradual

normalisation of economic activity and possible

relaxation of some trade restrictions going forward.

The forecast of the trade deficit for 2023 could

also be affected by a possible economic downturn

in the United Kingdom, the European Union, and

the United States, possibly dampening external

demand. In addition, any further escalation of the

Russia-Ukraine war could impact global supply

chains, thereby increasing import expenditure. The

services account surplus is likely to increase in

2023 with the projected increase in earnings from

tourism as well as the envisaged improvement

in competitiveness of other services exports with

the gradual normalisation of domestic economic

activity and expected reduction in domestic inflation

during the second half of 2023. The primary income

account deficit is likely to widen marginally in

2023 due to the possible rise in borrowing costs

caused by monetary policy tightening in advanced

economies. The secondary income account surplus

is expected to widen in 2023 due to the persistently

high departures for foreign employment and the

expected rise in workers’ remittances. The possible

expansion in the trade deficit and primary income

account deficit would be cushioned by the envisaged

improvements in the services and secondary income

accounts, resulting in the current account deficit to

likely remain at a modest level in 2023. Inflows to the

financial account are expected to strengthen in 2023

with the recommencement of certain infrastructure

projects, envisaged Foreign Direct Investments

(FDIs), and foreign portfolio investment in the CSE

and government securities markets along with other

foreign financing flows from multilateral and bilateral

partners. These inflows are expected to strengthen

confidence among foreign investors in the prospects

of economic engagement with the Sri Lankan

economy in the period ahead. Moreover, the external

sector is expected to revert to a sustainable path

over the medium term, supported by the envisaged

successful progress of the debt restructuring as well

as the economic adjustment programme under the

IMF-EFF arrangement. The trade deficit is expected

to narrow down over the medium term as the growth

in exports is expected to outpace the increase in

imports. Meanwhile, with the gradual normalisation

of the global economy as well as increased mobility

of people across the globe, Sri Lanka is likely to

benefit from the prospects of its booming tourism

industry reaching its potential in the period ahead.

This, together with the expected rebound of activities

in transport services and high growth in the IT/BPO

services subsector, is envisaged to strengthen the

surplus in the services account over the medium

term. The primary income account deficit is

expected to moderate in the period ahead with the

expected reduction in interest payments due to the

debt restructuring programme. Further, workers’

remittances are expected to improve steadily over

the medium term with the gradual improvement

in departures for foreign employment, increased

demand for migrant labour, and continued recovery

in the flow of remittances through official channels.

Consequently, the external current account deficit is

expected to decline gradually to a sustainable low

level over the medium term. Moreover, financial

flows are expected to strengthen over the medium

term with the envisaged non debt creating inflows

to the Colombo Port City, Colombo West Container

Terminals, and the development of industrial zones,

such as the Hambantota Industrial Zone. Inflows to

the financial account are expected to be supported

by enhanced investor confidence following the

successful finalisation of the debt restructuring and

the economic adjustment programme supported by

the IMF-EFF arrangement. Portfolio investment as

well as other foreign financing flows are expected

to recover gradually supported by the envisaged

improvement in the macroeconomic performance

and positive investor sentiments over the medium

term. Consequently, the gross official reserves are

envisaged to strengthen over the medium term.

The Government is envisaged to continue

its commitment towards fiscal consolidation

and economic reform programme with the aim

of achieving the medium term fiscal targets set

out under the IMF-EFF supported programme.

The Government has announced an ambitious

revenue target exceeding 15 per cent of GDP

by 2027 along with the achievement of primary

surpluses over the medium to long term. To this

end, the Government has already implemented

strong revenue enhancement measures by raising

the VAT rate, telecommunication levy, and personal

and corporate income tax rates, expanding the

VAT and personal income tax base, increasing

the excise duty on petroleum products, liquor, and

tobacco products, and imposing the social security

contribution levy, among others. These revenue

enhancement measures are expected to yield

benefits in the near to medium term by reversing the

trend of dismal revenue performance observed in the

recent years. However, strengthening the revenue

administration measures is crucial to achieve

medium term revenue targets of the Government,

while providing some relief to taxpayer segments

who are already subject to an extremely high tax

burden. Meanwhile, the Government has taken

steps to rationalise and reduce expenditure, which

is imperative to curtail the fiscal deficit. However,

prioritisation of capital projects, identification and

38

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

1

curtailment of unproductive recurrent expenditure,

limiting public sector recruitment, improved

targeting of social safety nets, and expeditious

completion of the debt restructuring process are

imperative to contain government expenditure and

strengthen fiscal consolidation efforts in the medium

term, while minimising any potential negative

impact on economic activity. The completion of

the ongoing debt restructuring is expected to result

in a notable reduction in the Government’s debt

service burden and limit the annual gross financing

needs to below 13 per cent of GDP, on average,

during 2027-2032, as envisaged under the IMF-

EFF arrangement. Further, foreign currency debt

servicing of the central government is expected to

be maintained below 4.5 per cent of GDP in any year

during 2027-2032, thereby easing debt servicing

pressures to a large extent. Moreover, public debt

is envisaged to reduce to around 95 per cent of

GDP by 2032. The ambitious primary surplus path

in the medium term would assist in reducing the

debt accumulation over the medium term. At the

same time, divestments of non-strategic SOEs and

continuation of cost reflective prices for utilities

and other SOE reforms are envisaged to improve

the efficiency of SOEs and reduce the burden of

such entities on the government budget. Moreover,

the management of government finances is

expected to improve under the IMF-EFF supported

programme with the envisaged enactment of the

new public financial management legislation, which

would further strengthen fiscal rules. With the

completion of the proposed debt restructuring and

implementation of broad-based economic reforms

for efficiency, accountability, and transparency in

the public sector, the fiscal sector performance is

envisaged to improve sustainably over the medium

term, thereby overcoming major impediments to

economic growth that impacted the economy over

decades.

1.5 Issues and Policies

From being one of the most promising

nations in the developing world a few decades

ago to one that is struggling to overcome

multiple crises in the present day, successive

governments have failed to steer the island

nation towards sustained socio-economic

progress and prosperity. Despite the many

initiatives taken since independence, the country

has faced difficulties in thriving due to the

lack of a robust and consistent national policy

framework, resulting in poor macroeconomic

performance, sustained twin deficits reflecting

legacy issues and slow evolution, adaptability and

transformation, thereby losing pace and falling

behind peer economies, especially in the most

recent decades. Although the end of the three

decades long internal conflict provided the country

with the opportunity to make a new beginning,

the lack of far-sighted policies and dearth of

coherence in implementing corrective policy

actions and reforms, alongside numerous social,

political, and macroeconomic challenges have

been impediments to the economy in reaching its

potential. To overcome many of these challenges

and longstanding issues, policymakers and

relevant authorities need to urgently embark

on implementing several potentially painful yet

essential reforms. Most importantly, a crisis

presents several opportunities to bring about

change and implement reforms to address

structural issues, i.e., an opportunity to ‘reset’ the

economy. While commending several measures

that have been recently undertaken to address

some of these lasting issues, it is necessary

for the Government to remain committed to the

structural reform agenda over the medium term

and ensure that remaining actions are fulfilled

and such actions in the near term are aligned

with the medium term agenda, irrespective of

political agendas.

39

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

Sri Lanka’s resolve and commitment to

carrying out long overdue reforms would be

a major factor in shaping the direction of the

economy over the medium to long term. The

IMF-EFF arrangement, amounting to approximately

US dollars 3 billion, approved in March 2023, along

with the envisaged support from other international

financial institutions, is expected to provide the

policy space needed for the economy to transition

out of the unprecedented sovereign debt and BOP

crises in the near term. However, the non-recurrence

of such crises in the future and the medium to

long term sustainability of economic recovery

would hinge on the successful implementation

of the macroeconomic adjustment programme

outlined under the IMF-EFF arrangement that

needs to be underpinned by strong political will

and commitment. The integral elements of this

macroeconomic adjustment programme include,

(i) an ambitious fiscal consolidation led primarily

by revenue, accompanied by reforms to social

safety net, fiscal institutions and SOEs, aimed at

restoring fiscal sustainability and strengthening

fiscal discipline, (ii) a sovereign debt restructuring

strategy aimed at restoring public debt

sustainability, (iii) a multi-pronged strategy to restore

price stability and rebuild international reserves

amidst greater exchange rate flexibility, (iv) policies

to safeguard financial stability, (v) focused reforms to

address governance and corruption vulnerabilities,

(vi) broader structural reforms to unlock Sri Lanka’s

growth potential. Despite having engaged in

sixteen IMF programmes since 1965, Sri Lanka has

an unsatisfactory track record on the completion

of such programmes and the implementation of

reforms, due to abrupt abandoning of the reform

agenda. This has resulted in a futile cycle of

entry into such programmes during periods of

economic hardship and premature exit with short-

lived improvements in the economy. Against

this backdrop, it is vital that policymakers show

increased commitment and discipline in meeting the

envisaged time-bound targets during each review

under the present IMF-EFF arrangement, while

garnering public support for necessary economic

adjustments through improved awareness and

transparent communication. This will not only

give an opportunity to implement long neglected

structural reforms but will also put the economy on

a strong footing to transition to a sustainable growth

path over the medium term, without having to go

through extreme volatilities and painful adjustments

frequently. Successful implementation of the

necessary structural reforms would circumvent the

need to repeatedly approach the IMF for emergency

funding and prevent the need for debt restructuring.

The rapid normalisation of economic conditions

from the dire straits in the most part of 2022 is

expected to facilitate the implementation of the

aforementioned reforms. Notably, unlike previous

IMF programmes, many painful reforms have been

frontloaded in the current EFF arrangement; hence,

it is expected that the continuation of such reforms

will be relatively smoother, thereby enabling the

economy to be more successful at completing the

ongoing programme.

Going forward, Sri Lanka needs to ensure

effective prioritisation and utilisation of external

financing to maintain external debt sustainability

in the post-restructuring period. Sri Lanka had

issued a total of US dollars 17.6 billion of ISBs

from 2007 onwards and US dollars 17.2 billion of

Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) from 2001

onwards. The proceeds of ISBs and SLDBs were

primarily used for development purposes only in the

early issuances, while the proceeds of most of the

subsequent issuances were primarily used for budget

support or for debt repayments and interest payments

on such debt due to the significantly large budget

deficits and mounting external debt that escalated

the gross financing needs of the Government,

global markets at commercial rates. Accordingly, it

is vital that Sri Lanka‘s debt strategy evolves away

from reliance on highly commercial foreign currency

debt towards equity based foreign financing, amidst

envisaged improvements in international sovereign

ratings and country’s economic conditions. The

foreign financing mix and strategy need to be

carefully crafted by identifying purposes for which

such funds are used with a view to improving the

capacity to generate foreign exchange inflows. For

instance, attracting foreign financing into strategically

important projects, such as renewable energy, would

be vital in addressing energy sector vulnerabilities

without imposing excessive strains on the fiscal and

external sectors. Moreover, future attempts to resort

to any form of debt financing need to be evaluated

objectively against costs and benefits and the

need for such financing in order to ensure that debt

vulnerabilities do not arise in the future.

Successful implementation of the debt

restructuring process, in line with the debt

sustainability targets outlined under the

IMF-EFF arrangement, remains crucial prior

to opening the country to global financial and

capital markets. Sri Lanka needs to finalise the

debt restructuring process expeditiously in line with

the debt sustainability targets set out under the

IMF-EFF arrangement. Plans are underway to publicly

announce Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring strategy in

the near term following the public announcement

on the envisaged treatment of domestic debt in late

March 2023, enabling commencement of the debt

restructuring process at the earliest. Finalisation

of this process is anticipated before September

2023. Even after successful debt restructuring, any

improvement to international ratings will be a gradual

process and will depend on the success of rebuilding

the economy. International experience suggests

that after debt restructuring, countries have taken

considerable time to improve sovereign ratings and

build up confidence prior to attracting foreign financing

from bilateral and commercial creditors. Against this

backdrop, the country must endeavour to move away

from debt financing in the near to medium term and

find ways to attract non debt creating funding sources,

such as equity financing, primarily through foreign

direct investment and public-private partnership

arrangements.

Long overdue structural reforms need to

be carried out expeditiously to turn around

lossmaking SOEs and eliminate the fiscal

burden as well as the over-reliance on

commercial banks, thereby containing the

risks arising from these institutions that

hinder the fiscal and macroeconomic, and

financial stability. Although SOEs perform key

roles in numerous strategic economic sectors,

such as electricity, petroleum, water, banking,

transportation, and aviation, a significant share of

these entities continues to grapple with an array

of issues, including operational inefficiencies,

poor governance and mismanagement, lack of

accountability and transparency, weak market

orientation, continuing political interference through

high level appointments and excessive workforce.

These issues, in turn, have culminated in the weak

financial performance of SOEs, thereby resulting in

a multifaceted macroeconomic burden to the country

through their adverse implications on state owned

banks, and more recently on some private banks as

well, draining of public finances via capital infusions,

mounting contingent liabilities of the Government,

and with no satisfactory quality of service to the

general public. For instance, credit to public

corporations from the banking sector amounted

to Rs. 1.7 trillion4 as at the end of 2022, while the

Government was compelled to provide around

Rs. 80 billion to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB)

as equity during 2022 to ease its liquidity stresses.

Although SOEs in Sri Lanka are generally established

by an Act of Parliament, several SOEs have been

41

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

incorporated under the Companies Act, potentially

allowing them to bypass Parliamentary oversight. In

addition, timely preparation of financial accounts of

the large majority of SOEs and the disclosure of these

statements are largely absent, thereby hindering

transparency and public scrutiny. Despite the

identification of fraud, corruption, mismanagement,

and negligence in certain SOEs, such issues have

hardly been addressed promptly at respective Board

levels or at the Parliamentary committee levels.

In addition, successive governments have used

SOEs to implement populist policies. For example,

utilities and public sector services, including energy,

petroleum, water, transportation, etc., have been

provided to the general public at below cost recovery

prices for a long time. The costs of these untargeted

subsidies were borne by the SOEs, resulting in large

accumulated losses, which were mostly covered

by transfers from the central government budget.

Non-cost reflective prices have been the major

reason for the bleak financial performance and

poor market orientation of the major SOEs in

the country. All the aforementioned issues have

disincentivised SOEs to operate as profitable

commercial ventures, thereby imposing an undue

burden on the Government, banks and the public.

When borrowings of SOEs were at unsustainably

high levels, in the past, the Government has been

compelled to step in to relieve such debt burden using

its revenue collection. As part of the actions agreed

under the IMF-EFF arrangement, the outstanding

foreign currency debt of Rs. 884.1 billion of the

Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (US dollars 2,434.8

million) was absorbed into central government debt

by end 2022. In addition, the outstanding balance

of eight loans amounting to Rs. 518.3 billion (US

dollars 1,427.3 million), obtained from China’s

Export-Import (EXIM) Bank and recorded under

Sri Lanka Ports Authority, CEB, and Airport and

Aviation Services (Pvt) Ltd., were also absorbed into

central government debt by end 2022. Against this

backdrop, institutional reforms are highly warranted

in relation to SOEs to improve their efficiency,

financial viability, and accountability. Recognising

the need to make SOEs financially viable, the

IMF-EFF arrangement prescribed the introduction of

cost reflective price revisions of several key utilities.

Such pricing mechanisms need to continue with

enhanced transparency to ensure that the SOEs

are not only generating increased revenues but are

also striving to reduce costs, without passing on

their inefficiencies by way of higher prices. Further,

non-strategic SOBEs should be considered

for divestiture or listing in the CSE to reduce

the fiscal burden of such entities and

ensure improved institutional and commercial

efficiency. The institutional transparency and

accountability of remaining SOEs should be

enhanced through mandatory and regular

Parliamentary oversight. The SOEs should be

provided with binding institutional goals and targets

that are linked to key performance indicators, for

which the management of SOEs should be held

accountable. The perks and benefits received by the

respective Boards, the management and employees

of these SOEs should be linked to their performance

and achievement of institutional goals. Accordingly,

it is vital that the Government remains committed

to implementing the SOE reform agenda to ensure

that such enterprises emerge as growth facilitators

in the economy. Moreover, as already identified

by the Government, the energy sector will need

drastic reforms through unbundling of generation,

transmission, and distribution subsectors to achieve

operational efficiency in the electricity sector. It is

also necessary for SOEs, such as CEB, to review

commercial contracts entered into with private

power suppliers ensuring that undue benefits are

not passed onto such companies at significant costs

to CEB. These institutional reforms of SOEs should

be implemented without delay to ensure efficiency

and transparency of SOEs, while minimising burden

on central government finances.

Reforms to taxation policies and tax

administration and the strengthening

of the legal compliance framework are

paramount to achieving the revenue targets

of the Government, thereby restoring the

macroeconomic balance in the period ahead.

Recognising the persistently lacklustre revenue

performance in Sri Lanka, compared to peer

economies, the Government has already adopted

several measures to increase tax rates while also

expanding the tax base. However, additional

reforms, especially in relation to the application

of advanced information and communication

technology to further enhance government revenue

mobilisation on a sustainable basis are essential.

The tax system in Sri Lanka has been plagued by

inconsistent and ad hoc policy changes that are

targeted to serve as short term fixes, mainly in light

of revenue shortfalls each year. The introduction of

retrospective surcharge tax and frequently changing

government policy on taxes on business turnover

are examples of such inconsistent tax policies. As

a result, submitting tax returns and forecasting tax

liabilities have become cumbersome for businesses

and individuals, in turn discouraging taxpayers from

maintaining voluntary tax compliance. A weak tax

administration system could serve to mobilise a

high tax revenue from easy to tax sectors, whereas

the need is to implement an equitable tax system,

where the burden of taxes is distributed fairly

among the population. Accordingly, the tax policies

in the country should be formulated considering

the revenue requirements of the Government,

development objectives of the country, equity of

tax policies, and convenience for both the taxpayer

and tax administrator. Meanwhile, tax administration

should be strengthened to minimise administration

costs, tax avoidance, tax evasion, and various tax

frauds. While existing weaknesses in the Revenue

Administration and Management Information

System (RAMIS) that have resulted in substantial

revenue losses to the Government need to be

rectified expeditiously, new technologies should be

introduced for tax revenue collection of both direct

and indirect taxes. For example, the introduction

of a real time invoicing system will help prevent

frauds related to value added and turnover taxes

and provide opportunities to conduct tax audits

efficiently. In addition, linking databases of revenue

collection agencies, financial institutions, and other

property registration institutions would help reduce

tax evasion, thereby expanding the taxpayer base.

The introduction of cutting edge technologies, such

as blockchains, integrated customs management

systems, cargo scanners, and trackers have

helped many countries to minimise cross border

tax evasion. Sri Lanka has a large informal sector,

which is hardly captured by the tax net, while many

in the formal sector are also evading taxes due to

cash transactions since revenue collecting agencies

are unable to track income received through cash

payments by individuals and businesses. Therefore,

revenue collection agencies will be able to track tax

evaders as well as those who engage in benami

transactions by promoting a ‘cashless economy’.

Meanwhile, the tax collection process is significantly

burdened by the current appeal and grievance

handling process, which is highly time consuming and

prevents revenue collection agencies from achieving

their revenue collection targets. There appears to be

a large number of unsettled cases in respect of tax

avoidance, non-payment of taxes, and extended

time periods given for tax evaders. For purposes

of transparency, Inland Revenue Department (IRD)

should publish the number of pending and settled

tax cases on a periodic basis to enable the general

public to understand efforts made by the IRD to

expedite tax collections. Further, the introduction of

an efficient appeal process and expeditious judicial

process to resolve tax disputes will drastically cut

down tax losses to the Government. Besides, to

enhance voluntary compliance, strict penalties

should be introduced, while improving services to

taxpayers with proper guidance. Recent efforts of the

43

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

Government to make the filing of personal income

tax returns mandatory and payment of personal

income taxes electronically are welcome initiatives

to improve the efficiency in tax administration. The

Government should increase its efforts to improve

tax administration, which, in turn, would enable

the Government to expand the tax base and raise

government revenue without significantly burdening

its existing taxpayers.

Recently introduced painful tax reforms

should be complemented with proper

expenditure management strategies to

ensure a sustained fiscal consolidation in the

medium to long run. Although tax reforms are

imperative to improve government finances, such

measures could even be counterproductive if

not accompanied by efficient public expenditure

reforms, as additional revenue from taxes could

be allocated for inefficient public expenditure

programmes due to lack of expenditure curtailment

and rationalisation strategies. A large fraction of

government expenditure in Sri Lanka remains

rigid in nature with a significant share of expenses

allocated for salaries and wages, pension and

subsidies, and interest payments. However,

the implementation of appropriate expenditure

management techniques can create leeway for

expenditure curtailment. In preparation of the

annual budget of the Government, traditional

budgeting techniques, such as the incremental

budgeting process,5 need to be replaced by more

effective counterparts, i.e., a zero-based budgeting6

mechanism, which would enable the Government to

identify unnecessary and less productive activities

and eliminate such expenses, while allocating

scarce resources to meet the pressing needs of

the economy, thereby paving way for growth and

development. While some attempts have already

5 In the incremental budgeting process, the previous year’s budget is considered as the base and adjustments are made to this base by adding certain percentages mainly on an arbitrary basis to maintain the current level of operations.

6 Zero-based budgeting is a budgeting technique in which all expenses must be justified for a new period or year starting from zero, versus starting with the previous budget and adjusting it as needed.

been taken by the Government to implement

zero-based budgeting techniques, concerted efforts

are needed to effectively adopt and implement

this budgeting process, especially by training the

staff of spending agencies, who contribute to the

preparation of government budgets. Further, in lieu

of imposing a blanket approach to the curtailment

of expenditure of all spending agencies, measures

should be implemented with due consideration to

the priority of each economic activity within the

development agenda, its resource requirements,

and resource availability. A customised and

case-by-case assessment is required when

implementing expenditure rationalisation in order

to ensure that effective spending agencies receive

the required resources, while inefficient ones

are required to assess their effectiveness and

adopt rationalisation measures. Meanwhile, the

prioritisation of capital expenditure based on ‘value

for money’ and the importance of the projects within

the development agenda are key to ensure the

effective allocation of funds for capital expenditure

projects. Therefore, improved budgeting techniques

and rational resource allocation will be pivotal

in achieving a primary balance surplus by the

Government in the medium term in line with the

IMF-EFF programme parameters.

Energy security in the country was challenged

by the recent economic crisis, underscoring

the need to address inefficiencies in the energy

sector. Reflecting the poor resilience of the energy

sector to external shocks and limited diversification

of energy generation despite the vast potential,

provisioning of electricity and other energy services

was largely disrupted in 2022, leading to an energy

crisis with long power outages and severe fuel

shortages, thereby affecting economic activity.

Although hydropower remains the most cost effective

source of power generation, Sri Lanka’s larger

reliance on hydropower generation continues to

be a concern in terms of sustainability of electricity

44

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

provisioning with its extreme susceptibility to climatic

dynamics. Further, the power generation is also

heavily exposed to volatilities in global energy

prices with its high reliance on imported thermal

power sources of coal and petroleum products.

Despite the numerous efforts to expand the share of

Non-Conventional Renewable Energy (NCRE)

for power generation, private investors in the

renewable energy sector continued to grapple with

numerous challenges, such as difficulties in obtaining

approvals from multiple institutions, environment

impact concerns as well as the absence of regular

revisions in feed in tariff systems, thereby hindering

the private sector led expansion in the NCRE sector.

In this context, urgent measures are needed to strike

a balance between the availability in the energy

generation sources and the generation cost of those

sources, enabling a choice of an efficient generation

mix going forward. In order to expand the share of

renewable energy in the generation mix, attracting

investments from private and foreign sources for

clean energy sources, such as solar, wind, etc., which

are abundant in Sri Lanka, remains vital, facilitated by

a conducive investment climate with straightforward

approaches on regulations and taxation, adequate

infrastructure, and good governance, among others.

As per the Sustainable Development Goals Investor

Map - 2022 of the United National Development

Programme, Sri Lanka’s renewable energy sector

has been recognised as one of the priority sectors

with high investment potential, highlighting the need

for measures targeted at encouraging investments

in the renewable energy sector. In this regard,

policymakers should focus on enabling peer-to-peer

power purchase agreements and power wheeling

facilities for the private sector, which ensure market

determined pricing for the renewable energy sector.

In the meantime, improving energy infrastructure in

the form of developments to the transmission and

distribution networks, upgradation and modernisation

of power generation facilities, smart grid

management, and enhancement of energy storage

solutions are needed to reduce energy losses and

enhance the reliability of power supply. Meanwhile,

energy efficiency in the transport sector must be

improved through the introduction of technologies

to enhance the fuel efficiency of vehicles, such as

hybrid technologies, while exploring alternatives

for clean energy sources for the transport sector.

Further, a more focused policy approach is essential

to improve and expand the public transportation

system to reduce energy consumption in the

transport sector. Accordingly, public transport modes

and road infrastructure should be modified and

expanded, aimed at minimising energy wastage with

traffic congestion in urban areas. Also, increasing

awareness among the public on energy efficiency

and conservation measures and implementation

of energy efficiency standards and practices in

households, businesses, and industries would

promote efficient utilisation of energy. In essence,

energy security can be achieved by improving the

availability of energy supply without disruptions and

meeting the rising energy demand at an affordable

price for consumers. In this regard, enhancing the

resilience of the energy sector to promptly respond to

abrupt changes in the supply and demand is required

in the near term. Similarly, in the long run, fostering

investments to supply energy commensurate with

economic developments and environmental needs,

is imperative, in addition to concerted efforts of all the

stakeholders in the economy.

Institutional and legislative reforms as well as

enforcement of rules and regulations are needed

to strengthen the oversight of public expenditure

management and increase fiscal sector

accountability. Although fiscal rules have been

enacted in Sri Lanka about a couple of decades ago,

they have not been adhered to, resulting in imprudent

fiscal management by successive governments.

Therefore, legislative reforms are needed to

introduce fiscal rules that are binding with realistic

targets, while distinctly identifying the responsible

45

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

authorities to comply with those rules. Under the

IMF-EFF supported programme, a new Public

Financial Management Act is to be enacted,

which will specify the roles and responsibilities of

the Ministry of Finance and spending agencies

and establish information and accountability

requirements. In addition, government entities should

be encouraged not only to limit spending within the

budget, but also to boost efficiency and effectiveness.

Further, performance based accountability and public

disclosure should be introduced for government

entities and public officials, while audit functions need

to be further strengthened to promote transparency,

enhance credibility, and support good governance.

Further, under the IMF-EFF supported programme,

anti-corruption legislation that is harmonised with

the United Nations Convention against Corruption

(UNCAC) is to be introduced with technical assistance

from the IMF. This is particularly pertinent considering

that Sri Lanka ranked 101 out of 180 countries in the

Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI)7 – 2022, reflecting

a high level of perceived corruption. Strengthening

corruption control measures and transparency of

procedures can also play a key role in the curtailment

of unproductive government expenditure. Hence, in

the period ahead, fiscal prudence along with continued

commitment to strengthening the oversight of public

finances and implementation of corruption control

measures will be centric to garnering public support

for fiscal consolidation measures and ensuring overall

sustainability and discipline of the fiscal sector.

Export sector policies need to focus on

improving the sophistication of goods and

services to increase domestic value addition

and to strengthen export competitiveness.

Although Sri Lanka recorded its historically highest

export earnings in 2022, such earnings are meagre

when compared to those recorded by similar sized

economies in the region. Sri Lankan products

are losing market shares in global markets due

7 The country with the least level of corruption is ranked at the first place in the CPI.

to the stagnant sophistication of products and

increasing production costs eroding the country’s

competitiveness. Producing higher quality products

helps compete in global markets by building on

existing comparative advantages to boost export

revenues and productivity. Export industries need

to aim at differentiation, value addition, branding,

and increasing the quality of exports, while meeting

quantity requirements. Export promotion policies

need to focus on exporting improved quality goods

with high value addition at lower costs of production,

backed by Research and Development (R&D) led

innovation over the medium to long term. R&D should

be enhanced to identify the innovations in the export

sectors and to transition from simple products to

complex products. Also, Sri Lanka needs to upgrade

its product quality with the objective of tapping into

regional and global supply chains and capturing

market shares in emerging market economies. In

addition, the Government needs to provide incentives

to indirect exporters and domestic industries, which

can competitively substitute imported raw materials,

as input quality has a significant bearing on the

quality of the final output. Further, the downward

trend observed in agricultural exports in recent years

necessitates the importance of improving the quality

of agricultural products to be competitive globally.

In this regard, policies and measures focusing on

promoting the production of export oriented regional

speciality agricultural products are needed in order

to form a strong quality and brand advantage in

the global markets. Methods of farmer societies

may be used to improve the ability of R&D and

achieve economies of scale through high production

at lower costs. Development of a national level

agricultural research strategy on improving crop

breeds with high yields and better quality with the

farmer level engagement would be necessary.

The establishment of commercial logistics and

warehouse facilities needs to be promoted in the

major agricultural regions to reduce post-harvest

damage to agricultural products. Further, policies

46

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

1

should focus on enhancing institutional quality,

maintenance of liberal and consistent trade policies,

promotion of FDI inflows to the export sector,

development of human capital capable of upgrading

export quality, and creation of a conducive domestic

environment to conduct quality upgrading, while

improving access to high end export markets.

The country needs to make sacrificial

structural adjustments to move away from heavy

import reliance and become more export oriented

through a significant reorientation of national

trade policy. Sri Lanka is heavily reliant on imports

for consumption and investment needs and for

inputs needed for the production of key exports and

domestic production. Since 2009, the expenditure

on imports has nearly doubled. Meanwhile, the

composition of the export basket remained the

same over decades, limited to traditional agricultural

exports and low value added industrial exports, such

as garments. The revised National Export Strategy

(NES) 2018 – 2022, launched in July 2018, was

aimed at transforming Sri Lanka into an export hub

driven by innovation and investment. It was expected

to improve the business environment for all export

sectors through logistics, information and promotion,

national quality infrastructure, and innovation and

entrepreneurship. The specific mandate of NES

was promoting innovation and diversification in

six export sectors, including IT/BPO and wellness

tourism. Resolving issues in relation to provisioning

of labour for export industries, consistency in import

policies, clear and transparent tax policies, outreach

to foreign governments to attract investment into

Sri Lanka, and development of entrepreneurship

among the youth remain some of the immediate

priorities in the tradable sector. Measures were

needed to impose import restrictions and

suspensions amidst BOP crises. However, such

ad hoc measures can be avoided in the future

by lessening reliance on imports and promoting

industries in the economy. Backward integration

of possible intermediate inputs, discouraging

clearly identified non-essential consumer goods

with domestic substitutions, removing concessions

granted on imports, and maintaining a market

determined flexible exchange rate remain important

elements in this aspect.

Sri Lanka’s experience in terms of the

magnitude and growth in FDI over the last

few decades has been disappointing, despite

FDI being identified as the top priority in the

country’s development strategies by successive

governments. Sri Lanka has managed to attract

only around US dollars 1.2 billion as FDI, including

foreign loans to Direct Investment Enterprises

(DIEs), per annum, on average, since 2010,

despite offering superabundant tax holidays. Also,

the FDI to GDP ratio has remained significantly

low, compared to other peer countries. In addition,

in the current context of the Sri Lankan economy,

there is very little incentive for corporates to shift

their bases to Sri Lanka due to the disruptions to

economic activities, high corporate income tax rates,

high cost of production, including that of labour and

utilities, scarcity of skilled labour, unavailability of

readily available land, bureaucratic and multiple

approval procedures, and perceived corruption. The

Government’s recent efforts, such as the proposed

amalgamation of the Board of Investment (BOI) and

Export Development Board (EDB), among others,

to streamline the institutional structure applicable to

this sector is a welcome move. Yet, it is essential

to empower such authorities to attract investments

and grant approvals in an efficient manner. In the

meantime, close diplomatic collaboration with

friendly nations would be instrumental in exploring

investment opportunities for financing strategic

investment projects, such as projects enhancing

energy security, food security, and export oriented

industries that have broader spillover effects on

the overall economy. The country’s investment

needs should be clearly identified and promoted

47

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

among prospective investors and such investment

approvals and implementations should be expedited

through adoption of one-stop shop approach.

An Investor Facilitation Centre (IFC) established

under the Board of Investment in October 2022

is a welcome initiative in this regard. The IFC

is dedicated to providing an efficient service to

investors by streamlining the investment approval

process and enhancing interagency coordination

for investor facilitation. Exploiting investment based

non-liability creating inflows should be one of the key

elements of Sri Lanka’s economic revival strategy

going forward.

Measures to increase tourist arrivals and

a proper network to capture tourism earnings

are urgently needed at a time when Sri Lanka

aggressively promotes tourism. Sri Lanka has

been heavily reliant on the tourism sector for foreign

exchange earnings and has been using tourism

earnings to partly setoff the burden of heavy trade

deficit experienced since 2011. The country should

attempt to get the maximum benefit from tourism

earnings as tourist arrivals are gradually recovering.

However, the estimate of foreign exchange earnings

from tourism is compiled by the Sri Lanka Tourism

Development Authority (SLTDA) based on the

average number of guest nights of a tourist and

how much a tourist spends on average in Sri Lanka

on a day based on data provided by hotels and an

exit survey at the airport. The outcome of this exit

survey is used to determine the per day spending

which, however, is relatively higher than many

other popular tourism destinations in the region,

questioning its accuracy. Also, the daily spending

could vary among different tourist categories,

types of accommodation, and nature of the source

country, among many other factors. Therefore, an

appropriate information network is vital to accurately

capture how much is being earned by separate

stakeholders of the tourism industry. The Tourism

Satellite Account initiative in collaboration with the

Department of Census and Statistics and SLTDA

under technical guidance from the United Nations

may support to develop a better understanding of

tourist earnings although it is still being developed

in Sri Lanka. Further, as many tourists book their

accommodation through websites, such as Airbnb,

Agoda, and Booking.com, they would be useful in

obtaining information. Meanwhile, a tourism travel

app for tourists to book accommodation and obtain

tourism related information is being developed by

the SLTDA. However, tourists trust bookings made

through well known apps, especially when it comes to

making payments, protecting individual information,

and obtaining loyalty discounts. Therefore, finding

methods to ensure that there are corresponding

foreign exchange inflows to the country via bookings

made through international websites and apps

and from informal accommodation providers listed

in these websites and apps is necessary, while

developing local booking websites and apps.

Further, a proper mechanism is needed to obtain

foreign exchange earnings records of all parties

involved in the tourism industry and enter them

into the banking system, while the inclusion of

unregistered establishments in the system should

be expedited to eliminate the high level of informality

in the sector.

Mass migration of professionals and skilled

workers is likely to lead to a scarcity of labour in

selected industries alongside a substantial drop

in productivity, thus affecting the economic

growth of the country significantly during the

recovery phase and beyond. There has been a

mass emigration of qualified personnel, such as

doctors, engineers, bankers, and IT professionals,

prompted by the worst economic crisis. As per

the statistics of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign

Employment (SLBFE), the total number of registered

departures for foreign employment has increased by

more than 37 per cent in 2022 to 311,056, compared

to the annual average of 226,510 during 2015-2019,

48

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

1

while the corresponding increase in professionals

migration has been over 87 per cent. In addition to the

temporary migration for employment, the permanent

human capital flight has been more prominent since

2022, although official statistics on this are limited.

Available statistics at SLBFE further reveal that the

number of professionals, as a share of total labour

migration, has been increasing steadily over the

post-war period, recording a year-on-year growth

of over 20 per cent on average. This suggests

that the phenomenon of brain drain in Sri Lanka

may span since much before the current economic

crisis. In the current context, falling real wages and

the decline in quality of life amidst the economic

and financial uncertainties due to the contraction

in the economy have prompted Sri Lankans to

migrate. The longstanding structural issues of

the country, which have severely weakened the

institutional infrastructure in the areas of healthcare,

law enforcement, government administration,

public transport, etc., have also contributed to the

deterioration of socio-economic conditions. The

large outward migration of workers disrupts business

activity and such loss of expertise creates the need

to continuously train new employees, which requires

substantial time and resources, leading to a loss

of capacity and output over the short term. In fact,

some studies have quantified the logistical cost of

recruiting and training new employees itself to be

over 20 per cent of the cost due to the output lost

until new employees are trained to an optimal level.8

The long term impact of large skilled migration

could be substantial due to the loss of productivity

in the country, especially considering the overall

ageing population. Literature also identifies positive

spillovers of brain drain, particularly due to improved

networks, skill transfer, and remittances.9 However,

in the Sri Lankan context, costs may outweigh such

benefits. Most individuals, who migrated over the

recent past, have been internationally employable

and highly qualified personnel with substantial

entrepreneurial capacity, and therefore, in some

instances, their migration may result in the relocation

or closure of entire businesses, including some

export businesses. As a result, the economic cost

of such outward migration may far outweigh the loss

of direct contribution of respective individuals. In the

public sector, the unavailability of professionals can

have multifaceted implications in the periods ahead

as it adds to the lacuna of skills which can thereby

exacerbate the low levels of efficiency in many

such institutions. The recent changes introduced

in the public sector, such as allowing government

employees to obtain no-pay leave to undertake

foreign employment, could further exacerbate

these issues, though they could vary substantially

depending on the institution and level of skills and

expertise of the migrants. In addition to the economic

cost due to the loss of contribution of these workers,

the country also bears significant losses due to

inadequate returns on investment made on free

provisioning of education and healthcare. Although

there are deficiencies in many areas, Sri Lanka

is among a small group of countries in the world

that provides free education to its citizens until the

university level. However, the country has not been

able to reap the full benefits of this large investment,

for which brain drain is also a major contributing

factor. Amid these issues, several short term

measures have been adopted by certain sectors

to retain their employees, such as pay hikes and

other benefits including flexible working conditions,

non-cash benefits to reduce the tax burden, inflation

linked wages, and US dollar linked wages, among

others. Such short term measures to address the

prevailing economic crisis could be helpful. However,

rectifying longstanding structural weaknesses in the

economy which affect the quality of life, including

the creation of sustained growth, will be essential to

putting an end to the brain drain phenomenon that

49

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

has accelerated during the last year. Moreover, the

Government could explore the possibility of opening

up the country for foreign skilled professionals for

needy sectors in the near term to support economic

activity amidst mass migration. Coupled with such

attempts, targeted measures, such as special

benefit schemes and research funding to qualified

personnel, could motivate migrant professionals to

return to the country.

The Micro, Small and Medium scale

Enterprises (MSME) sector has been among the

most affected sectors in the economy during the

recent and ongoing economic crises, stressing

the importance of improving the resilience of

the sector for overall economic development

and welfare. The MSME sector, which is the

backbone of the Sri Lankan economy, has endured

numerous challenges over the past several years

with consecutive adverse events, such as the Easter

Sunday attacks in 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic in

2020 and 2021, and the subsequent economic crisis

in 2022. Activity of MSMEs that operate in a wide

range of segments was critically impacted by reduced

demand amidst uncertainties, rising inflation and

wages, a depreciated exchange rate, unavailability

of raw materials, interruptions to power and other

utilities, and heightened financing costs, among

others. As a result, national output, employment and

livelihoods were severely affected, raising the need

for the implementation of urgent remedial measures

to support MSMEs through this difficult period.

Several measures, such as offering concessions on

the loans obtained and the granting of debt moratoria,

were provided to the sector to temporarily overcome

the cashflow challenges. However, lasting solutions

are essential to enhance the capacity and resilience

of MSMEs to weather unfavourable financial and

economic conditions. Accordingly, the setting up

of a Credit Guarantee Institution (CGI), which was

identified as an essential requirement to serve the

funding considerations of MSMEs, has reached

its final stages and the expeditious establishment

is expected. Once the CGI is in operation, funding

constraints of MSMEs are expected to ease notably

going forward, while participating financial institutions

will also be encouraged to lend to MSMEs as the

associated credit risk will be shared. In addition,

banks and other financial institutions are also

expected to identify MSMEs as a priority sector in their

lending operations, which would avail funding for the

sector. In order to support local MSMEs to become

large scale enterprises, relevant authorities should

make use of existing international relations and

take advantage of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs),

thereby paving the way for MSMEs to integrate into

global value chains as well as trade internationally.

Such opportunities would not only help them

attain global standards but would also contribute

towards enhancing foreign exchange inflows to the

country. To support this endeavour, steps should

be taken to enhance the financial and technical

know-how, while also building skills and capacity

to use e-commerce technologies, which open the

gateway to the world market. Also, in order to foster

growth in the MSME sector, the Government and

relevant authorities should create an entrepreneurially

enabling environment and ecosystem by way of

easing rules, regulations, and bureaucratic red tape.

While the above initiatives would assist MSMEs to

build resilience, overcome the challenges posed by

unfavourable socio-economic developments, and

prosper as useful business entities that contribute

to the betterment of Sri Lanka, a blanket approach

to implementing the same may be suboptimal.

Therefore, a mechanism should be in place to identify

and recognise affected MSMEs that display potential

and contribute positively to the economy, from those

that are unviable and less productive, so that support

could be targeted to useful MSMEs, as assisting the

unviable ones would be unhealthy and costly. Further,

it is imperative that insolvency laws are established

and further strengthened, particularly in relation to the

MSME sector, among others.

The downward rigidity in domestic prices of

imported goods remains a concern in lowering

the domestic cost of living, considering the

disproportionate increase in prices of imported

items in the recent past. Over the past year or so,

prices of several food and non-food items, which have

closely been driven by prices of petroleum oil, gas,

and other imported goods, increased sharply due

to immediate and more than complete transmission

of price increases of global commodity prices and

local currency depreciation. However, the reduction

in global prices, reduction in costs of logistics and

adjustments in operational costs, and the recent

improvement in the exchange rate have not been fully

reflected in the imported prices of goods and services

even with a reasonable lag. The uncertainty prevailing

over the current economic conditions of the country

could be a major contributory factor for this apparent

downward stickiness of prices, where merchants may

be reluctant to adjust prices due to factors such as

high costs of old inventories, pre-agreed contracts,

limited confidence over policy direction and concerns

over the sustainability of positive developments,

and partly to offset the revenue losses related to

lower demand. Nevertheless, inflated prices of

some import related goods and services need to be

adjusted downwards along with the return of stability

in overall economic conditions if the economy is to

derive full benefits of the same. Such adjustments

would be beneficial for all parties since the demand

conditions would also be normalised with appropriate

movements of prices. Meanwhile, the adjustment of

energy prices, which is a primary channel through

which global price developments are transmitted

to the domestic economy, is an essential factor in

this regard. Alignment of domestic energy prices

with global prices and transparent adjustment to

prices, as it happens at present, would help ensure

that domestic energy prices remain predictable.

This would aid businesses to confidently plan their

future costs, leading to stability in overall price levels,

thereby reducing the risk of unexpected inflationary

pressures, and contributing to managing inflation

expectations. Further, producing robust inflation

projections is vital to set the inflation targets and

support monetary policy decisions under the FIT

of the Central Bank. Since these projections are

often conditional on global price movements, a

proper reflection of global price trends in domestic

prices is crucial to limit policy errors. In view of the

above, relevant authorities, including the authorities

involved with domestic energy price adjustments and

other regulatory authorities, such as the Consumer

Affairs Authority, among others, are required to be

vigilant about imported prices of goods where fair

passthrough of downward price adjustments needs

to take place. Such passthrough will help reduce the

high cost of living with a faster disinflation process as

anticipated.

The lingering impacts of the deepened

economic crisis on the welfare of the citizens of

Sri Lanka have been significant, underscoring

the urgent need to reformulate policy strategies

to ensure the welfare of the most vulnerable

groups. The burden of the economic crisis has

fallen disproportionately. Living conditions of the

vulnerable population have deteriorated to a greater

extent through various channels, including the

loss of livelihoods and the acceleration of inflation,

among others. The updated national poverty line for

Sri Lanka surged to Rs. 13,777 in 2022, registering

an annual increase of 74 per cent. This surge

implies that the costs of necessities in the form of

basic food, clothing, and shelter have risen, resulting

in an increase in the minimum monthly expenditure

per person. According to the remote household food

security survey of the World Food Programme, 85

per cent of the population was estimated to be relying

on livelihood based coping strategies, such as

borrowing money, reducing spending on education

and health, spending savings, or deferring due debt

payments. Whilst a larger share of employment is

occupied in the informal sector and 14.3 per cent

51

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

of the population is living below the poverty line,

the brunt of the crisis is likely to be devastating and

causing broad based driving of people into poverty.

Also, the current crisis widens the socio-economic

inequalities among population groups, spurring

generational poverty. This is because as households

become poorer, lower wealth accumulation

negatively affects the education and healthcare

that these households avail which in turn affects

their future income generating capacity, thereby

creating a vicious cycle. In this context, although

the Government has taken several measures to

safeguard vulnerable communities in the population

and to avoid further worsening of poverty levels

by increasing subsidy levels under the prevailing

social safety net programmes and providing cash

and in-kind grants with the support of international

financing agencies, among others, the efficiency of

such programmes has been challenged due to their

weak targeting. While vulnerable communities as

well as groups on the edge of poverty in the country,

continued to grapple with income losses since the

onset of the pandemic, the delay in recognising

new poverty pockets in the population, who are

desperate in need of government assistance, due

to the absence of a reliable updated database, have

resulted in inefficient allocation of limited fiscal funds

and foreign assistance. Therefore, it is vital to expedite

the measures that have already been implemented

under the Welfare Benefit Board to develop a registry

of needy people without further delay to ensure

that assistance reaches the intended beneficiaries

in time. Meanwhile, with the completion of reforms

in relation to Social Safety Nets (SSN) under the

IMF-EFF arrangement, including operationalising

of the Welfare Benefit Board, developing eligibility

criteria along with the ongoing efforts to develop

a social registry as well as the introduction of new

welfare benefit payment scheme are expected to

support vulnerable people from the impact of the

economic crisis and policy adjustments. Under this,

the Government’s commitment to operationalising

reforms, such as obtaining Parliamentary approval

for the welfare benefits payment system and

eligibility criteria by May 2023 and its plan to expand

spending floor on SSN would be vital in alleviating

poverty on a long term basis. While pursuing

these reforms, enforcement of a government led

multisectoral policy approach with the collaboration

of all the stakeholders of the economy remains

important in eradicating poverty, thereby assuring

the equitable benefits of future growth prospects

to all the segments of the population. Further, the

recent initiatives taken by the Government with

the collaboration of the Department of Census and

Statistics to conduct a household survey on the

impact of the economic crisis are commendable in

this regard, which is expected to deliver a proper

assessment of the vulnerabilities of the families.

Such databases and survey findings would enable

effectiveness of policy interventions on poverty

eradication through the improved quality, adequacy,

and timeliness of data, thereby strengthening

evidence based informed policy decisions in the

future, and improvements to existing social safety

net mechanisms also remain important. Under this,

the digitalisation of subsidy distribution mechanism,

via the introduction of digital banking systems,

payment cards as well as digital identity options

would support to minimise inefficiencies and possible

leakages in welfare payments. Further, in the midst

of the Government’s expenditure rationalisation

drive, a holistic assessment of existing poverty

eradication strategies is required to improve the

efficacy of expenditure. Such an assessment

can help identify areas in which the Government

may seek collaborations with the private sector

and relevant multilateral organisations. Poverty

eradication efforts should also comprise other

multisector interventions, such as the promotion of

value additions in the agriculture sector, expanding

education opportunities for poor and vulnerable

groups to ensure future income opportunities,

promoting livelihood development programmes

52

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

1

along with the improvement of the participation of

women in labour markets as well as the adoption of

a systematic policy framework for existing safety net

programmes alongside the gradual improvements to

income levels.

The national policy planning mechanism and

holistic implementation need to be strengthened

in order to support the country to embark on a

strong economic recovery and growth. A major

predicament for promoting both domestic and

foreign investments in the country is the lack of

policy consistency, which is detrimental to economic

and financial decision making and planning ahead

for businesses. As changes in governments often

bring about major policy reversals, policy formulation

needs to be completely detached from political cycles

to maintain consistency. National planning needs to

be focused on productivity improvements across the

economy where all resources are optimally utilised. A

national plan needs to be formulated by experts, both

in the public and private sectors, in each area and

be consented to by the Parliament before adoption. It

is also important to develop strategic policy clusters,

where there exist synergistic outcomes, e.g., a policy

that recognises the synergies in nutrition agriculture

and livestock production, land use, and environmental

policies with an emphasis on countering the effects

of climate change that could ensure optimum long

term outcomes in those areas. Also, the export policy

should be related to the foreign affairs, investment

promotion, industrial and agricultural policies, while the

mineral use policy should be related to the industrial

policy. Over-reliance on few bilateral partners for

exports, investments, workers’ remittances, and

foreign funding could give rise to vulnerabilities

that could have reverberations on foreign policy,

national security, and the country’s sovereignty at

large. An independent policy monitoring mechanism

should also be in place, where individuals who fail to

implement policies to reach desired outcomes are

held accountable.

The reliance of the public sector on the

banking system has continued relentlessly over

the recent years resulting in the crowding out of

private sector investment, increasing inflationary

pressures and stresses in the financial system.

Poor fiscal performance and the loss of access

to external financing amidst sovereign rating

downgrades, necessitated the Government to seek

funding mainly from the Central Bank and state

owned commercial banks to finance its budget deficit

and debt servicing since the onset of the pandemic.

Meanwhile, the delayed implementation of regular

formula based price revisions of fuel and electricity

and legacy issues related to inefficiencies and low

productivity have made SOBEs financially weak,

thus burdening the government coffers as well as the

entire banking system. As a result of such sustained

financing over the years, the exposure of the banking

system to the public sector has increased notably

posing risks to the stability of the financial system.

Moreover, rising public sector borrowing requirements

have also exerted upward pressures on market

interest rates, while excessive public sector financing

is likely to be inflationary. Sizeable funds obtained

by the Government through monetary financing

and by SOBEs in the form of borrowings, without

any commensurate improvement in productivity

and output, will exert upward pressures on prices.

This would, therefore, impale the effectiveness

of monetary policy, particularly at times when the

monetary policy stance is tight. Some of the recent

remedial measures outlined previously in this Chapter

are likely to reduce the public sector's reliance on

the banking system. Meanwhile, further measures

could be taken to enhance public sector finances

and reduce the need for excessive bank financing.

A performance driven public sector would increase

productivity and enhance financial feasibility, thereby

lessening the need for bank financing. Meanwhile,

leveraging on the improved domestic macroeconomic

conditions and the country standing, the Government

should actively engage in securing low cost funding

53

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

from other bilateral and multilateral creditors, thereby

reducing their dependency on the domestic banking

system for funding. Also, SOBEs should seek other

sources of financing, perhaps even foreign financing

in the form of investment and project based financing,

no sooner than when multilateral fundings open up to

the Government. Alternatively, the Government could

consider transforming loss-making, yet strategic,

SOBEs into profit centres through public-private

partnership (PPP) arrangements, which would bring

in the management expertise of the private sector,

thereby enhancing the productivity and profitability

of such SOBEs. Further, reducing undue wastage

and corruption in the public sector and appointing

qualified and capable officials with experience and

expertise in those respective fields is necessary.

As a result of these measures, the public sector’s

continued dependency on the domestic banking

system would subside, thereby providing greater

space and opportunity for such scarce funds in the

banking system to be utilised for productive activities

of the private sector.

Recent experiences of growing vulnerabilities

in the food supply systems in Sri Lanka due to

ad hoc policy interventions reiterate the need for

strong commitment of the Government towards

a coordinated and consistent policy approach

to resolve issues in the domestic agriculture

sector and ensure food security of the country.

Despite the continuous support extended by

successive governments to the agriculture sector in

terms of subsidies, especially the fertiliser subsidy,

guaranteed prices, supply of high yielding varieties

as well as agriculture extension services in the

past several decades with a view to promoting

its productivity, the country’s agriculture sector

productivity remains stagnant and vulnerable to both

climatic and manmade shocks. While provisioning

of fertiliser subsidies remains a crucial intervention

in the agricultural sector, it has become a highly

politically sensitive matter in the country, thereby

forcing successive governments to continue such

policies irrespective of the outcome yielded from

such policies. Accordingly, there is a growing need

to adopt a sustainable and efficient fertiliser policy

to prevent the excessive use of chemical fertiliser

and promote organic farming, while reducing the

burden on the country’s import bill. Yet, the abrupt

ban on chemical fertiliser importation in 2021 had

devastating impacts on staple food production in the

country, almost leading to a food crisis in 2022, which

was further exacerbated by limited food imports

amidst the dearth of foreign exchange liquidity.

Nevertheless, after being in force for six months, the

fertiliser ban was revoked in identifying the need for

the gradual phasing out of inorganic fertiliser use in

agriculture. Although policies on price controls could

play a significant role in ensuring that food remains

affordable and accessible to everyone, price controls

implemented by the Government showed limited

success in easing food price pressures in Sri Lanka

amidst the food shortages in 2022, reflecting the lack

of coordination among stakeholders and absence of

resilient buffer stocks to avert price pressures as

well as rising cost elements of food supply resulted

from the economic crisis. The government paddy

purchasing programme, which was carried out

during late 2022 to purchase paddy at higher prices

to support the farmers, failed to deliver envisaged

outcome due to the lack of funds with the Paddy

Marketing Board. Further, the ban on use of paddy

or rice in animal feed production, which aimed

at ensuring the high availability of rice for human

consumption, had adverse consequences on the

poultry sector with limited availability of imported

animal feeds. This may have partially contributed to

the exorbitant increase in prices for poultry products,

in turn affecting the quality of diets, which is a major

aspect of food security in the country. Although the

Government introduced maximum prices for poultry

products to ensure their affordability to the public,

resultant poultry product shortage in the market

raised concerns about availability. Drawing attention

54

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

1

to lapses of ad hoc and fragmented policymaking

for the agriculture sector, Sri Lanka’s recent

experiences show that many of the agricultural

policies implemented have been counterproductive.

Although Sri Lanka was not fully self sufficient in

food, the country was not severely threatened by

issues of food security in recent decades, in terms

of food availability, affordability, accessibility and

stability. Due to successive loss or reduced harvest

of paddy and vegetables following ad hoc policies

adopted during 2021-2022, Sri Lanka experienced

a food insecurity situation which is being continued

to date at a lower scale. This problem needs to be

addressed in consultation with the farmer community

and remedied as early as possible given the critical

importance of food requirements of the country. The

farming community need to be made aware of the

proposed policies of the Government and be trained

on agricultural adaptations. This alarming status

of the agricultural sector demands a holistic and

sustainable strategy for the agricultural sector with

enhanced coordination among all agriculture related

government institutions, private sector stakeholders,

and farmers to reorient agricultural sector to

effectively facilitate development and ensure

food security. Such broad-based policy approach

should be targeted at solving deep rooted issues

of low agriculture productivity, high post-harvest

losses, suboptimal agriculture practices, poor value

addition, price distortions, and weak marketability

of the agriculture produce, thereby enabling the

formation of a sustainable agriculture sector that is

capable of generating healthy income levels for the

stakeholders in the agriculture value chain, while

ensuring food security and efficient ecosystem

management of the country.

Expediting the long overdue factor market

reforms remains vital in accelerating economic

recovery in the aftermath of the crisis and

fostering growth over the medium term. Land

and labour markets of the country continued to

face challenges and limitations with the inflexibility

of policies and inadequacy of law enforcement

in such areas, which have impeded the country's

ability to seize emerging opportunities in the global

market and obstructed the smooth inflow of FDIs.

In the labour market, existing laws and regulations

tend to favour the protection of employees. This

could have a negative impact on both utilisation

and productivity of the workforce. Meanwhile, public

sector employment offers attractive employment

benefits with a non-contributory pension scheme,

which discourages the movement of labour

towards more productive sectors and activities.

Further, persistent rigidities in the labour market,

such as absence of flexible working hours and

compressed work hours, gender barriers, lack of

performance based remuneration packages, skill

gaps in the labour force, etc., have largely impacted

employability and labour productivity in the country

during the past several decades. Therefore, urgent

action is needed to modernise and liberalise

labour market laws and regulations in line with

international labour standards, in order to facilitate

the revival of the Sri Lankan economy. Within this

framework, major policy areas for improving labour

market functionality include reducing the cost of

severance and making job termination/switching

easier, enhancing temporary employment, providing

flexibility in minimum and statutory retirement ages,

aligning the retirement age with life expectancy, and

increasing the employability of females. At the same

time, these regulations should encompass emerging

areas of employment to match contemporary

requirements, while necessary impetus, such as

unemployment insurance schemes, flexible working

hours, safe public transport, and daycare/childcare,

should be encouraged to enhance female labour

force participation. Moreover, measures are needed

to control excessive human capital flight during

the crisis, and a review of existing immigration

rules is vital to attract global talent and address

skill gaps in the country’s labour market. It would

55

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

also be necessary to focus attention on internal

and external labour migration issues impacted

by the economic downturn, which may result in

unintended disruption to family life and migrant

health issues. The land market faces longstanding

bottlenecks due to various complexities, including

different levels of ownership systems created by

numerous land laws, the presence of multiple land

law enforcement agencies, differences in rules

followed by land management related agencies,

issues in land titles, and lengthy and inefficient

procedures to obtain approvals for utilisation of land

in projects. Streamlining the legal enforcements

pertinent to lands may contribute to simplifying

the existing complexities of the land market along

with the establishment of a centralised agency to

consolidate the functions of various institutions

under a single entity to streamline the process

and improve efficiency in managing unutilised/

unproductively used lands, and lands available

for development. Further, a centralised digital

database of land information that ensures clear and

unambiguous ownership may resolve inefficiencies

in the land allocation process by improving access

to land data, so as to facilitate investments in the

country. In this regard, the Government’s initiative

to establish an e-land registry is a commendable

effort that is expected to ensure convenient, safe,

and efficient registration of land, while providing

speedy access to land information and related

services to necessary parties including government

agencies, the private sector, and the general public.

Further, the development of a comprehensive land

use policy framework and strengthening of the

land administration systems are also critical for

the effective functioning of the land market in the

country. Therefore, expediting the implementation

of long overdue structural reforms in the labour

and land markets could enhance the allocation and

utilisation efficiencies in the factor market, thereby

boosting employment, investment, and the overall

growth momentum of the economy.

Sri Lanka has great potential to transform

its economy towards a digital economy, and

rapid adoption of developments on the global

digital front remains vital to unlock the gains

of the digital age to facilitate the envisaged

economic recovery. A digital economy represents

a technology driven economic paradigm, where

digital technologies are leveraged to improve

economic activity, resulting in economy wide

efficiencies and growth achieved through increased

connectivity and transparency, enhanced

convenience for the public, greater efficiency in

resource allocation, and real time access to data,

enabling evidence based policy responses and

speeding up development. The digital economy in

Sri Lanka is on a gradual rise, witnessing notable

strides in software and IT services, e-government

services, and fintech via the development of digital

infrastructure, with many global companies setting

up operations in the field, creating fresh prospects

for innovation and entrepreneurship. Moreover, the

COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption

of digital technology and many businesses and

individuals turning to online platforms for work

and communication. In addition, e-government

services have enabled better citizen engagement

and increased transparency and accountability,

while fintech has offered opportunities for innovative

financial services, promoting financial inclusion.

Meanwhile, digital inclusion in Sri Lanka witnessed

a progressive transformation with various initiatives

aimed at providing affordable internet connectivity and

digital literacy training to underserved communities

across the country. The Government’s initiative

of the National Digital Transformation Strategy

(2021-2024), which is based on the three pillars of

Digital Government, Digital Economy, and Digital

Services, remains a commendable effort in this

regard. Meanwhile, the enactment of the Personal

Data Protection Act, No. 9 of 2022 and initiatives

taken to establish a Data Protection Authority,

as announced in the Budget 2023, are essential

56

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

ingredients for digital transformation. Although

Sri Lanka has made progress in digitalising the

economy, the digital transformation of the country is

still in its early stage of development, compared to

peer economies, as reflected by the Digital Quality

of Life (DQL) Index, where Sri Lanka ranked 89th

out of 117 countries in 2022 based on various

criteria, including internet affordability, internet

quality, e-government, e-security, and e-commerce.

To gather digitalisation momentum, there are still

challenges to be overcome with significant room for

improvement in many areas. Accordingly, Sri Lanka

must pursue its efforts to invest in digital infrastructure,

promote digital literacy and skills development to

address the digital divide, and create a supportive

regulatory environment that encourages innovation,

technology transfer and foreign investment, to

fast-track progress. Digitalisation provides an

opportunity for Sri Lanka to address structural

bottlenecks in its economy, such as poor targeting

of people under safety nets, challenges in tax

administration and monitoring, inefficiencies in supply

channels, barriers to marketing, and coordination and

transparency issues within the government sector,

while creating numerous prospects for productivity

improvement in the human capital of the economy.

Further, digitalisation enhances accessibility and

facilitates integration into global value chains,

ultimately bolstering the country's ability to seize

market opportunities and drive economic recovery

in the period ahead. Although the Government is

driving digital transformation, the private sector bears

a significant responsibility in digital development.

This includes investments, innovation, technology

transfer and human capital development aimed at

bridging various levels of the digital divide to promote

widespread digital usage within the society, in line

with the evolution of technologies. Accordingly, a

multifaceted, coordinated, and consistent policy

approach, with active collaboration among all

stakeholders including the Government, regulators,

legal authorities, and the private sector, is crucial

in developing secure and reliable digital systems,

which are expected to bridge the current digital

divide, while simultaneously generating positive

spillovers to other clusters of economic activities. It

would also be necessary to enact the cyber security

law, which would help frame appropriate rules and

regulations to safeguard the wider financial system.

Striving towards rising from the economic

crisis and strategising for stability and growth

are essential, yet due regard to preserving the

environment is also vital for ensuring sustainable

growth. Longstanding environmental issues, such

as deforestation, the human-elephant conflict, illegal

mining, unorganised garbage dumping, carbon

emissions, and crop losses due to wildlife and

weather disruptions, have many socio-economic

reverberations. Evidence shows that Sri Lanka has

experienced a significant temperature rise, while

annual precipitation and consecutive dry days

have also increased in the recent decades. Several

international studies have also identified Sri Lanka

as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate

change. The economy has suffered significantly from

climate related issues in the past two decades, such as

floods, droughts, erratic rainfall patterns, heat waves,

landslides, and pest outbreaks. Rising temperatures

and ocean acidification affect fish availability, which is

an important source of proteins for our citizens, while

also earning export incomes. Loss of food supply in

turn leads to inflation, low welfare of the rural farmer

community, having to expend scarce foreign currency

on food importation, and loss of export income from

agricultural products. The effects of climate change

on energy generation have been severe, considering

Sri Lanka’s high dependence on hydropower

(33.7 per cent in 2022) and recent changes in

rain patterns. This issue is severe when global

oil prices are high, given Sri Lanka’s persistent

foreign currency deficiency and energy insecurity.

Further, over 2 million metric tonnes of coal are

imported for energy generation annually because

57

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

of the inability to increase the share of fuel oils

used to generate electricity due to foreign currency

shortages. Adverse climate, natural disasters, and

pollution have a negative impact on tourism, which

is an industry that Sri Lanka is unfortunately heavily

reliant on. The Government and the Central Bank

have been taking several initiatives, lately, to support

the environmental preservation drive, reduce the

adverse impact on the environment from economic

activities and direct fund flow to activities that support

environmental preservation. The Central Bank

worked with the International Finance Corporation

of the World Bank to create a Sustainable Finance

Roadmap and Taxonomy. A Climate Prosperity

Plan was recently launched. Improving the country’s

economic resilience is also needed to make

investments to improve environmental resilience.

Comprehensive, centralised periodic reporting about

the environment, covering all aspects of the

environment, such as climate, atmospheric warming,

forest cover, wildlife, mineral resources, pollution,

etc., needs to be made available to the public by

an identified authority. It can improve awareness

among people about environmental concerns,

and effectively coordinate policy actions. Foreign

investments and grants should be enticed in relation

to environmentally friendly projects and environment

conservations that would have positive spillovers

on several sectors, such as renewable energy,

water management, and garbage management,

among others. Domestic financial institutions should

be encouraged to fund green and blue projects for

sustainable and inclusive growth. Showcasing the

consciousness of environmental protection would

unlock several concessional financing options from

multilateral, bilateral, and responsible private sector

donors, which would be appealing in the country’s

current effort to restore debt sustainability. In the

long run, innovative steps to increase environmental

accountability, such as Green Gross Domestic

Product, a GDP calculation that makes adjustments for

environmental damage caused, need to be explored.

Sustainable recovery of growth hinges

on undertaking much needed reforms

expeditiously in key areas of the economy, while

benefiting from the ongoing debt restructuring

efforts. Evidence on the possible impact of debt

restructuring on a country’s growth prospects in

the post-debt restructuring period is mixed. The

process of debt restructuring can be associated

with negative economic effects, such as worsening

investor and business confidence, lack of access

to commercial credit, higher borrowing costs

associated with low sovereign rating, and reduced

government spending. However, debt restructuring

can help to reduce government borrowing in the

medium term and increase the availability of credit

for private sector investment, which can have a

positive growth impact. Economic growth remains

a major factor in the post-debt restructuring period

as it affects the ability of a country to pay its debt

obligations, even after restructuring. When a

country fails to revive its economic growth, it may

be more difficult for it to meet its debt obligations

and to sustain the benefits of debt reprofiling without

falling into similar debt unsustainability issues in

the post-restructuring period. The economic

performance of a country during the post-debt

restructuring period could fall below its potential

due to several factors: unfavourable economic

conditions, which could be due to both external

or domestic growth impediments; implementation

challenges, where reaching agreements with

creditors or successfully implementing the re-profiling

could be difficult; insufficient policy measures, in

particular, those aimed at supporting growth failing

to have the desired impact; and political instability,

the possibility of which could be high during a

debt crisis, and in turn could undermine investor

confidence. There are several examples of countries

that have implemented policies to support growth

after a sovereign debt restructuring, with varying

degrees of success. In Ireland, the Government

support growth after its debt restructuring in

2010, including tax cuts, increased government

spending, and structural reforms aimed at improving

competitiveness. These measures, along with the

recovery in the global economy and the rebound

in the technology sector, helped boost demand

and support economic growth. Another example is

Ecuador that implemented a series of policies aimed

at boosting growth, including increased government

spending, investment in infrastructure, and targeted

social spending programmes. These actions helped

stimulate demand and support economic growth

after the restructuring, although the country has

faced challenges in maintaining fiscal sustainability

in recent years. Despite facing a range of economic,

political, and social challenges, Sri Lanka has

demonstrated a remarkable ability to bounce back

and recover from setbacks. This resilience is due in

part to the country's strong cultural and social fabric,

as well as its highly educated and skilled workforce.

Sri Lanka's resilience is a testament to the strength

and resilience of its people and institutions and

provides a strong foundation for future growth

and development after debt restructuring. Yet,

several challenges remain in recovering growth

expeditiously. Firstly, Sri Lanka is facing its first

experience of defaulting on a selected range of debt

and engaging in the process of debt restructuring.

The lack of experience could be a shortcoming in

carefully planning and executing debt restructuring

and timely formulating post-restructuring strategies

for revival. Moreover, unlike many other countries,

Sri Lanka’s status is much more complex. Public

debt unsustainability and the resulting preemptive

default are coupled with many other instabilities

and difficulties, including a BOP crisis, escalated

inflation, notably weakened currency, social unrest,

and political turmoil. The measures already taken

and envisaged to address this multifaceted crisis are

not aimed at growth promotion, but rather focused

on restoring macroeconomic stability. Hence,

in parallel to progressing on debt restructuring,

it is vital for the Government to devise a growth

enhancement vision with the assistance of external

and domestic stakeholders. Financing assistance

from the IMF and other multilateral agencies would

be instrumental in building a strong foundation for

regaining confidence in Sri Lanka. Ongoing reforms

and restructuring of the state sector and SOEs would

help enhance productivity and efficiency in this

sector, while also indirectly supporting the private

sector. Fighting corruption and improving adherence

to law and order are also essential enablers, the

demand for which however needs to originate

from the wider society, and it would undoubtedly

improve the doing business environment and

thereby the attractiveness of the country as an

investment destination. Formation and consistent

execution of national policies across key sectors,

such as agriculture, industry, international trade,

and investment policies would be growth positive.

Debt restructuring would undoubtedly create the

much needed space for the Sri Lankan economy to

regain stability. However, sustaining this space and

reaching its economic potential would be the key to

reaping the full benefit of this historic moment.

In this context, while acknowledging the

measures already taken to address some of the

issues highlighted over the years, concerted

efforts should be taken by the Government,

relevant authorities, and policymakers to

formulate strategies to address and overcome

other long-standing structural issues to ensure

the economy makes a gradual and sustainable

economic recovery. It is imperative that all

stakeholders in the economy realise that the IMF-EFF

supported programme alone will not be a panacea

to the issues that the country is grappling with at

this time. Rather, the country needs to make use

of this opportunity to rectify and remedy the legacy

missteps by implementing the required reforms with

the support of all stakeholders, thereby preventing

the need for recurring bailout programmes.

Therefore, fervent efforts and perseverance by all

stakeholders are required to initiate and institute

the necessary fiscal and SOBE reforms, improve

the country’s growth potential, restore and ensure

price and financial stability while rebuilding external

buffers, restore public debt sustainability, and most

importantly reduce corruption while supporting

vulnerable groups through appropriate social

safety net schemes. In this process, it is up to

all stakeholders, including the public, to remain

informed about what is best for the country, and

collectively ensure that the aforesaid pillars of

reform are not reneged for short term political gains.

This would ensure that the economy makes steady

progress in the journey towards sustainable growth,

while safeguarding the country’s macroeconomic

stability.
