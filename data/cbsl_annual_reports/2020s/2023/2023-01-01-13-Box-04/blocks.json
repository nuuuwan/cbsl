    "text": "National Accounts estimates are among the critical inputs in economic analyses as well as in policymaking as they reflect the real sector developments of an economy. Therefore, it is essential to accommodate the changes in the economic and price structures of an economy over time to the National Accounts estimates through regular rebasing exercises. Fulfilling this requirement, the base year of Sri Lankan National Accounts estimates has been revised from time to time, to 1958, 1963, 1975, 1990, 2002, 2010 in history, and the latest to 2015. The Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), as the official compiler, updated the base year of National Accounts estimates to 2015, replacing the previous base year of 2010. Alongside the latest rebasing exercise, DCS expanded the production boundary and broadened the coverage of economic activities while some improvements were made to the compilation methodologies.",

One of the major coverage expansions is the inclusion of reclamation work relating to the Colombo International Financial City (CIFC) project into the Industry activities, which were carried out during the period from 2014 to 2018, taking into account the percentage of work done in each year. This led to considerable fluctuations in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) estimates and the corresponding GDP growth rates during the period 2014-2019. The coverage of several Agriculture and Services activities was also broadened during this rebasing exercise. Along with these coverage improvements, the rebased GDP estimates related to the Production Approach were disseminated under 49 economic activities, instead of 48 economic activities under the 2010 series. This is attributable to the estimation of plant propagation and agricultural supporting activities separately under the new base year.
