"specified in clause 10 above, the DDP shall be deemed to be in default for the full sum so outstanding and shall become liable"

"business day based on the official prices relevant for the next business day. If the revalued amount is higher than the total"
"amount of default and default interest, the CBSL will repay the excess amount to the credit of the DDP’s settlement account in"

"in addition to the right to charge default interest as stipulated in this clause. In the event of repeated default, the CBSL may"
"withdraw the availability of the ILF to the DDP for a period of time determined by the CBSL."
"17.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of the ILF agreement or Operating Instructions and notwithstanding the fact that default"
"has  not  occurred  more  than  once  within  the  preceding  30-day  period,  the  CBSL  may,  at  its  sole  discretion,  taking  into"
"consideration the circumstances of a default, decide to retain the securities, and to deal with them as the CBSL deems fit."
