    "text": "The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) that emerged mid 2007 caused revived concerns about the need for ensuring financial system stability and a renewed focus on the fundamental role of central banks in managing and preventing systemic crises. In response to the turmoil caused by GFC, central banks around the world used both new and existing tools to supply liquidity to financial institutions and markets extensively. During 2022, the Sri Lankan economy experienced the most severe economic crisis since its independence from the British in 1948. The crisis had an impact on the financial system of the country, increasing the risks and vulnerabilities of the financial system. The domestic money market encountered multidimensional challenges that arose from adverse macroeconomic conditions in the country. Money market liquidity conditions continued to be at deficit levels, while witnessing a significant asymmetry in the distribution of liquidity among market participants due to adherence to stringent counterparty limits. Consequently, market participants excessively resorted to central bank facilities to manage liquidity, requiring an active financial intermediary role from the Central Bank. As such, the Central Bank took remedial measures to exercise its role in providing liquidity through appropriate tools to ensure monetary and financial stability. This article aims to enhance the awareness and understanding of the Central Bank\u2019s policy interventions in addressing the systemic liquidity issues during stress periods to ensure monetary and financial stability in Sri Lanka.",

The prime objective of central bank liquidity management is to regulate the level of aggregate reserves in the banking system to assist the realisation of the policy objectives through steering short term interest rates and the continued functioning of the payments system. Hence, central bank liquidity remains an important variable in facilitating the process of monetary policy implementation, as market interest rates and credit creation are closely related to liquidity. However, in a broader perspective, active liquidity management is more or less related to all core functions within the mandate of the central bank in achieving both price and financial system stability. While it plays an important role in the implementation of monetary policy, the smooth functioning of the payments system and safeguarding of financial system stability also remains vital. Accordingly, monetary policy tools of a central bank used in liquidity management aim to curtail the swings in liquidity and price of money (interest rates), which has an impact on the both objectives of the central bank.",

The standing facility is a typical example of this type of transaction that can take place as and when required by a financial institution based on the availability of the funding liquidity. For example, the Standing Lending Facility (SLF) of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka provides liquidity directly to a particular financial institution to fulfill residual funding needs when conditions in the interbank money market are tightened, or a particular financial institution faces short term funding pressures. Similarly, if a financial institution possesses excess funds at the day end, such excess can be parked at the Central Bank using the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) and earn an interest income. These tools are considered as the conventional tools that the Central Bank uses in liquidity management. Aside from the use of conventional tools and liquidity facilities, financial crises and market uncertainty induce central banks to expand their toolkits for conducting liquidity operations and supplying central bank liquidity to financial institutions and financial markets.",

However, market liquidity conditions continued to be at deficit levels and started witnessing a systemic liquidity shortage caused by asymmetric liquidity distribution among market participants. As the systemic shortage is an aggregate shortage of liquidity situation, as opposed to institution specific shortages, most banking institutions find it challenging to fulfill the Central Bank liquidity requirement (reserve requirement) simultaneously. Such a market-wide stress situation, together with low activity in the interbank money market, could lead to potential financial and macroeconomic stability implications. As banks play an important role in financing the economy and being a key intermediary in the payments and settlements system of the economy, the failure of one bank to fulfill funding liquidity may potentially cause blockages in the entire payments and settlements system and lead to otherwise preventable failures of financial institutions through possible bank runs. Due to the interconnectivity amongst banks and other financial institutions, there can be contagion and spillover effects that could ultimately have widespread implications on financial system stability and public confidence as well as significant implications on the real economy. Hence, considering prolonged systemic liquidity shortages, which posed a threat to financial instability and the Central Bank\u2019s role in preventing and managing a systemic crisis, the Central Bank used a wide range of conventional and unconventional liquidity management tools to ensure both monetary and financial stability.",

At the same time, it has been observed that several Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) have continued to depend excessively on the overnight standing facilities under OMOs of the Central Bank, without considering market based funding options to address their funding liquidity needs. Such LCBs have not indicated any signs of taking remedial actions to reduce the over dependency on overnight facilities offered by the Central Bank, which are available to be used as fallback options after utilising all other funding options.

    "text": "As a part of the policy toolkit to prepare for the possible systemic risk of the banking sector, the Central Bank strengthened the ELA framework. As per Section 86 of the MLA, in periods of emergency or of imminent financial panic, which directly threaten monetary and banking stability, the Central Bank is allowed to grant extraordinary loans or advances to banking institutions. Accordingly, ELA is an extraordinary loan or advance that the Central Bank uses to provide liquidity to address idiosyncratic (institutional specific) shocks that affect one or a few individual banking institutions. The principal objective of ELA is to avoid the risk that temporary illiquidity leads to insolvency and to mitigate the contagion and spillover effects. When a banking institution faces difficulties in fulfilling funding liquidity, it may lead to a failure of banking institutions. Hence, apart from conducting liquidity management provisions to steer short term interest rates under monetary policy, the Central Bank facilitates ELA to banking institutions as an exceptional means of providing central bank liquidity for banking institutions facing temporary liquidity issues. Accordingly, under the above legal provisions, any banking institution that is considered to be solvent but is facing a temporary illiquid position, is entitled to the ELA facility against a wide array of collaterals at the discretion of the Central Bank to strengthen its liquidity position. This facility is available at a fixed interest rate, generally referred to as the Bank Rate, which is determined using AWNDR, with a margin, at present. Accordingly, this facility is granted to a banking institution using a unique ability to create liquidity in the form of central bank reserves and as a core responsibility of central banks being a Lender of Last Resort (LOLR). Further, banking institutions shall ensure adherence to strict conditions in terms of banking operations, which leads to reduced moral hazards and protects the central bank from losses that could compromise its independence or interfere with its ability to undertake monetary policy.2",

    "text": "Central bank liquidity management activities are related to all essential functions within the central bank mandate. It creates an important pillar for the transmission of monetary policy, the smooth functioning of the payments and settlements system and for protecting financial system stability. Without any doubt, in ensuring financial system stability, the central bank liquidity provision played a vital role in responding to the liquidity crisis faced by the country during its worst economic crisis since independence. In managing unprecedented challenges to the banking and financial system, the Central Bank is compelled to utilise innovative tools to prevent potential liquidity stress depending on domestic money market conditions. In this context, conventional and standard liquidity management tools ensure steering short term interest rates at a level in line with the monetary policy stance, to achieve the objective of price stability. Further, the Central Bank uses unconventional liquidity management tools effectively and in a timely manner to stabilise financial markets alleviating possible significant systemic risks, even in extremely tight liquidity conditions without a significant impact on the strength of the balance sheet of the Central Bank.",
