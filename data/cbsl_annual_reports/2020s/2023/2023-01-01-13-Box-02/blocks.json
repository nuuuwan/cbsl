    "text": "The Sri Lankan economy has been experiencing frequent incidences of vulnerabilities and instability conditions instilled by structural macroeconomic problems coupled with global and domestic shocks. The conditions weakened drastically since 2020 with the onset of the pandemic, along with ad-hoc policy changes that exacerbated stresses in the economy. As a result, the country experienced severe Balance of Payments (BOP) distress and subsequently multiple crises in 2022. Several policy interventions were rolled out since early 2022 to guide the economy towards greater stability. Seeking financial assistance subject to macroeconomic stabilisation and related commencement of debt restructuring efforts to restore public debt sustainability are key steps that have been taken towards this journey. Before 2022, Sri Lanka had entered into numerous International Monetary Fund (IMF) programmes from time to time for various purposes including supporting the BOP and the Government\u2019s reform agenda. However, unlike on previous occasions, Sri Lanka initiated discussions with the IMF in early 2022 for an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement under the direst economic conditions. The success of policy interventions was constrained by debt overhang as well as persistently large fiscal and BOP financing needs. Amidst continuous downgrades in sovereign ratings, Sri Lanka was cut off from avenues for external financing, making new fundraising and servicing existing loans extremely challenging. Usable reserves depleted to near zero levels, the exchange rate depreciated at an unprecedented scale, access to fuel, electricity and other essential imported items by the public was limited, general price levels escalated to new heights with demand pressures and supply shortages, financial system stability was under threat, and social and political clashes were recurring in early 2022. Against this backdrop, the need for economic stabilisation with external assistance was required and the Sri Lankan authorities initiated discussions with the IMF. Continuous engagements over a year with the IMF staff team on the finalisation of the proposed economic and financial policies and successful completion of prescribed prior actions under the programme and the receipt of financial assurances from the official creditors enabled the approval of an EFF in late March 2023. Salient features of this economic adjustment programme, expected developments under the EFF arrangement, the country\u2019s commitment to the reforms in the ensuing period, and necessity of continuing this programme over four years are discussed briefly in the following sections.",

A CPC applies to the non-accumulation of new external payments arrears on external debt which will be monitored continuously by the authorities and any non-observance will be immediately reported to the IMF. In addition, another QPC includes the prohibition of imposing or intensifying restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, introducing or modifying multiple currency practices, concluding bilateral payment agreements that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the IMF\u2019s Articles of Agreement, and imposing or intensifying import restrictions for BOP purposes. A monetary policy consultation clause (MPCC) has also been included to monitor year-on-year inflation on specified target dates to ensure that Sri Lanka is moving on a steady disinflation path to reach the targeted level to restore price stability. Further, ITs have been specified mainly on central government tax revenue,",

The structural reforms are anticipated to boost the competitiveness of the economy, provide a foundation for productivity enhancement, increase the efficiency in resource utilisation, and thereby enhance the growth potential. The severity of the current economic crisis faced by Sri Lanka highlights the importance of addressing the longstanding structural issues in a sustainable manner beyond the reforms agenda in the IMF programme through national policies which are formulated in consultation with stakeholders and free from political influences with vested interests. In this regard, the reforms agenda should focus on improving the productivity and output of the economy through technological innovations and increased economic connectivity to the world over trade and investment, by enhancing diversity in merchandise exports and potential services export sectors including tourism, IT/BPO sectors, and attracting FDI. It is also necessary to strengthen legal frameworks to ensure public accountability of state institutions, exercising available legal powers in policy formulation and implementation by relevant authorities to ensure lasting economic welfare in the country. These would complement the reforms agenda in the IMF-EFF arrangement to ensure that Sri Lanka attains and sustains macroeconomic stability in the earliest possible timeframe.",

This has been mainly due to the lack of commitment to meeting the conditionalities attached to such programmes, especially those related to structural reforms, which required painful macroeconomic adjustments and unpopular policies that were aimed at long term welfare enhancements. Therefore, it is imperative that Sri Lanka internalises these reforms in its policy formulation and implements the major areas of reforms in the current IMF programme as well as reforms beyond the programme to help the economy transform into greater stability and a higher growth path at the earliest while circumventing the need for repeated access to IMF bailouts and several rounds of debt restructuring in the future.",
