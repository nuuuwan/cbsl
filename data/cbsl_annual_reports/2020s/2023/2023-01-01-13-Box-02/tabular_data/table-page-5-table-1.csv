Restoring  price  stability:  The  Central  Bank 
expected to restore price stability by driving inflation 
in a steady disinflation path to bring it back to the 
targeted range under the Flexible Inflation Targeting 
(FIT) framework through appropriate monetary policy 
actions. As a part of this process, monetary financing

price  stability  commitment  also  entails  maintaining 
more flexibility in the exchange rate and rebuilding

Strengthening 
financial system stability: The IMF is of the view 
that Sri Lanka’s financial system is heavily exposed to 
the public sector, moderately capitalised, and could 
face material capital and forex shortfalls following 
a  debt 
possibility that banks could face significant capital 
and forex shortfalls as a result of a sovereign debt 
restructuring.  Therefore,  plans  are  under  way  for 
the capital restoration of systemic banks following 
asset quality reviews to strengthen the resilience of 
the state owned banks. Meanwhile, financial sector 
supervision and the crisis management framework 
will be strengthened to make Sri Lanka’s financial 
system more robust.
In addition to these specific benefits, the IMF supported 
programme  would  bring  several  positive  spillovers  to 
the  economy  through  improved  investor  confidence, 
possible  sovereign  rating  upgrades,  and  reopening
