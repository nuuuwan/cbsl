against each currency. 
(b)   The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) is a weighted average of nominal exchange rates of 24 trading partner and competitor 
countries. Weights are based on the trade shares reflecting the relative importance of each currency in each of the currency baskets. 
The Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) is computed by adjusting the NEER for inflation differentials with respect to each currency in the  
basket. A minus sign indicates depreciation. CCPI was used for REER computation.
(c) 
 The exchange rate has been defined in terms of indices so that the appreciation/depreciation of the rupee relative to other currencies is 
directly reflected by a rise/fall in the values of the effective exchange rate indices, respectively.","","",""
