5.1 OverviewS

ri Lanka’s external sector faced unprecedented challenges in 2022 with severe Balance of Payments

(BOP) pressures, amidst dwindling gross official reserves (GOR), large depreciation of the

exchange rate, and the dearth of foreign exchange liquidity in the domestic market, among others.

The shortage of liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market constrained the importation of essential

imports, such as petroleum oil, cooking gas, medicines, fertiliser, among others, thereby heightening social

tensions and causing political instability. Significant policy intervention was warranted to stem the persistent

negative spillovers across economic activity, including the sharp tightening of monetary policy, suspension of

servicing of selected external debt for an interim period from mid-April 2022, temporary suspension of certain

imports and payment terms, imposition of margin deposit requirements on selected imports, and capital flow

management measures. Sri Lanka commenced negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)

for an economic adjustment programme in April 2022, for which the staff level agreement was reached in

September 2022, and the approval of the Executive Board of the IMF was received in March 2023. The

Government initiated measures to restructure the public debt aimed to ensuring public debt sustainability as

part of the process of securing the IMF funding. The Government and the Central Bank were compelled to

resort to drawing down on GOR in order to facilitate the importation of essential commodities, while continuing

the debt service payments unaffected by the temporary suspension amidst modest foreign financing inflows

and highly unfavourable credit ratings. The assistance received from multilateral development partners and

friendly nations by way of humanitarian credit lines and grants helped facilitate the provisioning of essential

commodities. Meanwhile, a measured adjustment of the exchange rate was allowed by the Monetary Board

in early March 2022, in view of the heightened pressures in the domestic foreign exchange market. However,

the subsequent floating of the exchange rate caused a large depreciation due to the dearth of liquidity in

the domestic foreign exchange market and unfavourable market sentiments. The Central Bank commenced

providing market guidance on the spot exchange

rate by publishing a middle rate and a variation

margin in mid-May 2022 that helped stabilise the

exchange rate from significant intraday volatility.

The external current account deficit moderated

notably in 2022, mainly led by significant

contraction in the trade deficit with import

expenditure reducing sharply due to restrictive

trade policies, sharp depreciation of the exchange

rate and tight monetary and fiscal conditions

that were necessary to manage pressures in the

external sector. Merchandise exports increased,

mainly driven by an increase in industrial exports,

including apparel, among others. The surplus in

the trade in services account increased to some

extent due to the increase in earnings from tourism,

while inflows to almost all other services sector

subcategories recorded a notable decline during

the year. Further, workers’ remittances improved

significantly towards the second half of 2022, while

the deficit in the primary income account recorded

a marginal moderation compared to that of 2021.

Inflows to the financial account remained modest

during the year.

Following the historically high depreciation

recorded in 2022, the Sri Lanka rupee showed

some appreciation in early 2023, thereby correcting

the large overshooting to some extent. This

appreciation was mainly supported by improved

market sentiments towards the finalisation of the

IMF-EFF arrangement, improvements in liquidity

conditions of the domestic foreign exchange

market, and the relaxation and subsequent

removal of the mandatory sales requirement of

foreign exchange by the licensed banks to the

Central Bank. With the envisaged macroeconomic

stability and easing of BOP pressures, external

sector activity, including trade in goods and

services, and workers’ remittances is expected to

normalise in the period ahead. This would help

improve the external current account balance

sustainably, thereby facilitating the buildup of

GOR in the period ahead. The gradual buildup of

GOR and stabilisation of the exchange rate, the

receipt of additional financing from development

partners, along with the successful implementation

of the IMF-EFF supported programme, and the

completion of the debt restructuring process in

the near term are expected to bolster investor

confidence and improve the country’s credit

ratings, thereby further strengthening the stability

of the external sector in the period ahead.

5.2 Current Account Balance

The external current account deficit

narrowed in 2022, compared to 2021, with a

significant contraction in the merchandise

trade deficit, recovery in trade in services,

a slight moderation in the primary income

account deficit despite a contraction in the

surplus in the secondary income account.

The trade deficit contracted sharply during 2022

with the expansion of earnings from merchandise

exports and compression of expenditure on

merchandise imports, which mainly reflected

the impact of moderation of economic activity

and policy measures to curtail imports amidst

the severe BOP pressures. The increase in

exports earnings, which benefited from the

depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee against the

US dollar, was primarily reflected in categories

such as garments, machinery and mechanical

appliances, and gems, diamonds and jewellery.

Meanwhile, merchandise imports recorded a

notable reduction driven by a sizable contraction

in consumer goods and investment goods, while

importation of intermediate goods remained at

similar levels, compared to the previous year. The

reduction in imports was primarily due to several

measures introduced by the Government and

the Central Bank to prioritise essential imports

amidst the unprecedented shortage of foreign

currency liquidity in the banking system, as well

as the reduction in import demand associated with

the contraction of economic activity and increase

in import costs due to the sharp depreciation of

exchange rate. Concurrently, the surplus in the

services account recorded an increase, mainly

due to the recovery in earnings from tourism, as

domestic supply side disruptions faded away,

and global travel activity picked up significantly

with the easing of pandemic related concerns.

However, all other sectors in the services account,

including air and sea freight transportation, and

services inflows to the IT/BPO sector remained

significantly subdued, compared to the previous

year. The primary income account deficit

marginally moderated compared to the previous

year, due to higher interest income to the banking

sector as a result of increased international

interest rates and foreign asset positions of

banks, despite a marginal increase in outflows

from the primary income account. Meanwhile,

due to significantly high migration of Sri Lankan

workers in the latter part of 2022 and the resultant

large remittance inflows, workers’ remittances,

which were the main contributor to the secondary

income account, revived in the second half of

2022, but remained low, compared to 2021.

Overall, the current account deficit contracted to

US dollars 1,453 million in 2022 (1.9 per cent of

GDP), compared to US dollars 3,284 million (3.7

per cent of GDP) in 2021.

5.2.1 Merchandise Trade Account

Trade Balance

The lowest merchandise trade deficit since

2010 was recorded in 2022, contributing mainly

to the decline in the current account deficit for

2022. This reduction in the trade deficit to US dollars

5,185 million in 2022 from US dollars 8,139 million

in 2021 was due to both the significant decrease

in expenditure on merchandise imports and the

notable growth in earnings from merchandise

exports. The decline in import expenditure during

2022 was a result of multiple factors, including the

significant forex liquidity constraints in the domestic

forex market; impact of the sharp depreciation of

the Sri Lanka rupee against the US dollar; subdued

activity and aggregate demand conditions amidst

the large decline in credit to the private sector,

reflecting the high interest rates and deterioration

of real income amidst the acceleration of inflation;

and administrative measures to prioritise imports

due to BOP pressures. The notable growth in

export earnings was supported by the significant

depreciation of the exchange rate that increased

rupee income for exporters; prioritisation of

the import of inputs for export industries; high

commodity prices in the global market; high

demand for major export items, such as garments

during the first half of the year; and administrative

Export and Import Performance, Terms of Trade and Direction of Trade

Export Performance

Despite heightened global and domestic

challenges, merchandise exports recorded a

notable increase and surpassed US dollars

13 billion during 2022 supported mainly by

the favourable exchange rate, priority given

for export industries when sourcing imported

inputs and the rise of global commodity

prices. Accordingly, earnings from merchandise

exports reached US dollars 13,106 million in

2022, compared to US dollars 12,499 million

in 2021, recording a growth of 4.9 per cent. An

increase in the earnings of both industrial and

mineral exports contributed to this improvement,

while agricultural exports declined. The notable

depreciation of the exchange rate and the higher

demand in the global market, especially for

garments during most of 2022, the significant

improvement in exports of gems, diamonds and

jewellery, supported by efforts to streamline and

strengthen the procedures relating to the export of

gems, and exports of machinery and mechanical

appliances were the major contributors to this

increase in industrial exports. A moderation of

export earnings was observed from September

2022 across major export sectors amidst slowing

global demand due to subdued global activity,

particularly in major export markets of Sri Lanka.

As evident in the movements of export indices, the

increase in both volumes and prices contributed to

the increase in the overall export earnings. As a

percentage of GDP, export earnings improved to

17.0 per cent in 2022, compared to 14.1 per cent

in 2021.

Earnings from industrial exports, the major

contributor with a share of about 80 per cent

of total merchandise exports, grew by 7.9

per cent to US dollars 10,465 million in 2022,

compared to US dollars 9,702 million in 2021.

Textiles and garments exports continued to be

the dominant export earner, accounting for more

than 45 per cent of total exports, despite the

moderation of earnings towards the latter part of

2022. Earnings from exports of gems, diamonds,

and jewellery; and machinery and mechanical

appliances (mainly machinery and equipment

parts) also recorded a notable improvement in

2022. Earnings from petroleum product exports

increased, reflecting the impact of price effect

due to high crude oil prices, while the volume

of bunker and aviation fuel recorded a marginal

decline. Earnings from rubber products declined

in 2022 remaining below the level of US dollars

1 billion in 2021, due to the lower demand for

household rubber gloves amidst the diminishing

of COVID-19 risks. A decline was also recorded in

exports of food, beverages, and tobacco (mainly

animal or vegetable fats and oils) during 2022.

Agricultural exports registered a decline

in earnings resulting mainly from the lagged

effect of inadequate fertiliser availability, with

an overall contraction of 5.9 per cent in 2022,

compared to 2021. Earnings from tea exports

declined due to the larger drop in volumes, despite

the increase in prices on average. The lower export

earnings recorded by spices were driven both by

lower volumes (mainly pepper and cloves) and

lower prices (cinnamon). The decline in earnings

from coconut-related products was due to lower

kernel export prices. However, earnings from

minor agricultural products recorded a notable

increase during 2022, reflecting the impact of

higher export volumes of certain products. The

increase of areca nuts exports to India under the

free trade agreement and sesame seeds led this

growth in the minor agricultural products sector.

Mineral exports increased by 12.3 per cent to

US dollars 50 million in 2022, compared to the

previous year. Earnings from exports of titanium

ores mainly contributed to this improvement, while

almost all other subsectors under mineral exports

declined during 2022. Sri Lanka’s mineral exports

accounted for a small share of 0.4 per cent of total

exports in 2022.

Import Performance

Expenditure on merchandise imports

declined notably despite higher global oil

prices, reflecting the impact of the dearth of

foreign exchange amidst significant BOP

stresses, subdued demand conditions,

significant depreciation of the exchange

rate, and administrative measures to

prioritise imports, among others. Expenditure

on imports declined by 11.4 per cent to

of certain imports, suspension of certain imports

under various payment terms, imposition of import

license requirements, increase of import taxes on

certain goods, etc.) and the Central Bank (including

margin deposit requirements on certain goods and

maintaining tighter monetary and credit conditions).

However, prices of major commodities in the global

markets, including petroleum oil, remained elevated

during 2022, resulting in higher expenditure on

intermediate goods, led mainly by fuel imports.

Import expenditure of consumer goods showed a

rising trend towards the latter part of 2022, indicating

the impact of the relaxation of certain restrictions

by the Government and seasonal demand for

imports. The decline in import expenditure in 2022

over the last year was reflected in lower volumes,

despite the increase in unit value, as indicated by

the movements in indices of import volume and unit

value. However, as a percentage of GDP, import

expenditure increased marginally to 23.7 per cent

in 2022, compared to 23.3 per cent in 2021.

Import expenditure on food and beverages

declined at a slower pace of 3.5 per cent in

2022, compared to 2021, resulting from lower

import volumes despite higher global food

commodity prices. Imports of most main food

categories recorded a decline in 2022, compared

to the previous year, except cereals and milling

industry products (such as rice and wheat flour),

beverages and spices. The considerable decline in

the import volume of coconut oil in 2022 and the

higher statistical base in 2021 led to the decline

in expenditure on oils and fats imports in 2022.

Further, expenditure on dairy products, lentils and

sugar also declined in 2022 driven by lower import

volumes, despite increases in average import

prices. In contrast, expenditure on rice imports

increased significantly in 2022 by about 300

per cent over 2021, as a result of the drop in the

domestic production of rice since it was hampered

by fertiliser shortages.

Expenditure on non-food consumer goods

declined notably by 44.8 per cent, year-on-year,

to US dollars 1,205 million, led by the

considerable decline in the expenditure

on medical and pharmaceuticals and

telecommunication devices. Expenditure on

medical and pharmaceuticals declined significantly,

partly reflecting the statistical base effect of higher

expenditure on COVID-19 vaccines in 2021.

Further, imports of all other subsectors under the

non-food consumer goods category declined in

2022, compared to 2021, reflecting the impact

of measures taken to restrict non-urgent imports

by the Government and the Central Bank and the

acute shortage of foreign exchange that was

prevalent in the banking system during 2022,

among others.

Expenditure on investment goods imports

declined by 32.1 per cent, year-on-year, to US

dollars 3,030 million in 2022, recording the

lowest expenditure since 2010. The moderation

of economic activity, and measures introduced

to prioritise imports amidst significant foreign

exchange liquidity constraints, mainly contributed

to this decline in investment goods imports.

Significant declines in import expenditure in all

three main categories of investment goods, namely

machinery and equipment, building material,

and transport equipment, and most of their

subcategories, were observed in 2022, compared

to 2021. The decline in expenditure on machinery

and equipment was led by office machines (mainly

computers), machinery and equipment parts, and

telecommunication devices (mainly transmission

apparatus), while expenditure on electric motors

and generating sets increased. Iron and steel,

cement, and mineral products (mainly asbestos)

caused building material imports to decline, while

agricultural tractors, tankers and bowsers and

railway equipment drove the decline in expenditure

on transport equipment.

Import expenditure on intermediate goods,

which accounted for 68 per cent of total

imports, increased marginally due to higher

expenditure on fuel, despite broad-based

decline of most subcategories, arising from

lower economic activity. Accordingly, expenditure

on intermediate goods increased by 1.1 per cent to

5US dollars 12,439 million in 2022 in comparison

to 2021. Expenditure on fuel imports, the largest

import item in the import basket, increased mainly

due to the increase in import prices of all subsectors;

crude oil, refined petroleum (including LP gas) and

coal, although import volumes of all subsectors

declined, compared to the previous year, reflecting

the impact of demand management measures,

such as fuel rationing and the cost reflective price

adjustments. In line with the price movements in the

international market, the average price of crude oil

imports increased to US dollars 100.11 per barrel

in 2022 from US dollars 68.86 per barrel in 2021.

However, crude oil was imported intermittently,

resulting in the bulk of the petroleum requirement

of the country was fulfilled by importing refined

petroleum in 2022. Expenditure on fertiliser imports

exhibited a considerable increase in 2022 due to

the increase in average import prices, despite low

import volumes, compared to 2021. Meanwhile,

import expenditure on textiles and textile articles,

the second largest import item, broadly remained

unchanged in 2022, compared to 2021. In contrast,

import expenditure on most other subcategories

under intermediate goods declined with base metals

(mainly iron and steel) and wheat grain declining

the most. As a result of the above, expenditure on

non-fuel intermediate goods declined by 12.0 per

cent in 2022, compared to 2021.

Terms of Trade

The terms of trade, which is the ratio

of export prices to import prices, further

deteriorated in 2022, as the import price index

increased at a higher pace than the export

price index. The increases in the price indices

of all major categories of exports contributed to

the increase in export prices, while higher prices

of the importation of intermediate goods, led by

higher global fuel prices, mainly accounted for the

increase in the overall import price index. As such,

the terms of trade deteriorated by 11.6 per cent

to 86.1 index points in 2022, compared to 2021,

indicating that the amount of imports that can be

purchased from a unit of exports has declined.

The trade volumes contributed significantly

to the overall behaviour of export earnings

and import expenditure during 2022. The

volume indices for all main categories of exports

improved, except for agricultural exports, while

the import volume indices for all main categories

declined, resulting in a decline in the overall

expenditure during 2022.

Direction of Trade

Sri Lanka’s major trading partners broadly

remained unchanged, although total trade (both

exports and imports) with some major trading

partners declined in 2022, when compared

to 2021. In value terms, India continued to be

the major trading partner of Sri Lanka in 2022,

followed by the USA and China, all of which

together contributed to around 41 per cent of the

total trade of Sri Lanka. Total trade with India

exceeded US dollars 5.5 billion, mainly with the

utilisation of credit lines provided by India to

support imports and higher exports under the

free trade agreement, while trade with the USA

and China exceeded US dollars 3.5 billion each.

Total trade with China declined significantly in

2022, driven by a notable reduction in imports

from China partly due to supply chain disruptions

in China due to COVID-19 and lower imports of

consumer and investment goods amidst import

restrictions and subdued economic activity.

The UK, Malaysia, Germany, the UAE and

Singapore, were the other major trading

partners,accounting for more than US dollars 1

billion each in 2022. The geo-political tensions

between Russia and Ukraine resulted in the total

trade with Ukraine halving in 2022, compared to

2021, although total trade with Russia increased

during 2022, led by higher fuel imports. The major

country-wise trade balances in 2022 remained

almost unchanged, where notable trade surpluses

were recorded with the USA, the UK, Germany,

Italy, Netherlands, and Canada, while significant

trade deficits were recorded with India, China,

Malaysia, and Singapore. The direction of trade

remains broadly the same over a decade and Sri

Lanka may need to explore diversification to new

markets for exports, particularly in the region.

The USA and European countries remained

the major destinations for Sri Lankan exports,

accounting for nearly half of the total export

earnings in 2022. The USA continued to be the

single largest buyer of Sri Lankan exports, with

more than US dollars 3.3 billion worth of exports,

which accounted for 25.3 per cent of total exports,

followed by the UK (7.3 per cent), India (6.6 per cent),

Germany (5.7 per cent) and Italy (4.9 per cent).

In line with increased exports, earnings from

most destinations, including the top ten export

destinations of Sri Lanka (except Germany, Belgium

and Australia), increased during 2022. The USA

continued to be the single largest garment export

destination for Sri Lanka, with a share of 42 per cent

of total garment exports in 2022. In addition to

garments, export earnings from the USA were

mainly on account of rubber products, machinery

and mechanical appliances, and chemical

products. Garments, rubber products, machinery

and mechanical appliances, and food, beverages

and tobacco were major products exported to the

UK. Exports to India were dominated by animal

fodder, spices, textiles, and minor agricultural

products. The EU, the most dominant region for Sri

Lankan exports, accounted for about 23 per cent of

total exports in 2022, including about 30 per cent of

total garment exports. Other major items exported

to the EU were rubber products, food, beverages

and tobacco, and tea, most of which were exported

under the EU Generalised System of Preferences

Plus (GSP+) Scheme. In 2022, the Middle East and

the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS),

led by Russia were the main export destinations for

tea, jointly contributing to about 59 per cent of tea

exports.

Asian countries continued to be the major

source of Sri Lankan imports, despite overall

imports from most of those countries declining

in 2022, compared to 2021. India regained its

position as the largest source of imports since 2018,

recording more than US dollars 4.7 billion in imports

in 2022, with a share of about 25.9 per cent of total

imports, partly supported by imports made under

the credit lines offered by India. Accordingly, import

expenditure from India has marginally increased

by 2.4 per cent, mainly with imports of petroleum

products and rice. Meanwhile, China, the second

largest, and Malaysia, the third largest, import

sourcing countries in 2022, accounting for shares of

about 18.0 per cent and 5.3 per cent, respectively.

Expenditure on most major import items from

China, such as machinery and equipment, medical

and pharmaceuticals (COVID-19 vaccines),

telecommunication devices (mainly mobile phones),

and building materials declined in 2022. The major

imports from Malaysia were petroleum products,

chemical products, and food preparations, while

petroleum products contributed to around 65

percent of the total imports from Malaysia. As import

sources, Singapore and the UAE were at the fourth

and fifth positions in 2022. The major import item

from both Singapore and the UAE was petroleum

products in 2022. In line with the decline in total

import expenditure during 2022, expenditure related

to most import sources, including the top ten import

sources of Sri Lanka (except India, Malaysia, Russia

and Singapore) recorded a decline.

External Trade Policies, Developments and Institutional Support

Despite the country registering the

worst economic downturn ever in 2022, the

merchandise trade sector remained buoyant

supported by the efforts of all the stakeholders.

The continuation of the implementation of the

National Export Strategy (NES) 2018-2022 and

the provisioning of institutional support helped

the export sector to remain resilient, while the

depreciation of the exchange rate largely benefitted

the export sector. Certain policy measures, such

as repatriation and conversion requirements of

export proceeds, import restrictions, and imposition

of margin requirements, among others, were

warranted, despite being an inconvenience to the

tradeable sector. This was in order to safeguard

the interests of all stakeholders of the economy

amidst the worst BOP crisis witnessed in the

post-independence economy. Measures were

taken to resume negotiations of free trade

agreements in an expeditious manner, while

initiating measures to improve on terms of existing

trade agreements. The Government announced

several trade supportive policies in the Budget 2023,

such as establishing an International Trade Office

to deal with all trade negotiations and an Agency

for External Trade and Investment to coordinate

with institutions engaged in external trade and

reintroducing a Trade Adjustment Programme.

There is a strong necessity for consistent and

comprehensive policies to support exports and

substitution of selected imports and their timely

implementation as the economy recovers in the

period ahead. The global economy rebounded from

the negative spillovers of COVID-19 during the first

half of 2022, although the Russia-Ukraine war, high

inflation, tight monetary policy, and recessionary

fears in global markets kept the second half of

2022 more challenging, with downside risks to the

macroeconomic outlook. As a result, the World

Trade Organization (WTO) estimated that the

growth of world merchandise trade volume would

have been limited to 3.5 per cent in 2022 (a decline

from 9.7 per cent recorded in 2021) and that it

would moderate to 1.0 per cent in 2023. Against

this backdrop, aggressive policies to tackle issues

in the near term are important, while providing

more sustained policy interventions by authorities,

in a consistent manner, to overcome future

domestic and global challenges over the medium

to long term. Priority should be given to alleviate

supply side constraints, such as high production

costs, while strengthening the export orientation,

supported by Research and Development (R&D)

led innovation to harness potential global value

chains and product networks, improving value

addition, rationalising the institutional framework,

removing bureaucratic bottlenecks and creating a

trade and investor friendly environment.

Significant trade policy measures were

initiated to manage import expenditure in 2022.

Considering the high import expenditure during

the first quarter of 2022 and the unprecedented

pressure on the exchange rate, the Government

and the Central Bank initiated several measures to

curtail the demand for imports during the first half

of 2022. Accordingly, the Government imposed

measures, such as licensing requirements, and

an increase in import taxes from March 2022,

while the Central Bank allowed more flexibility in

the exchange rate in March 2022 and imposed a

100 per cent cash margin requirement on selected

imports from May 2022. In view of curtailing import

payments made through informal channels and

the resultant pressures on the exchange rate

emanating from parallel markets, the Imports and

Exports Control Department introduced restrictions

on the use of trade payment terms, including open

accounts, consignment accounts, Documents

against Acceptance (DA), and Documents against

Payment (DP). Accordingly, with effect from 20

May 2022, importing on open account/consignment

account payment terms was allowed for direct and

indirect exporters only, while the use of DA and

DP terms for imports, excluding those used for

exports, were required to be made only under prior

arrangements with the licensed banks. This helped

manage the availability of foreign exchange within

the banking system for the most essential imports.

However, considering the possible shortages of

essential food and raw materials in the domestic

market due to such limitations, several relaxations

were introduced for imports of selected essential

food items and raw materials required for

domestic production since June 2022. In view of

the further build-up of pressure on the availability

of foreign exchange and the exchange rate, the

Government imposed further import restrictions by

way of temporary suspensions, mainly targeting

selected consumer and investment goods, in

August 2022, although several relaxations were

Introduction

The external sector of Sri Lanka experienced heightened vulnerabilities with the decline in foreign exchange inflows due to unprecedented challenges in recent years, amidst the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and adverse developments in the global economy. The current account deficit widened due to the increased imports led by the normalisation of economic activities, moderation in tourism earnings and slowdown in workers’ remittances. Downgrading of the sovereign credit ratings of the country constrained the access to global capital markets despite high debt servicing requirements, further aggravating the situation. In view of mounting imbalances in the external sector due to the lack of foreign exchange inflows, several measures were taken to improve foreign currency liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market and to replenish international reserves. These included establishing rules (Table B 7.1) mandating repatriation of export proceeds to the country within 180 days and conversion of such receipts into Sri Lanka rupees under the provisions of the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949 (MLA) in 2021, with a view to effectively enforcing such requirements.

Evolution of Policies Related to Export Proceeds Repatriation and Conversion

For any economy, exports form a very important source of foreign exchange inflows that help build buffers against external shocks. Having identified the importance of the exports, successive Governments in Sri Lanka have put in place policies that are conducive for building a vibrant exports sector. However, to obtain the maximum benefits of the export sector, a country needs to ensure that export proceeds are repatriated so that there would be no strain on the Balance of Payments. The requirement to repatriate export proceeds into Sri Lanka was initially imposed during 1973 under the repealed Exchange Control Act No. 24 of 1953 (ECA) and continued until 1993. This requirement for repatriation and surrender was liberalised subsequent to accepting Article VIII of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Articles of Agreement in 1994, as part of further liberalisation of current account transactions and continuation of the country’s stabilisation programme. Accordingly, exporters were permitted to repatriate export proceeds and hold those in rupee or foreign currency accounts in Sri Lanka or retain them in foreign currency accounts in a bank abroad. However, the repatriation

BOX 7Monitoring of Export Proceeds Repatriations and Conversions

requirement was re-introduced in April 2016 under the ECA, requiring every exporter of goods to repatriate proceeds to Sri Lanka initially within 90 days from the date of exportation. This was subsequently extended up to 120 days. With the enactment of the Foreign Exchange Act, No. 12 of 2017 (FEA) these regulations were re-issued and in October 2019 further extended to 180 days. It is pertinent to mention that some of the regional economies which could be considered economic peers of Sri Lanka also have similar policies in place to ensure that such economies optimise the receipt of export proceeds (Table B 7.2).

How Export Proceeds Help to Build Reserves

Once export proceeds are repatriated, part of the proceeds will be utilised to meet obligations in foreign currency, such as authorized payments. If the balance is sold to Authorised Dealers1 (ADs) in foreign exchange, such proceeds will be added to the domestic foreign exchange market increasing the liquidity. Similarly, inflows from other foreign exchange sources which are sold to ADs, such as workers’ remittances, tourism earnings and foreign investments flows will also contribute to increase the domestic market liquidity. The banking system needs to accommodate various foreign exchange requirements of its customers, both of current and capital nature, for which the foreign currency so purchased will be utilised. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) may build up its reserves by purchasing foreign exchange from the domestic foreign exchange market. The major advantage of export proceeds is that they are non-debt creating inflows which exert no strain on the Balance of Payments.

Existing Rules on Repatriation of Export Proceeds into Sri Lanka issued under the MLA (Rules)

Considering the anticipated serious decline in the international reserves which could lead to an imminent threat to the stability of the Sri Lanka rupee, the CBSL took immediate measures to preserve the position by adopting necessary policies including introduction of Rules on export proceeds repatriation and conversion requirements under the provisions of the MLA (Table B 7.1).

In terms of the prevailing Rules (Table B 7.1), it is mandatory to receive the export proceeds into Sri Lanka,

in respect of all goods exported or services provided outside Sri Lanka, within 180 days from the date of shipment or provisioning of services. Further, every exporter of goods who receives export proceeds in Sri Lanka, is required to mandatorily convert2 the residual of the export proceeds received in Sri Lanka, into Sri Lanka rupees upon utilising such proceeds only in respect of the authorised payments, which could provide an immediate impact on the liquidity of the domestic exchange market whilst allowing for foreign currency requirements of the business. These authorized payments are, outward remittances for current transactions related to the particular export, withdrawal in foreign currency notes or transfer of funds for travel purposes, debt servicing expenses and repayments of permitted borrowings, payments for investments in Sri Lanka Development Bonds, authorised payments to local suppliers, payment of dividends to non-resident investors, salaries to expatriate employees and one month commitments related to export of goods and services.

Considering the developments in the domestic foreign exchange market, conversion requirements imposed by these Rules are reviewed and revised continuously.

2 Upon utilisation of export proceeds for permitted authorised payments, exporters convert export proceeds for their local currency requirements of day-to-day business activities and any residues of the export proceeds shall be mandatorily converted on or before the seventh (7th) day of the following month.

As per the requirements of the Rules, ADs are required to strictly monitor the monthly receipts of export proceeds, ensure that the conversion is within the stipulated period of repatriation and verify that the authorised payments are related to the particular export of goods/services. At present, periodic information related to repatriation of export proceeds and the conversions are reported manually to the CBSL and Department of Foreign Exchange (DFE) inspects and examines the records provided by ADs to ensure full and strict compliance with the provisions of the Rules. The Rules empower the Director of the DFE to monitor and initiate actions against any non-compliance by exporters and ADs.

Accordingly, all ADs must submit the following monthly information on export proceeds repatriation and its conversion to DFE on or before the 15th of the next month.

the date of shipment or provisioning of services, in line with the requirement of the Rules on export proceeds repatriation.

• Export proceeds repatriations received exceeding 180

Monitoring of compliance with the Rules

Based on the information reported by ADs on monthly basis, the CBSL requests exporters who do not repatriate export proceeds within 180 days from the date of shipment or provisioning of services to provide explanations for same. Based on the responses, the possibility of initiating legal actions for exporters who do not comply with the Rules on requirement of repatriation of export proceeds into Sri Lanka, is considered by the CBSL. Further, the utilisation of export proceeds for authorised payments are strictly monitored and inquiries are made from ADs in order to ensure ADs permit payments which are authorised by the Rules.

In addition to the monthly monitoring of the repatriation and conversion of export proceeds, the CBSL carries out investigations on selected exporters on their repatriation

and conversion of export proceeds by requesting information directly from such exporters. This has enabled the CBSL to verify the information reported by ADs and has facilitated streamlining of data reporting. Special investigations on foreign currency loans granted by ADs, payments to local suppliers, conversions by local suppliers etc. are also carried out by the CBSL to ensure that the utilisation and conversion of export proceeds are in line with the Rules.

Further, the CBSL conducts one-on-one meetings with exporters, sector wise meetings, meetings with compliance officers and discussions with other stakeholders of the export sector to enhance awareness on the prevailing Rules and ensure strict compliance with the same.

Timely imposition of Rules together with the subsequent stringent monitoring has resulted in a notable improvement in the repatriation of export proceeds since October 2021 (Figure B 7.1). Merchandise goods and service exports repatriation during the year 2022 amounted to US dollars 17,755.8 million, where the repatriation of goods amounted to US dollars 14,595.7 million and repatriation of services exports amounted to US dollars 3,160.1 million. The export value of merchandise goods and services for the year 2022 was US dollars 16,168.8 million.

of export proceeds repatriated have ranged between 20.6%-28.5% during the year 2022 (Figure B 7.2 and Figure B 7.3). Attentive surveillance on the utilisation of export proceeds for authorised payments enabled a gradual pickup in conversion of repatriations during the latter part of the year. The total converted value of merchandise goods and service exports amounted to US dollars 4,220.2 million for the year 2022, comprising conversion of merchandise goods amounting to US dollars 3,614.6 million and conversion of service exports amounting to US dollars 605.6 million.

Export Proceeds Monitoring System (EPMS)

In view of the need to efficiently monitor the repatriation of export proceeds, the Export Proceeds Monitoring System (EPMS), an IT based automated monitoring system, was launched in June 2022. This system facilitates monitoring of repatriation of export proceeds within the prescribed time period and conversion of export proceeds into the local currency in order to achieve the objective of introducing the Rules. The system is expected to enhance

the efficiency of reporting and monitoring by minimising manual data processing and duplication of data entry at various stages.

The CBSL, Sri Lanka Customs (SLC) and ADs are the three main participants in the system. SLC shares details

made in September 2022, thereby reducing the

effectiveness of such restrictions. However, these

measures were paramount in managing stresses in

the external sector during 2022.

Several measures were taken to improve

institutional support to the external sector

during 2022. The Export Development Board

(EDB) continued with the implementation of the NES

2018-2022, while addressing bottlenecks that

hamper faster implementation, such as lack

of coordination among stakeholders and lack

of authority rested with the EDB to implement

NES action plan activities. Accordingly, the

implementation process of the NES is expected to

be revisited to introduce necessary adjustments that

would align with current developments, to achieve

its desired goals by 2027. The EDB continued

web-based and physical promotional activities and

provided trade information and market intelligence

for exporters. Trade chambers also contributed

towards export promotion by recognising exporters

and conducting Export Awards ceremonies, while

helping to link-up the public and private sector

stakeholders in policymaking and grievance

of all exports which are shipped out of the country in the EPMS whilst ADs report details of repatriations and conversions linked to such exports to the EPMS (Figure B 7.4). Accordingly, more accurate details of exports will be available in the future. The system will facilitate detecting where proceeds have not been repatriated within the stipulated time period and taking actions against non-compliant exporters.

The EPMS has continued to evolve since its introduction in June 2022 and certain technical lapses, such as those in the process of uploading by ADs of export remittance data based on CUSDECs3, have been successfully resolved. At present, IT solutions which link the exporters with ADs are being developed to simplify the provision of information. Accordingly, barriers in receiving and matching information on the export receipts against the

3 Custom Declaration

CUSDECs, especially on open account transactions, will be minimised. Hence, this system will improve the efficiency of the export proceeds repatriation monitoring mechanism and streamline the repatriation of export proceeds into the country, through a national system linking related information of the CBSL, SLC and ADs in the future.

The success of monitoring and follow up of export transactions via this system can only be achieved by effective collaboration of all the stakeholders of the system. Hence, it is the responsibility of all participants of this system to work towards the success of this national effort.

The performance of bilateral and regional

trade agreements remained unsatisfactory in

2022, while several initiatives were taken to

resume trade negotiations that remained at a

standstill since 2018. Under bilateral Free Trade

Agreements (FTAs), Sri Lanka benefitted from the

Indo-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISFTA)

and the Pakistan-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement

(PSFTA). Exports through FTAs with India and

Pakistan remained high in 2022, as a share of total

exports to these countries, at 65 per cent and 73 per

cent, respectively. Meanwhile, imports under ISFTA

and PSFTA continued to be low during the year, with

shares of only 3 per cent (US dollars 119 million)

and 4 per cent (US dollars 13 million) of total imports

from India and Pakistan, respectively. Meanwhile,

the Department of Commerce (DOC) updated the

Non-Tariff Measures dossier in 2022, incorporating

suggestions proposed by stakeholders with regard

to ISFTA implementation related issues, including

either the removal of the current quota restriction

of 8 million pieces on apparel or to further increase

the quota. Trade under regional trade agreements

declined during 2022 with a moderation of trade

under the Asia Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA),

due to lower exports to China, and the Global

System of Trade Preferences (GSTP), due to lower

cinnamon exports to Mexico. Exports under the

SAARC Preferential Trade Arrangement (SAPTA)

continued to remain at marginal levels, while exports

under the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA)

declined during 2022. These factors highlight on the

importance of strengthening trade ties with regional

peers to effectively execute existing regional

agreements, while essentially exploring possible

entry to new and broader regional partnerships,

such as Regional Comprehensive Economic

Partnership (RCEP). Renewed measures

were taken during 2022 to expedite the review

process of the Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade

Agreement (SLSFTA), which failed to take off

June 2022. The report includes recommendations

Sri Lanka’s exports under Generalised

System of Preference (GSP) schemes remained

unchanged in 2022, although overall earnings

from exports improved over 2021. Sri Lanka

continued to benefit from GSP schemes in

2022, while the facility offered by the EU, the

USA and the UK contributed to approximately

72 per cent of total preferential exports of Sri

Lanka. Sri Lanka is expected to benefit from the

current EU GSP+ scheme until its validity period

by end of 2023. Meanwhile, the new EU GSP+

10-year cycle is expected to be in effect from 01

January 2024 to 31 December 2033 with six new

International Conventions, in addition to the existing

27 conventions, in the current cycle. Sri Lanka is

in a position to reapply for GSP+ as it has already

ratified the six new conventions. Sri Lanka as an

EU GSP+ beneficiary, continued to enjoy the same

duty-free access to the UK under the UK’s Global

Tariffs (UKGT) during 2021 and UK GSP scheme

in 2022. However, the UK introduced its new GSP

Scheme “Developing Countries Trading Scheme

(DCTS)” in August 2022, which will come into effect

in 2023. Sri Lanka is expected to benefit from the

DCTS Enhanced Preferences Scheme for 3 years

from its launch. In addition, Sri Lanka continued

to benefit from GSP schemes offered by several

other countries, such as the Russian Federation,

Australia, Canada, Turkey, Switzerland, Norway,

and New Zealand, although their contribution to

exports remained relatively low. The narrow export

base of Sri Lanka and the low product coverage of

GSP schemes prevent Sri Lanka from harnessing

the full benefit of such GSP schemes.

5.2.2 Services Account

The trade in services account recorded

a higher surplus in 2022, compared to the

previous year, mainly due to the increase in

earnings from tourism. However, inflows to

almost all other sub sectors in the services account,

including freight transportation services and IT/

BPO services, recorded significant contractions.

As a result of these developments, the surplus in

the services account amounted to US dollars 2,110

million in 2022, compared to US dollars 1,586

million in 2021.

Travel and Tourism

Tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka recorded a steady

recovery in 2022 despite significant headwinds

due to unprecedented disruptions amidst

heightened social tensions, fuel shortages and

power outages, and travel advisories, among

others. This recovery was supported mainly by high

global vaccination rates, increased air connectivity,

along with the lifting of travel restrictions issued by

major source countries. The notable exchange rate

depreciation and tourism promotion campaigns

also helped position Sri Lanka as an attractive

destination for travel. Tourist arrivals, which started

to gather momentum from late 2021, peaked in

March 2022, before being hampered by heightened

social tensions, shortage of fuel for domestic

travel, and resultant negative publicity and travel

advisories issued by major source markets. In

addition to domestic factors, the Russia-Ukraine

war that caused spillovers to European countries,

and the outward travel ban in China also negatively

impacted the recovery in tourist arrivals. However,

some countries reduced the severity of their travel

advisories with the dissipation of social tensions,

resulting in a gradual pickup of arrivals since

October 2022, and increased momentum towards

early 2023. The resumption of operations of many

international airlines, charter flights and cruise

tourism as well as the global promotions in many

countries also contributed to the revival of tourist

arrivals. Accordingly, tourist arrivals recorded a

significant increase during 2022 to 719,978 from

194,495 in 2021. However, Sri Lanka has witnessed

over 2 million tourist arrivals per year on average

prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This implies that Sri Lanka’s tourism industry must

recover faster to reach its maximum potential.

Europe continued to be the largest source

region of tourists arrivals to Sri Lanka, while

India remained the largest single country of

tourist arrivals. According to the Sri Lanka Tourism

Development Authority (SLTDA), tourist arrivals

from across all major regions increased in 2022,

compared to 2021, with Europe accounting for 60 per

cent of total tourist arrivals, amounting to 432,226

tourists. Asia and the Pacific region recorded the

second highest arrivals with 213,537 tourists in

2022, accounting for about 30 per cent of total tourist

arrivals. In terms of tourist arrivals by countries,

India was the leading tourist source market in 2022,

with 123,004 arrivals, accounting for about 17 per

cent of total arrivals, followed by Russia (91,272),

the UK (85,187), Germany (55,542), and France

(35,482), collectively accounting for 54 per cent

of total arrivals.

Earnings from tourism in 2022 recorded a

significant increase, compared to 2021. Earnings

from tourism amounted to US dollars 1,136 million,

compared to US dollars 507 million in 2021,

recording an impressive annual growth of 124.2

per cent. However, earnings from tourism were far

below the US dollars 4.4 billion level achieved in

2018. Based on revised estimates of the SLTDA

on tourist spending and duration of stay, the

average spending per tourist in 2022 amounted to

US dollars 169.0 per day, compared to US dollars

172.6 per day in 2021. Meanwhile, the average

duration of stay by a tourist was estimated at 9.3 days

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

175

in 2022, in comparison to 15.1 days in 2021. The

higher duration of stay in 2021 was mainly due to the

quarantine requirements amidst COVID-19 related

restrictions. Meanwhile, outward travel by Sri Lankan

residents remained at moderate levels in 2022,

compared to 2021, reflecting the impact of significant

shortage of foreign exchange in the country.

Investment in the tourism sector

was hampered in 2022, with delays and

down-scaling of projects by investors, as well

as disturbances in the construction industry

amidst the challenging economic conditions.

SLTDA received 42 new investment projects relating

to the tourism sector for approval, amounting to

US dollars 68 million in 2022, with a capacity of 1,054

rooms. There was a decline of 48.8 per cent in the

investment value of the projects received in 2022,

compared to 2021. In terms of approved projects,

the SLTDA granted approvals for 20 tourism-related

projects in 2022, amounting to US dollars

36 million, with a collective capacity of 363 rooms.

In addition, 95 hotel projects with 5,424 rooms are

currently under construction at different levels of

completion, while 25 hotel projects with a capacity

of 1,623 rooms are expected to be completed

by 2023. Accordingly, graded establishments,

amounting to 469, with a total capacity of 25,597

rooms, and supplementary establishments,

including boutique villas, bungalows, guest houses,

heritage bungalows, heritage homes, home

stay units, rented apartments and rented homes

amounting to 3,360, with a total capacity of 22,523

rooms, were in operation in 2022.

Several policy initiatives and various

promotional programmes were carried out

to attract more tourists in 2022. Sri Lanka’s

tourism will need to explore fresh niche markets

and undertake a strong marketing campaign to

take advantage of the thriving global tourism

industry. Towards achieving this, SLTDA published

a Strategic Plan for Sri Lanka Tourism 2022-2025

in April 2022, identifying issues, opportunities and

actions proposed, in order to set an agenda for

the recovery and future resilience of the tourism

sector. In support of easing the arrival procedure,

Sri Lanka resumed the visa-on-arrival facility

for international travellers in January 2022 for

most countries. Several measures were taken

by SLTDA to address hardship faced by various

tourism service providers amidst the pandemic

and the economic crisis, such as extending the

validity period of all types of tourist guide licenses,

waiving off the annual registration fee of all tourist

establishments and individuals listed under the

SLTDA, etc. Preventive measures, which were

in place during the COVID-19 pandemic period,

were removed in December 2022, including the

requirement to produce a negative PCR test report

on arrival. Meanwhile, the total number of SLTDA

registered accommodations increased in 2022.

The Central Bank requested the banks to provide

concessions to affected borrowers in all economic

sectors, including tourism, on a case-by-case basis,

for a six month period till December 2022, taking

into account the extraordinary macroeconomic

circumstances that prevailed during 2022. The

Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTPB)

organised familiarisation campaigns for travel

agents from Russia and Ukraine in order to attract

more tourists from the CIS region, while such

initiatives were expanded to the Middle Eastern

region as well. Further, various promotional

campaigns, such as film tourism and the hosting of

road-shows were held, targeting the Indian market.

Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Wellness Tourism

Stakeholder Project was officially launched in

February 2022. Also, some of the hotels and

resorts in Sri Lanka have received accolades in

various forums within the global tourism industry.

Accordingly, Sri Lanka was accredited as ‘One

of the world’s safest countries to travel’ by

Worldpackers and ‘Best destinations to travel in

2023’ by Independent Magazine–UK. Moreover,

Sri Lanka was recognised among the ‘Top 20

places to travel’ by Readers’ Choice awards by

Conde Nast Traveller during 2022. The tourism

sector faced a multitude of challenges; an increase

in electricity tariffs; taxes and levies pertaining to

businesses engaging in the tourism sector; lack of

skilled staff in hotels due to high labour migration;

reduction in arrivals from the CIS region due to

the Russia-Ukraine war; high inflation, globally

and domestically; looming global recessionary

conditions, and the current economic crisis in Sri

Lanka. Overcoming these challenges would require

combined efforts by all stakeholders of the industry.

Transport, Telecommunications, Computer and Information Services and Other Services

Most of the subsectors in the services account

of the BOP, including transport, computer and

information services, etc., recorded notable

under performance in 2022. Both sea and air

freight transport subsectors recorded negative

growth. All indicators under sea freight, including

cargo handling, transshipments, ship arrivals and

container handling recorded negative growth during

the year, particularly declining in the second half

of 2022. The key reason for this decline was the

gradual decline in merchandise imports after the

first quarter of 2022. The depreciation of the Sri

Lanka rupee, severe foreign currency liquidity

shortage in the domestic foreign exchange market

that led to the announcement of a debt standstill,

import restrictions imposed by the Government as

well as the moderation of global trade during the

second half of 2022 exacerbated the aforementioned

decline. This, combined with gradually decreasing

international freight rates from record high prices

in 2020 and 2021, due to COVID-19 disruptions,

resulted in earnings from both sea and air freight

transport services, declining during 2022, compared

to the previous year. However, both inflows and

outflows in the air passenger transport services

recorded positive growth during the year, with

increased tourist arrivals and the gradual resumption

of Sri Lankan residents travelling abroad. Further,

travel outflow remained at modest levels in 2022,

similar to that of the previous year. The Information

Technology led Business Process Outsourcing (IT/

BPO) sector faced significant challenges during

2022. The economic instability that prevailed

within the country prompted many professionals in

the sector to explore better opportunities beyond

the country, resulting in a significant dearth of

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

177

5

experienced professionals in the industry. Further,

the mandatory conversion of proceeds of exports

of services, which was in force for a short period

during 2022, was also perceived by the industry as

unfavourable. This situation was aggravated with

a general slowdown in global outsourcing sources

and layoffs in technical level employees. As a

result of these adverse developments, the export

of computer services recorded a negative growth in

2022, compared to 2021. Inflows to other services

exports subsectors, including financial services,

construction services, government services and

other business services, also recorded negative

growths during the year, coinciding with the decline

in economic activities and economic instability that

prevailed during the year.

5.2.3 Primary Income

The primary income account deficit recorded

a marginal moderation in 2022, compared

to 2021. The primary income account outflows

reflected all interest payments, including those

interest payments in arrears due to the temporary

suspension of related government external debt

servicing since mid-April 2022.1 Accordingly, the

primary income account deficit amounted to US

dollars 1,874 million in 2022, compared to US

dollars 1,959 million in 2021. There was a notable

increase in outflows of dividends from foreign direct

investment enterprises during the year, compared

to the previous year. This was mainly due to some

large FDI companies, listed in the CSE, declaring

sizable dividends. However, reinvested earnings of

FDI companies were lower in 2022 compared to

the previous year. Meanwhile, coupon payments

of portfolio investments, including arrears,

declined marginally, with the outstanding liability

of International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) reducing,

1 Based on the accrual principle of accounting, as per the 6th edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6)

consequent to the repayment of an ISB in July

2021 and January 2022. However, there was a

notable increase in interest payments on foreign

loans, including arrears, with all sectors including

the Government, banking sector and private

corporations paying higher interest expenses. This

high level of interest expenses may be possibly

due to higher interest payments on variable interest

rate loans with the increase in global interest

rates as well as the increased risk premia faced

by Sri Lankan banks and corporations due to the

suspension of selected external debt servicing

and the downgrade of the country’s credit ratings.

Meanwhile, the income from reserve assets

declined with the notable decline in the gross

official reserves during 2022.

5.2.4 Secondary Income

The surplus in the secondary income

account declined in 2022, compared to the

previous year, despite a significant revival

in workers’ remittances in the second half

of 2022. Workers’ remittances amounted to US

dollars 3,789 million in 2022, compared to US

dollars 5,491 million in 2021. This was a decline

of 31 per cent in 2022, compared to 2021, limiting

the surplus in the secondary income account

to US dollars 3,496 million in 2022, compared

to US dollars 5,228 million in 2021. Workers’

remittances to the banking system remained

subdued, particularly in the first half of the

year, amidst the large differences in exchange

rates offered by the banking system and money

changers. The adjustment in the exchange rate in

early March 2022, which resulted in a significant

overshooting and subsequent gradual alignment

of the exchange rates offered by banks with

those outside the banking system helped revive

workers’ remittances channelled through the

banking system. There was also a possibility of

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

178

5

workers’ remittances being used for financing

imports in informal markets, as forex liquidity in

the banking system dried up significantly. With the

economy gradually stabilising towards the latter

part of the year, and with greater stability in the

exchange rate supported by policy measures of

the Central Bank, the higher margins offered in

parallel markets reduced to a bare minimum, and

gradual use of banking channels for repatriation

of workers’ remittances resumed. Consequently,

workers’ remittances in the fourth quarter of 2022

were notably high, averaging around US dollars

400 million per month, compared to a monthly

average of around US dollars 286 million during

January-September 2022. The number of migrant

workers departed for foreign employment who

registered with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign

Employment (SLBFE) amounted to 311,056, which

was a significant increase, compared to 122,264

in 2021 and 53,711 in 2020. Several policy

measures were undertaken by the CBSL and the

Government, encouraging migrant workers to use

official channels to repatriate their remittances,

including incentive schemes, while the banking

sector also promoted the use of official channels

for remitting money. The CBSL, in collaboration

with the banking sector, Lanka Clear and other

stakeholders, introduced a digital app ‘SLRemit’

to promote the digitalisation of repatriation of

workers’ remittances.

5.3 Capital Account Balance

Net inflows to the capital account remained

subdued in 2022. Capital transfers to both the

Government and private sector decreased in

2022, compared to the previous year with capital

grants to the Government remaining modest.

Accordingly, the capital account recorded a

surplus of US dollars 19 million in 2022, compared

to a surplus of US dollars 25 million recorded in

2021.

5.4 Financial Account

In the financial account of the BOP, net

incurrence of liabilities increased notably,

while net acquisition of financial assets

recorded a modest increase during 2022.

Transactions in the financial account in 2022

were mainly characterised by the temporary

suspension of selected external debt service

payments of the Government from mid-April 2022,

reflecting the unprecedented depletion of usable

GOR levels. With the suspension of these debt

service payments, the country’s sovereign ratings

applicable for external borrowing were categorised

as default, causing significant difficulties in

attracting financial flows to the country. Prior to

the debt suspension, a maturing ISB of US dollars

500 million was repaid in January 2022, while an

international swap facility of US dollars 400 million

from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was received.

With the suspension of selected external debt

servicing, securing financing became extremely

difficult even for meeting the funds required for

essential imports. The regional countries provided

prompt assistance during this period, with several

credit lines to import fuel, medicine, fertiliser, etc.,

while extending the repayment dates of bilateral

credit lines and international swap liabilities.

Consequently, the Government received around

US dollars 2,391 million in foreign loans during

2022, which was the major inflow to the financial

account. This comprised of emergency credit

facilities as well as emergency assistance of

multilateral agencies by diverting and repurposing

the contracted funds for development projects

towards emergency funding assistance.

Net incurrence of liabilities recorded an

increase during 2022. Net incurrence of liabilities

recorded a net increase of US dollars 2,030 million

in 2022, compared to a net increase of US dollars

2,098 million in 2021. FDI flows, including foreign

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

179

5

loans to direct investment enterprises (DIEs),

recorded an improvement in 2022, compared to

the previous year, albeit remaining well below the

country’s potential and FDI flows to regional peers.

The main contribution to FDI came in the form of

increased equity investments, which was partly

attributable to some major companies listed in the

CSE opting to invest their profits due to the inability

to repatriate dividends abroad because of the

dearth of foreign exchange in 2022. Further, there

was a notable increase in shareholder advances

and intercompany loans to companies registered

with the Board of Investment (BOI) of Sri Lanka.

Meanwhile, foreign loans inflows from unrelated

parties to BOI companies also recorded an increase

in 2022. As a result, FDI, including foreign loans,

amounted to US dollars 1,181 million in 2022,

compared to US dollars 779 million in 2021. Out

of the total FDI, including loans, US dollars 1,076

million were for companies registered with the BOI.

Further, FDI, excluding loans, amounted to US

dollars 898 million in 2022, compared to US dollars

592 million in 2021. On a sector-wise basis, FDI

inflows to BOI registered companies were mainly to

telecommunications, manufacturing and property

development, while FDI flows to CSE companies,

not registered with the BOI, were mainly to logistics

and fuel, gas and petroleum sectors. Further,

FDI flows to the West Container Terminals in the

Colombo Port also started to materialise in the

latter part of 2022. FDI flows to the Colombo Port

City and the Hambantota Port project are expected

to materialise in the near term.

Portfolio investment, including equity

investments by minority shareholders

to the CSE and foreign investments in

government securities, increased during

the year, compared to a reduction in the

previous year. Non-resident holdings of rupee

denominated government securities remained

significantly low due to high divestiture of these

instruments by foreign investors in the past few

years. In terms of ISB repayments, the Government

repaid US dollars 500 million in early 2022. The ISB

repayment of US dollars 1,000 million, which was

due in July 2022, was subjected to the temporary

suspension. As per the accrual concept of reporting

BOP statistics, arrears due to non-payment of

coupon payments and interest on foreign loans

have to be added to the outstanding liability of the

respective debt instrument. Accordingly, US dollars

551 million of ISB coupon payments were recorded

as accrued ISB interest payments to non residents,

while US dollars 149 million was recorded as

accrued interest payment on foreign loans. Further,

US dollars 6 million was recorded as accrued interest

on international bonds to non residents, which

were issued by state owned business enterprises

(SOBEs). Meanwhile, trade credits and advances

recorded a significant decline in liabilities as the

Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) continued

to repay its trade credit liabilities throughout the

year, while being unable to secure new trade credit

facilities during the year. Foreign loan exposure in

the banking sector declined during the year due

to fewer new foreign borrowings, while continuing

to pay off existing borrowings, particularly with

increased foreign exchange liquidity in the banking

system in the latter part of 2022. Meanwhile, the

Central Bank continued to repay the IMF-EFF

arrangement obtained during 2015-2019, while

the Government continued to repay foreign loans

obtained from other multilateral organisations

that were not subjected to the debt standstill.

Corporate sector borrowings also remained

significantly limited, and net inflows remained

negligible to the sector during the year.

Net acquisition of financial assets recorded

a marginal increase during 2022. Net acquisition

of financial assets recorded a marginal increase of

US dollars 84 million in 2022, compared to a net

decline of US dollars 2,113 million in 2021. GOR

declined by US dollars 1,234 million during the

year, mainly due to the debt service payments prior

to the debt suspension from mid-April 2022, and

the need to supply foreign exchange to the banking

system to facilitate imports of essential goods

amidst significant BOP pressures. However, net

acquisition of assets in terms of currency and

deposits, and other accounts receivable, increased

in the banking sector, particularly in the latter part

of 2022. Trade credit and advances extended by

Sri Lankan exporters to non-residents increased

during the year with the increase in merchandise

exports in 2022, compared to the previous year.

5.5 Overall Balance

The overall balance of the BOP, which

represents the change in net international

reserves, continued to record a significant

deficit in 2022. GOR declined notably in 2022,

due to the continued moderation of inflows to the

financial account, external debt service payments

made prior to the temporary suspension of external

debt service payments of the Government and net

sales to the domestic foreign exchange market

by the Central Bank, primarily for importation of

essential imports during the year. While the reserve

assets declined during the year, the reserve related

liabilities recorded a significant increase with the

receipt of an international swap facility from the RBI

of US dollars 400 million, as well as the accumulation

of Asian Clearing Union (ACU) liabilities by US

dollars 1,492 million during the year. Consequently,

net international reserves recorded a substantial

deficit by end 2022, resulting in a deficit of the

overall balance of US dollars 2,806 million in 2022,

compared to a deficit of US dollars 3,967 million in

2021.

5.6 International Investment Position (IIP)

Sri Lanka’s external liability position

declined, while the external asset position

remained at similar levels at end 2022, compared

to end 2021. The country’s external liability position

amounted to US dollars 58,862 million at end 2022,

compared to US dollars 63,967 million at end 2021.

This was mainly due to the decline in market value

of ISBs held by the Government. Meanwhile, the

country’s external asset position amounted to US

dollars 8,830 million at end 2022, compared to a

similar level at end 2021. Reserve asset position

recorded a significant decline, while the banking

sector foreign assets increased, resulting in the

total asset position remaining at around the same

levels at the end of the year. Consequently, the net

liability position of the IIP declined to US dollars

50,032 million at end 2022, compared to US dollars

55,210 million at end 2021.

Sri Lanka’s external asset position with

non-residents remained at similar levels during

2022. There was a notable decline in the GOR

from US dollars 3,139 million as at end 2021 to US

dollars 1,898 million, as at end 2022.2 However,

there was a significant increase in the asset position

of deposit taking corporations, with currency and

deposits positions, and other accounts’ receivable

position recording a notable increase during the

year, mainly due to the gradual increase of foreign

currency liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange

market towards the end of 2022. Meanwhile, the

outstanding asset position of trade credit and

advances as at end 2022, increased from the

position observed at end 2021, primarily due to

the increase in trade credit advances given by Sri

Lankan exporters to their customers during the year.

Further, the foreign direct investment asset position

recorded a marginal increase during the year.

Sri Lanka’s total liability position to

non-residents, declined by around US dollars

5.1 billion during the year. The main reason

for this decline was the substantial reduction

in the outstanding position of ISBs, which is

reflected in IIP statistics in terms of market value,

from US dollars 6,233 million as at end 2021 to

US dollars 3,315 million as at end 2022. However,

the outstanding ISB position, in terms of face

value held by non-residents, amounted to US

dollars 10,800 million as at end 2022, compared to

US dollars 11,191 million as at end 2021. There

was a substantial decline in the market value of Sri

Lanka’s outstanding ISBs with the announcement

of the temporary suspension of repayment of

certain external debt of the Government from

mid-April 2022. The outstanding liability position of

direct investments, which witnessed a significant

increase in 2021 due to a substantial increase in

market prices of a number of DIEs listed in the

CSE, recorded a notable reduction with the decline

in market prices of these publicly listed companies

in 2022. The Central Bank’s outstanding currency

and deposit liability position increased during the

year with the receipt of an international swap facility

of US dollars 400 million from the RBI. Further, the

Central Bank and the Bangladesh Bank agreed to

rollover the swap facility of US dollars 200 million,

to be settled in 2023. Meanwhile, there was a

marginal decrease in the currency and deposit

liability position of deposit taking corporations

during the year. Further, there was a notable decline

in the outstanding foreign loan liability position of

commercial banks, as banks continued to reduce

their foreign liability exposure, particularly during

the latter part of the year. The outstanding foreign

loan liability position of the Government increased,

despite the announcement of the debt standstill,

partly due to the receipt of a significant amount of

emergency humanitarian assistance in the form

of credit lines from India. Further, there was a

significant increase in liabilities denominated as

other accounts payable of the Central Bank, due to

the deferment of settling the ACU liabilities during

the year. Meanwhile, the Central Bank continued

to repay the outstanding liability relating to

IMF-EFF arrangement obtained during 2015-2019.

The outstanding foreign loan liability position of

the private sector, other than SOBEs, remained

at similar levels during the year. In terms of

liabilities of SOBEs, the Cabinet of Ministers

granted approval to reclassify the foreign loan

liabilities of several SOBEs that were thus far

categorised under ‘Other Sectors’ of the IIP and

loan liabilities. Accordingly, part of outstanding

were only moderate foreign exchange inflows in

2022 other than the international swap facility

from the RBI, inflows linked to ACU liabilities

that remain unpaid, emergency credit lines of

humanitarian assistance from India, and project

loans and emergency assistance from multilateral

institutions. Consequently, the GOR level at end

2022 was equivalent to 1.2 months of merchandise

imports in comparison to the import cover of 1.8

months at end 2021.

The GOR level remained at critical levels

due to the significant liquidity shortage in the

domestic foreign exchange market and lack

of access to foreign financing sources. The

external sector was significantly strained due to

the significant liquidity shortage in the domestic

foreign exchange market, lack of access to

foreign financing sources, and the critically

low level of GOR. In this context, to gradually

build-up GOR, the Central Bank continued to

maintain the mandatory sales requirement from

licensed banks (LBs) to the Central Bank from the

converted workers' remittances and compulsorily

converted export proceeds in 2022. In addition,

the Central Bank also absorbed forex from the

banking system on an intermittent basis in 2022

by establishing fuel and coal funds specifically

to facilitate the financing of imports of fuel and

coal. Accordingly, the Central Bank supplied US

dollars 2,716 million to the domestic forex market

to primarily facilitate the importation of essential

imports, such as fuel, coal, LP gas, medicine,

and essential food. This was accomplished by

utilising the foreign exchange mobilised through

the mandatory sales by LBs to the Central Bank,

from the conversions on account of workers’

remittances and export proceeds, as well as

foreign exchange absorbed to the fuel and coal

funds. These measures helped meet the basic

needs of the country, even in the absence of

specific bridging finances in 2022, thereby

minimising the adverse impact of the BOP crisis

to a certain extent. Further, the Central Bank

continued with servicing foreign currency debt

service payments of both the Central Bank and

the Government, amounting to US dollars 3,237

million in 2022. These debt servicing included the

external debt obligations to multilateral agencies

that were continued to be honoured in 2022,

despite the announcement of the debt standstill

in mid-April 2022, causing a significant drain from

GOR in 2022.

declined in 2022 mainly due to the decline in

official reserves, although holdings of foreign

assets of deposit taking corporations recorded an

increase. Total foreign assets of the country were

equivalent to 3.9 months of merchandise imports

by end 2022, compared to 3.6 months of imports

by end 2021.

5.7 External Debt and Debt Servicing

5.7.1 External Debt

Sri Lanka’s external debt reduced by end

2022, mainly due to the significant reduction

in the market values of ISBs that were issued

by the Government. Total external debt of the

country amounted to US dollars 49,678 million at

end 2022, compared to US dollars 51,775 million

by end of 2021. Despite a notable increase in the

outstanding foreign loans, the total external debt

of the Government remained at similar levels, due

to the reduction in the outstanding value of ISBs

issued by the Government, which are valued at

market prices. Although the temporary suspension

of foreign loans of the Government other than

loans due to multilateral lenders provided some

respite in terms of lesser foreign loan repayments,

the Government obtained a number of emergency

credit facilities for the importation of essential goods

including fuel, medicine and fertiliser, from India, in

the form of bilateral loans, resulting in a significant

increase in foreign loan disbursements as a whole

during 2022. Further, accrued interest of project

loans and ISB coupon payments that are in arrears

due to the suspension of servicing of selected

external debt since mid-April 2022, have also been

included in the outstanding debt of respective debt

instruments.4 This has resulted in further increasing

outstanding government foreign loan liabilities,

despite the lack of commercial borrowings by the

Government subsequent to the debt standstill. The

outstanding external debt of the Central Bank also

recorded a significant increase with the receipt of an

international swap facility from the RBI, categorised

under currency and deposits, and the accumulation

of ACU liabilities categorised under ‘other accounts

payable’. However, the outstanding external debt of

deposit taking corporations declined significantly,

with commercial banks reducing their outstanding

foreign loans, and currency and deposit liability

exposure, particularly in the latter part of the year.

The commercial banks were unable to access

credit lines with the sovereign ratings downgrade in

the aftermath of the debt standstill, while continuing

to repay existing debt liabilities, contributing to

the reduction of the external debt of the banking

sector. The outstanding external debt of private

corporations also declined, mainly as a result of

reduced outstanding liabilities in terms of trade

credits owed by the CPC. Further, outstanding

external debt of several SOBEs was reclassified as

outstanding external debt of the Government by end

2022, with a decision by the Cabinet of Ministers

to reclassify such loans with the recommendations

of the IMF. These loans included loans related

to the Hambantota Port Development Project,

Mattala Hambantota International Airport Project

and the Puttalam Coal power project, resulting in

a notable reduction in outstanding foreign loans

under the ‘other sector’ of external debt statistics.

Further, accrued interest also accumulated with

the non-repayment of a coupon payment of an

international debt security issued by SriLankan

Airlines. Meanwhile, outstanding external debt of

direct investment enterprises recorded an increase

during the year.

The total outstanding external debt of the

country, as a percentage of GDP, increased

during the year. As a percentage of GDP, the total

outstanding external debt stood at 64.5 per cent as at end 2022, compared to 58.5 per cent as

at end 2021. This increase is mainly due to the

significant contraction in the nominal GDP value

expressed in US dollar terms, despite a significant

contraction in the nominal value of the total external

debt during the year. Further, the outstanding

external debt position of the Government out of

the total external debt position also increased to

55.4 per cent as at end 2022, compared to 53.2

per cent as at end 2021. In terms of the debt

maturity profile, long term debt as a percentage of

total external debt stood at 84.6 per cent as at end

2022, compared to 83.7 per cent as at end 2021.

Introduction

The phenomenon of concurrent deficits in the Government budget and the external current account, emanating from the imbalances caused by excessive spending over and above a country’s capacity, popularly known as Twin Deficits has remained the major structural impediment and key source of macroeconomic vulnerability in Sri Lanka for many years. Sri Lanka has been experiencing persistent external current account deficits mainly driven by large deficits in the merchandise trade account and primary income account over the years. Although the trade in services account and secondary income account (mainly workers’ remittances) recorded surpluses, these surpluses have not been adequate to cushion the impact of ever widening deficits in the merchandise trade and primary income accounts in the current account. Further, Sri Lanka failed to attract non-debt creating foreign financial flows, such as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), up to the expected levels even during the post war era due to structural and policy impediments. Moreover, during the last decade, the mounting external debt of the country and the resultant large debt service payments were major contributors to the external sector imbalances worsening debt sustainability concerns. Amidst these structural weaknesses in the external sector, imprudent and swift policy changes on the fiscal front, the COVID-19 pandemic, and related uncertainties intensified its macroeconomic fragilities leading to a series of calamities. Gross official reserves declined to historical lows, with the liquid reserves falling to almost zero levels by April 2022 and the exchange rate underwent a large overshooting in early March 2022. Against this backdrop, the Government announced a debt standstill in April 2022 for an interim period, pending a debt restructuring process while commencing negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a financing arrangement. As Sri Lanka’s debt is evaluated as unsustainable, the success of the IMF-Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement relies on the progress of ongoing debt restructuring. Once debt restructuring perimeters are negotiated and agreed upon with Sri Lanka’s official and private creditors, the country will resume debt servicing, but on a smaller scale, with extended maturities. This first ever debt restructuring

BOX 8Post-Debt Restructuring Policy Priorities for Strengthening External Sector Balance

effort would offer a once in a lifetime opportunity for the country to correct past mistakes and decisively plan future actions to ensure that the country will not suffer from a repeated debt restructuring episode, as experienced by some countries. This stresses the fact that not only the debt restructuring process, but also the way forward in the post restructuring economy should be well planned and executed to strengthen the country’s fiscal and external positions and build resilience in the period ahead.

Challenges in Debt Restructuring Processes

From the 1950s to 2010 there were more than 600 incidents of sovereign debt restructuring globally involving 95 countries (Das, Papaioannou, & Trebesch, 2012). Generally, it is expected that following successful debt restructuring, a country would manage the debt sustainably going forward and recover gradually. However, out of those, not all countries were able to sustainably manage their debt after a successful debt restructuring process and those who failed experienced further defaults subsequently. There are several reasons why some countries fail to reach their potential level of economic growth and ensure external sector stability through debt restructuring, as described below:

1. Unfavourable economic conditions: The external environment and broader economic conditions of the country during the rebuilding phase are instrumental in determining the outcome of debt restructuring. For example, if the global economy is slowing down or if major trading partners are experiencing an economic contraction during the post debt restructuring phase, the country may struggle to achieve its potential level of growth and Balance of Payments (BOP) sustainability. There are early signs that global economic stresses could heighten in 2023 amidst tight monetary and financial market conditions, making the post debt restructuring recovery of Sri Lanka challenging.

2. Implementation challenges: Given the diversity of external lenders and their interests as well as geopolitical concerns, the negotiation and implementation phases of debt restructuring could

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022

188

5

be complex. This could make reaching agreements with creditors challenging, thereby raising the risk of delays due to lengthy negotiations. A protracted restructuring process could further erode investor confidence and be a major predicament for regaining stability of the external sector.

3. Insufficient policy measures: Recovery in the economy following debt restructuring involves adopting a policy combination that drives the economy towards a sustainable growth path in the short and medium term with emphasis on macro-fiscal reforms and required adjustments. However, if the policy responses are not planned out effectively or lack coordination in implementation, the desired outcome may not be achieved. Considering the legacy issues faced by the external sector of Sri Lanka, the reforms package needs to be sufficiently robust.

4. Political instability: The recovery in the economy following a debt restructuring process essentially depends on the success of the implementation of the reform package agreed upon with creditors and adherence to targets set out therein. As the major economic reforms lack popularity, governments come under severe pressure to implement such reforms and would possibly give into lobbying from the constituency. Political stability would help rebuild confidence in the economy among the stakeholders, including investors, multilateral and bilateral lenders, and creditors. Further, political instability may lead to policy inconsistency, which could be a major setback to implementing sustainable macroeconomic adjustments. Thus, post restructuring economic revival and resilience would be conditional on the continuation of the political resolve as well as public support for reforms.

5. Weak institutions: Weak institutions that lead to deterioration of the rule of law, lack of transparency and accountability, and increased corruption could create an environment that is unfavourable to economic growth, while limiting the effectiveness of policy measures and eroding investor confidence.

Against this backdrop, it will be pertinent to form a vigorous policy framework that aims at restoring stability in the external sector, while creating a conducive environment for the economic activities to thrive. Accordingly, a clear strategy needs to be articulated by

the Government to implement the necessary structural reforms at the earliest possible timeframe and to source financing to repay debt obligations to creditors when the moratoria and concessions provided by creditors under the debt restructuring process come to a close and the debt obligations become due, in order to circumvent the need for repeated access to IMF bailouts and further rounds of debt restructuring in the future. Building permanent buffers on the external sector is the key to achieving a country’s macroeconomic resilience. Such buffers could be a combined result of strengthening the external current and financial accounts through coordinated national policy drive and moving away from the orientation towards debt financing the budget deficit and current account deficit.

Policies for Strengthening the External Current Account

Sri Lanka’s exports in the last few decades have seen no major growth drive or boom due to legacy issues, such as limited diversification, low value addition, lower integration to global value chains, and the lack of sophistication required to remain competitive amidst the overvalued exchange rate and inadequate investments in the tradable sector. In the meantime, expenditure on all categories of imports have increased at a faster pace leading to widening trade deficits, especially since 2011, mainly financed through external sector borrowings. Accordingly, any effort in addressing the external current account deficit should be focused on strategies to reduce the trade deficit by simultaneous measures to increase the earnings from merchandise exports while increasing the surplus in the services account. Demand management measures through rationalisation of imports and efforts on import substitution may be introduced only on a temporary basis to preserve economic stability, as long term adaptation of such measures might undermine the competitiveness of the economy. Further, product diversification through research and development led innovation, vertical and horizontal integration, participation in production sharing networks and linking with the global value chains through component manufacturing as well as reducing over reliance on traditional markets as export destinations by way of exploring new markets could be considered as vital initiatives. The export sector would have to be supported by conducive macroeconomic policies, particularly by maintaining a flexible exchange rate, consistent tax and

investment policies, price stability and a thereby less volatile interest rate structure, and essential infrastructure facilities. Speedy and uninterrupted implementation of the actions outlined in the National Export Strategy is essential in the national interest to achieve the intended outcomes. Policy measures aimed at promoting domestic industries that supply intermediate goods required for key exports should be implemented promptly to enhance the domestic value addition in the export sector, while effectively substituting imports through integration. A level playing field created through free trade agreements would be an added advantage. Further, initiatives focused on moving towards renewable energy sources would also reduce the country’s reliance on fossil fuels in the medium to long term thereby helping to minimise the pressure on the current account stemming from fuel imports.

Meanwhile, services exports are vital in cushioning the deficit in the external current account, and hence it is imperative to exploit their full potential. As the largest service export sector, the tourism sector is showing signs of revival and to reap the maximum benefits of the tourism industry, it is imperative to diversify the tourism sector to focus more on niche and non-traditional markets and tourists that travel for different purposes other than leisure. Also, certain services exports, especially in the Information Technology/Business Process Outsourcing (IT/BPO) sector, have considerable potential to bringing in net foreign exchange flows to the country. Growth opportunities in the IT/BPO sectors have expanded with the increased digitalisation of economies worldwide following the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, Sri Lanka should capitalise on the availability of a skilled labour force and state-of-the-art IT infrastructure to promote itself as a digital nation. Also, secondary and tertiary IT education needs to be aligned to market demands and complement the development of human capital required to keep up with the expansion in this sector. With debt restructuring, the primary income deficit is also expected to improve and needs to create a surplus in the non-interest income account.

Promotion of workers’ remittance requires active stakeholder engagement to promote foreign employment, diversifying the foreign employment market and upskilling of migrant employees to secure more foreign employment opportunities with higher earning potential and incentivising official flows of remittances

facilitated by low cost, real time, and convenient cross border fund flows. Although Sri Lanka has benefitted from workers’ remittances sourced from the Middle Eastern region in the past, it is timely to promote alternative destinations offering employment for a wide range of job categories with high wage potential, especially in advanced economies, such as South Korea, Singapore, Japan, and European countries, thereby increasing the quantum of workers’ remittances while reducing geopolitically driven vulnerabilities of remittance receipts. In the meantime, the large scale migration of white collar employees from Sri Lanka on a permanent basis, which will have a negative effect on workers remittances as well as long term economic repercussions due to brain drain, would have to be addressed urgently.

Policies for Strengthening External Financial Inflows

In addition to the targeted measures to address broader current account deficits, it is also necessary to supplement them by attracting more non-debt capital receipts, such as FDI and portfolio investments, into the financial account of the BOP in order to ensure greater external sector stability and improved macroeconomic stability. Attracting non-debt obligatory foreign financial inflows to improve external sector resilience will be instrumental in ensuring lasting stability of the external sector, amidst continuous foreign currency debt servicing requirements and lack of fiscal space for debt repayment. Beyond supporting the financing of the current account deficit and augmenting domestic investment, FDI fosters economic growth by generating technology spillovers, supporting human capital development, and enhancing international trade linkages through improved access to foreign markets. Sri Lanka’s FDI remained acutely low compared to its regional peers over the past decades due to several legal, structural, and institutional deficiencies, such as rigid labour market regulations, difficulties in obtaining utilities, complex and inconsistent tax structures, and laborious regulatory structures, particularly related to contract enforcement, export import documentation, business startups, property acquisition, and the lack of well developed infrastructure facilities. Apart from these factors, policy uncertainty, institutional and governance weaknesses, such as perceived corruption and coordination failures continue to pose impediments to creating a conducive investment

climate in Sri Lanka. Therefore, in order to foster investor confidence, Sri Lanka needs to establish a transparent and effective policy environment by articulating a comprehensive investment policy and build the required human competencies and institutional capacities to implement policy actions. Harmonisation of foreign investment policy with other development policies and strategies, such as trade and industrial policies as well as inter agency coordination in implementing these policies remain equally important. FDI and its fringe benefits will be instrumental in helping the economy to recover in the medium to long term under the macro-fiscal adjustment programme not only by contributing to the growth drive but also through economy wide efficiency gains. While efforts have already been taken to rectify these concerns by relevant authorities, it is imperative to expedite the implementation process before global FDI flows resume to pre-pandemic levels.

There is also a need to limit commercial project financing and encourage financing of tradable sectors capable of generating foreign exchange to service debt. A clear and transparent evaluation and selection mechanism for external loans should be established, while improving the transparency and accountability to the public on the external borrowing, their usage, and economic implications in order to enhance the effective utilisation of the borrowings and to reduce the pressure in the domestic foreign exchange market and external reserves of the country. Further, it is needed to articulate a strategy to improve sovereign ratings to reduce high risk premiums associated with external borrowings. Nevertheless, as country ratings improve in the period ahead, the tendency for increasing the share of commercial borrowings in the overall debt portfolio needs to be prevented. It is also possible to seek the feasibility of exploring the low cost funding options for essential projects, such as those in the areas of energy and food security, and climate adoption through sustainable financing options widely being made available globally while the use of green financing options would be beneficial. The IMF-EFF arrangement gives the opportunity to enhance market sentiments to attract foreign funds to the country which would support building up official reserves. Authorities need to restore debt sustainability by meeting targets setout over the medium to long term, such as by reducing the level of public debt below 95 per cent of GDP by 2032,

reducing the average central government Gross

Financing Needs (GFNs) in 2027–32, including the

materialisation of contingent liabilities below 13 per cent

of GDP so that rollover risks under stress are

manageable, keeping foreign exchange debt servicing

of the central government below 4.5 per cent of GDP

in any year during 2027-32, and ensuring that the

fiscal and external financing gaps are closed.

Conclusion

In view of the above, the implementation of structural

reforms focusing not only on restoring near term

stability but also on rebuilding the nation with adequate

safeguards and resilience in the post-debt restructuring

and post-IMF bailout era is vitally important for

permanent revival from the current economic crisis.

The persistent twin deficits experienced by Sri Lanka

highlights the importance of addressing the BOP issues

on a sustainable basis through a comprehensive national

policy package formed in consultation with the relevant

stakeholders and guarded from influences of changing

political regimes. Further, non-debt creating foreign

exchange generating sources need to be explored and

encouraged, while reducing the need for financing of

the current account deficit out of commercial external

debt. Also, according to international experiences,

the level of commitment by authorities towards the

success of a reform programme is a key determinant

of the outcome of debt restructuring and subsequent

recovery of the economy. Moreover, the ongoing efforts

to resolve the economic issues, including the debt

restructuring process, and the macro-fiscal adjustment

programme under the IMF-EFF arrangement are

necessary conditions for the way forward, though these

alone would not guarantee a permanent solution to

the country’s deep rooted structural weaknesses and

macroeconomic complications unless the financing

mix of government budget deficits and external current

account deficits is augmented with non-debt creating

financing in the period ahead.

5.7.2 Foreign Debt Service Payments

External debt repayments in 2022, compiled

in terms of actual debt repayment of capital and

interest in 2022, excluding arrears, recorded

a significant reduction, with the temporary

suspension of servicing of selected external

debt since mid-April 2022. This reduction in debt

servicing was mainly due to the non-payment of

capital and interest payments to non-residents other

than multilateral institutions by the Government,

including bilateral foreign loans, and an ISB due

to commercial creditors. Accordingly, total external

debt service payments in 2022 amounted to US

dollars 2,471 million, compared to US dollars

4,597 million in 2021. Capital repayments by the

Government during 2022 amounted to US dollars

1,236 million, compared to US dollars 2,377

million in 2021. Further, interest repayment by the

Government during 2022 amounted to US dollars

465 million, compared to US dollars 1,187 million

in 2021. Only foreign loans due to multilateral

institutions were repaid by the Government after the

temporary suspension of servicing external debt.

The Central Bank continued to service dues to the

IMF under the previous EFF facility, while rolling

over existing international swap arrangements

with regional central banks. Meanwhile, the private

sector continued to repay their foreign loan liabilities

as usual. However, some SOBEs that had obtained

foreign loans, repaid the foreign liabilities partially,

and were affected by the debt suspension by the

Government. These SOBEs include the National

Water Supply and Drainage Board, Ceylon

Electricity Board, Telecommunications Regulatory

Commission of Sri Lanka and Airport and Aviation

Services of Sri Lanka, while some of these

non-repaid SOBE debt was reclassified to general

government debt as mentioned in Section 5.7.1.

5.8 Exchange Rate Movements

The Sri Lanka rupee experienced high

volatility and registered the historically largest

depreciation against the US dollar during the

first half of 2022, before stabilising around

the guidance band introduced in May 2022.

The Central Bank’s intervention in the domestic

foreign exchange market and the continued use

of moral suasion helped maintain the Sri Lanka

rupee in the range of Rs.200-203 per US dollar

during early 2022. However, significant shortage in

liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market,

the widening spread between the official exchange

rate and ‘grey market rate,’ and worsening

global conditions continued to exert pressures

on the exchange rate, necessitating a measured

adjustment in the exchange rate that was allowed

in early March 2022. However, the subsequent

large overshooting of the exchange rate by market

forces, amidst uncertainties, caused the Sri Lanka

rupee to depreciate substantially by 41.4 per cent

against the US dollar by end April 2022. To reduce

this significant volatility driven by excessive

speculation and its adverse spillover effects on the

economy, the Central Bank introduced a variation

band, announced on a daily basis, as a temporary

measure to manage the intraday volatility in

the exchange rate. This helped curtail large

fluctuations of the exchange rate, mostly driven

by excessive speculation, amidst unprecedented

BOP pressures. According to this new exchange

rate determination arrangement, which was

introduced from 13 May 2022, a middle exchange

rate was announced by the Central Bank based

on the weighted average spot market exchange

rate of the USD/LKR interbank transactions, with

a variation margin on either side of the middle spot

exchange rate. Consequently, from 13 May 2022 to

end December 2022, the Sri Lanka rupee recorded

only a marginal depreciation against the US dollar.

The inactive spot market, due to market uncertainties

about the country’s economic conditions, largely

explained the broadly stable exchange rate during

this period. Accordingly, the annual depreciation

of the rupee was limited to 44.8 per cent against

the US dollar during 2022. Meanwhile, the Central

Bank supplied US dollars 568 million to the domestic

foreign exchange market on a net basis during 2022,

compared to a net supply of US dollars 747 million

in 2021. Reflecting cross currency exchange rate

movements, the Sri Lanka rupee depreciated against

the euro (41.4 per cent), the pound sterling (38.1 per

cent), Japanese yen (36.4 per cent) and the Indian

rupee (38.6 per cent) by end 2022. The activity in

the domestic foreign exchange market registered a

notable improvement since late 2022 with increasing

foreign exchange liquidity, positive developments

on the finalisation of the EFF arrangement from

the IMF, significant moderation of import demand

amidst subdued activity and tight credit conditions,

among others. With a view to encouraging activity

in the domestic forex market and restoring a market

driven exchange rate in line with the flexible inflation

targeting framework of the Central Bank, the Central

Bank commenced a gradual relaxation of the daily

variation band, while also loosening the mandatory

sales requirement. In consequence, the Central

Bank lowered the mandatory forex sales requirement

from conversions of export proceeds and workers’

remittances, from 25 per cent to 15 per cent,

on 27 February 2023, as the first step to allow

increased foreign exchange liquidity in the banking

system, followed by gradual widening of the variation

band for the exchange rate. With these measures,

steady foreign currency inflows to the services

sector, workers’ remittances and financial flows to

portfolio investments and return of market confidence

towards the finalisation of the IMF-EFF arrangement

contributed towards a notable appreciation of the

exchange rate during early March 2023, correcting the

exchange rate overshooting witnessed in early 2022.

However, the Central Bank intervened in the domestic

foreign exchange market to allow for an orderly

appreciation of the exchange rate amidst significant

appreciation pressures in a relatively short period

of time. Accordingly, the Central Bank purchased

foreign exchange from the market amounting to US

dollars 451 million on a gross basis during March

2023. Meanwhile, the Central Bank announced the

complete removal of the guidance band and the

mandatory sales requirement by licensed banks with

effect from 7 March 2023. As a combined impact of

these relaxation measures and enhanced external

sector outlook in the near term, the Sri Lanka rupee

appreciated gradually by 10.9 per cent to Rs. 327.29

per US dollar by end March 2023.

Other major currencies depreciated against

the US dollar in line with the broad-based

strengthening of the US dollar, amidst policy

rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve Bank.

Accordingly, at the end of 2022, the euro (5.9 per cent),

the Japanese yen (13.2 per cent), the pound sterling

(10.8 per cent), and Indian rupee (10.1 per cent)

depreciated against the US dollar. Even though the

Sri Lanka rupee depreciated against the SDR by

41.9 per cent during 2022 due to the combined effect

of the depreciation of the rupee against most major

currencies, the Sri Lanka rupee appreciated against

the SDR by 9.8 per cent by end March 2023, with

the appreciation of the rupee against most major

currencies during the first quarter of 2023.

the nominal depreciation of the Sri Lanka

rupee against the selected major currencies

together with the movements in cross currency

exchange rates. Accordingly, the 5-currency

NEER index declined by 41.1 per cent, while

the 24-currency index declined by 40.6 per cent

in 2022. Meanwhile, REER, which indicates Sri

Lanka’s external competitiveness, measured by

the 5-currency and 24-currency indices, dropped

during the year, by 13.5 per cent and 44.5 per cent,

respectively. Overall, the REER indices remained

remarkably below the threshold of 100 index

points (2017=100), indicating that the exchange

rate remained supportive of the country’s trade

competitiveness. With the sharp appreciation of

the exchange rate in March 2023, both NEER and

REER indices increased substantially, reflecting

the nominal appreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee

against the US dollar and other major currencies

considered in the basket. Accordingly, 5-currency

NEER indices increased by 9.4 per cent and

5-currency REER decreased by 15.5 per cent, and

24-currency NEER and REER indices increased

by 10.3 per cent and 10.0 per cent, respectively,

by end March 2023.

5.8.2 Developments in the Domestic Foreign Exchange Market

The transaction volumes in the domestic

foreign exchange market further declined in

2022, compared to 2021. The volume of interbank

foreign exchange transactions declined to

US dollars 9,570 million in 2022, in comparison

to US dollars 12,160 million in 2021. The total

volume of spot transactions declined to US dollars

5,479 million (57.3 per cent of total transactions)

in 2022, in comparison to US dollars 5,852 million

in 2021. The total volume of forward transactions

decreased to US dollars 4,091 million in 2022 from

US dollars 6,308 million in 2021. Meanwhile, the

Central Bank intervened in the domestic foreign

exchange market by supplying US dollars 568

million, on a net basis, in 2022. This was a result

of purchases of US dollars 2,148 million and a

supply of US dollars 2,716 million. The purchase

of foreign exchange from the market was mainly

through mandatory sales by licensed banks on

the conversion of export proceeds and workers’

remittances, while the sale of foreign exchange

by the Central Bank was on account of facilitating

import of essential commodities. The Central Bank

intervened in the domestic foreign exchange market

during the first quarter of 2023 by purchasing

US dollars 861 million, on a net basis in order

to mitigate excessive volatility in the exchange

rate, while strengthening gross official reserves.
