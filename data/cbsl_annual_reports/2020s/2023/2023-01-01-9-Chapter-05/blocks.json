The current account deficit widened due to the increased imports led by the normalisation of economic activities, moderation in tourism earnings and slowdown in workers\u2019 remittances. Downgrading of the sovereign credit ratings of the country constrained the access to global capital markets despite high debt servicing requirements, further aggravating the situation. In view of mounting imbalances in the external sector due to the lack of foreign exchange inflows, several measures were taken to improve foreign currency liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market and to replenish international reserves. These included establishing rules (Table B 7.1) mandating repatriation of export proceeds to the country within 180 days and conversion of such receipts into Sri Lanka rupees under the provisions of the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949 (MLA) in 2021, with a view to effectively enforcing such requirements.",

Having identified the importance of the exports, successive Governments in Sri Lanka have put in place policies that are conducive for building a vibrant exports sector. However, to obtain the maximum benefits of the export sector, a country needs to ensure that export proceeds are repatriated so that there would be no strain on the Balance of Payments. The requirement to repatriate export proceeds into Sri Lanka was initially imposed during 1973 under the repealed Exchange Control Act No. 24 of 1953 (ECA) and continued until 1993. This requirement for repatriation and surrender was liberalised subsequent to accepting Article VIII of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Articles of Agreement in 1994, as part of further liberalisation of current account transactions and continuation of the country\u2019s stabilisation programme. Accordingly, exporters were permitted to repatriate export proceeds and hold those in rupee or foreign currency accounts in Sri Lanka or retain them in foreign currency accounts in a bank abroad. However, the repatriation",

Similarly, inflows from other foreign exchange sources which are sold to ADs, such as workers\u2019 remittances, tourism earnings and foreign investments flows will also contribute to increase the domestic market liquidity. The banking system needs to accommodate various foreign exchange requirements of its customers, both of current and capital nature, for which the foreign currency so purchased will be utilised. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) may build up its reserves by purchasing foreign exchange from the domestic foreign exchange market.

    "text": "The phenomenon of concurrent deficits in the Government budget and the external current account, emanating from the imbalances caused by excessive spending over and above a country\u2019s capacity, popularly known as Twin Deficits has remained the major structural impediment and key source of macroeconomic vulnerability in Sri Lanka for many years. Sri Lanka has been experiencing persistent external current account deficits mainly driven by large deficits in the merchandise trade account and primary income account over the years. Although the trade in services account and secondary income account (mainly workers\u2019 remittances) recorded surpluses, these surpluses have not been adequate to cushion the impact of ever widening deficits in the merchandise trade and primary income accounts in the current account. Further, Sri Lanka failed to attract non-debt creating foreign financial flows, such as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), up to the expected levels even during the post war era due to structural and policy impediments. Moreover, during the last decade, the mounting external debt of the country and the resultant large debt service payments were major contributors to the external sector imbalances worsening debt sustainability concerns. Amidst these structural weaknesses in the external sector, imprudent and swift policy changes on the fiscal front, the COVID-19 pandemic, and related uncertainties intensified its macroeconomic fragilities leading to a series of calamities. Gross official reserves declined to historical lows, with the liquid reserves falling to almost zero levels by April 2022 and the exchange rate underwent a large overshooting in early March 2022. Against this backdrop, the Government announced a debt standstill in April 2022 for an interim period, pending a debt restructuring process while commencing negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a financing arrangement. As Sri Lanka\u2019s debt is evaluated as unsustainable, the success of the IMF-Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement relies on the progress of ongoing debt restructuring. Once debt restructuring perimeters are negotiated and agreed upon with Sri Lanka\u2019s official and private creditors, the country will resume debt servicing, but on a smaller scale, with extended maturities. This first ever debt restructuring",

However, out of those, not all countries were able to sustainably manage their debt after a successful debt restructuring process and those who failed experienced further defaults subsequently.

In the meantime, expenditure on all categories of imports have increased at a faster pace leading to widening trade deficits, especially since 2011, mainly financed through external sector borrowings. Accordingly, any effort in addressing the external current account deficit should be focused on strategies to reduce the trade deficit by simultaneous measures to increase the earnings from merchandise exports while increasing the surplus in the services account. Demand management measures through rationalisation of imports and efforts on import substitution may be introduced only on a temporary basis to preserve economic stability, as long term adaptation of such measures might undermine the competitiveness of the economy. Further, product diversification through research and development led innovation, vertical and horizontal integration, participation in production sharing networks and linking with the global value chains through component manufacturing as well as reducing over reliance on traditional markets as export destinations by way of exploring new markets could be considered as vital initiatives.

Nevertheless, as country ratings improve in the period ahead, the tendency for increasing the share of commercial borrowings in the overall debt portfolio needs to be prevented. It is also possible to seek the feasibility of exploring the low cost funding options for essential projects, such as those in the areas of energy and food security, and climate adoption through sustainable financing options widely being made available globally while the use of green financing options would be beneficial.
