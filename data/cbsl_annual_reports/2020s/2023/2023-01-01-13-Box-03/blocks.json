Accordingly, the objectives were streamlined to two core objectives, namely, the maintenance of economic and price stability and financial system stability.",

Hence, several provisions of the MLA, amidst economic developments and the evolution of central banking in general, necessitated reassessment and amendments in line with the international best practices. This paved the way for the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act (CBA) to be drafted to include provisions strengthening the Central Bank independence, enhancing transparency and accountability and strengthening the monetary policy framework to ensure sustained price stability in Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, the CBA is also expected to strengthen the financial sector and macroprudential oversight and improve the governance of the Central Bank.

Such an environment allows an economy to achieve its growth potential. Further, in pursuing the primary objective, the Central Bank shall take into account the stabilisation of output towards its potential level. These arrangements are in accordance with the Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) framework that aims at stabilising inflation around the inflation target while minimising disturbance to the real economy. Further, on a rare occasion where the attention of both price stability and financial system stability is required, and the policy decision concerning either side is subject to a tradeoff, the Central Bank is expected to prioritise its primary object of price stability.",
