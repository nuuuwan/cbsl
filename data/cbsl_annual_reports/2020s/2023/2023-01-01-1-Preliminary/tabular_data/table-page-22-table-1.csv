"Definitions and Explanatory Notes on Statistical Tables"
"The following general notes supplement the footnotes given below the individual tables:
1.   In an attempt to bring the material up-to-date, provisional figures are included in some tables.
2.   Figures in some tables have been rounded off to the nearest final digit. Hence, there may be  
      a slight discrepancy between the total as shown and the sum of its components.
3.   Differences as compared with previously published figures are due to subsequent revisions.
4.   Values indicated within parenthesis are negative values.
5.   The following symbols have been used throughout:-
                  ...         =   negligible
                  -           =   nil
                  n.a.      =   not available
                  n.e.c.    =   not elsewhere classified
                  n.e.s.    =   not elsewhere specified
                  n.i.e.     =   not included elsewhere"
