"1.1 Overview"
"The Sri Lankan economy faced its most onerous year in its post-independence history in 2022, comprising"
"the vast citizenry in the near term, they were necessary to safeguard the economy and economic agents from"
"potentially devastating consequences of unrestrained economic instability, such as hyperinflation, collapse of"
"economic activity to a much deeper level, and a complete disconnect of the country from the rest of the world,"
"with far worse consequences to the people and businesses. The outcomes of these efforts have eventuated"
"since late 2022. The country managed to transition to a workable equilibrium in the near term, focused on"
"restoring socio-economic stability, while the envisaged assistance from the international financial institutions"
"begins to materialise."
"Having run an unsustainable macroeconomic model in tandem with the longstanding deficits in the budget"
"balance and the external current account, the economy had fully exhausted its buffers by early 2022 as it was"
"straddled by a myriad of vulnerabilities that emanated from both global and domestic sources. Several inherent"
"weaknesses of the economy, further exacerbated by policy lapses, steered the country towards a multifaceted"
"disaster.  Ill-timed  tax  reductions,  an  ill-equipped  attempt  to  swiftly  adopt  organic  agriculture,  the  depletion"
"of the countryâ€™s official reserves amidst futile attempts to maintain an untarnished debt servicing record, the"
"delay in the exchange rate adjustment, and the failure to pay heed to several early warning signals caused"
"tremendous shockwaves across the economy. Consequently, the economy was battered by excessive balance"
"of payments (BOP) pressures with acute shortage of foreign exchange liquidity and pressured exchange rate,"
"spiralling inflation and dampened economic activity amidst mass loss of livelihoods, large fiscal imbalances,"
"public debt reaching unsustainable levels with extraordinarily high risk premia, devastating sovereign rating"
"downgrades that constrained access to external finance, unprecedented heightening of socio-economic and"
"socio-political  tensions,  and  rapidly  deteriorating  business  confidence,  among  others.  Businesses  and  the"
"general public alike were in severe distress amidst shortages and rationing of essentials, the ballooning cost"
"of living and cost of production, and the loss of welfare and livelihoods. Consequently, the rapid unfolding of"
"social unrest resulted in political instability, warranting an urgent need for redefining policy priorities to steer"
"the economy away from further turmoil."
"Amidst mounting BOP pressures, the exchange rate was allowed a measured adjustment in early March"
"2022. However, the subsequent floating of the exchange rate resulted in an overshooting, fuelled by speculative"
"activity.  The  Central  Bank  adopted  aggressive  monetary  policy  tightening  in  April  2022  to  rein  in  demand"
"pressures,  complemented  by  a  robust  communication  strategy  aimed  at  anchoring  inflation  expectations,"
"while taking measures to stabilise the exchange rate amidst exhausted levels of useable reserves by April"
