"","CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2022"
"","2022. Meanwhile, the Central Bank provided foreign exchange to the market to meet the demand for essential"
"","imports to the greatest extent possible amidst a dearth of foreign exchange inflows and significantly low levels"
"","of official reserves. Moreover, the Central Bank initiated measures to prioritise essential imports and restrict"
"","capital outflows through appropriate control measures, while continuing the requirement for the mandatory"
"1","sale  of  foreign  exchange  to  the  Central  Bank  by  licensed  banks,  based  on  the  conversion  of  repatriated"
"",""
"","foreign exchange, and commenced providing daily guidance on the exchange rate to curtail undue intraday"
"","volatilities.  Moreover,  the  Central  Bank’s  continuous  financial  sector  oversight  and  adoption  of  appropriate"
"","regulatory  measures  along  with  effective  communication  ensured  financial  system  stability  amidst  severe"
"","socio-economic distress."
"","The  Government  initiated  measures  in  early  2022  to  seek  assistance  from  the  International  Monetary"
"","Fund (IMF) after months of indecisiveness. The IMF had already assessed that Sri Lanka’s public debt had"
"","reached unsustainable levels, hence, any funding assistance from the IMF needed to be preceded by efforts to"
"","restructure public debt. Subsequently, when it reached a critical point of inability to service debt payments, the"
"","Government announced a debt standstill in mid-April 2022, thereby suspending the servicing of external debt,"
"","mainly bilateral and commercial debt, as an interim measure, while soliciting support from official and private"
"","creditors to restructure outstanding debt. Simultaneously, several initiatives were made by the Government"
"","to enhance government revenue,  curtail expenditure, introduce reforms to  major  State  Owned Enterprises"
"","(SOE), implement import controls, and ration energy supply, while exploring bridging finance from bilateral"
"","and multilateral partners for essential expenditures as well as supporting the most vulnerable segments. In"
"","September 2022, a staff level agreement was reached for an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) from the IMF,"
"","followed  by  efforts  to  secure  financing  assurances  from  official  creditors  towards  the  restructuring  of  debt,"
"","in  line  with  the  debt  sustainability  targets  envisaged  under  the  IMF-EFF  supported  programme.  In  March"
"","2023, the Executive Board of the IMF approved the EFF supported programme of 48-months, amounting to"
"","approximately US dollars 3 billion, along with an economic adjustment programme that was aimed at putting"
"","Sri Lanka back on a recovery path, while addressing structural impediments that constrained the country’s"
"","growth  potential  over  the  past  decades.  With  a  multitude  of  goals  to  be  achieved  under  the  IMF-EFF"
"","arrangement, restoring public debt sustainability through the debt restructuring process will be one of the key"
"","milestones in the path towards attaining a sustained growth in the economy. However, debt restructuring could"
"","pose near term challenges in the financial sector that need to be addressed proactively by the Government"
"","and Central Bank, thereby reinforcing the financial system stability in the period ahead."
"","Policy measures and reforms implemented by the Government and the Central Bank have yielded notable"
"","success thus far. Inflation returned to an impressive disinflation path following a historic peak in September"
"","2022, and the exchange rate remained stable and registered an appreciation in early 2023, having depreciated"
"","sharply during the first half of 2022. Further, the external current account deficit remained modest alongside"
"","the gradual accumulation of official reserves, thereby enabling the reinstatement of exchange rate flexibility"
"","from early March 2023. The envisaged normalisation of foreign exchange flows and the completion of the debt"
"","restructuring process during 2023, and the sweeping reforms in the public sector, are expected to pave way"
"","for the country’s progress towards improved and sustainable economic prospects."
"","The  socio-economic  crisis  in  2022  underlined  many  lessons  that  the  country  failed  to  grasp,  despite"
"","the  recurrence  of  such  macroeconomic  failures  throughout  its  post-independence  history.  This  economic"
"","episode  reiterated  the  essentiality  of  data-driven  policymaking;  devastating  implications  of  ad  hoc  policy"
"","experiments; crippling welfare impacts of myopic populist policies; and the cost of policy delays, disregarding"
"","evidence-based policy analysis, well-established economic fundamentals and expert opinions. The general"
"","public and businesses at large had to bear the cost of a one-time adjustment of delayed structural reforms."
"","Against  this  backdrop,  the  Government,  the  Central  Bank,  and  all  other  stakeholders  need  to  extend  their"
"","support towards the implementation of essential reforms at this juncture, to resolve the structural hindrances"
"","that have rooted in the economy over the last seven and a half decades. Failing to execute such reforms would"
"","lead  to  perpetual  bailouts,  endless  cycles  of  external  borrowing  and  recurring  debt  restructuring  alongside"
"","unsustainable and highly volatile business cycles, which would cause undue pressure on citizenry, preventing"
"","the country from achieving longstanding economic progress and prosperity. Hence, in the country’s efforts"
"","to  emerge  from  the  current  crisis,  consistent  and  well-coordinated  policies,  including  those  outlined  in  the"
"","IMF-EFF supported programme, should be executed in a timely manner to avert another crisis in the period"
"","ahead."
