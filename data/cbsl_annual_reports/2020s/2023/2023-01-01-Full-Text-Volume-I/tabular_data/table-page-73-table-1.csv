Accountability
The  provisions  of  the  CBA  were  put  forward  with  the 
broader 
view  of 
strengthening 
accountability  of  the  Central  Bank  in  its  policy  and 
operational  decision  making.  The  CBA  has  explicit 
provisions 
ensuring 
administrative 
and 
financial 
autonomy,  which  would  emphasise  more  operational 
independence  in  policymaking  at  the  Central  Bank. 
Further, external influences on the Governor, appointed 
Members

and 
categorically prohibited under the CBA. 
In order to ensure autonomy in monetary policymaking, 
the CBA ensures no government representation in the 
Central  Bank’s  decision  making  bodies  in  any  form. 
However, 
the  Coordination  Council 
is  expected 
to 
facilitate 
information  sharing  and 
the  exchange  of 
views  on  events  posing  significant  risks  to  financial 
stability  or  economic  activity.  Meantime,  the  Central 
Bank will remain as the financial advisor, fiscal agent, 
to 
and  banker  to  the  Government.  However,  the  fiscal 
dominance  on  monetary  policymaking, 
the  major 
impediment on monetary policy in the past, has been 
avoided by restricting monetary financing of the fiscal 
deficit  and  a  check  on  provisional  advances  to  the 
Government,  which 
is  essential 
for 
the  success  of 
FIT.  Accordingly,  the  Central  Bank  is  restricted  from 
granting direct or indirect credits to the Government, 
to any government owned entity, or to any other public 
entity,  not  incur  costs  on  behalf  of  the  Government
