"","Pre-Implementation Information Security Testing"
"a)","Scope"
"","i) 
Critical  information  systems  and  information  systems  exposed  to"
"","customer  data  shall  be  subject  to  pre-implementation  information"
"","security  tests.  Any  other  information  system  that  could  potentially"
"","make  any  critical 
information  system  or  any 
information  system"
"","exposed to customer data vulnerable shall also be subjected to pre-"
"","implementation information security tests."
"","ii) 
The  Board  of  Directors  shall  decide  on  the  need  to  conduct  pre-"
"","implementation 
information 
security 
testing 
for 
non-critical"
"","information  systems  exposed  to  confidential  non-customer  data  on"
"","the recommendation of BIRMC and ISC."
"","iii) 
Pre-implementation  information  security  tests  shall  be  conducted"
"","prior 
to 
initial 
implementation  and  prior 
to 
implementation  of"
"","modifications.  Minor  modifications  could  be  excluded  from  pre-"
"","implementation  information  security  tests  based  on  an  exclusion"
"","policy approved by the Board of Directors. In the event of any specific"
"","minor  modification  needs  to  be  excluded,  the  approval  of  ISC  is"
"","required at the time of implementation."
"b)","Following 
types  of  pre-implementation 
tests  shall  be  carried  out  as"
"","applicable to the given implementation:"
"","i) 
Static Application Security Testing (SAST) or source code reviews to"
"","detect any malicious or unsafe code."
"","ii) 
Dynamic  Application  Security  Testing  (DAST)  to  detect  application-"
"","level vulnerabilities an attacker could exploit."
"","iii)  Quality assurance testing on computing and networking infrastructure"
"","hardening to ensure compliance with internal hardening policies, and"
"","iv) 
Infrastructure  vulnerability  assessments  to  identify  vulnerabilities  in"
"","computing and networking infrastructure."
