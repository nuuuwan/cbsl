Accordingly, the Bank launched refinance and credit schemes through LCBs and LSBs under the names Saubagya COVID-19 Renaissance Facility Phase I, II, III and Liquidity Facility to the Construction Sector at concessionary interest rates with maturity terms ranging from 6 months to 2 years with the condition of lending by LCBs and LSBs to businesses affected by the pandemic.

Accordingly GOSL agreed to transfer the funds from Post SCA\u20132 accounts to PRGF/HIPC Trust account, not as an outright grant, but as an interest free deposit until 2018.

In the first line of defence, operational departments are responsible for identifying, analysing, evaluating, treating, monitoring, reviewing and reporting financial and/or operational risks related to their functions, through their respective reporting channels, in line with the risk management structure of the CBSL. Risk Management Department, as a part of the second line of defence, is responsible for facilitating the risk management process related to financial and operational risks, by coordinating relevant activities to direct and guide CBSL in this regard. With regard to operational risks, RMD reports to the BROC, through the NFRMC and with regard to financial risks, RMD reports directly to the BROC, on a periodic basis. Internal Audit Department (IAD), as the third line of defence, is responsible for providing independent objective assurance and recommendations to add value and improving the control environment relating to operations of the CBSL through audits. IAD reports the progress of the conduct of audits to the MB and MBAAC, quarterly and submits information on audit reports issued to the Auditor General on quarterly basis.",

This portfolio is not an investment portfolio, as the Bank does not purchase Government Securities with the intention of earning an interest income. The Bank purchases or sells Government Securities to inject rupee liquidity into the domestic market or to absorb liquidity from the market in the course of carrying out its monetary policy operations in relation to one of its core objectives, maintaining economic and price stability. Hence, the volume of Government Securities in the Bank\u2019s portfolio is largely determined by its monetary policy operations. However, the portfolio may include Government Securities purchased under Section 112 of the Monetary Law Act. In addition, the basic interest rates in the rupee market, the Standing Deposit Rate and the Standing Lending Rate are policy rates determined by the Bank in the course of implementing its monetary policy. Moreover, the Bank's actions in injecting rupee liquidity or absorbing liquidity from the market have a significant impact on general rupee market interest rates. Thus, changes in the interest income earned from the Government Securities portfolio, which arise from changes in the volume of the Bank\u2019s Government Securities portfolio, as well as changes in interest rates, are primarily a consequence of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy actions or monetary financing, rather than due to investment decisions. Therefore, the Bank does not consider interest rate sensitivities arising from local currency assets",

CBSL has signed an agreement which enable CH to lend at their wish depending on the demand for those bonds. Since the lending does not involve CBSL and CH lends them directly to the borrowers, the process is called auto bond lending. At the end of each month, custodian will send fee income for auto bond lending, if any for the bonds which they lent under auto bond lending programme.

CMD was also instrumental in providing live coverage for its press conferences and other important events to the desktops of the staff to ensure they were well informed about the happenings at the Central Bank. An online Knowledge Sharing Platform was introduced in 2022 to break silos in the work environment and to share information pertaining to the policies and processes of respective departments among the staff, whereby 8 timely topics were discussed through the MS Teams platform. To ensure that all staff is well versed on developments in the local economy as well as the global financial markets, CMD shared all relevant online news among the staff via email, supplemented by the Library and Information Center (LIC) of CMD, which identifies all relevant newspaper articles, which are uploaded to the intranet platform. All critical news items are also brought to the attention of the Senior Management. Considering the increasing price of newsprint, LIC embarked on an electronic newspaper drive, to reduce costs. LIC also disseminated information by way of e-books, specific chapters of books, scholarly articles, etc. among the staff on a regular basis. In addition to that, LIC relaunched the book review competition for staff in October 2022, in celebration of National Reading Month, and 2 winners were selected.

As the Secretariat to the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), ERD facilitated eight scheduled MPC meetings. Enabling the MPC to make informed policy recommendations to the Monetary Board on the appropriate monetary policy stance of the Central Bank, comprehensive reports were presented on developments in the economy, monetary conditions, external sector issues, and model based macroeconomic projections, such as inflation and growth forecasts. Further, ERD provided analyses and reports to the Senior Management of the Central Bank on various economic issues, highlighting appropriate policy measures required to ensure macroeconomic stability. Meanwhile, the Stakeholder Engagement Committee (SEC) was established in July 2022 by replacing the Monetary Policy Consultative Committee (MPCC) and the Financial System Stability Consultative Committee (FSSCC) of the Central Bank, which were in operation previously. The Committee consists of a cross section of stakeholders, including eminent professionals, academics, and private sector personnel. SEC generally meets on a quarterly basis and the meetings are facilitated by ERD along with secretarial assistance. ERD continued to improve inhouse modelling and forecasting capacity with technical assistance received from the IMF, as a part of continuous efforts in extending the analytical capacity that contributes to monetary policy decision making and communication.

The main objective of the EPMS is to ensure all exports of goods from the country are captured into a database and to monitor the repatriation of export proceeds as per the Rules on Repatriation of Export Proceeds into Sri Lanka. The EPMS captures export information through a web service provided by SLC and export proceeds repatriation details are submitted by ADs to the system.

However, subsequent to the Central Bank\u2019s decision to allow a measured adjustment in the exchange rate on 07 March 2022 due to the sharp depletion of gross official reserves of the country and the significant pressures in the domestic FX market, the USD/LKR exchange rate started to overshoot. As a measure in managing the intraday volatility of the exchange rate, amidst the challenging liquidity position and the absence of an active interbank FX market, the Central Bank commenced announcing exchange rate guidance with a variation margin since 13 May 2022. Consequently, the exchange rate stabilised gradually, and the weighted average spot exchange rate in the interbank FX market hovered between Rs. 360 - Rs. 363 per US dollar during the period from mid May to end December 2022. Since mid May 2022, IOD commenced publishing the USD/LKR middle spot exchange rate with a prescribed variation margin along with middle exchange rates for 56 other world currencies, on the Central Bank website, on a daily basis.

This requires buildup of legal, regulatory, and institutional architecture, in order to respond in a timely and effective way. As such, the World Bank highlighted the importance of the formation of a Financial Sector CMC as a forum for policy coordination. Accordingly, MSD took the initiative to develop the framework for the establishment of CMC, which will be a permanent forum to work during crisis times for effective financial crisis management and during non-crisis times to strengthen the financial crisis preparedness framework in the country.",
