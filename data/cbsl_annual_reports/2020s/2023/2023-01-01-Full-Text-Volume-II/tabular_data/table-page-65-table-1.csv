48.2 Interest Rate Risk 
(a)  
Foreign Currency Interest Rate Sensitivity
Interest rate risk is the risk of loss arising from the 
changes in interest rates.
The  interest  rate  sensitivity  of  the  Fixed  Income  Securities 
portfolio  is  measured  by  the  potential  gain  or  loss  that 
could  incur  due  to  a  change  in  interest  rate  by  10  basis 
RMD manages the interest rate risk of the foreign assets 
portfolio by employing the following strategies:
i)    While the interest rate sensitivity measures the effect of a 
change in interest rates on the foreign assets portfolio, the 
Bank uses Modified Duration (MD) as a measurement of 
interest rate risk which considers interest rates as well as the 
duration of an investment. The MD measures the change 
in price of a security for a 1% change in the interest rates 
(yield).  A  higher  MD  indicates  a  higher  risk.  Hence,  the 
Bank sets an appropriate MD from time to time considering 
the  developments 
characteristics and the risk appetite of the bond portfolio. 
The MDs of the foreign assets portfolio are tabulated below:
ii)  Since  the  MD  does  not  account  for  large  changes  in 
prices, another measure used for management of interest 
rate  risk  of  the  foreign  reserves  portfolio  is  convexity. 
Convexity measures the extent of deviation in bond price-
yield curve from a straight line representing duration. It 
allows  improving  the  duration  approximation  for  bond 
price  changes.  Convexity  is  a  change  in  duration  for","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
