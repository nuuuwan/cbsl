Interest Accrual
The  Asian  Clearing  Union  (ACU)  was  established  in  1974 
at  the  initiative  of  the  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social 
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). The ACU was 
established  as  a  mechanism  to  settle,  on  a  multilateral  net 
basis,  the  payments  for  intra-regional  transactions,  among 
Central  Banks  of  participant  countries.  The  participants  of 
the  ACU  are  Sri  Lanka,  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  Iran, 
Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan. The net settlement 
position  of  each  ACU  participant  is  calculated  based  on 
the daily outstanding balance held over the applicable two-
month period and settlement takes place within four working 
Total Interest bearing Loans
days  of  the  following  month.  The  applicable  interest  rate

comparison to a range of 0.09% to 0.15% in 2021.
