Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2022Part II - 4

The Central Bank was established as the authority responsible for the administration, supervision and regulation of the monetary, financial and payment systems of Sri Lanka under the Monetary Law Act. In accordance with this Act, the Bank is charged with the responsibility of securing the core objectives of economic and price stability and financial system stability.

The basis of accountability for the Central Bank and the success of its operations therefore would be the effectiveness of its policies and operations leading towards the achievement of its core objectives and not necessarily its profitability. These statutory objectives are the fundamental features that distinguish the Central Bank from any other entity, private or public. Accordingly, profitability related approach, if adopted by the Central Bank, could result in the Bank pursuing profits while compromising its core objectives, since it has the unique ability to create its own profits through its monetary policy activities, which could influence interest rates and exchange rates. It therefore

Central Bank of Sri LankaManagement StatementFor the period ended 31 December 2022

Accountability and the Financial Performance of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in relation to the Objectives

follows that the Central Bank’s objectives of economic and price stability and financial system stability need to be distinguished and detached from the pure profitability objective which should essentially be incidental or academic only.

In this background, the Central Bank’s financial statements record gains and/or deficits in the implementation of its monetary policy operations, exchange rate management, issuing of currency, etc. at the values as realized and hence, the financial performance as reported in these statements needs to be interpreted and understood in that context.

The Bank is subject to an external audit by the Auditor General under the Monetary Law Act sections 42 & 43. The Auditor General in turn has obtained the services of a firm of Chartered Accountants, M/s Ernst & Young, to carry out an audit under International Standards of Auditing to ensure compliance with the International Financial Reporting Standards.

1. REPORTING ENTITY AND STATUTORY BASE

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (“Bank” or “CBSL”) is an institution established under the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949 of Sri Lanka as amended (“MLA”), as the authority responsible for the administration, supervision and regulation of monetary, financial and payment system of Sri Lanka. The Bank is domiciled in the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and situated at No: 30, Janadhipathi Mawatha, Colombo 01.

These financial statements were authorized for issue by the Governor and Chief Accountant for and on behalf of the Monetary Board on 31 March 2023.

1.1 Principal Activities

The Monetary Board of the CBSL is, in addition to determining the policies or measures authorized to be adopted or taken under Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949 of Sri Lanka as amended, vested with the powers, duties and functions of the CBSL and are generally responsible for the management, operations and administration of the Bank. The Bank is primarily responsible for the administration, supervision, regulation of monetary, financial and payment system of Sri Lanka and also acts as the fiscal agent of the Government. The activities of the Bank mainly include:

• Implementing monetary and exchange rate

polices. • Issuing of currency. • Management of the official international reserves • Oversight of the financial system • Licensing, regulating and supervising of Banks

and selected Non-Bank Financial Institutions • Provision of settlement facilities and the

regulation of the payment system. • Compilation, dissemination and analysis of

economic data and statistics. • Providing loans and advances to the Government,

bank and financial institutions under various facilities. • Banker to the government and its agencies, and

provision of current account facilities to LCBs and non-commercial bank primary dealers for government securities. The activities carried out in order to achieve its objective of economic, price and financial system stability with a view to encouraging and promoting the development of the productive resources of Sri Lanka can be broadly segregated into foreign currency and local currency

activities. Results of these activities are taken to Operating Activities in the context of the Statement of Income.

2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2.1 Statement of Compliance

These financial statements of the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2022 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

2.2 Basis of Measurement

The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the following,

• Gold is measured at fair value through profit or

loss (FVTPL). • Derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) are measured at fair value. • Land and buildings are measured at cost at the

time of acquisition and subsequently at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. • Liability for defined benefit obligations is

measured as the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the plan assets.

2.3 Reporting Format

The Bank presents financial assets and financial liabilities, and their associated income and expense streams, by distinguishing between foreign currency and local currency operations. In the Statement of Financial Position, assets and liabilities are presented broadly in order of liquidity within such distinguished categories. The Bank considers that this reporting approach provides appropriate reporting of the Bank's activities which are more fully described in Note 7.

2.4 Functional and Presentation Currency

The Financial Statements are presented in Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR), which is the Bank’s functional currency. Financial information presented in Sri Lankan Rupees has been rounded to the nearest thousand. There was no change in the Bank’s presentation and functional currency during the year under review.

2.5 Materiality and Aggregation

Each material class of similar item is presented separately in the Financial Statements. Items of dissimilar nature or function are presented separately unless they are immaterial.

Central Bank of Sri LankaNotes to the Financial Statements

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2022Part II - 14

2.6 Offsetting

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in Statement of Financial Position when, and only when, the Bank has a legal right to set off the recognized amounts and it intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

2.7 Comparative Information

The comparative information is reclassified whenever necessary to conform with the current year’s presentation.

3. USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

The preparation of the Bank’s financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities.

Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively. Information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognized in the Financial Statements are described in the following notes.

3.1 Classification and Impairment of Financial Assets

The Bank used judgements when assessing of the business model within which the assets are held and whether the contractual terms of the financial assets are solely-payment-of-principal-and-interest (SPPI) on the principal amount of the outstanding. The Bank also used judgements when establishing the criteria for determining whether credit risk on the financial assets has increased significantly since initial recognition, determining methodology for incorporating forward looking information into measurement of Expected Credit Losses (ECL) and selection and approval of models to measure ECL.

3.2 Pensions and Other Post Employment Benefit Plans

The cost of defined benefit plans is determined using an actuarial valuation. The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about discount rates, future compensation increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. Assumptions used in the actuarial valuation are disclosed in Note 32 to the Financial Statements.

3.3 Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Where the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the Statement of Financial Position cannot be derived from active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. The inputs to these models are derived from observable market data where possible, but if this is not available, judgment is required to establish fair values. The judgments include considerations of liquidity and model inputs such as volatility for longer–dated derivatives.

3.4 General Implications of Adverse Economic Conditions and COVID-19

The Bank considered the impact of the adverse economic environment and COVID-19 in preparing the financial statements. While the specific areas of judgement have not changed, the impact of adverse economic conditions and COVID-19 resulted in application of additional judgement and estimates mainly in relation to loans to banks and the expected credit loss assessment in the financial statements.

CBSL implemented a range of relief and policy measures to revive the economy which was affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Among those, the most significant relief measure which had financial implication on the Bank’s financial statements were the loan schemes implemented to support the revival of the economy. Accordingly, the Bank launched refinance and credit schemes through LCBs and LSBs under the names Saubagya COVID-19 Renaissance Facility Phase I, II, III and Liquidity Facility to the Construction Sector at concessionary interest rates with maturity terms ranging from 6 months to 2 years with the condition of lending by LCBs and LSBs to businesses affected by the pandemic. Most of these facilities were outstanding as of the end of 31.12.2022 due to the extension of the moratoriums given resulting from the adverse economic circumstances prevailed in year 2022. The fair value is determined by using valuation techniques that involve use of unobservable inputs and judgment, particularly with respect to ensuring that the valuation techniques and inputs are relevant and appropriate. As such, critical judgments were used in the determination of the repayment terms and the market interest rate used in arriving at the initial recognition of fair value of the said loan schemes.

Though the fundamental credit loss model mechanics and methodology underpinning the Bank’s calculation of expected credit losses have remained consistent with prior periods, the Bank has captured the impact of the adverse economic circumstances of year 2022 and COVID-19 through the expected credit loss model inputs, assumptions and forward-looking macroeconomic variables used in the computation process. In addition, the Bank used calibrations in the forward looking macro-economic data used in the expected credit loss model to avoid unprecedented statistical variations caused by the

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2022Part II - 15

movements in the macro- economic data resulting from both the adverse economy and COVID-19.

However, for non-financial assets, the Bank’s assessment is that both the adverse economic situation and COVID-19 related conditions had no impact on the carrying values and was appropriately assessed in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.

4. CHANGES TO SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

There were no changes to the accounting policies and accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.

5. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

5.1 Foreign Currency Translations and Balances

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to Sri Lankan Rupees at the rate of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated to Sri Lankan Rupees at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date. The foreign currency translation gain or loss on monetary items are taken to the Statement of Income. For the purposes of retranslation, as at the reporting date, the following Sri Lankan Rupee exchange rates for major currencies were used:

Currency2022Rs.2021Rs. 1 Australian Dollar247.0237145.58511 Canadian Dollar268.4335158.61501 Euro388.3461227.88321 Japanese Yen2.77031.74171 Special Drawing Rights (SDR)483.3276280.93121 Sterling Pound437.4023271.22701 United States Dollar363.1100200.43381 Chinese Yuan (Offshore)52.651331.5294

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

5.2 Fair Value Measurement

The Bank measures financial instruments, such as, foreign securities, derivatives, and non-financial assets such as gold, at fair value at each reporting date. The fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in Note 50.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

• In the principal market for the asset or liability, or

• In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability

The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Bank.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The Bank uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.

Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Bank determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

5.3 Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

The Bank presents financial assets and liabilities, and the associated income and expense streams, by distinguishing between foreign currency and local currency activities.

Foreign currency activities mainly arise from the Bank’s foreign reserves management function. Local currency activities mainly reflect the assets and liabilities

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2022Part II - 16

associated with monetary policy implementation, issuing currency and banking activities.

The separate reporting of these activities is considered to provide a better presentation of the Bank’s financial position, financial performance and risk profile. The Bank considers that the combined reporting of foreign and local currency activities would weaken the informational value of the financial statements.

5.3.1 Recognition and Initial Measurement

All financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and including acquisition charges associated with the investment. All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the trade date respectively. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the market place.

5.3.2 Classification

Financial Assets

On initial recognition, Bank classifies the financial assets as measured at;

• Amortized Cost

• Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income

(FVOCI)

• Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)

A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL

• The asset is held within a business model whose

objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and

• The contractual terms of the financial asset give

rise on specified dates to cashflows that are Solely Payment of Principle and Interest.

A financial asset is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL.

• The asset is held within a business model whose

objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and

• The contractual terms of the financial asset give

rise on specified dates to cashflows that are Solely Payment of Principle and Interest.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. All other financial assets are classified as measured at FVTPL.

Business Model Assessment

The Bank makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The information considered includes but not limited to:

• How the performance of the business model and

the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the entity’s key management personnel.

• The risks that affect the performance of the

business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed.

• The frequency, volume and timing of sales in

prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realized.

Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

Assessment of whether Contractual Cash Flows are Solely Payments of Principal and Interest

The Bank assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. For the purpose of this assessment, “Principal” is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and “Interest” is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs.

The most significant elements of interest within a lending arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Bank applies judgement and considers relevant factors such as the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interest rate is set.

In contrast, contractual terms that introduce a more than the minimum exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that are unrelated to a basic lending arrangement do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the amount outstanding. In such cases, the financial asset is required to be measured at FVTPL.

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2022Part II - 17

Reclassifications

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the Bank changes its business model for managing financial assets.

5.3.3 Derecognition

Financial Assets

Bank derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised) and the sum of (i) the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI is recognised in profit or loss.

Any cumulative gain/loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated as at FVOCI is not recognised in profit or loss on derecognition of such securities. Any interest in transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Bank is recognised as a separate asset or liability.

The Bank enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognized on its statement of financial position but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets or a portion of them. In such cases, the transferred assets are not derecognized. Examples of such transactions are securities lending and sale-and-repurchase transactions. In transactions in which the Bank neither retains nor transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset and it retains control over the asset, the Bank continues to recognize the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset.

Financial Liabilities

The Bank derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired.

5.3.4 Impairment of Financial Assets

The Bank recognizes loss allowances for ECL on the following financial instruments that are not measured at FVTPL:

• Financial assets at Fair Value through Other

Comprehensive Income

• Financial Assets at Amortized Cost

• Credit guarantee contracts of Regional Development

Department

No impairment loss is recognized on equity investments.

The Bank measures loss allowances at an amount equal to 12 months ECL for investments which are in investment grade (rated Baa3/BBB- and above). Majority of the investments of the Bank which are classified as Fair value through other comprehensive income and Amortized cost are above Baa3/BBB- rate. Financial instruments for which a 12-month ECL is recognised are referred to as “Stage 1 financial instruments”.

Life time ECL is calculated for those instruments which are below the investment grade at initial recognition or whose credit risk deteriorates below Baa3/BBB- or when a doubling of the probability of default has occurred after initial recognition. Financial instruments for which a lifetime ECL is recognised but which are not credit-impaired are referred to as “Stage 2 financial instruments”. Life time ECL would also be computed for credit impaired assets which would be referred to as “Stage 3 financial instruments”.

Measurement of ECL

The mechanism of the ECL calculations are outlined below with the key elements.

Probability of Default (PD): The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognized and is still in the portfolio. The Bank uses specific equity PD’s of issuers/counterparties from Bloomberg for all its foreign investments at FVOCI and amortized cost and in the absence of equity PDs, the PD’s applicable to the rating of the specific issuer/counterparty from the Bloomberg common PD table at a given reporting date.

Exposure at Default: The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected draw downs on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments.

Loss Given Default (LGD): The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. The Bank has an approved internal policy in applying the LGD for different types

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2022Part II - 18

of Financial Assets based on their risk exposure to the Bank.

Economic Factor Adjustment: Bank uses the Economic Factor Adjustment for the conversion of through the cycle PD to point in time PD and the Bank mainly uses GDP, Inflation and Interest rate data as the main economic factors in stimulating the PD.

Assessing the Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR)

Bank will consider that the financial instruments have Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) when doubling of PD has occurred from initial recognition and any rating downgrade below BBB- after initial recognition. This is based on the observation that all ratings downgrades from an investment grade rating to a non-investment grade rating, including the marginal one notch downgrade from Baa3 to Ba1, results in a two-fold or greater increase of PD.

Credit-impaired financial assets

At each reporting date, the Bank assesses whether financial assets carried at amortized cost, at FVOCI, and credit guarantees are credit-impaired (referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial assets’). A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

• significant financial difficulty of the borrower or

issuer;

• a breach of contract such as a default or past due

event;

• it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter

bankruptcy or other financial reorganization.

Presentation of allowance for ECL in the Statement of Financial Position

Loss allowances for ECL are presented in the Statement of Financial Position as follows:

• Financial assets measured at amortised cost: as a

deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets;

• Investments measured at FVOCI: no loss allowance

is recognised in the Statement of Financial Position because the carrying amount of these assets is their fair value. However, the loss allowance is disclosed and is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income.

• Credit guarantee contracts: generally, as a provision.

Write-off

Loans and debt securities are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion

thereof. This is generally the case when the Bank determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment is carried out at the individual asset level. Recoveries of amounts previously written off are included in ‘impairment losses on financial instruments’ in the Statement of Income and OCI.

5.4 Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss

Financial assets classified as held for trading are included in the category “securities at fair value through profit or loss”. Upon initial recognition, attributable transaction cost are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. These securities are subsequently valued at quoted market prices. Changes in market values are recognised as an increase or decrease in the value of the securities in the Statement of Financial Position while resulting gains and losses are recognised in the Statement of Income.

Where the security is still owned, the gain or loss is reported as “Gain/(Loss) from Unrealised Price Revaluations”. Where the gain or loss has been realised (through selling the security), it is reported as “Gain / (Loss) from Realised Price Revaluations”.

5.5 Financial Assets at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income

Investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income are non-derivative investments that are designated as Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income or are not classified as another category of financial assets. Investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income comprise of equity securities and debt securities.

Foreign Currency debt securities at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income are subsequently valued at quoted market prices. Changes in market value are recognized as an increase or decrease in the value of the Investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income in the Statement of Financial Position.

The equity investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income are subsequently valued based on the Net Assets of the respective institutions due to the non-availability of quoted prices.

Gains and losses arising from changes in the market value of Foreign and Local Currency debt securities and Equity Investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income are recognised directly in equity (Other Comprehensive Income) which is shown under Other Reserves in the Statement of Financial Position until the investment is sold, collected or otherwise disposed of, or until the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported as equity is included in Statement of

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2022Part II - 19

Income with the exception of fair value changes in equity investments which will not be recycled to Statement of Income upon derecognition. Interest income is recognised in Statement of Income using the effective interest method.

5.6 Instruments held at Amortized Cost

The items that are held within the business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cashflows and the contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specific dates that are solely principle and interest are classified as instruments held at amortized cost. These instruments are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

5.7 Derivative Instruments

The Bank uses derivatives such as cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts for risk management purposes and not for speculative purposes. Derivatives are recorded at fair value and carried as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are included in ‘Gain / (Loss) from Unrealized Price Revaluations’.

When the transaction price differs from the fair value of other observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets, the Bank immediately recognises the difference between the transaction price and fair value (a Day 1 difference) in ‘Gain / (Loss) from Unrealized Price Revaluations’. In cases where fair value is determined using data which is not observable, the difference between the transaction price and model value is only recognised in the Statement of Income when inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised.

5.8 International Monetary Fund (IMF) Related Balances

The Bank transacts with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its own right rather than as the depository of the Government of Sri Lanka. All transactions by the Bank with the IMF have been included in these financial statements on that basis.

The bank records the quota with the IMF as an asset and the amount payable to the IMF for quota is recorded as a liability of the Bank. The cumulative allocation of SDRs by the IMF is treated as a liability. The IMF quota asset and the SDR holding is classified as FVTPL while other IMF related assets and liabilities are recognized at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Exchange gains and losses arising on revaluation of IMF assets and liabilities at the exchange rate applying at reporting date as published by the IMF are recognised in the Statement of Income.

All other charges and interest pertaining to balances with the IMF are recorded immediately in the Statement of Income.

5.9 Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at foreign banks and financial institutions, short-term deposits and highly liquid financial assets with original maturities of less than three months, which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in their fair value and are used by the Bank in the management of its short-term commitments and cash equivalents are carried at amortized cost in the Statement of Financial Position.

As a part of local currency activities CBSL generates certain income and incurs expenses, which do not involve in movement of cash. Those activities result in certain assets and liabilities and mainly comprise of the transactions with the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) and transactions with domestic banks and financial institutions. Transactions with GOSL include the purchase of Treasury bills and bonds that are issued by the Government as a monetary policy mechanism. Such purchases, disposals or interest thereon are reflected as mere book entries in the records of CBSL. These are disclosed separately in Note 45 and Note 46 to the Financial Statements.

As the sole statutory authority, CBSL issues currency to the public in line with Monetary Law Act. Currency issued by CBSL represents a claim on the Bank in favor of the holder. This is a liability on the part of the CBSL while it is an item of cash in the hands of the holder.

Movement in circulation currency is included as part of financing activities in line with prevailing industry practices among those central banks which present cash flow statements.

CBSL through the cash/pay order process disburses cash in the form of notes and coins or cheques drawn on CBSL, to various drawees including suppliers and employees for goods and services obtained, which is either added to the currency in circulation liability or deposits by banks and financial institutions. Such forms of utilization of currency for the purposes of CBSL’s payments form part of cash outflows of CBSL.

For the purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of cash/ pay order outflows.

5.10 Repurchase and Reverse-Repurchase Transactions

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase continue to be recorded as assets in the Statement of Financial Position. The obligation to repurchase (Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase) is recognised as a liability. The difference between the sale and repurchase price in repurchase transactions and the purchase

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2022Part II - 20

price and sale price in reverse-repurchase transactions represents an expense and income respectively and recognised in the Statement of Income.

Securities held under reverse-repurchase agreements are recorded as an asset in the Statement of Financial Position (Securities Purchased under Resale Agreements). Both repurchase and reverse-repurchase transactions are reported at amortized cost inclusive of any accrued income or expense.

5.11 Standing Deposit and Lending Facilities

With effect from 1 February 2014, Standing Deposit Facility (former Standing Repurchase (Repo) Facility) was converted in to a ‘clean deposit’ with no allocation of collateral. Hence, participating institutions invest their excess funds in the Standing Deposit Facility as a clean deposit on daily basis at standing deposit facility rate.

The procedures of Standing Lending Facility (Formerly Standing Reverse Repurchase (Reverse Repo) Facility) are identical to the Standing Reverse Repurchase Facility and both are recognized at amortized cost in the Statement of Financial Position.

5.12 CBSL Securities

The Bank issues CBSL Securities from time to time under its Monetary Policy operations to absorb excess liquidity in the market. The securities issued are recorded as a liability.

5.13 Sri Lanka Government Securities

Sri Lanka Government Securities consists of Treasury Bills and Bonds purchased from GOSL. Investments in Sri Lanka Government Securities is recorded in the Statement of Financial Position at Fair value through Other Comprehensive Income.

5.14 Provisional Advances to Government

Advances to Government represents direct provisional advances made to GOSL under Section 89 of the Monetary Law Act No.58 of 1949 of Sri Lanka, as amended. These advances are subsequently measured at amortized cost.

5.15 Loans to Other Institutions

Loans granted to Other Institutions are recognized and carried at amortized cost.

5.16 Securities Borrowings and Securities Lending

Bank borrows Government Securities from time to time under its monetary policy operations from major institutional investors. The borrowed securities are used by the Bank for repurchase operations to absorb excess liquidity in the market.

The securities borrowings is an unconditional blanket guarantee from the Bank for return of securities, payment of agreed fee and on compensation at market rate (as per the market rates communicated to the primary market participants by the Public Debt Department of the Bank) in the events of any failure in delivery.

The market values of the securities borrowed and not used for the repurchase operations at a particular time are recorded as a contingent liability. The commission paid is expensed on accrual basis.

Transfer of securities to counterparties under lending transactions is only reflected on the Statement of Financial Position if the risks and rewards of ownership are also transferred.

5.17 Staff Loans

Bank employees are entitled to loan facilities under concessionary interest rates. These loans which were granted from 2008 onwards are fair valued as per IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” using discounted cash flows.

Discount rate - Average Weighted Prime Lending Rate (AWPR) is used as the discount rate and it varies with the period of the loans.

The difference between the present value of the staff loan as at the end of a year and beginning of the year have been amortized yearly to record the expense incurred by the Bank in providing these loans at concessionary rates and equivalent amount is recorded as other income to record the income that would have been earned by the Bank if these loans were granted at market rates.

Assumptions used for computation of fair valuation

• The date of staff loan granted is considered as 1

January.• There were no amendments or early settlements.

5.18 Gold

Section 67 (1) of the Monetary Law Act which specifies the composition of the International Reserve indicates that gold may be held by the CBSL as part of this Reserve. According to Section 67(2), Monetary Board is required to endeavor to hold at least a nuclear reserve in gold or currencies freely convertible by the Central Bank, whether directly or indirectly, in to gold as per the MLA. As this gold is part of the International Reserve and not used as a commodity which is traded during the normal course of business, gold is fair valued and the gains or losses are transferred to the Statement of Income. Prior to appropriation of profits, the unrealised gains from gold are transferred to the relevant reserve account.

5.19 Currency Inventory

Inventories of the Bank include new currencies that are not yet issued to the circulation. Cost related to production

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2022Part II - 21

and design of new currency notes and coins are initially recognized at cost. Cost of new currency notes and coins which are issued to the circulation is determined on a weighted average basis and at the time of issue it is charged to Statement of Income. Allowance is made for slow moving inventories.

5.20 Other Inventories

Other inventories are carried at lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis.

5.21 Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, Plant and Equipment excluding land and buildings are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment in value. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of such Property, Plant and Equipment when that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met.

Land and buildings are measured at revalued amount, being their fair value at the date of revaluation, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

Except for the freehold land, depreciation is calculated on a straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives.

Class of AssetUseful Life

Buildings on Freehold LandsOver 50 Years

Buildings on Leasehold LandLower of 50 Years or over the lease term

Plant & Plant Integrals 20 Years Furniture & Equipment10 Years Motor Vehicles5 Years Motor Vehicles acquired 2014 onwards10 YearsComputer Hardware 4 Years Others3 Years

The carrying values of Property, Plant and Equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

Policy for revaluation of land and buildings of the Bank is at least once in three years or at any shorter interval when a significant valuation adjustment becomes evident. Any revaluation surplus is credited to the Revaluation Reserve included in the equity section of the Statement of Financial Position, except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognized in Statement of Income, in which case the increase is recognized in Statement of Income. A revaluation deficit is recognized in Statement of Income, except that a deficit directly offsetting a previous surplus on the same asset is directly offset against the surplus in the Revaluation Reserve. Upon disposal, any revaluation surplus relating to the particular asset being sold

is transferred to retained earnings.

An item of Property, Plant and Equipment is de-recognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the Statement of Income in the year the asset is de-recognized. The asset’s residual values, useful lives and methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, regularly.

Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost. These are expenses of a capital nature directly incurred in the construction of buildings, major plant and machinery and system development, awaiting capitalization.

5.22 Leases

At inception of a contract, the Bank assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange of consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Bank uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16.

Bank acting as a lessee

The Bank recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjustment for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove any improvements made to the lands or office premises.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain re-measurements of the lease liability.

The liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicated in the lease or if that rate cannot be determined, the Bank’s incremental borrowing rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:

• Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;

• Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a

rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;

• Amounts expected to be payable under a residual value

guarantee; and

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2022Part II - 22

• Exercise price under a purchase option that the Bank

is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Bank is reasonably certain not to terminate early.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Bank’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Bank changes its assessment of whether it will exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in Statement of Income if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

The Bank presents right-of-use assets in “Property, Plant and Equipment” (Note 20) and lease liabilities in “Miscellaneous Liabilities and Accruals” (Note 33) in the Statement of Financial Position.

5.23 Intangible Assets

Computer software not integral to computer hardware are shown as intangible assets and recognized at cost. Following initial recognition these intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment. Subsequent expenditure on software assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.

Amortisation is recognised in Statement of Income on a straight-line basis over the useful life of 4 years, from the date that it is available for use since this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.

5.24 Other Assets

Other assets are carried at expected realisable values.

5.25 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets

The Bank assesses at each end of reporting period if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired, whether there is an indication that a non-financial asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the bank makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in Statement of Income.

At each reporting date, the Bank reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to determine whether

there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.

For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that is largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets.

The ‘recoverable amount’ of an asset is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. ‘Value in use’ is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.

Impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

5.26 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Bank expects a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.

5.27 Currency in Circulation

Currency issued by the Bank represents a claim on the Bank in favour of the holder. The liability for Currency in Circulation is recorded at face value in the Statement of Financial Position.

5.28 Defined Benefit Plans

A defined benefit plan is a postemployment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. Bank operates defined benefit schemes for Pension, Widows’ and Orphans’ Pensions (W&OP), Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pensions (WR&OP), Retirement Gratuity and Post Employment Medical Benefits. The Bank and eligible beneficiaries make contributions, to separately administered funds in respect of the first three schemes.

The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. The Bank’s obligation in respect of defined benefit plan is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Any unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the valuation date on Government Bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the average remaining

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2022Part II - 23

years of service. All principal actuarial assumptions disclosed in Note 32 are revised annually.

5.29 Defined Contribution Plans

Employees are eligible for Employees’ Provident Fund Contributions and Employees’ Trust Fund Contributions in line with respective statutes and regulations. The Bank contributes 24% and 3% of employees’ gross emoluments to Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund respectively which are separately administered defined contribution plans.

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as expense in the Statement of Income as and when they are due.

5.30 Grants

Grants recognised at their fair value (where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions, if any, will be complied with) are shown under equity. When the grant relates to an expense item it is recognised in the Statement of Income over the periods necessary to match them to the expenses it is intended to compensate on a systematic basis. Where the grant relates to an asset, the fair value is credited to a deferred government grant account and is released to the Statement of Income over the expected useful life of the relevant asset on a systematic basis consistent with the depreciation policy of the related asset.

5.31 Contingent Liabilities and Commitments

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events or present obligations where the transfer of economic benefit is not probable or cannot be reliably measured. All guarantees of indebtedness, forward foreign exchange transactions and other commitments, which are not recognized in Statement of Financial Position, are shown under respective headings disclosed as Contingent Liabilities and Capital Commitments items. Where applicable, such amounts are measured at best estimates.

STATEMENT OF PROFIT OR LOSS AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

5.32 Revenue and Expenses

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Bank and the revenue can be reliably measured. Expenses are recognised in the Statement of Income on the basis of a direct association between the cost incurred and the earning of specific items of income. All expenditure incurred in the running of the business and in maintaining the property, plant & equipment in a state of efficiency has been charged to income in arriving at the result for the year.

The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue and expenses are recognised:

5.32.1 Interest Income and Expenses

Interest income and expense are recognised in the Statement of Income for all interest bearing instruments on an accrual basis using the effective yield method based on the actual purchase price unless collectability is in doubt. Interest income includes coupons earned on fixed income investments and securities and accrued discount and premium on treasury bills and other discounted instruments. Interest income is suspended when loans become doubtful of collection. Such income is excluded from interest income until received.

5.32.2 Dividends

Dividend income is recognized when the Bank’s right to receive the payment is established.

5.32.3 Miscellaneous Income and Expenses

Miscellaneous income and expenses are recognised on an accrual basis.

Net gains and losses of a revenue nature on the disposal of Property, Plant & Equipment have been accounted for in the Statement of Income, having deducted from proceeds on disposal, the carrying amount of the assets and related selling expenses.

Gains and losses arising from incidental activities to the main revenue generating activities and those arising from a group of similar transactions which are not material, are aggregated, reported and presented on a net basis.

5.32.4 Personnel Expenses

Personnel expenses include the full cost of all staff benefits. Salaries and related expenses due at year-end are included in other local payables.

5.32.5 Income Tax Expense

The income of the Bank is exempted from tax under section 118 of the Monetary Law Act 58 of 1949 as amended and as per section 9 (1) of Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017 and subsequent amendment as per Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 10 of 2021 and as per Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 45 of 2022. In terms of the Economic Service Charge (amendment)Act No. 07 of 2017, the Bank is liable for ESC commencing from 1 April 2017. However, unrealized gain on exchange rate and unrealized marked to market gain on foreign currency financial assets are exempted from ESC with effect from October 2018 as per the ESC (amendment) Act, No 33 of 2018. Further, the Bank is exempted from Value Added Tax on supply of financial services as per Value Added Tax (Amendment) Act No.17 of 2013.

ESC was abolished with effect from 1 January 2020.

5.33 Events Occurring after the Reporting Date

All material subsequent events after the reporting date have been considered and where appropriate adjustments or disclosures have been made in the respective notes to the Financial Statements.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

The cash flow statement has been prepared by using the “Direct Method” of preparing of cash flow statement in accordance with the IAS 7 - Statement of Cash Flow.

For the purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of cash/pay order outflows.

6. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE AS AT REPORTING DATE

A number of new standards and amendments to standards are effective for annual periods beginning after 1st January 2022 and earlier application is permitted; however, the Bank has not early adopted the new and amended standards in preparing these financial statements. Further, the Bank does not expect that these standard amendments and interpretations will have a material impact on the Bank’s financial statements.

6.1 Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2)

The key amendments to IAS 1 include:

• Replaces the requirements for entities to disclose their

“significant” accounting policies with a requirement to disclose “material” accounting policies.

• Provides guidance on how entities apply the concept of

materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures.

• Specify the requirements for classifying liabilities as

current or non-current

The amendments are effective for periods beginning on or after 1st January 2023.

6.2 Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8)

The amendments introduce a new definition for accounting estimates: clarifying that they are monetary amounts in the financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty.

The amendments also clarify the relationship between accounting policies and accounting estimates by specifying that the Bank develops an accounting estimate to achieve the objective set out by an accounting policy.

Developing an accounting estimate includes both:

• selecting a measurement technique (estimation or

valuation technique) – e.g. an estimation technique used to measure a loss allowance for expected credit losses when applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments; and• choosing the inputs to be used when applying the

chosen measurement technique – e.g. the expected

cash outflows for determining a provision for warranty obligations when applying IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.

The amendments are effective for periods beginning on or after 1st January 2023, with earlier application permitted, and will apply prospectively to changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies occurring on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period in which the Bank applies the amendments.

7. NATURE AND EXTENT OF ACTIVITIES

7.1 Foreign Currency Activities

Foreign currency activities result mainly from the CBSL’s holdings of foreign currency assets under its foreign reserves management function. The foreign reserves management portfolio comprises of foreign currency assets held for foreign exchange intervention purposes and other foreign currency assets held for trading purposes.

The foreign currency assets are held in various currencies. The majorities are denominated in United States Dollars, Australian Dollars, Euros, Sterling Pounds, Japanese Yen and New Zealand Dollars. The financial instruments held within these foreign currency portfolios consist mainly of sovereign securities, securities held under reverse-repurchase transactions or balances held with other central banks, commercial banks and custodial institutions.

The Bank also holds, from time-to-time, foreign currency assets and liabilities that arise from international market operations.

7.2 Local Currency Activities

Local currency activities arise as follows:

(i) Liquidity management operations: Liquidity management largely involves the CBSL offsetting the daily net flows to or from government or market by advancing funds to or withdrawing funds from the banking system. Most of this business is undertaken through daily open market operations.

(ii) Holding an investment portfolio comprising of Sri Lanka government securities to support the liability for currency in circulation. The Bank’s policy is to hold these investments for monetary operations and not for trading.

7.3 Trust and Custodial Activities

Amounts administered by the CBSL under custodial and administration arrangements are not included in these financial statements, as they do not form part of elements of financial statements of the Bank.

The Bank entered into swap transactions and forward contracts with Licensed Banks, Foreign Central Banks, Foreign Banks and Financial Institutions in order to maintain international stability of the Sri Lankan rupee, to strengthen the financial system stability of the country, to enhance the economic and financial cooperation among regional countries and to improve foreign exchange inflows to the country.

10.3 Derivatives are financial contracts that derive their value in response to changes in interest rates, financial instruments prices, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit risk and indices.

10.4 A significant part of derivatives portfolio of the Bank consists of currency swaps entered into as a strategy to manage exchange rate risk and the short term liquidity requirements. In a currency swap, the Bank pays/ receives a specified amount of a currency on an agreed date in exchange of another currency at agreed rates.

10.5 From Foreign Exchange Forward contracts, the Bank gets the obligation to buy or sell specific amount of foreign currency on an agreed future date at an agreed rate.

10.6 The Bank’s exposure to derivative contracts is closely monitored as part of the overall risk management of the Bank to ensure expected benefits from such derivatives are crystalized to the Bank.

11.1 IMF Quota

The IMF Quotas (capital subscriptions) are the primary source of IMF resources received from its member countries. Each country's quota is determined broadly on the basis of the relative economic size of the country. Upon joining the IMF, a country must pay 25 per cent of its quota in widely accepted foreign currencies or SDRs, and the remaining 75 per cent in its own currency. The IMF quota represents an asset of the Bank as it transacts with the IMF on its own account on behalf of the Government as per Articles of the IMF.

The IMF, based on the General Quota Review Agreement, decided to increase the quotas of each of the IMF's 189 members in January 2016 (Currently there are 190 IMF member countries). As a result, Sri Lanka's IMF quota increased to SDR 578.80 Mn on 17 February 2016 from the previous quota amount of SDR 413.40 Mn.

The amounts payable in respect of the IMF Quota is shown under the heading Quota Liability in Note 24. A member’s quota determines that country’s financial and organizational relationship with IMF, including:

Should a member withdraw from the IMF, it's quota subscription is refunded to the extent it is not needed to settle the net obligations to the IMF. However, members are not entitled for an interest on the IMF quota and hence there is no compensation for the time value of money. Therefore, under IFRS 9, this is calssifed as Fair Value Through Profit or Loss. Since there is no maturity period to compute the fair value, fair value would be equal to the amortized cost value.

(i) Subscriptions: A member's subscription to IMF resources is equal to its quota and determines the maximum amount of financial resources the member is obliged to provide to the IMF. A member must pay its subscription in full; up to 25 per cent must be paid in reserve assets specified by the IMF (SDRs or usable currencies), and the rest in the member's own currency.

(ii) Voting power: The quota defines a member's voting power in IMF decisions. IMF member’s votes comprise basic votes plus one additional vote for each SDR 100,000 of quota. The 2008 reform fixed the number of basic vote at 5.50 per cent of total votes.

(iii) Access to financing: The amount of financing a member can obtain from the IMF (access limits) is based on its quota. Under Stand-By and Extended Arrangements, for instance, a member can currently borrow up to 145 per cent of its quota annually (temporarily increased to 245 percent of quota through end 2021 as part of the Fund's COVID-19 response) and 435 per cent cumulatively. Access to finance may be higher in exceptional circumstances.

(iv) SDR allocations: Members' shares of SDR allocations are established in proportion to their quotas. A general SDR allocation equivalent to about US dollars 650 billion was made to IMF members that are participants in the SDR Department in proportion to their existing quotas in the IMF, which became effective on 23 August 2021. Of this general SDR allocation Sri Lanka's share amounted to SDR 554.80 million.

11.2 Holding of Special Drawing Rights

Holding of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) is potentially a claim on the freely usable currencies of IMF members in which holders of SDRs can exchange their SDRs for these currencies. The SDRs value as a reserve asset derives from the commitments of members to hold and accept SDRs, and to honor various obligations connected with the operation of the SDR system. The IMF ensures that the SDRs claim on freely usable currencies is being honored in two ways: by designating IMF members with a strong external position to

purchase SDRs from members with weak external positions, and through the arrangement of voluntary exchanges between participating members in a managed market. The amount shown above represents the total holding of the Bank as at the respective reporting dates.

The characteristics of holding of SDR have traits similar to cash. Hence under IFRS 9, this is calssfied as Fair Value Through Profit and Loss. Since there is no maturity period to compute the fair value, fair value would be equal to the ammmortized cost value.

11.3 Deposits with IMF – PRGF – HIPC Trust Deposit

The PRGF – HIPC (Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries) Trust Deposit was made under the agreement between the GOSL and the IMF on 21 April 2000 by transferring SDR 788,783 from Sri Lanka’s deposit in the post SCA-2 (Special Contingent Account) administered account with the IMF. This account was created under the guidance of the IMF by transferring the balance held in SCA-2 against Sri Lanka when it was decided to wind up SCA-2 by the IMF. The IMF requested the countries that had balances in the Post SCA-2 account to consider providing the balances in that account to the PRGF/HIPC Trust either as outright grant or as a means of providing a subsidy for PRGF/HIPC Loan. Accordingly GOSL agreed to transfer the funds from Post SCA–2 accounts to PRGF/HIPC Trust account, not as an outright grant, but as an interest free deposit until 2018. This was later extended until 2024.

The Asian Clearing Union (ACU) was established in 1974 at the initiative of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). The ACU was established as a mechanism to settle, on a multilateral net basis, the payments for intra-regional transactions, among Central Banks of participant countries.

such as gold holdings, foreign exchange and reserve positions in the IMF. Under certain conditions, which are set in the Articles of Agreement signed on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka by the Bank, the IMF may allocate SDRs to members in proportion to their IMF quotas.

The Articles of Agreement also allow for cancellations of SDRs, but to date, this provision has not been used. Increases in Allocation of SDR represents increases in holding of SDR as described in Note 11. Members of IMF are obligated to pay to the IMF an amount equal to its net cumulative allocation and any other amounts that may be due and payable because of its participation in the Special Drawing Rights Department at the point of termination or liquidation of IMF’s SDR Department.

The employees who have joined the Bank after 1 January 1998 and complete 10 years of service become eligible for the new pension scheme. These Pension Schemes are non-contributory pension schemes where the cost of benefits is wholly borne by the Bank. The Widows’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme for male employees and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme for female employees are open to employees of the Bank who had joined prior to 1 January 1998 whereas the new Widows’ and Orphans and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme is open for employees of the Bank who joined after 1 January 1998. Eligible Employees under the Widows’ and Orphans Pension Scheme (old) and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme (old) plans who were recruited before 1 August 1994 contribute 5% of the monthly basic salary & employees who were recruited on or after 01 August 1994 contribute 10% of the monthly basic salary whereas the eligible employees under the new Widows’ and Orphans and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme contribute 5.5% of the monthly basic salary.

The Bank also provides gratuity benefits to employees who have completed five years of service in the Bank and

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

who are not eligible for a monthly pension payment under the Employees’ Retirement Pension Schemes. In order to meet this liability, a provision is carried forward in the Statement of Financial Position, equivalent to the liability calculated using the actuarial valuation.

The Bank has a Post-Employment Medical Benefit Scheme which provides reimbursement of certain medical expenses incurred by retired employees on account of themselves, their spouses, their parents and by widows/widowers.

The Bank employed an Independent Actuary M/s K. A. Pandit, Consultant & Actuary (Mumbai) to re-assess the defined benefit obligations and the current service costs attributable to the Employees’ Retirement Pension Schemes, Widows’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme, Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme, new Widows' and Orphans' and Widowers' and Orphans' Pension scheme, Gratuity Scheme and Medical Benefit Scheme during the year.

The balance shown under Pension and Other Post Employment Benefit Plans in Statement of Financial Position differs from the net liability as per the actuary due to the following reasons:

a) The net asset position of the Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme is not reflected in the financial statements due to remote possibility of distributing any residual balance of the fund to the Bank.b) For both gratuity and medical benefit schemes, the financial statements represent the gross liability position and not the net liability as per actuary, since the Bank does not keep relevant assets in a separate fund (internally maintained).

Funds of the Employee Retirement Pension Schemes, Widows’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme, Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme are managed separately and separate books are maintained. However, Gratuity Scheme and Medical Benefit Scheme are not separated from the books of accounts of the Bank. Further, investments and investment income are recorded separately for these funds in the Bank books and the income earned from the investments are transferred back to these funds and reinvested without being distributed.

The total fair value of plan assets/investments of Rs.43,838.73 Mn (2021 – Rs. 53,334.41Mn) exceeds the total present value of all benefit obligations of Rs. 40,853.23 Mn (2021 – Rs. 66,279.21Mn) at the end of the reporting period resulting in an excess of Rs. 2,985.49 Mn (2021 – Deficit of Rs. 12,944.80 Mn).

v) RTGS Sinking Fund - This fund is built up with the charges collected from the participants for the use of the RTGS system.

vi) Pension Fund Reserve - This reserve is made up by transferring an additional Rs.3.00 Bn from 2007 profits to be used to meet any shortfalls in the pension fund given the vulnerability of the income generating capacity of the Bank to external risks. Another Rs.1.00 Bn have been transferred to this reserve from 2011 profits.

48. RISK MANAGEMENT

In pursuing its policy objectives, CBSL faces various risks, both financial and non-financial in nature. Since the materialization of any of such risks could have an adverse impact on the achievement of objectives, financial position and the reputation of CBSL, having a properly designed risk management framework in place is vital. Accordingly, CBSL has established an Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) Framework to ensure the risks faced by CBSL are properly managed.

The Risk Governance Framework which was approved by the Monetary Board comprises both a Risk Governance Structure and a Risk Management Structure covering financial and non-financial risks confronted by the Bank. The Risk Governance Structure consists of the Monetary Board (MB) and two Board sub-committees, i.e. the Board Risk Oversight Committee (BROC) and the Monetary Board Advisory Audit Committee (MBAAC). The MB holds the ultimate responsibility for the overall risk management function of the Bank and sets the “Tone at the Top”.

The BROC oversees CBSL's overall Risk Management and Compliance Functions via a formal delegation from the MB and is responsible for laying the broad strategy and policies for the Bank’s Risk Management and Compliance functions. The BROC also assists the MB to ensure a dedicated focus on risk management and compliance at the Bank.

The Risk Management Structure consists of a Non-Financial Risk Management Committee (NFRMC), Investment

Oversight Committees (IOCs) and all departments. The CBSL follows the "Three Lines of Defence" risk management model where all departments form the first line of defence. In the first line of defence, operational departments are responsible for identifying, analysing, evaluating, treating, monitoring, reviewing and reporting financial and/or operational risks related to their functions, through their respective reporting channels, in line with the risk management structure of the CBSL. Risk Management Department, as a part of the second line of defence, is responsible for facilitating the risk management process related to financial and operational risks, by coordinating relevant activities to direct and guide CBSL in this regard. With regard to operational risks, RMD reports to the BROC, through the NFRMC and with regard to financial risks, RMD reports directly to the BROC, on a periodic basis. Internal Audit Department (IAD), as the third line of defence, is responsible for providing independent objective assurance and recommendations to add value and improving the control environment relating to operations of the CBSL through audits. IAD reports the progress of the conduct of audits to the MB and MBAAC, quarterly and submits information on audit reports issued to the Auditor General on quarterly basis.

In line with the ERM framework, RMD has developed a Risk Management Policy Statement (RMPS) for the CBSL, setting out the policies for the implementation of risk management across CBSL. In this process, CBSL follows accepted standards and guidelines for managing risks, while assigning risk ownership and management among different stakeholders with clear accountability.

RMD is responsible for facilitating the financial risk management of the fund management activities of the International Reserves, and the Internal Investment Funds of CBSL, as well as the Employees' Provident Fund which is managed by CBSL as an agency function of the Government. Accordingly, RMD has formulated Investment Policy Statements (IPS), Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) and Investment Guidelines (IGs) for all three funds and reviews them regularly to incorporate any required changes. RMD also independently monitors market and credit risks pertaining to these fund management activities to ensure these investments are within the stipulated limits specified by the MB approved SAA, IPS and IGs and reports to the respective Investment Oversight Committees, the BROC and the MB on a periodic basis.

In facilitating the operational risk management, RMD reviews the Operational Risk Taxonomy of the CBSL on need basis, updating it including/excluding risk categories and incorporating any other changes required to suit the prevailing risk environment. To promote a risk culture within the bank, RMD conducts numerous risk awareness sessions for CBSL staff throughout the year at various fora. In addition, a biennial perception survey is conducted among selected staff of CBSL to determine the level of awareness with regard to the existing operational risk management mechanism in place. The survey results are used to design future awareness sessions appropriately, leading to enhancing the risk culture within CBSL and to further improve the operational risk management mechanism currently in use.

Further, RMD works with departments to provide the initial facilitation for the development of their Risk Registers and to refine these Risk Registers using a spreadsheet-based risk register format. The risk profile of CBSL is developed using these Departmental Risk Registers, enhancing the operational risk management process.

RMD continuously administers incidents reported through the Incident Reporting System, enabling the development of a central repository of incidents and tracking progress on the implementation of corrective measures. The information gathered through this system helps in identifying possible risk trends, areas of vulnerabilities and improving related risk treatment measures.

(c) Credit Exposure by Credit Rating

The following table represents the credit ratings of respective financial assets or issuers, based on the ratings of Standard and Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. Under Standard & Poor’s ratings and Fitch Ratings, AAA is the highest quality rating possible and indicates the lowest expectations of credit risk. It is assigned only in the case of exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitment. AA is very high quality grade, indicating very low expectation of credit risk, and A is an upper medium grade, indicating a low expectation of credit risk; BBB is the lowest investment grade rating, indicating that there is currently a low expectation of credit risk and exhibits adequate protection parameters, ratings lower than AAA can be modified by + or – signs to indicate relative standing within the major categories. Uncured payment defaults or distressed debt exchanges on bonds, loans, or other significant financial obligations are indicated by RD ratings.NR indicates that Standard and Poor’s or Fitch Rating have not rated the entity.

48.2 Interest Rate Risk

(a) Foreign Currency Interest Rate Sensitivity

Interest rate risk is the risk of loss arising from the changes in interest rates.

The interest rate sensitivity of the Fixed Income Securities portfolio is measured by the potential gain or loss that could incur due to a change in interest rate by 10 basis points. Sensitivity of the risk exposure of the segmented Fixed Income Securities Portfolio is given below:

Portfolio SegmentPotential Loss (USD Mn)20222021Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income0.100.16

RMD manages the interest rate risk of the foreign assets portfolio by employing the following strategies:

i) While the interest rate sensitivity measures the effect of a change in interest rates on the foreign assets portfolio, the Bank uses Modified Duration (MD) as a measurement of interest rate risk which considers interest rates as well as the duration of an investment. The MD measures the change in price of a security for a 1% change in the interest rates (yield). A higher MD indicates a higher risk. Hence, the Bank sets an appropriate MD from time to time considering the developments in the financial markets, portfolio characteristics and the risk appetite of the bond portfolio. The MDs of the foreign assets portfolio are tabulated below:

Investment SegmentModified Duration20222021Capital Market (Fixed Income Securities)3.363.69

ii) Since the MD does not account for large changes in prices, another measure used for management of interest rate risk of the foreign reserves portfolio is convexity. Convexity measures the extent of deviation in bond price-yield curve from a straight line representing duration. It allows improving the duration approximation for bond price changes. Convexity is a change in duration for

a change in yield. It measures the predictive error of Modified Duration. In other words, it is the second derivative of a security's price with respect to its yield.

Convexity of the segmented Fixed IncomeSecurities portfolio

Portfolio SegmentPotential Loss (USD Mn)20222021Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income0.1450.180

iii) Value at Risk (VaR)

VaR summarizes in a single number the downside risk of the portfolio, under normal market conditions, from financial market movements. Therefore, VaR is the maximum loss over a target horizon such that there is a low, pre-specified probability that the actual loss will be larger. VaR gives a number, in terms of money, which can be aggregated across risks and positions. VaR is calculated for a 10 day period at 99% confidence interval using Historical and Parametric methods.

Portfolio SegmentValue at Risk (VaR)20222021Historical ParametricFair Value through Other Comprehensive Income0.650.630.48

iv) Trading & Open Position Limits

Bank assigns specific dealer limits on intra-day and overnight position limits for individual dealers by way of "Dealing Authority ".

(b) Local Currency Interest Rate Sensitivity

The Government Securities portfolio is recorded in the Statement of Financial Position of the Bank at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income as per the Business Model assessment under IFRS 9. This portfolio is not an investment portfolio, as the Bank does not purchase Government Securities with the intention of earning an interest income. The Bank purchases or sells Government Securities to inject rupee liquidity into the domestic market or to absorb liquidity from the market in the course of carrying out its monetary policy operations in relation to one of its core objectives, maintaining economic and price stability. Hence, the volume of Government Securities in the Bank’s portfolio is largely determined by its monetary policy operations. However, the portfolio may include Government Securities purchased under Section 112 of the Monetary Law Act. In addition, the basic interest rates in the rupee market, the Standing Deposit Rate and the Standing Lending Rate are policy rates determined by the Bank in the course of implementing its monetary policy. Moreover, the Bank's actions in injecting rupee liquidity or absorbing liquidity from the market have a significant impact on general rupee market interest rates. Thus, changes in the interest income earned from the Government Securities portfolio, which arise from changes in the volume of the Bank’s Government Securities portfolio, as well as changes in interest rates, are primarily a consequence of the Bank’s monetary policy actions or monetary financing, rather than due to investment decisions. Therefore, the Bank does not consider interest rate sensitivities arising from local currency assets

48.3 Foreign Currency Risk

Foreign currency activities result mainly from the Bank’s holding of foreign currency assets under its foreign reserve management function. Volatility of the foreign exchange markets may expose the Bank to exchange risk. The Monetary Board and International Reserves Investment Oversight Committee (IRIOC) have set percentage holdings of different currencies in its foreign Reserves. In

deciding on the currency allocation, public debt repayment requirements are given due consideration. Accordingly, the Bank holds most major currencies such as US Dollars, Sterling Pounds, Japanese Yen, Euro, Australian Dollars, Chinese Yuan and New Zealand Dollars. Compliance with limits established for foreign currency positions are continously monitored.

48.5 Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the difficulty that an entity will encounter in raising funds at short notice to meet commitments associated with financial instruments. Liquidity risk is also the risk that an entity will have to sell a financial asset quickly at much less than its fair value.

a) Liquidity is a key consideration in determining the composition of the Bank’s foreign currency assets. This reflects the potential requirement to liquidate foreign reserves for intervention purposes and to settle other commitments such as public debt and IMF Loan repayments when the need arises. The Bank has adopted the following measures aimed at ensuring quick access to funds:

• Liquid asset ratios based on the liquidity characteristics of securities held

• Limits on maximum proportion of reserves that may be held in one currency and with one counterparty

b) In order to reduce the level of liquidity risk arising out of the local currency activities, particularly open market operations, the Bank uses highly liquid marketable instruments such as Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds as collateral. It manages the daily liquidity position of the banking system by way of infusing into or withdrawal from the system, using instruments such as repo /reverse repo, CBSL securities and USD /LKR Swaps.

50. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES

50.1 Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities

‘Fair Value’ is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Bank has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.

The determination of fair value for financial assets and liabilities for which there is no observable market price requires the use of valuation techniques as described in accounting policy Note 5.2. For financial instruments that trade infrequently and have little price transparency, fair value is less objective, and requires varying degrees

of judgement depending on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty of market factors, pricing assumptions and other risks affecting the specific instrument. The fair value hierarchy of financial instruments is given below:

Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

Level 3: Fair value measurements using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

Land & Buildings

Valuation MethodLand is valued using market approach with direct comparison method, whereby assets are compared to recent sales with no added or nominal added improvement value, making adjustments for points of difference to derive the fair value.

Depreciated Current Replacement Cost (DRC) method is used in valuing all the buildings except Central Point and White Aways considering that the assets controlled by the public sector entities that provide service to the community are not traded on an open liquid market.

Income approach is used to value the other buildings which values the property based on estimated future income, profits or cash flow that are converted (discounted) to a single current amount.

Under the Market Approach, estimated fair value would get increased/(decreased) if;

Price per perch would get higher/(lower)Price per square foot would get higher/(lower)Depreciation rate for building would get lower/(higher)

Under Income Approach, estimated fair value would get increased/(decreased) if;

Gross annual rentals would get higher/(lower)Years purchase would get higher/(lower)

Derivatives

Derivative valuation models use forward prices (calculated by extrapolating the forward points available in the market) and discount rates calculated based on zero coupon yield curves of the respective currencies as of the valuation date. If the instrument that is valued contains a margin, adjustments are made to the forward prices and/or the interest rates to represent the impact of the margin rate.

- Securites Sold under Agreements to Repurchase- Securities Lending- Securities Pledged

55.1 Transferred Financial Assets that are not Derecognized in their Entirety

a. Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase transactions are performed as part of the Monetary Policy operations of the Bank and continues to be recognised in their entirety under "Sri Lanka Government Securities" in the Statement of Financial Position because it retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. The cash consideration to be paid and the interest accured there on are recognized under Securities sold under repurchase agreements in the local financial liabilities of the Statement of Financial Position.

b. Securities Lending

Securities lending describes the established market practice by which, for a fee, securities are transferred temporarily from one party (the lender, i.e. CBSL), to another (the borrower); the borrower is obliged to return them either on demand or at the end of any agreed term. Currently a selected Clearing House (CH) functions as the custodian for the supranational bonds and bonds issued by different issuers. CBSL has signed an agreement which enable CH to lend at their wish depending on the demand for those bonds. Since the lending does not involve CBSL and CH lends them directly to the borrowers, the process is called auto bond lending. At the end of each month, custodian will send fee income for auto bond lending, if any for the bonds which they lent under auto bond lending programme. The Bank continues to recognize the securities in their entirety in the Statement of Financial Position because it retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. These securities are presented in the Statement of Financial Position as "Securities at Fair value through other Comprehensive Income".

3. CENTRE FOR BANKING STUDIES

Centre for Banking Studies (CBS) of Central Bank, has been leading capacity development initiatives for the financial sector professionals in Sri Lanka for more than four decades. In addition to these capacity building activities, CBS hosts various discussions on time relevant topics with economic interest, to create awareness among stakeholders. In 2022, CBS concentrated primarily on addressing the fast changing training needs of the financial sector fueled by developments in technology and assisted its stakeholders in achieving their professional goals by providing them with cutting edge skills and in depth knowledge needed to elevate the banking and finance sector to greater heights. Even though there were disruptions caused by the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic crisis, and social unrest, CBS continued to maintain its momentum throughout the year.

In order to address novel and emerging subject areas with high demand and to further enhance existing programmes to meet current needs, CBS introduced a number of new training interventions in 2022. These training interventions, which were offered not only to the Sri Lankan financial industry, but also to interested parties across the region, covered a diverse range of subject areas including banking and finance, risk management and compliance, treasury operations, accounting and financial management, law and regulations, research and data analysis, economics, human resources and general management, rural sector development and microfinance, information technology, and soft skills.

CBS conducted a total of 140 programmes which consisted of 65 prescheduled programmes (along with the newly introduced 10 programmes), 19 special programmes (tailor made based on requests by various institutions and developed considering the market demand), 4 certificate courses, and 4 international programmes during the year 2022. Establishing another milestone, CBS introduced a regional knowledge sharing

initiative in 2022 with the aim of establishing the footprint of CBS as a leading capacity building partner in the Asian region. This programme was focused on “Fintech Developments and Central Bank Digital Currency” and was attended by number of foreign participants from the Asian region. Further, CBS launched the quarterly Expert Panel Discussions (EPD) series in March 2022 with the objective of creating a platform to discuss current economic topics with the participation of experts representing different facets of such developments. Through these discussions, CBS expects policymakers to understand different perspectives on issues while a greater level of awareness is raised among the business community and the public, enabling a smooth policy implementation process. In addition to that, CBS successfully conducted an Annual High-Level Seminar on “Confronting the Current Foreign Exchange Crisis in Sri Lanka: Lessons from Global Experience” targeting senior level officials of both state and private sectors.

Furthermore, CBS continued to play the role of an active partner in capacity building efforts for the implementation of sustainable finance in Sri Lanka with the collaboration of International Finance Corporation (IFC). Apart from that, international institutes including the South East Asian Central Banks (SEACEN) Research and Training Centre and Deutsche Bundesbank collaborated with CBS to further enrich the programme line up of CBS by delivering programmes on “FinTech Regulation and Supervision”, “Recovery and Resolution on Credit Institutions”, and “Monetary Policy Implementation”. Further, CBS launched a new Certificate Course on “Macroeconomics for Journalists” designed specifically for media personnel with the intention of enhancing their knowledge on economic concepts and the financial system.

Honoring the social obligation of increasing financial and economic literacy of the nation, CBS hosted a number of knowledge sharing forums, including 20 public events covering various subject areas. Further, serving the educational fraternity of the country, 8 programmes were conducted for undergraduates and school students. Among these, there were 2 newly initiated programmes on financial literacy targeting middle school children.

Furthermore, in the year 2022, CBS continued to coordinate 2 television serials, namely “Thakshilawa” and “Ariwootroo” of which 20 episodes were aired in Sinhala and Tamil, targeting Advanced Level economics students. CBS also conducted a series of regional level programmes in collaboration with Regional Offices and the Regional Development Department of the Central Bank. Throughout the year 10,447 participants attended CBS programmes both in person and online.

Improving the efficiency and smoothness of CBS operations, an Institutional Management System (IMS) was introduced in parallel to the newly launched CBS interactive website in 2022.

CBS launched its course catalogue for the year 2023 at the end of 2022, expressing its continuous commitment to enrich financial professionals with the required knowledge and skills in order to pave the way for stable and resilient financial system.

4. COMMUNICATIONS

In 2022, amid many uncertainties, the Central Bank engaged in a tiered communication strategy to systematically reach out to its various target audiences, including the general public, through a range of communication channels, to share information, to provide greater clarity on policy decisions and their impact on the economy, and to influence expectations. The Communications Department (CMD) assisted the other departments to meet such internal and external communication requirements on a timely basis.

4.1 Internal Communications

CMD supported the Monetary Policy endeavors of the Central Bank through appropriate information management; in particular, its analysis of Market Sentiments and Policy Rate predictions as reported by the media at the beginning of the Monetary Policy Review Cycles and Monetary Policy Reach Report within a week after each press conference, to assess the effectiveness of the reach of the core messages of Monetary Policy Review (MPR) while identifying the reactions by the media to the Monetary Policy Decisions of the Central Bank. CMD was also instrumental in providing live coverage for its press conferences and other important events to the desktops of the staff to ensure they were well informed about the happenings at the Central Bank. An online Knowledge Sharing Platform was introduced in 2022 to break silos in the work environment and to share information pertaining to the policies and processes of respective departments among the staff, whereby 8 timely topics were discussed through the MS Teams platform. To ensure that all staff is well versed on developments in the local economy as well as the global financial markets, CMD shared all relevant online news among the staff via email, supplemented by the Library and Information Center (LIC) of CMD, which identifies all relevant newspaper articles, which are uploaded to the intranet platform. All critical news items are also brought to the attention of the Senior Management. Considering the increasing price of newsprint, LIC embarked on an electronic newspaper drive, to reduce costs. LIC also disseminated information by way of e-books, specific chapters of books, scholarly articles, etc. among the staff on a regular basis. In addition to that, LIC relaunched the book review competition for staff in October 2022, in celebration of National Reading Month, and 2 winners were selected. Similarly, the official internal newsletter “Kauluwa” containing news and articles featuring the creative skills of the Central Bank staff was digitally published and uploaded to the Mansala, on a quarterly basis.

4.2 External Communications

As in previous years, CMD continued to send SMS alerts on Policy Interest Rates and Exchange Rates (Telegraphic Transfer Rates) in collaboration with ERD & IOD respectively. Furthermore, CMD issued Middle Rate of USD/ LKR Spot Exchange Rate and Variation Margin in all three languages

to senior officials of all licensed commercial banks with the assistance of IOD. In addition, CMD collaborated with the Statistics Department (STD) to disseminate key economic indicators on daily, weekly and monthly bases during 2022.

CMD issued 1,860 press releases in all 3 languages highlighting the key decisions of the Monetary Board in relation to MPR, financial institutions, and financial markets. As envisaged in the beginning of the year, CMD organised 8 Press Conferences on the MPR which were live streamed via social media channels of the Central Bank to ensure that the messages were relayed to a larger audience. CMD also arranged 4 virtual awareness sessions at the Regional Offices of Nuwara Eliya, Trincomalee, Matale and Matara, in collaboration with the ERD, Regional Development Department (RDD) and Centre for Banking Studies (CBS), to explain the rationales for certain decisions of the Central Bank, in simple Sinhala and Tamil.

CMD also facilitated several additional press conferences on Foreign Remittances, the Current Economic Situation, and one press conference at the request of International Monetary Fund (IMF). Meanwhile, 12 Gazette notifications and 141 press notices, including advertisements, were also issued by CMD as per the requirements of other departments during 2022.

In order to inculcate good habits and enhance their knowledge of economics and financial literacy levels at a younger age, CMD organised a regional level awareness workshop for school children in Kekirawa and Rajanganaya in collaboration with the Regional Office in Anuradhapura. To coincide with this event, to propagate a financially literate society, art and essay competitions were arranged on the theme of “the need to save on a regular basis”. A book donation drive was also organised with the assistance of Library and Information Centre (LIC) of the Central Bank for which employees contributed by donating books. This was in addition to the 52 awareness programmes on the Central Bank’s objectives and functions and other selected topics related to the economy, banking, and finance organised by CMD at the Central Bank Head Office premises, that are arranged upon request, with a guided tour of the currency museum for school children and undergraduates. In addition, CMD organised programmes targeting Members of Parliament to update their knowledge on “The Current Economic Situation in Sri Lanka and the Way Forward” and another programme organised by CMD targeting officials of Divisional Secretariats of Balapitiya and Ambalangoda, to enhance their awareness of “Unauthorised / Illegal Financial Activities including Pyramid Schemes”.

Further, CMD coordinated with six departments of the Central Bank and the National Institute of Education (NIE) as the lead department / secretary of the appointed committee to propose suggestions to the syllabus of the newly introduced subject “Entrepreneurship and Financial Literacy”, particularly topics related to Central Bank functions in order to increase the financial literacy levels of school children.

With the support of relevant departments of the bank, CMD continued maintenance of the updated official website of Central Bank in all 3 languages in compliance with the National Language Policy throughout the year. In response to frequent public inquiries pertaining to the functions performed by the bank, all e-mails received via the Central Bank general mail were reviewed and sent to the relevant departments for direct response. CMD also responded to certain inquiries where information was available.

The Tamil Translations Unit, established at CMD to meet Tamil translation requirements of press releases, newspaper advertisements, Directions, and other publications including the Annual Report, engaged in 1,161 translations comprising 5,022 pages during the year.

Furthermore, two radio discussions and three TV programmes were arranged by CMD in collaboration with other departments to improve the financial literacy levels of the general public and provide useful information on related areas such as foreign remittances and Employee Provident Fund services.

LIC catered to requests from university undergraduates and other researchers who needed information for their research activities and facilitated access to the library for 36 university interns for their discussions, lectures, and studies.

As in the previous year, the CMD continued to publish these periodicals online: “Satahana”, “News Survey” and “Vaippaham”, providing a platform for authors at the Central Bank to contribute to the development of knowledge in their respective fields.

The photography coverage of all the major events conducted by the Central Bank was handled by the Photographic Unit of CMD. Overall, 160 events were covered, 64 of which comprised videographic coverage. CMD also engaged in a host of other related activities such as photo and video editing work and liaised closely with the Central Bank Awareness Team to develop new video content capturing moments from press conferences, highlighting the features of loans facilitated by the Regional Development Department (RDD), the benefits of the EPF Online Service, the dire consequences of exposure to scams, etc.

5. CURRENCY

The Central Bank has the sole right and authority to issue currency in Sri Lanka which includes both currency notes and coins as stipulated in the Monetary Law Act (MLA) No. 58 of 1949. The Currency Department (CRD) of the Central Bank handles functions relating to this statutory responsibility vested with Monetary Board. Despite the challenges of COVID-19, during 2022, CRD continuously engaged in building and maintaining public confidence in the currency by preserving its value and integrity and making available adequate stocks to meet the demand for currency, which is essential for smooth functioning of the economy.

5.2 Currency Management

Issuance of good quality currency notes and coins into circulation, acceptance of currency deposits from Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs), and withdrawal of unserviceable (unfit) currency notes and coins from circulation are the key functions of currency management. Following are the activities carried out during the year 2022 to ensure the effectiveness of currency management:

(a) Currency Printing and Minting

CRD placed an order for 495 million pieces of new currency notes for the year 2022 to ensure good quality notes in circulation and sufficient stocks to meet the public demand. There were no orders placed for circulation coins during the year as CRD had adequate coin stock to cater the public demand.

(b) Issuance of Currency

During 2022, CRD continued the facilitation of direct exchange of serviceable (fit) currency notes among LCBs which was initiated in 2020 due to the pandemic situation. This resulted in a reduction of currency notes issued by the Central Bank in 2022. Currency notes and coins issued by CRD for circulation in the country during the year 2022 amounted to Rs.384.5 billion and Rs.1.0 billion, respectively.

The Central Bank officially launched 2 circulation standard commemorative coins in the denomination of Rs.20 to mark the 150th Anniversary of Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo and the 150th Anniversary of Census of Population and Housing (CPH) in Sri Lanka.

6. DOMESTIC OPERATIONS

6.1 Functions of DOD

The Domestic Operations Department (DOD) is entrusted with responsibilities relevant to both price and economic stability and financial system stability objectives of the Central Bank. Accordingly, the major functions of DOD include implementing monetary policy by way of conducting Open Market Operations (OMOs) with Participating Institutions (PIs), regulating statutory reserves of Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs), performing actions related to the banker and the official depository of the Government, government agencies and other institutions, providing Intraday Liquidity Facility (ILF) to Dealer Direct Participants, and regulating and supervising of the Authorised Money Brokers (AMBs).

6.2 Implementation of Monetary Policy

6.2.1 Open Market Operations (OMOs)

DOD conducts OMOs in order to maintain the Average Weighted Call Money Rate (AWCMR), which is the operating target of the current Flexible Inflation Targeting framework, at desired levels with less volatility in line with the prevailing monetary policy stance. AWCMR, which recorded an upward adjustment in 2022 remained stagnant at the upper bound of the Standing Rate Corridor (SRC). Call money market activities remained low since April 2022 due to increased uncertainty in the markets, particularly on account of the speculation on fiscal sector developments.

(a) Estimating Money Market Liquidity

DOD estimates domestic money market liquidity on a daily basis based on a number of factors. This estimation is used to address liquidity needs of the market participants through appropriate market operations in consistence with the monetary policy stance of the Central Bank. In this regard, the impact of monetary operations initiated by the Central Bank as well as the

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2022

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 86

Part II

liquidity effects of autonomous factors, such as changes in currency in circulation, foreign exchange related transactions of the Central Bank, changes in the reserve position of LCBs, and transactions of the Government with Central Bank are taken into consideration. During 2022, DOD performed liquidity estimation in a challenging environment. The money market liquidity deficit stood at Rs. 335.75 billion at the beginning of the year and remained at negative levels throughout the year. However, the liquidity deficit recorded a gradual decline since the second quarter of 2022 and recorded a deficit of Rs. 231.25 billion by end December 2022.

(b) Recommendations to the Market Operations Committee (MOC)

MOC is entrusted with the task of translating overall monetary policy considerations adopted by the Monetary Board into daily monetary operations. DOD provides inputs on money market developments and liquidity estimations on domestic money market to the MOC in the process of implementing the monetary policy stance adopted by the Monetary Board. Accordingly, upon reviewing the effects on rupee market liquidity due to developments in the domestic money market and the foreign exchange markets on a daily basis, DOD proposes actions for the consideration of the MOC in managing money market liquidity and short term interest rates. MOC considers the estimated liquidity conditions, desired level of the operating target, liquidity distribution among money market participants, and need for devising appropriate market signals, among others, and thereby decides on appropriate actions to be implemented. During 2022, DOD conducted monetary operations to address asymmetric liquidity distribution in the domestic money market and to reduce liquidity stress among certain PIs.

(c) Conducting Auctions

In 2022, DOD conducted auctions under OMOs to absorb and inject liquidity from and to the money market on a need basis in support of overall liquidity management operations. The following auctions were conducted in 2022, which were instrumental in minimising undue pressures in the domestic money market (Table II-7):

(i) Repurchase (Repo) Auctions

During early 2022, overnight and short term repo auctions were conducted to absorb excess liquidity from the domestic money market. Accordingly, overnight repo auctions were conducted to absorb liquidity on an overnight basis, while short term repo auctions were conducted to absorb liquidity for a period up to one week on the basis of same day settlement.

(ii) Reverse Repurchase (Reverse Repo) Auctions

Long term reverse repo auctions were also conducted in 2022 to inject liquidity to the domestic money market to reduce the liquidity stress among certain banks. Such long term reverse repo auctions were conducted by DOD, with the settlement on the next business day, in order to inject liquidity to address persistent liquidity needs of the market.

(iii) Outright Transactions

During 2022, outright sales of Treasury bill auctions were conducted by DOD to absorb liquidity injected through the primary purchase of Treasury bills by the Central Bank on a permanent basis from the money market. Further, attempts were made to conduct outright purchase of Treasury bill auctions towards end 2022 to inject permanent liquidity to the market though such auctions were not successful. Treasury bond outright auctions were not conducted during the year 2022.

6.2.2 Administering and Monitoring the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR)

The SRR determines the required reserves that each LCB should maintain, in proportion to the total average rupee deposit liabilities of the respective bank in the settlement account with the Central Bank, in terms of the provisions under Section 93 of the Monetary Law Act (MLA), No. 58 of 1949. DOD is responsible for monitoring the compliance of LCBs. During 2022, DOD continued to administer and monitor the compliance of LCBs with the SRR, which remained unchanged at 4 per cent throughout the year.

6.2.3 Administering the Bank Rate

The Bank rate, which is termed as the Lender of Last Resort (LOLR) rate, is used to provide emergency loans to banking institutions under the provisions of Sections 86 and 87 of the MLA. Since 16 April 2020, this rate was linked to the SLFR with +300 basis points and allowed to adjust automatically. However, with effect from the close of business on 03 November 2022, the Bank rate was linked to the Average Weighted New Deposits Rate (AWNDR) with a margin of +700 basis points so that it was adjusted based on market conditions. Further, taking into account the trends in the domestic money market, the margin of the Bank rate was reduced to +300 basis points with effect from the close of business on 02 January 2023. During 2022, no request was received by the Central Bank for soliciting emergency loans by the banking institutions, while the Central Bank has further strengthened the Emergency Loans and Advances (ELA) framework.

6.3 Functions Relating to Commercial Banks, Primary Dealers and the Government

6.3.1 Accounts of Financial Institutions

By offering settlement accounts to eligible participants of the Real Time Gross Settlements (RTGS) system, the Central Bank performs a vital role in the functioning of the economy through facilitating safe and efficient payments and settlements. This is performed through facilitating large value payments and supporting to the operations of the inter-bank money market.

The General Ledger (GL) accounts are maintained by DOD to facilitate the clearance of payments and settlements and for the settlement of payments of scripless security transactions among the RTGS participants. Further, LCBs use the same accounts for the purpose of maintaining their reserves as per the SRR. As at end 2022, DOD maintained GL accounts for 24 LCBs, National Savings Bank, and 8 Standalone Primary Dealers (SPDs).

6.3.2 Maintaining Government Accounts

In performing the functions relating to the role of the Central Bank as the banker to the Government, DOD continued to provide banking facilities to government departments, agencies and institutions and certain foreign entities on behalf of the Government. Accordingly, DOD maintained 48 such accounts during 2022. Around 90 per cent of the transaction volume of such accounts was related to the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury (DST) Account, the Public Debt Department’s Current Account, the Inland Revenue Commissioner’s VAT Refund Account, and the President’s Fund Account.

In terms of the Section 89 of the MLA, the Central Bank provides provisional advances to the Government, not exceeding 10 per cent of the estimated revenue of the Government for the financial year in which they are made. Such advances are used by the Government as a revolving credit facility and shall be repayable within a period not exceeding six months. At the beginning of 2022, the maximum available amount to be utilised under provisional advances was increased by Rs. 73.01 billion to Rs. 225.05 billion based on the government revenue estimate for the year 2022. However, with the revised interim government budget approved by the Parliament by end 2022, the maximum utilisable amount under provisional advances was increased by Rs. 12.32 billion. Accordingly, as at end of 2022, the provisional advances stood at Rs. 237.37 billion, compared to Rs. 152.04 billion reported as at end of 2021. Based on the approved government budget for the year 2023, the provisional advances to the Government increased by Rs. 107.58 billion to Rs. 344.95 billion at the beginning of 2023.

6.4 Provision of Intra-Day Liquidity Facility (ILF)

DOD ensures the smooth and efficient functioning of the RTGS system by providing ILF to the Dealer Direct Participants. This facility is provided free of charge against the collateral of Treasury bills and Treasury bonds, which are valued at their current market prices with a sufficient haircut to absorb any variations in market prices during the day. The total value and the average daily value of ILF drawn during the year amounted to Rs. 157,166.18 billion and Rs. 657.60 billion, respectively. This indicates a significant increase in ILF utilisation during 2022 compared to the previous year, which amounted to a total of Rs. 50,777.45 billion with a daily average of Rs. 215.16 billion.

6.5 Regulating and Supervising Authorised Money Brokers

Money brokers perform an intermediary role in the money, foreign exchange, and government securities markets. The Money Broking Regulations, No. 1 of 2018 issued (by repealing the Money Broking Regulations issued in 2013 and 2016) under the provisions of Section 10 (c) of the MLA, empowers the Director of DOD to examine the operations of Authorised Money Brokers (AMBs) operating in Sri Lanka to ensure their professional conduct in the process of efficient price discovery in the domestic money market. Accordingly, nine (9) companies were issued with a “Certificate of Authorisation” under the above regulations, and designated as “Authorised Money Brokers”, by end December 2022. During the year, DOD conducted annual on-site examinations for all AMBs.

7. ECONOMIC RESEARCH

As per Section 25 of the Monetary Law Act (MLA), No. 58 of 1949, the Economic Research Department (ERD) is vested with the responsibility of compiling data and conducting economic research for the guidance of the Monetary Board and the Governor in formulating, implementing, and executing policies and measures and for the information of the public in the subjects of money and banking and other economic subjects of general interest. ERD effectively discharged its responsibilities amidst an unprecedently challenging domestic and international environment in 2022. In discharging its responsibilities, ERD continued to provide comprehensive analyses of macroeconomic developments and made timely policy recommendations to the management and the Monetary Board in order to facilitate policy decisions towards achieving its core objective of economic and price stability. The research agenda of the department was focused on a multitude of macroeconomic challenges faced by the Sri Lankan economy throughout the year, extending to monetary policy, growth and inflation dynamics, fiscal sector, and external sector, among others. As the primary source of statistics on monetary aggregates and balance of payments, ERD continued its crucial role in disseminating statistics and other macroeconomic information to all stakeholders, including the general public, through printed and electronic media, in addition to numerous in-person engagements during the year. Contributing to its already established tradition of conducting policy-oriented

research and knowledge-sharing activities, the department strengthened its own capabilities during the year, while promoting the conduct of research within the Central Bank. In fulfilling its objective of sharing knowledge, the department conducted several awareness programmes to educate its stakeholders, including the general public, which provided an opportunity to explain the functioning of the economy and ongoing challenges in balancing policy tradeoffs. As the focal point of contact in maintaining international relations of the Central Bank in the capacity of the monetary authority of the country, ERD played a critical role in establishing and maintaining close cooperation with foreign counterparts, international agencies, and other stakeholders. Especially, ERD played the anchor role in facilitating negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) on matters relating to the Central Bank, prepared technical inputs for the meetings with the IMF, while responding to their technical level queries on numerous occasions. ERD provided inputs to facilitate the ongoing debt restructuring efforts of the Government, thereby closely coordinating with financial and legal advisors appointed for carrying out the debt restructuring process. Further, ERD coordinated several Missions from the IMF on EFF and technical assistance in multiple areas during 2022.

7.1 Maintaining Economic and Price Stability

ERD continued to compile, monitor, and analyse trends and developments in the monetary, external, real, and fiscal sectors of the economy as well as global economic trends, while producing projections and forecasts to facilitate proactive and data driven monetary policy decision making by the Monetary Board. As the Secretariat to the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), ERD facilitated eight scheduled MPC meetings. Enabling the MPC to make informed policy recommendations to the Monetary Board on the appropriate monetary policy stance of the Central Bank, comprehensive reports were presented on developments in the economy, monetary conditions, external sector issues, and model based macroeconomic projections, such as inflation and growth forecasts. Further, ERD provided analyses and reports to the Senior Management of the Central Bank on various economic issues, highlighting appropriate policy measures required to ensure macroeconomic stability. Meanwhile, the Stakeholder Engagement Committee (SEC) was established in July 2022 by replacing the Monetary Policy Consultative Committee (MPCC) and the Financial System Stability Consultative Committee (FSSCC) of the Central Bank, which were in operation previously. The Committee consists of a cross section of stakeholders, including eminent professionals, academics, and private sector personnel. SEC generally meets on a quarterly basis and the meetings are facilitated by ERD along with secretarial assistance. ERD continued to improve inhouse modelling and forecasting capacity with technical assistance received from the IMF, as a part of continuous efforts in extending the analytical capacity that contributes to monetary policy decision making and communication. As

Part II - 89

monetary policy communication plays a major role in the flexible inflation targeting framework, ERD initiated several measures to improve external communication and enhance awareness among the general public and other stakeholders with a view to anchoring inflation expectations in line with the envisaged inflation path over the medium term. ERD published eight press releases on Monetary Policy Review, informing the public of the monetary policy stance of the Monetary Board. ERD facilitated the Monetary Policy Review press conferences organised by the Communications Department (CMD) that were livestreamed via various online and social media platforms enabling a wide outreach of real time monetary policy communication. Contributing to the outreach efforts of the Central bank, ERD provided resource personnel to facilitate webinars coordinated by the Regional Offices of the Central Bank following monetary policy announcements. ERD also contributed to knowledge sharing sessions conducted by CMD to enhance the technical understanding of the Central Bank staff on selected areas related to the functions of the Central Bank. Meanwhile, measures were also taken by ERD to further improve the compilation and dissemination of monetary and interest rate statistics during the year. Accordingly, ERD streamlined the monetary and interest rate data collection process following the changes to financial reporting standards, while commencing the collection of more granular, high frequency data on interest rates statistics.

7.2 Maintaining External Sector Stability

With the aim of ensuring external sector stability of the economy, ERD continued to provide appropriate and timely policy advice and recommendations on the external sector to MPC and the Monetary Board by collecting, compiling, and analysing statistics related to international trade, external finance, exchange rates, and Gross Official Reserves (GOR), on a regular basis. Amidst the challenging and vulnerable economic conditions, ERD evaluated the pressures on the exchange rate regularly and continued to make presentations and submissions to the Senior Management and the Monetary Board on external sector developments and issues along with required policy measures to address external sector vulnerabilities. As per Section 114 of the MLA, ERD continued to assess the monetary implications of proposed foreign loans, as requested by the Government, prior to its expected borrowings. ERD continued the publication of external sector related statistics, such as the Balance of Payments (BOP) and the International Investment Position (IIP) published in line with the BPM6 format on a quarterly basis and the International Reserve Data Template (RDT) published on a monthly basis, while making timely submissions related to Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) to the World Bank and direct investment data for the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS) on an annual basis. Further, ERD continued to conduct several surveys during the year to ensure the accuracy and timeliness of external sector data, which include monthly surveys on inward workers’ remittances, the Annual International Investment

Survey (AIIS) to collect data on foreign assets and liabilities of the private sector, and surveys related to trade in services covering the resident and non-resident airlines, shipping lines, telecommunication, construction, and insurance sectors. During the year, ERD implemented the International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS), a project to collect and compile granular level information about cross border foreign currency transactions that take place through the banking sector. Further, ERD facilitated engagements with foreign counterparts, particularly the correspondence with regard to the foreign debt restructuring process and reaching a staff level agreement in September 2022 for the IMF-EFF arrangement.

7.3 Proactive Policy Advice

ERD continued its crucial role in providing policy advice to the Monetary Board, Government, and other stakeholders on monetary policy, exchange rate policy, international trade, and fiscal sector related issues, among others, during 2022. Accordingly, ERD prepared and submitted confidential reports and delivered presentations to the Hon. Minister of Finance, Hon. Members of the Parliament, several Parliamentary Committees etc., in addition to the submissions made to the Senior Management and the Monetary Board. In accomplishing the department’s statutory role, ERD submitted several confidential reports to the Hon. Minister of Finance under Sections 64 and 68 of the MLA, highlighting the current status and outlook of the monetary and external sectors, while recommending proactive measures in order to ensure economic and price stability and external sector stability. In line with Section 116(1) of the MLA, a confidential report known as the September 15th Report, which underlines the effect of the current fiscal policy on the ability of the Central Bank to achieve its objectives, was submitted to the Hon. Minister of Finance, along with a set of policy proposals to be included in the National Budget for 2023.

While attending Monetary Board meetings on a regular basis for the purpose of providing necessary policy inputs, the Director of Economic Research (DER) continued to serve as a member of several internal committees, including the MPC, Market Operations Committee (MOC), Financial System Stability Committee (FSSC), Domestic Debt Management Committee (DDMC), Tender Boards for the issuance of government securities, Training Committee, and Library Advisory Committee during 2022. Further, DER continued to serve as an observer in the Internal Investment Oversight Committee (IIOC) and International Reserve Investment Oversight Committee (IRIOC). In addition, DER also contributed to other regular and special forums and other internal committee meetings and meetings of Chairpersons and Chief Executive Officers of financial institutions, treasurers of licensed banks etc., by providing inputs on macroeconomic developments and subjects of topical interest. Moreover, DER and senior members of ERD represented numerous committees and boards of several external institutions, including the Committee on Fixing Benchmark Price for sale of Mineral Sands by the

Contributing to the Government’s efforts to revive the negotiations of free trade agreements, DER and officials of ERD participated in committees and subcommittees formed for such negotiations, such as the Investment subcommittee in the China-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement negotiations hosted by the Board of Investments of Sri Lanka.

7.4 Statutory Publications and Dissemination of Data and Information

As per the statutory requirements under the MLA, ERD prepared the Annual Report of the Central Bank for 2021, in all three languages with the assistance of other departments of the Central Bank. This annual flagship publication of the Central Bank was presented to the Hon. Minister of Finance and was made available to the public by the end of April 2022. In addition, Recent Economic Developments - Highlights

Moreover, with the aim of enhancing the awareness of the general public, media statements and press statements on emerging matters were released in addition to the regular monetary policy review and external sector developments. ERD disseminated statistics covering all sectors of the economy in compliance with the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). DER appeared in several discussions in the electronic media on topical economic issues, while representing the Central Bank in external engagements. ERD also prepared talking points and presentations for the Governor for the speeches delivered at various fora, while sharing information with Hon. Ministers on various topics.

7.5 Engaging in Policy Research and Knowledge Sharing

ERD continued to inculcate a culture of research within the department and the Central Bank in order to stimulate research and analysis to facilitate the policy making of the Central Bank. The Research Advisory Committee (RAC), an internal committee formulated with the aim of fostering the research culture in the ERD, continued to provide guidance in research related tasks and knowledge sharing activities. Accordingly, RAC members served as the resource personnel to several training courses on research methodology, including ‘Research in Economics’ and ‘Applied Econometrics - Practical Approach Using EViews Software’, in collaboration with the Centre for Banking Studies (CBS), while actively contributing to research activities guiding researchers to enhance the research skills of officers of the Central Bank. For the third consecutive year, ERD organised a joint annual international research workshop in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) and Asia Pacific Applied Economic Association (APAEA) focusing on Emerging Issues for Macroeconomic Stability in September 2022. At this workshop, ERD staff presented three research papers prepared jointly with researchers from APAEA. In August 2022, ERD researchers presented a country paper at the SAARCFINANCE Virtual Seminar on the Dynamics of Inflation and its Control in South Asia. Further, ERD spearheaded the training of postgraduate aspirants of the Central Bank in the fields of macroeconomics, microeconomics, and mathematics for economics. The Central Bank’s official research publication, Staff Studies, was published in 2022 under the guidance of the RAC, while members of RAC continued to evaluate research proposals and research papers of the postgraduate aspirants of the Central Bank and provided supervisory services to some postgraduate students in the university system. Moreover, RAC members reviewed articles written to be published in the

8. EMPLOYEES’ PROVIDENT FUND

The Employees’ Provident Fund Department (EPF Department) facilitates the Monetary Board to exercise its powers, perform its duties and discharge its functions as per the provisions of the Employees’ Provident Fund Act (EPF Act), No.15 of 1958, which established the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF/Fund). In terms of the provisions of the EPF Act, the general administration of the Fund is vested with the Commissioner of Labour, while all the powers, duties and responsibilities of the fund management are vested with the Monetary Board of the Central Bank as the custodian of the Fund.

The EPF Department, on behalf of the Monetary Board of the Central Bank, is responsible for receiving all sums paid under the EPF Act as contributions, surcharges and fees and the income from the investment of moneys, having custody of the moneys of the Fund, maintaining separate accounts in respect of each member of the Fund, paying the persons certified by the Commissioner of Labour the benefits to which those persons are entitled under the Act, investing moneys of the Fund which are not immediately required for the purposes stipulated in the Act, maintaining books of accounts relating to the Fund, preparation of financial statements of the Fund and transmitting a copy to the Minister in charge of Labour, and submission of the same to the Auditor General.

During 2022, the EPF Department continued to engage in the above activities as per the provisions of the EPF Act, while maintaining close collaboration with the Commissioner of Labour. A summary of activities carried out by the EPF Department during the year under review is given below.

(a) Receiving Contributions and Payment of Benefits to those Entitled

In 2022, total member contributions increased by 17.4 per cent to Rs. 194.6 billion from Rs. 165.7 billion recorded in 2021, while the total refunds made to the members and their legal heirs also increased to Rs. 163.0 billion which was a 37.9 per cent increase compared to Rs. 118.2 billion in 2021. Accordingly, the net contribution (after deducting the amount of refunds from contributions) in 2022 decreased to Rs. 31.6 billion compared to Rs. 47.5 billion recorded in 2021 (Table II-9).

(b) Maintaining the General Accounts of the Fund and the Member Accounts

The total value of the Fund increased by 9.3 per cent to Rs. 3,459.9 billion as at end 2022 compared to

(c) Investment Activities of the Fund

The decision-making function of the EPF fund management activities were carried out by the EPF Investment Committee (EIC), which meets on a daily basis to assess the cashflow position, market conditions, evaluate investment opportunities, and to take decisions on investments. The EPF Investment Oversight Committee (EIOC) oversees the investment activities and provides strategic and policy guidance in line with the Monetary Board approved Investment Policy and Guidelines. Further, transactions relating to investments of the Fund are informed to the senior management of the Central Bank on a daily and weekly basis while the Monetary Board is apprised of investments of the Fund and the portfolio position on a monthly basis, thereby strengthening the stringent monitoring process of investment activities.

During 2022, the investment activities of the Fund were carried out within an environment of heightened macroeconomic uncertainty with the Government announcing a standstill on external debt servicing of bilateral and commercial loans from 12th April 2022. The economy witnessed a sharp contraction, historically high inflation, sharp increase in interest rates, headwinds in the external sector, scarcity of essential items and social and political unrest. In line with the guidelines on Strategic Assets Allocation (SAA) of the Fund, the EPF Department invested a major portion of its funds in government securities. In view of substantial volatility observed in financial markets, EPF placed greater emphasis on investing in long term government securities. Moreover, in order to capitalise on increasing short term interest rates in the backdrop

of inflationary pressures which prevailed during second and third quarters, the EPF Department increased its investments in short term Treasury bills in 2022. In the backdrop of heightened volatility in the equity market, EPF took a more cautious approach to investment opportunities in the equity market. Investment opportunities in corporate debentures were limited due to adverse macroeconomic conditions, while the EPF Department was also conscious of the need to invest in corporates with better credit ratings to mitigate credit risk of the corporate debt portfolio of the Fund.

Accordingly, as at end 2022, the investment portfolio of Rs.3,466.5 billion consisted of 96.9 per cent in government securities, 2.3 per cent in equity, 0.7 per cent in corporate debentures, and the remaining 0.1 per cent in reverse repurchase agreements.

(d) Payment of Interest on Member Balances

EPF intends to pay a rate of interest to its members consistent with the past years.

(e) Provision of Member Services

(i) Issuing of Statements of Member Accounts

Statements of member accounts are distributed on a semiannual basis to active members through their employers registered with the Fund. Accordingly, the member account statements of the first half and second half of 2021 were distributed during 2022 (Table II-10).

(iii) Pre-Retirement Refund Scheme

The Pre-retirement refund scheme was introduced in terms of the provisions in EPF (Amendment) Act, No. 02 of 2012 and the subsequent procedures passed by the Parliament. Accordingly, members who have contributed to the Fund for more than 10 years and having an account balance of more than Rs. 300,000 are entitled to withdraw up to 30 per cent of the member balance in their accounts, subject to a maximum of Rs. 2 million, for the purposes of construction of a house or medical treatment, with effect from 2015. The said scheme is in high demand among the members of EPF. During 2022, Rs. 16.4 billion was released to 27,278 members under this scheme. Accordingly, under the said scheme, a total of Rs. 123.5 billion had been refunded to 224,335 members by the end of 2022.

(iv) E-Collection of EPF Contributions

The EPF Department introduced a mechanism to expand the existing e-collection method via its official website. It enables the employers to submit e-Returns through the EPF website and make payments online, by linking with a participating Licensed Commercial Bank via the ‘LankaPay Online Payment Platform (LPOPP)’ or by a cheque or as a direct debit. By end 2022, Bank of Ceylon, People’s Bank, Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC, Sampath Bank PLC, and Nations Trust Bank joined with the EPF Department to provide the respective facility. One of the key features of the above system is that it enables to update the member accounts within a day, upon a successful payment. Furthermore, this system enables employers to verify the accuracy of member details in the EPF database.

By end 2022, e-Return submission increased to 12,815 employers, covering approximately 90 percent of the active member accounts and approximately 91 percent of the total monthly EPF contributions. During the year, further awareness was created among employers on benefits of e-Returns while emphasising the importance of taking actions to rectify the issues with regard to discrepancies in

the member details in relation to e-Returns. This will ensure that contributions are credited to the relevant member accounts in a timely manner.

(v) Re-registration of EPF Members

Considering the importance of maintaining a unique member identification system, the EPF Department continued the re-registration process of its active members under their National Identity Card (NIC) numbers and full names mentioned in their NICs. The verification of accuracy of NIC details at the above re-registration process is facilitated through the access provided to the database at the Department of Registration of Persons (DRP) under the Memorandum of Understanding with DRP. Further, several initiatives were taken by the EPF Department in 2022 with the intention of expediting the process of re-registration.

During the year, 26,959 active members were re-registered and the total number of active members re-registered by end 2022 was 1,682,978.

(vi) Other Member Services

The Public Relations and Inquiries Counter of the EPF Department faced a challenging year in 2022 with the sociopolitical unrest. However, the EPF Department provided its services to 129,454 members/employers who visited the Department and attended to 63,365 and 14,114 member inquiries through telephone calls and emails, respectively, during the year. Further, the Department responded to 1,630 letters from members, employers, and other stakeholders.

In 2022, Record Amendment Division (RAD) of the EPF Department attended to approximately 89,210 EPF record amendments related to EPF member accounts. Accordingly, 83,537 Name / NIC amendments comprising 12,944 requests for name / NIC amendments received through regional offices and 5,673 account amendments were attended to by the EPF Department in 2022.

(f) Process Improvement and Capacity Development

The Process Improvement and Capacity Development Division (PICDD) continued its coordination with the Consultant appointed for facilitating the design and implementation of an integrated information technology solution for Accounting, Investment, Member Liability Management, and a consolidated database for the EPF Department. Accordingly, the study on the existing business practices and processes related to EPF activities was completed successfully during the year.

Following the above study, the Consultant completed the Business Process Review (BPR) of EPF Department. Further, the Gap Analysis report was also completed

emphasising industrial best practices and benchmarking to regional provident funds. Based on the BPR and Gap Analysis, the drafting of Functional Design of the processes of the EPF Department is in progress.

9. FACILITIES MANAGEMENT

The Facilities Management Department (FMD) facilitated delivery of logistics and other support services related to buildings and equipment etc. to the staff and stakeholders of the Central Bank with necessary state-of-the-art arrangements amidst many challenges due to adverse social and economic conditions that prevailed in the country during the period under review. Although, certain import restrictions in place owing to the current situation of the country were detrimental to such refurbishment initiatives to Central Bank properties, FMD adopted every possible measure to ensure a safe, efficient, and effective working environment for the users.

FMD continued the replacement of obsolete equipment, fixtures, fittings, and accessories in the Central Bank Head Office building to create a more conducive environment for external and internal users. Upgrading of the two decades old audio visual system at the John Exter International Conference Hall (JEICH) was completed during the period under review. FMD replaced some of the electromechanical systems which were identified as obsolete during the building health test under the retrofit project of the Central Bank and continued the replacement of rest of the identified systems during the period. Provision of additional spaces with required facilities considering the requests made by the departments of the Central Bank were completed expeditiously ensuring their smooth functioning.

In par with the energy conservation measures initiated by FMD, the traditional lamp fittings with higher energy consumption were replaced with LED lamps. In addition, thermal insulation pertaining to the chill water system at the Extension Building was replaced due to the deteriorated condition of the several decades old existing insulation materials. Further, as a measure of preserving the structural soundness and preventing water seepage of the Central Bank Head Office building, FMD initiated a procurement process pertaining to the water proofing of its rooftop.

Further, Private Automatic Branch Exchanges (PABX) were installed at the Regional Office Matale and Whiteaways Building located at Sir Baron Jayathilake Mawatha, Colombo 1, due to the importance of a modern communication system for effective delivery of intended services.

The urgent requirement of relocating the Employees Provident Fund Department (EPFD) as a result of transferring of the ownership of the Lloyd’s Building located at Sir Baron Jayathilake Mawatha, Colombo 1, to the Secretary to the Cabinet of Ministers was facilitated, enabling EPFD to move to the ground floor of the Whiteaways Building which was previously occupied by the Credit Information Bureau. Further,

necessary infrastructure arrangements are being made to the 2nd floor of the same building to complete the relocation of EPFD as early as possible.

FMD arranged special transport services by renting buses from the Sri Lanka Transport Board, facilitating employees of the Central Bank to report for work and return home during the transport disruptions that prevailed in the country. This was one of the major initiatives of FMD during the year under review which significantly contributed to the continuity of the operations of the Central Bank without any hindrance.

Further, FMD continued to facilitate the outsourcing of the services of drivers with vehicles to the Central Bank’s Regional Offices during the period. In addition, the existing vehicle fleet of FMD was further strengthened with required maintenance, servicing, and repairs. Moreover, FMD continued providing transport facilities for the staff of the Central Bank amidst the severe difficulties in obtaining fuel for its vehicles during the period in which fuel availability was limited in the market.

In view of enhancing the appearance and the life span of the security fence in front of the Central Bank Head Office necessary repairs and application of paint with special coating were carried out.

FMD continued its maintenance of the critical services of the buildings and necessary support services in transport and telecommunication as part of its key responsibilities.

11. FINANCIAL CONSUMER RELATIONS

The Financial Consumer Relations Department (FCRD) was established in August 2020 with a view to strengthen the financial consumer protection framework within the financial entities regulated by the Central Bank to promote the rights and interests of financial consumers and ensure fairness and transparency of financial products and services offered to financial consumers.

In 2022, FCRD functioned as the single point of contact for financial consumers of the entities regulated by the Central Bank to send their complaints and grievances on delivery of services or business conduct of such entities. During the year the department handled a total of 5,149 complaints and grievances, averaging to around 430 complaints per month. The main categories of the complaints/ grievances received were on requests for concessions on the financing facilities obtained from such entities, charging of high-interest rates, matters related to moratoria, non-provision of information/ documents by financial institutions on consumer requests, and charging of high fees and commissions. Around 75 per cent of complaints received by the department during 2022 were completed/ resolved within two months from the date of receipt of such complaints, even after allowing a reasonable period of time for the respective financial institutions to submit their responses to the complaints made.

As a part of its activities, FCRD oversees the Contact Centre operations of the Central Bank. During 2022, the Contact Centre answered more than 60,000 telephone inquiries and verbal complaints received by the Central Bank. Furthermore, as part of its campaign for creating consumer awareness, FCRD published a web poster on the Central Bank website explaining financial consumers about the avenues available and steps to be taken by them when seeking assistance from FCRD/ the Central Bank. In addition, the department also conducted several seminars and programs on financial consumer protection at the national and regional levels to reach a wider audience. FCRD, with the assistance of the International Finance Corporation, through a professional advertising firm, is developing a media campaign focusing on financial consumer awareness, to be launched in early 2023.

Furthermore, with a view of institutionalising consumer protection in the delivery of services/ conduct of businesses by financial institutions, a comprehensive set of new regulations was developed, enabling the introduction of an integrated financial consumer protection framework for entities regulated by the Central Bank. These regulations will define specific regulatory powers for supervisors to facilitate market conduct supervision while providing clarity to both service providers and recipients on the areas to be considered in delivering or obtaining financial services aimed at minimising the need for financial consumers to make subsequent complaints. The draft of the Regulations has been made available to the industry and public for stakeholder consultation and the final regulations will be issued in mid-2023.

12. FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE UNIT

The Financial Intelligence Unit of Sri Lanka (FIU) was established in March 2006 with the objective of facilitating prevention of Money Laundering (ML) and countering Terrorist Financing (TF). Accordingly, FIU is responsible for facilitating and coordinating the establishment of an effective Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework in the country, primarily based on three main pieces of legislation, namely, the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act No. 25 of 2005 (CSTFA), Prevention of Money Laundering Act No. 5 of 2006 (PMLA), and Financial Transactions Reporting Act No. 6 of 2006 (FTRA).

12.1 Receiving, Analysing, and Disseminating Financial Intelligence

As per Section 15 of the FTRA, FIU performed its key role of receiving, analysing, and disseminating information on suspicious financial transactions relating to Money Laundering/ Terrorist Financing (ML/TF) and other unlawful activities during 2022. Further, Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs), Licensed Specialised Banks (LSBs), Licensed Finance Companies (LFCs), insurance companies, stock brokers, and money or value transfer service providers continued to report cash transactions and Electronic Funds Transfers (EFTs) above Rs. 1 million, or its equivalent in foreign currencies, both domestic and international to FIU. During 2022, Reporting Institutions (RIs) reported 7.6 million (provisional) cash transactions and 10.8 million (provisional) EFTs (inwards and outwards) to FIU through the ‘LankaFin’ reporting system as well as the newly introduced ‘goAML’ reporting system. With effect from 01st January 2023, FIU discontinued the ‘LankaFin’ system for LCBs and LSBs for all types of reporting.

Furthermore, RIs submitted 1,481 Suspicious Transactions Reports (STRs) to FIU as per Section 7 of the FTRA. After analysing the STRs received, 419 STRs were disseminated to Law Enforcement Authorities (LEAs) and Regulatory Authorities (RAs) for further investigations. FIU kept 605 STRs under surveillance and 453 STRs for further studies and analysis. The remaining STRs were categorised as no further action required.

12.2 Legal Framework and Institutional Framework

During the year 2022, FIU took various actions to bring legislative amendments to the legal framework on AML/CFT with the objective of improving the effectiveness of the AML/CFT regime of the country in compliance with international AML/CFT standards. These amendments are expected to be finalised during 2023.

By virtue of the powers vested in terms of Section 15 (2) of the FTRA, during the year 2022, FIU took measures to suspend transactions of 136 accounts belonging to 38 individuals and 5 entities pertaining to 14 incidents/cases, based on the suspicions of ML/TF. Accordingly, a balance of

Part II

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 97

Rs. 96 million was suspended during the year. In addition, around 1,000 accounts relating to 78 cases, which were suspended in the previous years, were extended in two month intervals during the year as LEAs requested further time to conduct investigations. In order to strengthen the AML/CFT compliance of RIs, FIU issued 4 Circulars during 2022, which can be referenced in Part III of this Report.

Further, FIU took continuous measures to enhance compliance of FIs and Designated Non-Finance Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs) by effective monitoring and enforcement, onsite and offsite surveillance, and conducting compliance review meetings. Accordingly, in 2022, FIU conducted 22 joint risk based examinations, 3 risk based onsite examinations, and 22 spot examinations of FIs. In addition, 17 risk based onsite examinations were conducted on DNFBPs. Apart from the above examinations, 5 thematic reviews were also conducted on FIs and DNFBPs.

Based on the onsite examinations conducted in 2022, financial penalties amounting to Rs. 11.75 million were imposed on 6 Licensed Banks on violations of the FTRA and CDD Rules. Also, 8 show cause letters and 9 warning letters were issued during the year to FIs on instances of non-compliance with the provisions of the FTRA and the CDD Rules and Regulations issued there under. Moreover, FIU took measures to inform identified deficiencies to 17 DNFBP institutions during 2022. The AML/CFT supervision of DNFBPs was further strengthened by implementing continuous measures to enhance the number of DNFBP institutions for AML/CFT compliance.

12.3 Strengthening the Domestic Coordination and International Cooperation on AML/CFT Related Matters

The FTRA empowers FIU to enter into Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) to exchange information with any institution or agency domestically or in a foreign state. During 2022, FIU initiated signing MOUs with the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Kingdom of Lesotho, the Unidade de Informação Financeira de Timor-Leste (FIU of Timor-Leste) and the Financial Intelligence Authority of Uganda.

The Annual Plenary of the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG), the regional monitoring body of the Financial Action Task Force was held as a hybrid plenary in July 2022, and the officers of FIU participated in the plenary meetings virtually. Further, the officers of FIU participated in several virtual Mutual Evaluation Committee (MEC) meetings held during the year, mainly to discuss the members’ Mutual Evaluation Reports and Follow-Up Reports (FURs). The 7th FUR of Sri Lanka was endorsed at the virtual MEC held in July 2022, where Sri Lanka did not request for upgrades to any recommendation. Accordingly, by the end of 2022, out of 40 Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, Sri Lanka’s compliance status stood as 7 Compliant, 25 Largely Compliant, 7 Partially Compliant and 1 Non-Compliant. During the Plenary,

FIU Sri Lanka was elected as the South Asia Sub-Regional representative of the APG Governance Committee for a one year period.

FIU obtains assistance from members of the Egmont Group, i.e., the Association of global FIUs consisting of 166 members, through the Egmont Secure Web to carry out investigations and to collaborate with member countries to gather intelligence on their investigations. During 2022, FIU responded to 27 requests from counterpart FIUs and made 35 requests to counterpart FIUs to share information related to ongoing investigations. The Egmont Plenary for 2022 was held as an in-person meeting. However, the officials of FIU were unable to participate in the plenary meetings due to external circumstances.

12.4 National Risk Assessment (NRA) on Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing

FIU continued the conduct of National Risk Assessment (NRA) on ML/TF with technical assistance from the World Bank, in compliance with Recommendation 1 of the FATF Recommendations. The outcome of the NRA is expected to be published in the first half of 2023 and the next National AML/CFT Policy will be formulated in line with the NRA outcome.

12.5 Conducting Awareness Programs for Stakeholders

Continuing the efforts to enhance the awareness on AML/CFT, FIU organised and provided resource assistance for altogether 24 awareness/training programs during the year 2022, accommodating nearly 2,250 participants from FIs, DNFBPs, LEAs, and RAs. These programs were conducted face-to-face as well as through online platforms.

13. FOREIGN EXCHANGE

The Department of Foreign Exchange (DFE), which was established on 20 November 2017, continued to carry out the responsibility vested in the Central Bank as the agent of the Government for implementing the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Act No. 12 of 2017 (FEA) to ensure proper promotion and regulation of foreign exchange in Sri Lanka.

(c) Transfer of Migrants’ funds

ADs were permitted to open 215 Capital Transaction Rupee Accounts (CTRAs) during the year for the purpose of remitting the migration allowance to Sri Lankan emigrants and to facilitate outward remittances of inherited funds to non-nationals. However, the amounts transferred through these CTRAs amounted to only USD 1.26 million due to suspensions introduced under the Order issued under Section 22 of the FEA.

13.3 Issuing Clearance Letters to Resident Investors

DFE issued 12 clearance letters during the year to resident investors confirming that there are no pending investigations under the FEA against such investors, thus enabling them to make outward investments as permitted by the Regulations issued by the Minister.

13.4 Monitoring and Investigation of Foreign Exchange Transactions

i. All ADs are required to submit the information on foreign currency accounts maintained by them to DFE as per the reporting requirements imposed by the Directions issued under the FEA on such foreign currency accounts. Further, in terms of the Repatriation of Export Proceeds into Sri Lanka Rules No. 1 of 2022, as amended (Rules), issued under the MLA, all ADs are required to submit information in relation to repatriation of export proceeds into Sri Lanka and conversion of such proceeds into Sri Lanka Rupees as stipulated. This information is analysed by DFE and used for monitoring, regulatory and policy making purposes.

ii. In addition, DFE conducted several on-site inspections at ADs to identify whether the ADs and exporters complied with the Rules and to initiate remedial measures or regulatory action, if necessary.

iii. 47 new investigations were initiated in respect of ADs, RDs and other persons in terms of the provisions of the FEA, with regard to non-compliances with the Regulations, Directions, and Orders issued under the FEA.

iv. Further, 40 investigations, which comprise 17 initiated before 2022 and 23 initiated during 2022, were concluded during the year by taking appropriate actions.

v. Additionally, law enforcement authorities were assisted in litigation and judicial proceedings by providing expert evidence/testimonies by the DFE in respect of matters pertaining to the provisions of the FEA.

13.5 Export Proceeds Monitoring System (EPMS)

In 2021, a Working Group was appointed to implement an IT based system to monitor export proceeds repatriations into the country. As a result, an automated EPMS was developed and implemented in June 2022, in collaboration with the Information Technology Department of the Central Bank and the Sri Lanka Customs (SLC). The main objective of the EPMS is to ensure all exports of goods from the country are captured into a database and to monitor the repatriation of export proceeds as per the Rules on Repatriation of Export Proceeds into Sri Lanka. The EPMS captures export information through a web service provided by SLC and export proceeds repatriation details are submitted by ADs to the system. Accordingly, the EPMS is expected to strength the monitoring of export proceeds repatriation into the country.

14. FOREIGN REMITTANCES FACILITATION

The Foreign Remittances Facilitation Department (FRFD) was established to facilitate and streamline workers’ remittance inflows to the country while working towards realising the full potential of labour migration and workers’ remittances. In achieving set goals, the FRFD engaged in the following activities during 2022 and early 2023 by liaising with other relevant authorities in the foreign remittance sector.

14.1 Cash Based and Non-cash Based Incentives for Migrant Workers

a) Implemented an incentive scheme for reimbursing transaction costs borne by migrant workers up to Rs. 1,000 per transaction equivalent to Rs. 20,000 or above when remitting money to rupee accounts maintained by licensed banks and over the counter cash receipts. In this regard, FRFD held discussions with the State Bank of Pakistan, Migrant Workers Associations abroad, Exchange House Associations abroad and licensed banks in Sri Lanka prior to designing and implementing the scheme. This scheme has been in operation since 01 February 2022.

b) Designed a scheme to introduce an additional duty-free allowance for migrant workers. This scheme would

encourage migrant workers to send their earnings through formal channels, facilitating sustainability and medium term growth of the non-debt forex inflows to the country. The scheme was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers and is expected to be implemented in the near future.

c) Involved in designing a scheme to grant permission to import Electric Vehicles for Migrant Workers. The scheme was implemented by the Ministry of Labour and Foreign Employment. The scheme encourages migrant workers to remit their forex earnings through legal channels by granting them permission to import electric vehicles of Cost, Insurance, and Freight (CIF) values equal to or less than the 50 per cent of the forex remitted from 01 May to 31 December 2022.

14.2 Public Awareness on Workers’ Remittances and Migration

a) Public awareness programmes on incentives schemes focused on migrant workers and the importance of formal money transferring channels were conducted through various modes, such as newspapers, radio programmes, seminars, social media platforms and news websites.

b) A list of Remitting Agents (RAs) and Other Remitting Channels (ORCs) directly tied up with licensed banks in Sri Lanka was published on the Central Bank website and updated on a regular basis. This list is to improve the awareness of Sri Lankan expatriates on RAs and ORCs directly tied up with licensed banks, enabling them to identify the formal channels for sending their remittances to Sri Lanka.

c) FRFD engaged in handling clarifications, complaints, and grievances in relation to remitting foreign currency to the country while addressing the difficulties and limitations faced by migrant workers by liaising with relevant authorities and other departments of the Central Bank.

14.3 Sharing Information on Remittances and Migration

a) Disseminated data on labour migration and workers’ remittances by publishing the respective information on the Central Bank website.

b) Conducted research on workers’ remittances and migration and published them in Journals and Central Bank publications.

In order to address the information asymmetries on methods used by migrant workers to remit their earnings to Sri Lanka and to provide the required information for effective policy formulation, currently FRFD is conducting a baseline survey on Sri Lankan migrant workers and their remittance patterns by carrying out face-to-face interviews based on a structured questionnaire. Going forward, FRFD expects to get extensively involved in the process of introducing new

schemes such as concessionary loan schemes to enhance remittances and migrant workers’ welfare in collaboration with other relevant authorities. Further, FRFD is planning to study the transaction cost currently prevailing in the market by using a Cross Country Study on inward remittance flows.

15. HUMAN RESOURCES

The Human Resources Department (HRD) carries out the Human Resource Management (HRM) functions with the objective of ensuring the availability of a productive, motivated, and contented team of employees, who could contribute to achieve the overall objectives of the Central Bank amidst various challenges such as the COVID-19 outbreak, traveling difficulties due to fuel shortages, etc. In line with Strategic Action Plan 2022 of the Central Bank, operations of HRD included activities related to recruitment of new staff, promotions, job rotations, employee remunerations, training and skills development, performance evaluation, staff motivation, grievances handling, and outsourcing of selected services of the Central Bank as necessary, during the year 2022.

Further, HRD convened regular meetings of the Heads of Department for discussions and decision making on operational as well as policy matters related to the Central Bank’s core activities and, strategic and operational functions.

HRD contributed towards maintaining the industrial harmony in the Central Bank by facilitating continuous dialogue between the Central Bank management, employees at all levels as well as the Trade Unions.

Under the performance evaluation process, the level of performance of each employee is evaluated by assigning ratings for the performance achieved, generic and technical competencies as specified in the evaluation criteria. The final performance marks of employees up to SC Gr III (2) are used as one of the requirements in the promotion criteria.

HRD carried out the employee performance evaluation process as planned during the year. Further, HRD introduced a quarterly performance review process from 2022. This process is aimed at giving an opportunity for the supervisors to closely monitor the performance of employees in a progressive manner, aligning employees’ performance towards achieving departmental strategic objectives, and for employees, to use as a direction to achieve their annual individual goals.

(c) Promotions

HRD facilitated promotions under the employee promotion scheme of the Central Bank to ensure carrier progression of employees.

(d) Training and Skills Development

The Central Bank provides opportunities for its staff to upgrade skills and knowledge for the purpose of fulfilling the objectives of the Central Bank effectively and to have a diverse and talented staff. Accordingly, the Central Bank encourages its officers to read for postgraduate studies in internationally recognised universities under the Central Bank Sponsorship Scheme for postgraduate studies. Further, the Central Bank facilitates officers to attend training programs locally and internationally, to support the continuous enhancement of knowledge,

expertise, and skills within the Central Bank and to meet the emerging needs of its human capital development. However, considering the prevailing economic condition of the country, the Central Bank decided not to bear any foreign currency expenses on facilitating training opportunities including postgraduate studies during the year 2022. However, the Central Bank allowed officers to participate in foreign trainings for which the total costs were sponsored by the organising institution and to proceed for postgraduate studies if the officer obtained a full scholarship from external sources acceptable to the Central Bank.

In 2022, HRD facilitated two officers to embark on postgraduate studies in economics in top ranked universities in Australia under scholarships offered by the Australian Government. The number of officers who commenced and returned after completion of postgraduate studies under the Central Bank Sponsorship Scheme during the period from the year 2018 to end of the year 2022 are given in Table II-16 below.

As an alternative to the above, the Central Bank facilitated officers to attend online training programs in 2022 conducted by the other Central Banks and international organisations such as IMF, SEACEN, World Bank etc., and local institutions. Accordingly, HRD facilitated 621 officers to participate in 402 foreign training programs conducted virtually and 65 officers to participate in 36 foreign training programs held abroad which were fully funded by the training organiser.

In the meantime, HRD facilitated 479 officers to participate in 93 local training programs conducted by the external local training institutions and 1,716 officers to participate in 85 local training programs conducted by the Central Bank’s Centre for Banking Studies (CBS). In addition, HRD facilitated the Central Bank employees to follow long term local (part time) training programs and continued its Sponsorship Scheme for the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) qualification, while facilitating other Certificate

resilience; and (e) IT helpdesk support and enhancement of competencies of the staff.

(a) Delivery of Cost-effective Application Software Solutions

ITD developed an Export Proceeds Monitoring System (EPMS) to facilitate the Department of Foreign Exchange (DFE) to monitor the repatriation of export proceeds and conversion of such export proceeds into Sri Lanka Rupees. EPMS captures data related to export of goods from Sri Lanka Customs on a daily basis and matches with data provided by the Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) on repatriation of export proceeds from the same, on a weekly basis. Further, the system captures data related to repatriation of proceeds for export of services reported by LCBs. The system compiles data and generates required reports to facilitate DFE implementing well informed and data driven regulatory measures.

ITD further enhanced the International Transaction Reporting System (ITRS) developed for the collection of granular data on cross border foreign currency transactions of customers of LCBs and Licensed Specialised Banks (LSBs), by introducing new features to improve continuous monitoring and cleansing of data. In addition, dashboards to analyse cross border transaction data were developed to enhance the operational and policy decision making process of the Central Bank. Furthermore, ITD continued to provide technical assistance to LCBs and LSBs to ensure smooth functioning of the ITRS.

To strengthen the continuous supervision and examination process of financial institutions, the FinNet system (the regulatory data collection system from LCBs, LSBs and Licensed Finance Companies) was further enhanced enabling reporting of financial information in line with Sri Lanka Financial Reporting Standards (SLFRS-9).

A Depositor Wise Data Collection System was implemented for the Resolution and Enforcement Department (RED) to collect data from all banks and finance companies at regular time intervals. This system consists of three modules: the Deposit Data Validator tool which enables the financial institutions to validate and submit the required information to the Central Bank, the web interface for the RED to get summarised information of the submitted data, and the module for submission of regulatory returns at regular time intervals through the FinNet.

ITD further facilitated the automation of several manual operations of the Employees’ Provident Fund Department (EPFD). Reconciliation of employer payments made through online channels as well as through respective bank counters, checking trial balance relevant to the refund payments before

releasing such payments, processing payments made via respective banks, and issuing e-documents for visa purposes were some of the manual processes which were automated during the year.

The currency counter function of the Currency Department (CRD) was fully integrated to the Currency Management System (CMS) along with all required reports, reducing the usage of paper. Further, a new Counterfeit Notes Identification System was developed for the CRD. This system records all information provided by the Central Bank to court cases, enabling easy reference for future court cases.

ITD progressed with the development of a system to manage Refinance, Interest Subsidy and Credit Guarantee scheme loan facilities granted by Regional Development Department (RDD) through banks to micro, small and medium sector enterprises. This system is expected to streamline loan processing, increase productivity and efficiency, while reducing manual work. The Refinance module of the above system was implemented and is in live operation while development of the other modules is in progress.

The Treasury Bond Auction System was modified to facilitate the implementation of a Direct Issuance Window by the Public Debt Department (PDD) for Treasury Bonds that are fully allocated at Phase I, accommodating the funding requirements of the Treasury.

An Inventory Management System for IT Fixed Assets was implemented to manage the lifecycle of IT assets within the Central Bank in an efficient and effective manner.

To increase the efficiency of staff loan processing carried out by the Staff Services Management Department (SSMD), ITD developed a new and improved web based loan granting system for the Staff Benefit Scheme (SBS) while initiating the development of a new and improved system for Staff Housing Loans (SHL).

The Task Tracker system that automates internal workflows was revamped to include a new workflow that follows up recommendations from the Audit Advisory Committee (AAC).

In addition to the completed projects mentioned above, ITD initiated and progressed with several other new systems and enhancements vital for the operations of the Central Bank.

In order to comply with the SWIFT roadmap for ISO 20022 SWIFT MX migration, conversion of existing SWIFT MT message formats to ISO 20022 MX message formats was successfully tested for outward messages of iGLAS, the Central Bank’s General Ledger System.

ITD catered to special data requirements of departments of the Central Bank and facilitated audits carried out on software systems and related processes.

Further, ITD continued to expand the use of the Document Management System (DMS) by completing physical document digitisation processes in several departments, increasing personnel productivity related to document handling.

(b) Continuous Enhancement of IT Infrastructure

IT infrastructure of the Central Bank was maintained during the year to ensure all information systems are resilient and on par with latest technology advancements.

ITD completed the construction of the new Head Office Data Centre to comply with the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) 942 Rated-3 standard. This is a data centre which has redundant capacity components and multiple independent distribution paths serving the computer equipment.

Along with the above new data centre, ITD designed and planned to upgrade the Local Area Network (LAN) of the head office building by widening the backbone bandwidth through high speed fibre and Gigabit Ethernet up to the end user.

(c) Contribution to the Establishment of State-of-the-art Financial Market Infrastructure

Technical expertise was provided by ITD to several national level IT projects during the year.

ITD contributed to the national payments and settlements system modernisation project through active involvement in the scoping, designing, and testing phases of system implementation.

(d) Strengthening IT Security and Resilience

ITD took measures to secure all IT assets of the Central Bank, while facilitating a secure Work from Home (WFH) environment for employees on a needs basis. The Information Security Policy which is the key document on implementing information security of the Central Bank was updated with the inclusion of a WFH policy and a laptop usage policy.

In addition to frequent vulnerability assessments performed internally on software applications, an assessment was also performed on the financial messaging network related IT infrastructure to ensure that the systems are well prepared for any cyber security threat. An external information security assessment was also carried out targeting the financial messaging network and other mission critical systems to ensure a high level of security.

Virtual user awareness programs were carried out to provide employees of the Central Bank with knowledge

and guidance on newly introduced security policies, data classification, and data backup methods. Phishing simulations were carried out to enhance user awareness of identifying phishing emails.

(e) IT Support and Enhancement of Competencies of the Staff

WFH arrangements were supported by ITD in order to continue daily operations of the Central Bank, while ensuring secure access to systems, adopting industry best practices. ITD was able to simultaneously provide assistance to all help desk queries and maintain a high level of availability of critical infrastructure (above 99.5%), on par with the industry standards, amidst diverse challenges.

In order to uplift the IT competencies of the staff and to nurture a more technologically savvy and threat ready workforce within the Central Bank, ITD continued to publish awareness banners on the intranet and circulated security advisory alerts through email to all staff.

In addition, the staff of ITD actively participated in local and international webinars, virtual workshops, and conferences to enhance their skills and knowledge on IT advancements required to uplift the quality of IT systems and related infrastructure of the Central Bank.

17. INTERNAL AUDIT

The Internal Audit function has been in operation in the Central Bank since 1951. The purpose and mission, scope of work, authority, responsibility, independence, and objectivity of the Internal Audit Department (IAD) are included in the Internal Audit Charter approved by the Monetary Board. IAD follows the International Professional Practices Framework of the Institute of Internal Auditors (IPPF of IIA) in conducting audits. A summary of the activities carried out by the department during 2022 is given below.

17.1 Internal Audit Plans

Strategic Audit Plan for 2023–2026 and the Annual Audit Plan for 2023 were compiled during the year and approved by the Monetary Board at the end of December 2022.

17.2 Conduct of Audit Assignments

(a) Process Audits and Information Systems Audits

In 2022, Process and Information Systems (IS) audits were conducted. Each audit engagement was carried out in four sequential steps, i.e., planning, performing, communicating audit results, and following up on the implementation of audit recommendations. 47 Audit Reports were issued and accordingly, audit observations with recommendations were communicated to the relevant departments during the year, covering the policy, compliance, operational, legal, and other related risk areas.

Audit reports were submitted to the Superintendent of National Audit Office through the AAC. Further, contents of the Internal Audit Reports were submitted to Director General of the Management Audit Department of the Ministry of Finance as requested and in line with the National Audit Act, No. 19 of 2018.

17.3 Quality Assessment and Improvement Program

During the year, ongoing monitoring of the performance and periodic self-assessment of internal audit activity were conducted and the results were communicated to the Monetary Board through the AAC.

17.4 Capacity Building and Awareness

Capacity building programs for the officers of IAD were conducted in different related disciplines during the year. Further, IAD conducted an awareness program for the Audit Coordinating Officers of the Bank on the “Internal Audit Facilitation Guidelines” in the first quarter of 2022. A guest presentation was conducted by an IS audit professional for the benefit of IAD staff.

17.5 Facilitation to the Monetary Board Advisory Audit Committee

The AAC is a subcommittee of the Monetary Board which advises the Monetary Board on financial reporting, internal controls, internal audit, external audit, and any other matters assigned by the Monetary Board. The Secretary to the Monetary Board is the Secretary to the AAC. The Director of IAD functions as the Assistant Secretary to the AAC where IAD provides secretarial facilitation to the AAC. Further, follow up of the implementation of the AAC recommendations was also carried out periodically during the year.

18. INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

The International Operations Department (IOD) is entrusted with the responsibility of managing official foreign reserves and monitoring the domestic foreign exchange (FX) market activities to ensure the orderly and smooth operations of the domestic FX market, as empowered by the provisions of the Monetary Law Act (MLA), No. 58 of 1949.

18.1 International Reserves Management

Foreign reserves management activities of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka are carried-out by IOD, as per the Investment Policy Statement and the Investment Guidelines prepared under the broader guidance of the International Reserves Investment Oversight Committee (IRIOC) and approved by the Monetary Board. Since 2016, a model based scientific framework stemming from the asset and liability structure

was followed by the Central Bank in managing its foreign reserves, where the model has been built up considering liquidity requirements, capital preservation, and income generation objectives subject to the risk tolerance level of the Central Bank.

Year 2022 marked the most inordinately challenging year in the history, where the standard reserve management operations were restrained and IOD was compelled to adopt a pathway with time and context specific approaches. The unprecedented foreign exchange liquidity crisis emerged in 2020 led the traditional reserve management objectives turn to a different dimension since mid-2021, amidst several stressed scenarios becoming simple realities on the global front. Sri Lanka also confronted with severe challenges with the acute shortage of foreign currency liquidity being the most prominent issue.

This FX liquidity shortage become extremely chaotic with severe shortages in essential needs, primarily fuel, cooking gas and coal since 2021, and the situation aggravated to an unprecedented level by end of the first quarter of 2022. This warranted, the Central Bank to deploy various crisis specific measures in combating the FX crisis, and had to optimally allocate the scarcely available foreign reserves in meeting the pressing FX needs for essentials to maintain economic activities of the country at least at bare minimum levels. Whilst there was enormous pressure and overwhelming public outcry rising up for necessities, demand management of foreign currency with an extremely limited and fast diminishing foreign reserves was indisputably a daunting task for the reserve management team of the Central Bank, and the focus was purely on liquidity management. With the announcement of debt restructuring initiatives in April 2022, the FX debt service was limited to the settlement of debts to multilateral organisations.

Nevertheless, the Central Bank had to adopt time and context specific measures, deviating from the standard reserve management practices. As a result, a gradual easing down in the intense demand for foreign currency was observed with a noticeable improvement in the foreign currency liquidity in the domestic market, towards the very end of the year.

18.2 Performance Analysis and Facilitation Activities

As usual, IOD compiled Central Bank reserves and gross official reserves on a daily basis, while assessing the performance of reserve management activities on a realised return approach despite the sharp decline in foreign reserve levels. As required, the performance of reserves management was presented to the IRIOC and the Monetary Board, on a monthly and quarterly basis, respectively, where the constraints on reserve management were deliberated.

With a view to provide a buffer even with short-term FX liquidity until a buildup of official reserves is in place, the external funding arrangements were done through the

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2022

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 110

Part II

Bilateral Currency Swap Agreements (BCSAs) with fellow Central Bank fraternity, namely, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Bangladesh Bank (BB), and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC). The second drawal of the RBI SARRC swap facility was executed in January 2022, while the swap facility obtained from the BB in August/September 2021, which was initially rolled-over twice, was rolled-over further in 2022. The swap facility obtained from the PBoC was also rolled-over for a further period of twelve months.

Meanwhile, the annual review to evaluate the adherence/compliance with Anti Money Laundering / Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) requirements of foreign counterparties was carried-out for existing active counterparties in 2022, despite the extremely challenging global and local FX market conditions.

In 2022, the Central Bank implemented a new Reserve Management System (RMS) upon the expiration of the license of the Treasury Management System (TMS). As the main user of the RMS, IOD is vested with the responsibility of system administration function of the RMS, while ensuring proper coordination with other user departments and the software provider.

18.3 Domestic Foreign Exchange Market Developments

IOD actively engaged in monitoring and guiding the domestic FX market, which faced an acute liquidity shortage during the year. As per the guidance provided by the Central Bank in September 2021, the USD/LKR rupee exchange rate ranged between Rs. 200 and Rs. 203 until early March 2022. However, subsequent to the Central Bank’s decision to allow a measured adjustment in the exchange rate on 07 March 2022 due to the sharp depletion of gross official reserves of the country and the significant pressures in the domestic FX market, the USD/LKR exchange rate started to overshoot. As a measure in managing the intraday volatility of the exchange rate, amidst the challenging liquidity position and the absence of an active interbank FX market, the Central Bank commenced announcing exchange rate guidance with a variation margin since 13 May 2022. Consequently, the exchange rate stabilised gradually, and the weighted average spot exchange rate in the interbank FX market hovered between Rs. 360 - Rs. 363 per US dollar during the period from mid May to end December 2022. Since mid May 2022, IOD commenced publishing the USD/LKR middle spot exchange rate with a prescribed variation margin along with middle exchange rates for 56 other world currencies, on the Central Bank website, on a daily basis. In addition, the average Telegraphic Transfer (TT) buying and selling exchange rates against the Sri Lankan rupee for nine major currencies were also published on the Central Bank website on a daily basis.

During 2022, the Central Bank continued to purchase a portion of mandatorily converted export proceeds in

goods, converted workers’ remittances, and converted service export proceeds from Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) and National Savings Bank (NSB). In addition, LCBs and NSB voluntarily surrendered another portion of such proceeds to finance the importation of coal and fuel. Moreover, in order to address FX liquidity issues in the domestic FX market, the Central Bank was compelled to implement several new measures, such as availing its FX in financing an extended range of essential imports, while instructing all banks to prioritise essential imports and encouraging them to manage FX outflows with the available FX inflows. A remarkable feature of the domestic FX market activities was the Central Bank’s presence as a net seller, facilitating a significant number of requests for foreign exchange essentials such as fuel, gas, coal, pharmaceuticals and food commodities, among several others, due to the national importance of such requests in maintaining economic activities amidst public unrest. In this endeavour, IOD had to extensively engage with different stakeholders, including the Government, State Owned Business Enterprises, private sector players, and customers, devoting a considerable time to address their queries/concerns.

Meanwhile, to ensure a high standard of market conduct whilst preventing excessive volatility of the exchange rate and avoiding building up FX positions, IOD took measures to temporarily revise the Net Foreign Exchange Open Position (NOP) limits applicable to respective LCBs/NSB on a case-by-case basis in 2022, to facilitate smooth functioning of the domestic FX market. In line with market sentiments, IOD, as per its entrusted responsibility of ensuring the orderly conduct of the domestic FX market, provided its own recommendations to curb undue volatility in the exchange rate, while continuing to provide its views, observations, and recommendations on possible implications of various policy proposals and regulations, related to matters forwarded by other departments of the Central Bank as well as external organisations throughout the year.

IOD continued to be the Secretariat of the Market Operations Committee (MOC) and provided the same with all relevant information to make effective recommendations. IOD also provided its insights on the developments in terms of the domestic FX market and gross official reserves to the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). Further, the Monetary Board was continuously apprised and provided appropriate recommendations, highlighting concerns and the way forward on the developments in the domestic FX market in a timely manner.

Meanwhile, IOD continued to provide its contributions and inputs to the Capital Market Development Project (CMP), which is to be implemented by the Central Bank, aimed at developing the domestic FX market and improving the market monitoring activities.

19. LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE

Legal Department (LD) actively contributed to achieving all strategic priorities of the Central Bank despite the challenging environment caused by the macroeconomic turmoil in the country. Some of the key activities performed by LD during the year 2022 are summarised below.

With the assistance of various stakeholders including the Ministry of Finance, Attorney General’s Department, Legal Draftsman’s Department, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank, LD engaged in the enactment of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act, which was published in the Gazette on 01.11.2019, which was also a prior action of the IMF program. The said Bill has been further developed to capture new areas in central banking in association with such stakeholders. The Bill inter alia provides for the autonomy of the Central Bank with enhanced governance standards, an advanced Board structure to secure the objects thereof, and enhanced regulatory and supervisory powers, etc. It will replace the Monetary Law Act, No. 58 of 1949 once enacted.

In addition, during 2022, LD engaged in the drafting of a few other new laws which enhance the authority of the Central Bank in several regulatory arenas. The said new laws include the Trading, Clearing and Netting Act, the Banking (Special Provisions) Act, and Microfinance and Credit Regulatory Authority Act to enhance the regulatory, supervisory, and resolution framework of the Central Bank. Further, LD acted in collaboration with other supervisory departments to introduce further amendments to the Finance Business Act, No. 42 of 2011, Finance Leasing Act, No. 56 of 2000, Foreign Exchange Act, No. 12 of 2017, and Payment and Settlement Systems Act, No. 28 of 2005 with a view to enhancing the regulatory and supervisory authority of the Central Bank in order to address various challenges arising from market developments in the country.

During 2022, there was a considerable increase in litigation filed against the Central Bank pursuant to the economic downturn of the country, and LD, with the assistance of the relevant departments made submissions to secure the interests of the Bank. In collaboration with law enforcement authorities of the country, LD continued to institute action against unauthorised finance companies, prohibited schemes, and instituted actions to wind up finance companies of which licenses were cancelled by the Monetary Board, with a view to safeguarding the interests of the depositors and creditors of such entities.

LD actively collaborated with the other departments of the Central Bank in developing and amending subsidiary legislations issued by the Monetary Board under the statutes administered by the Central Bank, with a view to enhancing its regulatory authority and thereby, ensuring the soundness of the banking and financial sector. LD also reviewed the statutes developed outside the Central Bank by giving observations to

the provisions thereof, including the Personal Data Protection Act No. 09 of 2022 and Colombo Port City Economic Commission Act, No. 11 of 2021.

Moreover, in 2022, LD handled the compliance function of the Central Bank to facilitate compliance requirements of foreign counterparties, conducting annual counterparty reviews from an anti-money laundering perspective. In order to ensure the Central Bank’s compliance with provisions of the Right to Information Act, No. 12 of 2016 (RTI Act), the RTI Unit established within LD handled 188 information requests and 23 appeals relating to the Central Bank during 2022. It actively engaged in enhancing public awareness on financial sector issues namely, prohibited schemes, unauthorised finance businesses, and evolving issues in the finance and leasing sector. Officers of LD represented the Central Bank in many fora as resource persons and served on several internal/ external committees including reviewing of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, Debt Restructuring Exercise of Sri Lankan Airlines Limited, the case filed by the Hamilton Reserve Bank in New York Federal Courts, developing a Financial Asset Management Agency framework, and the National Financial Inclusion Strategy of the country.

20. MACROPRUDENTIAL SURVEILLANCE

The Macroprudential Surveillance Department (MSD), with the objective of maintaining financial system stability in the country, a core statutory objective of the Central Bank, conducts a wide range of analysis to assess the buildup of systemic risk affecting the financial system. For this purpose, MSD gathers data from regulated financial institutions, listed corporates, and various other sources to conduct analyses. The findings of these assessments facilitate the policy formulation process of the Central Bank and support the introduction of macroprudential policy measures to mitigate systemic risks in order to maintain financial system stability. Accordingly, such analyses complement microprudential regulation and supervision in ensuring financial system stability.

The macroprudential surveillance framework covers risks emanating from global and domestic macroeconomic developments, financial market activities, and the financial institutions sector using the data reported by regulated financial institutions and data collected by MSD from other sources. Further, MSD carries out stress testing exercises to assess vulnerabilities in financial institutions and analysis on household and corporate sector developments to assess the impact on financial system stability. Moreover, MSD continued to compile a number of composite financial system stability indicators to assess the stability and soundness of different subsectors of the domestic financial system, while taking steps to improve the reliability of these indices. Following such analyses, board papers including quarterly risk assessments were submitted by MSD to the Monetary Board highlighting possible risks to the stability of the financial system and other contemporary concerns over financial system stability during

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2022

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 112

Part II

the year 2022. Furthermore, MSD continued to facilitate sustainable finance related activities and a separate unit for the same was established within the department. A summary of the main activities undertaken by MSD during 2022 is given below.

(a) Stress Testing Framework

MSD conducted its biannual dynamic solvency stress testing on the banking sector which was developed with the Technical Assistance (TA) received from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The dynamic solvency stress test model provides a macroprudential perspective by assessing resilience of the financial system under hypothetical yet plausible scenarios. MSD was involved in formulating macroeconomic scenarios and granular level data collection on the banking sector and subsequently evaluated the impact of envisaged shocks on the banks’ resilience through the execution of the quantitative toolkit which embodies risk modules that stretch across the stress testing horizon. MSD continued the biannual static solvency stress testing of the Licensed Finance Companies (LFCs) sector based on hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios.

MSD enriched its systemic risk analysis through the liquidity stress testing conducted on the data collected from the banking sector through maturity ladder templates, which identifies cash inflow-outflow mismatches, that was developed with the assistance of IMF TA. The liquidity stress testing framework assesses the resilience of the banking sector to systemic liquidity shocks.

A new framework for interconnectedness and contagion analysis of the banking sector was developed with the assistance from IMF TA during the year. Interconnectedness and contagion analysis primarily focuses on the risks towards the banking system through interbank exposures and extends to assess the contagion risks emanating from the State Owned Entities and LFCs while factoring solvency and liquidity channels in the model. MSD conducted pilot interconnectedness and contagion analysis during the year.

(b) Surveys, Indices and Data Collection

MSD continued to conduct the Systemic Risk Survey (SRS) on a biannual basis, which is a forward looking survey that quantifies and tracks market participants’ perceptions on the potential risks to financial system stability signaling any buildup of systemic vulnerabilities and perceived probability of a high impact event. Materialisation of these risks could potentially disrupt the financial intermediation process and affect public confidence in the financial system. Further, SRS helps to validate the internal assessments of MSD on vulnerabilities of the financial system.

Further, MSD compiled several indices on a quarterly basis, namely, Banking Soundness Index (BSI), Licensed

Finance Companies Sector Soundness Index (LFCSI), Financial Market Stability Index (FMSI), and the composite Financial System Stability Index (FSSI) using FMSI, BSI and LFCSI.

With a view of enriching the database, MSD continued to gather granular level data from several external institutions, such as regulated financial institutions, Colombo Stock Exchange, Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka, Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Census and Statistics, and Credit Information Bureau, among several other data sources.

(c) Contributing to Statutory Reports and Other Publications of the Central Bank

The Financial System Stability Review (FSSR): MSD published the FSSR which evaluates risks and vulnerabilities faced by the Sri Lankan financial sector, and discusses the risk mitigation measures adopted during the period under consideration.

Statutory Publications: MSD continued to contribute to key publications of the Central Bank by coordinating and compiling the Chapter on “Financial Sector Performance and System Stability” of the Central Bank Annual Report 2021 and “Recent Economic Developments 2022”. Further, MSD contributed to the formulation on the section related to the financial system of the September 15th Report, which is a confidential report submitted to the Minister of Finance. In addition, MSD also contributed to other publications of the Central Bank by compiling financial sector data and providing analyses of subsectors of the financial system.

(d) Conducting Corporate Sector and Household Sector Analysis

MSD conducts analyses of Corporate Sector and Household Sector to assess financial vulnerabilities emanating from the two sectors. Thus, vulnerabilities of the corporate sector are analysed to assess risks emanating from Non-Financial Corporates (NFCs) to the financial system on a quarterly basis, using information on listed NFCs in the Colombo Stock Exchange, which serves as a proxy for the NFCs. In addition, MSD analyses the indebtedness of the Household and Institutional sectors to assess the financial vulnerabilities emanating from such borrowers and identify possible buildup of systemic risks. The analysis is carried out based on the quarterly aggregate credit data of the banks and LFCs/SLCs sector received from the Credit Information Bureau (CRIB).

(e) Coordination of Committees on Financial System Stability

Financial System Stability Committee (FSSC): MSD functioned as the Secretariat of the FSSC, which is an interdepartmental forum of the Central Bank established

Part II

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2022

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 113

for the identification of risks affecting the financial sector and facilitation of discussion of measures to mitigate risks and strengthen interdepartmental coordination efforts to promote financial system stability. During 2022, 11 FSSC meetings including seven restricted FSSC meetings for specific matters were conducted. Quarterly Risk Assessments (QRAs) and FSSR 2022 were presented to the FSSC to obtain the views of the members before submitting them to the Monetary Board.

Financial System Oversight Council (FSOC): MSD also functioned as the Secretariat of the FSOC, which comprises heads of core financial sector regulators to facilitate cooperation among member institutions to ensure the efficiency, soundness, and safety of the financial system. Accordingly, two FSOC meetings were conducted during the year 2022 to discuss and deliberate on the risks coming under the purview of the respective financial sector regulators.

Stakeholder Engagement Committee (SEC): Considering the interconnectedness of the monetary and financial sectors of the economy and the implications of changes in policy stance and responses of one sector to the other, SEC was established in 2022, comprising members from a diverse group of sectors. Accordingly, MSD participates in SEC meetings, conducts presentations as and when needed to apprise SEC on the macrofinancial developments, involves in the relevant discussions at the Committee meetings, and follows up on related actions proposed by the Committee.

(f) Coordinating and Facilitating Sustainable Finance Activities in Sri Lanka

In line with the Road Map for Sustainable Finance in Sri Lanka, MSD coordinated with domestic and international stakeholders engaged in sustainable financing and facilitated the implementation of the Road Map. Further, MSD also functioned as the Secretariat for the internal committees established in this regard.

(g) Coordination with International Agencies

MSD, as the coordinating department of the Financial System Stability cluster, engaged with the IMF in responding to the Macroprudential Survey. Further, as the relevant authority facilitating Sustainable Finance activities in line with the Road Map for Sustainable Finance in Sri Lanka, MSD coordinated with multilateral agencies including the International Finance Corporation (IFC), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Asian Development Bank (ADB), and United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP).

(h) Establishment of a Crisis Management Committee (CMC)

Financial crises are usually low probability, high impact events, for which most countries are unprepared. Hence,

the need to strengthen crisis preparedness and manage a financial crisis if one transpires was recognised by international agencies and the Central Bank. This requires buildup of legal, regulatory, and institutional architecture, in order to respond in a timely and effective way. As such, the World Bank highlighted the importance of the formation of a Financial Sector CMC as a forum for policy coordination. Accordingly, MSD took the initiative to develop the framework for the establishment of CMC, which will be a permanent forum to work during crisis times for effective financial crisis management and during non-crisis times to strengthen the financial crisis preparedness framework in the country.

21. PAYMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS

The Central Bank is the authority responsible for the administration, supervision, and regulation of the monetary, financial and payments system of Sri Lanka, as stated in Section 5 of the Monetary Law Act (MLA), No. 58 of 1949. The statutory mandate entrusted to the Central Bank under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, No. 28 of 2005, is carried out by the Payments and Settlements Department (PSD) which regulates and oversees the payment and settlement systems and implements national payment system policy with the objective of ensuring safety, efficiency, competitiveness, and stability of the payment and settlement systems in Sri Lanka.

The main functions carried out by PSD are operations of the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System, carrying out back office functions relating to the management of the international reserves, management of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) System on behalf of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, carrying out transactions routed through the Asian Clearing Union (ACU) mechanism, regulation and oversight of payment and settlement systems, and the regulation and supervision of payment service providers.

21.1 Operations of the Real Time Gross Settlement System

Section 62A of the MLA gives the authority to the Central Bank to establish and operate systems for transfer of funds, settle payment obligations, and issue system rules to participating institutions. Accordingly, PSD operates the RTGS System which settles time critical large value inter-participant payments such as the settlement of transactions with Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) and Primary Dealers (PDs) in relation to open market operations, standing Deposit Facility (SDF) and the Standing Lending Facility (SLF) as well as customer payments on real time gross basis.

Adhering to international best practices, the availability of the LankaSettle System, which includes the RTGS System and the scripless government securities settlement system, was maintained at a level of 99.75 per cent on average during the year. In order to ensure smooth functioning

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 114

Part II

of the RTGS System PSD monitored the provisioning of intraday liquidity through the Intraday Liquidity Facility (ILF) to the Participating Institutions (PIs) which requested extra funds. PIs of the RTGS System are the Central Bank, LCBs, one Licensed Specialised Bank (LSB), standalone PDs, Employees’ Provident Fund, and the Central Depository System of the Colombo Stock Exchange.

As at end 2022, the number of PIs of the RTGS System was 35. During the year, the RTGS System settled 638,733 transactions with a total value of Rs. 827 trillion. The average volume and value of RTGS transactions settled per day were 2,661 and Rs. 3,446 billion, respectively. With regard to ILF operations, on average, Rs. 658.5 billion per day was released to PIs.

(a) Back-Office Functions Related to the Management of the International Reserves

Back office functions were carried out to facilitate the management of the international reserves of the country. A total of 3,495 transactions including foreign exchange trading and funding, money market transactions, and overnight repo/reverse repo transactions were carried out during the year 2022.

(b) Settlement of Transactions Related to Open Market Operations, the Standing Deposit Facility, and the Standing Lending Facility

For the purpose of facilitating the management of market liquidity, PSD engaged in the settlement of Repo and Reverse Repo transactions carried out under Open Market Operations, in addition to the settlement of transactions related to the SLF and the SDF. During the period under review, PSD facilitated and effected 232 Repo transactions amounting to Rs. 1,550.3 billion, 78 Reverse Repo transactions amounting to Rs. 1,189.5 billion, 4,966 SDF transactions amounting to Rs. 54,183.1 billion, 9563 SLF transactions amounting to Rs. 163,073.8 billion, and 43 Outright Sale transactions amounting to Rs. 27.7 billion.

21.2 Management of the SWIFT Communication Network

PSD managed the SWIFT system on behalf of all users of the Central Bank in accordance with the procedures laid out by the SWIFT Headquarters, such as governance arrangements, processes, risk management procedures, and controls.

Mandatory updates provided by SWIFT during the year 2022 were applied to strengthen the SWIFT system and to provide a highly secure and more efficient service for the SWIFT users in line with international standards.

SWIFT has embarked on a global project to migrate financial messages to ISO 20022 standard. It is an open standard which has a rich format and facilitates a better flow of information. PSD is also working towards adopting the ISO 20022 messaging standard.

21.3 Facilitating Transactions under the Asian Clearing Union (ACU)

Part II

consideration to both external and internal factors and with a direction for the medium term. The five key focus areas are as follows:

• Regaining price and economic stability via the implementation of the macroeconomic stabilisation framework

• Preserving financial system stability with enhanced crisis preparedness and management

• Clear and concise communication to improve public and other stakeholder understanding

• Availability of a highly productive, motivated, engaged, and contended team of human resources

22.4 Policy Review

Three policy studies were conducted during the year on the Effectiveness of Procurement Process of the Central Bank, the Central Bank’s Role on Regional Development, and Optimising Resource Allocation of the Central Bank via Restructuring.

23. PUBLIC DEBT

The Public Debt Department (PDD), established on 28th August 1950 at the inception of the Central Bank, is responsible for discharging statutory obligations of the Central Bank as the agent of the Government for management of public debt in terms of Section 113 of the Monetary Law Act (MLA), No. 58 of 1949. In this endeavour, the key functions performed by PDD include, among others, developing and maintaining an efficient government securities market, ensuring availability of required information for market participants and the general public, ensuring that the Government’s financing needs are met at the lowest possible cost at a prudent level of risk while adhering to best standards and practices, and servicing government debt on time in line with relevant policies. In this context, activities carried out by the PDD in 2022 are summarised below.

23.1 Raising of Funds to Meet the Government’s Gross Borrowing Requirement

(a) Amidst the extremely challenging environment arising from deteriorating macroeconomic fundamentals, uncertainties emanating from socio-political instability, and speculations on the debt restructuring perimeter, the Government’s substantive domestic funding requirement on maturing debt was aggressively pursued mainly through market subscription to Treasury bills and Treasury bonds, while adhering to prudent debt management measures.

(b) Investor preference was skewed towards short term Treasury bill maturities while greater investor preference was observed for longer tenure Treasury bonds.

(c) Funds to meet a part of the foreign currency debt requirement of the General Treasury was raised through the issuance of Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) through both auction and Direct Issuance Window arrangements during the first half of 2022.

(d) An abridged table of activities under each of the source of funds is given below.

23.2 Servicing of Government Debt

In line with its interim policy regarding the servicing of external public debt dated 12 April 2022, the Government halted servicing outstanding foreign currency denominated external public debt, except for debt owed to multilateral agencies. Meanwhile, the Government appointed Lazard Frères SAS and Clifford Chance LLP as financial and legal advisors, respectively, in May 2022 to initiate the restructuring process of the Government’s external debt.

SLDBs were excluded from the “Affected Debts” identified under interim policy regarding the servicing of external public debt dated 12 April 2022. An alternative mechanism for settlement of SLDBs was introduced based on constraints on availability of liquid foreign currency resources and following options were extended to investors.

(a) Settlement in Sri Lanka rupees subject to monetary policy considerations.

(c) Facilitation of government securities (Treasury bonds) at the immediately preceding primary market weighted average yield rate, preferably within seven business days from the corresponding primary auction. For any other government security, with remaining maturity other than the maturities offered at the immediately preceding primary auction, primary market weighted average yields will be interpolated or extrapolated, as necessary.

Total debt service payments amounting to Rs. 2,997,645 million were facilitated during 2022 which included domestic and foreign debt service payments amounting to Rs. 2,510,281 million and Rs. 487,364 million, respectively. Therein, external debt servicing was executed in line with the Government’s interim policy on servicing of external public debt dated 12 April 2022. In servicing domestic currency debt, 218 International Securities Identification Numbers (ISINs) were processed during 2022 as coupon and maturity payments viz-a-viz 224 ISINs processed during 2021. Similarly, in servicing foreign currency debt, 1,249 service payments were processed in 2022 compared to 1,836 payments processed in 2021.

23.3 Maintenance of the Title Registry in Government Securities

The Title Registry of scripless government securities is recorded in the Central Depository System (CDS). The total holdings in scripless securities as at end December 2022 amounted to Rs. 12,848.5 billion in face value comprising Rs. 4,126.3 billion in Treasury bills and Rs. 8,722.1 billion in Treasury bonds. The number of registered CDS accounts holders as at end December 2022 was recorded at 129,627.

Periodic statements to CDS account holders on their holdings, transactions and payments have been sent continuously throughout the year. PDD has sent 13,424 statements in electronic form and 48,530 semi-annual statements of holdings, 105,863 monthly statements of transactions and 40,089 payment statements by post to CDS account holders during 2022.

The real-time notification facility introduced for consenting CDS account holders in 2019, delivering real-time notifications for each and every debit and credit record of scripless securities by way of an SMS or/and email alert to such CDS account holders facilitated 260,028 emails and 121,634 SMS alerts as real-time notifications compared to 147,744 and 47,561 respectively, in 2021.

In addition, CDS account holders were provided with the facility to view account details online, among other facilities

introduced to enhance the safety features of government securities investments.

23.4 Facilitation of the Settlement of Government Securities

CDS together with the Scripless Security Settlement System (SSSS) constitute the LankaSecure system, operated and maintained by PDD. SSSS provides the settlement services for the primary and secondary market transactions in government securities. PDD plays a main role in facilitating settlement of transactions in government securities by ensuring uninterrupted real-time operation of the LankaSecure system.

By end 2022, the LankaSecure system consisted of 32 Dealer Direct Participants (24 Licensed Commercial Banks, 1 Licensed Specialised Bank, and 7 Primary Dealer Companies) maintaining accounts on their own behalf and on behalf of their customers who are investors of government securities and 3 Direct Participants (the Central Bank, Colombo Stock Exchange, and Employees’ Provident Fund) who hold accounts on their own behalf only.

23.5 Debt Management Initiatives and Market Developments

In order to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency while meeting the required resources through appropriate sources, with the purpose of developing the government securities market, the following initiatives were undertaken during 2022:

(a) Introduction of Phase II for Treasury bill Auctions

Phase II for Treasury bill auctions was introduced for further subscription following the respective Treasury bill auction. The maximum amount offered for Phase II is limited to the auction shortfall (if any) plus 25 per cent of the aggregate amount offered at the auction for subscription by auction participants at the WAYRs determined for respective maturities at the auction. In the event of oversubscription, the allocation is made based on aggregate successful participation of auction participants at the auction.

(b) Introduction of an Incentive Scheme for Promotion of Investments in SLDBs via the Direct Issuance Window (DIW)

An incentive scheme for the arrangers of investments in SLDBs via DIW was introduced in February 2022 with the objective of encouraging investments in SLDBs particularly by recipients of export proceeds and other foreign currency holders. A promotional or handling fees equivalent to 0.5 per cent (50 basis points) on the SLDB investments brought in through the DIW was provided as an incentive to Arrangers through Designated Agents (DAs) in Sri Lanka rupees by the Central Bank.

(c) Introduced a Non-Reserve Management System to replace the Treasury Management System.

Initiated the process for the establishment of a new external debt payment system under the Non-Reserve Management System to replace the current Treasury Management System. The main purpose of the system is to increase the efficiency of the foreign debt service payment process. This has been effective from 01 January 2022.

(d) Capital Market Infrastructure Development Project

Proposed implementation of the state-of-the-art infrastructure under the ongoing Capital Market Development Project (CMDP) is expected to develop the Sri Lankan government securities market in par with international best practices by upgrading its landscape in trading and settlement. BTA Consulting Limited of the United Kingdom has been providing consultancy services for the project. CMDP is envisaged to implement an Electronic Trading Platform (ETP), a Central Clearing House (CCH), an upgraded Central Securities Depository (CSD) and a market surveillance system. However, the procurement did not take place during 2022 due to the country’s economic woes and is planned to be recommenced in 2023.

(e) Initiation of the Digitalization Programme of LankaSecure Services

Arrangements have been made since mid 2022 to promote the electronic services provided by the LankaSecure system, envisaging full conversion of its services to electronic mode from existing physical and paper based services in the year 2023. Through digitalisation of its services, LankaSecure is expected to be on par with world’s technological advancements, thereby reducing the costs and delays in communication, as well as broadening investor information.

(f) Assisting the Authorities for the Establishment of the Envisaged Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA)

The Government announced in its Interim Budget 2022 presented to Parliament in August 2022 of setting up a National Debt Management Agency (NDMA) in lieu of current arrangement in this respect. PDD provided the technical assistance in this regard, as and when required.

23.6 Coordinating Sovereign Rating Review Missions

In 2022, PDD facilitated international rating agencies (Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Services, S & P Global Ratings) for their rating reviews in line with rating engagements.

24. REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT

In 2022, the Regional Development Department (RDD) embarked on developing and implementing new policy strategies to increase financial inclusiveness of the country and explored the means of increasing the efficiency of the credit operations by partially automating the manual processes involved with such operations. RDD also focused on agriculture value chain financing initiatives, recognising the fundamental necessities of the farmers and other value chain participants and their potential to contribute to the national economy.

Against this backdrop, RDD continued to coordinate, facilitate, and implement various Refinance, Interest Subsidy and Credit Guarantee Schemes while providing a range of credit supplementary services during the year. These schemes were funded by the Central Bank, Government, Donor Agencies, and Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs).

On the financial inclusion front, RDD housed the National Financial Inclusion Secretariat established to coordinate, monitor, and evaluate the activities of Sri Lanka’s first ever National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) launched in 2021. By the end of 2022, NFIS had achieved a significant progress with the support of key implementing agencies led by the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance.

The Pilot Phase of the Domestic Agriculture Development program (DAD-PP) has been reviewed by a team of consultants from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) on behalf of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to explore the posibilities in funding the main DAD programme, which is expected to be implemented in 2024.

During the year, several measures were taken in respect of the schemes implemented by RDD including changing applicable interest rates, extending operational periods, providing debt moratoria etc., and identifying the requirements of the market and beneficiaries, in order to provide better tailored products to the underserved segments. In doing so, RDD, considering the credit risk borne by the PFIs, continued to share the credit risk through the guarantee schemes against loans granted to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).

With the social distancing practices and regulations discontinued, RDD together with the Regional Offices which represent Central Bank at the regional level, reintroduced in-person financial literacy, entrepreneurship development, and other programs to cater to the needy segments of the economy and also to increase financial inclusion in the country.

24.1 Expansion of Concessionary Credit Facilities

During 2022, RDD continued to broaden the financial outreach by implementing 22 refinance, interest subsidy and/or credit guarantee schemes and details of the schemes are given in Table II-18.

Part II

The loans disbursed through these schemes amounted to Rs. 8,240.8 million or 47.8 per cent of the total loan disbursements in 2022 catering to 54,046 beneficiaries.

(a) Interest Subsidy and Credit Guarantee Schemes funded by the Government

Being the most sought out credit option of the farmers, the New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS) namely ‘Sarusara’, which is an interest subsidy and a credit guarantee scheme continued its operations in 2022 as well, supporting island wide farmers to meet their short term working capital requirements. Through NCRCS, Rs 7,251.7 million was released in 2022 for 48,762 farmers who cultivated 34 short term crop varieties. The amount of loans released by PFIs under this scheme represented 88.0 per cent of the disbursements made under government funded schemes.

The applicable interest rates and scale of finance of NCRCS were amended in 2022 by issuing amendments to the NCRCS Operating Instructions. The purpose of these amendments was to encourage agricultural activities in the country to ensure food security, reduce the foreign exchange outflow on food imports, make people more inclined towards agricultural products, and to uplift the socio-economic conditions of the small-scale farmers. Prevailing economic conditions in the country and the relevant government policy measures were also considered when introducing these amendments. While loan funds for NCRCS is provided by the PFIs, the Government provided interest subsidy at a rate of 7 per cent per annum. Interest cost to the end borrower stands at 8 per cent per annum. The Government paid Rs.78.6 million during 2022 as interest subsidy under NCRCS.

The implementation period of the Smallholder Tea and Rubber Revitalization (STaRR) Interest Subsidy Scheme

scheduled to end on 31.12.2022 was extended up to 30.06.2023 in line with the extension of the STaRR Project implemented by the Project Management Unit (PMU) of STaRR. Moreover, in line with the developments of the market, Operating Instructions of the STaRR Interest Subsidy Scheme to change the interest rates of the scheme appropriately. Accordingly, Operating Instructions of the STaRR Interest Subsidy Scheme were amended to increase the rate for end borrower from 6.5 per cent to 9 per cent for the period from 08 July 2022 to 31 December 2022. In the financial front, RDD in collaboration with the PMU of STaRR Project disbursed Rs. 37.8 million among 180 beneficiaries in 2022.

(b) Refinance Schemes Funded by the Government

In 2022, RDD disbursed Rs. 951.3 million among 5,104 beneficiaries through 9 government funded refinance schemes.

Moreover, the Administrative Agreement signed with the Government was amended to extend the operational period of the Self-Employment Promotion Initiative Loan Scheme-Phase II (SEPI Phase II) which is intended to provide financial assistance to youth trained by recognised vocational training institutions for establishment of their own self-employment projects for five years commencing from 01.01.2023.

24.1.2 Implementation of Central Bank Funded Schemes

With a view to broadening the financial outreach of the MSMEs in Sri Lanka, the Central Bank continued to fund 7 major credit schemes during 2022 and Rs. 8,740.2 million was disbursed among 8,559 beneficiaries under these 7 schemes.

The credit operations of Saubagya (Prosperity) Loan Scheme, the flagship loan scheme operated by the Central Bank, was also continued successfully in 2022 disbursing Rs. 7,706.63 million among 8,062 beneficiaries. Moreover, Operating Instructions of the Scheme were amended to increase the interest rate to 9 per cent, while instructing PFIs to ensure that a minimum of 80 per cent of the new loans are granted for agriculture, livestock, fisheries, and related activities given the importance of accelerating fund disbursements to agriculture sector.

The DAD–PP program was established as a refinance scheme with the intention of introducing a comprehensive development package for the benefit of the smallholder farming community by offering them with a range of technical and financial assistance to enhance production

and product quality and promote market opportunities through well connected agriculture value chains. The prominent feature of this scheme is the involvement of Lead Players selected by the PFIs who are expected to take lead in streamlining the identified value chain and confirm the participation of the players in the relevant agriculture value chain. They could be private sector organisations involved in the value chain or any other value chain participant that

has agreed to play the role of the lead player. This scheme is expected to be introduced as a comprehensive program in 2024 with ADB funding.

In this regard, ADB has expressed willingness to provide financial assistance to continue the DAD program in full scale by providing USD 100 million given the importance of establishing a well coordinated agriculture value chain program in the current context. Accordingly, a team of PWC

RDD ensures the regional level representation of the Central Bank through the six Regional Offices located in Anuraphapura, Kilinochchi, Matale, Matara, Nuwara Eliya and Trincomalee. While encouraging and promoting regional economic development, the Regional Offices coordinate implementation of key activities of the Central Bank regionally such as handling Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) related matters, data collection initiatives, survey related activities, selling Central Bank publications and commemorative coins and notes.

The Regional Offices also make tangible efforts to enhance financial inclusion and financial literacy among general public at the regional level in line with the objectives of NFIS and shoulder special projects of RDD at the regional level. They also take measures to improve awareness of the general public, law enforcement agencies, and public and private institutions at the regional level, by conducting awareness sessions, seminars and workshops on services and functions of Central Bank, such as formal banking, financial services provided by authorised/licensed financial institutions, loan schemes implemented by those institutions and identification of counterfeit notes.

During 2022, the six Regional Offices directly handled 143,882 queries/requests related to EPF and 1,658 public grievances on various aspects. With regard to the survey related activities, all Regional Offices covered 1,262 samples in different districts while conducting 184 awareness programs on Foreign Remittance, Unauthorised Deposit Taking, Prohibited Financial Schemes, Counterfeit Notes, and Forge Notes Identification.

24.5. Other Initiatives

24.5.1 Green Village Programme

During 2022, RDD continued its relationships with strategically important international bodies such as Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI), Asian Credit Supplementation Institution Confederation (ACSIC) and Asia-Pacific Rural and Agricultural Credit Association (APRACA). During the year, the Central Bank joined the South Asia Region Financial Inclusion Initiative (SARFII), the South Asian arm of AFI, by signing the Charter to drive the financial inclusion in the country.

25. RESOLUTION AND ENFORCEMENT

The Resolution and Enforcement Department (RED) contributed towards preserving the financial system stability of Sri Lanka, which is one of the core objectives of the Central Bank, by effectively managing the main financial safety net mechanism of Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance and Liquidity Support Scheme (SLDILSS). Further, RED contributed to financial system stability by conducting investigations on prohibited schemes based on the provisions of Section 83C of the Banking Act, No.30 of 1988 and drafting the legal framework for resolution of licensed banks and non-bank financial institutions, regulated and supervised by the Central Bank.

A summary of activities carried out by the department during the year 2022 is given below.

25.1. Administration of the Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance and Liquidity Support Scheme (SLDILSS)

RED continued carrying out of all operational and management arrangements of SLDILSS during the year in terms of Regulations and Policies approved by the Monetary Board. Further, in order to strengthen the legal framework of SLDILSS, provisions related to the Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance Scheme were included in the draft Banking (Special Provisions) Act to be enacted during the year 2023. With the enactment of the Banking (Special Provisions) Act, the Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance Scheme would be able to contribute to certain resolution measures and accordingly the existing mandate of SLDILSS would be enhanced from its existing mandate of “Pay Box”.

As at end 2022, the Scheme comprised of 67 Member Institutions with a total fund size approximately Rs. 86,107.9 million (audited). Financial highlights of SLDILSS are given in Table II-20 below.

25.4 Development of a Resolution Framework for Licensed Financial Institutions of the Central Bank

In order to strengthen the resolution framework for licensed financial institutions of the Central Bank, RED contributed towards drafting Banking (Special Provisions) Act while obtaining technical support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) thereto.

The draft Banking (Special Provisions) Act includes provisions for establishing the Central Bank as the resolution authority in respect of licensed banks and it enables the application of such authority to non-bank financial institutions licensed, regulated, and supervised by the Central Bank. The proposed Act sets out resolution measures that can be exercised by the Central Bank and the Government of Sri Lanka as the case may be, to resolve a financial institution covered under the Act in a timely manner, to revive such financial institution as a going concern to ensure the interest of the depositors and creditors and thereby ensure financial system stability. In addition, it includes enhanced provisions related to the Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance Scheme and winding up procedures related to said financial institutions.

The approval of the Cabinet of Ministers for the draft Banking (Special Provisions) Act has been communicated to the Legal Draftsman Department for drafting the Act. This Act is expected to be enacted in early 2023.

26. RISK MANAGEMENT

In pursuing its policy objectives, the Central Bank faces various risks, both financial and non-financial in nature. Since the materialisation of any such risks could have an adverse impact on the achievement of objectives, financial position, and reputation of the Central Bank, having a properly designed risk management framework in place is vital.

The Risk Management Department (RMD) sets out the policies for implementation of risk management across the Central Bank as stipulated in the Risk Management Policy Statement (RMPS) developed in line with the risk management framework of the Central Bank. In this process, the Central Bank follows accepted standards, guidelines, and best practices for managing risks, while assigning risk ownership and management among different stakeholders with clear accountability.

26.1 Operational Risk

In order to keep the risk identification process up to date and to effectively manage any risk involved in operations, RMD reviewed the Operational Risk Taxonomy of the Central Bank and incorporated amendments as required during 2022.

Continuing the facilitation provided for departmental risk assessments, RMD worked closely with other departments in assisting the development of Departmental Risk Registers.

With the view of promoting a risk culture within the Central Bank, RMD conducted risk awareness sessions for the Central Bank staff throughout the year.

RMD continued to administer incidents reported through the Incident Reporting System, enabling the development of a central repository of incidents and tracking progress on the implementation of corrective measures. The information gathered through this system helps in identifying possible risk trends and areas of vulnerabilities and improving related risk treatment measures.

26.2 Financial Risk

As the second line of defence, RMD independently monitors, analyses, evaluates, and reports financial risks covering credit, market and liquidity risks. Further, it monitors compliance with Investment Policy Statements (IPS), Strategic Asset Allocations (SAA) and Investment Guidelines (IG) developed in line with the RMPS, relating to International Reserves (IR), Internal Investment Funds (IIF) of the Central Bank and Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), which is carried out as an agency function for the Government.

RMD revised IPS for IIF and IR, SAA for IIF, EPF and IR, IG for IIF and IR, incorporating amendments as required. RMD assessed market and credit risks by frequent analysis of the relevant risk indicators and monitored adherence to the limit framework given in IPS, SAA, and IG for EPF, IIF and IR. Risk assessments and non-compliances were presented at relevant

monthly Investment Oversight Committee (IOC) meetings.

RMD reviewed and revised the Risk Management Policy Statement (RMPS) with the view of further improving the risk management mechanism currently in use.

In addition, RMD commenced developing a Risk Appetite Framework (RAF) for the Central Bank and completed a study report on RAF which was circulated and discussed at the Non-Financial Risk Management Committee (NFRMC) and with the two external members of the Board Risk Oversight Committee (BROC).

Operational risks were reported to the NFRMC, and both operational and financial risks were reported to the Monetary Board through the BROC on a quarterly basis, to effectively manage risks related to operations and fund management activities of the Central Bank.

27. SECRETARIAT

The Secretariat Department (SD) is one of the few Departments that were established at the inception of the Central Bank. The main functions of SD involve overall corporate administration of the Central Bank, procurement management, administration of superannuation funds, facilitating overseas studies and training, conducting the Board of Survey for assets disposal management, and provision of secretarial assistance to the Monetary Board, Governor, Deputy Governors and Assistant Governors and protocol assistance to the Governor.

29. STAFF SERVICES MANAGEMENT

The role of the Staff Services Management Department (SSMD) is to facilitate the wellbeing of the staff of the Central Bank, ensuring an efficient, healthy, and satisfied labour force. Hence the welfare facilities of SSMD are designed to foster good physical and mental health of Central Bank employees and to promote a healthy working environment. Key services rendered

by the department include disbursement of loans under the Staff Housing (mortgage) Loan Scheme; Provident Fund Loan Scheme, and Staff Benefit Scheme (SBS) including the Staff Vehicle Loan Scheme, reimbursement of medical expenses under the Employer Contributory Medical Benefit Scheme (MBS), provision of medical facilities to the staff, provision of restaurant facilities, and other staff welfare services. These services covering housing, vehicle, medical, and other welfare needs of staff help in raising employees’ standard of living, facilitating a contended and motivated workforce that can work with a high level of efficiency and integrity. Moreover, medical needs of dependents of Central Bank staff as well as pensioners are also looked after under the MBS scheme.

Amidst the challenging environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, SSMD continued to extend welfare facilities to all beneficiaries during the year 2022. Special measures were taken to comply with the guidelines issued by the health authorities regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and SSMD facilitated additional services required by staff including vaccination programs for the employees at the Central Bank Head Office premises in 2022. SSMD continued the disbursement of housing, vehicle, and other welfare loans to the staff and reimbursement of medical expenses incurred by all beneficiaries registered under the MBS during the year.

The major activities of the department during 2022 included forecasting near term inflation and GDP to be used in the policy formulation process, collecting data and compiling indices to provide timely information for the data driven decision making process, and disseminating information through publications.

30.1 Forecasting Near Term Inflation and GDP to be Used in the Policy Formulation Process

STD continuously engaged in forecasting near term inflation and GDP growth, contributing to the Forecasting and Policy Analysis System (FPAS) of the Central Bank. Accordingly, the model based and indicator based forecasts were produced using relevant inputs from various sources. These forecasts were detailed and discussed at regular monetary policy cycles and submitted to the Monetary Board (MB) to facilitate policy decision making.

30.1.1 Forecasting Near Term Inflation

The latest price trends and expected price movements associated with market developments and econometric techniques were used to forecast near term inflation based on both the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) and National Consumer Price Index (NCPI). In line with continuous efforts to improve inflation forecasting, STD explored new variables and data sources that reflected both supply and demand side impact on inflation and novel forecasting models using time series and machine learning techniques.

30.1.2 Forecasting Near Term GDP

Near term GDP growth forecasts were prepared on a quarterly basis using both indicator and model based techniques. Primary and secondary leading economic indicators and survey findings related to economic activities were combined with expert judgments in indicator based forecasting, while model based forecasts were prepared using econometrics techniques.

30.2 Collecting Data and Compiling Indices to Provide Timely Information for Data Driven Decision Making Process

STD continuously engaged in collecting data through surveys, Country Wide Data Collection System (CWDCS), and other several institutions to compile indicators/indices. The analytical outcomes of these and relevant analyses were utilised in forecasting GDP/inflation and provided to the management to be considered in decision making process. Meanwhile, some information was published on the Central Bank website.

30.2.1 Survey Based Data Collection and Compilation of Indices

30.2.1.1 Purchasing Managers’ Index Surveys

The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) surveys were conducted on a monthly basis to gather timely information

about the economy. The PMI surveys target large companies predominantly concentrating on the Western province, covering manufacturing, construction and services activities. The results were used as high frequency leading indicators to evaluate the recent developments in the respective economic activities in the indicator based GDP forecasting process. Further, the evaluations that were made based on the survey findings were reported to the management for policymaking purposes. The results of Manufacturing and Services PMI surveys were released as monthly press notices for the use of analysts and the general public.

30.2.1.2 Business Outlook Survey

The Business Outlook Survey (BOS), which provides a snapshot of business sentiments regarding the existing and expected developments of the economy, was continued as a quarterly survey during 2022. The target population of this survey was large scale enterprises covering agriculture, industry and services activities of the economy. The aggregate results and key insights were submitted to MPC and MB, while economic growth forecasts were made based on the survey findings using statistical methodologies. Further, an executive summary, along with key indices, was published quarterly on the Central Bank website for the information of external users.

30.2.1.3 Condominium Market Survey

The quarterly Condominium Market Survey (CMS) was conducted covering major condominium developers to collect data on condominium sector developments including information on actual sales, reasons for price changes, actual and anticipated demand, funding structure, number of current and upcoming housing units, project occupancy levels and buyer portfolio information. The information gathered through the survey was reported to the management through a quarterly report adding insights to Central Bank’s policymaking process in terms of the financial system stability. In addition, a quarterly price index for new condominiums, which facilitates identifying the overall changes in the price level of new condominiums, was compiled based on the sales data collected through the survey. Survey findings in summary form were published on the Central Bank website on a quarterly basis.

30.2.1.4 Inflation Expectations Survey

Inflation Expectations Survey (IES) was continued on a monthly basis to collect data and information on inflation expectations of two main categories of economic agents, namely, the Corporate Sector and the Household Sector. During 2022, the Corporate Sector surveys were continued as email-based surveys, while the Household Sector surveys were conducted in virtual mode. These virtual surveys were conducted in collaboration with Regional Offices at

Matale, Anuradhapura, Kilinochchi, Trincomalee and Nuwara Eliya for the employees of selected public sector institutions, during which the participants were briefed on the purpose and importance of the survey and the theoretical aspects on inflation. In addition, Household Sector survey responses were also collected continuously from the Teacher Investigators (TIs) of the CWDCS on a monthly basis. Meanwhile, IES was expanded to capture the inflation expectations of the Research Institutes during the fourth quarter of 2022. The survey findings of the IES were reported to the MPC for consideration in the policymaking process.

30.2.1.5 Other Surveys

Two surveys to assess the Credit Conditions in the economy, namely, the Credit Demand Survey (CDS) and Credit Supply Survey (CSS), which capture the demand and supply side developments of the credit market activities, respectively, were continued during the year 2022. CDS, targeting Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) of the economy, was carried out as an annual survey in association with the Regional Offices of the Central Bank to identify credit related developments and issues experienced by SMEs, particularly during this unprecedented time. Meanwhile, CSS was conducted on a quarterly basis in 2022 covering all LCBs and LSBs to capture the recent developments and the outlook of the credit supply related activities in Sri Lanka. The results of both CDS and CSS were used in the policy formulation process of the Central Bank, while the results of CSS were also published on the Central Bank website for the benefit of the general public.

Further, the monthly Retail Sales Volume Survey (RSVS) and the quarterly Supermarket Retail Trade Survey (SRTS), were continued during the year to understand the developments in the general and modern trade segments of the retail sector, respectively. The findings were used in the indicator based GDP forecasting process.

The Survey on Transportation Services, which covers land transportation, air transportation, port and logistic services, was continued as a monthly survey during 2022 to capture the developments in the transportation sector. Further, a survey was carried out to identify the developments related to the Information Technology and Business Process Management (IT & BPM) sector during 2022 and the prospects for 2023. The findings of these surveys were used for internal economic analyses, particularly in the economic growth forecasting process.

The Annual Public Sector Employment Survey was continued in 2022, covering all public sector institutions, i.e. institutions under the central government and provincial councils to assess the developments in public sector employment.

STD, in addition to its regular surveys, undertakes numerous surveys based on the requirements that may arise spontaneously due to the occurrence of contingent events that might have a significant impact on the economy and/or central banking activities. During 2022, several such surveys were conducted, namely, Survey on Other Personal Services, Survey on Labour Demand, and Survey on the Effectiveness of COVID-19 Concessionary Loans Provided by the Regional Development Department of the Central Bank.

30.2.2 Country Wide Data Collection System

Operations of CWDCS continued in 2022 with the engagement of 53 TIs in order to collect retail prices of an identical basket of goods to that of NCPI, producer prices of agricultural commodities and building materials, daily wages of the informal sector workers, inflation expectations, and retail sales volumes of selected categories of goods, thereby providing timely inputs for inhouse policymaking processes. With the view to enhancing the quality of the data collected through CWDCS, on-site and off-site supervisions were carried out in collaboration with the Regional Offices of the Central Bank. Further, the annual seminar was conducted at CBS with the participation of all TIs in order to improve the quality of data and to discuss the issues faced by the TIs during the data collection process. Reports were generated continuously from data of CWDCS through Tableau software and the data/information collected on a weekly, monthly and quarterly basis during the year was used in forecasting price movements and inflation. In addition, as per the request of the Consumer Affairs Authority, selected data from CWDCS was continually shared with them on a weekly basis.

STD continued to obtain the services of non-teacher data investigators to collect data/information on wholesale and retail prices from the Pettah market, Marandagahamula rice market, Dambulla and Narahenpita Special Economic Centres, and Negombo and Peliyagoda Fish markets on a daily basis in order to strengthen the management information system. Furthermore, a summary of these price data was published on the Central Bank website on a daily basis. In addition, as per the request of the Presidential Secretariat, prices of the selected food items were shared with them on a daily basis during the year.

Further, STD continued to compile leading indicators using food prices available on the websites of two leading supermarkets on a daily basis.

30.2.3 Data Collection through Other Sources and Compilation of Indices

30.2.3.1 Wage Rate Indices

STD compiled wage rate indices for public, formal and informal private sectors to assess the movements of

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2022

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 128

Part II

salaries and wages of the economy. Accordingly, nominal and real Wage Rate Indices for the Public Sector were compiled monthly based on the public administration salary circulars. In terms of the formal private sector, Real Wage Rate Indices were compiled monthly, based on the nominal wage rate indices for employees whose wages are governed by the wage boards provided by the Department of Labour.

Meanwhile, the real and nominal Informal Private Sector Wage Rate Indices, which were used to analyse the movements of the informal private sector wages were compiled based on wage information collected through CWDCS. As an ongoing improvement to the index, in 2022, base year of this series was revised to 2018 from 2012. In addition, these wage rate indices were continued to submit to the Special Data Dissemination System (SDDS), FPAS, MPC and MB in 2022 for consideration in the policymaking process.

30.2.3.2 Property Market Indices

The price indices for residential property (condominiums, lands and houses) in the Colombo district were compiled by STD on a monthly basis using publicly available web based property advertisement data. The Department commenced publishing the Real Estate Market Analysis report on the Central Bank website since the first quarter of 2022, which includes the condominium market information gathered through the CMS and the above price indices.

STD continued to compile the Land Valuation Indicator (LVI) on a semi-annual basis to capture the developments in the real estate property market. The LVI comprises Residential, Commercial, and Industrial land values, which is based on per perch bare land price assessments collected from the Government Valuation Department under these three land categories. Two press releases on LVI were published in 2022 for public information.

30.2.4 Compiling Regional Statistics

30.2.4.1 Sri Lanka Prosperity Index

Sri Lanka Prosperity Index (SLPI) is a multidimensional indicator compiled by the Central Bank to measure the progress of the country specifically referring to socio economic aspects moving beyond the aspects considered in GDP. The index encompasses three sub-indices: Economic and Business Climate, Wellbeing of the People, and Socio Economic Infrastructure, which are compiled annually using appropriate provincial indicators. In 2022, STD compiled and published SLPI for the year 2021 using 41 representative variables.

30.2.4.2 Provincial Gross Domestic Product

Provincial Gross Domestic Product (PGDP) for the year 2021 was compiled by disaggregating the National Accounts estimates of the Department of Census and

Statistics (DCS) into the provinces using appropriate indicators/variables related to agriculture, industry and services activities. The relevant press release was issued by STD in December 2022. These estimates provide an approximation on the contribution of each province to the national GDP, which is useful for public authorities to decide on the allocation of resources among provinces.

30.2.5 Analysing Labour Market Information

Overall labour market data analyses with respect to the labour force, employment, unemployment, foreign employment, labour relations, and labour market reforms were done by STD, based on the statistics/information obtained from the DCS, Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment, Department of Labour, and other reliable data sources. Based on this analysis, a report was submitted to the management on a quarterly basis to support the policymaking process.

30.3 Disseminating Information

Regular dissemination of official statistics was continued by STD in 2022 in electronic modes amidst challenges faced in data collection. Accordingly, annual statistical publications, “Economic and Social Statistics of Sri Lanka 2022 – Volume XLIV” and “Sri Lanka Socio Economic Data 2022 – Volume XLV” were released. Further, high frequency data dissemination was done through the release of Daily Economic Indicators, which consist of data on exchange rates, money market rates, stock market, and energy sector statistics, and the release of a Daily Price Report of selected consumer items. Weekly and Monthly Economic Indicators were also published on the Central Bank website throughout the year in a timely manner.

The department contributed to two chapters of the Central Bank’s Annual Report and Recent Economic Developments report, while continuing to provide data for the Monthly Bulletin of the Central Bank.

Part II - 129

provisions of Registered Stock and Securities (Primary Dealers) Regulations No. 01 of 2009 (as amended) and Local Treasury Bills (Primary Dealers) Regulations No. 01 of 2009 (as amended).

DSNBFI’s supervisory function includes conducting statutory examinations (onsite supervision) and continuous surveillance (offsite supervision) of licensed/registered institutions, while the regulatory function involves issuance of licenses/registrations, prudential regulations, granting regulatory approvals, and investigating companies conducting finance business without authority. Apart from these major functions, DSNBFI also engages in several other activities such as capacity building of the sector, facilitating court proceedings, and attending to public complaints.

By end 2022, the Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs) sector comprised 37 LFCs, 1 SLC, 4 LMFCs, and 7 PDCs. Further, there were 54 Registered Finance Leasing Establishments (RFLEs) that possess registration under the FLA, including Licensed Banks, LFCs, and SLC. The names of these LFCs, SLC, RFLEs, LMFCs, and PDCs are provided at the end of this section.

The main functions and activities performed by DSNBFI during 2022 are summarised below.

31.1 Policy Measures

(a) Issuance of Prudential Regulations

During 2022, several prudential regulations were issued to streamline the existing regulatory framework of NBFIs in line with the current market conditions and international best practices in consultation with NBFIs and relevant other stakeholders of the sector. Such regulations issued to LFCs, SLCs, LMFCs, and PDCs during the year including extraordinary measures taken due to prevailing macroeconomic conditions are provided in Part III of this report. A summary of the major prudential measures introduced during 2022 is below:

i. Regulatory Framework on Technology Risk Management and Resilience

ii. Incentive for Sri Lankans working abroad on inward workers’ remittances

iii. Mobile phone based E-money Services

iv. Revision on maximum interest rates on deposits and debt instruments

v. Removal of maximum interest rate on microfinance loans

vi. Concessions to borrowers whose income or businesses have been adversely affected due to the current macroeconomic conditions

vii. Mandatory recording of the Unique Identification Numbers of the depositors of LFCs

viii. Guidelines on sustainable finance activities

(b) Amendments to the Finance Business Act and the Finance Leasing Act

DSNBFI is in the process of making necessary amendments to the FBA to enhance the supervision, regulation and resolution of LFCs and necessary amendments to the FLA to address irregularities in the finance leasing business.

(c) Implementation of Masterplan on Consolidation of NBFIs sector (the Masterplan)

i. In order to address the weaknesses and risk exposure in the LFCs/SLCs sector, the Masterplan was introduced in 2020.

ii. Under Phase I of the Masterplan, 5 transactions were fully completed during the year. Amalgamation of Sinhaputhra Finance PLC with Commercial Leasing and Finance PLC, Commercial Leasing and Finance PLC with LOLC Finance PLC and Prime Finance PLC with HNB Finance PLC were completed during the year. New finance business licenses were issued to Assetline Finance Ltd (previously known as Assetline Leasing Co. Ltd) and SMB Finance PLC (previously known as SMB Leasing PLC). Further, 3 proposed amalgamations under the Masterplan which were approved by the Monetary Board in 2022 are currently in progress.1

iii. Further, companies who were unable to find a merger partner under the Masterplan were directed to exit from the market upon cancellation of the license. Accordingly, the finance business license issued to Swarnamahal Financial Services PLC was cancelled in terms of Section 37 (3) of the FBA, and the Monetary Board of the Central Bank in terms of the section 25 (1) (m) of the FBA, decided to direct Kanrich Finance Ltd to settle its public liabilities in full.

31.2 Supervision of Licensed Institutions

(a) Conducting Statutory (On-Site) Examinations

(i) DSNBFI conducted statutory examinations of 13 LFCs and 4 PDCs during 2022. The main findings of the examinations included the deterioration in earnings and assets quality, risks of highly concentrated loan portfolios, weaknesses in the governance framework including related party transactions, lapses in the risk management, internal audit and compliance functions including lack of adequate resources to perform such functions effectively, and non-compliances with regulatory requirements.

(ii) The Monetary Board approved the recommendations for key supervisory concerns and the Time Bound Action Plans to rectify supervisory concerns identified during the examinations of LFCs/PDCs, which were communicated to the respective companies for necessary corrective actions.

1 Subsequently, LOLC Development Finance PLC was amalgamated with LOLC Finance PLC, w.e.f. 31.01.2023.

(iii) Further, DSNBFI conducted 25 spot examinations including spot examinations of 12 LFCs to assess the impairment model and spot examinations of 10 LFCs to assess the process of submission of regulatory information.

(b) Conducting Continuous (Off-Site) Surveillance

(i) All LFCs, SLCs, LMFCs and PDCs were continuously supervised based on the periodic financial information submitted to the Central Bank by LFCs/SLCs/LMFCs and PDCs through the web based fin-net system. The department also reviewed the other financial information including auditors’ reports, management letters, external ratings, and press reports. These reviews identified the potential risks of LFCs, SLCs, LMFCs, and PDCs through early warning indicators and an internal rating system on the areas of capital, liquidity and impairment, and the necessary recommendations were made when required.

(ii) DSNBFI took prompt corrective actions to rectify the supervisory concerns of the sector within a stipulated time frame, based on the assessments and severity of the findings. Further, the sector’s performance was reported to the Monetary Board on a quarterly basis in view of keeping the senior management informed of the latest developments in the sector.

(iii) DSNBFI granted 1,180 regulatory approvals to LFCs and SLCs to issue debt instruments, increase share capital, ownership transfers, capital infusions by new investors, amend the Articles of Association, formation of subsidiaries, annual branch expansion plans, advertisements and deposit incentive schemes, and appointment of new directors and key management personnel.

31.3 Regulatory and Resolution Actions

The key focus of DSNBFI during 2022 was to implement regulatory measures in an expeditious manner on companies non-compliant with prudential directions and facilitate measures on companies whose licenses have been cancelled or suspended. Accordingly, the following steps were taken in this regard.

borrowings on LFCs that were non-compliant with capital requirements in line with prompt corrective action framework.

ii. During 2022, the suspension of business of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. was extended twice on 05.01.2022 and 05.07.2022 and continues to remain in force for a further period of six months from 05.01.2023 in order to continue the investigations being conducted by the Central Bank.

Operating Instructions No: 01 of 2022 01 February 2022

To: All Dealer Direct Participants

Operating Instructions pertaining to the provision of the Intra-Day Liquidity Facility (ILF) Against Scripless Government Securities on LankaSettle System

These Operating instructions (OI) shall come into effect on 02 February 2022 and may be amended or varied by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) from time to time with reasonable notice to the Dealer Direct Participants (DDPs). OI pertaining to the provision of the ILF by the CBSL against eligible collateral are outlined below.

As provided for in the LankaSettle System Rules, the CBSL may, at its discretion, provide funds under the Intra-day Liquidity Facility (ILF) to DDPs of the LankaSettle System with a view to facilitating the smooth operation of the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System.

1. Ordinarily, all DDPs on LankaSettle, other than Designated Non-Dealer Bidders, are eligible for using the ILF. For the purposes of these OI;

i. LankaSettle System Rules (hereinafter referred to as the System Rules) are the rules issued by the CBSL for the operations of the LankaSettle System in terms of the Monetary Law Act, which may be amended from time to time.

ii. DDPs are the participants as defined under the general provisions of the System Rules. In order to become eligible for using the ILF, DDP shall sign an ILF Agreement in a prescribed form with the CBSL as required in rule 7.1 of volume 2 of the System Rules; and

iii. Eligible securities shall have the same meaning as defined in section 7.2 of volume 2 of the System Rules.

2. No encumbered security or a security owned by a third party shall be used by a DDP as collateral to avail the ILF. In the event a DDP was found to have used such security, the payments applicable to such use as specified in section 11.3 of volume 3 of the System Rules will be imposed.

3. Funds under the ILF are provided free of interest upon the DDP transferring eligible securities to the CBSL in accordance with these OI on the condition that the said securities shall be repurchased by the DDP by repaying the outstanding amount obtained under the ILF on or before the time specified for repayment of such amount in the daily operating schedule in the System Rules.

4. Substitution of securities provided as collateral for the ILF shall not be permitted.

Procedure to drawdown funds under the ILF

5. The CBSL will provide funds under the ILF only to the extent of the value of the Eligible Securities available in the ILF account of the DDP at a given time. The value of Eligible Securities, calculated based on the Official Prices determined by the CBSL for such purpose, will be credited to each DDP’s Settlement Account in the RTGS.

6. Eligible Securities available in the ILF account of the DDP at the end of the previous business day will be automatically transferred to the CBSL’s ILF account at the time of opening of the System for business.

7. DDPs may carry out multiple ILF drawdowns and repayments at their discretion within a business day, as and when an Intra-day liquidity requirement arises, by initiating a request through the System. DDP, who wishes to obtain funds under the ILF, shall reposition a sufficient quantity of Eligible Securities in its ILF account in the LankaSecure in order to avail the ILF.

Official Prices of Securities

8. The Official Prices of Eligible Securities shall be determined by the CBSL on a daily basis, based on the latest available current market prices and market developments. A haircut is applied in arriving at the Official Prices, depending on the type of the security and tenor. Such Official Prices are recorded in the LankaSecure System and in the Online Electronic Bidding System (OEBS) used for Open Market Operations (OMO).

Settlement of funds obtained under the ILF at the end of the business day

9. DDPs may return the funds borrowed under the ILF fully or partially and regain whole or part of the securities used as collateral before the time specified for repayment of funds borrowed under the ILF in the daily operating schedule issued in terms of the System Rules.

10. All outstanding ILF balances should be settled by the DDPs before the close of business as specified in the daily operating schedule, issued in terms of the System Rules. For this purpose, DDPs must ensure that sufficient funds are available in their Settlement Accounts in the RTGS at the time of reversal of ILF balances to enable the CBSL to recover any outstanding ILF balances.

Part III - 39

11. The process of recovery of outstanding ILF balances is initiated through the system at the time specified for the same in the daily operating schedule issued in terms of the System Rules. A settlement request will be submitted to RTGS on Delivery vs Payment (DVP) terms, which will transfer securities from the CBSL’s ILF Account to the ILF Account of the DDP, subject to availability of funds in the respective RTGS account. The reversal of ILF balances will be done at the original price and the original transaction value.

Default of funds borrowed under the ILF

12. If a DDP fails, for any reason whatsoever, to settle in full to the CBSL, the amount outstanding under the ILF at the time specified in clause 10 above, the DDP shall be deemed to be in default for the full sum so outstanding and shall become liable to pay default interest as set out in clause 16 below. Such default interest shall be debited to the DDPs Settlement account with the CBSL on the next business day.

13. Where a DDP is deemed to be in default as set out above, such DDP should repay in full, the amount in default and the default interest before the close of business on the next business day.

14. The system will revalue the securities in the custody of the CBSL and generate the reversal payment amount on the next business day based on the official prices relevant for the next business day. If the revalued amount is higher than the total amount of default and default interest, the CBSL will repay the excess amount to the credit of the DDP’s settlement account in the RTGS. If the revalued amount is lower than the total amount of default and the default interest, the CBSL will charge the difference by debiting the DDP’s settlement account in the RTGS.

15. The DDP should ensure the availability of sufficient funds in its Settlement Account in the RTGS for the repayment of the revalued amount in default and the default interest on or before the close of business on the next business day. In the event the DDP fails to settle the amount set out above before the end of business on the next business day, the CBSL shall retain the securities against which such funds were provided and deal with them as the CBSL deems fit.

16. On the first occasion of default of ILF, a DDP shall be charged default interest at a rate of 5 per cent per month or part thereof. On each succeeding occasion of default during a calendar year, such default interest rate shall be increased by 100 basis points, provided that where such default occurs more than once within a 30 day period from the preceding default, the CBSL shall have the right to retain the securities against which ILF was granted and to deal with them as the CBSL deems fit, in addition to the right to charge default interest as stipulated in this clause. In the event of repeated default, the CBSL may withdraw the availability of the ILF to the DDP for a period of time determined by the CBSL.

17. Notwithstanding the other provisions of the ILF agreement or Operating Instructions and notwithstanding the fact that default has not occurred more than once within the preceding 30-day period, the CBSL may, at its sole discretion, taking into consideration the circumstances of a default, decide to retain the securities, and to deal with them as the CBSL deems fit.

18. As set out in clause 2 above, if a DDP is found to have used third party securities for availing of ILF, such DDP will be considered to have violated both the System Rules and these OI. Following payments specified in the said rules shall be imposed for such violations.

Table 1: Payments for violation of rules relating to the ILF

Amount borrowed against third party securities (Rs. million)Rates charged per day (%)

Up to 1,0002.0

Above 1,0002.5

19. Notwithstanding the other provisions of these OI, the CBSL may at its sole discretion, taking into consideration the circumstances of a default or use of third-party securities, withdraw the availability of the ILF to a DDP permanently or for a period of time determined by the CBSL.

20. Operating Instructions issued in terms of circular captioned ‘Operating Instructions on provision of Intra-Day Liquidity Facility (ILF) Against Scripless Government Securities on LankaSettle’ bearing no. 35/01/005/0006/36, dated 12 April 2018, are hereby rescinded.

21. In the event of any discrepancy between these operating instructions and the ILF agreement, the ILF agreement prevails.

Provision of Efficient Banking Services to Sri Lankan Expatriates

Considering the current economic state of the country, it is of utmost importance to attract foreign exchange to Sri Lanka while adhering to the national laws and rules, regulations, circulars and directives issued under such laws.

It has come to our notice that complaints have been received by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and by the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) on the difficulties faced by Sri Lankan expatriates when opening accounts from overseas and making fund transfers through accounts maintained with Licensed Commercial Banks and Licensed Specialised Banks.

Many of the complaints referred to;

1. Unreasonable length of time taken to complete the services offered by the staff,

2. Delays and long duration taken to credit funds to relevant local accounts when executed from overseas,

3. Bank staff misinterpreting the CBSL /FIU circulars and misinforming the customers.

Much of these complaints were concentrated on the conduct of branches at regional and outstations.

Accordingly, your attention is drawn to streamline the processes of attracting remittances by regional and outstation branches.

Policy Package to Support Greater Macroeconomic Stability:Allowing Flexibility in the Exchange Rate

The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has decided on 07 March 2022 to allow greater flexibility in the exchange rate with immediate effect, and the Central Bank is of the view that foreign exchange transactions would take place at levels which are not more than Rs. 230.00 per US dollar and the equivalent cross currency rates. In light of the above decision of the Monetary Board, the formally agreed exchange rate range as requested by then Governor on 06 September 2021 will not be applicable from 08 March 2022 onwards.

As greater flexibility in the exchange rate is now allowed, effective from 09/03/2022, the Central Bank will discontinue the incentive of Rs. 8.00 per US dollar offered by the Central Bank on the conversion of workers’ remittances and the incentive of Rs. 10.00 per US dollar on the conversion of foreign currency notes held in hand, as per the Operating Instructions issued on the “Additional Incentive Scheme on Inward Workers’ Remittances” and “Incentives for General Public for Depositing, Converting and Investing of Foreign Currency”, respectively.

The requirement of the sale of 25% of converted workers’ remittances and mandatorily converted export proceeds by Banks to the Central Bank will continue.

The recent decision of the Government to provide a new incentive to expatriate workers who convert remittances would be clarified by the Government in due course.

In accordance with the Operating Instructions (Ols) issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to Licensed Banks (LBs) on 27 December 2021, all LBs have been selling foreign exchange (FX) to the CBSL, on a weekly basis, in US dollars of twenty-five per centum (25%) of inward workers’ remittances (received in various currencies), which are converted into Sri Lankan rupees (LKR) and the residual of export proceeds, which is mandatory to convert into LKR. These FX purchases have supported the CBSL to provide FX required to finance essential imports of the country.

In this regard, taking recent developments into consideration as well as the need to further improve the foreign reserves of the country and to ensure the uninterrupted supply of essential imports, (particularly, fuel, gas, coal and medicine) the CBSL hereby directs all LBs to sell to the CBSL, on a weekly basis, in US dollars, fifty per centum (50%) of inward workers’ remittances (received in various currencies), which are converted into LKR and the residual of export proceeds, which is mandatory to convert into LKR, from the week commencing from 21.03.2022, until the week ending on 29.07.2022.

Other requirements specified in previously issued OIs on the above schemes shall remain unchanged.

Operating Instructions on Managing Intraday Volatility of the Exchange Rate

Considering the prevailing condition in the domestic foreign exchange (FX) market and excessive volatility in the exchange rate, the Monetary Board has decided to introduce following measures to facilitate orderly behaviour of foreign exchange market/exchange rate.

Accordingly, all Licensed Banks (LBs) are hereby informed that, with effect from 13 May 2022, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) will announce a middle rate of the USD/LKR exchange rate applicable for interbank transactions, based on the previous day’s weighted average spot exchange rate prevailed in the interbank market. Further, the CBSL will also announce the permitted USD/LKR variation margin on a daily basis, before opening of the market. The rates applicable to other currencies shall be determined by LBs based on the announced USD/LKR rate and the variation margin.

The variation margin of the intraday exchange rate of the interbank market shall be within the permitted range and shall be applied as plus or minus of the weighted average interbank USD/LKR spot exchange rate announced.

This Direction may be cited as the General Direction on Sri Lanka Interbank Payment System No. 01 of 2022 and shall replace the General Direction on Sri Lanka Interbank Payment System No. 01/2011. This Direction shall apply to LankaClear (Pvt) Ltd. (LCPL) and the participants of the Sri Lanka Interbank Payment System (SLIPS) and shall come into operation on 28 February 2022.

Introduction

SLIPS is an electronic system which processes payment orders to facilitate money transactions. SLIPS was introduced by the CBSL in 1993 as an off-line Interbank Payment System. In 2002, the CBSL divested the clearing operations of Cheques and SLIPS to LCPL. The objectives of the SLIPS are to establish a uniform and common electronic retail payment system and to promote payment system safety and efficiency while promoting cooperation among all SLIPS participants in the evolution of the country’s retail payment systems. SLIPS was upgraded to an on-line Interbank Payment System by LCPL in September 2010 to facilitate settlement of transactions on the same business day.
