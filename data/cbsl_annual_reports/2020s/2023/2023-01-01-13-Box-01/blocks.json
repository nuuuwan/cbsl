    "text": "High inflation during 2022 was a global phenomenon. Global inflation accelerated to 8.8 per cent in 2022 (IMF, 2023) reflecting the impact of the lagged effects of ultra easy monetary and fiscal support following the COVID-19 pandemic, shortages of fuel and nonfuel commodities, exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine War and capacity constraints along with supply chain issues. Affected by global as well as domestic factors, Sri Lanka also experienced inflation at unprecedented levels in the year 2022, recording the largest increase in price levels in its history since independence. However, in late 2022, inflation started moderating from its peak levels, showing early signs of a disinflation process. This process is expected to be supported by several factors, eventually bringing inflation down to the targeted levels in the period ahead. Against this backdrop, it is important to understand the concepts of inflation, disinflation and the characteristics of past global disinflation episodes, and more importantly, the envisaged disinflation process of Sri Lanka, as various misconceptions and misinterpretations have come to the fore resulting in confusion and affecting inflation expectations of the public.",

    "text": "A change in inflation is sometimes misinterpreted as a corresponding change in the price level. The general price level represents an average of all prices in the economy as measured by a consumer price index. The most commonly used measures of the level of prices in Sri Lanka are the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) and the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI). In contrast, inflation is the rate at which the general price level increases over time, which is typically denoted as the percentage change in a consumer price index between two periods. Therefore, a decline in inflation compared to the previous period may not necessarily mean a drop in the general price level, but rather a reduction in the pace of increase in the general price level.",

The figure illustrates that the year-on-year inflation in a given month (e.g., Dec. 2022) depends upon the consumer price index in the corresponding month and the value of the same 12 months earlier (i.e., Dec. 2021).",

Domestic inflation is affected by demand side factors, supply side factors, and the economic agent\u2019s expectations on the future course of inflation. Demand side factors are typically the outcomes of a growing economy, public expectations of future price movements, and macroeconomic policies (i.e., monetary policy and fiscal policy) aimed at influencing the aggregate demand conditions of the economy, whereas supply side factors could be the outcomes of either the supply side policies of the Government or some exogenous circumstances, such as natural disasters, global events, etc. As the people of Sri Lanka consume a considerable share of imported items, the country\u2019s inflation is also affected by the movements in global commodity prices. In addition, exchange rate movements affect inflation. For instance, a depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee against the US dollar (since most imports are valued in US dollar terms) will increase the price of imports in domestic currency terms.",

Alternatively, it can be defined as a sustained decrease in year-on-year inflation. Disinflation is a process that typically takes place over the short to medium term until inflation reaches the desired level and price stability is restored. It is important to note that disinflation, following an episode of high inflation, is different from deflation, which refers to a sustained decrease in the general price level. Disinflation results in a lower level of inflation where the prices are still rising, but at a slower rate.",

The objective of contractionary monetary policy is to bring back inflation to the targeted level and sustain it thereafter. Disinflation policies could be associated with short term costs in terms of subdued economic activity and rising unemployment. However, the long term gains for the economy on account of reduced distortions due to high inflation outweigh the short term costs. In the meantime, policymakers must also be vigilant of threats of future deflation during disinflation episodes, as sustained deflation can be highly destructive to a modern economy (Bernanke, 2012).",

The reduction in inflation in the US in the early 1980s, when the US Federal Reserve was headed by Paul Volcker, remains a widely discussed macroeconomic outcome (commonly referred to as \u2018Volcker disinflation\u2019). During the 1970s and early 1980, the general price levels in the US rose significantly. However, following the implementation of aggressive monetary policy measures by the US Federal Reserve, the annual inflation rate was brought down from a peak of 13.5 per cent in 1980 to 3.2 per cent by 1983. The US experienced two recessions during this period, which are generally attributed to disinflationary policies. However, \u2018Volcker disinflation\u2019 laid the foundation for the long economic expansions of the 1980s and 1990s in the US. In the meantime, Japan and Germany also experienced heightened levels of inflation in the early 1970s. However, by the late 1970s both countries recorded low inflation relative to other advanced economies. The success of this disinflation process is attributed to the strong discipline of the respective governments and monetary authorities, based on the understanding that inflation in the long run is a",

The IMF (2023) expects global inflation to fall in 2023 and 2024. If the envisaged moderation in global commodity prices is passed on to domestic prices via timely and transparent adjustments, the price momentum of imported inflation could be kept at a considerably low level in 2023. Furthermore, the stability of the exchange rate amidst an improved Balance of Payments (BOP) position would be helpful in this regard. The recent appreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee against the US dollar, if continued, could help lower imported inflation and reduce second-round effects associated with these imports, thereby supporting the disinflation process. In the meantime, Sri Lanka\u2019s import prices increased disproportionately during 2022 reflecting the substantial depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee and the increase in global commodity prices. This resulted in large month-on-month increases in prices of imported commodities, particularly around mid-2022. In the year 2023, this will influence imported inflation favourably through a sizeable negative base effect supporting the disinflation path (please see Figure B 1.2). On the other hand, with respect to domestic inflation, the price momentum is estimated to be",

In addition, some improvements were witnessed in domestic supply conditions over the last couple of months. As a result, the price momentum relating to food inflation recorded even negative values in certain months. The improved supply conditions are expected to continue through 2023, supporting the efforts to bring inflation to lower levels. Meanwhile, the adjustments made by the Government on various taxes as well as the revisions made to utility tariffs in 2022 and early 2023, together with their second-round effects, resulted in one-off upward adjustments in the general price level. Moreover, the supply side factors remained considerable in 2022 due to numerous shortages and bottlenecks witnessed in domestic supply conditions associated with the BOP crisis. The month-on-month increases in domestic prices in 2022 due to supply bottlenecks as well as tax and tariff revisions will influence inflation favourably in 2023 via a sizeable base effect (please see Figure B 1.2). Therefore, the moderation in domestic inflation in the period ahead is expected to be supported by a combination of subdued price momentum and a considerable base effect. The overall inflation of the country, which is an outcome of the expected dynamics of both imported and domestic inflation, along with the improving supply conditions, among others, is envisaged to reduce sustainably in 2023, enabling the realisation of the anticipated disinflation path.",
