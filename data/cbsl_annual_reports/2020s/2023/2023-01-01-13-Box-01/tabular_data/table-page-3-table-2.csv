The Envisaged Disinflation Process in Sri Lanka 
Sri 
Lanka’s 
inflation 
started  moderating 
from 
its 
-30
peak 
levels  of  around  70  per  cent 
(year-on-year) 
in  September  2022,  confirming 
that 
the  disinflation 
 
process had started as envisaged. In terms of economic 
factors,  this  process  is  expected  to  be  supported  by 
subdued  aggregate  demand  conditions  due  to  tight 
monetary  and  fiscal  policies,  expected  improvements 
in domestic supply conditions, improved external sector 
performance, 
normalisation 
of 
global 
commodity 
prices,  and  the  timely  passthrough  of  such  reductions 
to domestic prices. Statistically, the disinflation process 
is anticipated to be influenced by both the momentum 
effect  and  the  base  effect,  with  a  higher  contribution 
expected from the latter. 
Moreover, 
the  effects  of 
statistical 
factors  can  be 
assessed within the context of sources of inflation and 
expected  economic  developments.  The 
IMF 
(2023) 
expects global inflation to fall in 2023 and 2024. If the 
envisaged  moderation  in  global  commodity  prices  is 
passed on to domestic prices via timely and transparent 
adjustments, the price momentum of imported inflation 
could  be  kept  at  a  considerably  low  level  in  2023. 
Furthermore,  the  stability  of  the  exchange  rate  amidst 
an improved Balance of Payments (BOP) position would 
be helpful in this regard. The recent appreciation of the  
Sri Lanka rupee against the US dollar, if continued, could 
help lower imported inflation and reduce second-round 
effects associated with these imports, thereby supporting 
the  disinflation  process.  In  the  meantime,  Sri  Lanka’s 
import prices increased disproportionately during 2022 
reflecting  the  substantial  depreciation  of  the  Sri  Lanka 
rupee  and  the  increase  in  global  commodity  prices. 
This  resulted 
in 
large  month-on-month 
increases 
in 
prices  of  imported  commodities,  particularly  around  
mid-2022. In the year 2023, this will influence imported 
inflation  favourably  through  a  sizeable  negative  base 
effect supporting the disinflation path (please see Figure 
B  1.2).  On  the  other  hand,  with  respect  to  domestic 
inflation, 
the  price  momentum 
is  estimated 
to  be","","",""

significantly low on account of unprecedented monetary 
policy tightening measures and an extremely tight fiscal 
policy  stance.  In  addition,  some  improvements  were 
witnessed  in  domestic  supply  conditions  over  the  last 
couple  of  months.  As  a  result,  the  price  momentum 
relating to food inflation recorded even negative values 
in certain months. The improved supply conditions are 
expected  to  continue  through  2023,  supporting  the 
efforts  to  bring  inflation  to  lower  levels.  Meanwhile, 
the  adjustments  made  by  the  Government  on  various 
taxes  as  well  as  the  revisions  made  to  utility  tariffs  in 
2022 and early 2023, together with their second-round 
effects,  resulted  in  one-off  upward  adjustments  in  the 
general  price  level.  Moreover,  the  supply  side  factors 
remained  considerable 
in  2022  due 
shortages and bottlenecks witnessed in domestic supply 
conditions  associated  with  the  BOP  crisis.  The  month-
on-month increases in domestic prices in 2022 due to 
supply bottlenecks as well as tax and tariff revisions will 
influence  inflation  favourably  in  2023  via  a  sizeable 
base  effect  (please  see  Figure  B  1.2).  Therefore,  the 
moderation in domestic inflation in the period ahead is 
expected to be supported by a combination of subdued 
price  momentum  and  a  considerable  base  effect.  The 
overall inflation of the country, which is an outcome of 
the expected dynamics of both imported and domestic 
inflation,  along  with  the  improving  supply  conditions, 
among  others, 
is  envisaged 
to 
reduce 
in  2023,  enabling  the  realisation  of  the  anticipated 
disinflation path.
