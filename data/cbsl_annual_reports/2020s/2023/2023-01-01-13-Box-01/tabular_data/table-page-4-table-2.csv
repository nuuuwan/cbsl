it","","","","the anchoring of medium term inflation expectations in 
line with the Central Bank’s inflation target.  
Frequent  communication  of 
the  estimated 
short 
to 
medium term inflation path remains a key element of the 
disinflation process. Towards this end, the Central Bank 
will  continue  to  publish  its  inflation  fan  chart  in  press 
releases following regular monetary policy reviews and 
in other communiqués as appropriate. Any discrepancy 
between  the  medium  term  inflation  forecast  and  the 
inflation  target  prompts  policy  measures  to  close  the 
gap.  Frequent  and  transparent  communication  of  the 
inflation  path  would  also  serve  as  a  mechanism  to 
ensure  commitment  from  the  Central  Bank  to  restore 
and maintain price stability.
Further, the Central Bank will commence publishing a 
forward  looking  semi-annual  monetary  policy  report 
from  the  second  half  of  2023.  This  report  will  mainly 
display  medium  term  projections  for  inflation  and  the 
underlying  factors  for  the  projections  as  well  as  an 
explanation of the deviation of actual inflation from the 
published forecast, if any. 
A key factor for the disinflation process is the credibility 
of the central bank, as discussed above. This will help 
anchor 
inflation  expectations.  The  credibility  of 
the 
Central  Bank  is  highly  related  to  the  independence  of 
the  Bank.  In  this  regard,  the  envisaged  enactment  of 
the  new  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  Act  will  contribute 
immensely 
to 
improving 
the 
independence 
and 
credibility of the Central Bank, which in turn will support 
the  current  disinflation  episode  and  further  strengthen 
the anchoring of inflation expectations.

The  Role  of  Inflation  Expectations  and  Inflation 
The disinflation process of the country is also expected 
to be reinforced by well-anchored inflation expectations. 
Inflation  expectations 
stakeholders in an economy expect prices to change in 
the future. Inflation expectations matter because actual 
inflation  depends,  in  part,  on  what  the  public  expects 
to  be,  as  expectations  could
