"Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year
Part III"
"9.4  When a loan is in arrears, the Branch Manager of PFI should take immediate recovery actions with a view to persuade"
"the borrower to repay the loan promptly.  The actions that can be followed under the scheme are as follows:"
"(i)  
Visit the borrower (minimum of 2 visits) to ascertain the reasons for the non-payments and persuade him to repay the"
"dues."
"(ii)  Ascertain and examine the difficulties faced by the borrower and recommend to the borrower a course of actions to"
"be followed by him to overcome such difficulties."
"(iii)  Where the difficulties are bona fide and beyond the control of the farmer, reschedule the loan and give the borrower"
"a new repayment plan considering the income pattern of the borrower;"
"(iv) 
In the case of a willful borrower, issue a notice of demand on the borrower and the guarantors."
"(v)  Where it is found that the loan proceeds have been misused, the notice of demand should be issued forthwith and"
"steps should be taken immediately to institute legal action against such borrowers."
