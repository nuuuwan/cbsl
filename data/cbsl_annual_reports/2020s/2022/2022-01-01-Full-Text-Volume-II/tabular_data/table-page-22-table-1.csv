The Bank used judgements when assessing of the business 
model  within  which  the  assets  are  held  and  whether  the 
contractual terms of the financial assets are solely-payment-
of-principal-and-interest (SPPI) on the principal amount of 
the  outstanding.  The  Bank  also  used  judgements  when 
establishing the criteria for determining whether credit risk 
on the financial assets has increased significantly since initial 
recognition,  determining  methodology  for  incorporating 
forward looking information into measurement of Expected 
Credit Losses (ECL) and selection and approval of models 
to measure ECL. The implications of COVID-19 on the use 
of estimates and judgments in the computation of Bank’s 
expected credit losses are explained in Note 3.4.
