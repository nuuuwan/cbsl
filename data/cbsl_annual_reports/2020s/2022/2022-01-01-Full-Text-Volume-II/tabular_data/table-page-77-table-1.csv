50.5 Financial Instruments not measured at Fair Value
Valuation Method
The  following  table  sets  out  the  financial  instruments 
Land is valued using market approach with direct comparison 
method, whereby assets are compared to recent sales with 
Carrying Amount
Fair Value
no  added  or  nominal  added  improvement  value,  making 
adjustments for points of difference to derive the fair value.
Depreciated  Current  Replacement  Cost  (DRC)  method  is 
used  in  valuing  all  the  buildings  except  Central  Point  and 
Foreign Currency 
White  Aways  considering  that  the  assets  controlled  by  the 
Financial Assets
public sector entities that provide services to the community 
Cash and Cash 
are not traded on an open liquid market.
Equivalents
IMF Related Assets
Income approach is used to value the other buildings which 
values the property based on estimated future income, profits 
or  cash  flow  that  are  converted  (discounted)  to  a  single 
current amount.
Under the Market Approach, estimated fair value would get 
increased/(decreased) if; 
Price per perch would get higher/(lower)
Price per square foot would get higher/(lower)
Depreciation rate for building would get lower/(higher)
Under  Income  Approach,  estimated  fair  value  would  get 
increased/(decreased) if;
Gross annual rentals would get higher/(lower)
Years purchase would get higher/(lower)
Derivatives
Derivative valuation models use forward prices (calculated 
by extrapolating the forward points available in the market) 
and discount rates calculated based on zero coupon yield 
curves  of  the  respective  currencies  as  of  the  valuation 
date.  If  the  instrument  that  is  valued  contains  a  margin, 
adjustments  are  made  to  the  forward  prices  and/or  the 
interest rates to represent the impact of the margin rate. 
50.2 Repurchase and Resale Agreements
The reported value of repurchase and resale agreements 
is considered to approximate their fair value due to short 
term nature of the agreements. The carrying value of the 
provided  Standing  Deposit  Facility  as  at  31  December 
2021 was Rs. 101,062.88 Mn (2020 - Rs. 209,507.90 
Mn)  and  the  carrying  value  of  Sri  Lanka  Government 
Securities  purchased  under  resale  agreements  as  at  31

2,728.41  Mn).  There  was  no  outstanding  balance  of 
Sri  Lanka  Government  Securities  sold  under  repurchase 
agreements as at 31 December 2021 (2020 – Nil).
