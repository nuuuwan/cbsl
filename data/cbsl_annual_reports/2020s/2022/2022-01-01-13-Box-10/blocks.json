Many countries use financial inclusion as an effort to promote a level playing field for individuals and businesses to work towards elevating themselves out of poverty and contribute to sustainable economic growth. Increasing access to financial services and products for those who are excluded from the financial sector enables them to plan and better manage their finances, while opening up opportunities for better standards of living. Access to finance for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) encourages them to invest in new and more productive business activities, contributing to economic growth while generating employment opportunities. Although, financial inclusion alone cannot elevate people out of poverty, it helps to promote building better lives. Further, the importance of financial inclusion is now widely recognized in building a strong foundation of a country\u2019s financial stability, which in turn will facilitate inclusive economic development. In this regard, upgrading financial inclusion concepts and efforts to the policy platforms requires assessment and quantification of level of financial inclusion and careful scrutinisation of the actual requirements of the economy and the individuals.",

Sri Lanka also enjoys high level of bank branch penetration, with bank branch density of 16.4 branches per 100,000 adults as of December 2021.4 However, in contrast to the high literacy level (92.9%5) among the Sri Lankans, the low level of financial literacy (35%6) has been recognized among certain pockets as an impediment to the universal achievements.",

The data collected through the survey will be used to assess the level of financial literacy among Sri Lankans. The survey has been designed according to standard financial literacy score system recognized internationally under three key elements of financial knowledge, financial behavior and financial attitudes. Considering the importance of moving towards a single direction, a coordination mechanism is being developed to improve synergies across all the stakeholder entities conducting financial literacy programmes and MSME support programmes. Going beyond, the proposed Financial Literacy and Capacity Building Road Map will set out the strategic direction and principles for development and implementation of financial education and MSME support programmes.",
