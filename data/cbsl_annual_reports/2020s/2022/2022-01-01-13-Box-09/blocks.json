These shifts in preferences have forced businesses to rewire their infrastructure to be predominantly hybrid (Sadun, Simcoe, & Conti, 2021; Nugent, 2021). Further, the increased consumer preferences towards digital services and online shopping have pushed many businesses in the service sector such as supermarkets, retail, fashion, and entertainment to bring their businesses mobile-first. This phenomenon was also apparent in the local context such as increasing demand for online retail shopping, video consultations for doctors, online learning and tuition service providers and reduced demand for cinemas, large wedding receptions, concerts, exhibitions, and events.

Even for those who were repaying promptly, the probability of default in the future increased significantly, due to the increasing uncertainty in the global economy. This significantly impacted the asset quality of FIs. Liquidity positions of FIs also tightened as borrowers delayed their repayments and depositors withdrew their monies more often.
