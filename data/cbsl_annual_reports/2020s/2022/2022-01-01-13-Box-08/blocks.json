    "text": "Central banks are concerned about maintaining low and stable inflation, i.e., price stability, which is their prime objective. By design, monetary policy is biased towards acting to arrest excessive inflation and hence protecting the purchasing power of the public, particularly the poor, as inflation disproportionately harms low income and fixed income earners. With concerted policy efforts and continuous improvements to monetary policymaking, including the adoption of an inflation targeting framework, global inflation witnessed a clear downward trend in the last several decades. However, frequent high inflation episodes were witnessed globally as well as domestically due to several reasons. Having a comprehensive analysis of such recent events is vital for appropriate policy responses, which would be beneficial in encountering such episodes in the future and mitigating adverse implications.",

This is referred to as the beginning of \u201cThe Great Inflation\u201d and resulted in the collapse of the Bretton Woods Agreement1 by the early 1970s, along with the suspension of dollar convertibility to gold by the authorities of the United States. However, extended by the oil price surge in 1973 with the formation of an embargo by the Organisation of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC), global median consumer price inflation peaked in 1974. Advanced economies responded to the price shock by monetary policy tightening and as a result, inflation tended to decline only in mid-1980s as policy transmission was disturbed by another surge in oil prices in the early 1980s, which was caused by the Iranian Revolution and subsequent Iran-Iraq War. Accordingly, median consumer price inflation in advanced economies, which was at double digit levels in 1974 declined to lower single digits by 1986 and assured the central bank credibility even amidst threats of deep recessions. This was reflected in the quadrupled interest rates in the United States within the five years from 1976 to 1981, which in turn resulted in a sharp contraction of the output between early 1981 and 1982. Some advanced economies in Europe also responded to this peak in inflation in a more stringent manner. The success of this containment of inflation during the period known as \u201cThe Great Moderation\u201d is greatly attributed to the stabilisation of the macroeconomy through policy measures. It was characteristic for most of the countries who witnessed high inflation to adopt inflation targeting as their policy framework, resulting in global disinflation with lesser volatility. However, emerging markets and developing economies, and low income countries experienced a delayed correction of the high inflation rates which in general started in the mid-1990s. This was mostly due to structural issues in their economies such as the populist political culture, persistent and substantial fiscal and current account deficits, which sometimes existed in parallel to fixed exchange rate regimes, deteriorating terms of trade for commodity exporters, and supply side issues compared to industrial economies. Efforts to contain inflation in these economies also resulted in serious output losses during the period from 1989 to 1994, amidst civil wars, in some cases.",

Strong demand persistently pushed energy prices and food prices upward until they collapsed with the financial crisis. The energy price surge was mostly driven by sluggish supply performances where the production and distribution capacity were slow to build-up as a response to rapidly increasing demand. Food prices also contributed to the prevailing high inflation, alongside demand from emerging and developing economies, and a number of other factors, including unfavourable weather conditions and growing use of export restrictions by food exporters, such as export restraints implemented by major grain exporting countries, including China, Ukraine, and Argentina.",

The resultant tight global financial conditions are anticipated to contain global inflation back to the desired level with a policy lag. In addition to demand side measures, some countries are seeking possibilities of implementing certain supply side measures, such as change in conventional agricultural practices expecting to maintain realistic buffer stocks and revising import policies to avoid price rises of essential commodities.",

Central banks increase policy interest rates to increase the cost of borrowings and thereby discourage aggregate consumer spending. On the fiscal front, governments reduce inflationary pressures by increasing taxes and reducing government spending to address the demand-pull inflation. Also, price controls and subsidies play a major role in minimising the cost of production in controlling cost push inflation.",

Numerous assessments on the impact of central bank independence on macroeconomic stability support the assertion of a negative relationship between the central bank independence and inflation (Brumm 2002, 2011; Garriga and Rodriquez 2020; Berger, de Haan, and Eijffinger 2001). Empirically, central bank transparency has also been found to help anchor inflation expectations in advanced economies, thereby stabilising inflation and reducing uncertainty in inflation. (Weber 2016). Overall, appropriate stabilisation policies such as strengthening institutions, greater autonomy in central banking, and establishing an appropriate fiscal environment help decelerate structurally persistent inflation. Moreover, such policy commitments have been instrumental in successfully handling intermittent",

Therefore, it is a significant challenge for central banks in these countries to achieve low and stable inflation and to anchor inflation expectations. Although inflation in developing countries is more susceptible to external shocks such as energy prices and food prices, some of the reasons adduced for the sustained and persistent inflation rates in many developing countries are structural, including high budget deficits and financing such deficits by the central bank, high government expenditure, high military expenditure, low productivity, frequent weather shocks, high persistent inflation expectations by the economic agents, excess money supply and unstable exchange rates.",

Sri Lanka, too experienced, high inflation episodes during several periods due to transitory supply side disruptions, especially weather related, and surge in international commodity prices together with the lagged effect of monetary expansion largely to support deficit financing. Nevertheless, Sri Lanka maintained low and stable levels of inflation for over a decade, abetted by continuous improvements to policy formulation and policy communication, while addressing supply concerns temporarily through government intervention by reducing certain taxes on essential commodities, importation of certain commodities, imposing maximum retail prices for certain commodities, even within the limited fiscal space. The Central Bank has deployed monetary policy measures to contain demand driven inflationary pressures. Adopting a flexible inflation targeting (FIT) monetary policy framework aids the Central Bank to conduct monetary policy in an increasingly forward looking manner with the aim of maintaining inflation at low and stable levels in the medium term, thereby supporting to attain sustainable economic growth while ensuring Central Bank transparency and accountability. Since FIT involves the aim of achieving the envisaged inflation targets, which can be closely monitored through inflation forecasts, the monetary policy decision making process is facilitated by a forward looking model based comprehensive analysis on the deviations of the inflation forecasts from the desired targets. Therefore, shocks to such deviations can be addressed through proactive policy measures in a timely manner to bring inflation back to the desired target levels, while properly anchoring inflation expectations.",

The removal of price controls and their spillover effects and the buildup of demand driven inflationary pressures stemming from pandemic related policy stimulus measures also contributed to inflation. Reflecting growing pressures from underlying demand conditions, core inflation, which does not capture volatile food prices, energy and transport costs, witnessed an increasing trend similar to other countries. Such demand driven pressures are taken care of through proactive policy measures taken by the Central Bank and the policy communication to reiterate commitment to revert inflation to the targeted range at the earliest. As such, the Central Bank increased policy rates in an aggressive manner, while devising preemptive policies to ensure that inflation returns to the targeted level at the fastest possible pace with minimal disruptions to economic recovery. Nonetheless, the government\u2019s intervention also remains vital to overwhelm the supply side concerns, while enabling monetary policy driven measures to arrest excessive inflationary pressure in the economy, and hence robust and coordinated policies are required to be adopted in a timely manner. The intervention of the Central Bank is vital to contain inflationary pressures building up from speculation by economic agents, and hence inflation expectations. It is important to have a mechanism established by the government, to detect early and take proactive policy decisions to contain any adverse inflationary developments arising from supply side disturbances. Such a policy mix is crucial for any country that wishes to quickly move back to targets to enjoy the luxury of stable and healthy levels of inflation, thereby ensuring sustainable economic growth which ensures high living standards of the public.",
