"The  downward  trend  in  global  inflation  discontinued 
for  a  while  in  the  early  2000s  until  economies  were 
heading 
towards 
the  Global  Financial  Crisis,  when 
global energy prices and food prices were soaring. This 
was  particularly  due  to  rapid  growth  in  emerging  and 
developing economies that relied mostly on commodity-
intensive economic growth. Strong demand persistently 
pushed energy prices and food prices upward until they 
collapsed with the financial crisis. The energy price surge 
was  mostly  driven  by  sluggish  supply  performances 
where  the  production  and  distribution  capacity  were 
slow  to  build-up  as  a  response  to  rapidly  increasing 
demand. Food prices also contributed to the prevailing 
high  inflation,  alongside  demand  from  emerging  and 
developing economies, and a number of other factors, 
including unfavourable weather conditions and growing 
use  of  export  restrictions  by  food  exporters,  such  as 
export restraints implemented by major grain exporting 
countries, including China, Ukraine, and Argentina. 
However, in aftermath of the crisis, inflation reached low 
levels, where the global annual average median inflation 
reached 2.6 per cent by 2017. Particularly, about half 
of the advanced economies reported negative inflation 
rates  in  2015,  and  every  three  out  of  four  advanced 
economies  reported  low  single  digit  inflation  (Jongrim 
Ha et al., 2019). In emerging markets and developing","","","","","","","economies, including those that were practicing inflation 
targeting,  disinflation  was  prominent,  and  every  three 
out of five economies recorded inflation rates below the 
target level.","",""

factors in combination. Supply side disruptions to major 
commodities, including energy related and agricultural 
commodities, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, supply 
chain issues, shortage of labour and increased demand 
for  goods  and  services  arising  from  normalisation  of 
activity  from  the  pandemic  are  the  key  contributors  to 
this  episode.  Geopolitical 
Ukraine war since late February 2022 pushed inflation 
trajectories further up on multiple fronts stemming from 
uncertainty, and commodity price hikes also contributed 
to inflation.
