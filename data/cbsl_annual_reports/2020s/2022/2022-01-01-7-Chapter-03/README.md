3.1 OverviewT

he economic and social infrastructure base of the country continued to facilitate the continuity of

economic activity while ensuring the socioeconomic well-being of the people amidst the prolonging

COVID-19 pandemic, with the emergence of new variants. A key challenge during 2021 was the

soaring prices of energy commodities in global markets, driven by the recovery in world demand and limited

increases in supply; this price trend continues to worsen with the geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe.

Accordingly, although the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation undertook two rounds of price revisions in 2021,

these were insufficient in the wake of further increases in global prices as well as the sharp depreciation of the

rupee in early 2022. This led to another sharp price adjustment in the early part of 2022. The financial status

of key State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs) in the energy sector continued to remain disconcerting

in the absence of cost-reflective adjustments to prices and tariffs in a timely manner. The long standing

financial issues of these SOBEs and the dearth of foreign exchange inflows have culminated in an energy

crisis in the country posing a substantial dampening effect on overall activity as the economy strives to reset

in the post COVID-19 era. Recognising the importance of investments in the socioeconomic infrastructure

base of the economy, the Government continued to undertake initiatives focused at improving rural-urban

linkages and the quality of living spaces. Milestones during the year include the enactments of legislation

relating to the Colombo Port City project and the exploration of Petroleum resources, the opening of the

first waste-to-energy plant in Kerawalapitiya and the opening of the New Kelani Bridge followed by the

opening of another section of the Central Expressway in January 2022. Amid these physical infrastructure

developments, the Government also remained committed to the provision of healthcare and education

services, which are expected to have played a large role in mitigating short-term and long-term impacts of

the COVID-19 pandemic on the population. Since the onset of the pandemic, the health sector has been

at the helm of containing the spread of COVID-19 through the provision of not only testing, treatment and

quarantining facilities but also importantly, the timely deployment of the COVID-19 vaccine and booster

doses, amidst the challenges of non-communicable and other communicable diseases, such as Dengue.

While the education sector seemed to have adapted to the ‘new normal’ of online education, facilitated

by the telecommunications sector of the country, concerns remain about the quality of learning outcomes

especially among rural and estate households whose ownership of technological devices and related

literacy levels are low and also among those located in peripheral areas with poor internet connectivity.

For the second consecutive year, amid fiscal constraints, the Government paid allowances and provided

relief measures to households and individuals rendered vulnerable by the COVID-19 pandemic. Poverty

related statistics highlight that the prolonging of the pandemic and the disruptions that it has entailed are

likely to have created a ‘new poor’ segment of the population who remain at the brink of poverty and are

more prone to scarring in the wake of any further disruptions to economic activity stemming from COVID-19

or otherwise. While investments in the economic and social infrastructure base of the country may be

challenging within a limited fiscal space, it must be recognised that the investments made by successive

governments over several decades have enabled Sri Lanka to safeguard businesses, households and

individuals, to a large extent, from any scarring effects stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. However,

in order to ensure the efficacy of such investments, it is necessary for the Government to encourage multi-

stakeholder collaborations across the public and private sector to devise forward-looking and holistic policies

and streamlined strategies that focus not only on fixing short-term issues but also on building the productive

potential of the economy in a sustainable manner over the medium-term. This will be essential to enhance

the resilience of the economy to volatilities and shocks, thereby assuring the economy’s sustained progress

onto a high and inclusive growth trajectory.

3.2 Economic Infrastructure Policies, Institutional Framework and Performance

Petroleum

Global crude oil prices rose sharply in

2021, supported by the steady recovery in

global economic growth as well as tight

supply conditions, although some downward

pressures were observed due to resurgences

of COVID-19. Although the average crude oil price

(Brent) stood at US dollars 43.35 per barrel in 2020,

due to the contraction in global demand induced

by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the turnaround in

the global economy and the relaxation of pandemic

related mobility restrictions, the average crude oil

price in international markets rose by 63.3 per cent

to US dollars 70.80 per barrel in 2021. The recovery

in global crude oil prices that began in mid-2020

gained pace and reached pre-pandemic levels by

March 2021 before reaching seven-year highs in

October 2021. The West Texas Intermediate (WTI)

price was also on a rising trend and recorded an

average of US dollars 67.94 per barrel in 2021

compared to US dollars 39.78 per barrel recorded

in 2020. The surge in global crude oil prices was

primarily driven by optimism surrounding the global

recovery process and the resultant rise in global

demand amidst tight global oil supply conditions

maintained by the Organisation of the Petroleum

Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies. Brief

episodes of downward pressures were observed

due to demand concerns stemming from the

resurgence of COVID-19 and the emergence of

new variants of the virus, which compelled the

imposition of temporary lockdowns and mobility

restriction measures. Global crude oil prices

escalated further and briefly reached US dollars

140 per barrel in March 2022 for the first time

since July 2008 following concerns that geopolitical

tensions between Russia and Ukraine could lead

to further tightening of supplies. In line with rising

trends in global crude oil prices, the average price

of crude oil imported by the Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation (CPC) increased by 51.1 per cent to

the average of US dollars 45.57 per barrel recorded

during 2020.

The continuous escalation of global crude oil

prices warranted the Government to increase

the domestic retail prices of key petroleum

products in 2021 after a hiatus of over one and

half years. Accordingly, domestic prices of the

CPC were revised upwards in June and December

2021, followed by a substantial upward revision

in March 2022. The Lanka IOC PLC (LIOC)

also revised domestic retail prices of petroleum

products in three rounds during 2021 followed by

two rounds of revisions in February 2022 followed

by another two rounds of revisions in March 2022.

The revisions undertaken in March 2022 by both

entities were historically high and were undertaken

to reflect the sharp rise in global crude oil prices

and the impact of the depreciation of the rupee in

March 2022. This reiterates the need to urgently

institutionalise a cost reflective pricing mechanism

that improves transparency regarding pricing

among all stakeholders, especially consumers,

which can contribute to the general acceptance of

such revisions. Such a mechanism is also essential

to ensure the financial viability of the CPC in the

medium-term and thereby the safeguarding of

macroeconomic and financial system stability,

although such revisions could lead to transitory

shocks to general price levels in the country. It

must also be reiterated that the current crisis of

lack of continuous supply of fuels to the domestic

market could also be partly attributed to the

absence of forward-looking and dynamic strategic

planning with due consideration to the continuously

evolving developments in the global and domestic

markets. Transparency in relation to both pricing

and procurement processes is a dire need for the

viability and sustainability of the CPC.

The overall sales volumes of petroleum

products in the domestic market declined by 7.7

per cent during the year, driven by contractions

in sales to the power sector. Several economic

activities were allowed to be pursued throughout the

April and August outbreaks of COVID-19 resulting

in a rebound in economic activity during 2021. In

turn, sales volume of the CPC to the transport,

industrial and aviation sectors grew by 10.4 per

cent, 39.5 per cent and 18.6 per cent, respectively.

Meanwhile, the increased reliance on hydropower

generation due to healthy water levels in reservoirs

resulted in the sales of diesel and furnace oil for

power generation registering notable contractions

of 23.2 per cent and 35.9 per cent, respectively,

thereby dampening the overall sales performance

of the CPC.

Refinery output recorded an overall decline

of 24.7 per cent in 2021 due to multiple closures

of the Sapugaskanda refinery. Subsequent to a

closure from mid February 2021 for the purpose

of general maintenance, the refinery was closed

again in November 2021 for three weeks due to

unavailability of crude oil for refinery operations.

Hence, overall crude oil throughput declined by 24.5

per cent, while refinery output of key products such

as diesel, petrol, fuel oil and naphtha contracted

by 31.1 per cent, 24.5 per cent, 22.9 per cent and

31.9 per cent, respectively, during the period under

review. These production gaps were compensated

for through the importation of refined products by

the CPC which had risen by 15.2 per cent during

the year.

Despite notable upward revisions to

domestic petroleum prices, the financial

performance of the CPC worsened further

in 2021. As per unaudited provisional financial

statements, the CPC incurred an operational

loss of Rs. 41.7 billion in 2021 compared to the

operational profit of Rs. 33.9 billion recorded in

the previous year, reflecting the impact of delayed

and inadequate revision of prices in line with the

sharp increase in global crude oil prices. Sales of

petroleum products to the major sectors of transport

and power generation yielded operational losses,

while the aviation and industry sectors generated

operational profits in 2021. The depreciation of the

rupee against the US dollar resulted in a notable

exchange rate variation loss of Rs. 33.2 billion

to the CPC during the year, weighing negatively

on the overall loss (before taxes), which stood

at Rs. 82.2 billion in 2021 in comparison to the

profit of Rs. 2.4 billion recorded in the previous

year. Meanwhile, borrowings of the CPC from

the banking sector increased by Rs. 123.5 billion

to Rs. 505.3 billion in 2021, while deposits with

domestic licensed commercial banks increased by

Rs. 76.2 billion to Rs. 140.1 billion by end 2021.

The CPC’s total outstanding trade receivables from

public corporations increased to Rs. 161.1 billion

in 2021 from Rs. 142.7 billion in 2020, mainly

due to the growing liabilities owed by the Ceylon

Electricity Board (CEB) and SriLankan Airlines.

Accordingly, by end 2021, trade receivables from

the CEB and SriLankan Airlines accounted for

around 90.1 per cent of total trade receivables of

the CPC. The worsening financial position of the

CPC, alongside the dearth of foreign exchange

flows, led to hindrances in timely and cost-efficient

fuel procurement. In January 2022, the Central

Bank intervened to facilitate the distribution of

the financing of essential import bills for fuel

purchases among the licensed banks in proportion

to their foreign exchange flows with the intention

of facilitating the timely procurement of fuel and

reducing the reliance of the CPC on the two state-

owned banks. The Government also secured a

short-term line of credit amounting to US dollars

500 million from the Export-Import Bank of India in

early 2022, specifically for the purchase of refined

petroleum products from India.

There is an urgent need for the CPC to

undertake concerted efforts to ensure the

continuity of supply of petroleum products

in a financially viable manner. The sensitivity

of demand for petroleum products, especially

from the transport sector, to price revisions is

relatively low in Sri Lanka. This can be observed

in the sales volumes of the CPC to the transport

sector standing at 3.6 billion litres in 2021, in

comparison to the average sales volume of

3.4 billion litres during the period from 2015 till

2019. This is further evidenced by the continued

strong demand for petroleum products amid the

historically high price revisions undertaken in

the early part of 2022. With due consideration to

this growing demand for petroleum products, it is

essential that specific initiatives are undertaken

by the Ministry of Energy in close collaboration

with the CPC and other relevant stakeholders in

the electricity and transport sector to identify other

means of demand management for petroleum

products, such as through the expansion of

renewable electricity generation capacity and,

the undertaking of qualitative improvements in

public transportation combined with measures

such as congestion charges or tolls to discourage

the use of private transportation, among others.

The ongoing issues in the energy sector reiterate

that there is a strong need for the CPC to engage

in forward-looking decision making with due

consideration to developments in domestic and

global markets. Whilst the supply disruptions seen

in the recent months are partly stemming from

issues in foreign currency liquidity, the extent of

these supply disruptions could have been reduced

through timely and prudent decisions, undertaken

by the CPC in a concerted manner with the CEB

and other related public stakeholders.

Several infrastructure development

projects aimed at improving the performance

and productivity of the petroleum industry

were carried out during the year, albeit at a

slower pace. The detailed feasibility study for the

establishment of a new refinery in Sapugaskanda

as a Public-Private Partnership under a Built-

Operate-Transfer model with a capacity of

100,000 barrels per day was completed by the

CPC in 2021. Meanwhile, in order to improve the

storage facilities available for petroleum products,

two storage construction projects comprising

total capacity of 93,000m3 in Kolonnawa were

also under progress during the year. The

CPC also commenced the development and

upgrading of the Aviation Refueling Terminal as

a part of the Bandaranaike International Airport

(BIA) development project. In addition, the CPC

continued to work in collaboration with the CEB

to construct the pipeline conveying gas to the

Kelanitissa power plant under the proposed

Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) power project.

Accordingly, land acquisition and evaluation of

project proposals commenced in 2021 and the

project is expected to be completed by 2023.

In early 2022, an agreement was signed for the

Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm Development project

to be carried out in collaboration with the Indian

Oil Corporation (IOC). Accordingly, of the 99 oil

tanks in the Trincomalee Oil Storage Complex, 24

are to be allocated to the CPC and another 61

are to be upgraded by a subsidiary that is to be

established as a joint venture between the CPC

and IOC, while the remaining 14 tanks are to be

developed by the IOC.

The Government continued to engage in

developing a national plan for upstream oil and

gas exploration during 2021. The Petroleum

Resources Act No. 21 of 2021 was enacted in

October 2021 with the primary aim of establishing

an independent, efficient and transparent upstream

legislative framework, thereby creating a clear

national upstream policy and a regulatory and

operational framework to oversee and manage

petroleum resources and related operations.

Following the enactment of the new Petroleum

Resources Act, the Petroleum Development

Authority of Sri Lanka (PDASL) was established in

October 2021 as an independent regulator in lieu of

the Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat

(PRDS). Further, in line with international block

demarcation processes and current trends, a

new offshore hydrocarbon exploration block map

comprising 871 small blocks and three large blocks

covering the Mannar, Cauvery and Lanka Basins,

was devised and gazetted in July 2021. Further,

in line with the National Policy on Natural Gas,

which was gazetted in 2020, initial work relating to

the drafting of the Gas Utilisation Master Plan was

underway began in 2021 and it is expected to be

launched during early 2022 by the PDASL.

Electricity

Electricity demand continued to expand in

line with the recovery in economic activity in

2021. During the year, electricity generation grew

by 6.4 per cent to 16,716 GWh, compared to the

previous year, with increased share of hydropower

generation. Water levels in reservoirs remained

above 60 per cent throughout the year owing to heavy

rainfall in catchment areas, thereby contributing

to the increased reliance on low-cost hydropower

generation to meet electricity demand. Accordingly,

total electricity generation through hydro sources

increased by 44.2 per cent to 5,640 GWh, while the

share of hydropower in total electricity generation

increased to 34 per cent in 2021 from 25 per cent

recorded in 2020. This also resulted in reduced

reliance on fuel oil based power generation which

declined by 37.0 per cent to 2,634 GWh while coal

power generation contracted by 4.1 per cent to 5,519

GWh during the period under review. Meanwhile,

power generation through Non-Conventional

Renewable Energy (NCRE) sources registered a

significant growth of 56.6 per cent to 2,922 GWh,

largely driven by the addition of new renewable

energy plants to the national grid, particularly the 100

MW Mannar wind plant. Accordingly, the shares of

fuel oil, coal, and NCRE power generation in the total

generation mix stood at 16 per cent, 33 per cent, and

17 per cent, respectively. Further, the share of power

generated by the CEB out of total power generation

stood at 76.0 per cent in 2021, while the remainder

was purchased from Independent Power Producers

(IPPs). The overall transmission and distribution

loss as a percentage of total power generation

was maintained at 9.0 per cent in 2021 despite the

expansion of electricity supply to remote and rural

areas. From early 2022, there was a turnaround in the

reliance on hydropower generation due to the rapid

depletion of reservoir water levels amid the onset of

dry weather conditions. Due to the resultant increase

in reliance on thermal-based power generation, the

CEB has been experiencing difficulties in meeting the

energy demand of the economy in the early months

of 2022. Difficulties in fuel procurement caused by

foreign exchange issues within the country amidst

soaring global prices of energy commodities led to

the implementation of load shedding since February

2022.

Electricity sales increased by 6.5 per cent to

15,214 GWh in 2021, owing primarily to the lower

base induced by the reduced demand in 2020.

The overall growth in sales was driven by demand

from all user categories, except for religious and

street lighting purposes. Electricity sales to the

hotel sector, which accounts for 1.4 per cent of

total sales, increased notably by 13.7 per cent in

2021, compared to the sharp decline of 29.2 per

cent observed in 2020, highlighting the recovery

in the tourism sector during the year. Meanwhile,

the CEB continued to face difficulties in manual

meter reading resulting in significant mismatches

between electricity sales and electricity generation

data. Accordingly, the CEB has taken initiatives to

collect accurate and real-time energy data through

remote disconnection and automatic reconnection

facilities. Two commercial scale smart metering

projects were initiated in Dehiwala and Katunayake.

Acceleration of such timely initiatives is essential, as

rapid implementation of smart metering technologies

would ensure smooth billing and collection of dues

in a prompt and efficient manner, thereby improving

the cash flows of the CEB.

Increased reliance on hydropower generation,

combined with a low share of costly fuel oil

based electricity generation helped improve

the financial performance of the CEB during

2021. However, this was insufficient to offset losses

incurred during the year as well as those from the

past. As per unaudited provisional financial data,

the CEB recorded a loss of Rs. 22.0 billion in 2021,

compared to a loss of Rs. 69.2 billion reported in

2020. Short term borrowings of the CEB from banks

and other outstanding liabilities to the CPC and IPPs

increased to Rs. 237.8 billion by end 2021 from

Rs. 208.4 billion recorded by end 2020, while the

CEB’s long term outstanding liabilities increased to

Rs. 502.8 billion by end 2021 from Rs. 483.8 billion

recorded at end 2020. The Government’s decision

to provide a grace period to settle electricity bills

and to defer the disconnecting of services to unpaid

consumers worsened the cash flow position of

the CEB. The CEB's financial performance could

deteriorate further in 2022 on account of revisions to

domestic fuel prices in early 2022 and on prospects

of increases in energy commodity prices during the

remainder of 2022. These developments reiterate

the urgent need to implement a cost reflective

pricing mechanism for electricity tariffs and to

undertake regular revisions especially considering

that electricity tariffs have not been revised since

2014. Initiatives to increase the power generation

capacity through expansion of renewable energy

sources are also essential.

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri

Lanka (PUCSL), the regulatory authority for

the electricity sector, continued to strengthen

its monitoring and regulatory activities in

order to ensure the provision of continuous

power supply. The CEB submitted its Long-Term

Generation Expansion Plan for 2022-2041 (LTGEP)

in October 2021 for the approval of the PUCSL. The

plan outlines that the renewable energy share will

be about 50 per cent of total electricity generation

by 2030. However, the PUCSL requested the

CEB to realign the LTGEP in accordance with

the Government's target of renewable energy

contributing to 70 per cent of electricity generation

by 2030. The PUCSL requested that the amended

LTGEP be submitted by June 2022. In July 2021,

the Cabinet of Ministers decided not to build any

new coal power plants in the near future to ensure

sustainable energy development and to reiterate

its commitment to providing clean energy. The

decision was in line with the commitment made

under the United Nations Framework Convention

on Climate Change to achieve carbon neutrality by

2050. Meanwhile, other monitoring and regulatory

aspects of electricity, such as the development

of a National Electrician Licensing Framework,

inspections of renewable power plants, and

training for electricians and technicians, were

underway during the year.

Activities related to the development of

several power plants were in progress during

the year with the aim of expanding energy

generation to keep pace with the steady growth

in electricity demand. Given the expected

reliance on LNG as one of the main sources of

electricity generation, as per the LTGEP, the

Cabinet of Ministers granted approval for the

construction of Sri Lanka's first LNG power plant at

Kerawalapitiya. Accordingly, construction of the

first 300 MW power plant commenced in March

2021 and is expected to be connected to the

national grid by early 2024, while the second 300

MW plant was at the initial stages of construction

and is expected to be completed by the end of 2024.

The CEB initiated a competitive bidding process

for the construction of LNG terminal facilities

consisting of a Floating Storage Regasification

Unit, on a Build-Own-Operate basis, and a delivery

pipeline, on a Build-Operate-Transfer basis.

These LNG based power plants are expected to

be equipped with dual fuel capability, including

fuel supply and storage arrangements, in order to

ensure continuity of supply in case of disruptions

to LNG supply. Further, several transmission and

distribution projects, including the Green Power

Development and Energy Efficiency Improvement

Project, Greater Colombo Transmission and Loss

Reduction Project and Power System Reliability

Strengthening Project, were underway to expand

and strengthen the power transmission and

distribution system in order to reduce system

losses and to include more renewable energy

while maintaining system reliability.

The Government continued its efforts to

ensure the sustainability of the power sector

by increasing renewable energy generation.

Accordingly, the key hydropower projects, the

Uma Oya (120 MW) and Broadlands (35 MW)

projects were nearing completion as at end 2021

and both are expected to be commissioned in

2022. Meanwhile, the Moragolla, Gin Ganga, and

Thalpitigala hydropower projects were in progress

during the year, and these plants are expected to

add a total capacity of 65 MW to the national grid.

With the successful commissioning of the first

large-scale 100 MW Mannar wind power plant

(Phase I) at its full capacity in mid-2021, plans have

been made to add another 50 MW to the national

grid from this plant. Initiatives were also taken to

establish two 100 MW wind parks in two phases

in Mannar, while development activities relating

to wind plants located in the Pooneryn hybrid

renewable energy park and Trincomalee are also

under progress. In relation to solar energy, at the

end of 2021, around 27,068 consumers had joined

the Soorya Bala Sangramaya project and 416 MW

were added to the national grid under this project.

Meanwhile, initial activities of the Siyambalanduwa

solar power park (100 MW) and Pooneryn hybrid

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

107

renewable energy park (150 MW) were underway

during the year. A loan agreement for US dollars

100 million was signed with India in June 2021

to install rooftop solar plants on government

buildings and religious organisations, as well as

for floating solar pilot projects. Accordingly, this

project is expected to add an additional 120 MW

of solar capacity to the grid. Sri Lanka also signed

an agreement with the National Thermal Power

Corporation (NTPC) of India in March 2022 to set

up a solar power plant in Sampur, Trincomalee. As

a new initiative in power generation, Sri Lanka’s first

waste to energy power plant in Kerawalapitiya, with

a capacity of 10 MW, commenced its operations in

February 2021. Although a number of renewable

energy projects are in the pipeline, these proposed

and planned projects must be implemented in an

expeditious manner to avoid power shortages and

to prevent resorting to generation through high cost

alternatives, while also ensuring the achievement

of the Government’s policy target of meeting 70

per cent renewable energy share in the overall

generation mix. Furthermore, it is essential to

develop a consistent policy framework to formulate

an appropriate and sustainable energy mix, taking

into account long run economic costs as well as

the high capital investment and maintenance cost,

and the externalities of energy sources on the

environment and society. Accordingly, a Cabinet

Subcommittee was appointed in February 2022

to develop strategic plans for renewable energy

development and propose measures to mitigate

potential lapses in the implementation of proposed

renewable energy projects.

The Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority

(SLSEA) continued its efforts to encourage

sustainable energy development in the country.

The SLSEA engaged in energy conservation

activities, such as the establishment of Energy

Management Systems and the Energy Labelling

Programme, to facilitate the energy security of

the country. The Renewable Energy Resource

Development Plan for 2021-2026 was also compiled

with due consideration to the optimal utilisation of

renewable energy resources and identification

of land resources and potential transmission

systems for the projects. In addition, the SLSEA

was involved in the process of issuing energy

permits and provisional approvals for renewable

energy projects to accelerate the development of

indigenous renewable resources into commercial

scale projects.

Road Development

Initiatives of the Road Development

Authority (RDA), focused on improving rural-

urban connectivity, were continued with the aim

of improving the quality of road transportation

to reduce transit time, while also improving

the comfortable passage of both people and

goods. During the year, the total length of National

Highways (A and B class roads) maintained by the

RDA was approximately 12,225 km, while the total

length of expressways was 312.6 km. Activities

pertaining to the enhancement of the road network

via maintenance, development of expressways

and highways, widening and improvement of

roads, constructions of bridges and flyovers,

and the rehabilitation of natural disaster-affected

roads rehabilitation led the RDA to incur about

Rs. 200.8 billion. The expenditure incurred on the

development of expressways and highways stood

at Rs. 19.0 billion and Rs. 155.9 billion, respectively,

while expenditure related to the construction of

bridges and flyovers amounted to Rs. 14.7 billion

for the year.

Despite challenges relating to the availability

of labour and importation of construction

materials, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,

the Government steadfastly continued to

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

108

strengthen the expressway network of the

country to ensure improved urban-rural

linkages and thereby reinforce inclusive

growth. Accordingly, construction activities

pertaining to the Central Expressway that spans

from Kadawatha to Dambulla were prioritised

during the year enabling the section spanning

from Meerigama to Kurunegala was opened to

the public since mid January 2022. Moreover,

preliminary construction activities pertaining to the

first 12 km of the expressway from Pothuhera to

Rambukkana also commenced during the year.

Construction activities of the section extending

from Kadawatha to Meerigama was underway,

while the progress of land acquisition and

resettlement for section IV of the project from

Kurunegala to Dambulla stood at 70.7 per cent

as at the end of 2021. Meanwhile, construction

activities of the Ruwanpura Expressway from

Kahathuduwa to Palmadulla, spanning a length

of 76 km, were underway during the year.

Accordingly, construction activities of phase I of

the expressway spanning from Kahathuduwa to

Ingiriya commenced during the year. Further,

phase II and III from Ingiriya to Palmadulla will

commence after the RDA completes the revisiting

of the relevant feasibility study.

Overall vehicular traffic along the

expressways grew in 2021. Accordingly, the

average number of vehicles that travelled on a

daily basis on the Southern Expressway from

Kottawa to Godagama and from Palatuwa to

Mattala, increased by 2.7 per cent and 30.4

per cent, respectively, in 2020. Meanwhile, the

daily numbers of vehicles plying the Colombo

Katunayake Expressway and the Outer Circular

Highway recorded growths of 6.7 per cent and 38.8

per cent, respectively, compared to the previous

year. With these positive developments, the

revenue from expressways rose to approximately

Rs. 8.8 billion recording a 20.6 per cent growth in

annual revenue in 2021. Since the opening of the

section of the Central Expressway spanning from

Meerigama to Kurunegala in mid-January 2022,

toll collection for this section was recorded at Rs.

134.4 million as at end February 2022.

Activities related to the development and

rehabilitation of the existing road network

and bridges continued during the year. The

opening of the New Kelani Bridge at Peliyagoda in

late November 2021 was a key milestone in terms

of ongoing initiatives to mitigate traffic congestion

in the Colombo metropolitan area. This project is

located in the midst of a key transportation hub

that links the BIA and the Port of Colombo. The

newly opened six-lane bridge with its elevated

road leading to the city is expected to alleviate

the traffic congestion that could be seen in the

area over the past several years. Several other

road development projects were initiated during

the year, such as the construction of flyovers in

Slave Island and at the Gatambe and Kohuwala

junctions. The Southern Road Connectivity Project

(SRCP) which focuses on developing connectivity

of the southern roads, particularly with the

Southern Expressway, was also underway during

the year alongside the Badulla - Chenkaladi Road

Improvement Project (A005). Meanwhile, land

acquisition and resettlement activities relating to

the construction of the elevated highway from the

New Kelani Bridge to the Outer Circular Highway

were continued while the Environmental Impact

Assessment (EIA) for the section spanning from

Rajagiriya to Athurugiriya was in progress during

the year.

Road Passenger Transportation

The overall performance of road passenger

transportation activities continued to remain

subdued in 2021, reflecting limited transport

operations by both the public and private sector

amidst the intermittent imposition of mobility

restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19

and the increased preference for private

transportation. Consequently, operations of the

Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) and private

bus operators recorded notable declines in 2021.

Accordingly, during the year, operated kilometrage

and passenger kilometrage of the SLTB declined

by 19.7 per cent and 28.4 per cent, respectively,

while the average number of buses operated in

2021 increased to 4,449 buses from 4,045 buses

recorded in 2020, which was around 85.7 per cent

of the fleet that was effectively available for public

transportation operations of the SLTB during the

period. Meanwhile, the average number of buses

operated by the private sector declined by 16.1 per

cent to 9,053 buses in 2021 from 10,787 buses

recorded in the previous year. During the year,

passenger kilometrage and operated kilometrage

of private bus operators also contracted by 12.2 per

cent and 4.4 per cent, respectively. As at end 2021,

the National Transport Commission (NTC) had

issued 1,978 inter-provincial permits and 16,914

intra-provincial permits for private bus operations.

The NTC continued to work towards

expanding safe public transport facilities

during 2021 while adhering to health guidelines

issued, especially in relation to restricted

seating capacity, in order curb the spread

of COVID-19. Accordingly, several special bus

services, including Sisu Seriya, Gemi Seriya and

Nisi Seriya were continued in line with COVID-19

related health guidelines. Around 97 new services

were added to the Sisu Seriya service to facilitate

the transportation of school children. As at end

2021, there were 1,563 services in operation under

the Sisu Seriya programme, 194 services under

the Nisi Seriya programme and 14 services under

the Gemi Seriya rural bus service programme.

In view of further expanding this project, the NTC

granted approval to the SLTB to add 305 new Nisi

Seriya services during the year. The NTC also

commenced 59 new bus services, covering the

Southern, Sabaragamuwa, Uva, and North Central

provinces.

The two rounds of revisions to domestic

prices of fuel in 2021 and the revision undertaken

in March 2022 prompted the NTC to revise bus

fares upward. Accordingly, fares of normal, luxury

and semi-luxury bus services were revised upward

by an average of 17.4 per cent in December 2021

resulting in the minimum bus fare increasing from

Rs. 14.00 to Rs. 17.00. The revised fares came

into effect from 05 January 2022. Another round

of revisions took place in March 2022 leading to

an average increase of bus fares by 15.0 per cent,

with the minimum bus fare being revised upwards

to Rs. 20.00.

The financial performance of the SLTB

continued to deteriorate in 2021 with the decline

in operations during the period under review. As

per unaudited financial statements, total revenue

of the SLTB declined by 13.7 per cent to Rs. 26.9

billion in 2021, while total expenditure also declined

by around 9.1 per cent to Rs. 30.4 billion. The SLTB

recorded an operational loss of Rs. 3.4 billion in

2021 compared to an operational loss of Rs. 2.2

billion recorded in the previous year. During the

year, the subsidy provided by the Government to

undertake operations on uneconomical routes and

to facilitate subsidised season tickets amounted

to Rs.12.2 billion. Meanwhile, the SLTB continued

to carry out several initiatives to enhance its fleet

and thereby improve its service provisioning to

commuters. Accordingly, around 213 buses were

added to the fleet after rehabilitation, while the

Cabinet of Ministers granted approval to procure

500 new buses for the SLTB under the Indian line

of credit in early 2022.

Reflecting the impact of controls imposed

on the importation of non-essential imports

since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic,

new registrations of motor vehicles continued

to contract in 2021. New registration of motor

vehicles declined notably by 83.3 per cent,

compared to a decline of 44.8 per cent during

2020. The reduction was witnessed across all

major categories of motor vehicles during the

period under review, with new registrations of

single cabs, motor cars, motorcycles and dual

purposes vehicles recording declines of over 80

per cent.

registered an operating loss of Rs. 10.3 billion during

the year, compared to a loss of Rs. 10.1 billion in 2020.

The total revenue of the SLR stood at Rs. 2.7 billion

with a notable decrease of 41.3 per cent in 2021 in

comparison to the previous year, mainly due to the

contraction in revenue generated from passenger

transport by 53.0 percent. This decline in revenue

was driven by the April and August outbreaks of

COVID-19. During the year, total expenditure of the

SLR decreased by 17.1 per cent to Rs. 40.4 billion,

as recurrent and capital expenditure decreased by

11.2 per cent and 19.6 per cent, respectively, to Rs.

13.0 billion and Rs. 27.4 billion, respectively. Key

reasons for the decline in recurrent expenditure were

the reduction of personnel emoluments as well as

the decline in fuel expenditure due to the reduction

in operations.

The SLR carried out infrastructure

development and service improvement activities

in 2021, albeit at a slower pace. All enhancements

progressed, although at a modest pace amid

disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the year, double tracking of the railway line

from Kurana to Negombo was completed, whilst the

double tracking of the 5 km railway line from Kandy

to Sarasavi Uyana commenced. The project to

rehabilitate 200 passenger coaches that commenced

in 2020 was completed and the rehabilitation work of

another 100 passenger carriages was commenced

as an extension of the project, while releasing 30

passenger carriages back into service in 2021.

Under the Indian credit line secured in 2017, two air-

conditioned power sets were procured and added

to the train fleet, while the procurement of 120

passenger coaches was underway during the year.

Maintenance activities of railway bridges located

on the main line, coastal line, Puttalam line, Kelani

Valley line, Matale line, Northern line and Eastern

line were under progress during the year. Several

projects pertaining to the provisioning of signaling

and telecommunication systems were also carried

out during the year.

Civil Aviation

The performance of the civil aviation industry

continued to remain modest with the dampened

appetite for travel amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Accordingly, passenger arrivals continued to

decline by 36.8 per cent in 2021 following the sharp

decline of 76.0 per cent observed in 2020. Aircraft

movements recorded a marginal decline in 2021

compared to the previous year. The performance

of the sector was buoyed by public stakeholders’

commitment towards ensuring strict adherence to

COVID-19 related guidelines, while ensuring the

smooth transit of passengers. In addition to the BIA,

the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA)

also obtained the Airport Health Accreditation

Certificate from the Airports Council International

(ACI), for being compliant with international health

and safety guidelines. Meanwhile, a Rapid PCR

Testing Service facility was also established at

the BIA, catering to the special requirements of

passengers traveling to certain destinations in the

Middle East. Since March 2022, inbound passengers

who are fully vaccinated and those below the age of

12 years no longer require COVID-19 PCR tests or

Rapid Antigen Tests. Such measures of restoring

normalcy to travel alongside the gradual abatement

of the pandemic are expected to facilitate the steady

recovery of the sector.

Despite some hindrances caused by

the COVID-19 pandemic, several aviation

development projects were underway albeit at a

slower pace. The Airport and Aviation Services (Sri

Lanka) Limited (AASL) continued to progress with

the construction of the second terminal at the BIA

(Package A). In November 2021, the remote apron

and taxiways (Package B) were opened for use by

airlines. Moreover, as at end 2021, 75 per cent of the

The weak financial performance of SriLankan

Airlines (SLA) recorded some improvement

amid the reopening of Sri Lankan borders for

international travel in early 2021 and the overall

improvement in global appetite for travel. SLA’s

operating loss declined to Rs. 14.3 billion during

the nine months ending December 2021, thereby

registering an improvement of 49.3 per cent

compared to the corresponding period of 2020.

This improvement during the period under review

stemmed from the growth in revenue by 152.9 per

cent which exceeded the increase in operating

expenditure by 54.9 per cent. Notable initiatives that

enabled significant improvement in the operations of

SLA included the renewed focus on cargo operations

not only to continue export operations, but also for

the transportation of essential medical supplies and

vaccinations. During the year, SLA also increased

its cross-border commercial cargo operations and

also expanded to several new destinations during

the year enabling the continued operation of its

fleet. SLA continued to be actively engaged in Sri

Lanka’s tourism initiatives by being the official airline

for a key global adventure sporting event held in Sri

Lanka in March 2022.

Port Services

The port activities rebounded sharply in

2021 with operations exceeding pre-pandemic

levels. Despite the slowdown observed at the

beginning of the year, a turnaround in port activities

was observed throughout the year except for the

months of August and September, where the rapid

spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19 posed

some hindrances to port operations. During the year,

7.2 million Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) of

containers and 109,369 metric tons of cargo were

handled, surpassing historical highs. Accordingly,

the Port of Colombo registered expansions in

container and cargo handling of 5.8 per cent and

6.3 per cent, respectively. Further, the Colombo

International Container Terminals (CICT) and Sri

Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) recorded growths in

both cargo handling and container handling, while

the South Asia Gateway Terminals (SAGT) reported

a marginal decline. Notably, CICT handled over

3 million TEUs for the first time since its inception

a decade ago. Of the total volume of containers

handled at the Port of Colombo, CICT, SLPA and

SAGT accounted for 44.3 per cent, 30.3 per cent

and 25.4 per cent, respectively. During the year,

390,069 TEUs were handled by the East Container

Terminal (ECT) that was opened in October 2020.

With the increased arrivals of larger ships, overall

ship arrivals recorded a contraction in 2021 despite

the expansion in operations. The Colombo Port

continued to be ranked high on international rankings

such as the Container Port Performance Index (17th

position), compiled by the World Bank and IHS

Markit and on the Port Liner Shipping Connectivity

Index (17th position) compiled by the United Nations

Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)

highlighting the strong potential of the Colombo Port

to emerge as a leading maritime hub in the region.

Major infrastructure development initiatives

of the Colombo Ports steadily continued during

the year despite COVID-19 related disruptions.

The construction of the second phase of the ECT

commenced in January 2022, while the Build-

Operate-Transfer agreement for the West Container

Terminal (WCT) spanning 35 years was signed

between a foreign investor, a local investor and the

SLPA. Upon the expected completion of the ECT and

WCT by 2025 and 2026, respectively, the capacity

of the Port of Colombo is expected to be enhanced

by 6 million TEUs. Further, according to the

National Port Master Plan (NPMP), the preliminary

design and feasibility study to implement a new

Port Communication System (PCS) commenced

during 2021. Activities pertaining to the undertaking

of the feasibility study of the Colombo North Port

development project and call for Expressions of

Interest (EOI) to develop the Port of Galle as a fully-

fledged port for tourism were also underway during

the year.

Despite the extremely low performance

of domestic vehicle handling, total vehicle

handling at the Hambantota Port grew by 40.4

per cent during 2021 recording the highest

growth since the start of its operations, entirely

driven by transshipments. Accordingly, the total

number of vehicles handled at the Hambantota

Port stood at 493,400, of which 489,942 were vehicle

transshipments. While vehicle transshipments

registered a growth of 46.3 per cent, domestic

vehicle handling recorded a steep decline of 76.9

per cent with the continuation of restrictions on

motor vehicle importation.

The financial performance of the SLPA

improved in 2021 with the increase in port

activities. Accordingly, the SLPA recorded profits

before tax of Rs. 25.6 billion in 2021 compared to that

of Rs. 20.3 billion recorded in 2020. Total revenue of

the SLPA grew by 16.8 per cent to Rs. 45.5 billion,

and operating expenditure also increased by 10.7

per cent to Rs. 32.9 billion during the year.

Communication Services

The telecommunications sector continued

to expand in 2021, particularly facilitating the

contemporary communication needs of the

economy, emerging from the challenges of

the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As observed in 2020, the telecommunications

sector continued to play a pivotal role in ensuring

the continuity of economic activity during the year.

The rising adoption of online platforms for a myriad

of economic activities paved way for the healthy

pace of growth of the sector. Consequently,

the total mobile connections, fixed wireline and

wireless telephone connections continued to grow

alongside the improvements in telephone and

mobile penetration.

Internet usage also registered a significant

growth, largely driven by the adoption of

‘work-from-home’ arrangements and the

continuation of educational activities through

virtual learning platforms. Accordingly, total

internet connections grew by 26.9 per cent with the

rise in both mobile and fixed internet connections.

Further, internet density, which measures the

number of internet connections per 100 persons,

increased to 100.4 in 2021 compared to 79.9

recorded in 2020, reflecting the rapid transition of

activities, particularly related to the services sector,

to online platforms. In the meantime, total data

usage which has been on an upward trend since

October 2020 with the outbreak of the second

wave of the COVID-19 pandemic registered a

gradual moderation in the first quarter of 2021

alongside the removal of mobility restrictions from

early 2021. However, with the onset of the third

wave of the pandemic in end April 2021, a rapid

growth in internet data usage was witnessed, in

line with the imposition of mobility restrictions and

the changeover to online working and education

arrangements. The pace of growth declined from

October 2021 onwards with the removal of mobility

restrictions and the restoration of normalcy to the

economy.

With due recognition given to the importance

of digital transformation in tandem with the post

COVID-19 recovery process, the implementation

of the National Digital Transformation Strategy

(2021-2024) was commenced during the year.

continued to spearhead initiatives relating to the

digital transformation of the economy, such as the

Sri Lanka Unique Digital Identity, eLand Registry,

Digital Health Project, Digital Library Project, Lanka

Government Network 2.0, and Lanka Government

Cloud 2.0. In addition to these, ICTA also

developed email, video conferencing and digital

form submission facilities to enable the continuity

of services provided by government institutions

amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The performance of the Department of Posts

(DoP) continued to remain modest amid the

disruptions caused by the pandemic. Although

postal services were hindered by the third wave of

the pandemic and related COVID-19 containment

measures, with postal services being declared an

‘essential service’ by the Government in June 2021,

the DOP adopted measures to continue its service

delivery through the adoption of novel approaches.

The ‘Cash on Delivery’ services which were re-

launched in late 2020 continued successfully

during 2021 generating an income of Rs. 34.0

million. Meanwhile, the DOP also continued to

facilitate the payment of pensions of government

servants and those in the fisheries sector, along

with other social services allowances during

the year, while facilitating the free distribution of

medicine. These key services were provided,

without any disruptions, through the network of the

DOP comprising 654 main post offices, 3,410 sub

post offices and 130 private post offices, covering

8,157 delivery areas island-wide. However, the

financial position of the DOP continued to remain

weak in 2021 with an operational loss of Rs. 7.2

billion compared to a loss of Rs. 7.7 billion in 2020,

highlighting the need for the DOP to devise novel

value-added services in line with the ongoing

digital transformation and the evolving needs of

consumers.

Technology Agency (ICTA) to spearhead the

implementation of this which comprises the three

key programme pillars of Digital Government,

Digital Economy and Digital Services. While the

Digital Government and Digital Services pillars will

focus on the development of digital infrastructure

across public institutions, the Digital Economy pillar

is expected to focus on the development of local

capacity to enable the generation of annual export

revenue of US dollars 3 billion from the Information

Technology and Business Process Management

(IT-BPM) industry of the economy. Further, with

the intention of effective implementation of the

National Digital Transformation Strategy, a robust

monitoring and evaluation system encompassing

all projects and programmes is being developed to

ensure independent and unbiased governance.

Several other measures complementing

the National Digital Transformation Strategy

were also in progress, led by key stakeholder

institutions, focused on enhancing the

digital infrastructure base of the country. The

Telecommunication Regulatory Commission of Sri

Lanka (TRCSL) carried out the national project

Gamata Sanniwedanaya to improve 4G coverage

in 14,000 Grama Niladhari Divisions across all

districts. The project strives to achieve island

wide 4G coverage by end 2024, while as at end

2021, project activities were underway across 251

sites in ten districts. In order to facilitate distance

learning during the pandemic and to ensure

broader accessibility, the TRCSL ‘whitelisted’ the

eThaksalawa and Lanka Education and Research

Network (LEARN) online education platforms

enabling users to access such platforms without

any data charges. Other key initiatives undertaken

by the TRCSL to facilitate the evolving needs

of consumers were the granting of approval for

‘unlimited internet plans’ and the granting of legal

approval for subscribers to avail ‘mobile number

Water Supply and Irrigation

Provisioning of new water supply

connections continued during 2021 in line with

the Government’s National Policy Framework

which outlines the provision of clean and safe

drinking water for every household by 2025 as

a key thrust area. Accordingly, 192,087 new water

supply connections were provided by the National

Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWS&DB)

reaching a total of 2.8 million connections by the

end of the year. This resulted in an improvement

of households’ access to safe drinking water to

94.4 per cent by end 2021 from 93.2 per cent by

end 2020. However, non-revenue water usage of

the country increased marginally to 25.8 per cent

during the year compared to 24.6 per cent in 2020.

Meanwhile, the NWS&DB recorded an operating

loss of Rs. 3.1 billion during the year, compared

to the loss of Rs. 370.5 million recorded in the

previous year, owing to increases in operation

and maintenance costs during the period under

review.

Various development projects were

carried out under the purview of the Ministry

of Water Supply and NWS&DB in line with

the National Policy Framework. During the

year, activities related to physical work of 118

projects were commenced under the Water for

All flagship pledge made to the public under the

National Policy Framework. Further, with the

aim of improving the volumes of safe drinking

water throughout the country, 33 major water

supply schemes were in progress during 2021.

Meanwhile, the Deduru Oya water supply project,

which commenced in 2016, was completed during

the year, thereby providing safe drinking water

to 97,700 beneficiaries residing in the Maho and

Polpithigama divisional secretariats, while several

other projects including the Kirama Katuwana

water supply project and Katana water supply

project were also completed during 2021. The

Jaffna and Kilinochchi water supply and sanitation

project which aims at improving the provision of

safe drinking water and sanitation facilities in the

Jaffna and Kilinochchi districts achieved progress

of 61 per cent at end 2021. Under this project,

work related to the Thalaiyadi seawater treatment

plant, Nainativu seawater treatment plant and the

Jaffna - Kilinochchi water distribution network were

commenced during the year. Further, the Greater

Matale Water Supply Project, which focuses on

enhancing clean drinking water coverage in the

Matale district achieved progress of 94 per cent

by end 2021.

The Department of Irrigation (DoI)

continued to develop irrigation schemes

across the country to support agriculture

sector performance. Accordingly, the Ellewewa

reservoir project commenced alongside several

other projects such as the rehabilitation of the

Kudavilachchiya reservoir and Dematagala tank.

Further, the provision of irrigation water for smaller

communities continued to be expanded in various

parts of the island as a key initiative under the

Gama Samaga Pilisandara programme. During

the year, 26 major irrigation projects were in

progress incurring a cost of Rs. 5.6 billion, of which

Rs. 2.7 billion and Rs. 556.1 million were spent on

the Yan Oya and Deduru Oya reservoir projects,

respectively. Meanwhile, the Wari Saubhagya

National Programme that aims to rehabilitate

rural tanks and anicuts across all districts was

also commenced under the stewardship of the

DoI in 2021. The project aims to cultivate 50,000

acres of barren paddy field through improvements

to 2,500 village tanks. The Climate Resilience

Improvement Project (CRIP), which commenced

in 2014 with a view to enhancing the resilience

of hydraulic infrastructure against adverse climate

shocks, was completed during 2021. Further, the

Cabinet of Ministers granted approval to revise

upwards the total cost of the Uma Oya downstream

development project to Rs. 17.9 billion from

Rs. 9.4 billion. The project achieved 65 per cent

physical progress by end 2021. Furthermore, the

Productivity Enhancement and Irrigation System

Efficiency Improvement Project (PIESIP), which

was inaugurated in 2017 with the objective of

improving irrigation infrastructure across 72,882

hectares of irrigable lands benefiting 97,832

farmer families, was continued, although at a

slower pace owing to disturbances caused by the

pandemic.

3.3 Social Infrastructure Policies, Institutional Framework and Performance

Health

Despite the outbreaks of COVID-19 during

2021, particularly due to the spread of the Delta

variant, the imposition of appropriate and

timely mobility restrictions by the Government

alongside the globally acclaimed vaccination

drive enabled Sri Lanka to minimise the

human toll of the Omicron variant in early

2022. Following the two waves of the pandemic in

March 2020 and in October 2020, the third wave

of the pandemic emerged in April 2021. At the

peak of the third wave in August 2021, the daily

new confirmed COVID-19 cases (smoothed) per

one million increased to 276 as against 11 cases

per one million population reported till mid April

2021. This was driven by the highly contagious

Delta variant of COVID-19. However, in contrast

to the nationwide lockdown that was implemented

during the first wave of the pandemic in March and

April 2020, the Government cautiously adopted

mobility restrictions during the third wave to

curb the spread of the virus, while facilitating the

continuity of economic activity in order to ensure

overall socioeconomic wellbeing. During the initial

stages of the third wave, all identified patients were

hospitalised or quarantined at designated centres,

while first contacts of patients were quarantined

either at quarantine centres or at their residences.

However, as the caseload rapidly increased, in an

attempt to prevent overcrowding, the Government

decided to hospitalise COVID-19 patients on

a priority basis. The marked rise observed in

fatality rates in August 2021 led the Government

to impose an islandwide curfew from 21 August

till end September 2021, during which essential

economic activities were allowed to continue. With

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

118

the vaccination drive that gained pace from end

July 2021 onwards, a steady decline in the caseload

was observed from mid September 2021 onwards

allowing for all mobility restrictions to be lifted with

effect from 01 October 2021. Subsequent to the

detection of the Omicron variant in early December

2021, there was a steady rise in cases to 66 cases

per one million population was observed in mid

February 2022. Despite this steady rise, with 65

per cent of the population having completed the

initial protocol of 2 vaccine doses and 28 per cent

of the population having received the booster dose,

the fatality rate declined to a relatively low level of

2 deaths per one million population compared to

10 deaths per one million population observed in

August 2021. Considering the rapid progress of

the vaccination drive, the Ministry of Health (MoH)

issued a circular in late January 2022 allowing

COVID-19 positive patients to be released from

isolation after 7 days from the date of the Rapid

Antigen Test or PCR positivity or from the date

of onset of symptoms. Further, fully vaccinated

close contacts without symptoms of COVID-19

were not required to be quarantined, while those

who were partially vaccinated or unvaccinated

could be released from quarantine after the

completion of a 7-day quarantine period. In early

2022, the vaccination programme was expanded

to encompass children above the age of 12 years

with those in the age group of 12 – 15 years being

provided with a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine.

In late January 2022, an Extraordinary Gazette

was issued preventing people from entering

public places without possession of proof of being

fully vaccinated against COVID-19 with effect

from 30 April 2022. The Government continued

to steadfastly allocate significant amounts as

pandemic related expenditure. Accordingly, all

related expenditure for the year amounted to

Rs. 165.6 billion. Of this, health sector related

expenditures, such as on vaccines, quarantine

facilities, health sector infrastructure and medical

supplies, stood at Rs. 130.1 billion.

Amid the challenges of the pandemic, Sri

Lanka continued to deal with the outbreaks of

other communicable diseases as well. In 2021,

a total of 23,853 Dengue cases were reported,

of which a significant share was reported in

December with the onset of the monsoonal rains.

Approximately 70 per cent of cases reported

were from the Colombo, Batticaloa, Gampaha,

Kalutara and Kurunegala districts. The upward

trend continued with over 8,000 Dengue cases

being identified during the first three months of

2022, raising concerns about the resurgence of

Dengue, especially after relatively fewer cases had

been reported in the corresponding period of 2021.

The improvement in case trends was driven by

the COVID-19 mobility restrictions which enabled

households to clean their surrounding vicinity and

keep premises free of mosquito breeding grounds.

Increased awareness among individuals about

personal hygiene, especially the increased use

of facemasks, led to the usual seasonal Influenza

pattern not being observed during the year. The

number of leptospirosis cases identified in 2021

stood at 6,855 cases compared to 8,579 cases

reported in 2020.

Despite the pressures exerted by the

COVID-19 pandemic on the health sector, the

Government remained committed to ensuring

continuity of medical care to those struggling

with Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)

and the segments of the population who need

targeted health care. Accordingly, the MoH

continued to coordinate with district level Medical

Officers to ensure the uninterrupted supply of

medicines and undertake the follow-up of patients.

As in 2020, the MoH delivered medicines through

health sector staff, non-health government officers

and via post. A web-based mechanism was also

established in collaboration with the Pharmacy

Owners’ Association to facilitate the convenient

purchase and delivery of medicines to homes.

Further, the MoH continued to engage in creating

awareness via mass media and social media

regarding the adoption of healthy lifestyle habits,

the management of NCDs, identification of early-

warning signs and ways and means to obtain

medical services in an emergency. The Family

Health Bureau also spearheaded a number of

initiatives fulfilling the health needs of the vulnerable

maternal and child segments during the pandemic

via provisioning of reproductive, maternal,

newborn, child, adolescent and youth health care,

especially to pregnant mothers and children who

tested positive for COVID-19. Sri Lanka was the

first country in South Asia to vaccinate pregnant

mothers in an attempt to minimise the impact of

the disease. With due consideration to Sri Lanka’s

struggle with the triple burden of malnutrition, i.e.,

under nutrition, overweightness or obesity and

micronutrient deficiencies, several district specific

targeted interventions were developed to overcome

these issues.

During the year, initiatives were underway

to improve the infrastructure base of the public

healthcare system. Accordingly, nine healthcare

institutions were upgraded and recategorised,

while the necessary approvals were granted for

the establishment of 27 new primary medical care

units. The project pertaining to the remodeling

and construction of additional buildings at the

New District General Hospital – Matara was

underway during the year and attained physical

progress of 90 per cent. In addition, expansion of

the physical infrastructure of the cancer treatment

unit at the Teaching Hospital in Karapitiya and the

strengthening and streamlining of the Accident and

Emergency Care units in 28 line ministry hospitals

were also in progress during the year.

Private sector healthcare services played

a pivotal role in alleviating the pressures on

the public health sector, especially those

stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Private

hospitals have been at the helm of providing

innovative services to meet the growing needs of

the population, particularly driven by the pandemic.

The wide availability of affordable telemedicine

services through private healthcare providers

allowed patients to receive evaluations, diagnoses

and treatments from medical professionals

using telecommunications technology. Private

hospitals also played a cornerstone role in curbing

COVID-19 outbreaks through the timely provision

of Intermediate Care Centres, in addition to

COVID-19 related testing services and treatments.

The expanded service provisioning by private

healthcare providers ensured that needy sectors of

the population and those who do not have access

to private health care were not crowded out of

public sector health care services. As at the end of

2021, the private health care system comprised 233

hospitals with a capacity of 5,444 beds.

Education

The Ministry of Education (MoE) was

engaged in uplifting the productive potential of

the human capital base of the economy, in line

with the vision of the Government towards the

creation of a productive citizenry and vibrant

human resource base. Accordingly, the MoE

developed a strategic plan for the period of 2021-

2025 in collaboration with the provincial education

authorities and national level education institutions,

pursuant to the principle of ‘learning for all’ in

primary and secondary stages of education. The

medium-term plan for the general education sector

was organised under the four key thrust areas

of strengthening equity in education, improving

quality of education, strengthening stewardship

and service delivery of general education as well as

enhancing evidence-based education policy making

and planning. Other initiatives, such as the New

National School Development Programme, were

also underway. This programme entails the upgrade

of 831 selected schools to the 'national school'

category in order to increase the number of national

schools islandwide to 1,204 schools. During the

year, Rs. 1.9 billion was allocated for this programme

and each of the selected schools received

Rs. 2.0 million for improvement and development

of physical and learning infrastructure. As the

first step, 09 schools were declared as national

schools in early 2021. With the intention of inducing

qualitative improvements to learning outcomes, the

National Institute of Education (NIE) developed a

new curriculum for Ordinary Level and Advanced

Level under the theme of ‘inquiry based learning’

with increased focus on active learning, while

teachers training modules and manuals for teachers

were also improved to facilitate the inquiry based

learning process. The programme to introduce

the 'Technology' stream as the fifth stream at the

Advanced Level continued to progress in 2021, with

09 schools being added to this programme resulting

in 466 schools providing the Technology stream

by end 2021. Meanwhile, the ‘13-years mandatory

education’ policy was further augmented during

the year with 523 schools island-wide offering the

‘Vocational’ stream for Advanced Level studies.

Notably, of the 9,603 students enrolled under the

Vocational stream, approximately 87 per cent were

identified as vulnerable to dropping out from the

education system, in the absence of this option.

During the year, about 11,000 students who had

been undertaking studies in this stream were directed

to institutional training. Further, 6,390 students

who were enrolled under this stream in previous

years completed Level 04 of National Vocational

Qualifications (NVQ) and were absorbed across

several industries such as tourism and hospitality,

automobile/electrical services, care giving/sports,

IT, construction and agriculture and plantation,

among others. Plans are underway to extend this

programme to another 78 schools during 2022.

Intermittent closures of physical schools

during the year warranted the adoption of

various novel methods to conduct general

education activities to overcome the challenges

of the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools remained

closed either partially or fully during the most part of

2021, with the brief exceptions of usual operations

during the month of March and the last quarter

of 2021. During these brief periods of opening, in

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

121

collaboration with the MoH, the MoE took several

measures to ensure the strict adherence to

COVID-19 related health guidelines by children,

teaching and non-teaching staff across the school

premises. Such measures included the regular

disinfection of classrooms, availability of hand

washing facilities, physically distanced classroom

arrangements and coordination of arrangements

for secure transportation of students. Towards the

latter part of the year, the MoE closely engaged

with health sector stakeholders to expedite the

process of vaccinating teachers, while extending

vaccine deployment to students above the age of

16 years. During periods of closure, for the second

consecutive year, the MoE strived to ensure the

continuity of education activities through hybrid

mechanisms. Continuation and further expansion

of the provision of online programmes that were

in place during 2020 was a key aspect of the

hybrid mechanisms. Accordingly, the national

e-learning management system e-Thaksalawa

was expanded with additional content spanning all

school grades, while the MoE continued to telecast

educational programmes in both the Sinhala and

Tamil languages under the Gurugedara educational

programme. During the year, measures were

taken to broadcast the audio of these educational

programmes through national radio channels to

enhance outreach. With due consideration to gaps

in technology and internet infrastructure, especially

in rural and estate areas, the Radio e-Thaksalawa

mobile application was developed during the year

to provide round-the-clock access to audio contents

of the Gurugedara programme. Meanwhile, over

2,000 Regional Distance Learning Education

Centres were established in remote areas to

facilitate students who were having difficulties in

accessing existing online learning facilities. During

the year, the MoE issued a new assessment tool

for evaluating children with special education

needs, thereby enabling the creation of Individual

Education Plans (IEPs) for such children, especially

considering their increased vulnerability to weaker

learning outcomes amid the dearth of face-to-face

interactions in learning environments. Although,

several national examinations were delayed due to

unforeseen circumstances caused by the COVID-19

pandemic, they were promptly rescheduled to take

place in 2022. Accordingly, the Grade 05 Scholarship

examination and the Advanced Level examination

which were to take place in August 2021 were

postponed and subsequently held in January 2022

and February 2022, respectively, while the Ordinary

Level examinations were postponed to May 2022.

Although the commitment of all relevant

stakeholders to ensure the continuity of general

education activities is highly commendable,

especially the rapid transition of such activities

to online platforms, it is important to duly

recognise that such activities were likely to

have exacerbated existing inequalities in

learning outcomes, largely driven by disparities

in access to technology-related infrastructure

facilities and relevant literacy levels. Further,

the quality of online learning outcomes needs to

be assessed as they are likely to be straddled by

issues caused by the lack of physical interactions

that are unique to those observed while engaging

with teachers and peers in classroom and laboratory

environments and in extracurricular activities. These

learning gaps are likely to have lingering effects

on learning outcomes which can translate into

significant gaps in skills, abilities and knowledge in

children. Relevant stakeholders should undertake

proactive assessments of potential learning losses

during the past two years and adopt focused and

targeted measures to fill these learning gaps with

the recent return of children to regular physical

school. It is also vital that the Government continues

to maintain the online education infrastructure base

that has been developed to address the needs of

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

122

the COVID-19 pandemic as such infrastructure can

contribute to the reduction of existing disparities in

the country’s existing education infrastructure base

through unhindered access and free availability of

these vital resources.

The Government continued to carry out

higher education activities through distance

learning platforms during 2021. During the year,

higher education activities at state universities

were conducted through the LEARN online

education system which was in place since March

2020. Under the LEARN platform, students and

academia were provided with free data and lectures

were delivered through online platforms. During

the year, at times there were as many as 250,000

attendees in a day, of which 100,000 participants

have been simultaneous users. Meanwhile, with

a view to ensuring the quality of online education

services, the University Grants Commission (UGC)

continued to review the progress of the LEARN

platform in collaboration with universities during the

period under review.

During the year, several initiatives

were in progress to expand the tertiary

education infrastructure base of the country.

Accordingly, two new universities, the Gampaha

Wickramarachchi University of Indigenous

Medicine, and the University of Vavuniya were

established during the year. The Gampaha

Wickramarachchi Ayurveda Institute was

upgraded as a fully-fledged university in March

2021, comprising 04 faculties with 13 academic

departments offering 08 undergraduate courses

and 08 postgraduate level courses. The Vavuniya

Campus of the University of Jaffna was upgraded

as the University of Vavuniya in August 2021 and is

expected to promote higher tertiary level education

in the areas of Business Studies, Applied Sciences

and Technology Studies. In addition, it has

been proposed to establish a National Nursing

University and a National University for Teachers

Training. During the academic year 2020/21, 16

new courses were introduced by the UGC, across

several universities.

The private sector also continued to

facilitate the expansion of opportunities in

the higher education sector of the country.

Accordingly, there were 21 Non-State Higher

Education Institutes (NSHEIs) recognised as

degree awarding institutes as at end 2021. During

the year, the number of accredited programmes

offered by NSHEIs increased to 190 from 167 in

2020, thereby providing increased opportunities

across different streams of study for students to

pursue higher education through the private sector.

Meanwhile, the MoE continued to work towards

developing a five-year re-review guideline, with

a view to ensuring the quality standards of these

NSHEIs, while initiatives regarding the introduction

of minimum standards for the institutional review and

programme review of NSHEIs were also underway.

The Technical and Vocational Education and

Training (TVET) sector continued to provide

education opportunities during 2021 aimed at

enhancing skill levels of the workforce in line

with the emerging needs of the economy. As at

end December 2021, there were 1,071 registered

institutions engaged in providing TVET education,

comprising the Government, private and non-

governmental institutions. Through this extensive

network of institutions, over 3,000 accredited

courses were conducted, while 45,033 NVQ

certificates were issued to qualifying students during

the period under review. Meanwhile, the Tertiary

and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC)

adopted measures to conduct NVQ programmes

via online platforms and television lesson series

while also developing an online system to collect

data on students’ training performance as well

as to evaluate programme applicants. The TVEC

developed new national standards for several NVQ

levels, while revising existing guidelines to ensure

the continued relevance of NVQ programmes.

Meanwhile, the Department of Technical Education

and Training (DTET) continued to upgrade

vocational training facilities across the island to

cater to the industrial demand for skilled labour.

Accordingly, several infrastructure enhancement

projects were carried out during the year under the

Tech Udana programme, while a new technical

college was established in Puttalam during the

year.

Housing and Urban Development

Amid several hindrances caused by the

COVID-19 pandemic, the Government continued

to initiate and implement several projects aimed

at enhancing housing facilities in the country.

Accordingly, a number of housing projects were

commenced in line with the Government’s National

Policy Framework with the objective of ensuring

comfortable and affordable housing facilities for all

Sri Lankans. In line with the Government’s vision,

the National Housing Development Authority

(NHDA) continued to implement the Obata Geyak

– Ratata Hetak programme to fulfil the housing

needs of low-income families who are unable to

build houses despite owning a land plot. Under

this programme, the NHDA is expected to build

at least one house in each Grama Niladhari

division. Accordingly, in 2021, the construction of

12,192 units was initiated, of which 4,075 units

were completed during the year. Further, the

Mihindu Niwahana housing programme for low-

income parents of ordained monks and Siyapatha

and Sapiri Mahal Niwasa housing programmes

to provide affordable housing for middle income

earners, were underway during the period under

review. The Urban Development Authority (UDA)

also continued its Middle Income Housing Project

and Affordable Housing Project to meet growing

housing needs in urban areas and their immediate

surroundings, while enabling improvements to the

living standards of the middle income population,

including government sector employees.

The UDA engaged in several projects during

the year with a focus on improving livability of

urban environments, while developing citizen-

centric townships. During the year, under the

Township Development Project of the UDA,

around 57 projects including the Boralesgamuwa

multipurpose building, Minuwangoda market, and

real time flood mitigation programme were carried

out. These projects comprise the development of

car parks, bus stands, public markets, multipurpose

buildings, and urban parks that were implemented

across all provinces in accordance with town

plans for urban development. The UDA launched

the Siyak Nagara (Hundred Cities) Beautification

Programme to redevelop regional town centres

into citizen-centric cities with improved livability.

Several other key projects, such as public

institution development projects, the Beira Lake

Rehabilitation and Redevelopment Project,

reconstruction of Jaffna Town Hall, and Maritime

City Development Project were also underway

during 2021, focusing on improving the aesthetics

and functionality of urban environments. In

addition, continued efforts were made to improve

urban transportation facilities to create an inclusive

transportation system in the Western region under

the Western Region Transport Development

Project. Accordingly, construction work on the

Metro Rail Transit System and the Multi-Modal

Transport Centres such as the Kadawatha and

Colombo-Fort transport hubs progressed in 2021.

Several investment projects, including the High-

rise Mixed Development at Galle Town Centre,

Theme Park Project at Gregory Lake, Hambantota

Logistics Hub and Multi-storied Car Park at BIA,

focused on attracting Foreign Direct Investments

(FDIs) are also currently in the pipeline and being

expedited under development clusters of the UDA.

The Government continued its efforts

to improve the efficiency of waste disposal

systems to build national capacity in relation

to integrated solid waste management. The

Metro Colombo Solid Waste Management Project

was initiated to provide a long-term sustainable

solid waste management system for urban areas.

The project was underway during the year with an

overall progress of 87 per cent by end 2021, and

is expected to be completed by mid-2022. Upon

completion, around 1,200 metric tons of waste per

day will be transported to the Aruwakkalu landfill

using existing railway lines. While concerns have

been raised by various stakeholders regarding the

environmental implications of the project, with the

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

125

right design and proper management, the sanitary

landfill is expected to provide a sustainable

solution for the growing waste disposal issue of

the country. Meanwhile, the Government took

initial steps to establish waste management parks

and small scale waste management centres,

while developing mechanical composting plants in

Homagama, Badulla and Jaffna over the next few

years.

Development activities in the Colombo Port

City project were continued in 2021 with a view

to building a leading financial centre and one of

the most modern and attractive cities in South

Asia. Following the completion of all reclamation

activities, the reclaimed area was designated as a

Special Economic Zone by the Colombo Port City

Economic Commission Act, No. 11 of 2021, which

was passed in May 2021. Activities related to

internal infrastructure development were underway

in 2021, attaining a cumulative progress of 67 per

cent in relation to infrastructure works and 52 per

cent in landscaping activities of Phase I, which

comprises the development of infrastructure,

as well as office and retail space and residential

units. Further, by end 2021, construction activities

pertaining to sewage and waste water disposal

infrastructure for the Colombo Port City were in

progress in line with the Metro Colombo Solid

Waste Management Project. The water supply

line from Maligakanda was completed, and the

Elie-house water supply line achieved progress

of 55 per cent at end 2021. Construction of main

road access connections from the mainland to

Colombo Port City is under progress. Of the key

access infrastructure, the Port Access Elevated

Highway that allows the access to Port City from

highway network achieved 35 per cent progress

by end 2021, while the Marine Drive Extension

Project, which provides access to the Port City

from the South of Colombo, was at its initial

stages. The Yacht Marina area was opened to the

public in January 2022, while Phase I is expected

to be completed by early 2023 with the expedited

completion of infrastructure developments.

Poverty Alleviation and Safety Nets

Sri Lanka’s commendable progress in

poverty alleviation is likely to have been

affected by the pandemic, along with a

widening of already prevalent inequalities.

Sri Lanka made significant strides in reducing

poverty over the past two and a half decades

as a result of the several multi-pronged poverty

alleviation efforts of consecutive governments

and their efforts to creating inclusive growth. As

per the official poverty line that was devised by the

Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) based

on the Household Income and Expenditure Survey

(HIES) 2002, the Poverty Head Count Index (PCHI)

had reduced from 28.8 per cent in 1995/1996 to

3.2 per cent in the 2019 survey round. With the

recent updating of the official poverty line using

HIES 2012/13 data, although the declining trend of

poverty is similar, the share of the population living

below the poverty line in 2019 stood at 14.3 per

cent. Accordingly, as per the updated poverty line,

approximately 3.04 million individuals live below

the poverty line which is almost 4.4 times more

than the number of people that were previously

estimated to be living below the 2002 poverty line.

The HIES-2019 also reveals that approximately

one in six Sri Lankans are multidimensionally poor

and experience deprivations across 42 per cent of

the weighted indicators. Accordingly, the national

multidimensional poverty head count ratios were

relatively high at 16.6 per cent in rural areas

and 51.3 per cent in estate areas. The people in

the estate sector experienced the highest level

of deprivation. Among the districts, the lowest

incidences of multidimensional poverty were in

Colombo (3.5 per cent) and Gampaha (5.1 per

cent), whereas the highest was in Nuwara Eliya

(44.2 per cent). Despite the substantial disparity

across the districts, the quantum of people who

are multidimensionally poor were higher in the

Colombo and Gampaha districts due to the higher

population density that is typical of urban areas.

This highlights the vulnerability of a significant

share of the population to poverty even prior to the

COVID-19 pandemic. With the prolonging of the

pandemic and the disruptions that it has entailed,

a ‘new poor’ segment of the population who remain

at the brink of poverty is likely to have emerged

in recent years. Duly considering the likelihood

of worsening poverty outcomes and disparities,

despite the limited fiscal space and challenging

economic circumstances, the Government and the

Central Bank consistently focused on cushioning

the adverse impacts of the pandemic on vulnerable

segments of the population via unprecedented

fiscal and monetary stimulus packages. While these

measures are likely to have dampened the impact of

the pandemic on the financial and nutritional status

of the population to some extent, other disparities

that were prevalent prior to the pandemic, such as

those in relation to access to health and education

infrastructure and the asset base of households,

could impede the contemporary and future

productive capacity of households. Going forward,

for the Government to undertake efficacious and

targeted policy initiatives to prevent any scarring

of households through the lingering impacts of

COVID-19 or similar unanticipated episodes, it

is vital that comprehensive and recent datasets

related to poverty are made available by respective

institutions in a timely manner.

The Government initiated several social

protection measures targeting vulnerable

groups of the population with a view to

alleviating the financial burden of the loss

of livelihoods stemming from the COVID-19

pandemic. For the second consecutive year, the

Government continued to expand existing social

assistance programmes with due consideration

to the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19

pandemic on needy segments of the society.

Accordingly, during the third wave of the pandemic,

the Government provided an allowance of Rs.

5,000 to vulnerable households in two rounds

during the months of April and June 2021. As such,

around Rs. 14.1 billion was distributed among

2.8 million eligible households in April 2021 followed

by a second round distribution of Rs. 8.2 billion

among 1.7 million families in June 2021. Many

households, including Samurdhi beneficiaries,

low-income and vulnerable families, the elderly,

disabled and kidney disease patients benefited

from this programme. In addition, in August 2021,

the Government also provided an allowance of Rs.

2,000 per family, targeting families who had lost

their livelihoods but were not receiving assistance

from any of the Government’s existing allowance

programmes. Accordingly, a total of Rs. 11.8 billion

had been distributed under this programme.

The Government also remained committed

to the continuation of all existing safety net

programmes during the year, in order to

preserve the economic wellbeing of vulnerable

segments of the population. During the year,

the Department of Samurdhi Development (DSD)

distributed Rs. 51.6 billion among 1.8 million

beneficiary families under the longstanding

Samurdhi Subsidy programme. The DSD also

carried out numerous programmes targeted

at livelihood, social and entrepreneurship

development with the intention of creating ‘safety

ropes’ that would enable households to lift

themselves out of poverty. The Government also

continued to provide the nutrition allowance of Rs.

20,000 for young mothers, while continuing the

Morning Meal programme for pre-school children

and the provisioning of ‘take home’ rations in lieu

of in-school meals under the National School

Meal programme. These programmes were

implemented by the State Ministry of Women

and Child Development, Pre-School and Primary

Education, School Infrastructure and Education

Services. These measures are expected to have

played a vital role in preserving the nutrition

status of young children and new mothers amid

the challenges faced by needy households. In

view of the disproportionately higher and far more

immediate impact of COVID-19 on the poor, the

programme was further augmented by the decision

to increase the Samurdhi subsidy amount by

around 28 per cent per beneficiary family from

February 2022 onwards, as proposed in the Budget

2022. Accordingly, the family unit allowances of

Rs. 3,500, Rs. 2,500 and Rs. 1,500 per family were

increased to Rs. 4,500, Rs. 3,200 and Rs. 1,900

per family, respectively.

While the prevalence of numerous safety

nets helped Sri Lanka to make significant

progress in poverty alleviation and is expected

to have dampened the impact of the COVID-19

pandemic on vulnerable segments of the

society, effective targeting of such measures

and development of new initiatives that are

not reliant on the government budget are

essential to ensure efficacious and sustainable

outcomes. In recent years, there have been

concerns that assistance programmes such as

Samurdhi have been less effective in poverty

alleviation due to poor targeting. Revisiting the

list of social assistance recipients to identify the

truly vulnerable, implementation of economic

empowerment programmes for the poor, and the

creation of an effective exit mechanism from social

assistance programmes within a reasonable time

span, are crucial for improved targeting of social

assistance programmes, while alleviating the

associated burden on the Government budget. In

this regard, expediting the establishment of a

regularly updated social registry is imperative

to improving the efficacy of such interventions.

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka’s rapid demographic transition

to an aging society highlights the importance of

retirement benefit schemes such as the government

pension and provident fund schemes, especially for

informal sector workers who are outside the ambit

of existing social security programmes. Although

only around 30 per cent of the population is being

currently covered by a formal pension scheme,

the current pension framework of the Government

is becoming an ever-growing fiscal burden on the

government budget amid the shrinking fiscal space.

Therefore, broadening the country’s social security

framework through the introduction of a nationwide

contributory pension scheme is essential to ensuring

a secure retirement for all in the coming decades

especially considering the growing life expectancy

of Sri Lankans and their evolving needs.

Environment

The Ministry of Environment was engaged in

several initiatives related to the strengthening of

the regulatory and policy framework pertaining

to the preservation of the natural resources of

the country. Key steps in creating a conducive

policy environment to mitigate environmental

issues and support sustainable development

were the preparation of the National Environment

Policy – 2022 and the National Environment Action

Plan 2021 – 2030. With the intention of providing

focused interventions in relation to environmentally

sensitive areas which are hotspots of biodiversity,

the draft of the National Policy on Environmental

Sensitive Areas in Sri Lanka was submitted to the

Cabinet of Ministers in November 2021, seeking their

approval. Currently, the National Climate Change

Policy of Sri Lanka, which was formulated in 2012, is

also being updated to include recent developments

in relation to climate change. During the year,

several other environmental programmes such as

the Surakimu Ganga programme to minimise the

pollution of river systems through multi-stakeholder

collaborations and the Husma Dena Thuru island-

wide national tree planting programme were also in

progress. A key commendable initiative undertaken

during the year was the gazetting and enforcement

of regulations banning single use plastic products

from 31 March 2021 onwards and the introduction

of a plastic category coding system. Another

key milestone during the year was the launch of

Sri Lanka’s first waste-to energy power plant in

Kerawalapitiya that is expected to generate 10

MW. Construction of another plant in Kotawila was

underway to generate electricity from biogas using

biodegradable waste. This is expected to add 400

KW to the natural grid. Such initiatives are essential

to solve Sri Lanka’s growing waste management

issues in a sustainable manner

The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) and

the National Building Research Organisation

(NBRO) continued to engage in several activities

to provide early warnings and to improve the

country’s disaster preparedness and disaster

responses. During the year, the DMC had issued

338 special weather warnings to enable the general

public, related disaster management authorities and

fisheries community to facilitate early preparedness

activities and to mitigate risks stemming from

natural disasters. In addition to charter activation

pertaining to the X-Press Pearl oil spill, the South-

3

West monsoon floods and Second Inter monsoon

floods, the DMC also worked to assess the X-Press

Pearl oil spill. The preparation of multi hazard risk

profiles for selected cities and work pertaining

to an all-island school disaster risk assessment

was also underway during the year. In 2021,

the NBRO was actively engaged in monitoring,

dissemination of early warnings for evacuation and

the implementation of corrective and preventive

mitigation measures in relation to landslides

and slope failures particularly in the Ratnapura,

Kegalle, Kalutara, Kandy and Kurunegala districts.

During the year, 6,763 Landslide Risk Assessment

Reports were issued by the NBRO after conducting

necessary investigations and analyses. Further,

under the Reduction of Landslide Vulnerability by

Mitigation Measures Project, the NBRO commenced

mitigation works across 24 sites and another 32

sites were undergoing the procurement process.

All mitigation work pertaining to the 147 sites that

had been earmarked as vulnerable to landslides is

expected to be completed by 2025.
