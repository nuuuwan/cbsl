"2.1 Overview"
"The Sri Lankan economy rebounded by 3.7 per cent in 2021, recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic"
"and  also aided by the favourable base effect  that resulted from the significant contraction in the economy in"
"2020. Nonetheless, the fast spread of the highly infectious Delta variant put the recovery at risk, particularly"
"during  the  third  quarter  of  the  year,  adversely  affecting  Services  and  Industry  activities.  While  grappling"
"with  renewed  flare-ups,  focused  mobility  restrictions  coupled  with  policy  stimuli  and  the  countrywide"
"vaccination rollout encouraged embracing a normal routing and provided more room for economic activities"
"towards  the  latter  part  of  the  year.  Amid  the  fast  adaptation  towards  the  'new  normal',  several  labour"
"market indicators also improved during 2021 compared to 2020, yet the labour market has not reached the"
"pre-pandemic levels of 2019 due to the ripple effects of the recurrent waves of the COVID-19 pandemic."
"Accordingly, employed population, especially in the Services and Agriculture sectors and the labour force"
"improved,  while  the  unemployment  rate  declined  during  2021  compared  to  the  previous  year.  With  this"
"backdrop,  Services  activities  entered  a  growth  trajectory  fuelled  by  the  expansion  in  financial  services,"
"and wholesale and retail trade activities. Meanwhile, the considerable rebound in manufacturing activities"
"with  the  pent-up  demand,  locally  and  globally,  provided  the  impetus  to  drive  Industry  activities.  In  the"
"meantime, an overall  expansion was observed in  Agriculture  activities. However, certain  Agriculture  and"
"Industry activities were adversely affected by the supply-side bottlenecks that prevailed, particularly during"
"the second half of the year. The short supply of required nutrients and agrochemicals for farming led to a"
"lower yield in agricultural crops towards the latter part of the year, despite the favourable weather prevailed."
"Further, business surveys revealed that soaring raw material prices and delays in shipments coupled with"
"foreign exchange shortage gummed up the supply chain, thereby disrupting production plans. Particularly,"
"the  full  potential  of  the  construction  industry  was  largely  hindered  by  the  inadequacy  of  key  materials."
"Meanwhile,  on  the  expenditure  front,  both  consumption  and  investment  expenditure  picked  up  in  2021,"
"with the gradual normalisation of economic activities in the country. However, net external demand further"
"contracted during the year as the surge in imports outstripped the growth in exports. Meanwhile, the national"
"savings-investment gap as a percentage of GDP widened during the year, largely due to the higher growth"
"in investment expenditure."
