2.1 OverviewT

he Sri Lankan economy rebounded by 3.7 per cent in 2021, recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic induced fall back of 3.6 per cent in 2020, amid fresh threats from new variants of the pandemic. The recovery could be observed across all three major economic activities, namely Agriculture, Industry and Services, propelled by the pent-up demand and the gradual easing of pandemic-related disturbances, and also aided by the favourable base effect that resulted from the significant contraction in the economy in 2020. Nonetheless, the fast spread of the highly infectious Delta variant put the recovery at risk, particularly during the third quarter of the year, adversely affecting Services and Industry activities. While grappling with renewed flare-ups, focused mobility restrictions coupled with policy stimuli and the countrywide vaccination rollout encouraged embracing a normal routing and provided more room for economic activities towards the latter part of the year. Amid the fast adaptation towards the 'new normal', several labour market indicators also improved during 2021 compared to 2020, yet the labour market has not reached the pre-pandemic levels of 2019 due to the ripple effects of the recurrent waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, employed population, especially in the Services and Agriculture sectors and the labour force improved, while the unemployment rate declined during 2021 compared to the previous year. With this backdrop, Services activities entered a growth trajectory fuelled by the expansion in financial services, and wholesale and retail trade activities. Meanwhile, the considerable rebound in manufacturing activities with the pent-up demand, locally and globally, provided the impetus to drive Industry activities. In the meantime, an overall expansion was observed in Agriculture activities. However, certain Agriculture and Industry activities were adversely affected by the supply-side bottlenecks that prevailed, particularly during the second half of the year. The short supply of required nutrients and agrochemicals for farming led to a lower yield in agricultural crops towards the latter part of the year, despite the favourable weather prevailed. Further, business surveys revealed that soaring raw material prices and delays in shipments coupled with foreign exchange shortage gummed up the supply chain, thereby disrupting production plans. Particularly, the full potential of the construction industry was largely hindered by the inadequacy of key materials. Meanwhile, on the expenditure front, both consumption and investment expenditure picked up in 2021, with the gradual normalisation of economic activities in the country. However, net external demand further contracted during the year as the surge in imports outstripped the growth in exports. Meanwhile, the national savings-investment gap as a percentage of GDP widened during the year, largely due to the higher growth

in investment expenditure.

2.2 Gross Domestic Product (GDP),1 Gross National Income (GNI) and GDP Per Capita

The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at both

current market prices (current prices) and

constant (2010) market prices (constant prices)

grew during 2021, as the economy leaped back

from the pandemic driven contraction recorded

in 2020. GDP at constant prices grew by 3.7 per cent

to Rs. 9,881.4 billion in 2021, compared to

3.6 per cent contraction recorded in 2020.

Meanwhile, GDP at current prices was estimated

at Rs. 16,809.3 billion (US dollars 84.5 billion

in 2021, recording a notable increase of

11.9 per cent compared to 2020, where it stood at

Rs. 15,027.4 billion (US dollars 81.0 billion). The

higher growth in GDP at current prices mainly

reflects the impact of increased price levels during

the year. Accordingly, the GDP implicit deflator

increased to 7.9 per cent in 2021, from 4.0 per cent

recorded in 2020.

GNI, which is estimated by adjusting GDP

for the net primary income from the rest of the

world, recorded a growth of 12.3 per cent at

current prices in 2021, compared to the marginal

growth of 0.3 per cent recorded in 2020. This

growth in GNI was largely due to the decline in

negative balance of net primary income on top of

the significant increase in GDP at current prices in

2021, compared to last year.

GDP per capita increased to Rs. 758,680

(US dollars 3,815) in 2021, compared to

Rs. 685,587 (US dollars 3,695) in 2020. The increase

in GDP per capita in rupee terms was mainly on

account of the growth in GDP at current prices, while

the slower increase in GDP per capita in US dollar

terms was due to the weakening of the domestic

currency against the US dollar on an annual average

basis. Meanwhile, GNI per capita was estimated at

Rs. 740,328 (US dollars 3,722) in 2021, compared to

Rs. 666,285 (US dollars 3,591) in 2020.

2.3 Contribution from

Institutional Sectors

In 2021, the largest contribution to Gross

Value Added (GVA) estimated at current market

prices continued to be from the Households

and Non-Profit Institutions Serving Households

(HH and NPISH) sector. The HH and NPISH sector

sustained the largest contribution to Agriculture

and Services activities, while Industry activities

were dominated by the Non-Financial Corporations

(NFC) sector. Accordingly, representing 48.0 per

cent of the overall GVA of the economy, the HH

and NPISH sector grew by 10.2 per cent in 2021

compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, the

NFC sector recorded a growth of 15.2 per cent.

The General Government (GG) and Financial

Corporations (FC) sectors recorded growth rates

of 5.4 per cent and 19.0 per cent, respectively, in

2021.

2.4 Output, Policies, Institutional Support and Issues

Agriculture

Agriculture activities recorded an expansion

of 2.0 per cent in 2021 in value-added terms,

recovering from the contraction of 2.2 per cent

recorded in 2020, mainly on account of the

expansion in coconut and animal production

activities. Further, the growing of tea, spices,

forestry and logging, and growing of other cereals

also expanded during the year, contributing

favourably to the growth in overall agricultural

activities. Meanwhile, fishing activities also recorded

a moderate growth in 2021, recovering from the

significant contraction recorded in 2020. However,

the growing of rice, fruits, vegetables, other perennial

crops, rubber and other beverage crops (coffee,

cocoa, etc.) contracted during the year. Even though

Agriculture activities recorded an expansion during the

year, the lack of relevant nutrients and agrochemicals

prevented it from reaching its full potential particularly

during the second half of the year.

Agriculture Production Index

The Agriculture Production Index (API),

which measures the output of the agriculture

and fisheries sectors,2 recorded a moderate

increase in 2021. The API increased by 3.0 per cent

during the year over a 2.7 per cent increase in 2020

driven by the growth in most of the sub-indices,

including paddy, tea, coconut, livestock and fisheries,

whereas the rubber sub index witnessed a contraction

in comparison to the previous year.

Paddy

The paddy sector recorded a high level of

production in 2021, with a bumper harvest

during the 2021 Yala season. Conducive weather

conditions and an increase in the net extent

harvested contributed to the increased production

2 API does not cover the forestry and logging sector

during the year. Accordingly, total paddy production

recorded a bumper harvest for the second

consecutive year in 2021, with a marginal increase

in harvest compared to the previous year. Paddy

production during the year grew by 0.6 per cent,

on a year-on-year basis, to 5.1 million metric tons.

Notably, the decline of 4.2 per cent in production

of 2020/2021 Maha season was greatly offset by

the growth of 8.5 per cent recorded in the 2021

Yala season. The net extent harvested expanded

by 2.8 per cent to 681,521 hectares and 10.3 per

cent to 445,084 hectares in the 2020/2021 Maha

and 2021 Yala seasons, respectively, resulting in

an overall increase of 5.6 per cent in the total net

extent harvested over 2020. Despite the overall

improvement in production during the year, the

paddy yield per hectare during the 2020/2021

Maha season and 2021 Yala season decreased by

6.8 per cent to 4,492 kilogrammes per hectare and

1.6 per cent to 4,692 kilogrammes per hectare,

respectively, over the corresponding periods of 2020,

raising concerns about the sufficiency of supplies of

inputs, including fertiliser and other agrochemicals,

and poor soil and crop management practices. The

total paddy production from both the Maha and

Yala seasons was equivalent to 3.3 million metric

tons of rice, which was estimated to be sufficient to

meet the domestic demand for rice approximately

for 17 months.3 Despite sufficient production, rice

imports registered a notable increase from 15,770

metric tons in 2020 to 147,091 metric tons in 2021,

of which around 134,716 metric tons of rice were

imported during the months of November and

December 2021. Rice imports were undertaken with

the intention of stabilising the upward volatilities in

rice prices observed in the domestic market and

also to ensure that a sufficient buffer stock was

maintained.

Despite sufficient levels of paddy production

and higher rice imports, prices of paddy and rice

varieties remained notably high throughout the

year. The average price of Samba paddy recorded

a significant increase of 29.2 per cent reaching

Rs. 65.32 per kilogramme during 2021, while the

average price of Nadu paddy also increased by

20.7 per cent to Rs. 57.61 per kilogramme in 2021,

compared to the previous year. The Government

continued its paddy purchasing programme, as

spearheaded by the Paddy Marketing Board

(PMB), in order to ensure fair prices to farmers.

Accordingly, with effect from March 2021, the PMB

purchased paddy at the price of Rs. 56.50 per

kilogramme for all varieties, which was later revised

to Rs. 50.00 per kilogramme for Nadu, Rs. 52.00 per

kilogramme for Samba, and Rs. 55.00 per kilogramme

for Keeri Samba in July 2021. Further, the guaranteed

price for Nadu was further increased to Rs. 55.00 per

kilogramme in September 2021. The PMB purchased

around 44,948 metric tons of paddy stock from the

2020/2021 Maha harvest, while around 7,728 metric

tons were purchased during the 2021 Yala season.

Further, necessary approval was granted in February

2022 to purchase paddy for the 2021/2022 Maha

season at Rs. 90.00 per kilogramme for Nadu,

Rs. 92.00 per kilogramme for Samba, and Rs. 95.00

per kilogramme for Keeri Samba with the view to

providing competitive prices for paddy farmers. The

PMB expects to purchase around 300,000 metric

tons of paddy during the 2021/2022 Maha season,

and as of mid-March 2022, around 70,000 metric

tons had been purchased. However, as the efficiency

of the paddy purchasing programme of the PMB is

constrained due to a host of factors such as the lack

of infrastructure and logistics, including warehouse

facilities, drying, and transportation facilities, private

millers were able to buy significantly higher quantities

of paddy at competitive prices in the open market. On

average, the retail price of Samba was Rs. 136.52

per kilogramme in 2021, which was an increase of

30.8 per cent, compared to the previous year, while

the average retail price of Nadu stood at Rs. 116.56

per kilogramme in 2021 in comparison to Rs. 100.01

per kilogramme reported in the previous year. Due

to high price volatilities and to prevent exploitation

of consumers amidst these developments, a

Gazette was issued on 02 September 2021 setting

a maximum retail price (MRP) for Samba rice at

Rs.103.00 per kilogramme and Nadu rice at

Rs.98.00 per kilogramme. However, this Gazette

was later revoked towards end September 2021

leading to a price escalation thereon. Meanwhile,

the Special Commodity Levy on imported Samba,

Nadu, and Raw rice was reduced, considerably, from

Rs. 65.00 to Rs. 0.25 per kilogramme from October

2021 to June 2022 with the aim of ensuring a sufficient

and continuous supply of rice in the market.

Several measures were undertaken across

the agriculture sector to uplift productivity in

a sustainable manner in line with the National

Policy Framework of the Government. With

due consideration to the negative consequences

of excessive use of agro chemicals, a ban on

the importation of chemical fertilisers, pesticides

and herbicides was imposed in May 2021. In this

regard, several programmes were carried out for

the expeditious adoption of sustainable agriculture

practices, while encouraging local production of

organic fertiliser, which gathered pace gradually.

However, this swift policy move resulted in limited

availability of inorganic and organic fertilisers,

creating concerns of sizeable yield losses in paddy

cultivation and causing escalations in the price of

paddy. Therefore, measures were taken to import

natural organic fertiliser, chelated minerals, and

micronutrients for paddy cultivation. The Government

also planned to import Muriate of Potash for paddy

cultivation during the 2022 Yala season. Another key

initiative to encourage organic agricultural practices

was the provision of an incentive of Rs.12,500 per

hectare, capped at a maximum of one hectare, to

farmers who produce organic fertiliser for their own

paddy cultivation in the 2021/2022 Maha season.

Further, organic and bio fertilisers were provided

as subsidies for the 2021/2022 Maha season in

order to address soil nutrient deficiencies in the

paddy fields, while also assisting farmers to produce

their own compost fertiliser for their usage. In this

regard, laboratory facilities were made available to

ensure the quality of compost fertiliser. Rice variety

screening for organic cultivation was also carried out

encompassing 10 popular varieties and 4 traditional

varieties to select the best performing varieties.

Creating new crosses and evaluating breeding lines

were also carried out under the Crop Improvement

Programme, while the Production and Productivity

Enhancement of Paddy Project was continued

with the aim of implementing a suite of agriculture

technologies spanning the entire cultivation process

starting from land preparation to harvest.

Tea

The production of tea recorded an overall

growth of 7.4 per cent in 2021, driven by a

significant expansion during the first half of the

year, owing mainly to the lower base induced

by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the

corresponding period of 2020. Following the

significant increase of 24.0 per cent recorded in

the first half of the year, a sharp contraction of

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

62

7.2 per cent was registered in tea production

during the latter half of the year, largely driven by

unfavourable weather conditions that prevailed

during the months of November and December.

Production of high, medium, and low grown tea,

which contributes to about 22 per cent, 17 per

cent and 61 per cent of the total production,

respectively, expanded by 5.0 per cent, 9.1 per

cent and 7.8 per cent, respectively, in 2021. In the

meantime, the average yield in the smallholder

sector increased to 1,880 kilogrammes per

hectare, compared to 1,766 kilogrammes per

hectare reported in 2020 and remained above the

average yield of the large plantation sector.

Tea prices at the Colombo Tea Auction

(CTA) remained elevated in 2021 compared to

pre pandemic levels, but were still lower than

those observed in 2020. The average price

of tea decreased by 2.3 per cent to Rs. 619.15

per kilogramme during the year from Rs. 633.85

per kilogramme recorded in 2020. Accordingly,

average tea prices of medium and low grown

tea declined by 1.0 per cent and 3.5 per cent,

year-on-year, respectively, while high grown

tea reported a marginal increase of 0.6 per cent

in 2021. Further, the average price received

by smallholders for green leaves declined to

Rs. 93.67 per kilogramme during the year from

Rs. 94.36 per kilogramme in 2020. Although the

average export price (FOB) of tea increased by

6.2 per cent to Rs. 920.76 per kilogramme

during the year, the FOB price of tea in US dollar

terms declined by 0.9 per cent during 2021. The

dampening of average tea prices during the year

can be partly attributed to the improvement in tea

production as well as the increase in the quantity

supplied to the auction during the year. Further,

sharp increases in freight costs and other input

costs, such as packing materials, adversely

impacted prices during the year.

Several measures were undertaken by the

Government to strengthen the tea industry in

2021. The Five Year Strategic and Action Plan for the

Tea Sector in Sri Lanka (2021-2025) was finalised

and actions were executed as planned during

the year. The transition to an e-Auction system,

which was a major stepping stone for the tea trade

when initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic in

2020, continued to operate successfully and was

upgraded as ‘SmartAuction’ with strengthened

trading and data features in 2021. Under the

replanting, new planting, and infilling subsidy

programme to increase the productivity of tea

lands, the Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB) disbursed

Rs. 79.8 million for 263 hectares across tea growing

regions. The SLTB continued the Model Tea Garden

project for middle scale tea estates, while providing

Rs. 2.3 million for 17 lands and expects to establish

138 tea nurseries, of which 113 nurseries had been

established as at the end of the year. The Cabinet

of Ministers granted approval to utilise Rs. 1 billion

from the Tea Promotion and Marketing Fund of

the SLTB to provide a grant for tea exporters who

are eligible under the Brand Promotion Scheme

for the exporting of Pure Ceylon Tea. A tripartite

agreement worth euros 1 million was signed by the

SLTB to obtain financial and technical assistance

in relation to obtaining a Geographical Indication

(GI) certification for Ceylon Tea, which is expected

to serve to recognise the quality and the unique

characteristics of the product, as attributable to

Sri Lanka. The Tea Small Holdings Development

Authority (TSHDA) continued its efforts in relation

to tea replanting and new planting programmes

and crop rehabilitation subsidy programmes. In

2021, around 849 hectares of tea lands were

replanted and about 678 hectares of new lands

were converted into tea lands, while 3.3 million

tea plants were used for infilling vacancies in

tea lands. After a hiatus of over five years, the

tea replanting subsidy for tea smallholders

was increased to Rs. 630,000 per hectare

from Rs. 500,000 per hectare, while the new

planting subsidy was increased to Rs. 500,000

per hectare from Rs. 400,000 per hectare.

The Tea Research Institute (TRI) continued to

execute research and development activities

and service projects in line with its Strategic Plan

(2019-2023), which strives to strengthen the sector

in line with the Sustainable Development Goals,

Five Year Strategic and Action Plan for Tea and

the National Policy Framework of the Government.

Rubber

Rubber production continued to decrease in

2021 due to incessant rains in plantation areas,

during tapping days along with the prevalence of

fungal disease. Accordingly, production declined

by 1.7 per cent to 76.9 million kilogrammes in 2021

from 78.2 million kilogrammes produced in 2020.

Rubber production showed a rising trend during the

first half of 2021, but declined notably thereafter.

This was due to higher number of rainy days which

dampened production in the last quarter of the year,

which is generally considered as the peak yielding

period of rubber plantations. The production

of sheet rubber, which accounts for about 50

per cent of total rubber production, declined by 1.7

per cent, while crepe rubber production recorded

a growth of 7.4 per cent during the period under

review. The production of other categories of

rubber, which accounts for around 32 per cent of

total rubber production, declined by 6.2 per cent

in comparison to the production of the previous

year. In 2021, domestic consumption of rubber

by local industries increased by 19.4 per cent

to 133.9 million kilogrammes with the gradual

recovery of the industry sector. Meanwhile, exports

of raw rubber recorded a marginal decline of 1.7

per cent to 15.5 million kilogrammes in 2021, owing

to low production.

Reflecting the escalation of natural rubber

prices in global markets, rubber prices in the

domestic market also displayed an increasing

trend during 2021. At the Colombo Rubber

Auction, the average price of Ribbed Smoked

Sheet No.1 (RSS1) rubber increased by 31.1 per

cent to Rs. 460.78 per kilogramme, while prices of

latex crepe witnessed a significant increase of 74.4

per cent to Rs. 626.32 per kilogramme in 2021 over

the prices recorded in 2020. Meanwhile, average

auction prices of RSS1 and latex crepe rubber

stood at Rs. 475.00 per kilogramme and Rs. 696.58

per kilogramme, respectively, as at end December

2021. Average FOB price of rubber also increased

from US dollars 1.91 per kilogramme in 2020 to US

dollars 2.72 per kilogramme in 2021. The surge in

international prices during the latter part of the year

was driven by supply shortages in global markets

due to unseasonal and heavy rains that disrupted

tapping operations in rubber producers amidst

growing demand from East Asia.

The strategies that were implemented by

the Rubber Development Department (RDD)

and the Rubber Research Institute (RRI) for the

development of the rubber sector continued in

2021, aiming at improving sectoral productivity

as well as raising the value addition in the

rubber industry. In line with the National

Agricultural Policy, Rs. 60 million was allocated in

Budget 2021 to provide subsidies for local small

and medium scale entrepreneurs to engage in

natural rubber related production and to transform

small rubber lands into profitable commercial units

by encouraging diversification of income streams.

Under the Productivity Improvement Programme

initiated by the RDD in 2020, targeting the small

holding sector, activities related to new planting,

replanting, preparation of abandoned land for

tapping and enhancing productivity of lands were

underway, while subsidies were provided for

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

64

re-cultivation of abandoned lands, and to

purchase rain guards and weeding equipment.

Further, continued efforts were made in relation

to new planting activities in non-traditional rubber

cultivation areas, including Moneragala and

Ampara districts, under the Smallholder Tea and

Rubber Revitalisation (STaRR) Project. As a part

of its research and development activities, the RRI

introduced an environment friendly and economically

viable slow release fertiliser technique to improve

crop performance across 14 estates under the

Pussellawa, Agalawatta, Kelani Valley, and Kegalle

plantations and 6 smallholder sites. The RRI also

conducted 64 on-farm participatory research trials

for compost application, covering a total extent of

131.8 acres in the Kalutara, Kurunegala, Matale,

Kegalle, Matara, Galle, Colombo, and Ratnapura

districts. Moreover, the Ministry of Plantation

established an Inter-institutional Coordinating

Committee for Development of Rubber Cultivation

and Industries, comprising representatives of

relevant ministries and institutions, with the intention

of devising holistic policies to develop and strengthen

the rubber industry and relevant value chains.

Coconut

Coconut production reached a historically

high level with total nut production of 3,120

million nuts in 2021. Accordingly, coconut

production recorded a growth of 11.7 per cent in

2021 compared to the contraction of 9.5 per cent

recorded in 2020. The increase was largely driven

by conducive weather conditions that resulted

in well distributed rainfalls from the latter part of

2020 onwards and throughout 2021, in addition to

favourable air temperature in key coconut growing

areas. As coconut production recovered from its

subdued performance in 2020, the output of major

kernel products showed improvements during the

period under review. Accordingly, the production

of desiccated coconut increased by 31.8 per cent

to 33,289 metric tons, while coconut oil production

improved significantly by 117.8 per cent in 2021,

compared to 2020. The increase in coconut oil

production was a result of the policy initiatives

of the Government to promote local coconut oil

production, while discouraging the importation

and consumption of palm oil and other edible oil

imports. Production of coconut cream, coconut

milk, and coconut milk powder also increased in

2021. Despite the increase in production of total

nuts, copra and fresh nut exports dropped in 2021,

amidst growing industrial demand for processed

products. Meanwhile, steps were taken to import

frozen coconut kernel for coconut based industries,

as local production was insufficient to meet the

growing demand of the industry sector.

Prices of coconut and coconut based

products remained at an elevated level

during 2021 amid the high levels of coconut

production reflecting the demand emerging

from coconut based industries. Accordingly,

the average auction price of coconut at the

Colombo Coconut Auction increased to Rs. 56.51

per nut in 2021 from Rs. 48.89 per nut in 2020.

The average retail price of coconut increased

by 13.7 per cent to Rs. 83.90 per nut over 2020.

Although the Government imposed MRPs for

coconuts, in September 2020 ranging from Rs. 60

to Rs 70, based on circumference, coconuts were

sold above the controlled prices in local markets,

resulting in the revocation of price controls in June

2021. With the notable drop in edible oil imports

and increase in edible oil prices in the global

market, the average domestic price of coconut

oil increased by 29.2 per cent to Rs. 443.42 per

750 ml bottle in 2021. The average local market

price of desiccated coconut also increased further

during the year to Rs. 537.25 per kilogramme

compared to Rs. 447.56 per kilogramme recorded

in the previous year.

The Government took a series of measures

to improve productivity of coconut lands

through initiatives focused on the creation

of a sustainable coconut cultivation system.

Accordingly, the Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB)

introduced a special subsidy scheme in 2021 to

rehabilitate existing coconut lands using organic

manure, soil mulching, and moisture conservation

techniques. Also, the scheme for provision of

coconut seedlings at a subsidised rate for systematic

cultivation continued during the year. Steps were

taken to establish efficient irrigation systems in

coconut lands through a new subsidy system that

supports the construction of micro irrigation systems,

hose irrigation systems, and water sources in

coconut lands. This is expected to help mitigate the

effects of adverse weather on coconut cultivation.

During the year, the Coconut Research Institute

(CRI) also engaged in several activities relating

to the production of genetically superior hybrid

coconut seed nuts and the establishment of a new

coconut seed garden to produce the high yielding

Kapsuwaya hybrid coconut cultivar. The CRI also

engaged in initiatives pertaining to the estimation of

organic fertiliser requirements for coconut cultivation

and the standardisation of solid and liquid organic

fertiliser. The Coconut Development Authority

(CDA) continued to offer support to coconut based

industries by facilitating financial support to coconut

product manufacturers and entrepreneurs, while

ensuring continuous improvement in diversification

and manufacture of value added coconut products.

Minor Export Crops

The growth momentum of minor export

crops continued in 2021, despite COVID-19

related global supply chain interruptions.

According to the provisional estimates of the

Department of Export Agriculture (DEA), the

production of minor export crops increased by

28.6 per cent in 2021 over 2020. Restrictions

imposed by the Government on the importation of

spices encouraged farmers to actively engage in

cultivation, resulting in improved performance of

the sector. The production of cinnamon, pepper,

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

66

clove, cardamom, coffee, cocoa, and nutmeg

registered growths in 2021, while the production of

betel declined marginally in 2021. Further, prices

for pepper increased significantly following the rise

in global demand for the crop, thereby providing

financial relief to cultivators who had been suffering

from low prices since 2016. With the initiation of

the Accelerated Turmeric Cultivation Development

Programme by the Government, turmeric cultivation

expanded significantly during 2021 in line with the

Government’s goals of achieving self-sufficiency

in the crop. Reflecting improved production, the

export agriculture crop sector recorded its highest

performance in 2021 with total export volume of

the sector registering an increase of 20.4 per cent,

while export earnings increased by 41.0 per cent,

in rupee terms, during the year.

Several measures targeted at generating

foreign earnings by enhancing the quality and

productivity of export agricultural crops were

adopted to uplift the performance of the export

agriculture sector. Research and development

activities relating to the expansion of cultivation

of pepper, arecanut, ginger, turmeric, and betel

in non-traditional areas such as Anuradhapura,

Polonnaruwa, Ampara, Vavuniya and Jaffna

continued in 2021. The DEA continued to implement

initiatives to enhance the quality of production,

including the introduction and popularisation of

organic cultivation, Good Agricultural Practices

(GAP), and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).

Further, a number of development programmes,

such as productivity improvement programmes,

crop specific development programmes, and

organic cultivation promotion programmes, were

conducted in 2021 to assist in the establishment of

economically productive cultivations. Technology

related guidance and support were provided to

farmers with the aim of enhancing post harvest

practices and to induct them into value adding

activities using appropriate technologies.

Cultivators were also provided with assistance

to obtain quality certifications, and organic

certifications through the organic cultivation

promotion programme.

Other Field Crops

The production of Other Field Crops (OFCs)

increased due to favourable weather conditions

and rising demand for domestic produce, amidst

bans on imports of these crops. Accordingly, in

2021, the overall production of OFCs increased

by 27.3 per cent, year-on-year, to 843,297 metric

tons, of which a significant portion was driven by

the growth of 41.9 per cent registered during the

2020/2021 Maha season. The 2021 Yala season

recorded an increase of 2.0 per cent over the

previous Yala season. Domestic production of OFCs

such as maize, finger millet (kurakkan), potato, big

onion, green gram, black gram, ground nut and

gingelly recorded an increase, while the production

of red onion, green chillies, cowpea, soya bean

and sorghum recorded a decline. Maize production

registered a significant increase of 50.7 per cent

to 472,444 metric tons during the year compared

to 2020, as a result of several strengthening

programmes conducted by the Government in

order to improve domestic maize production. Also,

importation of maize decreased by 47.8 per cent in

2021, due to measures undertaken to curb maize

importation. Potato production, which declined by

36.0 per cent in 2020, rebounded with a growth of

16.6 per cent in 2021, while potato imports dropped

by 8.0 per cent over 2020. Further, big onion

production increased by 53.2 per cent to 65,907

metric tons compared to the previous year and

importation of big onions decreased by 3.2 per cent

to 257,421 metric tons in 2021. In the meantime,

the Government adopted several measures to

enhance domestic production of OFCs via specific

2

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE, INCOME AND EMPLOYMENT

67

production improvement initiatives, on top of the

continuous support offered through the distribution

of seeds and planting materials. Accordingly, during

the year, the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) continued

the construction of 102 island wide warehouses for

OFCs, of which 76 projects had been completed

as at end of 2021, with the aim of providing short-

term storage facilities to farmers under the national

programme to pave the way for improved food

security, while also ensuring a fair price for crops.

The Department of Agriculture (DoA) continued

its efforts to promote GAPs, expand the extent of

cultivation of OFCs, improve pest management

techniques, and increase the usage of high yielding

seeds, while focusing on improvements to water

management. In order to strengthen domestic food

security, further efforts are required to improve

the supply of all OFCs by way of promoting seed

production, optimal usage of agricultural inputs

such as fertiliser and pesticides, expanding storage

capacity, adopting best practices on climate resilient

agriculture, increasing integration into value chains

and establishing new marketing platforms.

Vegetables

The supply of vegetables declined in 2021

owing to the combined impact of inclement

weather, the fertiliser shortage, and increased

machinery and transportation costs. The total

production of vegetables decreased by 1.4 per cent

to 1,669,515 metric tons in 2021, in comparison

to 1,693,095 metric tons recorded in 2020. This

decline was mainly due to the lower production of

vegetables during the 2020/2021 Maha season

during which a contraction of 2.5 per cent to 871,729

metric tons was observed over the previous Maha

season. Meanwhile, the 2021 Yala production also

marginally declined by 0.2 per cent to 797,786

metric tons, compared to the corresponding season

of 2020. The low production and disruptions in the

supply chain resulted in the volatility of vegetable

prices throughout the year. Accordingly, vegetable

prices remained elevated during the year except

for slight declines seen in the months of March

and September due to the seasonal harvest.

Towards the end of the year, vegetable prices

increased sharply, surpassing the seasonal price

patterns, owing to the crop damages and supply

chain disruptions caused by heavy rains, fertiliser

shortage, and spread of pests and diseases due

to the shortage of agro chemicals. Meanwhile,

21,540 metric tons of vegetables worth US dollars

28.5 million were exported, while 697,144 metric

tons of vegetables worth US dollars 384.3 million

were imported during 2021. Moreover, several

government authorities continued to undertake

measures to promote and strengthen domestic

vegetable production during the year. The

National Institute of Post-Harvest Management

functioning under the MoA carried out several

research and development projects, training and

awareness programmes, and consultancy services

to improve the adoption of technology, while

assessing the impact of such technology-centric

techniques on post-harvest management and their

spillover effects on strengthening agribusiness

development and improving food security. In early

2022, the Government initiated a national level

programme for home gardening with the support

of eight government agencies in order to increase

vegetable and fruit production, and ensure food

security.

Fruits

According to the provisional estimates of the

Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), the

production of fruits was estimated at 3.3 million

metric tons in 2021. During the year under review,

43,426 metric tons of fruits, worth US dollars 38.0

million were exported, while 55,725 metric tons

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

68

of fruits, valued at US dollars 67.6 million were

imported. The top three fruit exports comprised

bananas, papaws and pineapples, while the top

three fruit imports comprised apples, grapes and

oranges. Despite the robust demand for local

fruits, local producers possess limited capacity to

cater to domestic demand. Accordingly, several

measures were implemented by the MoA and DoA

to enhance productivity, storage and distribution

facilities and optimal usage of agricultural inputs,

while ensuring the reduction of post-harvest

losses. In June 2021, the MoA implemented a

programme for District Secretaries or Government

Agents to purchase stocks of vegetables and fruits

that could not be conveniently sold, due to the

imposition of mobility restrictions. Vegetables and

fruits were to be purchased at prices determined

by the respective District Price Committee thereby

ensuring that farmers receive a fair price for their

production. In March 2022, the Government took

steps to limit the importation of several fruits,

including oranges, mandarins, grapes, and apples

as part of its measures to curb high expenditure on

non-essential imports.

Sugar

Sugar production continued its upward

trend in 2021 supported by favourable rainfall

patterns and expanded cultivation extent. The

total volume of sugar produced at the Sevanagala,

Pelwatte, and Gal Oya sugar factories recorded

a further increase of 17.9 per cent to 70,606

metric tons in 2021, over the growth of 14.5 per

cent recorded in 2020. Accordingly, during the

period under review, the production across the

Sevanagala, Pelwatte, and Gal Oya sugar factories

grew by 10.4 per cent, 28.8 per cent, and 11.2 per

cent, respectively. The total extent under sugarcane

cultivation (including ratoons) managed by the

factories also increased by 3.5 per cent during the

year. Further, the Ethimale Plantations, which has

commenced production activities is expected to

make significant contributions to domestic sugar

production in the near future. Meanwhile, re-

establishment activities pertaining to the Kantale

sugar factory and the sugarcane plantation were

in progress, albeit at a modest pace due to legal

issues. Although total sugar production and average

yield increased in 2021, sugar productivity, as

measured by the sugar recovery rate,4 decreased

in 2021. These may be attributed to poor irrigation

management, particularly during harvesting time,

and inefficiencies in the quality based cane pricing

system along with improper sampling systems in

sugar factories.

Several strategies were implemented in

the sugar industry, focused on productivity

improvements in existing plantations and

expansion of cultivation. Considering the

high level of sugar imports over low domestic

production, efforts to expand sugarcane plantations

through provision of seed cane, establishment of

multiplication plots and nurseries in various cane

growing areas, and crop improvement and resource

management practices continued throughout the

year. In compliance with the Government's policy

guidelines, several development programmes

related to the shift away from inorganic farming

practices and towards organic farming practices

were in progress during the year. These included

the introduction of organic fertiliser and biochemical

and bio-control measures, and the formulation of

a site-specific fertiliser recommendation model

for sugarcane-growing soils. Meanwhile, the

Sugarcane Research Institute (SRI) continued to

undertake initiatives related to the setting up of new

sugarcane factories in Weli Oya, Horowpathana

and Bibile, while expanding sugarcane cultivation

in the Skandhapuram area in Kilinochchi. The SRI

actively engaged in the process of updating the

National Sugar Sector Development Policy, which

was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in 2016,

to better reflect the current global and domestic

situation. In light of the sharp rise in global sugar

prices and the substantial foreign exchange spent

on sugar imports, it is vital that the Government

collaborates with these institutions to undertake

a timely restructuring of the sugar industry,

while exploring the potential for expansion of

production capacity through the use of improved

varieties, better agronomic practices and modern

technologies.

Livestock

The performance of the livestock sector

showed signs of improvement during 2021.

According to the estimates of the DCS, the total

national milk production grew by 4.4 per cent

to 513 million litres in 2021. The growth in milk

production was mainly driven by an increase in

the average producer price of cow milk, increased

milk collection, and the addition of new dairy

farms. The average cost of production of cow

milk increased to Rs. 69.30 per litre in 2021 from

Rs. 49.28 per litre recorded in the preceding year

owing to the increased price of concentrate feed

and high labour charges. However, due to the

increased demand for liquid milk stemming from

shortages of imported and domestic milk powder

and the significant increases in milk powder

prices, the price received by farmers for locally

produced liquid milk was also relatively high

during the year. Accordingly, the average farm

gate price of a litre of cow milk increased from

Rs. 82.00 in 2020 to Rs. 98.00 in 2021. As per

the Department of Animal Production and Health

(DAPH), the contribution of local milk production

to meeting the country's total requirement stood

at around 38 per cent in 2021. In the poultry

sector, egg production witnessed a growth of

4.5 per cent in 2021 compared to the previous year.

However, the lack of feed ingredients and rising

feed costs translated into reductions in the size

and the number of eggs produced per bird. Further,

poultry meat production increased by 9.5 per cent,

while the cost of production of chicken increased

from Rs. 342.07 per kilogramme to Rs. 434.19 per

kilogramme in 2021. The local production of

broiler parents broadly remained unchanged,

while importation of broiler parents increased,

resulting in a higher availability of broiler parent

day-old chicks in 2021. During the period under

review, the production of beef, pork and mutton

increased by 4.4 per cent, 4.9 per cent and 1.0 per

cent, respectively.

The Government continued to promote the

livestock sector by implementing necessary

measures and providing policy support during

the year. Under the Livestock Breeding Project of

the DAPH, around 196,364 artificial inseminations

were carried out on cattle and buffalos during 2021

through divisional veterinary offices. Provision

of cattle feed to improve the nutrition of female

calves born through artificial insemination and

vaccination against various animal diseases were

also in progress during the period under review.

Further, under the Comprehensive Mastitis Control

Programme, udder infusions were produced

locally and issued to the dairy farmers to control

and prevent clinical and subclinical mastitis in

the national herd. Despite several initiatives to

improve the dairy industry, the local dairy industry

largely comprises small scale dairy producers,

with average production levels ranging from 2-3

litres per day. Poor feeding practices along with

the reduction in locally produced feed ingredients,

higher calving intervals and breeding issues,

inadequate infrastructure for milk storage, cooling,

transportation and processing, and poor health

status of cows continued to contribute to low

productivity. Considering the country's urgent need

for dairy sector development, upgrading the dairy

industry to medium and large-scale farms, as well

as ensuring the availability of high quality feed at

affordable prices, establishing a cost reflective

price mechanism for milk and milk products, and

increasing the productivity of existing herds could

greatly facilitate fulfillment of the domestic demand

for milk and milk products. On the other hand,

domestic maize production, which is largely used

as the primary ingredient in domestic poultry feed

production, is still insufficient to fulfill total demand,

there by creating difficulties in obtaining required

feed and forcing feed producers to turn to high cost

substitutes and resulting in feed price fluctuations

and a significant drop in feed production.

Accordingly, small scale poultry producers have

become more vulnerable to market pressures.

Therefore, encouraging domestic maize cultivation

and introducing technology to increase productivity

remain critical in ensuring the long term viability

of the poultry sector, while also ensuring that

temporary supply shortages are addressed in a

timely manner.

Fisheries

The production of the fisheries sector

remained subdued in 2021 following the steep

contraction observed in 2020. Accordingly,

marine fish production, which comprises coastal

and off shore sub sectors and accounts for around

76 per cent of the total fish production, increased by

1.5 per cent. Inland fishery production increased by

2.4 per cent mainly driven by the increase in shrimp

farm production coupled with improved aquaculture

practices. Meanwhile, during the second and third

quarters of 2021, fish production was affected by

the disruptions to marine fishing activities due to the

Xpress Pearl vessel incident that caused significant

damage to coastal and marine resources. The

authorities took immediate measures to impose a

temporary fishing ban in the affected areas from

Kalutara to Negombo to ensure the safety of the

fishing community and the consumers. Subsequently,

the Government disbursed an allowance of

Rs. 5,000 per affected family, while offering

replacements for damaged fishing gear so as to

safeguard the livelihoods of fishing communities.

However, fish production and consumption

witnessed a rebound in the fourth quarter of

2021. The retail price of fish varieties fluctuated

throughout the year as a result of disruptions to

fishing activities and increased logistics costs.

According to the Ministry of Fisheries (MoF), fish

exports increased by 25.6 per cent in volume

terms and by 58.6 per cent in rupee terms in 2021,

reflecting the impact of the measures taken by the

authorities to provide necessary guidance and

assistance to stakeholders in order to export high

quality fish products in accordance with relevant

regulations imposed by the importer countries. Fish

imports declined notably by 34.5 per cent during

the period under review.

The Government continued to undertake its

efforts aimed at increasing the contribution of

the fisheries sector to the national economy.

The MoF undertook several initiatives to enhance

fish production, while focusing on the reduction in

post harvest losses, which accounts for around 20-30

per cent of total production. Several initiatives were

also underway to prevent illegal, unreported, and

unregulated fishing activities. Construction activities

of new harbours, upgrading of existing harbours,

and construction of anchorages and landing sites

were in progress during the year to enable large

scale multiday fishing vessels to dock. Initiatives to

improve modern cooling, storage and transportation

facilities, which are essential logistics for improved

fish production were also underway during 2021. The

MoF, in collaboration with the National Aquaculture

Development Authority (NAQDA), implemented

a number of non-traditional farming initiatives to

enhance inland fish and aquaculture production,

improve exports and strengthen the rural economy.

In this regard, the establishment of community based

fish breeding units, the improvement of small scale

fish seed production units for post larvae rearing, and

the rehabilitation and improvement of aquaculture

development centers in order to increase fish

fingerling production were in progress during the year.

Initiatives to intensify shrimp culture were continued

through various measures such as the installation

of a water recirculation system, the improvement of

biosecurity in farming areas, and the dredging of the

Dutch Canal in Puttalam to access quality water. In

addition to shrimp farming, the NAQDA also engaged

in the promotion of commercial aquaculture through

the development of sea weed, sea bass, crab, sea

cucumber, and milk fish farming. Sea weed farming

activities in the Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar, and

Puttalam sea areas and the construction of a milk fish

hatchery in Puttalam were underway during the year.

A sea cucumber hatchery in Mannar commenced

operations in March 2021 and a sea cucumber village

was established in Kilinochchi, while steps were taken

to expand sea cucumber farming in Jaffna with a view

to increasing sea cucumber exports. Furthermore,

the development of new ornamental fish strains, the

advancement of aquaculture technology, and the

provision of brood fish and fish disease diagnosis

activities were also underway in order to support the

development of ornamental fish and aquatic plant

culture and export sector.

Industry

Benefiting from the pent-up demand and

the continuation of the operations under the

'new normal', Industry value-added recovered

by 5.3 per cent in 2021, from the contraction of

6.9 per cent registered in 2020, yet the figures

masked the lingering damage caused by supply-

side impediments. The recovery in manufacturing

activities led the Industry growth while construction

and, mining and quarrying activities recorded

moderate expansions. Meanwhile, electricity, gas,

steam, and air conditioning supply activities, and

water collection, treatment and supply activities also

expanded during the year, positively contributing

to overall Industry activities. However, sewerage,

waste treatment, and disposal activities contracted

in 2021. Reflecting the recovery in Industry activities,

the Demand and Production sub-indices related

to the Industry activities of the Business Outlook

Survey (BOS) conducted by the Central Bank on a

quarterly basis, indicated an expansion on average

during the year.

Manufacturing

Continuing the operations under new

normalcy, the value-added of manufacturing

activities turned to a recovery path with a

growth of 7.2 per cent in 2021, from the decline

of 3.9 per cent recorded in 2020. The successful

vaccination rollout in the country, relaxation of the

pandemic-related mobility restrictions, allowing of

continuous functioning of factory operations and

the adjustment of the economic environment to

'new normal' provided an impetus to the recovery in

manufacturing activities during the year. Accordingly,

all manufacturing activities expanded during the

year, except the manufacture of coke and refined

petroleum products which was adversely affected

by the temporary closure of the Sapugaskanda

refinery. Manufacture of textiles, wearing apparel

and leather-related products was a key contributor

to the overall growth of manufacturing activities,

largely supported by the healthy external demand.

Further, the manufacture of food, beverages, and

tobacco products, rubber and plastic products, and

other non-metallic mineral products also contributed

considerably to the expansion in manufacturing

activities. Considering the manufacturing-related

indicators, the Index of Industrial Production (IIP)

compiled by the DCS recorded an increase in

2021, indicating the recovery in manufacturing

activities. Further, the Purchasing Managers’ Index

(PMI) for manufacturing activities, compiled by the

Central Bank on a monthly basis, also indicated an

expansion of manufacturing activities on average

during the year. However, the delays in the supply

chain hindered the sector from reaching its full

potential.

Index of Industrial Production

Following a notable setback in 2020, the

manufacturing sector showed a rebound in 2021

despite the challenges brought about by the

COVID-19 pandemic. As per the Index of Industrial

Production (IIP) compiled by the DCS, with increased

production across majority of the sub sectors, the

manufacturing sector witnessed a significant growth

of 7.3 per cent in 2021 compared to the decline of

10.2 per cent observed in 2020. The highest value

of the IIP of 119.6 since its inception was reported

in March 2021. Imposition of selective and less

rigid mobility restrictions during the outbreaks of

COVID-19 in 2021 allowed major industrial activities

to continue without much disruption. The COVID-19

vaccination drive that picked up pace, especially

during the second half of the year also facilitated

the continuation of industrial activity. The positive

performance of the IIP was primarily driven by the

subsectors of manufacturing of wearing apparel,

non-metallic mineral products, rubber and plastic

products, textiles, basic metals and beverages.

However, the overall positive momentum of the IIP

was weighed down by the manufacturing of coke and

refined petroleum products subsector, on account of

occasional closures of the refinery.

Although food manufacturing activities

remained subdued during the year, beverage

manufacturing activities recorded a sizeable

growth. The modest pace of growth observed in

the largest sub-sector in the IIP, the manufacture of

food products, was largely a result of disruptions to

both domestic and global supply chains. Subsequent

to a marginal contraction of 0.8 per cent registered

during the first half of the year, the sub-sector showed

improved performance during the latter half leading

to a marginal expansion of 0.2 per cent during the

year, with increased production of chicken products,

canned fish, jam, sauce and biscuits. Beverage

manufacturing activities recorded a significant growth

of 9.8 per cent in 2021 compared to the contraction

of 6.7 per cent recorded in 2020. Improved demand

for beverages was seen in line with the restoration

of normalcy in the economy as restrictions on events

and social activities were also lifted to a great extent.

The manufacturing of wearing apparel and

textiles subsectors made strong headway

during 2021 supported by the improvements

in global supply chains, the policy decisions of

the Government to facilitate the continuation of

manufacturing activities amid pandemic related

mobility restrictions and the low base reported in

2020. The manufacture of the wearing apparel sub

sector, which accounts for around one-fifth of the

IIP, registered a significant growth of 17.5 per cent in

2021 in comparison to the sharp contraction of 30.7

per cent in the previous year. The manufacturing

of textile products also followed suit, reporting

a significant expansion of 25.9 per cent in 2021

followed by a contraction of 5.6 per cent in 2020.

The positive performances of these sub-sectors were

driven by the overall rebound in the global economy,

especially in key export destinations that enabled a

steady recovery of export demand. The abating of

disruptions to domestic and global supply chains,

which had weighed negatively on the availability of

raw materials also facilitated the growth momentum

of the sector. Meanwhile, the rapid deployment of

vaccines to workers engaged in this sector alongside

the Government’s decision to allow the continuation

of manufacturing activities amidst COVID-19 related

mobility restrictions helped minimise disruptions,

enabling the sectoral performance of manufacture of

wearing apparel and textile products to rebound.

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

74

The subsectors of manufacture of other

nonmetallic mineral products, basic metals,

and fabricated metal products registered

significant expansions of 23.0, 20.7 and 23.5

per cent respectively, in 2021 subsequent to

the COVID-19 induced contractions in 2020.

The positive performance of these subsectors

was driven by the initiatives of the Government to

improve the domestic production capacity, while

imposing import restrictions on tiles and ceramic

products. The rebound observed in the construction

sector during the year also contributed to the

improvement in demand for products from these

subsectors. Increases in the production of cement,

tiles, glass bottles, roofing sheets and porcelain

tableware were key contributors to the expansion in

production in the manufacture of other nonmetallic

mineral products subsector. In particular, the overall

expansions in the manufacture of basic metals

and the manufacture of fabricated metal products

subsectors were primarily driven by the increased

production in lead and aluminum, aluminum bars,

and steel and aluminum products.

Production of coke and refined petroleum

products witnessed a sharp decline during the

year, on top of the contraction reported in 2020,

owing to the disruptions in the operations of

the refinery of the Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation (CPC). The manufacture of coke and

refined petroleum products subsector witnessed a

contraction of 26.8 per cent during 2021 compared

to the contraction of 9.0 per cent during the

previous year. During the first half of 2021, the

refinery was shut down for almost two months for

maintenance purposes followed by a temporary

closure of almost a month during the fourth quarter

of 2021 due to lack of crude oil imports on account

of foreign exchange issues and escalating crude oil

prices that hampered timely procurement. In turn, a

decline in the production of petrol, auto diesel, and

furnace oil was observed during the year.

during the COVID-19 pandemic led to the

manufacturing of basic pharmaceutical

products and pharmaceutical preparations

subsector to continue its growth momentum

in 2021. Accordingly, the subsector registered an

expansion of 12.6 per cent during 2021, continuing

the expansion of 6.6 per cent registered in 2020.

The increase in the demand for Ayurvedic products,

predominantly driven by the pandemic, led to the

continuation of the upward growth momentum of

the subsector.

The manufacturing of rubber and plastic

products subsector recorded a significant

expansion during 2021. The COVID-19 induced

demand for medical rubber gloves alongside

significant improvements to the domestic

production capacity of tyres resulted in the

subsector registering a growth of 35.7 per cent.

The growth of the subsector was also driven by

the increased production of zippers, plastic bottles,

and elastomeric yarn, among others. In 2021,

production of tobacco products, which contracted

for three consecutive years, registered a growth

of 8.0 per cent in comparison to the contraction of

11.0 per cent witnessed in 2020.

The manufacture of leather and related

products subsector and the chemicals and

chemical products subsector also depicted

subdued performance. The manufacture of

leather and related products subsector recorded

a marginal expansion of 1.3 per cent in 2021,

while the manufacture of chemicals and chemical

products subsector registered an overall contraction

of 4.7 per cent. Key drivers of the decline of the

latter were the reduced production of chemical

fertilisers. However, both sectors showed signs of

improvement towards the end of the year with the

improvement in domestic demand conditions.

Other sub sectors of IIP, such as the

manufacture of wood products (except

furniture), electrical equipment, furniture, paper

and paper products, machinery and equipment,

and printing and reproduction of recorded

media registered expansions during 2021.

Increased production of corrugated papers, paper

bags, and exercise book production contributed

to the expansion in paper and paper products

subsector, while physical school reopening and

the resultant rebound in educational activities

resulted in the increased production of printed

books, which led to the positive performance of

the printing and reproduction of recorded media

subsector. The increase in production of several

household appliances, in line with growing demand

for domestic products, amid import restrictions, led

to the expansion of the manufacture of electrical

equipment sub sector.

Industrial Policies and Institutional Support

During the year, the Government continued

to undertake several initiatives aimed at

strengthening the industrial sector to enhance

the domestic production base. The completion

of the drafting of the National Policy for Industrial

Development (NaPID) marked a key milestone in

2021. The drafting of the NaPID was preceded by

an industry diagnosis report that served to provide a

comprehensive and indepth analysis, diagnosing the

factors that were hindering the progress of industrial

development. The NaPID strives to establish a

globally competitive industry for sustainable

and inclusive growth, while also focusing on the

advancement of green growth and digitalisation.

Meanwhile, initiatives were underway to establish

an industrial zone in Katunayake Kaludiyawela

and to expand the Kalutara industrial estate under

the Regional Industrial Estates Development

Programme. In line with the Government’s target

to expand the scope of mineral-based industries,

preliminary work was underway to commence

a Value Addition Project for Mineral Sands

excavated by Lanka Mineral Sands Limited, as a

Public Private Partnership (PPP). Meanwhile, the

Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) guidelines

for the automobile manufacturing, assembling,

and manufacturing of spare parts industry were

implemented during the year. At end 2021, 13

manufacturing companies were registered under

the SOP, while 2,361 vehicles were assembled.

Moreover, the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers

was granted to setup 5 techno parks in Galle,

Kurunegala, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, and Habarana

areas under the purview of the Ministry of Technology

with the aim of attracting foreign investments in the

form of new ventures with advanced technology,

which may improve the export base of the country

as well as create knowledge spillovers. During the

year, the MoF also initiated the establishment of a

virtual platform for Small and Medium Enterprises

(SMEs) with the support of the Asian Development

Bank (ADB) targeting the enhancement of technical

capacity of women entrepreneurs. With the view

of improving and sustaining a national innovation

ecosystem, the National Innovation Agency (NIA)

was established under the State Ministry of Skills

Development, Vocational Education, Research and

Innovation in November 2021. The NIA is expected

to facilitate collaborations between industry,

academia, and the Government to harness and

enable commercialisation of innovations across all

sectors in the economy. The State Ministry of Skills

Development, Vocational Education, Research and

Innovation undertook various measures to catering

the educational needs of the industrial sector.

During the year, the Nipunatha Sisu Saviya bursary

scheme was implemented to provide a monthly

stipend of Rs. 4,000 to vocational trainees of low

income families. Moreover, several infrastructure

development projects were in progress to modernise

technical colleges and improve vocational training

centers under the Tech Udana Programme.

The Board of Investment (BOI) and the

Export Development Board (EDB) engaged in

various development initiatives to facilitate

foreign and local investment for domestic

manufacturing industries. During the year, a

modern pharmaceutical manufacturing zone was

established in Arabokka, Hambantota aimed at

strengthening Sri Lanka’s pharmaceutical industry

to cater to both the domestic and international

market. Accordingly, this project is to be developed

in 2 phases, each of which will accommodate 20

companies in each stage. A textile manufacturing

zone was also established during the year, in

Eravur, to reduce material lead time and input

costs with the availability of locally sourced fabric.

The fabric park has already attracted investments

amounting to US dollars 35 million. Moreover, the

approval of the Cabinet of Ministers was granted

to develop a large scale tyre manufacturing plant

at the Hambantota International Port as a strategic

development project. The project is expected to

entail the use of local rubber resources for tyre

manufacturing and subsequent exporting. During

the year, the EDB completed the development of

the regulatory framework for the conduct of the

boat building industry. Further, export advisory

committees were appointed under the EDB Act

No. 40 of 1979 covering 24 key export sectors for

a period of five years. The advisory committees

are expected to create collaborations between

the public and private sector to identify market

challenges and opportunities, while undertaking

initiatives to strengthen competitiveness and outline

required policies. Moreover, in collaboration with

the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission

(TVEC), the EDB prepared a vocational education

training plan to identify the skill gaps and training

requirements of the Electrical and Electronics

industry in Sri Lanka. Further, the EDB coordinated

a series of webinars, buyer linkup gatherings,

and training programmes to encourage and build

the capacity of export oriented SMEs and that of

women entrepreneurs. The EDB also continued to

extend its support to export businesses affected by

the COVID-19 pandemic, through the development

of sectoral revival programmes, formalised help

desk, exporter forums, and e-marketplace to

facilitate potential trade activities.

The National Gem and Jewellery Authority

(NGJA) undertook various steps to enable

Sri Lanka to position itself as a leading gem

center in the region. Accordingly, during the

year, discussions were held with Madagascar,

Tanzania, and Nepal to import rough gems into

Sri Lanka for value addition. The NGJA also

successfully implemented a One-Stop-Shop to

simplify the process of obtaining various licenses

and approvals for unutilised underground gem

resources. It also undertook measures to ease

gem mining restrictions and associated charges to

promote the sale of gems and jewellery. Further,

a 14 per cent tax imposed on the profits earned

by gem and jewellery industrialists were waived

off in April 2021 to encourage manufacturing,

while increasing the value threshold of gems that

could be sold through virtual platforms. Moreover,

construction work related to the international gem

tower in Ratnapura was underway during the year.

Other government authorities continued

to provide institutional support to industrial

sector and policy formulation. The National

Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA)

continued its endeavours to popularise the Made in

Sri Lanka logo through several trade fairs in 2021.

During the year, 37 SMEs were authorised to use

the logo in recognition of their products entailing

high value additions and with the view to promote

and uplift such products to be marketed at a global

level. Further, the Made in Sri Lanka Business to

Business (B2B) online trade portal was launched

in December 2021 to expand the marketing

opportunities available to SMEs. By the end of the

year, 346 sellers had registered with this portal.

The Regional Entrepreneurship Development

Programme and the Upadidari Vyavasayaka

Udanaya Programme were continued in 2021,

promoting entrepreneurships and forming pathways

for university graduates to develop as successful

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

78

entrepreneurs. Accordingly, 5,179 regional level

entrepreneurs were trained, and 71 university

graduates were provided with grants through these

programmes. In the meanwhile, the Industrial

Development Board (IDB) established a Smart One

Stop facilitation center for the Hambantota area

to facilitate initiatives in the area, while promoting

industrial development in the Southern province.

During the year, the IDB also commenced the

Dayata Punarudayak - Karmanthayata Jeewayak

Programme to empower and support small

scale entrepreneurs. The National Productivity

Secretariat (NPS) continued to conduct district level

and institutional level productivity improvement

programmes aimed at creating a people-centric

economy through the empowerment of SMEs.

Several institutions continued to facilitate

technology driven initiatives with the aim

of elevating technological innovation which

has been identified as essential to a dynamic

industrial sector. Accordingly, the National Institute

of Fundamental Studies initiated the preparation of a

technology transfer policy to facilitate the application

of technology and research in the industrial sector.

Moreover, during the year, virtual training and

education sessions pertaining to patent awareness,

technology transfer and commercialisation were

organised by the Coordinating Secretariat for

Science, Technology and Innovation (COSTI) in

collaboration with the World Intellectual Property

Organisation. Further, the National Engineering

Research and Development Center of Sri Lanka

together with the State Ministry of Rattan, Brass,

Pottery, Furniture and Rural Industrial Promotion

conducted several virtual technology dissemination

seminars to facilitate development of SMEs amid

the pandemic. Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Institute of

Nanotechnology (SLINTEC) continued its

technology transfer and commercialisation

initiatives pertaining to emerging fields of studies,

including value addition to local graphite, post-

harvest technology, nano-fertiliser, and novel

healthcare innovations against COVID-19. The

National Science Foundation (NSF) facilitated

the development of the domestic manufacturing

sector through the provision of 11 new research

and development grants to multiple sectors

including health, agriculture, engineering,

and education. During the year, the Industrial

Technology Institute (ITI) commenced testing

services pertaining to several novel laboratories

including pharmaceutical laboratory, lubricant and

petroleum oil testing laboratory, and packaging

testing laboratory. The ITI also entered into 10

Memorandum of Understandings (MoUs) during

the period with various ministries, industries,

international universities, and other authorities to

establish technological partnerships and facilitate

collaborative academic and research activities.

The Industrial Chambers continued to

provide training and promotional assistance

to enhance the competitiveness of Sri Lankan

industries. During the year, the National

Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (NCCSL)

conducted several training and knowledge sharing

programmes aimed at facilitating importers and

exporters to overcome contemporary issues and

challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic,

while business development programmes were also

conducted at international levels including virtual

B2B sessions and business forums to create

trading opportunities for Sri Lankan exporters.

Further, the NCCSL entered into several MoUs with

regional and international institutions during 2021,

thereby establishing networks with counterpart

organisations. The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce

(CCC), in collaboration with an international

partner, implemented the Exporter Barometer

Survey in late 2021. The survey is to be conducted

bi-annually to obtain exporter insights. Further,

2

79

facilitating trade and business promotion, the CCC

conducted a series of international webinars, B2B

sessions, and meetings with both local and foreign

diplomats. Moreover, with a view to enhancing

institutional cooperation across industrial sectors,

the CCC entered into MoUs with 6 international

level chambers during the year. Meanwhile, the Sri

Lanka Chamber of Small and Medium Industries

conducted capacity building and motivational

programmes to support the SME sector.

Several loan schemes were introduced

in line with the National Policy Framework

to ensure that SMEs were provided with the

necessary financial support in 2021. The Kiri

Shakthi loan scheme was implemented during the

year providing loans amounting up to Rs. 1 million

each at a concessionary interest rate of 7.5 per

cent per annum, with the target of strengthening of

small and medium size dairy farmers. Accordingly,

739 loans were granted under this credit scheme,

thereby leading to the disbursement of Rs. 400.4

million in 2021. Further, as per the decision of the

Cabinet of Ministers to provide financial support to

the manufacturers of organic fertiliser, pesticides

and herbicides, a special loan scheme was

introduced. Meanwhile, guidelines and instructions

were issued by the Central Bank to financial

institutions on implementing debt moratorium and

working capital loan facilities to revive SMEs, self-

employed, and individuals affected by the COVID-19

pandemic. During the year, the MOF also expedited

the establishment of the National Credit Guarantee

Scheme to strengthen the SME sector. Moreover,

the Rooftop Solar Power Generation Line of Credit

and the Small and Medium Enterprise Line of

Credit schemes were continued with the financial

support of a donor agency. By the end of 2021,

Rs. 23.4 billion had been granted under these two

credit schemes.

Construction, and Mining and Quarrying

Bolstered by the renewed demand for real

estate and housing, and the resumption of

projects, construction value-added picked up

by 1.9 per cent in 2021, recovering from the

contraction of 13.2 per cent recorded in 2020,

yet the raw material shortage hindered the

full recovery. Considering construction-related

indicators, total cement availability in the country

recorded a marginal decline, while building

material imports recorded an increase during

2021. Meanwhile, credit to the private sector

granted by Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) for

construction activities, including personal housing

construction activities, also recorded a growth as

of end December 2021, denoting an increased

availability of funds for construction activities.

However, the third wave of the pandemic, which

spanned during the second and third quarters of

the year and disruptions to global and local supply

chains affected adversely to the construction-

related activities. The business surveys related to

construction activities conducted by the Central

Bank indicated that supply-side disturbances,

especially the short supply of key raw materials

such as cement, steel and tiles, as well as the

rapid price increases hindered the full potential

of the industry. Meanwhile, mining and quarrying

activities which mainly consist of mining activities

that provide inputs to the construction activities

such as sand mining, recorded a growth of 2.8 per

cent in 2021, largely benefitting from the recovery

in construction activities, compared to 12.5 per

cent contraction recorded in 2020. With regard

to the other mining-related indicators, phosphate

production recorded an increase in 2021, indicating

a favourable performance in mining activities.

Considering the gem mining related indicators,

gem export volumes recorded an increase in 2021.

Electricity, Water and Waste Treatment

Mainly driven by electricity and gas

supply-related activities, the value-added of

electricity, water and waste treatment activities

rebounded by 3.9 per cent in 2021, compared

to 0.8 per cent contraction recorded in 2020.

The largest contributor to the improvement in

this category, electricity, gas, steam and air

conditioning supply activities grew by 6.1 per cent

during the year compared to the contraction of 1.6

per cent recorded in 2020. Considering electricity

generation data, the total electricity generation

increased significantly in 2021, mainly due to higher

demand from the industry sector with the recovery

in the economy. Among the other sub-economic

activities within the category, water collection,

treatment, and supply activities grew by 4.3 per

cent during the year compared to 4.8 per cent

growth in 2020. However, sewerage, waste

treatment, and disposal activities declined by

3.3 per cent in 2021 on top of the 1.0 per cent

decline recorded in 2020.

Services

With the rebuilding of economic interaction

and pick-up in household consumption, the

value-added of Services activities climbed up

by 3.0 per cent in 2021, from the 1.6 per cent

downturn in 2020. The recovery was upheld by

the expansion in financial services while wholesale

and retail trade activities and real estate activities

also expanded during the year, benefitting

from the relaxed pandemic-related restrictions.

Further, supplemented by the pandemic-induced

demand, IT programming, telecommunication and

health activities also expanded during the period.

Moreover, the recovery in other personal service

activities, professional services, insurance and

transportation services, together with the growth in

public administration, education services and postal

and courier services also contributed positively

to the overall growth. Moreover, accommodation,

food and beverage service activities rebounded

during the year, recording a moderate growth after

two consecutive years of contraction. Mirroring

the services performance, the PMI for Services

activities, compiled monthly by the Central Bank,

indicated an overall expansion. Moreover, the

Demand and Sales sub-indices of the BOS related

to Services activities denoted an increase on

average during the year, indicating the pickup in

Services activities.

Wholesale and Retail Trade

Wholesale and retail trade activities

recorded a moderate growth of 2.0 per cent in

value-added terms in 2021, compared to 1.4 per

cent growth recorded in 2020, induced by the

policy stimuli and relaxed mobility restrictions.

The trade activities were sustained by the gradual

adoption of the country to conduct operations

under the 'new normal'. Further, the Government

also provided periodic liquidity support by way of

financial assistance, buoying the disposable income

of consumers. The total imports volume index

recorded an increase during the year, mainly due

to imports of investment and intermediate goods,

while the volume of consumer goods imported

recorded only a marginal decline. Moreover, loans

and advances to the private sector provided by

Licensed Commercial Banks for wholesale and

retail trade activities increased substantially at the

end of 2021, compared to end 2020.

Transportation and Storage

With the intermittent imposition of mobility

restrictions, the value-added of transportation

activities recovered marginally by 0.6 per cent,

compared to 6.8 per cent decline recorded in

2020. Transportation activities that were adversely

affected from the onset of the pandemic indicated

an improvement during early 2021, yet was later

dampened by the emergence of the third wave of the

pandemic. However, the easing of mobility restrictions

from the beginning of the fourth quarter benefitted the

revival of the transportation activities. Even though

passenger conveyance was adversely affected due

to the lower usage and the limited availability of public

transportation during the pandemic-hit periods, the

goods transportation, as an essential service, was

broadly uninterrupted during 2021 compared to the

previous year. The operations in seaports stepped

up during the year despite the abating of global

supply chains. Accordingly, an increase in container

handling (in terms of Twenty-Foot Equivalent

Units) and cargo handling was observed during

the year. Further, the freight kilometers flown by Sri

Lankan Airlines also increased in 2021. However,

the passenger kilometers operated by the Sri

Lanka Transport Board, private bus operators and

Sri Lankan Airlines continued to contract during 2021.

Accommodation and Food Service Activities

The gradual rebound in tourist arrivals and

staycations provided impetus to the value-

added of accommodation, food and beverage

service activities to recover by 1.9 per cent in

2021, compared to 39.4 per cent contraction

recorded in 2020. Tourism-related activities were

hit hard by the pandemic due to the imposition of

international and domestic travel restrictions. The

country gradually lifted inbound travel restrictions

by introducing bio-bubbles for international

tourists along with attractive tour packages,

resulting in a strong month-on-month growth in

tourist arrivals towards the latter part of the year.

Further, domestic tourism activities rebounded

during the year as many hotels offered exclusive

discounts for local travellers. Nevertheless, the

recovery of accommodation, food, and beverage

service activities was largely hindered by the third

wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Financial, Insurance and Real Estate Activities including Ownership of Dwellings

Continued increase in financial services

steered the value-added of financial, insurance,

and real estate activities including ownership

of dwellings which grew by 5.6 per cent in 2021,

compared to 4.7 per cent growth recorded in

2020. Accordingly, financial services activities and

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

82

auxiliary financial services expanded by 7.5 per

cent, compared to 10.9 per cent growth in 2020.

Reflecting the continuous expansion in financial

services, the loan book of banks and non-bank

financial institutions increased substantially during

the year while the deposit base also expanded,

despite the challenging environment. Further, as

pointed out in the Credit Supply Survey conducted

by the Central Bank on a quarterly basis, the

demand for credit was at elevated levels due

to the low-interest rate environment while the

willingness to lend was also at healthy levels due

to the surplus liquidity that prevailed for most part

of the year. Meanwhile, insurance, reinsurance,

and pension funding activities recovered by 5.1

per cent in 2021, compared to the contraction of

3.3 per cent recorded in 2020 while the real estate

activities, including ownership of dwellings, grew

by 3.1 per cent in 2021, recovering from 1.2 per

cent contraction experienced in 2020.

Information and Communication

Benefiting from the opportunities opened-

up from the pandemic, the value-added of

telecommunication, and IT programming and

consultancy services continued the momentum

in 2021 growing at a healthy rate of 17.5 per

cent on top of 14.1 per cent growth achieved

in 2020. The telecommunications industry played a

key role in maintaining socio-economic interaction

during the pandemic. Accordingly, the sector

substantially benefitted from the pandemic-induced

extra demand for voice and data with the increased

reliance on work-from-home arrangements,

online education and entertainment. Accordingly,

telecommunication activities grew significantly by

16.2 per cent during the year, compared to 15.4

per cent growth in 2020. The industry responded

strongly to high demand, by extending the coverage

and capacity levels, improving the service quality,

and introducing special packages catering to needs

such as working-from-home and learning-from-

home arrangements. Meanwhile, IT programming

consultancy and related activities also grew

significantly by 21.7 per cent in 2021, compared to

10.0 per cent growth in 2020, underpinned by the

surge in demand for technology-based solutions

such as digital media, networking, cyber security,

cloud computing services, artificial intelligence and

automation.

Other Services Activities

Most of the other service-related economic

activities which dulled in 2020 due to the

adverse impacts of the first two waves of

the COVID-19 pandemic managed to recover

in 2021 despite the disturbances from the

recurrent waves. Accordingly, other personal

services activities consisting of personal services

such as arts, entertainment and recreation, laundry

services, hairdressing and other beauty treatment,

and funeral and related activities, which contracted

by 6.5 per cent in 2020, grew by 1.1 per cent in 2021,

due to the comparatively favourable environment.

Further, professional services activities also grew

by 1.4 per cent in 2021, recovering from the

2.7 per cent contraction recorded in 2020.

Moreover, public administration and defense

activities grew by 1.9 per cent in 2021, compared

to the 1.6 per cent growth observed in 2020 while

human health activities which remained active

during the pandemic grew by 5.7 per cent in 2021

on top of 4.3 per cent growth recorded in 2020.

Further, education, postal and courier services,

and programming and broadcasting activities also

contributed positively to overall economic growth

during the year.

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE, INCOME AND EMPLOYMENT

Introduction

Micro, Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (MSMEs) remain the core and account for the vast majority of enterprises, while providing a significant source of employment, yielding a greater proportion of output in most countries around the world. They account for about two thirds of employment and contribute to more than 50 per cent of GDP in many countries.1 Contribution of the MSME sector to the economic output is generally found to be higher in high income countries than in medium and low income countries, highlighting the potential of their contribution to growth, particularly in developing nations (Gonzales, Hommes and Laura, 2014).

Generally, MSMEs span across all forms of social clusters, including rural and low income areas, with a large share of such firms being informal establishments. It is also reported that there are about 365-445 million MSMEs in emerging economies, while over three-fourths of such establishments are found to be informal enterprises (International Labour Organization, 2016). MSMEs appear to heavily contribute to increasing the income levels of low income families, and thereby contribute to reducing disparities in the income distribution. Further, as a result of their small size and customer centric business models, small businesses are also more flexible and better able to withstand changes in the economic landscape by adapting to the changing environment and new advancements in technology. Therefore, MSMEs can improve the resilience of an economy up to a certain extent and pave the way for growth and development.

BOX 4Catalysing Micro, Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (MSMEs) as a Growth Driver and Challenges

MSMEs as a Growth Driver

A considerable body of literature provides statistical evidence to prove a positive relationship between the existence of MSMEs and the overall economic growth of a country. Successful MSMEs usually evolve into large organisations, and such organisations contribute to economic growth immensely. MSMEs make an important contribution to the economy as a breeding ground for large firms, an employment provider, and a facilitator of innovation, thereby leading to inclusive and balanced growth.

A breeding ground for large organisations: Most successful economies comprise a healthy mix of both large and small firms. Large firms typically are more productive, have the capacity to invest in capital intensive projects, facilitate research and development on a larger scale, and in turn facilitate the creation of new knowledge contributing to yield growth episodes. On the other hand, MSMEs play an important role by acting as a breeding ground for such large organisations, which in turn would promote the businesses of MSMEs by expanding supply chains. Most modern global business giants, such as Samsung, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook initiated their operations as small businesses and developed gradually into their current status, thus highlighting the potential of such small businesses to transform into any scale, and ultimately drive respective national and regional economies. In fact, a healthy MSME sector can contribute to improving entrepreneurship skills among the general population of a country, in turn augmenting human capital, which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth.

MSMEs increase employment and overall output in an economy: MSMEs, being the largest segment involving a significantly large number of enterprises, provide employment opportunities for the majority of the population. This in turn help in increasing the spending power of the general public, which drives up consumption and boosts overall economic growth. As MSMEs span across multiple sectors of the economy, empowering a large number of people in terms of livelihood and contributing to reducing inequality, these establishments play an important role in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), thereby supporting respective economies to record sustainable growth episodes. Further, as achievements of SDGs generally cast a positive image on countries, a healthy MSME sector can play an indirect role to support economies by improving investor sentiments as well.

MSMEs increase competition among firms: MSMEs can increase competition in their respective business environments by identifying niche business propositions. Under an enabling environment, increased levels of competition created by MSMEs can encourage innovative ideas, which is an essential element of sustained growth

1 Based on data from the MSME Economic Indicators Database 2019, available at SME Finance Forum (https://www.smefinanceforum.org), which contains secondary data of registered MSMEs in 176 countries. Information for the latest available year is considered, which may not necessarily be the same for all countries. Due to differences in source institutions and time, data are not standardised, thereby somewhat limiting country comparability. Based on availability, the numbers of data points used to arrive at median values are 80 for employment share and 38 for value added share.

paths. Recent successes of fresh ideas such as Uber and Lyft for ridesharing and Airbnb for homestay facilities, and the multitude of similar adaptations provide evidence for the innovative capacity of MSMEs and how they can enrich the lives of numerous stakeholders, who are not usually parts of large traditional organisations.

Importance of MSMEs in Developing and Emerging Economies

The contribution of MSMEs to the development process is particularly important for emerging and developing economies as they play an effective role in alleviating poverty by facilitating sustainable development and innovation. As per the estimates of the World Bank, about 600 million jobs will be needed by 2030 in order to accommodate the growing population. Given typically high levels of population growth in developing countries, the role of MSMEs as an employment provider becomes extremely vital. In this regard, MSMEs are more important than large organisations, as MSMEs are generally more labour intensive and have the potential to absorb large labour forces in developing and emerging countries. Further, developing countries can utilise MSMEs to address issues such as improving female labour force participation, effective use of underutilised natural resources, and diversifying economic activities across various sectors. At the same time, the innovative capacity of MSMEs, given enabling conditions, could assist developing and emerging economies to avoid growth stagnation, enabling them to elevate into higher income countries. It is noted that the growth prospects of Asian economies, such as Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, India etc., are driven by small businesses which are innovative, highlighting the importance of policy support to facilitate innovative activities in MSMEs (Asian Productivity Organization, 2015).

Challenges Faced by MSMEs

Although certain characteristics, for example, the small size of MSMEs, can be advantageous in some areas, the nature of MSMEs can sometimes become an issue, leading to substantial challenges, such as those discussed below, ultimately leading to low productivity of MSMEs in comparison to large firms.

Limited access to finance: Difficulties in access to finance is one of the key obstacles faced by MSMEs across many countries. As proved in studies, such limited access to finance remains the main hindrance to the growth of MSMEs. As a result, undertaking capital intensive projects is difficult for most of these establishments. Reasons highlighted in the literature for difficulties of MSMEs in obtaining services of formal financial institutions include, among others, information asymmetry, limited availability and low quality of collateral, low financial literacy of MSMEs, high delinquency rates, and limited expertise of lenders themselves in assessing MSME ventures. As a result of these limitations, attracting financing via banks, especially for project financing, becomes particularly difficult without collateral.

Limited business skills and inability to retain human resources: Lack of expertise in fields such as finance, accounting, taxation, human resource management and marketing which are integral elements for the success of any business endeavour, also remains a key issue observed in MSMEs. Moreover, by nature, MSMEs lack the buffers to absorb large losses, thus they are highly vulnerable to business cycles and shocks emanating from domestic and international fronts. Inability to retain key employees is also perceived as a concern hindering the progress of MSMEs. In many instances, job opportunities provided by MSMEs tend to be temporary, driving employees to constantly search for other opportunities. At the same time, MSMEs often cannot compete on pay and benefits offered by large organisations, especially for skilled workers, thus resulting in higher worker turnover and the inability to retain such skilled workers, who are capable of driving the development of small businesses. As a result, many such businesses tend to be managed and run by the owners themselves, which in turn can result in management, governance, finance and sustainability issues, even for successful ventures.

Regulatory barriers and incoherent policy: MSMEs also face difficulties due to regulatory barriers in many countries, across various aspects such as business registration, quality and environmental standards, reporting requirements, taxation etc. However, depending on the country, these difficulties and their impact can vary significantly. For example, even though regulatory barriers have seen a large reduction in OECD countries over the last decade or so, the complexity of such barriers remains diverse across countries (OECD, 2018). Small businesses typically do not have the capacity to effectively study regulatory complexities due to the low availability of skills and funding. As a result, overall limitations in the doing-business environment could lead to multiple difficulties for MSMEs, which may especially be the case with developing countries, as they operate with relatively weak institutional infrastructure. Further, lack of policy consistency and less transparency also adds to these regulatory barriers faced by MSMEs.

Low market share and limited access to markets: MSMEs also face challenges in maintaining revenue streams and suffer from low sales in general, mainly due to low market share and weak accessibility of markets. This can be contributed by various reasons such as, among others, inability to spend on large advertising budgets, limited networking channels, limited use of social media and limited online presence, and weaknesses in adopting new technology leading to comparatively lower market access.

Lack of information and data on MSMEs: Information on MSMEs is typically difficult to obtain in many countries, particularly in developing economies. Unlike large organisations, which typically have to publish information, particularly in relation to financial data, MSMEs usually do not have such requirements and hence information is usually held private, forcing lenders to incur costs to obtain reliable information, and in turn discouraging them to lend to MSMEs (Yoshino

Guarantee Corporation Malaysia Berhad in Malaysia, etc.), establishing development banks specialising in lending to high risk projects with non- or less-profit oriented motives (for example, China Development Bank in China, Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW Bankengruppe) in Germany, Korea Development Bank in Korea, etc.), implementing policy measures such as imposing lending targets to drive lending by formal financial institutions to small businesses, donor financing via multinational agencies, improving access to alternative channels of financing, such as crowd funding and angel investors, and measures to reduce information asymmetries, such as developing MSME databases with information required by lenders (for example, the Credit Risk Database of Japan, which aims at enhancing the efficiency of credit supply to MSMEs with financial information of a large number of small businesses).

Supporting winners: In addition to addressing concerns regarding financial difficulties of MSMEs, several other programmes are used worldwide to provide overall assistance to establishments in the sector. For example, some countries such as Korea have used a ‘picking winners approach’, where assistance is targeted to industries and businesses with growth potential and organisational capacity in line with national priorities. However, there are criticisms against such a policy as well, since it could lead to suboptimal resource allocation. Nevertheless, it is a policy that could be used to guide resources to intended sectors, especially during times when market driven allocations do not reach areas of growth potential.

Clustering and improving linkages: Global market liberalisation and globalisation could lead MSMEs to a disadvantageous position due to capacity mismatch against international players. In this regard, creating clusters of businesses and linking MSMEs with the value chains of large organisations, such as the Industrial Linkage Programme of Malaysia, could assist MSMEs to compete in international markets. Moreover, subcontracting linkages between large enterprises and MSMEs can enhance the productivity of the industry, while providing benefits to MSMEs in terms of easier acquisition of new technologies, management methods, marketing and input materials, and production techniques (Wijesinha, 2011).

Targeted support: National prioritisation programmes, such as the SME Promotion Plan in Thailand, whereby the economic contribution of MSMEs is expected to be enhanced (OECD/ERIA, 2018), can also streamline the efforts to support MSMEs in a country. Low use of information technology by MSMEs is often cited as a key area that needs to be improved. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, even businesses which did not have any virtual presence started to embrace online tools to reach customers and suppliers. However, MSMEs stand to gain much more by embracing information technology products and services into their businesses. In this regard, governments and support groups can play a vital role by improving the

and Taghizadeh-Hesary, 2016). This is a hindrance to the development of MSMEs, as it does not only prevent financial institutions’ ability to evaluate these businesses, but also limits availability, quality and timeliness of research on the MSME sector.

Impact of the pandemic and other developments: MSMEs across the world endured difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic, which created large losses in revenue and increased uncertainty. Although the unprecedented levels of policy support by governments and other authorities may have helped these businesses to weather this difficult period, many of them have not recovered fully. The uncertainty in the global political landscape due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict may also create difficulties for MSMEs, particularly for those who are linked with value chains, exports and services trades such as tourism.

Gender-wise disparities: The participation of women entrepreneurs in MSMEs is found to vary across countries. Studies report about one third of formal small businesses are owned by women, although this share ranges from a high of more than 40 per cent in East Asia and the Pacific to a low of below 10 per cent in South Asia (IFC, 2014). In addition to common challenges faced by small businesses, women owned MSMEs face additional hindrances, depending on cultural biases, and relatively low levels of size and networks. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is also found to be disproportionate on women-owned MSMEs, where a larger proportion of women-owned businesses than men-owned businesses are found to be affected by the pandemic and are likely not to survive (United Nations, 2021). However, there exists evidence to suggest that women-owned MSMEs are performing well, although often overlooked by financial institutions (IFC, 2014). Women entrepreneurs are better at achieving development goals, as women are found to reinvest more in families and communities (International Trade Centre, 2014), thus highlighting the importance of continuous commitment to address these gender-wise disparities to achieve inclusive growth.

Successful Strategies to Promote the MSME Sector

A variety of strategies have been used by different countries to address common problems faced by MSMEs.

Addressing financing difficulties: As many MSMEs find it difficult to access finance from formal channels, strategies to minimise this limitation can often contribute to the growth of MSMEs. Moreover, many other challenges faced by small businesses are also linked to low capacity, often as a result of funding difficulties. In this regard, some of the successful strategies undertaken by various countries include introducing credit guarantee schemes that address limitations of collateral based lending by financial institutions (for example, the multitude of credit guarantee corporations in Japan, the Korea Credit Guarantee Fund and the Korea Technology Finance Corporation in Korea, the Credit

awareness on the advantages of utilising information technology, by way of programmes such as the Digital MSME Scheme in India, which aims to enhance the adoption of information technology by MSMEs.2 Multilateral donor agencies also support capacity development of MSMEs, thereby contributing to improve business skills of these entrepreneurs. Further, given the commitment of most governments over the world, and the community drive to address climate change, businesses engaged in ‘Green Activities’ and those who promote sustainable business practices can also obtain financial support from various public, private and multinational agencies, while they can enjoy improved market presence as well.

Overall, measures that facilitate sustainable growth, which allow countries to avoid growth stagnation, pave way for the development of the MSME sector as well. For example, efforts to create a knowledge based economy with an emphasis on developing new knowledge is considered a main success factor of the Korean economy and its MSME sector (Gregory et al., 2002). Similarly, improvements to the education system with a focus on improving skills relevant to businesses via vocational training, which has been reported as a key driver of the success of German MSMEs (Herr and Nettekoven, 2018) can contribute to creating small businesses empowered with skills needed to compete in the modern globalised marketplace.

MSMEs in Sri Lanka3

MSMEs play a major role in the development process in Sri Lanka by providing employment to a large proportion of the population. Nevertheless, many of the common hurdles to their development discussed above are faced by Sri Lankan MSMEs as well. Despite their importance to the economic output of the country, which is reported in excess of 50 per cent,4 most Sri Lankan MSMEs may not have reached their true potential due to capacity limitations (often linked with limited access to finance), low adoption of technology and limited linkages to value chains, both domestic and global. Driven by low financial literacy and difficulties in accessing the formal financial system due to a variety of reasons, many small businesses in Sri Lanka end up utilising the services of unregistered money lenders, who are widely spread across the country, providing financial services at extremely high interest rates. Subsequently, many such entrepreneurs face difficulties in meeting high interest costs, thereby threatening the viability of their business ventures. The informal nature of such lending services makes it hard to track such activities, thereby limiting the ability to take effective regulatory actions as well. Meanwhile, like in other countries, lack of information has also been a serious limitation to making a meaningful assessment of MSMEs in Sri Lanka, while also making it difficult to

assess the impact of informal market lenders, in order to properly evaluate whether their role is a facilitative or an exploitative one. There have been efforts to support these businesses by both governmental and non-governmental bodies at different points in time. For example, the National Policy Framework for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) Development of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (2016) comprise detailed action plans for the development of the MSME sector. However, the implementation and coordination of such policies remain weak, requiring further improvements in the implementation process. The Central Bank also plays an important facilitating role in supporting small businesses under its agency function of regional development. Accordingly, both financial and non-financial support is provided, together with participatory financial institutions and a number of other resource providers. Meanwhile, the large policy support extended to MSMEs during the pandemic could have helped the sector to stay afloat during this difficult period. However, in general, MSMEs in Sri Lanka are yet to exploit new normal opportunities created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, the prevailing uncertainty of the global and domestic economic activity can be harmful to MSMEs, which require remedial and preventive policies. Going forward, timely measures are required for the implementation of ‘enablers’, including the expeditious operationalisation of the proposed credit guarantee institution and the establishment of a dedicated development bank, in order to extend the required sustained support for MSMEs to prevail and prosper through challenging times. Overall, policy initiatives need to be coordinated with a national drive to embrace MSMEs, which are often neglected, in order to bring them into the mainstream business environment.

2.5 Expenditure

Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE), which

consists of consumption and investment

expenditure of the economy, grew by a higher

rate of 13.1 per cent in 2021 at current prices,

compared to the marginal growth of 0.5 per

cent in 2020, supported by the expansion in

both consumption and investment expenditure.

The accommodative monetary policy stance,

as well as fiscal policy stimuli, bolstered the

final consumption expenditure. Accordingly,

consumption expenditure increased significantly by

9.9 per cent in 2021, being the major contributor of

GDE while investment expenditure also rebounded

by recording a significant growth of 23.2 per cent

during the year. On the external front, net external

demand at current prices contracted significantly by

31.6 per cent in 2021, compared to the contraction

of 5.1 per cent recorded in 2020. This was due

to the growth of 25.7 per cent in import of goods

and services, which outpaced the 23.3 per cent

growth recorded in export of goods and services,

partly owing to high import prices prevailed during

the period. Accordingly, GDP at current prices,

which is the aggregate of GDE and the net external

demand, recorded a growth of 11.9 per cent in

2021, compared to the marginal growth of 0.2 per

cent in 2020. Considering the estimates at constant

prices, consumption and investment expenditure

grew by 3.5 per cent and 3.0 per cent, respectively,

in 2021. Consequently, GDE recorded a moderate

growth of 3.4 per cent in 2021, compared to

the contraction of 4.6 per cent in 2020. In the

meantime, net external demand at constant (2010)

prices recorded only a marginal contraction of 0.4

per cent in 2021, benefitting from the higher growth

in the volume of exports. Consequently, GDP at

constant (2010) prices grew by 3.7 per cent in 2021

compared to the contraction of 3.6 per cent in 2020.

Consumption

Consumption expenditure, which is the

largest expenditure category accounting for

74.3 per cent of the aggregate expenditure of the

economy at current prices, grew at a favourable

rate of 9.9 per cent during the year, compared to

the moderate growth of 2.0 per cent recorded in

2020, induced by the rebound in consumption

demand with expanded space for consumer

spending. The growth in consumption expenditure

was mainly attributable to the considerable growth

in the main consumption expenditure category,

private consumption expenditure (PCE), which

accounted for 88.0 per cent of the total consumption

expenditure. The higher nominal consumption

expenditure reflected the impact of elevated prices

of most consumer goods categories, particularly

during the latter part of the year. In the meantime,

the government consumption expenditure (GCE)

grew at a moderate pace in 2021, compared to the

previous year.

Private Consumption Expenditure (PCE) at

current prices recorded a significant growth of

10.8 per cent in 2021, compared to the marginal

growth of 1.0 per cent in 2020, as consumers

were keen to spend following the opening

up of the economy. The gradual easing of

pandemic-related restrictions coupled with fiscal

as well as monetary policy stimuli encouraged

returning consumers to the markets. This

supported the growths in PCE categories such

as transport, restaurants and hotels, and clothing

and footwear. Further, the PCE categories, which

include essential goods and services such as PCE

on food and non-alcoholic beverages, housing,

water, electricity, gas and other fuels, health and

communication also expanded during the year.

GCE at current prices, which comprises

the collective final consumption expenditure

and individual final consumption expenditure

of the government, grew by 3.7 per cent in

2021, compared to the growth of 9.9 per cent

in 2020. Individual consumption expenditure

of the government, which particularly includes

government’s spending on health and education,

expanded moderately by 1.0 per cent in 2021,

on top of the higher growth of 17.8 per cent

reported in 2020. Further, collective consumption

expenditure such as defence, public services and

social protection, which comprises the general

government's expenditure on services that benefit

the community as a whole, grew by 5.3 per cent

in 2021, compared to the growth of 5.8 per cent in

2020. The government’s continued involvement in

curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic also contributed

to the expansion in GCE.

Investment

Benefitting from the gradual rebound

in economic activities and targeted policy

stimuli to shore up recovery, the investment

expenditure at current market prices grew

by 23.2 per cent in 2021, recovering from

the contraction of 4.2 per cent recorded in

2020. This recovery was largely driven by the

considerable growth in gross fixed capital

formation by 14.5 per cent in 2021, compared

to the contraction of 6.0 per cent in the previous

year. Accordingly, the major asset categories

of gross fixed capital formation, such as

construction, transport equipment, and machinery

and equipment, expanded in 2021, recovering

from the setback in 2020. Further, investment

expenditure on categories such as Information and

Communication Technology (ICT) equipment and

intellectual property products, as well as, changes

in inventories and acquisitions less disposals of

valuables recorded a considerable increase in 2021.

Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs), including

loans received by BOI companies during the

year, increased by 13.6 per cent to US dollars

780.2 million5 in 2021, compared to US dollars

687.0 million recorded in 2020. A recovery in

FDI inflows were recorded in the major sectors

including manufacturing sector, services sector,

and infrastructure projects, while FDI inflows to

the agriculture sector continued to remain low in

2021. Further, the total value of projects approved

during the year by the BOI under Sections 16 and

17 of the BOI Act No. 4 of 1978, is estimated at Rs.

517.4 billion, registering an expansion of 22.1 per

cent compared to 2020. The estimated investment

value of projects that commenced commercial

operations under Sections 16 and 17 of the BOI

Act amounted to Rs. 1,672.3 billion and Rs. 36.7

billion, respectively, recording an overall expansion

of 8.1 per cent in 2021 compared to the previous

year.

5 This includes receipts, including loans, to companies registered with the BOI and differs from the estimates presented in Chapter 5, mainly due to the inclusion of FDIs to non-BOI companies in the latter. Accordingly, total FDIs amounted to US dollars 784 millions in 2021.

Availability and Utilisation of Resources

The available resources of the economy

expanded in 2021 by 14.4 per cent at current

market prices in comparison to the contraction

of 5.0 per cent recorded in 2020. In this regard,

GDP which represents domestic resources, and

imports which are external resources expanded

in 2021, compared to the previous year, both in

current and constant prices. Considering the

utilisation of available resources, the majority of

resources was utilised for consumption purposes,

which accounted for 63.7 per cent of the total

resource utilisation in 2021. Meanwhile, at current

prices, the share of resources utilised for export

and investment purposes increased during the

year. At constant prices, the share of resources

utilised for export purposes increased while that

for investment purposes decreased.

Savings

Both domestic and national savings of the economy at current prices rebounded in 2021. Accordingly, domestic savings grew by 20.3 per cent in 2021 largely driven by the increase in private savings during the year. Meanwhile, an upsurge was reported in government dis-savings, mainly due to the lower government revenue. Consequently, domestic savings as a percentage of GDP increased to 20.1 per cent in 2021. In the meantime, in rupee terms, net primary income recorded an improvement, while net current transfers from the rest of the world contracted in 2021. As a combined outcome of these developments, national savings grew by 13.2 per cent to 23.8 per cent of GDP in 2021. Further, the national savings-investment gap

widened to 3.9 per cent of GDP in 2021, from 1.6

per cent of GDP in 2020, due to the significant

growth in investment expenditure.

2.6 Income

Gross Operating Surplus (GOS) continued to

be the largest income component of the economy

in 2021, followed by Compensation of Employees

(CE) and taxes less subsidies on production.

GOS grew by 13.6 per cent at current prices in

2021, accounting for 64.4 per cent of GDP. This

growth was mainly attributable to the expansion

in Net Operating Surplus (NOS) during the year.

When considering other major sources of income,

both CE as well as taxes less subsidies on

production expanded during the year. Meanwhile,

HH and NPISH sector continued to be the largest

contributor to the income within the institutional

sector classification, followed by NFC, GG, and FC.

2.7 Population, Labour Force and Employment

Population

The mid-year population in Sri Lanka was

estimated at 22.156 million in 2021 as per the

mid-year population estimates compiled by the

Registrar General’s Department. Accordingly,

the population growth rate increased considerably

to 1.1 per cent in 2021 from 0.5 per cent recorded

in 2020. The Western province was the largest

contributor towards population growth followed

by the Eastern province. Meanwhile, the lowest

contributions towards population growth were from

the Uva and Northern provinces. The Western

province continued to account for the highest share

of mid-year population of 28.1 per cent, followed

by the Central and Southern provinces accounting

for shares of 12.7 per cent and 12.2 per cent of

the mid-year population, respectively, in 2021,

continuing the same trend observed. Meanwhile,

the Northern province continued to account for the

lowest share of mid-year population of 5.3 per cent.

In line with the population growth, the population

density also increased to 353 people per square

kilometre in 2021, from 350 people per square

kilometre in 2020. As seen in the recent years,

the female population continued to remain higher

than the male population and the share of elderly

population remained at the same significant level

during the period under review.

Labour Force

The labour force, which is the economically

active population,6 increased to 8.553 million

in 2021 from 8.467 million recorded in 2020,

recording a growth of 1.0 per cent. This growth

was driven by the increases in labour force in all three

sectors namely, urban, rural and estate. Meanwhile,

the economically inactive population also increased

significantly further to 8.581 million in 2021 from

8.273 million in 2020 with the subdued interest in

active job search and pandemic induced hardships

on usual routines. This increase was largely driven

by the increase in the inactivity in the rural sector,

particularly related to rural females. Following the

6 This is the current economically active population, i.e. the number of persons (aged 15 years and above), who are employed or unemployed during the reference one-week period.

increase in both labour force and inactive population,

the labour force participation rate (LFPR), which

is the ratio of the labour force to the household

population, decreased to 49.9 per cent in 2021 from

50.6 per cent in 2020. Accordingly, the male and

female LFPRs also decreased to 71.0 per cent and

31.8 per cent, respectively, in 2021 from

71.9 per cent and 32.0 per cent, respectively, in

2020. On a positive note, the gender gap in LFPR

reduced to 39.2 per cent in 2021 from 39.8 per cent

in 2020, however yet to return to pre-pandemic levels.

Employment

The employed population7 increased to

8.114 million in 2021 from 7.999 million in

2020, though not yet recovered up to the

pre-pandemic employment levels. The increase

in employment was mainly driven by the increase

in employment opportunities related to Agriculture

and Services activities. Accordingly, employment

in Agriculture increased to 2.213 million in 2021

from 2.170 million in 2020, while that of Services

increased to 3.791 million in 2021 from 3.677 million

in 2020. However, amid the persistent adversities

faced, the employment in Industry continued to

decline to 2.109 million in 2021 from 2.153 million

in 2020. Accordingly, the shares of employment in

the Agriculture and Services sectors increased to

27.3 per cent and 46.7 per cent, respectively, in

2021 from 27.1 per cent and 46.0 per cent in 2020,

whereas the share of employment in the Industry

sector declined to 26.0 per cent in 2021 from

26.9 per cent in 2020.

As per the Public Sector Employment

Survey conducted by the Central Bank,

total public sector employment increased to

1.493 million at the end of 2021 compared to

1.461 million in 2020. This includes employees in

ministries, departments, district secretariats, divisional

7 Persons who worked at least one hour during the reference period, as paid employees, employers, own account workers or contributing family workers are said to be employed. This also includes persons with a job but not at work during the reference period.

secretariats, provincial councils and semi government

institutions. The increase observed in public sector

employment was due to the continued recruitment of

unemployed graduates and multi task development

officers, and recruitments related to armed and

police forces, and health sector. Meanwhile, as per

the quarterly labour force survey conducted by the

DCS, public sector employees, employers and own

account workers increased notably in 2021 compared

to 2020, whereas the private sector employment

declined marginally in line with the continued

terminations amidst the interminable difficulties

encountered by the private sector companies due

to the pandemic. Nevertheless, the private sector

continued to remain the main employment generator

in Sri Lanka representing the largest share of 42.0

per cent followed by own account workers, which

accounted for 33.4 per cent of the total employment

during 2021.

Unemployment

The unemployment rate declined to 5.1

per cent in 2021 from 5.5 per cent recorded in

2020 in line with the creation of new employment

opportunities. Accordingly, the unemployed

population8 declined to 0.440 million in 2021 from

0.468 million recorded in 2020. Consequently, the

male and female unemployment rates declined to

3.7 per cent and 7.9 per cent, respectively, in 2021

8 Persons available and/or looking for work, and who did not work and took steps to find a job during the last four weeks and are ready to accept a job given a work opportunity within next two weeks are said to be unemployed.

from 4.0 per cent and 8.5 per cent, respectively, in

2020. Further, the unemployment rate of the GCE

A/L and above category, declined considerably to 9.1

per cent in 2021 from 9.8 per cent recorded in 2020.

However, the youth (15-24 years) unemployment

rate remained unchanged at 26.5 per cent in 2021

compared to 2020 indicating the continued lack

of job opportunities at the entry level. Further, the

overall unemployment rate still remains above the

pre-pandemic levels as job opportunities created in

2021 were insufficient to reverse the considerable

number of terminations that took place in 2020 and

continued in 2021.

Foreign Employment

Departures for foreign employment

recorded a significant growth of 126.8 per cent

to 121,795 in 2021 from 53,711 in 2020 in line

with the significant improvement in departures

towards the latter part of the year. Accordingly,

the departures for foreign employment in the final

quarter of 2021 was recorded at 61,447, highest ever

reported since the third quarter of 2016. Relaxed

travel restrictions and increase in employment

opportunities in labour receiving countries, the

large number of prospective migrant workers who

were waiting to travel overseas for jobs and the fast

vaccination of prospective migrant workers drove

this significant increase in departures for foreign

employment. Accordingly, the share of male and

female departures for foreign employment stood

at 66.2 per cent and 33.8 per cent, respectively,

to the total departures of foreign employment.

In line with the increase in total departures for foreign

employment, departures for foreign employment

under all categories, namely professional, middle

level, clerical and related, skilled, semi-skilled,

unskilled and housemaid improved, where the

major contributions were from the skilled, unskilled

and housemaid categories. The Middle East region

continued to lead as the key foreign employment

destination in 2021 as well, accounting for 84.8

per cent of the total departures for foreign

employment, with 87.7 per cent of those being to

departures for foreign employment is envisaged for

2022 amid further improvements observed during

the first quarter of 2022.

Labour Productivity

Labour productivity, measured in terms

of Gross Value Added (GVA) (in 2010 prices)

per hour worked, declined by 2.6 per cent to

Rs. 562.15 per hour worked in 2021 from

Rs. 577.36 per hour worked in 2020.9

Even though, increases in GVA were observed

related to all three activities namely, Agriculture,

9 The significant increase in labour productivity in 2020 was due to the substantial reduction in hours worked amid tighter mobility restrictions that prevailed to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Industry and Services in 2021 compared to

2020, the overall labour productivity declined

slightly solely due to the considerable

recovery in hours worked amid lesser

mobility restrictions prevailed during the year.

Accordingly, labour productivity in Agriculture,

Industry and Services activities declined to

Rs. 175.64 per hour worked, Rs. 598.78 per hour

worked and Rs. 734.94 per hour worked,

respectively, in 2021 from Rs. 178.37 per hour

worked, Rs. 611.90 per hour worked and

Rs. 764.25 per hour worked, respectively, in 2020.

In terms of the level of productivity, Services

activities continued to exhibit the most efficient use

of labour resources, recording the highest labour

productivity level, followed by Industry activities,

while Agriculture activities recorded the lowest.
