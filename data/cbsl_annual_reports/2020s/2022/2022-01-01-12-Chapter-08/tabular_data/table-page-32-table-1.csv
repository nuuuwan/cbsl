Financial  inclusion  is  a  state  where  all  individuals  and 
risks, difficulties due to financial malpractices and make 
enterprises in Sri Lanka can access high-quality, appropriate, 
secure,  and  affordable  financial  services  based  on  their 
them  more  vulnerable 
to  poverty.  The  potential 
for 
needs  and  an 
further  growth  in  usage  of  digital  payments  and  other 
Digital  Financial  Services  has  been  highlighted  by  the 
National Financial Inclusion Survey 2018. However, the 
nation has failed in reaping maximum possible benefits 
to a sustainable extent, due to lack of financial skills and 
capability  to  make  use  of  available  financial  products 
and  services.  Lack  of  an  effective  regulatory  authority 
and  legal  protection  for  affected  groups  have  been 
the major factors that have contributed to the financial 
exclusion practices observed in Sri Lanka.   
In this context, the formulation of the National Financial 
Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) of Sri Lanka is considered as a 
timely  initiative,  bringing  together  all  key  stakeholders 
for the first time to carry out a long-term, comprehensive 
and 
coordinated 
inclusion  in  Sri  Lanka.  The  development  of  the  NFIS 
has  been  led  by  the  CBSL  with  the  collaboration  of 
all 
stakeholders, 
including  government 
formal  financial  service  providers  and  other  relevant 
professional  bodies.  The  NFIS  was  approved  by  the 
Cabinet  of  Ministers  in  March  2020  and  launched  in 
March 2021 by the CBSL and currently in operation in 
collaboration with more than 20 implementing entities. 
NFIS Policy Framework and Implementation
The  aim  of 
the  NFIS 
is 
to  provide  a 
comprehensive, 
approach for all stakeholders to move towards improving 
the financial inclusiveness of the country. 
The vision of the NFIS of Sri Lanka provides the strategic 
direction  for  the  priorities  of  the  Strategy,  that  reflects 
the aspirational, long-term goal that stakeholders of the 
NFIS seek to collaboratively achieve.
""Better quality inclusion for better lives""
All individuals and enterprises in Sri Lanka have 
well-informed, fair and equitable access to a 
range of high-quality, appropriate, secure and 
affordable financial products and services that

The  vision 
incorporates
