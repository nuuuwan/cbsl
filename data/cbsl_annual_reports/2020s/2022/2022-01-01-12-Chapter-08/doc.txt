8.1 OverviewA

midst strong macroeconomic headwinds, the stability of the financial system was preserved during

2021. Financial intermediation by the banking sector was satisfactory, while adequate capital and

liquidity buffers were maintained. In addition, the profitability of the sector improved considerably

during 2021 compared to the previous year due to notable increases in both net interest income and non-

interest income. However, banks faced a foreign currency liquidity shortage due to several sovereign rating

downgrades and the lack of foreign inflows experienced by the country. The performance of the Licensed

Finance Companies (LFCs) and Specialised Leasing Companies (SLCs) sector recorded a considerable

improvement in terms of credit growth and profitability on an overall basis. In order to build strong and

stable LFCs in the medium term and safeguard depositors of the sector, the implementation of the Financial

Sector Consolidation Masterplan progressed during 2021. Furthermore, to ensure the flexibility in adapting

to the new normal and to provide continuous support to the COVID-19 affected economy, the Central Bank

relaxed some of the regulations pertaining to financial institutions under its purview during the period under

review. The insurance sector also recorded an expansion in terms of assets and gross written premium while

marking a marginal contraction in profits. Meanwhile, the performance of financial markets was mixed during

2021. Money market liquidity, which remained at a surplus level during the first seven months of 2021, turned

to a deficit as a result of foreign debt repayments and reversal of the accommodative monetary policy stance.

The domestic foreign exchange (FX) market liquidity was severely affected due to slow recovery of tourism

and earnings from subdued remittances, slow conversion of export proceeds, increased import expenditure,

and sovereign rating downgrades. Investor preference towards short term Treasury bills was experienced at

the primary auctions of the government securities market during the latter part of 2021, and the secondary

market yield curve shifted upward during the second half of 2021 with the removal of the maximum yield

rate and the reversal of the accommodative monetary policy stance. With the shift of domestic investor

preference to the equity market in a low interest rate environment, the Colombo Stock Exchange reported an

exponential growth during 2021. Meanwhile, the country’s systemically important payment and settlement

system was operated smoothly by the Central Bank, with a high degree of resilience through close regulation

and monitoring. Further, the Central Bank continued to introduce law reforms to major legislation with the

view of providing a stronger legal foundation for the

regulatory and supervisory framework. The Central

Bank concluded the second round of discussions

pertaining to a new Banking Act in 2021 and

prepared amendments to the Finance Business

Act No. 42 of 2011 to enhance regulatory and

supervisory powers of the Central Bank.

8.2 Performance of the Banking Sector

The banking sector expanded at a moderate

pace during 2021 compared to the last year

and remained resilient with adequate capital

and liquidity buffers, amidst strong challenges

stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and

related macroeconomic issues. Despite the

continuation of debt moratoria for certain sectors

and gradual lapses of the concessions introduced

by the Central Bank, the banking sector was able

to meet the minimum prudential requirements in

terms of capital and liquidity.

The banking sector continued to dominate

the financial sector accounting for 63.3

per cent of total assets as at end 2021. Despite

the challenging economic environment driven

by the ongoing pandemic and macroeconomy

related concerns, the banking sector maintained

reasonable credit growth during 2021. Deposits

remained the dominant source of funding, while a

notable incline in rupee borrowings was observed

during 2021. However, sourcing foreign borrowings

from external sources was affected by sovereign

rating downgrades. During 2021, the banking sector

profitability improved considerably compared to

the previous year due to notable increases in net

interest income and non-interest income.

Business Expansion: By end 2021, the

banking sector comprised 30 banks, i.e., 24

Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs), including

11 branches of foreign banks, and 6 Licensed

Specialised Banks (LSBs). The banking sector

continued with its intermediation role and expanded

the banking network to facilitate financial inclusion.

In 2021, with the restrictions on physically accessing

banks due to the pandemic, most banks introduced

technology based online products/services to

customers to facilitate their banking needs.

Assets: The banking sector asset base

increased by Rs. 2.3 trillion during the year

and surpassed Rs. 16.9 trillion by end 2021,

recording a year-on-year growth of 15.4

per cent compared to 17.1 per cent growth

reported as at end 2020. Such asset growth

was mainly driven by loans and advances and

investments. The growth in loans and advances

increased from 11.9 per cent in 2020 to 15.3

per cent in 2021. Approximately, 92.2 per cent

of the increase in the loan portfolio during 2021

was attributed to the increase in rupee loans. The

increase in credit was diversified across the major

sectors of the economy. In terms of products,

overdrafts (40.7 per cent), pawning advances (21.5

per cent) and credit cards (12.6 per cent) reported

high growth during 2021. Meanwhile, the year-on-

year growth in investments decelerated from 40

per cent as at end 2020 to 16.4 per cent as at end

2021. The Held to Maturity (HTM) portfolio grew

by 24.8 per cent during 2021 due to increased

investments in Treasury bonds by Rs. 903.7

billion and decreased investments in Treasury bills

and Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) by

Rs. 99.8 billion and Rs. 55 billion, respectively. The

trading portfolio contracted by 21.2 per cent, with

declines in investments in Treasury bills, Treasury

bonds and SLDBs by Rs. 50 billion, Rs. 47.6 billion

and Rs. 63.8 billion, respectively, in nominal terms.

Liabilities: Deposits continued to be

the main source of funding followed by

borrowings. Term deposits accounted for 42.7

per cent of the increase in deposits during 2021

despite a decrease in its share in total deposits

from 63 per cent as at end 2020 to 60.6 per cent

as at end 2021. Meanwhile, savings and current

deposits accounted for 29.5 per cent and 7

per cent, respectively, of total deposits as at

end 2021. Accordingly, the Current and Savings

Account (CASA) ratio increased from 34.5 per cent

in 2020 to 36.6 per cent in 2021. Given the reduced

rate of growth in total deposits during 2021, banks

were compelled to increase their borrowings. Total

borrowings of the banking sector increased by

Rs. 489 billion (28.9 per cent) in 2021 compared

to the increase of Rs. 12.8 billion (0.8 per cent)

in 2020. This increase was mainly attributed to

rupee borrowings which reported a growth of 86.6

per cent (Rs. 688 billion), while foreign currency

borrowings decreased by 27.6 per cent (USD 1.3

billion) during 2021 reflecting the negative impact

of the sovereign rating downgrades.

Off-balance sheet exposures: Due to the

challenging business environment, off-balance

sheet exposures reported a negative growth of

3.2 per cent (decrease of Rs. 160.6 billion) during

2021 compared to a growth of 16.1 per cent

(Rs. 675.2 billion) recorded during 2020.

Significant decreases were observed in FX

exposures (Rs. 410.9 billion) and undrawn credit

lines (Rs. 81.5 billion), while guarantees & bonds

(Rs. 139 billion) and trade related exposures

(documentary credit (Rs. 138.9 billion) and

acceptances (Rs. 92 billion) reported increases

during 2021.

Risks in the Banking Sector

Credit Risk

As the pandemic continued during 2021 in

different scales, several extensions until 2022

were granted for the debt moratoria offered for

pandemic affected individuals and businesses

in certain sectors. Classification of loans and

advances to non-performing categories was frozen

during the period under moratoria, and normal

classification rules will be applied upon cessation of

the moratoria. However, banks have commenced

identifying risk elevated sectors due to COVID-19

for estimating expected credit losses. Despite the

freezing of classification of credit facilities under

moratoria, Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) increased

by Rs. 20.1 billion during 2021 compared to an

increase of Rs. 66.4 billion during 2020. However,

due to the comparatively higher increase in loans

and advances during 2021, the gross NPL ratio

decreased from 4.9 per cent as at end 2020 to 4.5

per cent by end 2021. With the downward migration

of NPLs to categories requiring higher provisions,

the net NPL ratio also reduced during 2021. The

total loan loss provisions increased by Rs. 80.2

billion, of which specific provisions accounted for

84.7 per cent. Despite the increase in NPLs, the

higher increase in provisions resulted in increases

in specific and total provision coverage ratios to 64

per cent and 75.8 per cent, respectively, in 2021.

As a result, the credit risk is at a manageable level

as the banking sector operated with sufficient

provisions and capital buffers to absorb the adverse

impact arising from credit shocks.

Out of the total loan portfolio, 63.8 per cent

of loans were mainly concentrated in 5 sectors

comprising of consumption, construction

& infrastructure, trade, manufacturing, and

agriculture. Manufacturing, wholesale & retail

trade, agriculture, construction, forestry & fishing,

and tourism sectors reported NPL ratios higher

than the total banking sector average of 4.5

per cent as at end 2021.

In addition, according to the Sri Lanka

Financial Reporting Standards 9 (SLFRS 9)

after the implementation of the expected loss

model, the ratio of stage 3 loans to total loans

in the banking sector indicated 7.64 per cent

and the ratio of stage 3 loans (net of stage

3 impairment) to total loans (net of stage 3

impairment) indicated 4.26 per cent as at end

2021.

Market Risk

Interest Rate: The interest rate sensitivity

ratio (interest bearing assets as a share of

interest-bearing liabilities with maturities of

less than 12 months) increased to 79.6 per cent

as at end 2021 from 74.9 per cent as at end

2020, indicating a reduction in the exposure to

interest rate risk by end 2021 compared to end

2020. Capital gains on Treasury bonds during 2021

stood at Rs. 4.1 billion and was lower than Rs. 12.2

billion recorded during 2020. This was mainly due

to the low interest rates that prevailed in 2020 that

led to higher gains while the upward adjustment of

interest rates was observed during the latter half

of 2021 with the tightening of the monetary policy.

Equity Prices: The equity risk of the

banking sector was minimal throughout 2021.

The exposure of banks’ trading portfolio to the

equity market was Rs. 12.5 billion, which was only

0.1 per cent and 2.1 per cent of the total assets

and investments held for trading, respectively, as

at end 2021.

Exchange Rates: The net foreign currency

exposure of the banking sector increased to

a long position of US dollars 133.2 million as

at end 2021 compared to a short position of

US dollars 30 million as at end 2020, with a

higher decrease in foreign currency liabilities

percentage of banks’ on-balance sheet foreign

currency assets stood at 1.3 per cent as at end

2021, increasing from 0.3 per cent at end 2020.

During 2021, on-balance sheet foreign currency

assets increased mainly due to the increase in

loans, placements with banks and investments,

and the increase was lower than the decrease in

off-balance sheet assets resulting from decreases

in forward purchases and other derivative

products. Meanwhile the increase in on-balance

sheet foreign currency liabilities was attributed

to the increase in customer deposits and the

decrease in off-balance sheet liabilities was

mainly from forward sales. The banking sector

reported a net foreign currency revaluation gain of

Rs. 28.7 billion during 2021 compared to Rs. 16.5

billion during 2020.

Liquidity Risk: On an overall basis, the

banking sector was in compliance with the

minimum Statutory Liquid Assets Ratio

(SLAR) of 20 per cent. The Domestic Banking

Units (DBUs) of LCBs and LSBs are required to

maintain a minimum SLAR of 20 per cent. SLAR of

DBUs declined from 37.8 per cent as at end 2020

to 33.8 per cent as at end 2021, while the SLAR of

Off-shore Banking Units (OBUs) decreased

from 43.2 per cent to 34 per cent during the

corresponding period. Despite the higher increase

in credit during 2021, the credit to deposits and

borrowings ratio decreased marginally while the

liquid assets to total assets and liquid assets to

deposits ratios decreased.

The rupee and all currency Liquidity

Coverage Ratios (LCRs), which is the stock

of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets

that can be converted easily and immediately

into cash in the secondary market to meet

liquidity needs for a period of 30 days under

a liquidity stress scenario of the banking

industry stood at 217.8 per cent and 171.8

per cent, respectively, by end 2021, well above

the regulatory minimum of 100 per cent. In

addition, the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR),

i.e., the amount of available stable funding relative

to the amount of required stable funding, stood

at 135.1 per cent by end 2021, well above the

regulatory requirement of 100 per cent. Total liquid

assets amounted to Rs. 5 trillion as at end 2021,

of which investments in government securities

represented 75.2 per cent. The cumulative maturity

gap as a percentage of cumulative liabilities of

the banking sector for maturity buckets less than

30 days and beyond 12 months widened as at

end 2021 compared to end 2020, indicating better

management of assets and liabilities in the short

term, considering the declining trend in interest

rates where more liabilities get repriced at lower

banks being able to meet the minimum liquidity

requirements, excessive widening of the maturity

gap may lead to an increase in liquidity risk.

Performance of the Banking Sector

Profitability: Interest income of the banking

sector increased by 3.2 per cent compared

to a decrease of interest expenses by 11.5

per cent during 2021, resulting in an increase

in net interest income by 28.5 per cent. As a

result, the net interest margin increased from 3.1

per cent as at end 2020 to 3.4 per cent as at end

2021. Net interest income increased by Rs. 121.8

billion during 2021 compared to the previous

year, while non-interest income increased by

Rs. 24.6 billion, mainly due to higher foreign

currency revaluation gains during 2021. Non-

interest expenses increased by Rs. 47.4 billion,

largely due to the increase in staff cost by Rs. 20.5

billion, while loan loss provisions increased by

Rs. 7.7 billion during 2021 compared to 2020. As

a result, profit before corporate tax was Rs. 258.7

billion in 2021 as per the regulatory reporting, which

was Rs. 69 billion more than the previous year.

Profit after tax of the banking industry was

Rs. 198.4 billion by end 2021 which recorded

an increase of 46 per cent compared to the

previous year. The increase in profits was

reflected in Return on Assets (ROA) – before

through retention of profits (Rs. 70 billion) and

issuance of new shares (Rs. 16.8 billion) during

2021. The regulatory capital of the banking sector

reported a growth of 4.3 per cent during the year,

of which Tier 1 capital contributed to 75.7 per cent

of the increase.

Supervisory and Regulatory Developments during 2021

During 2021, the Central Bank continued

to introduce prudential policy measures and

regulations to strengthen the financial and

operational resilience of licensed banks to ensure

the safety and soundness of the banking sector.

In the meantime, the Central Bank cautiously

relaxed some of the regulations to facilitate the

banking sector to adjust to the new normal and

to continue providing concessions to economic

sectors affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.

The Central Bank introduced a priority sector

lending target on credit granted by licensed banks

to individuals and businesses in the Micro, Small

and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector, with a

view to promoting economic sectors with high

growth potential in terms of domestic economic

growth and exports earnings leading to a broad

based revival of the economy. Accordingly,

licensed banks were required to increase their

credit to individuals and businesses in the MSME

sector by not less than 20 per cent per annum on

year-on-year basis, over the outstanding stock

of lending to MSMEs at the end of the previous

year. Further, licensed banks were also required

to suspend recovery actions against paddy millers

in the Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) sector

for a period of six months, starting from 1 January

2021, considering the Government’s initiatives

to support SME paddy millers affected by the

COVID-19 pandemic, for the upcoming harvesting

season.

the efficiency ratio improved from 51.8 per cent in

2020 to 48.1 per cent in 2021 as a result of the

decrease in operating costs.

Capital: The banking sector was in

compliance with the capital requirements

during 2021. None of the banks drew down the

capital conservation buffer during the period

concerned.

Considering the challenges in raising fresh

capital, the deadline to meet the enhanced

minimum capital requirement for banks was

extended till December 2022. Banks were

encouraged to raise high quality capital after

recognising the first day impact from implementation

of SLFRS 9. As a result, banks raised Tier I capital

The Central Bank continued its efforts to

support businesses and individuals affected

by the COVID-19 pandemic, while ensuring the

safety and soundness of the financial system,

despite the impact of the prolonged debt

moratoria. Policy measures adopted include

providing concessions for lease facilities obtained

by the affected businesses and individuals

engaged in passenger transportation services for

six months commencing from April 2021, extending

the debt moratoria granted to COVID-19 affected

businesses and individuals in the tourism sector for

another six months commencing from April 2021,

and extending the relief measures and concessions

provided to businesses and individuals who were

adversely affected by the third wave of COVID-19

outbreak. These concessions were subsequently

extended in September 2021 until end 2021, and

in the case of the tourism sector, up to end June

2022, considering the subsequent upsurge of

the pandemic. As at end 2021 approximately 6

per cent of the loans of the banking sector were

under moratoria. However, the potential impact of

these loans will be net of the underlying security

values and impairment already made on these

loans.

As an alternative to moratoria, banks were

requested to consider providing the borrowers

with an option to restructure their existing

facilities over a longer tenure at the prevailing

low interest rates in the market, considering the

future cash flows and subject to the submission

of a viable revival plan. Further, the suspension

of all types of recovery actions such as ‘parate’

execution and forced repossession of leased

assets against affected borrowers was extended

until end March 2022 and until end June 2022 for

the tourism industry.

The restrictions imposed on discretionary

payments of licensed banks were temporarily

relaxed in January 2021 and reimposed in July

2021. Accordingly, licensed banks were permitted

to pay cash dividends and repatriate profits only

after the completion of the audit of the financial

statements for the year 2020, while refraining

from engaging in share buy-backs and increasing

non-essential expenditure and exercising extreme

due diligence and prudence when incurring

capital expenditure until end June 2021. The

restrictions were reviewed and reimposed in July

2021, in light of the possible adverse impact on

liquidity and other key performance indicators of

licensed banks due to the subsequent upsurge of

the COVID-19 pandemic.

During 2021, the Central Bank continued to

take proactive regulatory measures to curtail the

possible/potential outflow of foreign exchange

from licensed banks to avoid excess volatility

in the foreign exchange market, to ease the

pressure on the exchange rate, and minimise

the impact on banks’ risk management. These

measures included temporary restrictions on

entering forward contracts of foreign exchange

by licensed banks, margin requirements against

imports and the temporary suspension of the

purchase of Sri Lanka International Sovereign

Bonds (ISBs) by LCBs and National Savings

Bank (NSB). Further, the Central Bank introduced

amendments to the Banking Act Directions on

foreign currency borrowings by licensed banks

to stimulate capital formation in the real economy

and to support the foreign currency needs of the

country.

The credit risk management and governance

framework in relation to financial instruments

of licensed banks were strengthened and

aligned with the classification, recognition

and measurement criteria for credit facilities

and other financial assets under the Sri Lanka

Accounting Standard ‘SLFRS 9: Financial

Instruments’ to establish consistent and prudent

practices in the banking industry. It is expected

that the implementation of these new Directions

will facilitate a more accurate assessment of the

current as well as potential future risks of credit

facilities and other financial assets of licensed

banks.

Improving the operational resilience of the

licensed banks was one of the key focus areas

of the Central Bank during 2021. Accordingly,

in June 2021, licensed banks were informed

to maintain recovery plans to deal with shocks

to capital, liquidity and all other aspects that

may arise from institution-specific stresses,

market-wide stresses, or a combination of both.

A regulatory framework for technology risk

management and resilience of licensed banks

was introduced to prompt banks to upgrade

and strengthen their information systems and

technology platforms in line with international

standards and best practices. This framework sets

minimum regulatory requirements on technology

risk management and resilience for licensed banks

in general as well as based on the sensitivity of

data, the criticality of information systems, and

the type of information system infrastructure used.

These requirements are also aimed at improving

the governance framework for technology risk

management.

Maximum interest rates on foreign currency

deposits of LCBs and NSB were imposed

considering the prevailing interest rates of foreign

currency denominated deposits, and maximum

interest rates on mortgage-backed housing loans

were also imposed considering the current and

expected macroeconomic developments.

Several other policy measures were

also introduced in 2021 as per regulatory

requirements. These include amending capital

requirements under Basel III for licensed banks on

the risk weights applicable for foreign claims on the

central Government, determination of Thai Baht

as a designated foreign currency, recognition of

Lanka Rating Agency Ltd. as an acceptable credit

rating agency, provision of banking services during

the lockdown periods, and introduction of a new

structure for the annual license fee of licensed banks

for the year 2022. The list of all policy changes and

measures introduced during 2021 is available in the

Major Economic Policy Measures 2021 section of

this report.

The Central Bank upgraded its Statutory

Examinations of banks to a more robust risk based

examination mechanism and a comprehensive

supervisory guidance framework based on the

internal rating model named Bank Sustainability

Rating Indicator (BSRI). Accordingly, internal ratings

were assigned to all 30 licensed banks and statutory

examinations of all banks were conducted in line with

the BSRI framework and BSRI is being improved to

facilitate risk based supervision. Ways and means

to improve internal ratings assigned to banks will

be focused during future statutory examinations

by allocating more resources to examine high risk

areas and weak/inefficient operations of banks.

Further, Consolidated Risk Based Supervision of

selected banking groups was conducted, extending

the scope of statutory examinations of the Central

Bank to the risks stemming from group entities.

The biggest economic challenge faced by humankind in the past century

COVID-19 is arguably the biggest health and economic challenge faced by humankind in this century. In 2020, over 90 per cent of the countries worldwide recorded contractions in their economic activities. The interconnectedness and interdependence of the global economy made the impact of the pandemic unprecedented, surpassing the effects of the two world wars, the great depression, and the global financial crisis (The World Bank, 2022).

How did Central banks react to COVID-19?

Central banks and monetary authorities worldwide introduced both conventional and unconventional policy responses to address the multifaceted challenges of the pandemic. These measures include monetary policy relaxations, asset repurchasing/quantitative easing programmes, and regulatory forbearances, as well as government-led fiscal measures such as tax reductions/deferments, direct cash payments, insolvency support and payment freezes/moratoria (International Monetary Fund, 2022).

In the wake of the pandemic, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) also introduced a series of extraordinary policy measures to provide liquidity to the economy and regulatory forbearances to provide operational flexibility to licensed banks and non-banking financial institutions (NBFIs), (hereinafter referred to as financial institutions, FIs) to assist their customers.

Accordingly, CBSL requested FIs to provide a six-month moratorium on capital and interest payments on loans obtained by borrowers affected by the pandemic and to waive off any accrued and unpaid penal interest charged on such loans. Considering the subsequent waves of the pandemic, this was extended for more than 18 months for customers who were severely affected.

Additionally, CBSL also introduced a Rs. 50 billion refinancing and credit guarantee scheme to provide low-cost funding for Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) customers, reduced interest rates on targeted lending products, provided liquidity facility to the construction sector and other government suppliers, suspended recovery actions against non-performing loans, and reduced fees and charges on several banking services to provide relief to retail customers.

New Challenges and Opportunities created by the Pandemic

COVID-19 affected businesses disproportionately. Some businesses and economic sectors came to a complete standstill while some found new opportunities and avenues to grow their businesses amidst the pandemic.

BOX 9COVID-19 Concessions and Moratoria: Challenges and Way Forward

As the pandemic unfolds, many businesses worldwide adopted remote working and flexible working arrangements, which have now become a norm due to its’ versatility and cost savings. Similarly, many businesses have already replaced expensive business travels and meetings with online conferences and virtual meetings. These shifts in preferences have forced businesses to rewire their infrastructure to be predominantly hybrid (Sadun, Simcoe, & Conti, 2021; Nugent, 2021). Further, the increased consumer preferences towards digital services and online shopping have pushed many businesses in the service sector such as supermarkets, retail, fashion, and entertainment to bring their businesses mobile-first. This phenomenon was also apparent in the local context such as increasing demand for online retail shopping, video consultations for doctors, online learning and tuition service providers and reduced demand for cinemas, large wedding receptions, concerts, exhibitions, and events. While these changes affected some businesses and their value chains adversely, many firms have embraced the change to spur innovation turning the changes into opportunities.

Similarly, FIs as well as the financial sector witnessed their fair share of pains and gains during the pandemic. Liquidity and credit risks were the most significant challenges faced by FIs worldwide during the pandemic. Closure of businesses, loss of jobs and income due to the pandemic and induced economic disruptions made it increasingly difficult for borrowers to honour their debt repayment obligations. Even for those who were repaying promptly, the probability of default in the future increased significantly, due to the increasing uncertainty in the global economy. This significantly impacted the asset quality of FIs. Liquidity positions of FIs also tightened as borrowers delayed their repayments and depositors withdrew their monies more often. This impaired FIs' ability to lend, curtailing credit flows to revive economic activities.

Raising new funds and rolling over the existing funding lines was another challenge faced by FIs as lenders, depositors, and investors of FIs were reluctant to commit more funds due to the increased uncertainty. This increased the cost of funding and refinancing risk of FIs.

The pandemic also increased other risks such as operational risk, health & safety risk, and business continuity risk. The increased reliance on digital delivery channels elevated the cybersecurity risk and technology risk, compelling FIs to commit more resources to mitigate these emerging risks and threats. Ultimately, the foregoing translated into increased strategic risk. FIs were required to reassess their risks, rearrange their priorities, and refocus their business directions as strategies planned before the pandemic became no

longer valid in the “new normal”.

However, certain business segments such as online banking, cashless payments and digital wallets witnessed exponential growth during the pandemic. FIs benefited from the reduced interest rates generally observed globally and in the local context, and from the exchange rate movements, due to mark-to-market gains on foreign currency assets. CBSL monitored these developments and introduced timely regulatory measures, where necessary, to prudently manage the increased risks in the financial sector.

Balancing Basics: Concessions and Stability

CBSL, as the apex financial authority in the country, took timely measures to provide concessions and revive the affected economic sectors while avoiding excessive risk buildup which can impact the core objectives of CBSL: to maintain economic and price stability and the financial system stability.

CBSL introduced the debt moratorium as a short-term remedy for borrowers who faced cashflow difficulties amidst the pandemic and to prevent loans of such borrowers from getting into non-performing category and its ensuing consequences. However, as the tenure of the moratoria and the value of loans grew bigger, FIs had to find alternative funding to pay their depositors and to meet other operating costs during the moratorium period. Considering the above, CBSL permitted FIs to charge a nominal interest on the moratoria, sufficient to cover the costs of funds. Subsequently, CBSL initiated preparatory works to introduce a mechanism to provide a least-cost solution to both borrowers and FIs, having considered the difficulties faced by borrowers due to charging additional interest.

Despite sparking much debate among the public, this additional interest allowed FIs to permit their borrowers to defer loan repayments for more than 18 months, without creating undue stress on depositors’ funds and maintaining the stability of the individual FIs and the financial system.

Unwinding Moratoria: The Importance of Timing

As economic activities are returning to normalcy and countries opening their borders for trade, Central banks worldwide gradually phased out the extraordinary policy measures placed in response to COVID-19. However, experts warn that a premature upliftment of support measures that maintained liquidity and solvency of the economy may cause widespread credit constraints, debt foreclosures, insolvencies, and increased unemployment. This can be detrimental to post-pandemic economic revival and the self-reinforcing nature of these effects can have both short and long term consequences due to the feedback effect (Financial Stability Board, 2021).

On the other hand, maintaining support measures for

too long can result in increased indebtedness, excessive risk-taking by firms and households, increased credit risk and creating moral hazard. The cost of running concessions for too long can be prohibitively expensive for countries with tight fiscal positions. Further, it can also slow down the necessary economic adjustments such as culling weak and unviable business/business models to reallocate economic resources to more efficient sectors, and technological transformation (Financial Stability Board, 2021).

What’s beyond moratoria?

Unwinding moratoria and other relief measures can be challenging for both borrowers and FIs. As discussed above, the pandemic made permanent changes in several industries making some business models no longer profitable as they used to be (Jacobides & Reeves, 2020).

From a business continuity point of view, the pandemic was an acid test for firms that lack capital, contingency planning and agile decision making. For some firms, the main factor that kept such businesses afloat during the pandemic was the concessionary measures. Therefore, any efforts to revive businesses by FIs should focus on firms that are financially viable but suffering from liquidity and solvency problems caused directly by the pandemic. Also, such interventions should be transparent and should not distort the market competition (OECD, 2021).

Considering the above, CBSL issued guidelines to licensed banks to establish post-pandemic economic revival units in licensed banks to revive viable businesses. Accordingly, licensed banks will formulate revival plans and identify under-performing and non-performing borrowers with viable businesses who require rehabilitation assistance, including those who require liquidity support to unwind moratoria.

A mix of financial and non-financial assistance will be available to such borrowers to restructure/reschedule their existing credit facilities and will also grant additional credit facilities and/or any other appropriate support measures on a need basis to revive their businesses.

However, these will not be available to borrowers that have been identified as willful defaulters, defaulters who have diverted the borrowed funds for other purposes and those with unviable businesses or business projects and those who have defaulted due to mismanagement and/or fraud in their businesses.

The Way Forward: A Sustainable, Inclusive Economic Recovery

The end goal of all the above interventions is to minimise disruptions to the economy and restore normalcy in the livelihood of the people. In this regard, all stakeholders of the economy should collectively reflect on the lessons learnt from the pandemic and make conscious efforts to secure a sustainable and inclusive post-pandemic economic recovery.

Going forward, both FIs and firms should rethink their business models, explore new business opportunities created by the pandemic and redesign their processes and procedures to improve efficiency and competitiveness. Investing in technology and upgrading IT infrastructure while prudently managing increased risks will be another priority going forward. In doing so, they may also have to be mindful of their debt levels and seek to consolidate, restructure, or reschedule their debt to match their new cashflows and repayment capacities or find alternative avenues for low-cost funding or internal capital formation to maintain solvency and support such growth.

In this regard CBSL has initiated several policy measures to promote internal capital formation, recovery planning, technology risk management, provide long-term low-cost funding and orderly disposal of non-performing assets of FIs.

Business Expansion

Outreach: By end 2021, the sector comprised

39 LFCs1 and 3 SLCs. There were 1,707 branches

and 309 other outlets, of which 1,359 branches and

outlets (67.4 per cent) were located outside the

Western Province.

Assets: The asset base of the sector

increased by 6.1 per cent (by Rs. 86 billion) to

Rs. 1,487.7 billion in 2021, compared to the 2.2

per cent contraction observed in 2020. The sector

expansion was mainly driven by the growth in the

loans and advances portfolio. Loans and advances

accounted for 76.8 per cent of the total assets of

the sector. The loans and advances portfolio of the

sector was highly concentrated on finance leases

which accounted for 48.3 per cent of total loans and

advances as at end 2021. The growth of the leasing

portfolio declined mainly due to the restrictions

imposed by the Government on the importation of

motor vehicles as a measure to restrict FX outflows.

However, the loans and advances portfolio of the

sector recorded a growth during the year due to

the increase in other secured loans and advances

and pawing advances. Accordingly, the loans and

advances provided by the LFCs and SLCs sector

increased by 9.9 per cent (Rs. 102.7 billion) to

Rs. 1,142.5 billion in 2021 compared to the

contraction of 5.7 per cent in 2020.

SLCs sector comprises investments in equities,

corporate debt instruments, government

securities and investment properties. The

investment portfolio recorded only a marginal growth

of 5.4 per cent reaching Rs. 167.4 billion in 2021

compared to the significant growth of 20.2 per cent

in 2020, mainly due to the increased investments

in government securities maturing in less than 12

months. Other assets that mainly include cash and

cash balances with banks and financial institutions

declined by 12.4 per cent in 2021.

Liabilities: Customer deposits continued to

dominate the liabilities of the LFCs and SLCs

sector accounting for a share of 52.7 per cent.

The deposits increased by 4.6 per cent (Rs. 34.7

billion) to Rs. 783.3 billion, while borrowings declined

by 0.6 per cent (Rs. 2.1 billion) to Rs. 325.9 billion

during the year.

Profitability: The net interest income of the

sector significantly increased by 18.2 per cent

(Rs. 20.2 billion) in 2021 reaching Rs. 131.4

billion. This was due to the significant decline

in interest expenses by 27.1 per cent (Rs. 31.8

billion) despite the decline in interest income by 5

per cent (Rs. 11.5 billion). The net interest margin

of the sector (net interest income as a percentage

of average assets) increased to 8.6 per cent in

2021 from the 7.3 per cent in 2020, due to a greater

increase in the net interest income compared to the

marginal increase in (gross) average assets.

The non-interest income increased by 54.5

per cent (Rs. 17.5 billion) and non-interest

expenses increased by 11.1 per cent

(Rs. 8.7 billion) during 2021 which significantly

contributed to the profitability of the sector.

Non-interest expenses increased mainly due

to the increases in salaries, wages, and other

benefits to the staff (Rs. 4.7 billion), administrative

expenses (Rs. 2.8 billion), and other expenses

(Rs. 3 billion). The loan loss provisions made

against NPLs declined by Rs. 27.1 billion, largely

due to increased collection during the period. The

sector’s profit after tax significantly grew by 307.1

per cent from Rs. 13.7 billion in 2020 to Rs. 55.6

billion in 2021, mainly due to the substantial increase

in non-interest income by Rs. 17.5 billion including

gains from trading or investment securities by

Rs. 1.2 billion, service charges by Rs. 1.8 billion and

default charges by Rs. 6.8 billion. The increase in

profitability was reflected in the sharp increase in the

Return on Equity (ROE) to 20.2 per cent and Return

on Assets (ROA) before tax to 5.4 per cent in 2021,

relative to 6.1 per cent and 1.7 per cent recorded

respectively, in 2020. High ROA and ROE figures

would be beneficial for the sector’s capital generation

enabling the attraction of new investors to the

sector. The cost to income ratio also improved to 69

per cent in 2021, from 89.7 per cent in 2020, largely

due to the reduction in total expenses and increased

income during the period, while the efficiency ratio

improved to 51.3 per cent during 2021.

Capital: The sector continued to remain

resilient with capital maintained above the

minimum regulatory requirement during the

year. The capital base improved to Rs. 251.6 billion

by end 2021 compared to Rs. 218.9 billion recorded

by end 2020, with the infusion of new capital by

several LFCs to meet regulatory requirements of

Rs. 2 billion by 01 January 2021 and Rs. 2.5 billion

by 01 January 2022. The sector’s core capital and

total capital ratios increased to 15.5 per cent and 17

per cent, respectively, by end 2021 from the reported

levels of 14.5 per cent and 15.7 per cent at end 2020.

In 2021, the Masterplan was introduced to

build a strong and stable 25 Non-Bank Financial

Institutions complying with prudential

requirements with diversified business models.

6 preliminary approvals have already been

granted to 12 LFCs/SLCs for acquisitions and

amalgamations under the Masterplan. In addition

to the introduction of the Masterplan, several

regulatory actions were also initiated by the Central

Bank with a view to avoiding further deterioration

of the financial positions, maintaining the stability

of such institutions, and safeguarding the interests

of depositors.

Risks in the LFCs and SLCs Sector

Credit Risk: Total gross NPLs reduced by 13.9

per cent (Rs. 22. billion) by end December 2021

on a year-on-year basis, compared to an increase

of 26.2 per cent (Rs. 33.4 billion) recorded at end

December 2020. Although the gross NPL ratio

declined to 11 per cent by end 2021 from 13.9

per cent reported as at end 2020, still the NPL

ratio of the sector remains high. The net NPL ratio

reduced to 2.7 per cent by end 2021 from 4.2 per

cent reported by end 2020, due to higher provision

coverage for NPLs. The provision coverage ratio

increased to 66.8 per cent in December 2021,

compared to 58.9 per cent reported in December

2020. Though the underlying credit risk of the

sector still remains manageable, the impact of

the freezing of classification of loans under the

moratoria needs to be factored in when assessing

the credit risk of the sector. Similarly, following

the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increasing

trend in pawning advances and gold loans in 2021

(by Rs. 58 billion). Hence, any potential price

drop in the gold market would adversely affect the

performance of the sector and its NPLs.

Market Risk: The sector continued to

experience a low market risk which comprises

interest rate risk and equity risk.

Interest Rate Risk: With the recent persistent

upward revisions of Treasury bill interest rates,

reference rates for deposits were revised upward

from 01 November 2021. Accordingly, interest rate

risk may increase due the negative mismatch in

the maturity profile of the interest-bearing assets

and liabilities.

Equity Risk: Equity risk of the sector remained

low during the period under review as the exposure

to equity market in the form of investments in listed

shares declined to 0.8 per cent in 2021 from 1

per cent of total assets in 2020.

Liquidity Risk: The sector maintained liquidity

well above the minimum required level during 2021.

The overall regulatory liquid assets available in

the sector was Rs. 155.9 billion by end December

2021, against the stipulated minimum requirement

of Rs. 89.9 billion. However, the liquidity surplus

by end 2021 declined by 25.9 per cent (Rs. 23

billion) compared to the liquidity surplus of Rs. 89

billion recorded in December 2020, mainly due to

the increase in minimum liquidity requirements

consequent to the discontinuation of regulatory

relaxations imposed on liquid asset requirements in

response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The liquidity

ratio (liquid assets against deposits and borrowing)

increased to 14.1 per cent by end December 2021,

compared to 13 per cent recorded by end 2020.

Primary Dealer Companies in Government Securities

As at end 2021, there were 6 LCBs and 7

Primary Dealer Companies (PDCs) appointed

as Primary Dealers (PDs) in the government

securities market. Pan Asia Banking Corporation

PLC (PABC) and Perpetual Treasuries Limited

(PTL) were suspended from carrying on business

and activities of a PD on 15 August 2017 and 06

July 2017, respectively. The participation in primary

auctions was prohibited for Entrust Securities PLC

(ESP) w.e.f. 24 July 2017. Accordingly, only 5

LCBs and 5 PDCs were active in the government

securities market as PDs as at end of 2021.

Assets and Liabilities: Total assets of PDCs

decreased by 9.8 per cent to Rs. 78.7 billion in

2021. The total investment portfolio of government

securities, consisting of trading, available for sale

and HTM portfolios amounted to Rs. 70.5 billion as

at end 2021, which recorded a decline of 12 per cent

during the year. The trading portfolio decreased to

Rs. 54.9 billion by end 2021 from Rs. 62.6 billion

recorded as at end 2020, while the HTM portfolio

declined to Rs. 12 billion as at end 2021 from

Rs. 14.7 billion as at end 2020. The available for

sale portfolio increased to Rs. 3.6 billion by end of

2021 compared to Rs. 2.8 billion as at end 2020.

Profitability: PDCs reported a loss after

tax of Rs. 0.4 billion during 2021 compared to

the profit after tax of Rs. 4.9 billion reported

during 2020, indicating a significant decline in

profitability consequent to the increase in yield

rates. The significant drop in capital gains along

with the considerable increase in mark-to-market

losses recorded by PDCs in 2021 compared to

2020, largely contributed to the after-tax loss

reported in 2021. Furthermore, ROA and ROE

of PDCs contracted to negative 0.7 per cent and

negative 3.2 per cent, respectively, by end of 2021

from 7.6 per cent and 30.5 per cent, respectively,

as recorded in 2020.

Capital: Equity of PDCs contracted by 6.7

per cent mainly due to losses incurred during

the year. The Risk Weighted Capital Adequacy

Ratio (RWCAR) of the PDCs was well above the

minimum required amount of 10 per cent and

increased to 42.8 per cent as at end 2021 from 27

per cent reported as at end 2020.

Risks in the PDCs Sector

Market Risk: The proportion of the trading

portfolio in the total investment portfolio of PDCs

decreased marginally and was recorded at 77.9

per cent as at end 2021 compared to 78.2 per cent

as at end 2020, reflecting a marginal decrease in

the relative market risk exposure of the industry.

Liquidity Risk: The overall liquidity risk

exposure of PDCs increased due to the increase

in overnight negative mismatch in the maturity

profile of assets and liabilities of PDCs by

end 2021. The overnight negative mismatch

increased to Rs. 20.3 billion as at end 2021 from

Rs. 13 billion (79.5 per cent) as at end 2020.

This is an increase in overnight liabilities by 82.8

per cent as at end 2021. In view of holding a large

volume of government securities, which is free

of credit risk, by PDCs and the ability to use such

government securities as collateral for obtaining

funds to bridge any unforeseen liquidity gaps, the

liquidity risk profile of PDCs remained low throughout

the year except ESP which was facing liquidity

issues. Most of the PDCs had standby contingency

funding arrangements to bridge any liquidity gaps.

Market Conduct

Primary Market Activities: The participation

in primary auctions in respect of Treasury bills

and Treasury bonds by PDCs showed a mixed

performance during 2021. Of the total bids accepted

at 52 Treasury bills auctions conducted in 2021, the

effective participation of LCBs appointed as PDCs,

PDCs and Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF)

accounted to 43.1 per cent, 56.3 per cent and 0.6

per cent, respectively. At 22 Treasury bond auctions

conducted during 2021, effective participation

of LCBs appointed as PDCs, PDCs and EPF

accounted to 36 per cent, 27.5 per cent and 36.5

per cent, respectively.

Secondary Market Activities of PDCs:

Secondary market transactions in government

securities (in terms of value) by PDCs decreased

by 33.1 per cent to Rs. 5,068.3 billion in 2021, out

of which repo transactions accounted to 63.5

per cent. During 2021, outright purchases decreased

by 56 per cent and outright sales by PDCs increased

by 11.4 per cent, compared to 2020.

Licensed Microfinance Companies

The Licensed Microfinance Companies (LMFC)

sector consisted of 4 companies and reported a

27.2 per cent growth of its assets base reaching

Rs. 8.4 billion as at end 2021. Microfinance loans

and advances accounted for the largest share of

total assets with 74.6 per cent. Microfinance Loans

and Advances amounted to Rs. 6.3 billion as at end

2021 in comparison to the Rs. 5.3 billion as at end

2020, reporting a growth of 14.8 per cent. NPLs

of LMFCs stood at 16.8 per cent as at end 2021.

The total deposit base of the sector grew by 11

per cent in 2021 from Rs. 488 million in 2020 to

Rs. 544 million in 2021. Despite the increase in

total liabilities of the sector by 29 per cent from

Rs. 4.4 billion in 2020 to Rs. 5.5 billion in 2021, the

debt-to-equity ratio increased to 2.0 per cent by end

2021 with the increase of equity from 1.9 per cent

recorded at end 2020. In order to utilise the available

liquid assets to meet operational costs during the

COVID-19 pandemic, the Monetary Board continued

its decision to withdraw the requirement for LMFCs

to maintain liquid assets as per the Microfinance Act

No. 6 of 2016. The core capital level of the sector

remained at Rs. 2.7 billion and all LMFCs were in

compliance with the minimum prudential regulations

on core capital.

Unit Trusts

The number of Unit Trusts (UTs) remained

unchanged at 75 at end 2021 similar to end 2020,

while the number of UT management companies

decreased to 16 at end 2021, from 18 reported at

end 2020. The UTs funds were mainly dominated

by money market funds and followed by Income

Funds with the representation of 23 per cent and 21

per cent of the UT industry, respectively. In addition,

Gilt Edged Funds, Growth Funds and Balanced

Funds accounted for 15 per cent, 13 per cent and 12

per cent of the UT industry, respectively.

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

of net assets increased to 9.1 per cent at end

2021 compared to 7 per cent at end 2020.

Insurance Sector

By end 2021, there were 27 insurance

companies operating in the country

comprising 13 long term insurance

companies, 12 general insurance companies

and 2 companies involved in both long term

and general insurance business.

The insurance sector reported a modest

growth in its asset base in 2021. The total assets

of the insurance sector grew by 11.4 per cent by

end 2021 on a year-on-year basis and reached

Rs. 879.8 billion. The asset base of the long term

insurance subsector grew by 12.3 per cent to

Rs. 633 billion by end 2021 compared to a growth

of 16.1 per cent recorded at end 2020, whereas

the asset base of the general insurance subsector

increased by 9.2 per cent and reached Rs. 246.8

billion at end 2021. The share of the asset base of

the long term insurance subsector over the total

insurance sector asset base remained high at

71.9 per cent by end 2021 which was a marginal

increase from 71.4 per cent recorded by end 2020.

Corresponding to this increase, the share of general

insurance subsector assets over total assets

declined to 28.1 per cent by end 2021 from 28.6

per cent recorded at end 2020.

Gross written premium of the insurance

sector grew by 12.2 per cent to Rs. 233.8

contributing to 14.5 per cent of the financial

sector assets. The sector is dominated by the

EPF, which accounts for 81.7 per cent of the total

assets of the superannuation sector. In addition

to the EPF, there are two other publicly managed

funds, namely, the Employees’ Trust Fund (ETF)

and the state sector Public Service Provident Fund

(PSPF).

Employees’ Provident Fund

As per the Employees’ Provident Fund Act

No. 15 of 1958 (EPF Act), the Monetary Board

of the Central Bank is entrusted with the

custodianship of the Employees’ Provident

Fund (EPF/Fund), while the Commissioner

of Labour is entrusted with the general

administration of the Fund. The EPF Department

of the Central Bank facilitates the Monetary Board

to perform its duties and functions as per the

provisions of the EPF Act.

The total value of the Fund increased by

Rs. 341.8 billion to Rs. 3,166.1 billion as at

end 2021 from Rs. 2,824.3 billion reported by

end 2020, recording a 12.1 per cent growth.

This growth was an outcome of a combined effect

of the net contributions of the members (amount

of contributions received less refunds paid) and

the income generated through investments of

the Fund. Total liability to the members stood at

Rs. 3,066.9 billion as at end 2021 recording a 10.8

per cent increase from Rs. 2,767.8 billion as at

end 2020. The total contribution for the year 2021

increased by 9.9 per cent to Rs. 165.7 billion, while

the total amount of refunds to the members and their

legal heirs was Rs. 118.2 billion in 2021, which was

an increase of 7.7 per cent over 2020. Accordingly,

the net contribution to the Fund was Rs. 47.5 billion

compared to Rs. 41.0 billion recorded in the previous

year. The annual profit of the Fund increased by

22.1 per cent to Rs. 299.1 billion in 2021 from

Rs. 244.9 billion recorded in the previous year. This

was mainly due to the increase in the net gain on

financial instruments at fair value through profit or

loss (listed equities) by Rs. 36.8 billion.

The total investment portfolio (book value)

of the Fund grew by 12.2 per cent to Rs. 3,173.3

billion as at end of 2021 from Rs. 2,829.5 billion

as at end of 2020. The investment policy of the

Fund is focused on providing long term positive

real returns to the members, while ensuring the

safety of the Fund and the availability of adequate

level of liquidity to meet refund payments and other

expenses of the Fund. Accordingly, as at end of

2021, the investment portfolio consisted of 93.2

per cent in government securities, 3.8 per cent in

equity, 0.8 per cent in corporate debentures, 1.8

per cent in fixed deposits, and the remaining 0.4

per cent in Reverse Repurchase agreements.

Investment Income: The total investment

income of the Fund was Rs. 342.2 billion in

2021 and recorded an increase of 19.9 per cent

compared to previous year. Interest income

continued to be the major source of income to

the Fund which grew by 5.9 per cent to Rs. 293.7

billion in 2021 from Rs. 277.4 billion in 2020.

Dividend income increased by 124.0 per cent to

Rs. 6.7 billion in 2021 compared to Rs. 3.0 billion

in 2020. Net Gain/Loss on financial instruments at

fair value through profit or loss recorded a net gain

of Rs. 41.8 billion in 2021 compared to net gain of

Rs. 5.0 billion in 2020.

Overall Return of the Fund: The Fund earned

a total gross income of Rs. 342.4 billion in

2021, recording an increase of 19.9 per cent

compared to the previous year. After adjusting

for operating expenditure and tax expenditure, the

net profit for the year 2021 was Rs. 299.1 billion

which is an increase of 22.1 per cent compared

to that of 2020. Accordingly, the Return on

Average Investment of the EPF in 2021 was 11.40

per cent. Further, the Fund was able to maintain

operating expenses to gross income ratio at 0.48

per cent in 2021. However, the tax expenditure of

the Fund increased by Rs. 2.6 billion compared

to 2020 following the increase of profit in 2021.

Nevertheless, the adoption of SLFRS 9, the

Accounting Standard applicable for classification

and measurement of Financial Instruments, where

listed equity instruments are measured at fair

value and also due to the favourable performance

observed in the listed equity market, a net gain

of Rs. 41.8 billion was recorded as an income for

the year 2021. Accordingly, the EPF declared an

interest rate of around 9.00 per cent on member

balances in 2021.

Activities of the EPF Department were

conducted while adhering to the risk management

and internal control requirements in place, even

while experiencing certain disruptions during

the year to its regular operating mechanisms

due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, all

investment activities were conducted in line with

the requirements specified in the Monetary Board

approved Investment Policy Statement, Strategic

Asset Allocation and Investment Guidelines,

while ensuring the safety and optimal return to

the Fund. The investment climate prevailed in

the country during the year was quite challenging

due to significant changes in the market interest

rates, fluctuations in the equity market and

other economic conditions. Accordingly, robust

investment decisions were taken while addressing

any risks of the changing economic environment.

Further, actions were taken to revisit and revise

the prevailing investment guidelines in order to

facilitate investment decisions considering the

market conditions, international standards and

best practices with the collaboration of Risk

Management Department of the Central Bank.

Employees’ Trust Fund

The ETF, which contributed to 10.8

per cent of the asset base of the

superannuation sector, recorded an

improvement in its asset base, total

contributions, and investments while the

number of member accounts registered a

decline. Out of 14.7 million member accounts of

the ETF, only 2.1 million accounts were active as at

end 2021. The number of employers contributing to

the fund declined to 44,501 at end 2021 from 75,756

at end 2020. The total member balance of the ETF

increased by 8.3 per cent year-on-year to reach Rs.

406.3 billion at end 2021. The total contributions

received to the ETF increased by 11 per cent

year-on-year and reached Rs. 29.7 billion, while total

benefits paid to members increased by 6.6 per cent

year-on-year and reached Rs. 20.2 billion at end

2021.

Meanwhile, the total assets of the ETF

increased by 11.3 per cent year-on-year

and reached Rs. 419.1 billion at end 2021.

Investments made by the ETF increased to

Rs. 410.1 billion at end 2021, which is an increase

of 10.5 per cent compared to end 2020. Out of

these investments, 86 per cent was invested in

government securities at end 2021, compared to

80 per cent at end of the previous year. The share

of investments in fixed deposits considerably

decreased to 6.9 per cent at end 2021 compared

to 14.3 per cent at end 2020. The ETF managed

to pay a return of 7.3 per cent on its member

balances for 2021, a decline from the 8 per cent of

return paid during the previous year.

Other Superannuation Funds

The PSPF, which accounted for 2.2

per cent of the superannuation sector,

increased in terms of assets, investments, and

net contribution during 2021. The fund grew

by 19.1 per cent and reached Rs. 83.5 billion in

terms of assets at end 2021. The number of active

members of the fund was 241,384 at end 2021

when compared to 235,884 active members at

end 2020. Meanwhile, the investments of the

fund also grew by 16.4 per cent reaching Rs. 81

billion at end 2021. The PSPF has invested 57.4

per cent of its total investments in government

securities while other investments accounted for

42.6 per cent of the total investments as at end

2021. The net contribution was Rs. 835 million

during 2021 compared to the net contribution of

Rs. 507 million reported during the previous year.

The rate of return on member balances was 8

per cent in 2021 compared to 9.75 per cent in

2020.

Approved Pension and Provident Funds

(APPFs) accounted for 5.4 per cent of the

superannuation sector by end 2021. The

number of members covered by APPFs was

estimated to be 76,692 and total assets of the

funds were estimated to be Rs. 207.6 billion at

end 2021.

Liquidity in the domestic money market,

which persistently remained at a surplus level

during 2020 and the first half of 2021, declined

considerably from mid-July 2021 and turned

negative from end August 2021. The substantial

surplus liquidity during the first half of 2021 was

mainly due to purchases of Treasury bills at the

primary market and foreign exchange related

transactions by the Central Bank. However, surplus

liquidity in the domestic money market declined

thereafter, mainly due to foreign loan repayments

by the Government, currency withdrawals by LCBs,

maturities of Treasury bills held by the Central

Bank, and maturing of foreign currency buy-sell

swap transactions of the Central Bank with LCBs.

With the reversal of the accommodative monetary

policy stance in mid-August 2021 and the increase

of the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) by 2.00

percentage points to 4.00 per cent with effect from

the reserve maintenance period commencing 01

September 2021, liquidity of the domestic money

market declined significantly. Accordingly, market

liquidity, which remained at a surplus of Rs. 206.8

billion by end 2020, recorded a deficit of Rs. 119.6

billion by end September 2021. As guided by the

monetary policy stance, a deficit was maintained in

the overnight money market liquidity through open

market operations by conducting repo auctions

since late August 2021. Moreover, the Central

Bank conducted auctions of outright sales of

Treasury bills in November and December 2021,

in order to mop up excess liquidity on a permanent

basis, resulting mainly from primary purchases of

Treasury bills by the Central Bank and special

allocations of Treasury bills to the Central Bank,

thereby curbing any downward pressure on the

Average Weighted Call Money Rate (AWCMR).

Meanwhile, the Central Bank conducted term

reverse repo auctions, on two occasions, to ease

liquidity pressures experienced by certain banks,

towards the second half of 2021. However, by end

2021, domestic money market liquidity recorded a

deficit of Rs. 366.2 billion.

Money Market Interest Rates

AWCMR, which is the operating target of the

monetary policy framework, moved gradually

towards the upper bound of the Standing

Rate Corridor (SRC) with the tightening of

money market liquidity conditions since 2021,

alongside the upward adjustment of policy

interest rates in August 2021. Since mid-July

2021, AWCMR remained above the middle of

the SRC in line with the declining money market

liquidity. Accordingly, other short term money

market rates also showed an upward adjustment

from July 2021 onwards. Increased borrowings

by certain banks, liquidity concentration among a

a certain extent. The depreciation pressure was

largely abated by the significant supply of foreign

exchange liquidity, through substantial outright

interventions along with a series of bilateral

sell-buy foreign exchange swap transactions,

to facilitate essential import bills by the Central

Bank. Since early September 2021, following the

Central Bank’s instructions to all banks to execute

FX transactions within the USD/LKR exchange

rate between Rs. 200 - Rs. 203, the average

spot exchange rate in the domestic interbank

FX market hovered within the specified range.

Meanwhile, a number of incentive schemes were

introduced in line with the policy directions taken

by the Government and the Central Bank to foster

foreign exchange conversions while attracting

more foreign exchange inflows to the country. In

line with the overall depreciation of Sri Lankan

rupee against the US dollar, the average US dollar

buying and selling exchange rates of commercial

banks for telegraphic transfers as of end 2021 were

at Rs. 198.50 and Rs. 203.00, whilst comparative

figures in end 2020 were at Rs. 184.12 and

Rs. 189.18, respectively. Meanwhile, during the

year 2021, the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated

against the sterling pound, the Indian rupee and

the Australian dollar.

The Central Bank was a net seller in the

domestic forex market in 2021. Despite the

modest purchases of foreign exchange from

banks, mainly under the requirement imposed

on banks to sell a certain percentage of foreign

exchange to the Central Bank of converted

workers’ remittances and to mandatorily convert

export proceeds to build up the gross official

reserve position, the Central Bank significantly

supplied foreign exchange to the market to

facilitate essential imports. This supply of foreign

exchange by the Central Bank helped address

the foreign exchange liquidity shortage in the

domestic foreign exchange market to a limited

few foreign banks as well as the exposure limits

applicable for money market transactions among

market participants contributed to the increase in

domestic money market interest rates. Further,

with the upward adjustment in policy interest rates

by 50 basis points on 19 August 2021, AWCMR

increased further and remained at 5.94 per cent

at end September 2021. However, by end 2021,

AWCMR broadly stabilised closer to the upper

bound of the SRC. The Average Weighted Repo

Rate (AWRR) also moved in line with AWCMR

during this period. As at end 2021, AWCMR and

AWRR stood at 5.95 per cent and 5.98 per cent,

respectively.

Domestic Foreign Exchange Market

During 2021, the Sri Lanka rupee depreciated

against the US dollar by 7 per cent from

Rs. 186.41 as at end 2020 to Rs. 200.43 as at

end 2021. The exchange rate, which levelled

off around Rs. 186 at the beginning of the year,

came under pressure during the first quarter

of the year with the elevated demand in the

foreign exchange market mainly due to high

import volumes and continuous external debt

service payment requirements despite the limited

supply caused by the effects of the COVID-19

pandemic such as the delay in the revival of

tourism industry, comparatively low remittances

and restricted access to international capital

markets amidst consecutive sovereign rating

downgrades. The persistent liquidity shortage in

the domestic forex market was further aggravated

by lower exporter conversions and divergence

of workers’ remittances into informal channels

with the emergence of shadow foreign exchange

markets. Since the end of April 2021, banks

mutually agreed to execute FX transactions within

the USD/LKR exchange rate band of Rs. 200 -

Rs. 203, in order to curb the depreciation pressure

and market speculation on the exchange rate to

extent. Accordingly, the Central Bank absorbed

US dollars 506 million and supplied US dollars

1,253 million, resulting in a net sale of US dollars

747 million in 2021.

Moreover, with the objective of attracting

more FX inflows to the country and thereby to

improve the liquidity in the domestic FX market,

the Government together with the Central

Bank, offered several incentives for workers’

remittances channelled through the formal

banking sector. The public were also incentivised

with a number of temporary measures, including

an additional Rs. 10 per US dollar, when converting

their foreign currency notes into Sri Lanka rupees.

In 2021, the total volume of inter-bank

foreign exchange transactions amounted to US

dollars 12.2 billion, compared to US dollars 18.4

billion in 2020. Accordingly, trading volumes in

the domestic foreign exchange inter-bank market

declined by 33.9 per cent compared to that of

2020. In line with this development, the average

daily volumes in the inter-bank foreign exchange

market declined to US dollars 50 million in 2021

from US dollars 77 million in 2020.

Government Securities Market

The yield curve of government securities

increased and settled at higher levels towards the

latter part of 2021. The yield rates of government

securities adjusted upward in response to the

monetary policy actions in August 2021 with a

50 basis point increase in the policy rates and

a 200 basis point increase in the SRR. Another

round of upward adjustments in yield rates was

observed with the removal of the announcement

of maximum acceptance yield rates in September

2021, coupled with negative sovereign rating

actions and increased government borrowings

amid allocations of unsubscribed Treasury bills to

the Central Bank.

At the primary auctions of Treasury bills, the

market preference was towards 91-day maturity,

particularly towards the latter part of the year.

On the contrary, the longer tenure Treasury bonds

were preferred by investors in general at the primary

auctions. The short term 91-day Treasury bill yield

rates remained broadly stable towards the end of

2021 at 8.16 per cent while benchmark 182-day

and 364-day remained at 8.33 per cent and 8.24

per cent, respectively. However, 91-day, 182-day

and 364-day Treasury bill yield rates increased

by 314, 334 and 324 basis points respectively

as at end 2021 from end 2020. The yield rates of

Treasury bonds also increased noticeably during

2021. In aggregate, Treasury bonds amounting to

Rs. 1,762 billion with a Weighted Average Yield

Rate (WAYR) of 8.70 per cent were issued in

2021 compared to Rs. 1,332.1 billion with a

WAYR of 7.39 per cent in 2020. Moreover,

Treasury bills amounting to Rs 3,821.4 billion

were issued in 2021 with an overall WAYR of 6.09

per cent compared to Rs. 2,590.5 billion issued

with an overall WAYR of 5.82 per cent in 2020.2

Access to international capital markets

remained restrictive compounded by multiple

negative sovereign ratings, prohibitive

secondary market yield levels for Sri Lanka’s

ISBs, and continued uncertainties emanating

from the COVID-19 pandemic. The ISB which

matured in July 2021 was settled without resorting

to new ISB issuance in line with the intention

of gradually reducing of external liabilities,

especially high cost commercial borrowings. In

the domestic foreign currency financing front,

SLDBs amounting to US dollars 1,041.3 million

were raised in 2021, which is marginally lower

per cent, respectively.

With active domestic investor participation

and some timely initiatives carried out by

both the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

such as digitisation, the daily turnover and

capital raising improved during 2021. During

2021, there were 13 new equity Initial Public

Developing and implementing a National

Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) for Sri Lanka

was identified during the recent past as a key

focus area of the country in order to achieve the

Sustainable Development Goals. The Central

Bank successfully launched the NFIS of Sri Lanka

in March 2021 and several actions were taken to

operationalise the implementation of the NFIS to

identify and promote financial inclusion across the

country. In recognition of the need for improving

financial education as a priority action across all

policy pillars of the NFIS, an island wide financial

literacy survey was successfully completed

in 2021, and the modules and educational

materials are being developed by the Ministry of

Education in collaboration with the Central Bank

and other relevant stakeholders to incorporate

financial education into the school curriculum as

a compulsory subject starting from Grade 6 to 11.

Financial literacy is one of the main pillars

identified under the NFIS and a main role has

to be played by the Regional Development

Department (RDD) of the Central Bank in order

to enhance financial literacy of the country’s

people. With the objective of enhancing financial

literacy throughout the country, RDD initiated

several programmes during the year with the

support of 6 Regional Offices of the Central

Bank. Accordingly, 08 Training of Trainers (TOT)

discussions, 17 Radio and TV programmes, 07

knowledge sharing programmes and more than

330 financial literacy, entrepreneurship and skill

development programmes were conducted in

2021. Amidst the constraints associated with

widespread uncertainties of the COVID-19

pandemic, several programmes were carried

out as online programmes utilising the newly

developed online oriented training and awareness

materials.

a range of credit supplementary services during

2021. Total loans released during 2021 was

Rs. 27,268 million among 80,899 beneficiaries

through Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs)

under 14 refinance loan schemes and 6 interest

subsidy and credit guarantee schemes of which

58 per cent accounted for refinance schemes and

42 per cent accounted for interest subsidy and

credit guarantee schemes.

Extraordinary measures were taken by

the Central Bank to cope with the COVID-19

Pandemic. The Central Bank continued to

implement several extraordinary policy measures

throughout the year providing concessions

to businesses and individuals affected by the

pandemic. Accordingly, moratoria were offered for

the concessionary credit schemes implemented

by the Central Bank viz extending the repayment

period up to 36 months from 24 months and grace

period until 30 September 2021 and subsequently

extended until 31 December 2021. Further, the

tourism sector was facilitated with extraordinary

measures by extending the grace period for loans

until 30 June 2022. The Central Bank continued

to support MSMEs by providing moratoria and

implemented several credit schemes. With the

intention of establishing market driven value

chain financing in the country, the Central Bank

implemented a Domestic Agriculture Development

programme (DAD-PP) as a pilot project to identify

gaps and opportunities to develop a comprehensive

value chain programme for the agriculture sector

in Sri Lanka. Further, Operating Instructions

were issued to introduce and implement a credit

guarantee and interest subsidy scheme for MSME

rice mill owners and intensification of shrimp

farms in Sri Lanka. A credit guarantee and interest

subsidy scheme to enhance the dairy farming and

developing MSMEs were initiated in 2021.

Introduction

Financial inclusion can be broadly defined as the state, where individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs – transactions, payments, savings, credit and insurance – delivered in a responsible and sustainable way.1 Financial inclusion is also identified as inclusive finance, since it strives to remove barriers for individuals and businesses to participate in the formal financial sector and to use financial services to improve their sources of income and standards of living.

The concept of financial inclusion has become a central part of global policy agenda since early 2000. Many countries use financial inclusion as an effort to promote a level playing field for individuals and businesses to work towards elevating themselves out of poverty and contribute to sustainable economic growth. Increasing access to financial services and products for those who are excluded from the financial sector enables them to plan and better manage their finances, while opening up opportunities for better standards of living. Access to finance for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) encourages them to invest in new and more productive business activities, contributing to economic growth while generating employment opportunities. Although, financial inclusion alone cannot elevate people out of poverty, it helps to promote building better lives. Further, the importance of financial inclusion is now widely recognized in building a strong foundation of a country’s financial stability, which in turn will facilitate inclusive economic development. In this regard, upgrading financial inclusion concepts and efforts to the policy platforms requires assessment and quantification of level of financial inclusion and careful scrutinisation of the actual requirements of the economy and the individuals.

In this backdrop, assessment of the level of financial inclusion in Sri Lanka has been carried out by the Sri Lankan policy makers with the intention to set targets at national level and to monitor the progress of the financial inclusion initiatives under three dimensions:

BOX 10National Financial Inclusion Strategy of Sri Lanka: “Better Quality Inclusion for Better Lives”

“Access” dimension reflects the depth of outreach of financial services, i.e. penetration of bank branches, ATMs or Point of Sale (POS) devices, or demand-side barriers faced by customers to access financial institutions, such as cost or information. “Usage” dimension reflects how customers use financial services, such as the frequency and duration of the financial product/service over time. “Quality” of the products and the service delivery describe the availability of choices to meet the needs of the customer, as well as aspects of financial consumer protection and the degree of the awareness and understanding of financial products and services.2

Where does Sri Lanka Stand on Financial Inclusion?

Sri Lanka’s long-standing efforts to increase financial inclusion date back to the early 20th century. As a result of these efforts, Sri Lanka has made significant advancements in financial inclusion. According to the National Financial Inclusion Survey conducted by CBSL, supported by International Finance Corporation (IFC), World Bank Group, in 2018, account ownership in Sri Lanka stands at 88 per cent, which is higher than the South Asia average.3 Noticeably, it has been reported of having no gender disparity or any significant difference in account ownership among less advantaged segments of the population, including rural residents, or low-income people. Sri Lanka also enjoys high level of bank branch penetration, with bank branch density of 16.4 branches per 100,000 adults as of December 2021.4 However, in contrast to the high literacy level (92.9%5) among the Sri Lankans, the low level of financial literacy (35%6) has been recognized among certain pockets as an impediment to the universal achievements.

More broadly, despite high levels of access, usage of accounts and uptake of other financial products and services such as mobile money, insurance, retirement schemes and bond and equity instruments are modest. More importantly, access to appropriate credit products from formal providers remains a significant barrier for both individuals and MSMEs.7 Although, urban and industry MSMEs get better access to formal financial sources, small scale village based MSMEs are often denied of access to financial facilities in Sri Lanka. As a result, vulnerable groups have been forced to resort

The NFIS clearly defines a set of specific policy objectives that are centered around four key policy pillars.

I. Digital Finance and Payments, II. Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Finance, III. Consumer Protection and IV. Financial Literacy and Capacity Building.

A set of core enablers has also been identified to support achieving progress in these focus areas, namely; Data, Infrastructure and Policy Tools and Enabling Regulatory Environment.

The Framework of the NFIS

By assessing the current state of financial inclusion and identifying obstacles and opportunities relevant to each pillar, necessary policy initiatives have been identified and the Action Plan of the NFIS has been formulated accordingly to achieve higher level of financial inclusion. The Action plan comprises a set of sequenced and time-bound actions with clear indication of institutional level responsibilities.

In operationalising the NFIS of Sri Lanka, a governance structure comprising 04 levels of entities has been established. The National Council at the top level is to provide overall policy guidance relevant to implementation of the NFIS with the Management Committee entrusted to oversee the day-to-day implementation of the NFIS and to provide regular updates to the National Council. Meanwhile, Working Groups under each policy pillar are to serve as consultation forums with the NFIS Secretariat established at the CBSL to ensure coordination and monitoring across different implementing entities to

to the informal sector, thereby exposing them to higher risks, difficulties due to financial malpractices and make them more vulnerable to poverty. The potential for further growth in usage of digital payments and other Digital Financial Services has been highlighted by the National Financial Inclusion Survey 2018. However, the nation has failed in reaping maximum possible benefits to a sustainable extent, due to lack of financial skills and capability to make use of available financial products and services. Lack of an effective regulatory authority and legal protection for affected groups have been the major factors that have contributed to the financial exclusion practices observed in Sri Lanka.

In this context, the formulation of the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) of Sri Lanka is considered as a timely initiative, bringing together all key stakeholders for the first time to carry out a long-term, comprehensive and coordinated strategy for achieving financial inclusion in Sri Lanka. The development of the NFIS has been led by the CBSL with the collaboration of all stakeholders, including government institutions, formal financial service providers and other relevant professional bodies. The NFIS was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in March 2020 and launched in March 2021 by the CBSL and currently in operation in collaboration with more than 20 implementing entities.

NFIS Policy Framework and Implementation

The aim of the NFIS is to provide a long-term, comprehensive, standardised and well-coordinated approach for all stakeholders to move towards improving the financial inclusiveness of the country.

The vision of the NFIS of Sri Lanka provides the strategic direction for the priorities of the Strategy, that reflects the aspirational, long-term goal that stakeholders of the NFIS seek to collaboratively achieve.

"Better quality inclusion for better lives"

All individuals and enterprises in Sri Lanka have well-informed, fair and equitable access to a range of high-quality, appropriate, secure and affordable financial products and services that they can use to contribute to economic growth and improve their standard of living.

The vision incorporates important concepts beyond simple “access” to financial services, where prevalence of enabling environment for well-informed consumers to select and use financial products and services appropriately. The NFIS focuses on ensuring expanded access to high-quality financial products that are appropriately designed, affordable and delivered through formal financial sector.

Sri Lanka’s country definition of financial inclusion is aligned with the vision of the NFIS, which recognised financial inclusion is not as a stand-alone goal, yet lead to positive economic and social impact to the community.

secure achieving NFIS targets within the intended time frame.

NFIS Governance Structure

The National Results Framework of NFIS under the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system explicitly articulates the expected outcomes throughout the process with the key objectives of financial inclusion translated into measurable indicators. Encompassing all policy areas, the need of improving financial education has been highlighted as a priority action in the overall process. Prioritising the actions introduced under the policy areas of financial literacy and capacity building, respective stakeholders are actively collaborated in implementing the actions. As a timely and an effective policy tool to ensure financial inclusion among future generations, the Ministry of Education has undertaken several measures along with relevant stakeholders in order to incorporate the financial education into school curriculum as a compulsory element from grade 6 to 11.

In order to standardise the adult’s financial education programmes, education modules on financial literacy and digital literacy were developed and Training of Trainers (TOT) programs are being rolled out. Further, an island wide financial literacy survey was conducted in 2021 to assess the level of financial literacy of the country. The data collected through the survey will be used to assess the level of financial literacy among Sri Lankans. The survey has been designed according to standard financial literacy score system recognized internationally under three key elements of financial knowledge, financial behavior and financial attitudes. Considering the importance of moving towards a single direction, a coordination mechanism is being developed to improve synergies across all the stakeholder entities conducting financial literacy programmes and MSME support programmes. Going beyond, the proposed Financial Literacy and Capacity Building Road Map will set out the strategic direction and principles for development and implementation of financial education and MSME support programmes.

How NFIS will support achieving the financial inclusion goals in Sri Lanka ?

The strategy is not limited to improving the overall national financial inclusion level, but also is aimed at reducing disparities in levels of financial inclusion combined with social and demographic attributes such as income, geographical location, age, gender etc., by the conclusion of the NFIS.

It is expected to increase access to financial products and services that help unserved and underserved segments to improve their financial resilience. Further, with the increased access to finance, MSMEs will grow and become more productive towards generating income and creating more formal employment opportunities.

In parallel, with well-designed, coordinated and comprehensive financial literacy initiatives will broader the right financial knowledge, skills and behavior of financial consumers and will ensure the ability of future Sri Lankans to meet their basic financial needs. More financially capable and empowered consumers will eventually promote good market conduct and improve financial services, resulting in a virtuous cycle for financial inclusion. Through the NFIS, consumer protection will also be reinforced by having appropriate regulatory environment to strengthen the market conduct of all types of financial service providers. The best practices to be established for well-being of customers, while increasing trust of consumers facilitating the broader objective of financial system stability.

The significant improvements in the digital finance ecosystem on the other hand, will be a boon for financial inclusion, as they facilitate significant cost efficiencies and viable delivery of financial services to the low-income individuals and small enterprises of the society complemented by a more conducive regulatory environment and necessary digital infrastructure, enabling market players to deliver more innovative financial services.

8.6 Financial Infrastructure

Payment and Settlement Systems

Amidst several waves of the COVID-19

pandemic during 2021, the Central Bank

continued to facilitate economic activities

by ensuring uninterrupted payment and

settlement services in the country. The Central

Bank continued to regulate and supervise the

payment and settlement systems in the country to

facilitate an efficient and secure national payment

infrastructure.

The LankaSettle System, which consists

of the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)

System, and the LankaSecure System operated

smoothly to accommodate the increasing

transaction volumes during the period under

review. The value of RTGS transactions recorded

a significant increase of 96.3 percent during 2021.

In value terms, the share of RTGS transactions

in total non-cash payments accounted for 94

per cent during the period under review. The

Central Bank continued to provide the interest

free Intra-day Liquidity Facility (ILF) against

the collateral of government securities to the

Participating Institutions (PI) of the RTGS System

to avoid any disruptions that could arise due to any

liquidity issues of PIs. During 2021, the Central

Bank released a daily average value of Rs. 208.5

billion per business day to PIs who requested the

ILF.

The aggregate of Scripless Securities

held in LankaSecure as at end 2021 was

Rs. 9,238.6 billion (Face Value) which comprised

of Treasury bills and Treasury bonds worth

Rs. 2,270.7 billion and Rs. 6,967.9 billion,

respectively. LankaSecure facilitated transactions3

amounting to Rs. 262.8 trillion during 2021.

3 The LankaSecure system settles all government securities related transactions including transactions of primary issuances, secondary market trades (outright, repurchase trans-actions, pledge transactions), Open Market Operations, and Intra-Day Liquidity Facility.

During 2021, the Cheque Clearing System

of the country operated by LankaClear (Pvt.)

Ltd (LCPL) cleared a total volume of 33 million

cheques amounting to Rs. 8,311.5 billion. Even

though the volume of cheques cleared by LCPL

demonstrates a marginal decrease of 1.8 per cent,

the value of the cheques recorded a 11 per cent

growth compared to the previous year.

The Sri Lanka Interbank Payment System

(SLIPS), which is operated by LCPL, mainly

facilitates low value retail bulk payments, and

recorded a growth in terms of both the volume

and value of payments by 13.7 per cent and

26.8 per cent to 41.9 million and Rs. 2,862.2

billion, respectively, during 2021.

Common ATM Switch (CAS), the first

phase of Common Card and Payment Switch

(CCAPS), enables cash withdrawals and

balance inquiries from any Automated Teller

Machine (ATM) connected to the CAS network.

The transaction volume of CAS increased by 18.8

per cent to 58.2 million, while the value of CAS

transactions increased by 32.4 per cent to Rs. 671

billion, respectively, during the period under review.

As at end 2021, 29 financial institutions were

integrated to the CAS network. Shared ATM Switch,

which was launched in 2015 to provide services to

financial institutions, which do not have the capacity

to operate their own card management system, had

two members and continued its operations smoothly

during the review period.

Common Electronic Fund Transfer Switch

(CEFTS), which was launched in 2015, facilitates

retail fund transfers among member institutions

on a real time basis. The volume of CEFTS

transactions demonstrated a significant growth of

97.8 per cent from 27.6 million to 54.7 million, while

the CEFTS transaction value increased by 104

per cent to Rs. 4,926.6 billion from Rs. 2,415.3 billion

during 2021. This was mainly due to the promotional

by 625.4 per cent to 1,154,984 and 361.3

per cent to Rs. 2,487 million, respectively, with

126,670 joining as new LANKAQR merchants.

With the aim of popularising LANKAQR payments

among small and medium merchants as well as

consumers, the “LANKAQR Nationwide Rollout

Campaign” was launched in October 2021.

Further, the maximum Merchant Discount Rate of

0.5 per cent for LANKAQR initiated transactions

was extended until further notice to encourage

merchants to accept LANKAQR as a payment

mode.

The Central Bank continued its regulatory

and supervisory activities with regard

to payment cards and mobile payment

systems, in terms of the provisions of the

Payment Cards and Mobile Payment Systems

Regulations No. 1 of 2013. Accordingly, two

financial institutions were licensed to function as

issuers of debit cards as per the Regulations. Due

to the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic and

the Government imposing travel restrictions, virtual

onsite supervision was carried out with respect to a

service provider of mobile payment systems while

off-site supervision was strengthened to continue

to monitor compliance with the regulations imposed

on service providers of payment cards and mobile

payment systems to ensure smooth functioning of

licensed service providers.

The Central Bank successfully concluded

the deployment and testing of the Proof of

Concept (POC) for the Blockchain Technology

based shared Know Your Customer (KYC)

facility. This indicated the potential of Blockchain

Technology to enable innovations in the financial

sector in Sri Lanka.

The National Payments Council (NPC), the

industry consultative and monitoring committee

on payment and settlement systems continued

to monitor the Payment System Road Map for

campaigns conducted continuously by the Central

Bank and financial institutions to promote digital

payment methods and consumers switching to

digital payment methods since the Government

reimposed travel restrictions due to the COVID-19

pandemic.

EPF, Import and Export Control Department,

Sri Lanka Standard Institution and the

Department of Inland Revenue also joined the

LankaPay Online Payment Platform (LPOPP),

which was launched in order to facilitate

online payments to government institutions

via CEFTS during the period under review. The

LPOPP transaction volume significantly increased

by 433.9 per cent, from 96,258 transactions to

513,961 transactions, while the LPOPP transaction

value grew from Rs. 75.3 billion to Rs. 198.2 billion

by 163.1 per cent during the period under review.

The increase in the volume and value of LPOPP

transactions was largely due to the increase in

transactions related to the Sri Lanka Customs and

the Department of Inland Revenue joining LPOPP

during the review period.

During 2021, a substantial growth was

observed in LANKAQR based transactions

with total volume and value which increased

Introduction

Banking has had a close relationship with technology for decades, from computerised banking systems to automated teller machines (ATM) to internet banking systems. Adoption of technology has enabled banks to continuously increase efficiencies, lower intermediation cost, and increase profitability. The intensive use of technology by banks to increase profitability has attracted the attention of the technology investors and has created new business avenues, giving rise to the modern day’s FinTech industry.

FinTech or Financial technology as it is more formally known, has grown rapidly during the last decade and is now posing challenges to both traditional banking business models as well as traditional banking supervisory methodologies.

In addition to increased efficiencies, products and services enabled by FinTech also offer opportunities for unbanked and underbanked population, who may have limited or no access to banks, to receive traditional financial services through non-traditional channels. This is mainly due to the use of smart mobile phones as a primary channel to deliver FinTech based banking services and relatively high mobile phone penetration even among the underprivileged segments of population. Accordingly, it is evident that FinTech provides opportunities for more competition, increased efficiency, and reduced intermediation cost in banking business. However, complacency on the part of traditional banks will see them rapidly losing business to emerging FinTech driven companies as a result of flight to efficiency by banking customers.

The rapid emergence of FinTech has given rise to potential new risks relating to technology, data governance, and market conduct. This poses the need for a supervisory approach that supports fintech adoption by the banking industry. Such an approach needs to address relevant risks to protect consumers while fostering innovation and competition.

Fintech innovations that will impact traditional banking

Even though there are many FinTech innovations, some will significantly impact the traditional banking channel. Virtual banking, open banking, peer-to-peer lending, and digital currencies are four such FinTech innovations that have the potential to materially change the way traditional banking is conducted. These are explained in detail below:

Virtual banking

A bank that offers its services entirely through electronic channels without requiring physical interaction with

BOX 11The FinTech Invasion: Way forward for Banking Supervisors

customers is considered a virtual bank. This will provide significant cost savings due to reduced need for physical locations and staff. Both existing and newer banks are pursuing virtual banking due to the cost attractiveness. Customers of a virtual bank will be able to perform all banking activities from account opening to making deposits to borrowing funds via mobile application or through internet banking instead of visiting a bank branch. Virtual banking will also be one of the most convenient ways for traditional banks to successfully counter challenges emerging from FinTech driven banks and services offered by other FinTech businesses, due to the decision making and processing functions being similar for banking products offered through both traditional and virtual banking.

Open banking

Open banking allows consented third parties to access customer data in a bank using application programming interfaces (API). This enables third-party FinTech providers to present variety of solutions to consumers such as mobile applications that allow accessing banking data from different financial institutions and easily perform transactions using multiple banks. A bank that has enabled open banking will become significantly different from a traditional institution. Open banking puts customers in control of their data, which gives consumers the opportunity to take advantage of customized and precision designed financial services that their original bank could not offer initially. Accordingly, both individual customers and businesses will be able to manage their finances more efficiently with open banking. Even more importantly, open banking facilitate innovation in the FinTech industry, allowing new technologies to emerge and reengineer how financial services are offered by banks.

Peer-to-peer lending platforms

Peer-to-peer lending is probably the most direct challenge posed to the traditional banking model by emerging FinTech businesses. Peer-to-peer lending platforms intend to directly connect lenders and borrowers, thereby drastically reducing the cost of financial intermediation. The peer-to-peer lending platforms initially emerged as an alternative funding source for unbanked and underbanked customers who do not have access to bank lending. However, due to its cost efficiency peer-to-peer lending is now attracting usual customers of traditional banks as well. Even a medium scale migration of banking customers to peer-to-peer lending platforms will become a financial stability concern for banking supervisors, given that there are no prudential measures such as capital adequacy or liquidity requirements as well as safety net measures like deposit insurance for peer-to-peer lending activities.

Digital currencies

The emergence of digital currencies is probably the biggest FinTech driven challenge faced by traditional monetary and banking systems. Two types of digital currencies, cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), are likely to become significant as banking and financial transactions conducted by general public becomes more digital. Cryptocurrency is a digital asset that is secured by cryptography and operates using blockchain technology, which is a distributed ledger that utilizes a large decentralized network of computers. Cryptocurrencies are not issued by any central authority such as a Central Bank. This also make cryptocurrencies less affected by government interventions and thereby possibly impacting the effectiveness of central bank monetary policy. On the other hand, CBDCs that will be issued by a country’s monetary authority will act as a digital token of the country's official currency. As CBDCs are issued by a country’s monetary authority they are fully backed by the issuing government and will be under the full policy control of the issuing monetary authority.

What should be the regulatory and supervisory approach towards FinTech

The need to adopt an open yet cautious regulatory approach when facilitating banks’ adoption of FinTech

The rapid rise of FinTech raises questions to banking supervisors, such as the need to expand the supervisory limits to include new risks; whether existing regulations are adequate for newer types of digital financial services; and how to identify, monitor and mitigate the risks faced by banks due to FinTech innovations and exposures to FinTech businesses.

Further, FinTech driven products and services are heavily reliant on range of information systems and data connected to the internet. Therefore, technology, cybersecurity and data protection related risks associated with FinTech needs to be well understood and prudently managed.

However, it should be noted that excessive regulation and supervision may deter innovation and could place banks at a competitive disadvantage while also discouraging consumers. Therefore, banking supervisors need to carefully assess risks and benefits and avoid hindering required innovation.

There are two extremes in the supervisory approaches that could be taken by banking supervisors when it comes to the supervision of FinTech products and services. The first is the “laissez faire” approach, where innovation is permitted without any supervisory intervention up to the point where serious risks to the banking system emerge. The other extreme approach is to limit innovation only to products and services desired by the supervisors by enforcing regulations that limit innovation.

The need for supervisors to move on with Supervisory Technology (SupTech)

It is the responsibility of the banking supervisors to keep the banking system stable while utilizing the benefits of FinTech for the betterment of both the consumers and the banks. The current supervisory policies, techniques, and resources, that are designed to address risks posed by traditional banking channels, could be inadequate to address the risks introduced by FinTech. Further, the amount of resources of a banking supervisor is limited. Therefore, the adoption of supervisory practices that enable effective supervision, with the use of limited resources and a focus on risk and stability of financial institutions has become imperative.

These factors have required bank supervisors developing and implementing new technology based supervisory approaches, broadly referred to as Supervisory Technology or SupTech. The adoption of SupTech by banking supervisors will have a deep impact on how banks are supervised.

Essential SupTech capabilities for banking supervisors

Sophisticated supervisory information systems, advanced data analytic capabilities, and use of artificial intelligence to extract knowledge from relevant unstructured data sources are some of the key SupTech capabilities required for any modern banking supervisor. These are detailed below:

Supervisory information systems

A supervisory information system is an information system that facilitate collection, validation, and analytics of information reported by banks and other financial institutions. The features of such includes functionality for banks to submit data or for the supervisor to retrieve data; a data warehouse with facilities to store, manage, and secure documents and data; smaller databases or datamarts to enable data querying and analysis by different teams within the banking supervisor; and data analytics and business intelligence tools that enable generation of supervisory insights.

Advanced data analytics capabilities to generate accurate and timely early warning signals

Banking supervisors will benefit immensely by implementing advanced data analytics capabilities together with a supervisory information system. This will include capabilities for querying, analysis, and visualization of data. An analytics platform will facilitate end-to-end computation of both standardized and ad hoc data analysis requirements of bank supervisors.

A comprehensive data analytics platform will enable generation of early warnings for different risk categories, banks, and clusters of banks through predictive analytic

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

2688

models using structured data submitted by banks, data insights from credit bureau and other external data repositories, and macroeconomic forecasts. Such a platform will also enable the banking supervisors to conduct periodic forward looking stress tests based on macroeconomic forecasts and institutional trends.

Use of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate supervisory insights from public and non-public unstructured data

Fully developed data analytics capabilities should enable banking supervisors to conduct analysis and interpretation of both structured and unstructured data using conventional statistical tools as well as emerging artificial intelligence-based technologies. Accordingly, use of artificial intelligence based technologies by banking supervisors to generate supervisory insights from public and non-public unstructured data will focus on extracting knowledge from various unstructured (text based) data sources to augment structured data based analytics and computations already conducted on the data analytics platform including bank ratings and early warning computations.

Initiatives already taken by CBSL

CBSL has taken multiple steps to facilitate FinTech as well as to address the key risks. Some of these initiatives are detailed below:

Regulatory framework on technology risk management and resilience

The CBSL in 2021 introduced regulatory framework on technology risk management and resilience as a set of minimum regulatory requirements for licensed banks. The key characteristics of the framework are the introduction of enhanced information security, system availability, and resilience requirements for critical information systems, enhanced information security requirements for sensitive data, and higher risk management measures for domestic systemically important banks.

The components of the regulatory framework include requirements relating to governance framework for technology risk management, information security, information system availability and disaster recovery, staff competencies, compliance with international standards, and use of third-party infrastructure including cloud computing.

Proof-of-concept (POC) on KYC data sharing

In 2021, CBSL also completed the process of developing and testing a Blockchain technology based shared Know-Your-Customer (KYC) Proof-of-Concept (POC) solution. The purpose of developing a Blockchain Technology based POC of an industry-wide Shared KYC process was to assess the potential to improve customer experience, lower operational costs and reduce the operational risk of banks and other financial institutions.

It is expected that digitalization of the KYC process, especially with user friendly and secure designs, would encourage customers to use digital financial services and increase their access to financial services.

The findings demonstrated several salient features of Blockchain Technology that enabled secure and efficient sharing of customer KYC information between banks. This was a pioneering national project initiated by the CBSL that drew the voluntary participation of the Banking Industry and the Information Technology Industry to collaboratively explore the potential of Blockchain Technology to enable innovations in many financial services.

Regulatory sandbox

In 2020, CBSL commenced operations of a FinTech Regulatory sandbox with the objective of encouraging and enabling FinTech initiatives that promote greater efficiency and increased access to financial products and services. The sandbox is intended to provide a safe space for selected innovators to test their products and services, without the risk of infringing on regulatory requirements.

Way Forward

In order to obtain the maximum economic benefits from FinTech while ensuring that it does not impact the financial system stability adversly, the financial sector regulators will need to adopt a two-fold approach. The financial regulators shall make necessary changes to the regulatory framework to ensure that the regulatory environment facilitates FinTech innovations appropriately, while risks posed by such innovations are adequately monitored and mitigated. Further, such FinTech enabling regulatory framework shall need to be continuously evolving to reflect the changes introduced by rapidly developing FinTech industry. On the other hand, the supervisory capacity of banking supervisors needs to be significantly enhanced by moving to more technology based and automated supervisory methodologies. These will include implementing modern supervisory information systems, developing advanced data analytics capabilities, and introducing artificial intelligence assisted supervisory technology (SupTech) tools. Such a supervisory environment will enable the banking supervisors to effectively supervise the banking system in a FinTech driven era.

Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism

The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the

Central Bank performed its key role of receiving,

analysing, and disseminating information on

suspicious financial transactions relating to

Money Laundering/Terrorist Financing (ML/TF)

or any other unlawful activity. During the year

2021, FIU received 4,696 Suspicious Transaction

Reports (STRs) and Information Requests from

Reporting Institutions (RIs), Law Enforcement

Agencies (LEAs), Regulatory Authorities (RAs) and

the general public. After conducting operational

and strategic analyses of the STRs received, 1,830

STRs were referred where necessary to relevant

LEAs and RAs for further investigation or regulatory

actions. In the period under review, 2,220 STRs

were kept under surveillance and 641 STRs were

kept for initial analysis and further studies, while

the remaining STRs were categorised as no further

action required. Further, in terms of Section 6 of

the Financial Transactions Reporting Act (FTRA)

No. 6 of 2006, FIU received 5.7 million (provisional)

Cash Transactions Reports (CTRs) and 9.2

million (provisional) Electronic Fund Transfers

(EFTs-inwards and outwards) exceeding the

reporting threshold of Rs. 1 million or its equivalent

in any foreign currency from RIs, during the year

2021.

FIU continued conducting risk based

Anti-Money Laundering/Terrorist Financing

(AML/CFT) supervision during the year in

order to ensure institutional compliance with

the AML/CFT legal framework of the country.

Risk based examinations were conducted in

Financial Institutions (FIs) as well as Designated

Non-Finance Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs)

in Sri Lanka. Despite certain difficulties faced in

conducting the planned onsite examinations due to

the pandemic situation, FIU successfully conducted

2 risk based onsite examinations, 7 joint risk based

onsite examinations and 7 spot examinations.

Further, 4 offsite follow-up examinations were

initiated to assess AML/CFT compliance of FIs.

Moreover, 5 thematic reviews were conducted

on FIs, and 2 thematic reviews were conducted

on DNFBPs to assess the sector wide AML/CFT

compliance. Based on the examinations conducted

in 2021, administrative penalties amounting to

Rs. 10.5 million were imposed on 4 LCBs and 5

LFCs on violations of Customer Due Diligence

(CDD) Rules in relation to the United Nations

sanctions screening, customer identification and

verification, Suspicious Transactions Reporting and

implementation of proper risk controls and mitigation

measures. In addition, 9 show cause letters and

5 warning letters were issued during the year to

FIs on non-compliance with the provisions of the

FTRA and CDD Rules, regulations and guidelines

issued thereunder. The AML/CFT supervision of

DNFBPs was further strengthened by implementing

continuous measures to enhance the number of

DNFBP institutions for AML/CFT compliance.

Several initiatives were taken to introduce

legislative amendments to the legal framework

on AML/CFT with the objective of improving

the effectiveness of the AML/CFT regime of the

country during the year 2021. Furthermore, FIU

initiated updating the National Risk Assessment

(NRA) on ML/TF with technical assistance from the

World Bank, in compliance with Recommendation 1 of

the Financial Action Task Force Recommendations.

The NRA working groups consist of 66 public and

private stakeholder agencies with more than 123

officials.

FIU initiated various steps to enhance

awareness among all stakeholders involved.

In order to strengthen the AML/ CFT supervision

process and institutional compliance, FIU issued

several guidelines and circulars and provided

resource assistance to 50 awareness/training

programmes during the year.

Legal Reforms Related to the Financial Sector

The Central Bank continued introducing

law reforms to major pieces of legislation

administered with the view of providing a

stronger legal foundation for the regulatory and

supervisory framework of the Central Bank. As

such, the Central Bank concluded the second round

of discussions pertaining to a new Banking Act in

2021 with the expectation of further strengthening

and streamlining the provisions of the Banking Act

on par with international standards. In addition, to

enhance regulatory and supervisory powers of the

Central Bank over the non-bank financial institutions

including the resolution authority of the Central Bank,

necessary amendments to the Finance Business

Act, No. 42 of 2011 were prepared by the Central

Bank.

The Central Bank also engaged in

developing new pieces of legislation, namely,

the Trading, Clearing and Netting Act, Financial

Assets Management Act and Microfinance and

Credit Regulatory Authority Act. The objective of

introducing a new Trading, Clearing and Netting Act

for Sri Lanka is to provide for enhanced regulations

on trading, clearing, netting, settlement, and

custody related to the transactions of government

securities and foreign exchange. This Act primarily

focuses on introducing a comprehensive legal and

technological infrastructure that may transform

the markets for government securities and

foreign exchange into safer, modern, competitive,

and fair marketplaces supported by modern

post-trade clearing, central counterparty systems,

multi-currency RTGS System, etc. The Financial

Assets Management Act was developed with

the aim of introducing a concept based legal

framework to establish financial asset management

companies in Sri Lanka with a view of easing the

burden of the balance sheets of regulated financial

institutions caused by underperforming assets.

The new Microfinance and Credit Regulatory

Authority Act was drafted in order to establish a

separate regulatory authority for the regulation

and supervision of business of money lending

and business of microfinance to ensure consumer

protection.

In addition, amendments were proposed

by the Central Bank to the Registered Stock

and Securities Ordinance, No. 07 of 1937

and subsidiary pieces of legislation issued

thereunder to strengthen the issuance

procedure of Treasury bonds and to improve

investor confidence in the government

securities market in Sri Lanka. Moreover,

amendments to the Foreign Exchange Act, No. 12

of 2017 were proposed with a view of facilitating the

smooth functioning of the foreign exchange market

and strengthening the regulatory powers.

The Central Bank contributed to review

legislation that is relevant to the Central Bank

and the financial sector drafted by several

other stakeholders, such as the Colombo Port

City Economic Commission Bill, Coronavirus

Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Temporary

Provisions) Bill, Finance Bill, Data Protection

Bill, National Savings Bank Act, and the Bank

of Ceylon Ordinance. During such reviews,

the Central Bank assessed the impact of said

enactments/amendments to the existing regulatory

and supervisory framework of the Central Bank

given the national importance embedded therein. In

order to maintain the resilience of public confidence

towards the financial system, the Central Bank

continued litigation related to unauthorised finance

companies, prohibited schemes and other issues

in the financial sector, with the assistance of the

Attorney General’s Department and other Law

Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) under the provisions

of the Finance Business Act, No.42 of 2011 and the

Banking Act, No. 30 of 1988.

Financial Consumer Protection

The financial consumer protection

framework aims to protect the interests of

financial consumers and promote fairness

and transparency for consumers of financial

products and services. New initiatives were

taken by the Central Bank in streamlining the

processing of complaints and requests, introducing

suitable legal provisions to facilitate financial

consumer protection framework either through

new legislations or by making amendments to

existing legislations and conducting examinations/

investigations on specific complaints. These

measures will empower authorities to take prompt

actions on financial consumer protection related

issues. The Financial Consumer Relations

Department (FCRD) of the Central Bank received

6,186 complaints and requests during 2021, with

an average of around 500 complaints per month.

Out of the complaints that require action, more

than 91 per cent were attended and approximately

45.7 per cent of the total complaints were settled

succeesfully. It is observed that most of the

complaints were from COVID-19 affected small

and medium scale businesses and individuals with

respect to moratoria, rescheduling of loans, high

interest rates, unacceptable/unethical practices,

and early settlement of credit facilities. In 2021, the

FCRD of the Central Bank introduced a simplified

Complaint Submission Form (CSF), improving the

efficiency of the complaint handling process.

Resolution and Enforcement Action on Weak Financial Institutions

The Central Bank continued to manage Sri

Lanka Deposit Insurance and Liquidity Support

Scheme (SLDILSS). In addition to the regulations

issued to increase the maximum compensation

payable amount from Rs. 600,000 to Rs. 1,100,000,

a new regulation, viz Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance

Liquidity Support Scheme Regulations No. 02 of

2021, was issued repealing and replacing previous

regulations of SLDILSS to improve operations and

management of SLDILSS in line with international

best practices. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic,

the Central Bank ensured the smooth functioning

of compensation payments to insured depositors

of the license cancelled/suspended finance

companies, namely, Central Investments and

Finance PLC (CIFL), The Standard Credit Finance

Ltd. (TSCFL), TKS Finance Ltd. (TKSFL), The

Finance Company PLC (TFC), ETI Finance Ltd

(ETIFL) and Swarnamahal Financial Services

PLC (SFSP) during the corresponding period.

The Central Bank paid compensation through

SLDILSS to 70,832 depositors amounting to

Rs. 29,251.46 million in relation to the above six (06)

companies, as at 31 December 2021 by following

an internally developed payment mechanism and

under the Agency Banking Agreement with the

People’s Bank. The loan outstanding (capital) of

one member institution, given under the liquidity

support facility as at 31 December 2021 was

Rs. 1.4 billion.

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

The Central Bank conducted several

investigations on prohibited schemes under

the relevant provisions of the Banking Act

No. 30 of 1988 upon receiving complaints from

the general public. Further, several awareness

programmes were conducted island wide with a view

of improving the financial literacy of different segments

of the general public to educate them on the ill effects

of joining prohibited schemes. The Central Bank is

in the process of formulating a resolution framework

for licenced banks and licenced finance companies

within the existing regulator framework.

Regulation and Supervision of Foreign Exchange

The Central Bank continued to regulate and

supervise foreign exchange transactions during

the year, amidst the challenges faced due to the

pandemic. Several policy measures were introduced

under the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Act

No. 12 of 2017 (FEA) with a view to preserving

foreign currency reserves and improving liquidity in

the domestic foreign exchange market.

A revised set of Regulations, Orders and

Directions were issued under the FEA with

effect from 22 March 2021 replacing the

previously issued Regulations, Orders and

Directions in order to address practical issues

and concerns of Authorised Dealers (ADs)

and other stakeholders, with the purpose of

achieving greater efficiency in the domestic

foreign exchange market. Further, considering

liquidity issues in the domestic foreign exchange

market, certain outward remittances in respect

of capital transactions were limited by an Order

issued by the Minister of Finance under Section 22

of the FEA. Opening of Special Deposit Accounts

(SDAs), which was introduced in the year 2020, was

extended for another one year period from 08 April

2021 considering its positive impact on the country

in terms of the increase in inward remittances.

Moreover, Directions were issued facilitating

resident companies to receive proceeds for equity

in foreign currency from non-resident investors,

while also enabling them to utilise such proceeds for

current transactions, without converting them into

Sri Lanka rupees. Further, in order to attract more

inward remittances, companies incorporated in

Sri Lanka were permitted to purchase ISBs issued

by the Government of Sri Lanka from the secondary

market, out of the externally borrowed funds.

In an effort to attract foreign currency

in the hands of residents into the formal

channels, an Order under Section 4 of the

FEA was issued by the Minister of Finance

permitting hotels registered with the Sri Lanka

Tourism Development Authority to accept

foreign currency from persons resident in

Sri Lanka who have foreign currency in their

possession. Additionally, to improve the liquidity

of the domestic foreign exchange market, Rules

were issued under the Monetary Law Act No. 58

of 1949 (MLA) requiring exporters to repatriate

export proceeds into the country within 180

days and to convert the same into Sri Lanka

rupees. These rules were amended from time

to time as necessary, adjusting the percentage

of export proceeds required to be converted into

Sri Lanka rupees. Accordingly, the amount of export

proceeds repatriated to Sri Lanka and converted

into Sri Lanka Rupees as required by the Rules

showed a gradual improvement throughout the

year, supporting the domestic foreign exchange

market to a certain extent.

Activities of Restricted Dealers (RDs) who

are authorised to engage in money changing

business were continuously monitored to

ensure their compliance with the Rules and

Regulations. The overall performance of RDs

deteriorated during the year given the subdued

economic activities amidst the pandemic.

Additionally, data on export proceeds collected

from ADs on a monthly basis were continuously

monitored to ensure compliance by exporters

and ADs with the Rules issued under the MLA.

Actions were also taken during 2021 to implement

a comprehensive cross border foreign currency

transactions monitoring system to collect data from

ADs in terms of the Regulations and Directions

issued under the FEA, including inflows/ outflows

of the domestic foreign exchange market, whilst

supporting macroeconomic decision making on

foreign exchange operations.

Credit Information

Despite the challenging environment posed

by COVID-19 pandemic, the Credit Information

Bureau (CRIB) continued its operations by

providing 8.37 million credit reports to member

lending institutions during 2021. However,

reports issued recorded a slight decrease of 3.2

percent compared to the previous year. Demand for

the self-inquiry credit reports (iReports) recorded

a 0.6 per cent decline in 2021, compared to the

year 2020. During the year 2021, 8,114 customers

visited the Bureau to obtain their iReports and

1,438 customers applied for their iReports through

banks. CRIB issued 2,988 self-inquiry credit

reports online in 2021. Also, the demand for the

CRIB Score (Credit Score) Reports increased by

183 per cent in year 2021.

CRIB also supported financial institutions to

roll out debt moratoria. In line with the directions

issued by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank,

CRIB issued reporting guidelines to lenders, which

ensured that credit data of borrowers who availed

debt moratoria were reported in a manner which

had no negative impacts to the credit reports and

credit scores of those borrowers, during the period

under moratoria.

In addition, CRIB accelerated its digital

growth plans to equip its system and processes

to operate more efficiently in the new normal.

Accordingly, CRIB took measures to invest in

upgrading its current system to accommodate

the evolving needs of the users and stakeholders

of CRIB, while enhancing its service standards

and turnaround times. Development of the

Host-to-Host Application Programming Interface

(API), the automation of the personal iReport

issuance and integration of same with Mobile

Banking Applications of member institutions, were

some of the important aspects, to give speed and

ease of access to CRIB users.

Implementation of the Road Map for Sustainable Finance in Sri Lanka

The Central Bank joined the Sustainable

Finance Network supported by the International

Finance Corporation (IFC) in 2016, with a view

to promoting sustainable finance practices in Sri

Lanka. Subsequently, with the technical assistance

of the IFC and the financial assistance of the United

Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the

Central Bank launched a ‘Road Map for Sustainable

Finance in Sri Lanka’ in April 2019. This Road Map

provides a broad direction to financial regulators,

financial institutions, and the markets to effectively

manage environmental, social and governance

(ESG) risks associated with projects they finance

and promotes assistance to businesses that are

greener, climate-friendly, and socially inclusive.

In operationalising the actions of the Road

Map, the Central Bank initiated a process

of devising an applicable Green Finance

Taxonomy in 2021, which is a key requirement

in facilitating the financial sector towards

sustainable finance. The said taxonomy will

establish a classification and measurement

system for green activities and provide a common

consensus to financial institutions in determining

green/sustainable projects. The Central Bank

is working closely with the IFC, which provides

technical and financial support in developing the

Green Finance Taxonomy, and expects to launch it

in the first half of 2022.
