11.3 Deposits with IMF – PRGF – HIPC Trust Deposit
14. 
PROVISIONAL ADVANCES TO GOVERNMENT
The  PRGF  –  HIPC 
(Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth 
These  represent  advances  granted  to  the  Government 
Facility for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries) Trust 
of  Sri  Lanka  (GOSL)  under  Section  89  of  the  Monetary 
Deposit  was  made  under  the  agreement  between  the 
GOSL  and  the  IMF  on  21  April  2000  by  transferring 
SDR  788,783  from  Sri  Lanka’s  deposit  in  the  post 
SCA-2 
(Special  Contingent  Account)  administered 
account with the IMF. This account was created under 
the  guidance  of  the  IMF  by  transferring  the  balance 
held in SCA-2 against  Sri  Lanka when it was  decided 
to wind up SCA-2 by the IMF. The IMF requested the 
countries that had balances in the Post SCA-2 account 
to  consider  providing  the  balances  in  that  account  to 
the  PRGF/HIPC  Trust  either  as  outright  grant  or  as  a 
means  of  providing  a  subsidy  for  PRGF/HIPC  Loan. 
Accordingly  GOSL  agreed  to  transfer  the  funds  from 
Post SCA–2 accounts to PRGF/HIPC Trust account, not 
as an outright grant, but as an interest free deposit until 
2018. This was later extended until 2024.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
