Accordingly, the Bank launched refinance and credit schemes through LCBs and LSBs under the names Saubagya COVID-19 Renaissance Facility Phase I, II, III and Liquidity Facility to the Construction Sector at concessionary interest rates with maturity terms ranging from 6 months to 2 years with the condition of lending by LCBs and LSBs to businesses affected by the pandemic.

This account was created under the guidance of the IMF by transferring the balance held in SCA-2 against Sri Lanka when it was decided to wind up SCA-2 by the IMF. The IMF requested the countries that had balances in the Post SCA-2 account to consider providing the balances in that account to the PRGF/HIPC Trust either as outright grant or as a means of providing a subsidy for PRGF/HIPC Loan. Accordingly GOSL agreed to transfer the funds from Post SCA\u20132 accounts to PRGF/HIPC Trust account, not as an outright grant, but as an interest free deposit until 2018.

Under the scheme, an interest free intra-day liquidity facility, fully collaterized by Government securities is available to participants to meet payment obligations within the day to facilitate smooth functioning of the settlement system. Although these deposits are classified as related parties (i.e., State owned Banks and institutions) and others for the purpose of accounting disclosure requirements, such deposits are maintained in terms of relevant statutory provisions and not because of specific business relationship of the Bank with those state institutions.",

Under Standard & Poor\u2019s ratings and Fitch Ratings, AAA is the highest quality rating possible and indicates the lowest expectations of credit risk. It is assigned only in the case of exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitment. AA is very high quality grade, indicating very low expectation of credit risk, and A is an upper medium grade, indicating a low expectation of credit risk; BBB is the lowest investment grade rating, indicating that there is currently a low expectation of credit risk and exhibits adequate protection parameters, ratings lower than AAA can be modified by + or \u2013 signs to indicate relative standing within the major categories. NR indicates that Standard and Poor\u2019s or Fitch Rating have not rated the entity.",

The MD measures the change in price of a security for a 1% change in the interest rates (yield). A higher MD indicates a higher risk. Hence, the Bank sets an appropriate MD from time to time considering the developments in the financial markets, portfolio characteristics and the risk appetite of the bond portfolio.

    "text": "through Other Comprehensive Income as per the Business Model assessment under IFRS 9. This portfolio is not an investment portfolio, as the Bank does not purchase Government Securities with the intention of earning an interest income. The Bank purchases or sells Government Securities to inject rupee liquidity into the domestic market or to absorb liquidity from the market in the course of carrying out its monetary policy operations in relation to one of its core objectives, maintaining economic and price stability. Hence, the volume of Government Securities in the Bank\u2019s portfolio is determined by its monetary policy operations. In addition, the basic interest rates in the rupee market, the Repo rate and the Reverse Repo rate are policy rates determined by the Bank in the course of implementing its monetary policy. Moreover, the Bank's actions in injecting rupee liquidity or absorbing liquidity from the market have a significant impact on general rupee market interest rates. Thus, changes in the interest income earned from the Government Securities portfolio, which arise from changes in the volume of the Bank\u2019s Government Securities portfolio, as well as changes in interest rates, are primarily a consequence of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy actions, rather than due to investment decisions. Therefore, the Bank does not consider interest rate sensitivities arising from local currency assets.",

To mitigate the impact of low interest rates on the overall portfolio, the EPF Department invested in short to medium term government securities. However, the EPF Department also invested in its preferred long-term government securities (more than 5 years), considering the need to provide a reasonable rate of return for its members in the context of a low interest rate environment. The EPF Department also undertook measures to capitalise on the positive sentiment in the domestic equity market by disposing selected stocks to realise capital gains. Investment opportunities in corporate debentures were limited given the low interest rate regime, while the EPF Department was also conscious of the need to invest in corporates with better credit ratings to mitigate credit risk of the corporate debt portfolio of the EPF.",

It enabled the employers to submit their e-returns through the website and to make the payment online through a participating Licensed Commercial Bank (LCB) via \u2018LankaPay Online Payment Platform (LPOPP)\u2019 or by cheque or direct debit. Bank of Ceylon, People\u2019s Bank and Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC were the LCBs that had joined the EPF Department for this facility by end 2021. One of the salient features of the new system is that it further expedites updating of the individual member accounts within 24 hours upon a successful contribution. Furthermore, it facilitates employers to ensure the accuracy of member records appearing in the contribution detail file by comparing with the respective details in the EPF Department\u2019s database. This would be a significant improvement in establishing a comprehensive database and hence there will be zero or minimal efforts to be exerted in member detail amendments in future.",

Such analyses compliment the microprudential regulation and supervision, which is also an approach followed by central banks in maintaining financial system stability. In this process, MSD conducts systemic risk analysis by using data provided by financial institutions and MSD also gathers data from a myriad of other sources as and when necessary. In addition, MSD conducts stress testing under plausible adverse scenarios to ensure the resilience of the financial system against any adverse shocks. These analyses contribute to the forward-looking policy formulation process of the Central Bank to mitigate and/or avoid systemic risk to maintain financial system stability. A summary of the main activities undertaken by the MSD during 2021 is given below.",
