    "text": "Tourism is defined as \u201ca social, cultural and economic phenomenon which entails the movement of people to countries or places outside their usual environment for personal or business/professional purposes\u201d by the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO). International Tourism (hereinafter referred to as \u201cTourism\u201d) is basically exportation of services. Tourism earnings and expenditure are recorded as \u201cTravel\u201d under \u201cServices\u201d in the Goods and Services Account of the Balance of Payment (Balance of Payment and International Investment Position Manual - BPM 6 of the International Monetary Fund). Tourism remains an important source of net foreign currency earnings for a country, as the foreign currency outflows on account of inputs are minimal. In addition to earning foreign currency, the tourism industry also contributes to economic growth, employment, and reduction in regional income disparity. Sri Lanka\u2019s strategic location, attractive natural endowments, cultural diversity, and rich history, together with the peaceful, clean, safe and foreigner-friendly environment, provide the basis for this industry to flourish. Therefore, development of the tourism industry will be a key economic priority, particularly in the post-pandemic economic recovery period, to mitigate external sector imbalances in the country.",

    "text": "Tourism remained the third largest source of foreign currency earnings between 2014 and 2019 and contributed to about 14 per cent of total foreign currency earnings during this period. Although export earnings, which is the largest source of foreign currency earnings, grew from US dollars 8,626 million in 2010 to US dollars 12,499 million in 2021, generation of earnings through such exports needed a considerable amount of import expenditure on account of inputs. However, tourism as a single industry has been able to generate substantial earnings with a relatively low reliance on imports of inputs. For instance, in the peak year of tourism in Sri Lanka, i.e., 2018, earnings from tourism, estimated at US dollars 4,381 million, outnumbered net export earnings of the apparel industry, that is, export earnings net of import expenditure on textiles (US dollars 2,459 million), and export earnings by other key industries such as tea (US dollars 1,428 million) and rubber products (US dollars 875 million). Meanwhile, workers\u2019 remittances, which have been the second largest source of foreign currency earnings, brought an average of US dollars 7,023 million per annum between 2014 and 2019 despite falling to US dollars 5,491 million in 2021. Therefore, tourism is an important source of foreign currency earnings to Sri Lanka and has a key role to play in maintaining the country\u2019s resilience to external sector pressures.",

    "text": "The global tourism industry recorded a steady growth in the recent decades despite setbacks suffered from time to time due to occurrences such as the global financial crisis and outbreaks of epidemics. Tourist arrivals reached 1,468 million by 2019 according to UNWTO. Sri Lanka too saw a continuous increase in tourism arrivals in the past until 2018, with a substantial increase from 2010 when the civil war ended. In fact, in 2018, Sri Lanka was named the top destination for the year 2019 by the acclaimed tourism information provider \u201cLonely Planet.\u201d However, unfortunately, tourism arrivals in 2019 saw a set back because of the terrorist attacks on Easter Sunday in April 2019, though global tourist arrivals reached the record highest in that year. Despite this setback, tourist arrivals and earnings showed a recovery by end of 2019 and early 2020, before starting to decline again because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile the global tourism industry is expected to record a slow recovery in the forthcoming years. According to a survey conducted by UNWTO in January 2022 among its panel of tourism experts, 63 per cent of respondents expected that international tourist arrivals in their countries will not recover to the 2019 level until 2024, while 79 per cent of the respondents believed that arrivals in the Asia Pacific region will not recover to 2019 levels until 2024. However, UNWTO, World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) and market analysts have shown that there is substantial pent-up savings and a yearning to travel among potential travellers, while tourism characteristics have fundamentally changed because of the pandemic. Therefore, there is a potential for Sri Lanka to attract a substantial number of tourists and/or generate substantial foreign currency earnings from tourism even in 2022 and 2023, if appropriate strategies are implemented efficiently and effectively.",

Meanwhile, rules were issued by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in January 2022 requiring hotel service providers to accept payments from non-residents only in foreign currency, which will ensure the inflow of foreign currency to the country on account of tourism. This also allows the tourism sector to strengthen its earnings in foreign currency without major capital investments, as the sector has made heavy investments in local and foreign currency. Meanwhile, some small-scale hotels kept afloat by renting hotels as quarantine centres when the industry as a whole suffered a significant setback due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

For example, travellers are skeptic of booking well in advance owing to the sudden changes in restrictions imposed by countries and risks from testing positive for COVID-19. Further, travellers prefer accommodation and transport options that allow sudden cancellations without a penalty. Secondly, due to the normalisation of remote working through the pandemic, concepts such as \u201cdigital nomads\u201d and \u201cstaycations\u201d have become popular, and travellers seek long duration visa, long duration discounts at places of accommodation, fast internet, and other work-related facilities. International tourism organisations further note that the length of stay and spending on a trip increased in 2021. Thirdly, the profile of travellers has changed with more younger travellers (in their 20s to 40s) opting to travel, rather than older persons or families with small children due to health concerns. Therefore, the tourism industry and the country as a whole should be able to accommodate the needs and preferences of such tourists. This age group values adventure and individualism and they use mobile phones and digital services to plan and book their trips and rely on social media, blogs and online reviews of other travellers. Fourthly, appreciation of the value of mental health and personal wellness has increased notably in the recent past and consumer interest in achieving these needs through travelling has also increased. There is also an interest for \u201cphilantourism\u201d where tourists can get involved in philanthropical activities and \u201cecotourism\u201d to gain knowledge about ecological centres around the world. Fifth, the tendency to go on secondary trips, exploring lesser-known attractions near places of main tourism interests and rural tourism has also increased.",

Further, noise pollution near attractions and places of accommodation should be managed. Supervising practices that tourism service providers are engaged in are environmentally friendly (for example, whale watching tours disturbing whales) is also important.

Crowding in National Parks have gathered considerable negative publicity lately. Meanwhile, even the ancient cities of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa do not attract a significant number of tourists (Table 86 of the Statistical Appendix). Other areas of the country provide ideal locations to conduct wellness, rural, philanthropical, adventure tourism etc. and tourists should be directed to attractions in these areas. Meanwhile, tourists are compelled to go through inconveniences such as buying tickets at individual tourism sites and not having updated information online about events (such as \u201cPeraharas\u201d and festivals, even the small-scale ones), public transport, security services, dress code at religious sites, prohibited items in national parks, etc. Therefore, incorporation of such information and the facility to purchase customised ticket bundles as per individual preference to the mobile app being developed or to a website dedicated to tourists will be highly beneficial. Digital technologies can also be used to provide touchless service delivery methods, QR Code based contactless payment options and to store and share health and safety information.",

Hence, its implementation needs to be fast tracked. In addition, high frequency data on a multitude of other aspects is necessary, such as characteristics of persons arriving under tourist visas, how much they are spending and for what and where, satisfaction level, employment in tourism, number and types of direct and indirect tourism service providers and various spatial information. The need for national tourism authorities to enhance their market research capabilities to improve the customer journey, trigger innovation and offer insights to the private sector has been highlighted in multi-country studies conducted during the pandemic by the International Monetary Fund as well.

Incidentally, over-reliance on tourism is a feature of countries that have been less successful in other exports and are suffering from such features. Such tourism-dependent countries have a relatively low level of export complexity that affects their options for new product development. Development of new products requires the expansion of the productive knowledge and capacities. Tourism is not an industry that enhances the technological capacity of a country and is highly vulnerable to external shocks. In the aforementioned publication, the IMF shows the prudence of tourism-dependent countries (which includes Sri Lanka) to nurture other goods and services export sectors using new digital economy tools or focus on overall export development. As suggested in this report, in the medium-term, Sri Lanka should re-think its tourism model and undertake necessary structural reforms.",

    "text": "Efficient and safe movement of funds within a country and across the borders is an important component of the financial system of a country. This is more important for cross border transfers where foreign exchange is involved. Usually, a vast majority of these transactions occur through formal channels. However, in any economy, in varying sizes, there exist informal money transfer channels mainly for cross border transactions. The extent of informal channels and the use of formal channels by money remitters depends on the characteristics of a particular economy and financial market and the legitimacy of such transactions. Formal channels consist of the services provided by licensed and regulated entities such as financial institutions. Informal channels consist of participants of the unregulated markets such as Hawala, Hundi or Undiyal (in South Asia), Fei Qian or Chit (in South East Asia) and Black-market Peso (in European countries) service providers who have not been licensed to perform money remittance services in several countries. However, at present, certain countries with informal money transfer channels such as Germany, United Kingdom and United States of America pursue regulatory approaches in registration and licensing such service providers along with imposing anti-money laundering requirements. Hawala channels have been continuously used in moving the value of money from one place to another, without the physical movement of funds, since ancient times, when there were no formal banking channels. However, such informal channels still exist today, even though banking transactions have been made ultra-easy, as convenient as effecting by using a mobile app. These informal remitting services are used for legitimate as well as illegitimate purposes by various individuals, groups and entities. Such services are heavily exploited for criminal activities, even including laundering of money and financing of terrorism. For instance, Hawala channels were used to finance the activities that led to the deadly terrorist attack on the US World Trade Centre in 2001. Some favourable characteristics such as low cost of transactions, easy access, less paperwork, and quick transfers make these channels popular among remitters. However, being an informal business with the involvement of possible criminal activities, the possibility of losing money makes them a risky channel. Most importantly, these channels are highly vulnerable to misuse by money launderers and terrorist financiers. These types of informal and illegitimate payment channels could be detrimental to the smooth functioning of financial systems and economic activity of a country, as they move economic resources from the formal sector to the informal sector of an economy. This article intends to shed light on the adverse impacts of informal money remittance channels on financial systems and the economy of a country. Since all these informal remittance channels have more or less the same characteristics, the article will focus on the mainly used channel in Sri Lanka, namely Hawala,",

In these arrangements, the value transfers are facilitated by agents belonging to these networks who are located all over the world. In the Hawala channels, the Hawala agents or dealers (also known as Hawala Dars) live in different countries and settlements of transactions occur completely based on trust. An agent in one country collects money from people who need to send money to another country and the agent in that particular country settles those amounts to the intended recipients in the currency they desire. Accordingly, there is no physical cash movement across the borders, no financial institutions are involved in cross border transactions, and no transactions are properly recorded under these channels.

Accessibility: informal channels have subtly penetrated every corner of the world and made their way into most economic activities including remote areas where formal banking facilities are limited or not available. Affordability: charges associated with fund remittances through formal banking channels are expensive when compared to the commissions involved in Hawala. Also, usually, the exchange rate offered by Hawala agents is more attractive than that of authorised dealers in foreign exchange. Speed: there are no cross border movements of currency in these informal channels and the amount equivalent to the foreign currency value is locally settled either by depositing funds to an account of the recipient or by settling in cash. In some instances, the recipients receive the money within a couple of hours and some have the option to receive money to their doorstep upon revealing the password to the respective Hawala agent.

Possible anonymity: this is the most appealing feature of Hawala. No paper or documentary proof is required for these arrangements. Hence, it is an indirect invitation for people who need to maintain secrecy in their transactions. Further, the legitimacy of the source of funds is not questioned by service providers since these agents are not subject to any regulatory supervision. In general, the more exchange and monetary restrictions and controls, the higher would be Hawala and Undial activities as customers in the formal sector also tend to patronize these services.",

    "text": "Informal money remitting channels provide a convenient platform for illegal money transfers through money laundering and terrorist financing activities. Money laundering is simply the conversion of money generated from illicit crimes into legally accepted money. The process of money laundering involves the following three steps. The first step is the placement where proceeds of the illicit crime are placed in the financial channel, i.e., in bank accounts. The second step is layering, which involves a series of transactions involved to conceal the origin of the proceeds of the illicit crime. The final step is integration where proceeds of the illicit crime are absorbed into the economy. Terrorist financing is the act of funding terrorist activities and/or organisations. The source of financing terrorism can be legal or illegal. Continuous inflows to backup terrorist activities are a must to continue the agendas of terrorist groups. Hence, different avenues are misused by terrorists for their funding needs.",

Hawala transactions are also used by importers and exporters of a country for the purpose of avoiding taxation on goods. For example, an importer could request the overseas exporter to underquote the invoices thereby reducing the tax to be paid to the government by the importer.

In addition, the RBI has implemented actions to enhance the quality of formal financial services such as establishing branches of commercial banks in rural areas to access the formal financial sector and permitted the non-bank financial sector to access Money Transfer Service Schemes to contain the impact of Hawala channels. Subsequently, the Indian Government enacted The Financial Exchange Management Act in the 1970s. Pakistan took steps towards the transformation of money changers to foreign exchange companies in which they were given a two year period to register and comply. The publication made by the Financial Action Task Force titled The Role of Hawala and other Similar Service Providers in ML/TF in 2013, clearly explains strategies to identify unregulated Hawala and other similar service providers and possible avenues to create incentives to formalise their business. At present, authorities plan to pursue steps to implement an appropriate legal framework to monitor and legalise Hawala channels in Sri Lanka.",

Migrant workers have been incentivised to switch to Hawala channels by the premium paid on the foreign exchange conversion rate by Hawala agents. The drastic drop in workers\u2019 remittances in 2021 negatively affected the BOP position in Sri Lanka. It has been reported that Sri Lankan importers too use Hawala channels to pay their import bills because of the shortage of foreign currency supply in formal channels arising from exchange rate differentials even though the use of Hawala channels to obtain foreign currency is expensive. Overall, the popularity of Hawala channels in recent times has deprived the country from receiving crucial flows of foreign currency through formal channels, thus dampening the supply of foreign exchange, and shrinking foreign currency reserves creating BOP concerns. Thus, the expansion of Hawala channels poses a significant threat to the BOP position in Sri Lanka. However, if formal channels can continuously maintain a competitive exchange rate based on market demand and supply, the demand for informal remittance channels is expected to be contained, as the exchange rate differential is expected to reduce substantially.",
