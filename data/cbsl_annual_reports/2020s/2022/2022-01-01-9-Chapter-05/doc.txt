5.1 OverviewS

ri Lanka’s external sector experienced heightened vulnerabilities in 2021 amidst persistently high

debt service obligations and a weakened balance of payments (BOP) position along with lacklustre

performance in the domestic foreign exchange market with continuous pressure on the external

value of the currency. Although a rebound and a steady growth were observed in exports, a much higher

import expenditure resulted in the trade deficit widening notably, weighing negatively on the external current

account. The expansion in the trade deficit was driven by the significant increase in imports, even in the

presence of selected import restrictions, which outpaced the growth of exports. The widening of the trade

deficit was more pronounced in the latter part of 2021 and in early 2022 due to the combined effect of a

sharp revival in imports due to the normalisation of economic activities as well as higher energy prices.

The performance of the services sector remained subdued in both 2020 and 2021 despite the healthy

growth in the computer services subsector, while the tourism sector only picked up towards the latter part

of 2021. The deficit in the primary income account reduced marginally in 2021 compared to the previous

year as interest and dividend payments were low during 2021. A slowdown in workers’ remittances was

observed during the second half of the year, resulting in a notable decline in the surplus of the secondary

income account. Consequently, the current account deficit widened significantly to 4.0 per cent of the Gross

Domestic Product (GDP) in 2021, compared to 1.5 per cent of GDP registered in 2020. The financial account

also recorded a subdued performance as foreign investments in the form of foreign direct investment

(FDI) remained subdued, while portfolio investments in the stock exchange and the government securities

market also continued to witness net outflows. Adding pressure on external accounts, foreign inflows to the

Government were limited to foreign project loans and grants as well as two foreign currency term financing

facilities. The Central Bank received foreign exchange flows on account of the new Special Drawing Rights

(SDR) allocation from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and international swap arrangements with the

Bangladesh Bank and the People’s Bank of China

(PBOC) in 2021 and Reserve Bank of India (RBI)

in early 2022. In view of mounting imbalances in

the external sector due to lack of foreign exchange

inflows, several measures were taken to improve

foreign currency liquidity in the domestic foreign

exchange market and to replenish international

reserves. The Central Bank imposed mandatory

conversion requirements on export proceeds and

directed banks to sell a part of the converted export

proceeds and workers’ remittances to the Central

Bank. The Central Bank and the Government also

implemented several measures to induce workers’

remittances during the year. At the same time,

taking into consideration the dearth of foreign

exchange liquidity in the market, the Central Bank

provided financing support for the importation of

essential goods, mainly fuel, LP gas and coal, as

a national priority in 2021 and 2022. Although the

exchange rate was broadly maintained at a stable

level during 2021 and in early 2022 to support the

recovery process of the economy, considering

the emerging difficulties in the external front, the

Central Bank allowed a measured adjustment

in the exchange rate since early March 2022.

However, the notable pressures witnessed in

the domestic foreign exchange market caused a

large overshooting. Consequently, the Sri Lanka

rupee which depreciated by 7.0 per cent in 2021,

depreciated significantly by 33.0 per cent by

end March 2022. Having identified the need for

implementing urgent measures to address the

current external sector crisis, and to complement

them with broader economic reforms aimed at

resolving persistent and long standing issues in

the economy, the Government and the Central

Bank initiated further measures in early 2022,

including the initiation of engagements with the

IMF and to manage the country's external debt in

a sustainable manner.

5.2 Current Account Balance

Despite the increase in the services account

balance and the decline in the primary income

account deficit, the external current account

deficit widened significantly in 2021 as a result

of the widened trade deficit and the decline in

the surplus in the secondary income account.

Higher import expenditure compared to export

earnings resulted in a widened trade deficit of

around US dollars 8.1 billion in 2021 as opposed

to the relatively lower trade deficit of US dollars 6.0

billion recorded in 2020. The surplus in the services

account increased due to higher inflows observed

on account of information technology led business

process outsourcing (IT/BPO) related services and

improvements in the transport sector. The tourism

sector also showed signs of revival during the latter

part of the year. The deficit in the primary income

account contracted with the decline in dividend

payments of Direct Investment Enterprises (DIEs)

and coupon payments on account of government

securities held by foreign investors despite the

increase recorded in reinvested earnings of DIEs.

In comparison to 2020, workers’ remittances

contracted notably during 2021, particularly

during the latter half of the year, possibly due to

a notable difference in exchange rate in the grey

market compared to the official rate that prevailed

at that time. As a result, the current account deficit

widened to US dollars 3.3 billion in 2021, compared to US dollars 1.2 billion recorded in 2020. Reflecting the expansion in the current account deficit and a moderate expansion in the output, the current account deficit as a percentage of GDP stood at 4.0

per cent in 2021, compared to 1.5 per cent in 2020.

5.2.1 Merchandise Trade Account

Trade Balance

The deficit in the trade account that

contracted during the last two years, widened

notably in 2021 as the steady increase in exports

was outpaced by the sharp increase in imports.

The deficit in the trade account widened to US

dollars 8,139 million in 2021 from US dollars 6,008

million in 2020. Contributing to the expansion in the

trade deficit, imports increased notably, primarily

driven by higher commodity prices, including prices

of fuel, increased demand for imported items

due to normalisation of economic activity, higher

import expenditure on account of medical and

pharmaceutical items such as vaccines, and the

relaxation of some of the restrictions on importation

of non-essential goods. As a percentage of GDP,

the trade deficit widened to 9.6 per cent in 2021,

compared to 7.4 per cent in 2020.

Export and Import Performance, Terms of Trade and Direction of Trade

Export Performance

Earnings from merchandise exports reached

US dollars 12,499 million in 2021, recording

the highest level of export earnings for a

year, exceeding the previously highest export

earnings of US dollars 11,940 million that was

recorded in 2019. Accordingly, export earnings

grew by 24.4 per cent compared to US dollars

10,047 million recorded during 2020. Indicating

the strong export performance, earnings from

exports continued to exceed US dollars 1.0 billion

consecutively every month from June 2021.

Further, the highest ever monthly export value of

US dollars 1,211 million was recorded in November

2021. The increase in export earnings during

2021 resulted from the broad-based increase in

earnings from most export categories. Special

policy attention received from the Government,

the Central Bank, and other relevant authorities,

particularly through the setting up of new follow

up mechanisms and granting incentives towards

export-oriented industries and industries affected

by the pandemic, recovery of domestic production

due to the rapid vaccination rollout, and the gradual

revival of both demand and supply market chains

with the normalisation of global markets were the

main drivers of higher export earnings. As evident

from the movements in the export volume and

unit value indices, the increase in export volumes

significantly contributed to the increase in export

earnings. As a percentage of GDP, export earnings

increased to 14.8 per cent in 2021 from 12.4 per

cent recorded in 2020.

Earnings from industrial exports increased

by 26.5 per cent to US dollars 9,702 million in 2021

compared to 2020, accounting approximately

78 per cent of the total exports. While the growth

within the industrial exports category was broad-

based, earnings from textiles and garments exports

recorded a growth of 22.9 per cent reaching US

dollars 5,435 million during 2021 and contributing

more than 40 per cent of the increase in the total

exports. Increases in earnings from all major export

destinations of garments led to this increase. Exports

of rubber products, led by solid tyres and household

rubber gloves, supported the rubber product sector

to record an improved performance while becoming

the third most prominent export sector of Sri Lanka,

which exceeded US dollars 1 billion after garments

and tea. Earnings from petroleum exports increased,

led by bunkering and aviation fuel exports, due to

the increase in average export prices despite the low

volume of supply. The increase in the food, beverages

and tobacco category was mainly driven by value

added coconut products, animal or vegetable fats

and oils, and crustaceans preparations (mainly

crabs). However, reflecting the weakened demand

for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) exported

by Sri Lanka, earnings from made up textile articles

(mainly facemasks) and plastic clothing articles

categorised under plastics and articles thereof

declined considerably during 2021.

With the improved performance of most of the

subcategories, agricultural exports recorded a

growth of 16.8 per cent in 2021 compared to

2020. Higher earnings from spices, tea, seafood

and coconut products mainly contributed to this

increase, while export earnings from vegetables

declined. Offsetting the decline in average export

prices, the increase in export volume of 7.7 per

cent led to the increase in earnings from tea

exports in 2021. The higher earnings recorded

by natural rubber, spices (mainly cinnamon and

nutmeg) and unmanufactured tobacco products

were driven by higher export prices, whereas both

higher prices and volumes led to the increase in

earnings from seafood, pepper and coconut (both

kernel and non-kernel products). Earnings from

minor agricultural products increased due to higher

export volumes of fruits, cereals and essential oil

exports. However, the lower export volumes led

to the weak performance of vegetable exports,

despite higher prices.

Earnings from mineral exports, which

account for less than 1 per cent of total exports,

improved by 77.3 per cent in 2021 compared

to the previous year. Titanium ores categorised

under ores, slag and ash primarily contributed to

this increase, while increases in natural graphite

and quartz led to the increase in earnings from

earths and stones and precious metals.

Import Performance

Amidst the continuation of certain import

restrictions, mainly on personal vehicle imports,

expenditure on imports increased considerably

by 28.5 per cent to US dollars 20,637 million

in 2021 compared to 2020. The increasing

demand for inputs with the resumption of domestic

economic activities, elevated price levels in global

commodity markets, including fuel prices, higher

reliance on refined petroleum due to intermittent

closures of the refinery, higher expenditure on

account of medical and pharmaceutical items such

as vaccines, and the relaxation of some import

restrictions mainly accounted for the increase in

imports despite extremely low imports of personal

motor vehicles. Import growth was broad-based

as observed in the increases in almost all major

categories of imports. As observed by movements

in import volume and unit value indices, in general,

import expenditure was influenced by both volume

and price increases, despite the effect of volume

and price changes varying across major categories

of imports. As a per cent of GDP, import expenditure

increased to 24.4 per cent in 2021, compared to

19.8 per cent in 2020.

Accounting for more than half of total import

expenditure, expenditure on intermediate

goods contributed largely to the increase in

imports during 2021. Expenditure on intermediate

goods imports increased by 35.6 per cent to US

dollars 12,309 million during the year. During 2021,

as the largest expenditure item of the country’s

import bill, fuel imports, on account of crude oil,

refined petroleum (including LP gas), and coal,

increased to US dollars 3,743 million compared to

US dollars 2,543 million in 2020. Notable increases

in average prices of all three subcategories, as

well as the increased import volumes of refined

petroleum, caused the fuel bill to rise, offsetting

the effect of low volumes of crude oil and coal

imports. Import expenditure on textiles and textile

articles, the second largest import item, surpassed

the US dollars 3 billion mark for the first time. This

was led by the increase in expenditure on fabrics

and yarn, which were utilised to meet the higher

demand for Sri Lankan garments from major export

destinations such as countries in the EU, the UK

and the USA. Imports of chemical products (mainly

carbon) surpassed US dollars 1 billion for the

first time, while other import categories including

base metals (mainly iron and steel), plastics and

articles in primary form, and natural and synthetic

rubber recorded high growth rates during the

year. However, the ban that prevailed during most

parts of 2021 on importing chemical fertiliser led

to lower expenditure on fertiliser (mainly urea),

while unmanufactured tobacco and mineral

products such as cement clinkers recorded lower

expenditure values in 2021 compared to 2020.

Expenditure on investment goods, which

accounted for around 22 per cent of total

import expenditure, increased by 25.2 per cent

to US dollars 4,463 million in 2021. Expenditure

on all import items categorised under machinery

and equipment increased in 2021 compared to

2020, except for the machinery and equipment

parts, while office machines (mainly computers),

5telecommunication devices (mainly transmission

apparatus) and medical and laboratory equipment

contributed the most to this increase. Imports

of building material and transport equipment

(including commercial use vehicles) also increased

despite the continuation of some import restriction

measures throughout 2021. The increase in the

building material category was driven by iron and

steel imports amidst the lower expenditure on

cement, while expenditure on agricultural tractors,

lorries and railway equipment led to the increase in

transport equipment imports.

Expenditure on non-food consumer goods

increased by 18.1 per cent to US dollars 2,182

million in 2021 compared to US dollars 1,847

million in 2020. The largest contribution to this

increase was from medical and pharmaceuticals,

particularly the vaccines imported under the

COVID-19 vaccination programme. Mobile

telephones, rubber tyres and televisions were

among the other categories that contributed to

the notable increase in the imports of non-food

consumer goods. However, with the continuation

of restrictions imposed by the Government and the

Central Bank since March 2020, the importation of

vehicles for personal use was at a very low level

during 2021 compared to 2019 and 2020.

Expenditure on food and beverages imports

increased by 7.2 per cent in 2021 compared

to 2020. Higher imports of coconut oil led the oils

and fats category to record the largest increase

in the food and beverages category, while the

importation of rice, mainly towards the end of the

year (about US dollars 63 million during the last

two months of 2021), caused the cereals and

milling industry products category to record a

considerable increase during 2021 compared to

2020. Dhal, sugar and fresh fruits were the other

major food items that recorded an increased import

expenditure in 2021. However, expenditure related

to seafood, beverages and dairy products declined

during 2021 driven by low import expenditure on

canned fish and sprats, alcoholic beverages and

milk powder, respectively. The rise in unit values

largely contributed to the significant increase in

import expenditure.

Terms of Trade

The terms of trade, which is the ratio of export

prices to import prices, deteriorated for Sri Lanka

in 2021. The export price index increased by 5.4

per cent to 92.4 index points, while the import price

index increased by a higher rate of 15.2 per cent to

94.9 index points. The increases in the price indices

of all major categories of exports contributed to the

increase in export prices while higher prices of the

importation of intermediate goods and consumer

goods mainly accounted for the increase in the

overall import price index. As such, the terms of trade

deteriorated by 8.6 per cent to 97.4 index points in

2021 indicating that the amount of imports can be

purchased from a unit of exports has declined, as the

import price index increased at a higher pace than the

export price index.

The expansion in trade volumes contributed

significantly to the increase in both export

earnings and import expenditure during 2021.

The export volume indices for all three main

categories of exports improved, while the import

volume indices for intermediate and investment

goods increased during the year. However, the

import volume index for consumer goods marginally

decreased in 2021.

Direction of Trade

Sri Lanka continued to have similar major

trading partners in 2021 compared to the

previous year. In value terms, India regained its

position as the main trading partner of Sri Lanka in

2021, followed by China and the USA, all of which

together contributed to around 42 per cent of total

trade (both exports and imports) of Sri Lanka. Total

trade with India and China exceeded US dollars 5

billion each, while trade with the USA exceeded

US dollars 3.5 billion. The UAE, the UK and

Germany were the other major trading partners,

accounting for more than US dollars 1 billion each

in 2021. As per the country wise trade balances

in 2021, notable trade surpluses were recorded

with Western countries such as the USA, the UK,

Germany, Netherlands, Italy and Belgium, while

significant trade deficits were recorded with Asian

countries such as China, India, the UAE, Malaysia,

and Singapore.

The USA and European countries remained

the major destinations for Sri Lankan exports

in 2021. The USA continued to be the single

largest buyer of Sri Lankan exports with more

than US dollars 3 billion worth of exports, which

accounted for 24.9 per cent of total exports,

followed by the UK (7.5 per cent), India (6.6 per

cent), Germany (6.1 per cent) and Italy (4.6 per

cent). In line with increased exports, earnings

from most destinations, including the top ten

export destinations of Sri Lanka, increased during

2021. Garments, rubber products, machinery

and mechanical appliances, and food, beverages

and tobacco were major products exported to the

USA. The USA continued to be the single largest

garment export destination for Sri Lanka with

a share of 42 per cent of total garment exports

in 2021. Exports to the UK were denominated

by garments, rubber products, made up textile

articles, food, beverages and tobacco, machinery

and mechanical appliance and seafood. Exports

to India included spices, animal fodder, textiles,

food, beverages and tobacco, wood and paper

products and minor agricultural products. The EU

as a region accounted for about 24 per cent of

total exports in 2021, including about 30 per cent

of total garment exports. Rubber products, food,

beverages and tobacco, tea, seafood, machinery

and mechanical appliances and coconut kernel

products were among the other major items

exported to the EU. In 2021, the Middle East and

the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)

led by Russia were the main export destinations

for tea, jointly contributing to about 58 per cent of

tea exports by Sri Lanka.

Asian countries continued to be the major

source of Sri Lankan imports in 2021. China

continued to be the largest source of imports for

the third consecutive year, recording more than

US dollars 4.7 billion of imports in 2021, with a

share of about 23 per cent of total imports. Import

expenditure from China increased by 33 per cent,

mainly due to higher imports of machinery and

equipment, textiles and textile articles, building

material, and medical and pharmaceuticals. India

and the UAE followed suit as the second and the

third largest import sourcing countries in 2021,

accounting for shares of about 22.4 per cent and

6.8 per cent, respectively. Expenditure on import

items from India increased by 50 per cent, due

to petroleum products, textiles and textile articles,

base metals, and wheat. Major imports from the

UAE were petroleum products, base metals and

building materials, which contributed to around

86 per cent of total imports from the UAE. As an

import source, Malaysia gained the fourth position

in 2021 due to increases in major import items

such as petroleum products, food preparations,

machinery and equipment, chemical products, and

oils and fats. The major imports from Singapore in

2021 consisted of petroleum products, chemical

products and machinery and equipment. As an

import source, Japan was positioned at the tenth

position in 2021 compared to the sixth position in

2020, mainly due to restrictions on vehicle imports

during the year.

External Trade Policies, Developments and Institutional Support

The revival of the merchandise trade sector

in 2021 was supported by the policy support

and the efforts of all the stakeholders of the

sector amidst the devastating impact of the

pandemic. The policy stimuli from the Government

and the Central Bank, together with improving

global economic conditions helped the export

sector rebound beyond pre-pandemic levels.

The Government’s efforts to support domestic

producers by developing import substitutes to

several agricultural and industrial products while

conducting aggressive export promotion and

maintaining low taxes continued throughout the

year. At the beginning of 2021, the Presidential

Task Force on Economic Revival and Poverty

Alleviation focused its attention on encouraging

export earnings and other non-debt inflows of

foreign exchange through combined efforts with

relevant stakeholders to align their activities in a

streamlined and targeted manner. Accordingly,

several subcommittees coordinated by the Central

Bank were initiated for each major sector such as

merchandise trade (textiles and garments, gem and

jewellery, rubber products, tea, coconut products,

fisheries, spices and minor agricultural export

crops), tourism earnings, workers’ remittances

and foreign investments. These subcommittees

attempted to achieve assigned targets while

engaging with relevant stakeholders to overcome

immediate issues and bottlenecks that hinder the

progress of each sector. At the same time, the

Ministry of Trade initiated formulating a National

Trade Policy to strengthen policy guidance on trade.

Meanwhile, the World Trade Organization (WTO)

estimates that the growth of world merchandise

trade volume rebounded by 9.8 per cent in 2021

(from a contraction of 5.0 per cent in 2020)

moderating to 3.0 per cent in 2022 while authorities

would need to focus on securing the export share in

international markets through appropriate policies

and support.

Several import restrictive measures were

relaxed during 2021. Import controls adopted by

the Government during the first half of 2020 due

to external sector pressures were gradually lifted

during 2021. A series of Extraordinary Gazettes

were issued in this regard by the Department of

Imports and Exports Control setting out directions

on import controls during 2020 and 2021, under the

guidance of the Tariff Determination Committee

appointed by His Excellency the President. These

restrictions were imposed temporarily, in order to

preserve foreign exchange, primarily on selected

non-essential and non-urgent import items with a

minimum expected impact on domestic industries

and consumers. However, since June 2021, these

import restrictions were significantly reduced,

although the Central Bank imposed a 100 per

cent cash margin deposit requirement against the

importation of selected non-essential/non-urgent

goods made under letters of credit and documents

against acceptance terms with Licensed

Commercial Banks and National Savings Bank for

a brief period during September 2021. In addition,

the importation of inorganic fertiliser was restricted

in May 2021 in line with the Government’s policy

move to transit to organic agriculture. However,

these measures were also relaxed by November

2021. Considering the continuous pressure on the

external sector, the Government imposed several

restrictions on selected non-urgent and non-

essential consumer items during March 2022 such

as import licenses requirements, while increasing

import duties.

Several measures were undertaken to

improve the institutional support to the

external sector during 2021 aiming to support

the recovery of the sector from the impact of

the pandemic. The Export Development Board

(EDB) continued with the implementation of the

National Export Strategy (NES) 2018-2022, while

recommencing the promotional activities. The NES

Action Plan was continuously implemented in the

areas of market development, product and supply

chain development and capacity building. While

continuing web based promotional activities, the

EDB recommenced participation in physical trade

fairs, business-to-business promotion programmes,

and brand promotion campaigns, which were

mostly limited to the virtual mode during 2020.

Trade chambers also contributed towards export

promotion, helping to link-up the public and private

sector stakeholders in policymaking and grievance

handling. The Sri Lanka Standards Institution

(SLSI) continued the process of formulation and

upgrading of national standards, which helped

local manufacturers compete with foreign products.

Accordingly, to improve national standards to be in

line with international standards, the SLSI revised

128 standards out of 327 published standards by end

2021. Amidst the challenging market environment,

the Sri Lanka Export Credit Insurance Corporation

(SLECIC) reported about Rs.48.7 billion worth

of insured businesses recording an increase

of Rs.11.6 billion over the previous year. The

modernisation programme for Sri Lanka Customs

(SLC) continued under ten subcommittees that

analysed operational and management processes

and provided recommendations on required

reforms. Meanwhile, a Presidential Commission

of Inquiry was appointed in February 2021 to

investigate and report on matters related to the SLC

with a view to improving processes and preventing

revenue leakages. The SLC streamlined its

activities further, in relation to the implementation

of the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) of the

WTO.

Sri Lanka’s exports under trade agreements

improved in 2021 in line with the increase in

overall earnings from exports. During the period

under review, trade with the main trading partners,

namely, the EU and the USA under Generalized

System of Preferences (GSP) schemes, paved the

way for increased market opportunities. Sri Lanka

is expected to benefit from the current EU GSP+

scheme until its validity period ends in 2023 as

established following Sri Lanka’s reclassification

as a lower middle income country in July 2020.

The US GSP scheme expired on 31 December

2020 and is expected to be reauthorised on a

retroactive basis as per the general practice of the

US Government. The UK’s Global Tariffs (UKGT),

which is a different tariff system from that of the EU,

came into effect on 01 January 2021 and Sri Lanka

as an EU GSP+ beneficiary, continued to enjoy

the same duty free access to the UK. However,

the UK is expected to implement a new GSP

scheme from 2022 onwards and the Department of

Commerce of Sri Lanka has provided the required

inputs to the relevant authorities in the UK. The

GSP scheme offered by Japan, which expired on

31 March 2021, was extended for a period of 10

years until 2031. In addition, Sri Lanka continued to

benefit from GSP schemes offered by several other

countries, such as the Russian Federation, Turkey,

Australia, Canada, Switzerland, Norway and New

Zealand, although their contribution to exports

remained relatively low. Under bilateral Free Trade

Agreements (FTAs), the Indo-Sri Lanka Free Trade

Agreement (ISFTA) and the Pakistan Sri Lanka Free

Trade Agreement (PSFTA) continued to benefit Sri

Lanka, contributing to an increase in exports under

FTAs in 2021. Exports through FTAs with India and

Pakistan remained high around 65 per cent of total

exports to these countries in 2021. Meanwhile, the

share of imports under the ISFTA and the PSFTA

was below 5 per cent (US dollars 209 million) and

3 per cent (US dollars 12 million), respectively,

of total imports from India and Pakistan. Under

regional trade agreements, exports under the Asia

Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA) (due to higher

exports to China, South Korea and Bangladesh)

and Global System of Trade Preferences (GSTP)

(due to higher cinnamon exports to Mexico)

improved during 2021. Mongolia joined as the

seventh member of the APTA in September

2020, and other Participating States, including Sri

Lanka, exchanged tariff concessions reciprocally

with Mongolia with effect from 01 January 2021.

Exports under the SAARC Preferential Trading

Arrangement (SAPTA) continued to remain at low

levels while exports under the South Asian Free

Trade Area (SAFTA) improved during 2021. Sri

Lanka’s multilateral trade engagement with the WTO

continued in 2021. Work is underway to negotiate

and enter into preferential trade agreements with

trade partners with future potential, such as China,

Japan, Indonesia and Bangladesh, and the review

process of the Singapore-Sri Lanka FTA continued

during 2021. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka could also

seek the possibility of joining other regional trade

agreements such as the Regional Comprehensive

Economic Partnership (RCEP) to expand and

diversify the export market.

5.2.2 Services Account

The surplus in the services account recorded

a notable increase in 2021 compared to the

previous year, but remained lower than the

pre-pandemic and pre-Easter Sunday attacks

levels. This was mainly due to the healthy

growth in earnings from computer services,

gradual improvement in earnings from tourism

and improvements in freight related to sea and

air transport services. As a result, the surplus in

the services account amounted to US dollars 1.6

billion in 2021 compared to US dollars 0.8 billion

in 2020.

Travel and Tourism

The tourism industry, which was severely

affected by the COVID-19 pandemic,

witnessed a steady recovery in the latter

part of 2021 aided by effective measures

taken by relevant authorities along with the

improved global perception of Sri Lanka as

a safe travel destination. Since the reopening

to foreign travellers in January 2021, Sri Lanka

saw a steady increase in international travellers,

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

despite intermittent lockdowns. This enabled the

tourism sector to implement and improve its health

and safety protocols, which have proven to be

effective. Following the temporary restrictions in

April 2021, due to the emergence of the third wave

of the pandemic, Sri Lanka was reopened in June

2021 for fully vaccinated travellers with quarantine

free entry. As a result of these measures along

with the successful domestic vaccination rollout,

international tourist arrivals started to pick

up steadily from September 2021 to peak in

December 2021 with 89,506 arrivals. In support

of the recovery of the tourism sector, authorities

implemented several measures such as revising

codes of conduct, which specified health and

safety regulations for all tourist enterprises and

tourist services and upgrading the health and

safety guidelines. The tourism sector was also

provided with extended moratorium on its debt

payable to the financial sector until such time

they are able to recover from the set-backs they

experienced since 2019. Tourist arrivals declined

by 61.7 per cent to 194,495 in 2021 compared to

507,704 in 2020, of which 507,311 arrivals were

recorded during the first three months of 2020.

The steady increase in tourist arrivals continued

during early 2022 despite the disruptions to global

tourism caused by geo-political tensions.

Europe was the dominant region for

tourist arrivals, while India continued to

be the dominant single country for tourist

arrivals. About 93,496 arrivals were recorded

from Europe, accounting for 48 per cent of total

tourist arrivals. The Asia Pacific region recorded

the second highest arrivals in 2021 with 83,926

tourists, accounting for 43.2 per cent of total

tourist arrivals, despite the very low number of

travellers from China. In terms of tourist arrivals

by individual countries, India maintained its lead

with 56,268 arrivals during 2021 followed by

Russia, the UK, Germany, and Pakistan. In late

August 2021, Sri Lanka resumed its tourism

campaign in India, opening its borders to fully

vaccinated travellers. Russia surpassed the UK

as the second largest tourist destination in 2021

due to tourism promotion programmes carried out

targeting charter flights from Russia, suggesting

that enhanced connectivity through regular routes

and seasonal charter flight operations could be

promoted as a means to attract tourists from both

traditional and non-traditional markets. In 2021,

the top five tourist source destinations accounted

for 56.4 per cent of total tourist arrivals in Sri

Lanka.

While there was an increase in both average

spending per tourist and the duration of stay,

earnings from tourism was moderate in 2021

compared to the previous year as a result

of reduced tourist arrivals. As per the revised

estimates on tourist spending and duration of stay

for 2021 by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development

Authority (SLTDA), the average spending per

tourist in 2021 rose to US dollars 172.6 per day

from US dollars 158.1 per day in 2020. Further, the

average duration of stay by a tourist was estimated

to be at 15.1 days in 2021, in comparison to 8.5

days in 2020, reflecting the impact of quarantine

due to COVID-19 restrictions. Earnings from

tourism decreased by 25.7 per cent to US dollars

507 million in 2021, in comparison to US dollars 682

million in 2020. Meanwhile, limited outflows related

to travel were also recorded in 2021 compared to

2020.

Investment in the tourism sector expanded

further in 2021, indicating the continuous

confidence of investors in Sri Lanka’s tourism

potential. The Investor Relations Unit (IRU) of the

SLTDA received 45 new investment projects related

to the tourism sector amounting to US dollars 134

million in 2021, with a collective capacity of 1,328

rooms. Meanwhile, IRU granted approvals for 30

tourism related projects during 2021 amounting to

US dollars 104 million, with a collective capacity

of 922 rooms. In addition, 87 hotel projects with

6,265 rooms are currently under construction at

various levels. Accordingly, graded establishments

amounting to 480 with a total capacity of 25,958

rooms and supplementary establishments,

including boutique villas, bungalows, guest houses,

heritage bungalows, heritage homes, home

stay units, rented apartments and rented homes

amounting to 3,177 with a total capacity of 21,379

rooms were in operation in 2021.

The Government and the private sector

jointly implemented several policy initiatives

and various promotional programmes to attract

tourists in 2021. The debt moratoria in relation

to the tourism sector granted by Licensed Banks,

Licensed Finance Companies and Specialised

Leasing Companies at the request of the Central

Bank in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,

was in place until 31 March 2021, and further

extended until 01 October 2021. However, in view

of the lasting adverse effects of the pandemic on

the industry, the Central Bank extended the debt

moratoria again for another nine months ending in

July 2022. In line with this extension, moratoria on

lease rentals of business and private sector vehicles

providing passenger transport services to the

tourism sector were also extended. Furthermore,

the Saubagya COVID-19 Renaissance Facility

implemented by the Central Bank to provide loans

at concessionary interest rates to individuals and

businesses in the tourism sector, was extended

several times, until 30 June 2022 on a case by case

basis. In addition, several measures were taken by

the tourism authorities to reduce the burden faced

by stakeholders of the industry, such as extending

the validity period of licenses of all tourism

establishments registered with the SLTDA and

extending the validity of tourist guide licenses until

31 December 2021. The SLTDA, in collaboration

with the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel

Management (SLITHM) introduced an e-learning

platform for continuous professional development

to all registered guides to improve their knowledge

and skills. Further, the SLTDA launched a

membership drive to encourage informal sector

tourism operators to register with the SLTDA. All

informal tourism businesses, including tourist

hotels, guest houses, homestays, bungalows,

travel agencies, tourist-friendly eating places,

restaurants, and spa and wellness centres are

allowed to register through a provisional registration

Introduction

Tourism is defined as “a social, cultural and economic phenomenon which entails the movement of people to countries or places outside their usual environment for personal or business/professional purposes” by the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO). International Tourism (hereinafter referred to as “Tourism”) is basically exportation of services. Tourism earnings and expenditure are recorded as “Travel” under “Services” in the Goods and Services Account of the Balance of Payment (Balance of Payment and International Investment Position Manual - BPM 6 of the International Monetary Fund). Tourism remains an important source of net foreign currency earnings for a country, as the foreign currency outflows on account of inputs are minimal. In addition to earning foreign currency, the tourism industry also contributes to economic growth, employment, and reduction in regional income disparity. Sri Lanka’s strategic location, attractive natural endowments, cultural diversity, and rich history, together with the peaceful, clean, safe and foreigner-friendly environment, provide the basis for this industry to flourish. Therefore, development of the tourism industry will be a key economic priority, particularly in the post-pandemic economic recovery period, to mitigate external sector imbalances in the country.

Significance of Earnings from Tourism for the Economy at Present

Tourism remained the third largest source of foreign currency earnings between 2014 and 2019 and contributed to about 14 per cent of total foreign currency earnings during this period. Although export earnings, which is the largest source of foreign currency earnings, grew from US dollars 8,626 million in 2010 to US dollars 12,499 million in 2021, generation of earnings through such exports needed a considerable amount of import expenditure on account of inputs. However, tourism as a single industry has been able to generate substantial earnings with a relatively low reliance on imports of inputs. For instance, in the peak year of tourism in Sri Lanka, i.e., 2018, earnings from tourism, estimated at US dollars 4,381 million, outnumbered net export earnings of the apparel industry, that is, export earnings net of import expenditure on textiles (US dollars 2,459 million), and export earnings by other key industries such as tea (US dollars 1,428 million) and rubber products (US dollars 875 million). Meanwhile, workers’ remittances, which have been the second largest source of foreign currency earnings, brought an average of US dollars 7,023 million per annum between 2014 and 2019 despite falling to US dollars 5,491 million in 2021. Therefore, tourism is an important source of foreign currency earnings to Sri Lanka and has a key role to play in maintaining the country’s resilience to external sector pressures.

BOX 5The Role of Tourism during Post-Pandemic Recovery in Sri Lanka

Potential of the Tourism Industry

The global tourism industry recorded a steady growth in the recent decades despite setbacks suffered from time to time due to occurrences such as the global financial crisis and outbreaks of epidemics. Tourist arrivals reached 1,468 million by 2019 according to UNWTO. Sri Lanka too saw a continuous increase in tourism arrivals in the past until 2018, with a substantial increase from 2010 when the civil war ended. In fact, in 2018, Sri Lanka was named the top destination for the year 2019 by the acclaimed tourism information provider “Lonely Planet.” However, unfortunately, tourism arrivals in 2019 saw a set back because of the terrorist attacks on Easter Sunday in April 2019, though global tourist arrivals reached the record highest in that year. Despite this setback, tourist arrivals and earnings showed a recovery by end of 2019 and early 2020, before starting to decline again because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile the global tourism industry is expected to record a slow recovery in the forthcoming years. According to a survey conducted by UNWTO in January 2022 among its panel of tourism experts, 63 per cent of respondents expected that international tourist arrivals in their countries will not recover to the 2019 level until 2024, while 79 per cent of the respondents believed that arrivals in the Asia Pacific region will not recover to 2019 levels until 2024. However, UNWTO, World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) and market analysts have shown that there is substantial pent-up savings and a yearning to travel among potential travellers, while tourism characteristics have fundamentally changed because of the pandemic. Therefore, there is a potential for Sri Lanka to attract a substantial number of tourists and/or generate substantial foreign currency earnings from tourism even in 2022 and 2023, if appropriate strategies are implemented efficiently and effectively.

Pandemic and Tourism Response in the Era of “New Normal”

Recognising the importance of supporting the tourism industry, the Government and the Central Bank provided a multitude of relief measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as debt moratoria, concessionary loan schemes, waivers on fees, relief on electricity bills, one-off grants and tax relief measures. Meanwhile, rules were issued by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in January 2022 requiring hotel service providers to accept payments from non-residents only in foreign currency, which will ensure the inflow of foreign currency to the country on account of tourism. This also allows the tourism sector to strengthen its earnings in foreign currency without major capital investments, as the sector has made heavy investments in local and foreign currency. Meanwhile, some small-scale hotels kept afloat by renting hotels as quarantine centres when the industry as a whole suffered a significant setback due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

WTTC has highlighted several new features of the "new normal” or the current trends in global tourism, which should be adapted to (Trending in Travel – Emerging Consumer Trends in Travel & Tourism in 2021 and beyond, November 2021). For example, travellers are skeptic of booking well in advance owing to the sudden changes in restrictions imposed by countries and risks from testing positive for COVID-19. Further, travellers prefer accommodation and transport options that allow sudden cancellations without a penalty. Secondly, due to the normalisation of remote working through the pandemic, concepts such as “digital nomads” and “staycations” have become popular, and travellers seek long duration visa, long duration discounts at places of accommodation, fast internet, and other work-related facilities. International tourism organisations further note that the length of stay and spending on a trip increased in 2021. Thirdly, the profile of travellers has changed with more younger travellers (in their 20s to 40s) opting to travel, rather than older persons or families with small children due to health concerns. Therefore, the tourism industry and the country as a whole should be able to accommodate the needs and preferences of such tourists. This age group values adventure and individualism and they use mobile phones and digital services to plan and book their trips and rely on social media, blogs and online reviews of other travellers. Fourthly, appreciation of the value of mental health and personal wellness has increased notably in the recent past and consumer interest in achieving these needs through travelling has also increased. There is also an interest for “philantourism” where tourists can get involved in philanthropical activities and “ecotourism” to gain knowledge about ecological centres around the world. Fifth, the tendency to go on secondary trips, exploring lesser-known attractions near places of main tourism interests and rural tourism has also increased.

Sri Lankan Tourism: The Way Forward

The Ministry of Tourism and institutions under its purview together with the private sector keep strategising and implementing a plethora of measures to develop tourism infrastructure in the country and promote Sri Lanka in target markets. The tourism strategic action plan 2022-2025 developed by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) provides effective guidance for implementation of actions to upgrade the sector and resolve issues. A comprehensive tourism policy has also been drafted by the Ministry of Tourism and the Cabinet approval is awaited. However, there are certain aspects that require emphasis in policy development and implementation of strategies:

(i) Exploring new drivers of tourism

Sri Lanka has the potential to expand and enhance services in new areas of tourism such as wellness tourism, educational tourism and philanthropical tourism. In the sphere of wellness tourism, opportunities targeted at providing facilities to improve physical and mental well-being, such as peaceful and relaxing stays, retreats, meditation, yoga and Ayurvedic treatments could be expanded. Under educational tourism, short-term or long-term educational programmes in the areas such

as English and South Asian culture and civilisation can be offered at existing or new educational institutions. It is common for East Asians to undertake English Language programmes abroad after graduating from school and such programmes can be offered in Sri Lanka. Exchange programmes and home-stay programmes for foreign students can be encouraged as well. Philanthropical tourism can provide opportunities for foreigners to engage in philanthropical activities such as charity work and agricultural work in the country.

(ii) Greater importance of preserving and protecting the natural environment and pollution reduction.

There is a strong and growing interest towards conservation of nature and eco-friendliness among world travellers as given in various UNWTO and WTTC publications as well as communications from the Sri Lankan hotel sector. Sri Lankan authorities have a greater role in ensuring that construction of places of tourist accommodation does not destroy nature or scenic views for others (such as hotels at the edge of beaches) and does not result in encroachment of forests and other protected areas hidden from the public eye. Further, noise pollution near attractions and places of accommodation should be managed. Supervising practices that tourism service providers are engaged in are environmentally friendly (for example, whale watching tours disturbing whales) is also important. Also, the recently enacted Animal Welfare Act should be made of use to reduce the negative publicity that was created due to the treatment of elephants and wild animals, leopards in particular.

(iii) Focus on the individual tourist’s journey

SLTDA conducts a survey among departing tourists mostly on a yearly basis. In the 2018-2019 survey report, it is stated that only 17 per cent of tourists used package-tours showing that tourists plan their own trips to a great extent. Further, 60 per cent of surveyed tourists had obtained travel information from friends and relatives and 30 per cent from online sources, highlighting the importance of personal recommendations and personal online reviews. These findings underscore the importance of satisfying each individual tourist and the impact individuals can make on publicity. Further, the general satisfaction level is moderate, since only 60 per cent of the tourists stated that their stay was “excellent” and only 36 per cent of the tourists stated that they want to visit Sri Lanka again. Even the seemingly minute inconveniences to tourists can destroy their entire experience and ignite negative publicity affecting the whole tourism industry.

(iv) Greater use of digital technology

There is scope to enhance the use of digital technologies to improve tourist experience and transition from high-density to socially-distanced tourism. Although some steps have been taken in this direction such as the SLTDA website and the tourism mobile app (being developed), enhanced measures to use digital technology are necessary, expeditiously. UNWTO and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in “COVID-19 and the future of tourism in the Asia and Pacific” (March 2022) also point out the expanding role of digital technology in tourism.

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

In Sri Lanka, tourism is concentrated in the Western, Southern, and Central Provinces and the Sigiriya region. Crowding in National Parks have gathered considerable negative publicity lately. Meanwhile, even the ancient cities of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa do not attract a significant number of tourists (Table 86 of the Statistical Appendix). Other areas of the country provide ideal locations to conduct wellness, rural, philanthropical, adventure tourism etc. and tourists should be directed to attractions in these areas. Meanwhile, tourists are compelled to go through inconveniences such as buying tickets at individual tourism sites and not having updated information online about events (such as “Peraharas” and festivals, even the small-scale ones), public transport, security services, dress code at religious sites, prohibited items in national parks, etc. Therefore, incorporation of such information and the facility to purchase customised ticket bundles as per individual preference to the mobile app being developed or to a website dedicated to tourists will be highly beneficial. Digital technologies can also be used to provide touchless service delivery methods, QR Code based contactless payment options and to store and share health and safety information.

(v) Improving information to exploit the potential of tourism for better policy making

Appropriate policy decision making rests on a sound information network. Given the intense competition among countries to attract tourists and the evolving nature of tourist characteristics, use of a strong information network for policy decisions is pivotal. The “Tourism Satellite Accounting” initiative that the Department of Census and Statistics is implementing with the support of UNWTO will enable better estimation of the economic contribution of tourism to National Accounts. Hence, its implementation needs to be fast tracked. In addition, high frequency data on a multitude of other aspects is necessary, such as characteristics of persons arriving under tourist visas, how much they are spending and for what and where, satisfaction level, employment in tourism, number and types of direct and indirect tourism service providers and various spatial information. The need for national tourism authorities to enhance their market research capabilities to improve the customer journey, trigger innovation and offer insights to the private sector has been highlighted in multi-country studies conducted during the pandemic by the International Monetary Fund as well. (Tourism in the Post-Pandemic World: Economic Challenges and Opportunities for Asia-Pacific and the Western Hemisphere, International Monetary Fund, 2021).

(vi) Improving risk management capabilities of the tourism sector

Since tourism is inherently an industry that is highly susceptible to geo-political events and is seasonal, the sector should enhance its own risk management capabilities rather than relying solely on concessions such as debt moratoria and fiscal handouts. Debt moratoria reduce incomes of banks, affect their liquidity, and increase risks. An adverse outcome on the banking sector can have ripple effects on the entire economy.

(vii) Reducing informal sub-sector within the sector

The tourism sector in Sri Lanka is characterised by a large number of Micro, Small and Medium scale enterprises (MSMEs), carrying out their businesses informally. However, encouraging such enterprises to register with authorities will help to ensure that strategies the Government is implementing are streamlined and relief measures, if needed, are provided equitably to all participants. Also, high informality in an industry constrains information collection for policy decision-making purposes, delivery of Government services and regulation for quality standards. Registration of businesses will improve access to finance and tax collection as well.

(viii) Encourage diversity among tourists

Facilities should be aimed at satisfying diverse types of travellers in terms of their interest, country of origin and spending capacity, rather than targeting high net worth individuals only. This will help to reduce reliance on travellers with specific characteristics or from a single country/region. In fact, all types of travellers contribute towards positive marketing of Sri Lanka. Catering to tourists of different spending capacities will enable local entities with different investment capabilities to function in the industry as well.

(ix) Reducing over-reliance on tourism

The International Monetary Fund (IMF), in “Tourism in the Post-Pandemic World - Economic Challenges and Opportunities for Asia-Pacific and the Western Hemisphere” (2021), notes that countries that are dependent on tourism are in fact small in size, have inadequate foreign exchange revenue and buffers, limited fiscal space and other macroeconomic vulnerabilities. Incidentally, over-reliance on tourism is a feature of countries that have been less successful in other exports and are suffering from such features. Such tourism-dependent countries have a relatively low level of export complexity that affects their options for new product development. Development of new products requires the expansion of the productive knowledge and capacities. Tourism is not an industry that enhances the technological capacity of a country and is highly vulnerable to external shocks. In the aforementioned publication, the IMF shows the prudence of tourism-dependent countries (which includes Sri Lanka) to nurture other goods and services export sectors using new digital economy tools or focus on overall export development. As suggested in this report, in the medium-term, Sri Lanka should re-think its tourism model and undertake necessary structural reforms.

Conclusion

It is expected that the tourism sector will provide an impetus for post-pandemic recovery of the Sri Lankan economy despite the impact of geo-political tensions and the challenging domestic socio-political environment. Concerted efforts by the Government and the private sector to create, and not just adapt to, a new normal would be necessary. In this endeavour, travel advisories issued by some governments based

on the recent economic situation of Sri Lanka have to be countered by Sri Lankan authorities through better engagement. The recovery in the industry will depend on how well it will cater to the needs of the modern traveller, preparedness to possible supply and energy shortages, and sound management of finances in post-moratorium stages. From a marketing perspective, there is further potential for attracting tourists for diversified interests such as meditation and younger groups for medical and historical research. Both SLTDA and private tour operators need to encourage these specific groups of tourists to visit Sri Lanka offering attractive packages compared to peers in the region. With the waning of the pandemic, it is expected that the tourism sector could play a significant role in the economic revival of Sri Lanka.

process. Meanwhile, several strategic efforts were

taken to promote the country to attract a worldwide

audience, focusing on novel areas. In this regard,

the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTPB)

launched a five-year global communication

campaign in March 2021 and initiated the promotion

of film tourism for Indian cinema in October 2021.

Moreover, the World Expo 2020, which was held

from 1 October 2021 until 31 March 2022 in Dubai,

provided an opportunity for Sri Lanka to promote

trade, investment, and tourism. In 2021, several

new themes were added to Sri Lanka tourism for

the first time, such as the digital nomads initiative

and the digital program 'Go on a Couch Safari' that

livestreamed wildlife in Sri Lanka to enhance online

engagement. Aggressive tourism promotions led

Sri Lanka to achieve several accolades from world

renowned tourism organisations as one of the best

destinations to travel during 2021 by Condé Nast,

Travel and Leisure magazine, CNN travel, etc. and

it ranked as a top destination for wellness tourism

and ranked second in Women Solo Travel Index.

Transport, Telecommunications, Computer and Information Services and Other Services

The IT/BPO sector performed well during

2021 surpassing the US dollar 1 billion mark.

Freight transport services recorded a positive

growth in 2021 after significant disruptions

to sea freight transport services in 2020 due

to the pandemic. Although ship traffic to the

country’s ports declined marginally in 2021,

there was a notable increase in total container

handling including domestic container handling,

transshipments and restowing operations. Total

cargo handled in terms of cargo loaded and cargo

discharged also increased during the year. This

was coupled with higher global cargo handling

rates, resulting in higher freight related charges for

both imports and exports of the country. Meanwhile,

there was a notable reduction in earnings from air

passenger services due to the decline in tourist

arrivals with the pandemic. Passenger services

outflows also reduced as a result of constrained

travel opportunities for Sri Lankans to travel in

non-resident airlines owing to the pandemic. Other

services subsectors, including financial services,

construction services, government services and

other business services recorded modest net

outflows in 2021. Accordingly, the surplus in the

services account increased to US dollars 1.6 billion

in 2021, compared to US dollars 0.8 billion in 2020.

However, the surplus levels in the services account

in 2020 and 2021 were significantly low compared to

pre-Easter Sunday attacks level, mainly due to lower

earnings from tourism.

5.2.3 Primary Income

The primary income account deficit

recorded a contraction in 2021, as a result of the

reduced interest payments on foreign loans,

coupon payments on account of investments

in government securities and dividend

payments of DIEs, despite an increase in

reinvested earnings of DIEs. Interest payments

on foreign loans of the Government, private

sector and the state owned business enterprises

(SOBEs) declined during the year, while interest

payments by deposit taking corporations to non-

residents recorded a modest increase during the

year. A decline in interest payments of foreign

loans of the Government was observed, with

the Government gradually moving to low cost

concessional funding, while some short term

commercial loans were gradually being paid off.

Further, there was a significant decline in coupon

payments of international sovereign bonds (ISBs)

to non-residents due to the change in a part of the

ownership of ISBs from non-residents to residents

as well as due to the maturity of ISBs in 2020

and 2021, with no new issuances. However, an

increase in reinvested earnings was observed in

2021 compared to 2020. Meanwhile, inflows to the

primary income account declined, primarily due

to the decrease in investment income on account

of international reserves in 2021. With these

developments, the deficit in the primary income

account is estimated to be US dollars 2.0 billion in

2021, compared to US dollars 2.2 billion in 2020.

5.2.4 Secondary Income

The secondary income account weakened

as a result of the moderation in workers’

remittances in 2021. Workers’ remittances, which

recorded a healthy growth in the first five months of

2021 recorded a gradual decline from June 2021

onwards. This resulted in a decline of workers’

remittances of 22.7 per cent in 2021 compared

to a growth of 5.8 per cent recorded in 2020. The

decline could primarily be attributed to the reduction

in remittances received through official channels

due to the notable difference in the exchange rate

which prevailed in the grey market compared to the

official rate. With these developments, net inflows

to the secondary income account decreased to US

dollars 5.2 billion in 2021 compared to US dollars 6.2

billion in 2020. A notable recovery in remittances is

expected in 2022 with the sharp depreciation in the

exchange rate since March 2022, together with the

increasing number of migrant workers leaving for

foreign employment. In order to facilitate workers’

remittances through the banking sector, the Central

Bank established a new department named the

‘Foreign Remittances Facilitation Department’ while

also introducing a number of incentive schemes

for workers remitting money through the banking

sector. Further, a mobile application to facilitate

the convenient transfer of remittances named

‘Lanka Remit’ was launched by LankaClear with the

participation of most Licensed Commercial Banks

(LCBs). A temporary monetary incentive above the

official exchange rate was provided for remittances

converted into rupees while several other incentive

schemes are in the pipeline to be introduced to

promote workers’ remittances focusing on improved

welfare of migrant workers and their families.

5.3 Capital Account Balance

Net inflows to the capital account remained

broadly unchanged in 2021. Capital transfers to

the Government reduced, while those to the private

sector recorded an increase in 2021, compared

to the previous year. Consequently, the capital

account recorded a surplus of US dollars 25 million

in 2021 compared to a surplus of US dollars 28

million recorded in 2020.

Introduction

Efficient and safe movement of funds within a country and across the borders is an important component of the financial system of a country. This is more important for cross border transfers where foreign exchange is involved. Usually, a vast majority of these transactions occur through formal channels. However, in any economy, in varying sizes, there exist informal money transfer channels mainly for cross border transactions. The extent of informal channels and the use of formal channels by money remitters depends on the characteristics of a particular economy and financial market and the legitimacy of such transactions. Formal channels consist of the services provided by licensed and regulated entities such as financial institutions. Informal channels consist of participants of the unregulated markets such as Hawala, Hundi or Undiyal (in South Asia), Fei Qian or Chit (in South East Asia) and Black-market Peso (in European countries) service providers who have not been licensed to perform money remittance services in several countries. However, at present, certain countries with informal money transfer channels such as Germany, United Kingdom and United States of America pursue regulatory approaches in registration and licensing such service providers along with imposing anti-money laundering requirements. Hawala channels have been continuously used in moving the value of money from one place to another, without the physical movement of funds, since ancient times, when there were no formal banking channels. However, such informal channels still exist today, even though banking transactions have been made ultra-easy, as convenient as effecting by using a mobile app. These informal remitting services are used for legitimate as well as illegitimate purposes by various individuals, groups and entities. Such services are heavily exploited for criminal activities, even including laundering of money and financing of terrorism. For instance, Hawala channels were used to finance the activities that led to the deadly terrorist attack on the US World Trade Centre in 2001. Some favourable characteristics such as low cost of transactions, easy access, less paperwork, and quick transfers make these channels popular among remitters. However, being an informal business with the involvement of possible criminal activities, the possibility of losing money makes them a risky channel. Most importantly, these channels are highly vulnerable to misuse by money launderers and terrorist financiers. These types of informal and illegitimate payment channels could be detrimental to the smooth functioning of financial systems and economic activity of a country, as they move economic resources from the formal sector to the informal sector of an economy. This article intends to shed light on the adverse impacts of informal money remittance channels on financial systems and the economy of a country. Since all these informal remittance channels have more or less the same characteristics, the article will focus on the mainly used channel in Sri Lanka, namely Hawala,

BOX 6The Impact of Informal Money Transfers on Financial Markets and the Economy

and refer to it as Hawala channels or informal channels alternatively.

Introduction to Hawala Transactions

These remitting channels work as network arrangements and can be sometimes found within a particular community in the society. In these arrangements, the value transfers are facilitated by agents belonging to these networks who are located all over the world. In the Hawala channels, the Hawala agents or dealers (also known as Hawala Dars) live in different countries and settlements of transactions occur completely based on trust. An agent in one country collects money from people who need to send money to another country and the agent in that particular country settles those amounts to the intended recipients in the currency they desire. Accordingly, there is no physical cash movement across the borders, no financial institutions are involved in cross border transactions, and no transactions are properly recorded under these channels. However, financial institutions may be involved in the event domestic fund transfers are required.

Users of Hawala Channels

Hawala is used for both legitimate as well as illegitimate purposes by different economic agents. These include, a) foreign workers remitting money for families in their native countries, b) traders paying funds for goods imported and receiving funds for goods exported, c) parents transferring funds for their children’s foreign education, d) people who live in areas with less developed banking channels that provide remittance services, e) migrants without proper visa remitting funds and, f) illegitimate users such as money launderers and terrorist financiers.

Main Features of Hawala Channels

Hawala and informal channels have special features, which make these remitting channels attractive for users. Some of those features are as follows. Accessibility: informal channels have subtly penetrated every corner of the world and made their way into most economic activities including remote areas where formal banking facilities are limited or not available. Affordability: charges associated with fund remittances through formal banking channels are expensive when compared to the commissions involved in Hawala. Also, usually, the exchange rate offered by Hawala agents is more attractive than that of authorised dealers in foreign exchange. Speed: there are no cross border movements of currency in these informal channels and the amount equivalent to the foreign currency value is locally settled either by depositing funds to an account of the recipient or by settling in cash. In some instances, the recipients receive the money within a couple of hours and some have the option to receive money to their doorstep upon revealing the password to the respective Hawala agent. Convenience: these informal arrangements are

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

convenient from the remitter’s perspective as in countries where there are many expatriate Sri Lankan workers, such as Kuwait, South Korea and the Maldives, these agents possess mechanisms to collect salaries from the workers at the work premises itself, for the purpose of sending it to their families. Possible anonymity: this is the most appealing feature of Hawala. No paper or documentary proof is required for these arrangements. Hence, it is an indirect invitation for people who need to maintain secrecy in their transactions. Further, the legitimacy of the source of funds is not questioned by service providers since these agents are not subject to any regulatory supervision. In general, the more exchange and monetary restrictions and controls, the higher would be Hawala and Undial activities as customers in the formal sector also tend to patronize these services.

Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Through Hawala Channels

Informal money remitting channels provide a convenient platform for illegal money transfers through money laundering and terrorist financing activities. Money laundering is simply the conversion of money generated from illicit crimes into legally accepted money. The process of money laundering involves the following three steps. The first step is the placement where proceeds of the illicit crime are placed in the financial channel, i.e., in bank accounts. The second step is layering, which involves a series of transactions involved to conceal the origin of the proceeds of the illicit crime. The final step is integration where proceeds of the illicit crime are absorbed into the economy. Terrorist financing is the act of funding terrorist activities and/or organisations. The source of financing terrorism can be legal or illegal. Continuous inflows to backup terrorist activities are a must to continue the agendas of terrorist groups. Hence, different avenues are misused by terrorists for their funding needs.

There are several ways in which Hawala channels support money laundering and terrorist financing. The absence of a regulatory framework to control and identify any drawbacks and negative consequences of these channels is one of the key factors making them vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing. The absence of proper record retention procedures by these agents is another supportive factor. Compared to the banking sector, the lack of attention to the source and use of funds during these transactions also encourage money launderers and terrorist financiers. The difficulty to initiate legal proceedings is another notable feature.

Risks of Using Informal Channels

Many innocent people get caught in law enforcement investigations as a result of their choice to use Hawala channels to transfer funds arising from otherwise lawful and legitimate transactions. Hawala does not often utilise any sort of negotiable instrument or wire transfer. Instead, transfers of money take place based on communications between members of Hawala dealers. Hence, there is no way to prove the transaction and there is a high possibility of losing all the hard earned money that needs to be transferred. Sometimes Hawala dealers are directly or indirectly involved in criminal activities

such as fraud and drug trafficking to balance books. Hence, there is a high possibility of law enforcement agencies investigating Hawala dealers. In such an instance, people who innocently or unknowingly use Hawala channels may also be inquired by authorities.

Impact of Hawala on Financial Markets, the Economy and the Country

Informal cross border transactions could have negative impacts on financial markets, the economy and the national security of a country. Following are some of the main areas that could have an impact by having sizeable informal cross border channels:

Lower Tax Income

Hawala channels allow individuals or entities to transfer money through informal channels, thus facilitating tax evasion. The government incurs losses from direct taxes in the form of income, taxes as well as indirect taxes related to such transactions. Since the transactions carried out through Hawala channels are not being recorded, and due to the unavailability of such information to the local tax authorities, the income of the parties involved in the transactions along with the income of Hawala agents are excluded from the tax income of a country. Further, indirect taxes relating to transactions carried out through formal systems, such as registration fees and other service taxes are avoided, thereby negatively affecting government income. Hawala transactions are also used by importers and exporters of a country for the purpose of avoiding taxation on goods. For example, an importer could request the overseas exporter to underquote the invoices thereby reducing the tax to be paid to the government by the importer. The difference between the actual cost and the invoiced cost could then be settled through Hawala channels, which would be unnoticed by the tax authorities.

Impact on Balance of Payments (BOP) and Foreign Reserves of a Country

Workers’ remittances have become a significant component in foreign inflows and the balance of payments in emerging economies like Sri Lanka. When workers remit foreign earnings through informal channels such as Hawala, such earnings are not reflected in the calculation of BOP. This is relevant to several other components reported in BOP, such as merchandise trade. Accordingly, BOP statistics will not reflect the true position of the external sector of a country. Further, since foreign reserves of a country are accumulated through the transfer of funds via formal channels, Hawala transfers will not help in building up foreign reserves of a country, in fact, it could deplete reserves due to the possible switch between formal and informal channels.

Impact on Money Supply

The direct effect on broad money of an economy is almost zero for Hawala transactions as there is no physical movement of cash. However, the composition of broad money of the recipient country can be affected by Hawala transactions due to the cash centric nature

Recent Actions Taken against the Hawala Channels

Efforts to contain the expansion of Hawala channels in the island were strengthened in 2021, in view of the severe threats they pose to the economy, as discussed earlier. Public awareness sessions, including newspaper advertisements and articles, to increase the level of understanding of the public on the risk of Hawala type transactions, were conducted. Funds of accounts involved in such transactions were seized until investigations into their possible connections with unlawful activities are concluded. Further, financial incentives such as offering extra rupees to encourage foreign workers to remit their earnings through formal channels such as banks and other financial institutions were introduced. Moreover, other incentives such as retirement benefits and loan facilities for foreign remitters were also proposed with a view to promoting formal remittance channels and discouraging the use of informal channels.

Way Forward

The existence of Hawala channels poses a great risk to the global economy and the threat of vast expansion of these channels has been addressed by different countries by employing varied tactics. In India, Hawala transactions are restricted by prohibiting the making of any payment to any person outside India without conditional approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In addition, the RBI has implemented actions to enhance the quality of formal financial services such as establishing branches of commercial banks in rural areas to access the formal financial sector and permitted the non-bank financial sector to access Money Transfer Service Schemes to contain the impact of Hawala channels. Subsequently, the Indian Government enacted The Financial Exchange Management Act in the 1970s. Pakistan took steps towards the transformation of money changers to foreign exchange companies in which they were given a two year period to register and comply. The publication made by the Financial Action Task Force titled The Role of Hawala and other Similar Service Providers in ML/TF in 2013, clearly explains strategies to identify unregulated Hawala and other similar service providers and possible avenues to create incentives to formalise their business. At present, authorities plan to pursue steps to implement an appropriate legal framework to monitor and legalise Hawala channels in Sri Lanka.

of the transactions as there could be a decline in bank deposit accounts (savings and time deposits) in favor of cash transactions. The negative impact of Hawala channels on the banking sector and the development of a cash economy which could create instability of demand for money would limit financial intermediation and affect monetary transmission mechanisms causing inefficiency in monetary policy.

Impact on Financial Intermediation

The leakage of money from the banking system could constrain the availability of banking resources. It could also cause an increase in market interest rates when banks attempt to attract deposits by offering higher interest rates. Further, the essential functions of financial intermediation are threatened by alternative informal money transfer channels. Banks may also lose their market share due to an increase in the Hawala network.

Impact on National Security

The existence of informal channels is a challenge for national security agencies since several large terrorist attacks in the world have been partially funded by such channels. Hawala is a form of underground banking method, which is considered a threat to the effectiveness of the fight against terrorist financing since certain sources of terrorist financing are channeled through informal mechanisms. Accordingly, every effort should be made to stop expanding these channels and to stop terrorists using Hawala channels.

Sri Lanka and Hawala Channels

The Growth of Informal Money Transfer Channels

It has been observed that workers’ remittances in Sri Lanka fell notably in 2021 mainly due to fewer worker departures for foreign countries during the pandemic and the expansion of Hawala channels due to large exchange rate differentials between the formal market and the grey market. Migrant workers have been incentivised to switch to Hawala channels by the premium paid on the foreign exchange conversion rate by Hawala agents. The drastic drop in workers’ remittances in 2021 negatively affected the BOP position in Sri Lanka. It has been reported that Sri Lankan importers too use Hawala channels to pay their import bills because of the shortage of foreign currency supply in formal channels arising from exchange rate differentials even though the use of Hawala channels to obtain foreign currency is expensive. Overall, the popularity of Hawala channels in recent times has deprived the country from receiving crucial flows of foreign currency through formal channels, thus dampening the supply of foreign exchange, and shrinking foreign currency reserves creating BOP concerns. Thus, the expansion of Hawala channels poses a significant threat to the BOP position in Sri Lanka. However, if formal channels can continuously maintain a competitive exchange rate based on market demand and supply, the demand for informal remittance channels is expected to be contained, as the exchange rate differential is expected to reduce substantially.

5.4 Financial Account

In the financial account of the BOP, the net

incurrence of liabilities increased while the net

acquisition of assets recorded a significant

reduction during 2021. The net incurrence of

liabilities recorded an increase of US dollars 1.9

billion in 2021 compared to a reduction of US

dollars 1.7 billion in 2020. Reflecting the continued

uncertainty driven by the COVID-19 pandemic as well

as domestic circumstances, FDIs including foreign

loans to DIEs remained modest in 2021, similar to

the previous year. As a result, FDIs, including foreign

loans to DIEs, amounted to US dollars 784 million

in 2021, in comparison to US dollars 670 million

in 2020. Further, FDIs, excluding foreign loans to

DIEs, amounted to US dollars 598 million in 2021,

in comparison to US dollars 434 million recorded

in 2020. On a sector wise basis, major FDIs were

received by projects related to telecommunications,

property development, textiles and hotels sectors,

while such FDIs were primarily received by already

established DIEs. Despite the moderation in FDIs

in 2021, going forward, FDIs are anticipated to

materialise particularly to the Colombo Port City and

the Hambantota port project. Further, efforts are also

underway to monetise underutilised assets under

the Urban Development Authority, which will also

contribute to the FDI flows to the country.

The main financial inflows to the Government

during 2021 included the receipt of two foreign

currency term financing facilities from the China

Development Bank (CDB) in April and September

2021 totalling around US dollars 810 million. In

addition, investments in the form of debt securities,

which mainly consist of foreign investments in ISBs

and rupee denominated government securities,

recorded a net outflow of US dollars 670 million in

2021. This was due to the net impact of the maturity

of an ISB of US dollars 1.0 billion in July 2021, of

which, US dollars 700 million was owed to non-

residents, net sales of foreign investment in the

rupee denominated government securities market

and net purchases related to Sri Lanka’s ISBs made

by non-residents from the secondary market during

the year. The Central Bank received a quantum of

inflows, including the receipt of the SDR allocation

from the IMF in August 2021 (around US dollars 787

million), and the proceeds from the bilateral currency

swap facility with the Bangladesh Bank in August and

September 2021 (US dollars 200 million). Further,

the Central Bank entered into a bilateral swap facility

equivalent to approximately US dollars 1.5 billion

with the PBOC in March 2021, which was activated

in December 2021. Further, during the year, the

Central Bank settled a swap facility with the RBI

amounting to US dollars 400 million that was obtained

in 2020. Meanwhile, financial inflows to the private

sector remained modest in 2021. As such, portfolio

investments in the form of equity, which consist of

foreign residents’ investments in the Colombo Stock

Exchange (CSE), other than direct investment

transactions, recorded a net outflow of US dollars

236 million in 2021, compared to a net outflow of

US dollars 217 million in 2020. Further, foreign loan

inflows to the private sector and SOBEs also recorded

a modest net outflow in 2021. Meanwhile, in terms of

foreign inflows to the banking sector, currency and

deposits recorded a significant net increase, while

there was notable net settlements of short term

foreign loan liabilities of the banking sector. The net

incurrence of liabilities of trade credit and advances

declined, primarily due to net settlements of oil bills

by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation as a result of

lower demand for fuel during the pandemic periods.

Further, other accounts payable, mainly consisting of

Asian Clearing Union (ACU) liabilities managed by

the Central Bank, recorded a net increase in 2021.

Net acquisition of financial assets recorded

a significant reduction, reflecting the decline in

gross official reserves in 2021. Net acquisition of

financial assets declined by US dollars 2.1 billion in

2021, mainly due to the reduction in foreign assets of

the Central Bank. Gross official reserves declined by

US dollars 2.5 billion during the year due to sizeable

foreign debt service payments of the Government,

honouring of maturing liabilities of the Central Bank

as well as the significant supply of foreign exchange

by the Central Bank to facilitate imports of essential

items including fuel, LP gas, coal, medicine and

essential food items, particularly during the latter

part of 2021. However, net acquisition of assets in

the form of currency and deposits of deposit taking

corporations and the net acquisition of assets on

trade credit and advances, which represents trade

credit and advances given by Sri Lankan exporters

to their overseas trading partners, increased during

the year while other accounts receivable of LCBs

recorded a net decrease during the year.

5.5 Overall Balance

The overall balance of the BOP, which

represents the change in net international

reserves, continued to record a significant

deficit in 2021. Gross official reserves declined

notably in 2021, due to the continued moderation of

inflows to the financial account, substantial external

debt service payments and net sales to the domestic

foreign exchange market by the Central Bank during

the year. Consequently, net international reserves

recorded a deficit by end 2021, resulting in the

overall balance also recording a deficit of around US

dollars 4.0 billion in 2021, compared to a deficit of

US dollars 2.3 billion in 2020.

5.6 International Investment Position

In terms of the International Investment

Position (IIP), Sri Lanka’s external liability

position increased, while the external asset

position declined by end 2021 from end 2020.

Accordingly, the country’s external liability position

increased to US dollars 64.5 billion at end 2021

from US dollars 58.6 billion at end 2020, while the

country’s external asset position declined to US

dollars 8.8 billion at end 2021 from US dollars 10.9

billion reported at end 2020. Consequently, the net

liability position of the IIP increased to US dollars

55.7 billion at end 2021 from US dollars 47.7 billion

at end 2020.

Sri Lanka’s external asset position with

non-residents recorded a significant decline

during 2021. The stock position of external assets

decreased primarily due to the decline in gross

official reserves from US dollars 5.7 billion as at

end 2020 to US dollars 3.1 billion at end 2021.1

Meanwhile, the direct investment asset position that

represents direct investments abroad by Sri Lankan

residents increased marginally during the year.

The asset position of deposit taking corporations in

the form of currency and deposits increased, while

other accounts receivable recorded a decrease.

Meanwhile, the outstanding asset position of trade

credit and advances given to non-residents by

the private sector increased by end 2021 from the

position observed at end 2020.

Sri Lanka’s total liability position to non-

residents, as reflected in the IIP, also increased

significantly by end 2021. This is mainly due to

the increase in direct investment liabilities, increase

in currency and deposit liabilities of the Central

Bank and deposit taking corporations as well as

the increase in liabilities resulting from the SDR

allocation. The liability position of outstanding direct

investments in the form of equity increased by about

US dollars 4.0 billion due to substantial valuation

gains in a few major equity positions of non-resident

companies listed in the CSE. These equity gains

were prominent in some companies in particular,

as the equity position increased substantially from

the beginning of the year, resulting in significant

valuation gains for these non-resident investors

by the end of 2021. Further, the Central Bank’s

currency and deposits liability position increased

by end 2021, as a combined effect of entering into

new bilateral currency swap arrangements with

PBOC amounting to CNY 10 billion (equivalent to

around US dollars 1.5 billion) and the Bangladesh

Bank (US dollars 200 million) and the settlement of

the SAARCFINANCE swap facility with the RBI (US

dollars 400 million) during the year. Meanwhile, the

currency and deposits liability position of the deposit

taking corporations also increased by end 2021.

Further, the SDR liability position also increased

by end 2021 with the new allocation of SDR by

the IMF of around US dollars 787 million during

the year. However, the portfolio investment liability

position declined by end 2021 compared to that of

end 2020, mainly with the repayment of the maturing

ISB during the year and the decline in market prices

of outstanding Government ISBs. The foreign loan

liability position of the IIP also declined by end

2021, mainly contributed by the reduction in foreign

loan liabilities of the Central Bank and deposit

taking corporations. Nevertheless, the foreign loan

liability position of the Government recorded an

increase mainly in view of the two foreign currency

term financing facilities obtained during the year.

Further, outstanding trade credits received by Sri

Lankan importers decreased, while the outstanding

position of other accounts payable increased, with

an increase in ACU related liabilities of the Central

Bank during 2021.

5.6.1 Reserve Asset Position

Gross official reserves (GOR) declined to

US dollars 3.1 billion by end 2021 compared

to US dollars 5.7 billion recorded at end 2020.

The decline in GOR was a combined result of

significant foreign currency debt service payments

and the Central Bank intervention in the domestic

foreign exchange market, in view of moderate

foreign exchange inflows during the year. Major

inflows that helped replenish GOR during the

year included two foreign currency term financing

facilities of around US dollars 810 million from

the CDB, SDR allocation of approximately US

dollars 787 million by the IMF and bilateral

currency swap facilities with the PBOC of around

US dollars 1.5 billion (CNY 10 billion) and with

the Bangladesh Bank of US dollars 200 million.

However, the substantial foreign currency debt

service payments, including the repayment of

maturing ISB (US dollars 1.0 billion), principal

and interest payments related to foreign project

loans and foreign currency term financing facilities

(US dollars 2.2 billion), capital and interest

payments for Sri Lanka Development Bonds

(SLDBs) and the loans from Offshore Banking

Units (OBUs) (US dollars 2.3 billion), and the

Central Bank’s intervention in the domestic foreign

exchange market by way of supplying foreign

exchange to finance essential import bills, mainly

contributed to the decline in the GOR level during

the year. The end year GOR level was equivalent

to 1.8 months of imports (4.2 months of imports in

2020) and 23 per cent of the country’s short term

debt and liabilities on remaining maturity basis (43

per cent in 2020). Meanwhile, total international

reserves, which comprise both GOR and foreign

assets of the banking sector, also declined towards

end 2021 mainly due to the decline in official

reserves, although holdings of foreign assets of

deposit taking corporations recorded a moderate

increase. Total foreign assets of the country were

equivalent to 3.6 months of imports by end 2021

compared to 6.4 months of imports in 2020.

5.7 External Debt and Debt Servicing

5.7.1 External Debt

Sri Lanka’s total external debt position

increased in 2021, mainly with the increase in

the external debt of the Central Bank and deposit

taking corporations. The total external debt of

the country increased to US dollars 50.7 billion at

end 2021 from US dollars 49.0 billion by end 2020.

Although the total outstanding foreign loans of the

Government recorded an increase during the year,

mainly with the receipt of two foreign currency

term financing facilities obtained from the CDB,

the external debt stock of the Government, valued

at the market price, declined from US dollars 28.2

billion at end 2020 to US dollars 27.3 billion at end

2021. This was a result of the combined effect of the

decline in market prices of Sri Lanka’s outstanding

ISBs and the repayment of an ISB that matured in

July 2021. A key reason for the reduction of the

outstanding government external debt in 2021 was

due to lack of new borrowings from international

markets, while repayment of some external debt

obligations of the Government had to be met by

utilising Central Bank's reserves. Meanwhile, the

outstanding external debt of the Central Bank

increased significantly by end 2021 in comparison

to that of end 2020 due to the new bilateral currency

swap arrangements with the Bangladesh Bank and

the PBOC, although the international swap facility

with the RBI obtained in 2020 was repaid during the

year. The outstanding external debt of deposit taking

corporations also increased owing to the significant

increase in currency and deposits although the short

term loans position declined markedly. Meanwhile,

the outstanding external debt of the private sector

corporations and SOBEs declined in 2021 with the

reduction in outstanding trade credit received by

the private sector and with the repayment of foreign

loans of SOBEs, despite the increase in foreign

loans obtained by the private sector corporations.

Further, intercompany borrowing of DIEs recorded

an increase during 2021, as a number of DIEs

received intercompany loans and shareholder

advances during the year.

The total outstanding external debt of the

country as a percentage of GDP recorded a

marginal decline during the year. The total

outstanding external debt as a percentage of GDP

stood at 60.0 per cent at end 2021, compared to

60.5 per cent reported at end 2020, reflecting the

increase in nominal GDP during 2021 compared to

2020. The outstanding external debt position of the

Government out of the total external debt position,

declined to 53.9 per cent by end 2021 from 57.5

per cent recorded at end 2020. In terms of the debt

maturity profile, debt with long term maturity declined

marginally to 50.0 per cent of GDP by end 2021

compared to 50.4 per cent of GDP by end 2020.

5.7.2 Foreign Debt Service Payments

Despite the marginal increase in capital

repayments, Sri Lanka’s external debt service

payments declined in 2021, compared to the

previous year due to the reduction in interest

payments. Capital repayments on external

debt increased to US dollars 3.1 billion in 2021,

compared to US dollars 3.0 billion recorded in

2020. Capital repayments in 2021 included the

bilateral currency swap facility obtained from the

RBI. Further, out of the US dollars 1 billion worth

of ISBs that matured during 2021, US dollars 700

million were paid to non-residents upon maturity,

while the remaining settlement was received

by the residents. Capital repayments of foreign

loans of the Government increased marginally

during the year. Meanwhile, capital repayments of

foreign loans by the private sector, SOBEs and

deposit taking corporations declined considerably

during the year, compared to the previous year.

During the year, the Central Bank continued to

repay the loan instalments related to the Extended

Fund Facility obtained in 2016 from the IMF as

a means of BOP support. Interest payments on

external debt declined during the year to US

dollars 1.4 billion, compared to US dollars 1.6

billion in 2020. This was mainly due to a decline in

coupon payments of ISBs issued to non-residents,

interest payments on foreign investments in

the rupee denominated government securities

market and interest payments on foreign loans

of the Government during the year. Due to the

combined effect of the increase in earnings

from merchandise exports and services and the

decline in external debt service payments in 2021

compared to the previous year, total external debt

service payments as a percentage of export of

goods and services decreased to 30.0 per cent

in 2021 from 35.2 per cent in 2020. The share of

the Government’s external debt service payments

also declined to 81.1 per cent of the total external

debt servicing in 2021 from 86.5 per cent in 2020.

5.8 Exchange Rate Movements

The Sri Lanka rupee was maintained broadly

at stable levels during 2021 and in early 2022,

before being allowed an adjustment in the

exchange rate in early March 2022. The rupee

exhibited some volatility exerting pressure to

depreciate, particularly during the first four months

of 2021 due to limited foreign currency liquidity in

the domestic foreign exchange market. This was

largely due to dried up foreign exchange inflows in

the form of both debt and non debt flows amidst

continued outflows to meet import bills and the

debt servicing requirements of the Government.

The Central Bank's intervention in the domestic

foreign exchange market and the continued use

of moral suasion helped stabilise the external

value of the Sri Lanka rupee during the remainder

of the year, and the first few months of 2022.

Accordingly, with the engagement of the Central

Bank, supported by the LCBs, the weighted

average spot exchange rate in the interbank

market remained broadly stable during the latter

part of 2021 at around Rs. 200 - 203 per US dollar.

As such, the annual depreciation of the rupee

was limited to 7.0 per cent against the US dollar

at end 2021, which helped mitigate the adverse

consequences of excessive depreciation of the

currency at the time the economy was on the

verge of recovering from the devastating shock

from the pandemic. The pressures observed in

the domestic foreign exchange market could also

be partly attributable to the inadequate conversion

of foreign exchange earnings by foreign exchange

earners. With the imposition of regulations on

mandatory conversion requirements of export

proceeds, the foreign exchange liquidity condition

in the domestic market improved to a certain

extent. Meanwhile, reflecting cross currency

exchange rate movements, the Sri Lanka rupee

appreciated against the Japanese yen (3.8 per

cent) and the euro (1.1 per cent), and depreciated

against the pound sterling (6.0 per cent) and

the Indian rupee (5.5 per cent) during 2021.

Furthermore, in the first two months of 2022, the

Sri Lanka rupee remained broadly stable due to

continued moral suasion. However, the pressures

witnessed on the exchange rate amidst dried up

liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market

were amplified in 2021 and early 2022, warranting

a measured adjustment that was allowed in the

exchange rate in early March 2022. However, the

outcome of the exchange rate flexibility that was

thereafter allowed also in early March 2022, fell

short of expectation due to large overshooting by

market forces. Accordingly, the Sri Lanka rupee

depreciated by 33.0 per cent against the US

dollar by end March 2022. Such developments,

along with the removal of other related regulatory

restrictions and newly imposed import restrictions

were expected to encourage more inflows

of foreign exchange to the domestic foreign

exchange market, particularly due to the net gain

for exporters and remitters while discouraging non

urgent imports and other outflows. Reflecting cross

currency exchange rate movements, the Sri Lanka

rupee depreciated against the euro (32.1 per cent),

the Indian rupee (31.7 per cent), the pound sterling

(31.1 per cent), and the Japanese yen (28.9 per

cent) by end March 2022.

Other major currencies depreciated against

the US dollar in 2021 in line with the broad-based

strengthening of the US dollar due to multiple

(a) Changes computed on the basis of foreign currency equivalent of Sri Lanka rupees. The sign (-) indicates depreciation of Sri Lanka rupee against each currency. (b) The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) is a weighted average of nominal exchange rates of 24 trading partner and competitor countries. Weights are based on the trade shares reflecting the relative importance of each currency in each of the currency baskets. The Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) is computed by adjusting the NEER for inflation differentials with respect to each currency in the basket. A minus sign indicates depreciation. CCPI was used for REER computation.(c) The exchange rate has been defined in terms of indices so that the appreciation/depreciation of the rupee relative to other currencies is directly reflected by a rise/fall in the values of the effective exchange rate indices, respectively.

factors including elevated upside volatility

in energy prices, equity underperformance,

policy rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve

and liquidity concerns continuing to push

investors seeking US dollar as a safe haven

currency. Accordingly, by end 2021, the Japanese

yen (10.4 per cent), the euro (8.0 per cent), the

Indian rupee (1.6 per cent), and the pound sterling

(1.1 per cent) depreciated against the US dollar.

With the combined effect of the depreciation of

the rupee against most major currencies, the Sri

Lanka rupee depreciated against the SDR by 4.3

per cent and 32.1 per cent during 2021 and during

2022 until end March, respectively.

5.8.1 Nominal and Real Effective Exchange Rates

The 5-currency and the 24-currency Nominal

Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) indices,

which measure the movements of the Sri

Lanka rupee against the basket of currencies,

declined during the year. NEER indices declined,

reflecting the nominal depreciation of the Sri

Lanka rupee against selected major currencies

together with the movements in cross currency

exchange rates. Accordingly, the 5-currency and

24-currency NEER indices declined by 3.6 per

cent and 4.2 per cent, respectively in 2021. The

Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indices,

which consider the variation in nominal exchange

rates in the baskets of currencies, as well as the

inflation differentials among countries, showed

mixed performances. Accordingly, the 5-currency

REER index increased by 6.9 per cent, while

the 24-currency REER index declined by 2.6

per cent in 2021. However, the REER indices

remained predominantly below the base year

level (2017=100) in 2021, indicating the continued

competitiveness of the Sri Lanka rupee. With the

sharp depreciation of the exchange rate in March

2022, both NEER and REER indices declined

substantially, reflecting the nominal depreciation

of the Sri Lanka rupee against the US dollar and

other major currencies considered in the basket.

Accordingly, 5-currency NEER and REER indices

declined by 31.9 per cent and 31.1 per cent,

respectively, and 24-currency NEER and REER

indices declined by 32.1 per cent and 35.1 per

cent, respectively, by end March 2022.

5.8.2 Developments in the Domestic Foreign Exchange Market

The transaction volumes in the domestic

foreign exchange market further declined in

2021. Accordingly, the volume of interbank foreign

exchange transactions declined to US dollars 12,160

million in 2021, in comparison to US dollars 18,408

million in 2020. The total volume of spot exchange

transactions declined significantly to US dollars

5,852 million (48.1 per cent of total transactions)

in 2021, in comparison to US dollars 10,445 million

in 2020. The total volume of forward transactions

also decreased to US dollars 6,308 million in 2021

from US dollars 7,964 million in 2020. Meanwhile,

the Central Bank intervened in the domestic foreign

exchange market by way of supplying US dollars

747 million on a net basis in 2021. The net figure

was the result of the supply of US dollars 1,253

million and the purchase of US dollars 506 million

during the year. Moreover, the Central Bank

continued to intervene in the domestic foreign

exchange market during the first quarter of 2022

by supplying US dollars 265 million, on a net basis.

The intervention of the Central Bank helped avoid

large volatility in the exchange rate and supported

the need for financing essential imports to ensure

the avoidance of disruptions to the economy and

people. However, the fixed exchange rate that

prevailed during the latter part of 2021, is likely

to have helped importers to frontload imports at

cheaper costs, while exporters were reluctant

to convert their export proceeds, impacting the

domestic foreign exchange market negatively.
