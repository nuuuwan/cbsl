laundering  of  money  and  financing  of  terrorism.  For 
instance,  Hawala  channels  were  used  to  finance  the 
activities  that  led  to  the  deadly  terrorist  attack  on  the 
US  World  Trade  Centre  in  2001.  Some  favourable 
characteristics  such  as  low  cost  of  transactions,  easy 
access, less paperwork, and quick transfers make these 
channels  popular  among 
an  informal  business  with  the  involvement  of  possible 
criminal activities, the possibility of losing money makes 
them a risky channel. Most importantly, these channels 
are  highly  vulnerable  to  misuse  by  money  launderers 
and  terrorist  financiers.  These  types  of  informal  and 
illegitimate  payment  channels  could  be  detrimental 
to 
the  smooth 
functioning  of 
economic activity of a country, as they move economic 
resources from the formal sector to the informal sector 
of an economy. This article intends to shed light on the 
adverse impacts of informal money remittance channels 
on  financial  systems  and  the  economy  of  a  country. 
Since all these informal remittance channels have more 
or less the same characteristics, the article will focus on 
the mainly used channel in Sri Lanka, namely Hawala,","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
