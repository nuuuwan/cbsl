the development of MSMEs, as it does not only prevent 
financial institutions’ ability to evaluate these businesses, 
but  also

MSMEs  across 
the  world  endured  difficulties  during 
such  as  imposing  lending  targets  to  drive  lending  by 
the  COVID-19  pandemic,  which  created  large  losses 
in  revenue  and 
financing via multinational agencies, improving access 
unprecedented levels of policy support by governments 
and other authorities may have helped these businesses 
to weather this difficult period, many of them have not 
recovered  fully.  The  uncertainty  in  the  global  political 
landscape due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict may also 
create difficulties for MSMEs, particularly for those who 
are linked with value chains, exports and services trades 
such as tourism.
Gender-wise disparities: The participation of women 
entrepreneurs 
in  MSMEs 
is 
found 
countries.  Studies 
report  about  one 
small  businesses  are  owned  by  women,  although  this 
share  ranges  from  a  high  of  more  than  40  per  cent 
in  East  Asia  and  the  Pacific  to  a  low  of  below  10  per 
cent in South Asia (IFC, 2014). In addition to common 
challenges  faced  by  small  businesses,  women  owned 
MSMEs 
face  additional  hindrances,  depending  on 
cultural  biases,  and  relatively  low  levels  of  size  and 
networks.  The  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  is 
also  found  to  be  disproportionate  on  women-owned 
MSMEs,  where  a  larger  proportion  of  women-owned 
businesses than men-owned businesses are found to be 
affected by the pandemic and are likely not to survive 
(United Nations, 2021). However, there exists evidence 
to  suggest  that  women-owned  MSMEs  are  performing 
well, although often overlooked by financial institutions 
(IFC,  2014).  Women 
entrepreneurs  are  better  at 
achieving development goals, as women are found to 
reinvest more in families and communities (International 
Trade Centre, 2014), thus highlighting the importance 
of continuous commitment to address these gender-wise 
disparities to achieve inclusive growth.
Successful  Strategies 
to  Promote

A  variety  of  strategies  have  been  used  by  different 
countries 
to  address 
common  problems 
MSMEs.
Addressing  financing  difficulties:  As  many  MSMEs 
find it difficult to access finance from formal channels, 
strategies to minimise this limitation can often contribute 
to 
the  growth  of  MSMEs.  Moreover,  many  other 
challenges faced by small businesses are also linked to 
low capacity, often as a result of funding difficulties. In 
this regard, some of the successful strategies undertaken 
by

countries
