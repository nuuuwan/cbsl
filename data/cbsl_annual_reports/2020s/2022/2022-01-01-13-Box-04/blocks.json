MSMEs appear to heavily contribute to increasing the income levels of low income families, and thereby contribute to reducing disparities in the income distribution. Further, as a result of their small size and customer centric business models, small businesses are also more flexible and better able to withstand changes in the economic landscape by adapting to the changing environment and new advancements in technology.

As per the estimates of the World Bank, about 600 million jobs will be needed by 2030 in order to accommodate the growing population. Given typically high levels of population growth in developing countries, the role of MSMEs as an employment provider becomes extremely vital. In this regard, MSMEs are more important than large organisations, as MSMEs are generally more labour intensive and have the potential to absorb large labour forces in developing and emerging countries. Further, developing countries can utilise MSMEs to address issues such as improving female labour force participation, effective use of underutilised natural resources, and diversifying economic activities across various sectors. At the same time, the innovative capacity of MSMEs, given enabling conditions, could assist developing and emerging economies to avoid growth stagnation, enabling them to elevate into higher income countries. It is noted that the growth prospects of Asian economies, such as Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, India etc., are driven by small businesses which are innovative, highlighting the importance of policy support to facilitate innovative activities in MSMEs (Asian Productivity Organization, 2015).",

Inability to retain key employees is also perceived as a concern hindering the progress of MSMEs. In many instances, job opportunities provided by MSMEs tend to be temporary, driving employees to constantly search for other opportunities. At the same time, MSMEs often cannot compete on pay and benefits offered by large organisations, especially for skilled workers, thus resulting in higher worker turnover and the inability to retain such skilled workers, who are capable of driving the development of small businesses.

For example, even though regulatory barriers have seen a large reduction in OECD countries over the last decade or so, the complexity of such barriers remains diverse across countries (OECD, 2018). Small businesses typically do not have the capacity to effectively study regulatory complexities due to the low availability of skills and funding. As a result, overall limitations in the doing-business environment could lead to multiple difficulties for MSMEs, which may especially be the case with developing countries, as they operate with relatively weak institutional infrastructure.

In addition to common challenges faced by small businesses, women owned MSMEs face additional hindrances, depending on cultural biases, and relatively low levels of size and networks. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is also found to be disproportionate on women-owned MSMEs, where a larger proportion of women-owned businesses than men-owned businesses are found to be affected by the pandemic and are likely not to survive (United Nations, 2021). However, there exists evidence to suggest that women-owned MSMEs are performing well, although often overlooked by financial institutions (IFC, 2014). Women entrepreneurs are better at achieving development goals, as women are found to reinvest more in families and communities (International Trade Centre, 2014), thus highlighting the importance of continuous commitment to address these gender-wise disparities to achieve inclusive growth.",

Nevertheless, many of the common hurdles to their development discussed above are faced by Sri Lankan MSMEs as well. Despite their importance to the economic output of the country, which is reported in excess of 50 per cent,4 most Sri Lankan MSMEs may not have reached their true potential due to capacity limitations (often linked with limited access to finance), low adoption of technology and limited linkages to value chains, both domestic and global. Driven by low financial literacy and difficulties in accessing the formal financial system due to a variety of reasons, many small businesses in Sri Lanka end up utilising the services of unregistered money lenders, who are widely spread across the country, providing financial services at extremely high interest rates. Subsequently, many such entrepreneurs face difficulties in meeting high interest costs, thereby threatening the viability of their business ventures. The informal nature of such lending services makes it hard to track such activities, thereby limiting the ability to take effective regulatory actions as well. Meanwhile, like in other countries, lack of information has also been a serious limitation to making a meaningful assessment of MSMEs in Sri Lanka, while also making it difficult to",

For example, the National Policy Framework for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) Development of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (2016) comprise detailed action plans for the development of the MSME sector. However, the implementation and coordination of such policies remain weak, requiring further improvements in the implementation process. The Central Bank also plays an important facilitating role in supporting small businesses under its agency function of regional development. Accordingly, both financial and non-financial support is provided, together with participatory financial institutions and a number of other resource providers. Meanwhile, the large policy support extended to MSMEs during the pandemic could have helped the sector to stay afloat during this difficult period. However, in general, MSMEs in Sri Lanka are yet to exploit new normal opportunities created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, the prevailing uncertainty of the global and domestic economic activity can be harmful to MSMEs, which require remedial and preventive policies. Going forward, timely measures are required for the implementation of \u2018enablers\u2019, including the expeditious operationalisation of the proposed credit guarantee institution and the establishment of a dedicated development bank, in order to extend the required sustained support for MSMEs to prevail and prosper through challenging times.
