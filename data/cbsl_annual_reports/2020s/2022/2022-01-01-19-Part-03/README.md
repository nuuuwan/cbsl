Circular No. 10 of 2021 13 September 2021

EXTENSION OF DEBT MORATORIUM FOR COVID-19 AFFECTED BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS IN THE TOURISM INDUSTRY

With a view to meeting the challenges faced by businesses and individuals engaged in tourism sector due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) requests licensed commercial banks and licensed specialised banks, (hereinafter referred to as licensed banks), to extend the debt moratorium granted for tourism sector under Circular No. 08 of 2020 dated 26 August 2020 (hereinafter referred to as the Scheme) for another nine months commencing 1 October 2021 as specified below. However, licensed banks may offer any additional options to borrowers, on the request of the borrower, in a way that the overall benefits to borrowers are not less than the benefits offered under this Circular. Accordingly, this Circular is issued to give effect to the Scheme in a consistent manner across all licensed banks.

A. The following provisions of the Circular No. 08 of 2020 have been amended and other provisions of the Circular No. 08 of 2020 will remain unchanged:

1. General Terms and Conditions

1 (i) (b) Employees of eligible businesses and members of eligible associations who are affected by COVID-19. In the case of such employees and members, the registration of the business or the association with the relevant institutions referred in (a) above shall be considered sufficient.

1 (iii) Debt moratorium refers to moratorium for both capital and interest for a further period of nine months commencing 1 October 2021 to 30 June 2022.

1 (iv) Eligible borrowers who wish to avail the moratorium shall make a request seeking such moratorium to the relevant licensed bank on or before 15 October 2021. Licensed banks are requested to accept any request submitted after 15 October 2021, if the reasons for delay in making such requests are acceptable. Any eligible borrower who has the capacity to service the loan repayment is expected to service such loan repayments instead of requesting for this extension.

2. Structuring the debt moratorium

2 (i) Licensed banks shall convert the capital and interest falling due during the moratorium period commencing from 1 October 2021 to 30 June 2022 into a term loan. Licensed banks shall amalgamate the capital and interest falling due during the previous moratorium granted with the capital and interest falling due during 1 October 2021 to 30 June 2022

2 (ii) Licensed banks may commence recovery of such converted loan once the extended moratorium period is over.

2(v) Licensed banks shall waive off the accrued and unpaid penal interest as at 1 October 2021, if any, on performing loans considered under this Circular. Penal interest shall not be accrued and charged during the moratorium period.

3. Reporting Requirement

Licensed banks shall continue to report the details of moratorium availed by borrowers to the Director of Bank Supervision as at 30th of each month, within 15 working days as per the reporting format prescribed under Circular No. 08 of 2020.

B. The following new provisions are included in this Circular:

1. Alternatively, licensed banks may restructure the existing credit facilities over a longer period, considering the repayment capacity of the borrower and an acceptable revival plan. In this case, the licensed bank and the borrower shall agree on terms and conditions including a concessionary interest rate, considering the prevailing low interest rates.

2. In the case where an eligible borrower has expressed his/her willingness to settle the existing credit facilities or amounts fallen due during the moratorium period, instead of opting for moratorium under this Circular, licensed banks are encouraged to provide interest rebates. Further, licensed banks shall waive-off early settlement fees and other fees and charges including recovery of future interest of lease facilities, if any.

3. Licensed banks shall suspend all types of recovery actions against non-performing facilities until 30 June 2022, provided that such facilities have been classified as non-performing on or after 01 April 2020. Further, licensed banks shall take all the precautions not to excessively contact/force the borrower or visit the borrower as part of the routine collection procedure with regard to the above borrowers. In instances where there are on-going litigations in Courts relating to recovery, borrowers shall enter into an agreement in the Courts to obtain this concession.

Licensed banks shall account for the concession granted under this scheme as per guidelines issued by CBSL to licensed banks on adoption of Sri Lanka Accounting Standards – SLFRS 9: Financial Instruments. Licensed banks shall identify tourism sector as a risk elevated sector and provide accordingly. Licensed banks may seek advice from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CASL) and Auditors for additional guidance/clarification in this regard.

5. Licensed banks are required to seek necessary guidelines from the relevant agencies with regard to providing concessions for credit facilities granted under various refinance or interest subsidy schemes.

Upon crediting such export proceeds to the respective foreign currency accounts, Licensed Banks are also required to take measures to stop the withdrawal and / or conversion of such export proceeds from the respective foreign currency accounts until the necessary documents and / or information are furnished by the exporter(s) to the bank.

At the end of the cultivation period branch manager should classify the defaulted farmer into two categories; i.e., a Willful Defaulter and a Non-willful Defaulter. The classification should be made on the basis of information available to the branch manager through the field officers.

8.1 Willful Defaulter

in terms of available information, the officer of the branch/field officer observe that the borrower had a good harvest but has failed settling his obligations to the PFI, such borrowers should be classified as a willful defaulter.

8.2 Non-willful Defaulter

If a borrower has experienced difficulty in meeting his obligations to the PFI due to crop damaged by natural calamity such as floods, drought or pests or other specific reason that is beyond the control of a borrower and accepted by CBSL, such borrowers should be classified as a non-willful defaulter.

9. Recoveries

9.1.1 Immediate action should be taken to recover the dues from defaulters through legal actions. A set of legal actions that can be taken is given in Section 10.

9.3 It is expected that PFIs take prompt and effective actions for the recovery of any overdue amount in all possible ways.

(i) Visit the borrower (minimum of 2 visits) to ascertain the reasons for the non-payments and persuade him to repay the dues.

(ii) Ascertain and examine the difficulties faced by the borrower and recommend to the borrower a course of actions to be followed by him to overcome such difficulties.

(iv) In the case of a willful borrower, issue a notice of demand on the borrower and the guarantors.

(v) Where it is found that the loan proceeds have been misused, the notice of demand should be issued forthwith and steps should be taken immediately to institute legal action against such borrowers.

10. Legal Action

10.2 When defaulters do not come into a settlement, PFI should file cases against such defaulters in an appropriate Court within 9 - 12 months from the due date of first installment in arrears.

11. Credit Guarantee Settlement

In terms of Section 108A of the Monetary Law Act (Chapter 422), the CBSL will provide guarantees to PFIs under the Scheme in respect of loans granted for the purposes given in Annexure I. CBSL provides credit guarantee as a facilitation for the liquidity shortages that arise due to the non-payment of expected loan repayment installments and hence the PFIs should remit such credit guarantee settlement received to the CBSL, once they recovered dues from defaulters.

11.5 Premium

11.5.1 The Premium is payable to the CBSL at the rate of half (½) per cent on each cultivation loan released by the PFI under the Scheme. There is no separate application for the guarantee, and therefore the premium should be paid with application for interest subsidy, and it should be calculated on the total loan amount eligible under the scheme, as per the scales of finance given at Annexure II.

11.5.2 PFIs are required to pay premium for the relevant season through the respective Head Office. Remittance of the premium shall be by way of a cheque, drawn in favour of “Director, Regional Development Department,

11.6.2 A loan under the scheme is deemed to be in loss after completion of the following steps;

(a) Where the PFI has exhausted all the means available to recover the loan such as visiting the borrower to persuade borrower to repay the loan, invoking the assistance of guarantors where such guarantees have been taken and upon the issue of a demand notice to the borrower, the loan will be deemed to be in loss. A minimum of two visits to the borrower must be undertaken before submitting a claim to the CBSL. The records of such visits must be made available to officers of the CBSL during inspection of PFIs on the Scheme. The PFI should serve the notice of demand on the borrower and guarantors, where applicable.
