However, NBFIs may offer any additional options to borrowers, on the request of the borrower, in a way that the overall benefits to borrowers are not less than the benefits offered under this Circular. The aforementioned extension is granted in order to provide adequate time for borrowers to come up with proposals for a long-term arrangement. Therefore, borrowers shall submit an acceptable plan to NBFIs for restructuring of credit facilities over a long period of time, prior to the expiry of the extended moratorium period. Such plans shall be assessed on case-by-case basis by NBFIs. Accordingly, this Circular is issued to give effect to the Scheme in a consistent manner across all NBFIs.",
