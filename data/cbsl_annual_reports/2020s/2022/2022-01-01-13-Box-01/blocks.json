    "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an organisation established in 1944 to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world. The IMF usually provides loans under its programmes to member countries that experience Balance of Payments (BOP) problems to support rebuilding international reserves, stabilising currencies, ensuring continuity in payments for imports, and restoring economic growth, while correcting underlying problems. All IMF members are eligible to access IMF\u2019s resources in the General Resources Account (GRA) on non concessional terms, and the IMF also provides concessional financial support through the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), which is tailored to the diversity and needs of low-income countries. For emerging and advanced market economies in crises, IMF assistance is provided through Stand-By Arrangements (SBAs) to address short term or potential BOP problems. The Stand-By Credit Facility (SCF) serves a similar purpose for low-income countries. The Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the corresponding Extended Credit Facility (ECF) for low-income countries are the main facilities aimed at providing medium term support to countries facing protracted BOP problems. To help prevent or mitigate crises and boost market confidence, members with already strong policies can use the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) or the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL). The Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) and the corresponding Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) for low-income countries provide rapid assistance to countries with urgent BOP needs, including difficulties posed by commodity price shocks, natural disasters, and domestic fragilities. Objectives, policies and conditionality under an IMF funding arrangement depend on a country\u2019s specific economic circumstances.",

Conditionalities in IMF programmes in general cover key macroeconomic and structural policy adjustments. Even though these conditionalities were largely focused on macroeconomic policies until the early 1980s, the complexity and scope of structural conditions increased subsequently, reflecting the IMF\u2019s growing involvement in low-income and transitional countries. These conditionalities are intended to help countries resolve BOP problems, while avoiding recurring instances of such problems. Further, the remedial measures are intended to ensure that the country\u2019s BOP will be strong enough to meet payments for imports and to service external debt in a sustained manner.",

For the RCF and the RFI facilities provided by the IMF, there is no ex-post programme based conditionality or reviews except for limited overall conditionality. If a country fails to meet QPC, the IMF Executive Board may approve a waiver if it is satisfied that the programme will still succeed, provided that the deviation is minor/temporary or national authorities are taking corrective actions.

The previous IMF programmes concentrated primarily on improving foreign reserves and the conduct of monetary policy. In addition, there was emphasis on undertaking vital structural reforms that included the introduction of a fuel price formula, improving the Central Bank\u2019s independence, a flexible exchange rate policy, and revenue based fiscal consolidation. In the Sri Lankan context, for official dealings with the IMF, the Hon. Minister of Finance holds the capacity of the Governor of the IMF, and the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) holds the capacity of the Alternate Governor of the IMF.",

Most reforms identified in the previous IMF programmes have not been completed fully or abandoned abruptly after drawing some disbursements under the financing facilities, while meeting only short term objectives. This has led to a cycle of being in and out of IMF programmes frequently as shown in Table B 1.1. In contrast, India, which obtained seven programmes from the IMF during 1951 to 1993, has not approached the IMF since the conclusion of its last programme in 1993. If an IMF programme is completed successfully, the economy would be able to reap the long term benefits, especially through structural adjustments, and the need to approach the IMF on future occasions of short term economic stresses would have been minimal.

    "text": "As previously mentioned, Sri Lanka has entered into IMF programmes from time to time to support the BOP position and the Government\u2019s reforms agenda. However, unlike in previous occasions, in the current context, an IMF programme will be an important part of strategies to overcome prevailing challenging economic conditions in the country. Considering the current low level of international reserves, servicing the significantly high debt repayments due in the near term will be extremely challenging. Liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market has dried up amidst high foreign debt service payments and the reduction in foreign exchange inflows, resulting in significant depletion of gross official reserves and inadequate foreign exchange to meet the forex demands for essential imports, such as fuel, gas, coal, medicine, and essential food items. In this context, there is a need for securing a sizeable amount of foreign financing in the immediate future. Entering into an IMF programme would not only provide access to additional financing but would also enhance the confidence of potential foreign investors, including multilateral and bilateral counterparts. This, coupled with the implementation of a macroeconomic policy package, is expected to stabilise the overall macroeconomy which will further promote non debt creating financial inflows.",

Some of the aforementioned measures have been already implemented by the CBSL and the Government. The monetary policy has been significantly tightened,",

    "text": "the exchange rate is increasingly being determined by market forces, and adjustments to prices of domestic petroleum and LP gas have been allowed to reflect costs. These macroeconomic stabilisation measures could result in a painful adjustment to the economy in the adjustment stage, but it has become imperative considering the current economic crisis. However, in order to successfully implement an IMF programme, the country should ensure the management of external debt sustainably through appropriate measures. Towards this end, the Government has already announced the suspension of external debt servicing for an interim period pending an orderly and consensual restructuring of debt obligations in a manner consistent with an economic adjustment programme supported by the IMF. Further, political and social stability needs to be achieved through an agreement between all relevant stakeholders to successfully negotiate and implement an IMF programme. The success of this will also rest on the extent to which the long neglected structural reforms are implemented in a way that ensures sustainable macroeconomic stability.",
