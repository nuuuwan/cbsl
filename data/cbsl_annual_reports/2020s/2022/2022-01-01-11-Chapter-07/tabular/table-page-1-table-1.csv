The  Central  Bank  reversed  its  accommodative  monetary  policy  stance  in  2021  to  contain  the  build-"
"the private sector to support the economy in its phase of recovery. Accordingly, credit to both the public and"
"private sectors expanded considerably underpinned by the abundance of low cost funds, thereby causing the"
"expansion of broad money supply. With the aim of preempting any build-up of excessive inflationary pressures"
"over the medium term and addressing imbalances in the external sector and financial markets, the Central Bank"
"decided to increase policy interest rates and the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) applicable on all rupee deposit"
"liabilities of Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) in August 2021. Along with monetary tightening, foreign loan"
"repayments of the Government using gross official reserves, and increased currency in circulation caused a"
"reduction in liquidity in the domestic money market. Triggered by such tight policy measures, short term market"
"interest rates adjusted upwards followed by a gradual increase in other market interest rates, including yields"
"on government securities that were also allowed to increase supported by the removal of maximum yield rates"
"for acceptance on government securities auctions in the primary market. With challenges emanating from the"
"external sector and inflation fronts, particularly considering the breach of the achievement of 12 consecutive"
"years of single digit inflation, measures were taken to further tighten the monetary policy stance during the first"
"quarter of 2022 to contain underlying demand pressures in the economy and anchor inflation expectations."
"The  restrictive  policy  measures  included  the  raising  of  policy  interest  rates,  easing  of  caps  on  domestic"
"lending rates, removal of caps on foreign currency deposit rates and raising of rates relevant to concessional"
"mortgage-backed housing loans. Following the sharp depreciation of the rupee and the sustained rise in global"
"commodity  prices,  sharp  upward  adjustments  to  domestic  prices  were  observed  posing  substantial  upside"
"risks to inflation. In response, the Central Bank significantly tightened its stance on monetary policy in April"
"2022 by raising its policy interest rates by 700 basis points, the highest single-day adjustment in recent history,"
"while removing almost all caps imposed on lending products. Such policy response, along with the expected"
"suppression of import demand following the rupee depreciation and the anticipated improvements in supply"
"conditions of key commodities globally, is expected to arrest the build-up of underlying demand pressures in the"
"economy, thereby restoring price and economic stability over the medium term."
