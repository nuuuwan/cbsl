7.1 OverviewT

he Central Bank reversed its accommodative monetary policy stance in 2021 to contain the build-up of inflationary pressures and address the imbalances on the external front. The monetary policy support extended by the Central Bank during the pandemic, continued into most of 2021 causing market interest rates to decline to historically low levels, while facilitating the funding needs of the Government and the private sector to support the economy in its phase of recovery. Accordingly, credit to both the public and private sectors expanded considerably underpinned by the abundance of low cost funds, thereby causing the expansion of broad money supply. With the aim of preempting any build-up of excessive inflationary pressures over the medium term and addressing imbalances in the external sector and financial markets, the Central Bank decided to increase policy interest rates and the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) applicable on all rupee deposit liabilities of Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) in August 2021. Along with monetary tightening, foreign loan repayments of the Government using gross official reserves, and increased currency in circulation caused a reduction in liquidity in the domestic money market. Triggered by such tight policy measures, short term market interest rates adjusted upwards followed by a gradual increase in other market interest rates, including yields on government securities that were also allowed to increase supported by the removal of maximum yield rates for acceptance on government securities auctions in the primary market. With challenges emanating from the external sector and inflation fronts, particularly considering the breach of the achievement of 12 consecutive years of single digit inflation, measures were taken to further tighten the monetary policy stance during the first quarter of 2022 to contain underlying demand pressures in the economy and anchor inflation expectations. The restrictive policy measures included the raising of policy interest rates, easing of caps on domestic lending rates, removal of caps on foreign currency deposit rates and raising of rates relevant to concessional mortgage-backed housing loans. Following the sharp depreciation of the rupee and the sustained rise in global commodity prices, sharp upward adjustments to domestic prices were observed posing substantial upside risks to inflation. In response, the Central Bank significantly tightened its stance on monetary policy in April 2022 by raising its policy interest rates by 700 basis points, the highest single-day adjustment in recent history, while removing almost all caps imposed on lending products. Such policy response, along with the expected suppression of import demand following the rupee depreciation and the anticipated improvements in supply conditions of key commodities globally, is expected to arrest the build-up of underlying demand pressures in the economy, thereby restoring price and economic stability over the medium term.

7.2 Monetary Policy Stance

The Central Bank, which continued to

provide unprecedented monetary stimulus

since the onset of the pandemic to support

economic activity and the government

cashflow, commenced tightening its monetary

policy stance since August 2021 with the

aim of preempting the build-up of excessive

inflationary pressures beyond desired levels

in the economy and addressing imbalances

in the external sector and financial markets.

The continuation of the extraordinary monetary

policy accommodation during the first half of

2021 was required to contain the impact of the

multiple waves of the COVID-19 pandemic since

early 2020, which severely disrupted economic

activity. The ultra accommodative monetary policy

stance of the Central Bank and the large infusion

of liquidity to the domestic money market brought

most market interest rates to their historic lows

during 2021, thereby reducing the cost of funds

for both private and public sectors. Accordingly,

credit to the private sector remained robust

supporting the recovery of economic activity.

Credit to the public sector, particularly net credit

to the Government from the banking system,

including the monetary financing from the Central

Bank, expanded substantially during the year. The

Central Bank provided financial support to the

Government by way of purchasing a significant

amount of Treasury bills from the primary market,

as well as direct allocations of Treasury bills to

the Central Bank to meet the emergency funding

needs of the Government amidst disruptions to

its cashflows due to lower than expected revenue

mobilisation and high expenditure. The resultant

expansion in domestic credit caused broad

money aggregates to remain elevated, although

its expansion was moderated by the notable

decline in net foreign assets (NFA) of the banking

system during 2021. As some signs of imbalances

in the economy were witnessed, particularly the

build-up of demand pressures and pressures

in the external sector and financial markets,

the Central Bank was compelled to commence

tightening monetary and liquidity conditions during

the second half of 2021 with a view to stabilising

the overall macroeconomy. Accordingly, the

policy interest rates of the Central Bank, i.e.,

the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and

the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) were

raised by 50 basis points each in mid-August 2021

to 5.00 per cent and 6.00 per cent, respectively.

The Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) was also

increased by 2 percentage points to 4.0 per cent

effective September 2021 causing an absorption of

Rs. 170 billion from the banking system, alongside

several other measures. In addition, due to tight

liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market,

interest rates offered by some banks for foreign

currency deposits increased notably, requiring the

Central Bank to impose a ceiling on interest rates

offered for foreign currency deposit products of

Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) and National

Savings Bank (NSB) in August 2021 to address

the anomalies between interest rates of rupee and

foreign currency deposits. Following the tightening

of the monetary policy stance, overall liquidity in

the domestic money market turned into large deficit

levels, resulting in a gradual upward adjustment in

the market interest rates structure.

However, with inflation continuing to

accelerate beyond desired levels amidst

sustained pressures in the external sector along

with the accommodative fiscal policy stance, the

monetary policy measures adopted in August

2021 turned more hawkish in 2022. Accordingly,

policy interest rates were increased by 150 basis

points, in aggregate, during the period from January

to March 2022, thereby containing the expansion

of money and credit, which also fuel demand for

imports, while also preventing the possible build-up

of adverse inflationary expectations amidst the

continued rise in prices generated by unfavourable

supply side developments. Reflecting the impact of

tightened monetary policy and the revisions to the

other regulatory measures, market interest rates

commenced adjusting upwards gradually. The

maximum interest rate imposed on foreign currency

deposits of LCBs and NSB was eased in December

2021 allowing to reflect prevailing market conditions

and subsequently removed in March 2022.

Further, the interest rate applicable on the special

mortgage-backed housing loan scheme for salaried

employees introduced in December 2020 was also

revised. In addition, caps imposed in August 2020

on interest rates of domestic lending products

were revised upwards in March 2022. Although

monetary policy was systematically tightened to

contain inflationary pressures in the economy, the

significant depreciation of the rupee, which along

with the sustained rise in global commodity prices,

particularly international crude oil prices, led to

immediate sharp upward adjustments in domestic

prices, thereby posing substantial upside risks to

inflation. Having identified the need to counter the

effects of such inflationary pressures and pre-empt

the escalation of adverse inflationary expectations

among other concerns, the Central Bank decided

MONETARY POLICY, INTEREST RATES, MONEY AND CREDIT

7

209

to further tighten its stance on monetary policy in

April 2022 by significantly raising its policy interest

rates by 700 basis points, the highest single-

day adjustment in recent history, along with the

decision to remove almost all caps imposed on

lending products. Supported by these measures,

market interest rates are expected to increase

notably thus discouraging excessive consumption

and encouraging savings. This would enable the

easing of underlying demand pressures in the

economy as well as expectations, thereby aiding

to retrace inflation back to the desired single digit

levels over the medium term, thus ensuring overall

macroeconomic stability.

The Central Bank conducted its

communication policy in 2021 principally to

publicise accurate information on Central

Bank actions to shape expectations and the

behaviour of economic agents, with a view to

supporting economic stability in the near term

amidst multiple external challenges to the

economy. In this regard, the Central Bank used

conventional communication channels as well as

social media and digital platforms to disseminate

information in an opportune manner. The year

began with the unveiling of the ‘Road Map: Monetary

and Financial Sector Policies for 2021 and Beyond’

in early 2021 that enunciated monetary policy and

financial sector policies for the medium term. With

the intensification of challenges and mounting

uncertainties, the Central Bank presented ‘The

Six-Month Road Map for Ensuring Macroeconomic

and Financial System Stability’ in October 2021 with

a view to strengthening the economy and delivering

macroeconomic stability by providing an assurance

to the market based on a three-pronged framework.

The Central Bank continued to communicate the

monetary policy stance during the year focusing on

guiding the market, which was accompanied with

medium term projections as relevant, to anchor

stakeholder expectations. Amidst intermittent

restrictions on social distancing, the Central Bank

continued to conduct online sessions of monetary

policy press conferences, while also having regular

in-person sessions whenever possible. In addition

to live streaming of such occasions via social media,

the Central Bank took necessary measures to issue

press releases, conduct webinars, seminars and

interviews on a frequent basis in three languages

emphasising its policies for stability and enhancing

awareness of stakeholders. Further, even amidst

the challenges posed by the pandemic situation,

the regular trilingual publications of the Central

Bank, including the Annual Report and the Recent

Economic Developments, were released. The

Central Bank also kept up with the publication of

key macroeconomic statistics on its official website

in daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly frequencies.

7.3 Developments in Inflation

Headline inflation accelerated in 2021 driven

mainly by global and domestic supply side

disturbances, the surge in global commodity

prices, upward revisions to administered

prices, while also reflecting gradually firmed

up demand pressures amidst increased

disposable incomes. Headline inflation,

as measured by the year-on-year change in

the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI,

2013=100) and the National Consumer Price Index

(NCPI, 2013=100), which remained at relatively

low levels at the beginning of the year, accelerated

thereafter driven by the acceleration of food

inflation as well as non-food inflation. The elevated

food inflation was mostly due to supply side

disruptions owing to pandemic related restrictions

and the drop in production of certain food items

(rice, vegetables, etc.). Further, extensive rise

in global prices of oil, gas and certain other

commodities led to several upward revisions in

domestic prices of goods and services. With the

effects of sudden price adjustments spilling over to

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

210

other sectors along with the removal of Maximum

Retail Prices as a method of absorbing external

price shocks, both food inflation and non-food

inflation accelerated notably during the latter part of

2021. Moreover, the rise in non-food inflation was

fuelled by the increase in expenditure of categories

such as health due to pandemic related high-cost

driven factors. Accordingly, following an era of

12 consecutive years of single digit inflation,

year-on-year headline inflation based on the CCPI

accelerated to 12.1 per cent by end 2021 from

4.2 per cent at end 2020. Annual average inflation

also rose to 6.0 per cent in 2021 from 4.6 per cent

recorded in 2020. Following a similar trend,

year-on-year headline inflation based on the NCPI

also accelerated to 14.0 per cent by end 2021

from 4.6 per cent at end 2020. Annual average

inflation based on the NCPI was recorded at

7.0 per cent in 2021 compared to 6.2 per cent

recorded in the previous year. The acceleration

of inflation continued in early 2022 as well with

year-on-year headline inflation based on the CCPI

recording 18.7 per cent in March 2022, while that

of NCPI accelerating to 17.5 per cent in February

2022.

Reflecting the lagged effect of significant

monetary accommodation, core inflation,

which measures the underlying demand driven

component of inflation, also followed an upward

trend in the second half of 2021. The year-on-year

core inflation which remained at moderate levels

at the beginning of 2021 accelerated thereafter.

Although volatile food, energy and transport

categories are excluded when measuring core

inflation, several upward price revisions made to

Introduction

Central banks are concerned about maintaining low and stable inflation, i.e., price stability, which is their prime objective. By design, monetary policy is biased towards acting to arrest excessive inflation and hence protecting the purchasing power of the public, particularly the poor, as inflation disproportionately harms low income and fixed income earners. With concerted policy efforts and continuous improvements to monetary policymaking, including the adoption of an inflation targeting framework, global inflation witnessed a clear downward trend in the last several decades. However, frequent high inflation episodes were witnessed globally as well as domestically due to several reasons. Having a comprehensive analysis of such recent events is vital for appropriate policy responses, which would be beneficial in encountering such episodes in the future and mitigating adverse implications.

High Inflation Episodes in History

Even though global inflation was on a downward trend in the aftermath of World War II, there have been occasional high inflation episodes in some countries due to the elimination of price controls, supply shortages, pent-up demand, and policy mistakes in some circumstances. Literature provides for different trends and characteristics of the movements in global inflation over time, based on different classes of economies (Figure B 8.1).

Aggravated pressures on the US dollar due to large monetary expansion in the late 1960s as led by gold convertibility began to cause inflationary pressures on the economy and this spread to the rest of the world via the

balance of payments deficit of the country. This is referred to as the beginning of “The Great Inflation” and resulted in the collapse of the Bretton Woods Agreement1 by the early 1970s, along with the suspension of dollar convertibility to gold by the authorities of the United States. However, extended by the oil price surge in 1973 with the formation of an embargo by the Organisation of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC), global median consumer price inflation peaked in 1974. Advanced economies responded to the price shock by monetary policy tightening and as a result, inflation tended to decline only in mid-1980s as policy transmission was disturbed by another surge in oil prices in the early 1980s, which was caused by the Iranian Revolution and subsequent Iran-Iraq War. Accordingly, median consumer price inflation in advanced economies, which was at double digit levels in 1974 declined to lower single digits by 1986 and assured the central bank credibility even amidst threats of deep recessions. This was reflected in the quadrupled interest rates in the United States within the five years from 1976 to 1981, which in turn resulted in a sharp contraction of the output between early 1981 and 1982. Some advanced economies in Europe also responded to this peak in inflation in a more stringent manner. The success of this containment of inflation during the period known as “The Great Moderation” is greatly attributed to the stabilisation of the macroeconomy through policy measures. It was characteristic for most of the countries who witnessed high inflation to adopt inflation targeting as their policy framework, resulting in global disinflation with lesser volatility. However, emerging markets and developing economies, and low income countries experienced a delayed correction of the high inflation rates which in general started in the mid-1990s. This was mostly due to structural issues in their economies such as the populist political culture, persistent and substantial fiscal and current account deficits, which sometimes existed in parallel to fixed exchange rate regimes, deteriorating terms of trade for commodity exporters, and supply side issues compared to industrial economies. Efforts to contain inflation in these economies also resulted in serious output losses during the period from 1989 to 1994, amidst civil wars, in some cases.

1 In July 1944, delegates from 44 countries met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, United States to agree on the Bretton Woods System, where gold was determined as the basis for the United States dollar and other currencies were pegged to the United States dollar value.

PeriodReasons for High Inflation

1973 - 1982Two oil price surges; first due to an embargo by the Organisation of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC), and second due to the decline in oil production caused by the Iranian Revolution and Iran-Iraq War.

2008Global demand driven factors, including increased food prices and tripled oil prices during the period from 2004 to 2008 which was also contributed by the spillover effects of extra loose monetary policy conditions in the United States.

Current episode (since 2021)COVID-19 pandemic related disruptions to supply chains, increased energy and commodity prices, increased fertiliser prices, disturbances due to elevated geopolitical tensions and reviving demand conditions due to normalising activity.

The downward trend in global inflation discontinued for a while in the early 2000s until economies were heading towards the Global Financial Crisis, when global energy prices and food prices were soaring. This was particularly due to rapid growth in emerging and developing economies that relied mostly on commodity-intensive economic growth. Strong demand persistently pushed energy prices and food prices upward until they collapsed with the financial crisis. The energy price surge was mostly driven by sluggish supply performances where the production and distribution capacity were slow to build-up as a response to rapidly increasing demand. Food prices also contributed to the prevailing high inflation, alongside demand from emerging and developing economies, and a number of other factors, including unfavourable weather conditions and growing use of export restrictions by food exporters, such as export restraints implemented by major grain exporting countries, including China, Ukraine, and Argentina.

However, in aftermath of the crisis, inflation reached low levels, where the global annual average median inflation reached 2.6 per cent by 2017. Particularly, about half of the advanced economies reported negative inflation rates in 2015, and every three out of four advanced economies reported low single digit inflation (Jongrim Ha et al., 2019). In emerging markets and developing

economies, including those that were practicing inflation targeting, disinflation was prominent, and every three out of five economies recorded inflation rates below the target level.

High Inflation Episode since 2021

The current high inflation episode appears to be far wider and more persistent than previous episodes as it was triggered by several cost driven, and demand driven factors in combination. Supply side disruptions to major commodities, including energy related and agricultural commodities, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain issues, shortage of labour and increased demand for goods and services arising from normalisation of activity from the pandemic are the key contributors to this episode. Geopolitical tensions over the Russia-Ukraine war since late February 2022 pushed inflation trajectories further up on multiple fronts stemming from uncertainty, and commodity price hikes also contributed to inflation.

Along with these supply related causes of inflation, ample policy stimuli provided by monetary and fiscal authorities across the globe as well as additional policy support from the multilateral organisations to support the economies during the pandemic appears to have fueled inflation further, causing inflation originated from supply factors to persist for longer than initially anticipated. The combined effects of these forces lead to inflation recording several folds higher than the inflation targets and historical averages in many economies, regardless of economic status. Accordingly, in 2021, global inflation reached a near 14-year high. The United States experienced the highest inflation in 40 years with a year-on-year increase in the Consumer Price Index recording 7.9 per cent in February 2022. By February 2022, recording 6.2 per cent and 5.9 per cent

increases over the last 12 months, the United Kingdom and New Zealand economies also experienced the highest level of inflation recorded in last three decades. The trend is set to continue as the leading economies, as well as the emerging market economies are expected to experience inflationary pressures in 2022 as well. Inflation in the Eurozone too mounted to a record high of about 5.0 per cent in 2021.

At the outset of the current high inflation episode, it was a widespread belief that these inflationary pressures are temporary, hence the need to respond through monetary policy would not arise as it could hamper growth recovery in the post-pandemic period. However, inflation worldwide is expected to persist for a longer period at a greater magnitude, than previously envisioned by global think tanks, due to ongoing supply chain disruptions and high energy prices. This made policymakers rethink prioritising

stability over economic growth, and most central banks from advanced, emerging and developing economies commenced unwinding policy stimuli and started adopting a hawkish stance by tightening policy interest rates sharply and communicating their commitment for further tightening through forward guidance to fight inflation. The resultant tight global financial conditions are anticipated to contain global inflation back to the desired level with a policy lag. In addition to demand side measures, some countries are seeking possibilities of implementing certain supply side measures, such as change in conventional agricultural practices expecting to maintain realistic buffer stocks and revising import policies to avoid price rises of essential commodities.

supported by appropriate fiscal policies by governments. Central banks increase policy interest rates to increase the cost of borrowings and thereby discourage aggregate consumer spending. On the fiscal front, governments reduce inflationary pressures by increasing taxes and reducing government spending to address the demand-pull inflation. Also, price controls and subsidies play a major role in minimising the cost of production in controlling cost push inflation.

More importantly, transparent and independent central banks have been able to reduce inflation at a faster rate by anchoring inflation expectations through established credibility among economic stakeholders. Numerous assessments on the impact of central bank independence on macroeconomic stability support the assertion of a negative relationship between the central bank independence and inflation (Brumm 2002, 2011; Garriga and Rodriquez 2020; Berger, de Haan, and Eijffinger 2001). Empirically, central bank transparency has also been found to help anchor inflation expectations in advanced economies, thereby stabilising inflation and reducing uncertainty in inflation. (Weber 2016). Overall, appropriate stabilisation policies such as strengthening institutions, greater autonomy in central banking, and establishing an appropriate fiscal environment help decelerate structurally persistent inflation. Moreover, such policy commitments have been instrumental in successfully handling intermittent

supply driven inflationary pressures as these pressures are perceived to be transitory by economic agents with well anchored expectations.

When investigating historical inflationary trends, it can be observed that compared to developed and emerging economies, many developing or low income countries have experienced high unvarying inflation over time. Therefore, it is a significant challenge for central banks in these countries to achieve low and stable inflation and to anchor inflation expectations. Although inflation in developing countries is more susceptible to external shocks such as energy prices and food prices, some of the reasons adduced for the sustained and persistent inflation rates in many developing countries are structural, including high budget deficits and financing such deficits by the central bank, high government expenditure, high military expenditure, low productivity, frequent weather shocks, high persistent inflation expectations by the economic agents, excess money supply and unstable exchange rates.

Figure B 8.3 shows the impact of global factors in driving inflation in domestic core inflation, which measures the underlying demand driven component of inflation, across countries.

Tight monetary and fiscal policies and control prices have helped control inflation; the impact of inflationary pressures was reduced via safety net interventions such

as cash transfers and food subsidies, at times to some extent. In many developing economies, active use of countercyclical policies including fiscal rules have aided insulation of economies from the impact of global shocks.

High Inflation Episodes in Sri Lanka

The Sri Lankan economy also has not been an exception to global inflation dynamics, cost push factors and structural limitations in demand management. Sri Lanka, too experienced, high inflation episodes during several periods due to transitory supply side disruptions, especially weather related, and surge in international commodity prices together with the lagged effect of monetary expansion largely to support deficit financing. Nevertheless, Sri Lanka maintained low and stable levels of inflation for over a decade, abetted by continuous improvements to policy formulation and policy communication, while addressing supply concerns temporarily through government intervention by reducing certain taxes on essential commodities, importation of certain commodities, imposing maximum retail prices for certain commodities, even within the limited fiscal space. The Central Bank has deployed monetary policy measures to contain demand driven inflationary pressures. Adopting a flexible inflation targeting (FIT) monetary policy framework aids the Central Bank to conduct monetary policy in an increasingly forward looking manner with the aim of maintaining inflation at low and stable levels in the medium term, thereby supporting to attain sustainable economic growth while ensuring Central Bank transparency and accountability. Since FIT involves the aim of achieving the envisaged inflation targets, which can be closely monitored through inflation forecasts, the monetary policy decision making process is facilitated by a forward looking model based comprehensive analysis on the deviations of the inflation forecasts from the desired targets. Therefore, shocks to such deviations can be addressed through proactive policy measures in a timely manner to bring inflation back to the desired target levels, while properly anchoring inflation expectations.

Similar to many countries across the globe, Sri Lanka is currently experiencing high levels of inflation. In addition to COVID-19 provoked circumstances, the recent acceleration in inflation was driven by supply

side factors stemming from international commodity prices, which include fuel and some essential imported commodities. The removal of price controls and their spillover effects and the buildup of demand driven inflationary pressures stemming from pandemic related policy stimulus measures also contributed to inflation. Reflecting growing pressures from underlying demand conditions, core inflation, which does not capture volatile food prices, energy and transport costs, witnessed an increasing trend similar to other countries. Such demand driven pressures are taken care of through proactive policy measures taken by the Central Bank and the policy communication to reiterate commitment to revert inflation to the targeted range at the earliest. As such, the Central Bank increased policy rates in an aggressive manner, while devising preemptive policies to ensure that inflation returns to the targeted level at the fastest possible pace with minimal disruptions to economic recovery. Nonetheless, the government’s intervention also remains vital to overwhelm the supply side concerns, while enabling monetary policy driven measures to arrest excessive inflationary pressure in the economy, and hence robust and coordinated policies are required to be adopted in a timely manner. The intervention of the Central Bank is vital to contain inflationary pressures building up from speculation by economic agents, and hence inflation expectations. It is important to have a mechanism established by the government, to detect early and take proactive policy decisions to contain any adverse inflationary developments arising from supply side disturbances. Such a policy mix is crucial for any country that wishes to quickly move back to targets to enjoy the luxury of stable and healthy levels of inflation, thereby ensuring sustainable economic growth which ensures high living standards of the public.

and bakery products, along with increases in the

prices of non-food items such as health, restaurants

and hotels, etc. contributed to the acceleration

of core inflation in the latter part of 2021. The

movements in core inflation were reflecting the

gradual build-up of demand pressures underpinned

by the significant fiscal and monetary policy stimuli

provided during the pandemic. Year-on-year

core inflation based on the CCPI accelerated from

3.5 per cent at end 2020 to 8.3 per cent by end 2021

and accelerated further to 13.0 per cent in March

2022, while annual average core inflation was at

4.4 per cent in 2021 compared to 3.1 per cent

recorded in 2020. Core inflation based on the

NCPI also accelerated from 4.7 per cent at end

2020 to 10.8 per cent, year-on-year, by end

2021 and further to 14.1 per cent in February

2022. The annual average core inflation at

5.5 per cent in 2021 compared to 4.1 per cent

recorded in 2020. The actual and anticipated

movements in core inflation prompted the Central

Bank to take preemptive monetary policy measures

to tighten monetary conditions with the view of

arresting demand driven inflationary pressures and

anchoring inflation expectations.

Inflation expectations of both the corporate

and household sectors as gauged by the

Inflation Expectations Survey of the Central

Bank, remained elevated during 2021 induced

by the movements in actual inflation. As per the

survey findings, both the corporate and household

sectors expect inflation to trend upwards in the near

term owing to supply side disturbances. Changing

global and domestic supply and demand conditions

and the pandemic related mobility restrictions,

increase in money supply, possible depreciation

of the rupee, restrictions on imports, high demand

during festive seasons, expansionary fiscal policy

stance, possible increase of fuel and gas prices,

increase in global commodity prices and imported

items, drop in domestic supply especially due to

fertiliser restrictions, and the expected recovery

in the domestic economy were the most cited

reasons by survey respondents for the increase

in inflation expectations. In view of the monetary

policy actions of the Central Bank and the resultant

increase in interest rates, during the latter part of the

year, inflation expectations of the corporate sector

for the forthcoming period followed a decreasing

trend, which also reflects improvements in supply

conditions and relaxation of import restrictions as

cited by the survey respondents.

Market Liquidity and Short-Term Interest Rates

Rupee liquidity in the domestic money

market, which recorded a substantial surplus

until mid-2021, decreased significantly

reaching a large deficit level by end 2021.

Although the purchasing of government securities

by the Central Bank at primary market auctions and

the direct allocation of Treasury bills to the Central

Bank injected a sizeable quantum of rupee liquidity

into the domestic money market, several other

factors caused a decline in liquidity during 2021.

the public from the banking system, and maturities

of foreign currency buy-sell swaps with domestic

banks led to a continued reduction in liquidity in

the domestic money market, causing a marginal

deficit level by mid-August 2021. Liquidity in the

domestic money market further decreased with the

permanent liquidity absorption due to the increase

in SRR applicable on all rupee deposit liabilities

of LCBs by 2 percentage points to 4.0 per cent

in September 2021. At the same time, following

the tightening of the monetary policy stance by

mid-August 2021, the Central Bank commenced

open market operations to absorb excess liquidity

from the market, with the view to steering the

short term market interest rates. Meanwhile,

the Central Bank conducted long-term reverse

repo auctions, as needed, to inject liquidity on a

longer term basis to ease the liquidity stress in

some banks. Intervention in the domestic foreign

exchange market by the Central Bank to provide

foreign exchange to facilitate uninterrupted import

of essentials also caused a reduction in market

liquidity. Given these developments, daily average

liquidity in the domestic money market, that

recorded a surplus of around Rs. 137 billion during

the first half of 2021, declined to a deficit of around

Rs. 205 billion during the fourth quarter of 2021.

By end-March 2022, the deficit in overnight

liquidity in the domestic money market further

increased and reached high levels exceeding

Rs. 600 billion.

Reflecting the impact of the change in the

monetary policy stance in mid-August 2021

and large deficit liquidity levels, the Average

Weighted Call Money Rate (AWCMR), which

is the operating target of the monetary policy

framework, reached the upper bound of the

Standing Rate Corridor. The AWCMR, which

remained closer to the lower bound of the Standing

Rate Corridor at the beginning of 2021, increased

gradually towards the middle of the Standing Rate

Corridor with the gradual reduction in liquidity in the

domestic money market from the second quarter of

2021. Further, with the tightening of the monetary

policy stance commencing August 2021, the

AWCMR was allowed to adjust towards the upper

bound of the Standing Rate Corridor. Accordingly,

the AWCMR increased by around 240 basis points

since August 2021 and reached 7.49 per cent by

end-March 2022, in comparison to the cumulative

policy rate adjustment of 200 basis points since

August 2021. Meanwhile, weighted average rates

on transactions in the repo market also closely

followed the movements of the AWCMR, recording

7.50 per cent by end-March 2022.

Yields on Government Securities

Yields on government securities, which

declined notably during 2020, recorded a

significant increase during 2021 in view of

the increased borrowing requirement of

the Government, amidst the change in the

monetary policy stance and the removal of

higher reliance of the Government to borrow from

domestic sources caused upward pressures on the

yields on government securities throughout 2021.

However, the prevalence of maximum yield rates

for acceptance at primary auctions of government

securities helped contain the increase in yields on

government securities. Nevertheless, subsequent to

the increase in policy rates in mid-August 2021, and

the removal of maximum yield rates for acceptance

at primary auctions of government securities in

mid-September 2021, a notable increase in the yields

on government securities was observed. A further

notable increase in yields was observed in early

2022, reflecting the deteriorating investor sentiment

on account of fiscal sector difficulties amidst the

large borrowing requirement of the Government and

its impact on overall economic activity, and policy

rate increases undertaken in the first quarter of 2022.

Accordingly, the primary market yields on Treasury

bills increased by a range of 723-823 basis points

across all tenures during the period from end 2020

till end-March 2022. With the removal of maximum

yield rates for acceptance at primary auctions of

government securities, market appetite increased,

and larger shares of Treasury bill issuances were

subscribed by market participants. However, the

majority of the Treasury bills that were subscribed

by the market during 2021, especially during the

latter part of the year, were from the maturity bucket

of 91 days, highlighting the preference of investors

towards short term investments amidst perceived

uncertainty. Primary market yields on Treasury

bonds issued from the beginning of 2021 till

end-March 2022 also increased by a range of

223-876 basis points across all tenures. Secondary

market yields on government securities also

recorded substantial increases across all maturities

during the same period. Accordingly, during the

period from end 2020 to end March 2022, secondary

market yields on Treasury bills increased by a range

of 740-746 basis points across all tenures, while the

increase in the secondary market yields on Treasury

bonds was in the range of 758-855 basis points.

Meanwhile, the Government raised funds through

US dollar denominated Sri Lanka Development

Bonds (SLDBs) at various fixed rates in the range

of 5.00-10.00 per cent during 2021 and 2022 till

end-March 2022.

Deposit and Lending Interest Rates

Deposit interest rates of LCBs, which

declined notably until August 2021 in response

to policy and regulatory measures taken by

the Central Bank to ease monetary conditions,

increased at a relatively slow pace following the

tightening of monetary policy in August 2021. The

Average Weighted Deposit Rate (AWDR)1 and the

2021. Further, the Average Weighted New Deposit

Rate (AWNDR)3 and the Average Weighted New

lowest levels of 4.77 per cent in April 2021 and

4.90 per cent in May 2021, respectively. Accordingly,

the average deposit interest rates had decreased

tightening of monetary conditions, all deposit rates

points during this period. It was observed that the

pace of increase in deposit interest rates was slow

compared to the increase in market lending rates.

Furthermore, some deposit products of the banking

sector recorded negative real interest rates during

the latter part of 2021 as the upward adjustment

in market deposit rates was overshadowed by the

increase in the rate of inflation.

February 2022, AWLR across a number of security

types remained lower than the rates observed

by end 2020 despite the tightening of monetary

policy commencing August 2021, highlighting the

impact of the outstanding stock of loans and the

space available for further upward adjustment of

market lending rates, in the period ahead. When

loans to small and medium sized enterprises

(SMEs) as measured in the monthly SME Credit

Survey8 are considered, average interest rates

on loans to the SME sector by licensed banks

indicated the trend of overall average lending

rates of LCBs, but remained higher. Accordingly,

the Average Weighted SME Lending Rate

(AWSR)9 and the Average Weighted New SME

Lending Rate (AWNSR)10 reached 10.49 per cent

and 10.04 per cent, respectively, by end 2021.

In view of tightened monetary conditions, several

maximum interest rates applicable on lending

products were also revised upwards. Accordingly,

the interest rate applicable on the special

mortgage-backed housing loan scheme for

salaried employees introduced in December 2020

was changed from the fixed rate of 7 per cent per

annum for the first five years of the loan to a variable

rate linked to monthly AWPR. Further, given

tightened monetary conditions, caps imposed in

August 2020 on interest rates of domestic lending

products were revised upwards in March 2022,

where the maximum interest rate applicable to

credit cards was increased to 20 per cent per

annum; on pre-arranged temporary overdrafts

increased to 18 per cent per annum; and on

pawning facilities increased to 12 per cent per

annum, which were subsequently removed

entirely in April 2022.

somewhat. However, with the gradual increase

in interest rates on rupee denominated deposit

products following the tightening of the monetary

policy stance in August 2021, the cap for foreign

currency deposit interest rates was also revised to

better reflect market conditions and subsequently

removed in March 2022. Accordingly, interest rates

on US dollar denominated savings deposits were

in the range of 0.03-4.60 per cent by end 2021,

compared to the range of 0.03-4.00 per cent at

end 2020. Interest rates pertaining to savings

deposits denominated in pound sterling remained

unchanged in the range of 0.03-3.00 per cent by

end 2021, compared to end 2020. Meanwhile,

interest rates on time deposits denominated in

US dollars were in the range of 0.02-7.00 per cent

by end 2021, in comparison to the range of

0.10-6.00 per cent recorded at end 2020. Further,

interest rates applicable on pound sterling

denominated time deposits were in the range of

0.02-5.75 per cent by end 2021, compared to the

range of 0.05-4.25 per cent at end 2020.

7.5 Movements in Money and

Credit Aggregates

Reserve Money

Reserve money, which reflects the monetary

base of the economy, recorded a notable growth

during 2021 reflecting the increase in currency

in circulation and the impact of the increase in

the SRR. Reserve money grew by 35.4 per cent,

year-on-year, by end 2021, compared to the

expansion of 3.4 per cent recorded at end 2020.

In absolute terms, reserve money increased by

Rs. 341.4 billion during 2021 to Rs. 1,305.8 billion

by end 2021, compared to the increase of

Rs. 31.8 billion during 2020. Accordingly, currency

in circulation remained at elevated levels during the

year with high precautionary demand for currency

The Legal Rate and the Market Rate of

Interest,11 as determined by the Monetary Board

and published in the Government Gazette at

the end of each year, were at 7.48 per cent per

annum for 2022, compared to 10.12 per cent

per annum for 2021. The Legal Rate and the

Market Rate for 2022 were computed based on

simple averages of monthly AWDR and AWLR of

LCBs, which prevailed during the preceding twelve

months from November 2020 to October 2021.

Interest Rates on Foreign Currency Deposits

Reflecting the increased competition among

banks to mobilise foreign currency deposits

amidst constrained liquidity in the domestic

foreign exchange market, interest rates on

foreign currency deposits recorded a sharp

upward trend, which also required imposing

certain measures to correct anomalies between

foreign exchange and rupee interest rates. With

the recovery of the global economy along with the

support of vaccination programmes, monetary

policy in many countries commenced tightening,

mainly as a result of rising inflationary pressures. In

view of tightening global interest rates, along with

the liquidity conditions prevailing in the domestic

foreign exchange market, certain interest rates

on domestic foreign currency deposits offered

by licensed banks were notably high, thereby

creating interest rate anomalies between domestic

and foreign currency deposit products. Hence, a

maximum interest rate was imposed by the Central

Bank on foreign currency deposits interest rates of

LCBs and NSB in late August 2021 in order to iron

out such interest rate anomalies, and as a result,

foreign currency deposit interest rates, eased

11 The Legal Rate is defined under the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 6 of 1990, and is applicable to any action for the recovery of a sum of money. The Market Rate is defined under the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No. 2 of 1990, and applies only in relation to actions instituted by lending institutions for the recovery of debt exceeding Rs. 150,000 arising out of commercial transactions, where there is no agreed rate of interest.

by the public amidst the pandemic and associated

lockdowns and also partly reflecting the economic

activity returning to normalcy and relatively low

interest rates offered for deposits. Accordingly,

currency in circulation increased by Rs. 170.3 billion

during the year to Rs. 1,005.1 billion by end 2021,

over the Rs. 156.8 billion increase during 2020. The

large increase in money released to the economy

indicates the extra accommodative monetary policy

conducted in the eight months ending August 2021.

Meanwhile, following the upward adjustment to the

SRR by 2 percentage points in September 2021,

the deposits of LCBs maintained at the Central

Bank also increased notably. Accordingly, by end

2021, deposits of LCBs with the Central Bank

recorded a notable expansion of Rs. 171.1 billion

to Rs. 300.7 billion.

Based on the assets side of the Central Bank

balance sheet, the expansion in reserve money

was entirely due to the increase in net domestic

assets (NDA) of the Central Bank, while net

foreign assets (NFA) of the Central Bank

declined notably during 2021. The expansion in

NDA of the Central Bank was mainly on account

of the increase in the net credit to the government

(NCG), which increased by Rs. 1,225.2 billion in

2021 compared to the increase of Rs. 505.9 billion

during 2020. This reflects a substantial increase

in the Central Bank’s holdings of government

securities (net of repurchase transactions) due

to purchasing of Treasury bills at primary market

auctions, and the direct allocation of Treasury

bills to the Central Bank. Accordingly, the

holdings of government securities by the Central

Bank rose substantially by Rs. 1,228.1 billion to

Rs. 1,945.4 billion during 2021. Meanwhile,

amidst the gradual recovery of economic activity,

the Central Bank’s claims on LCBs declined

with the repayment of concessionary loans that

were extended by the Central Bank through

LCBs to support pandemic hit businesses and

individuals. As a combined result, NDA of the

Central Bank increased by Rs. 1,255.4 billion

during 2021 compared to the increase of

Rs. 401.1 billion in the previous year. Meanwhile,

NFA of the Central Bank contracted notably by

Rs. 914.0 billion to negative levels during 2021.

Foreign currency assets of the Central Bank

declined during the year mainly due to the foreign

currency debt service payments by the Central

Bank on behalf of the Government, including the

repayment of the maturing repurchase agreement

of US dollars 1.0 billion with the Federal Reserve

Bank of New York in two legs in February and

March 2021, and the settlement of the International

Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) of US dollars 1.0 billion

that matured in July 2021, while foreign currency

liabilities of the Central Bank increased during this

period. In addition, the Central Bank continued to

supply foreign currency to the domestic foreign

exchange market from its international reserves

portfolio in order to facilitate the payments of

essential imports.

The money multiplier, which is the ratio

between broad money supply (M2b) and reserve

money, declined in 2021 as a result of the

significant expansion in reserve money, which

outweighed the impact of the expansion of

broad money supply (M2b). Accordingly, the money

multiplier based on broad money (M2b) decreased to

8.15 by end 2021 from 9.75 recorded at end 2020.

Meanwhile, the currency to deposits ratio increased

to 8.0 per cent by end 2021 from 7.3 per cent

recorded at end 2020, while time and savings

deposits held by the public increased comparatively

at a slower pace over the preceding year.

Broad Money (M2b) and Domestic Credit

In spite of the continued expansion of

domestic credit, the growth of broad money

supply (M2b) moderated towards the latter part

of 2021 due to the contraction in NFA of the

banking system. Accordingly, the year-on-year

growth of M2b decelerated to 13.2 per cent

by end 2021, compared to the growth of

23.4 per cent recorded at end 2020. The overall

stock of M2b increased by Rs. 1,241.6 billion

to Rs. 10,647.3 billion by end 2021, from

Rs. 9,405.7 billion level at end 2020. As the key

source of M2b, NDA of the banking system increased

by Rs. 2,014.1 billion during 2021 mainly driven by

the increase in domestic credit, while NFA of the

banking system contracted by Rs. 772.5 billion

during the year.

In terms of the liabilities side of M2b, the

increase in time and savings deposits held by

the public with LCBs largely contributed to the

monetary expansion during 2021, although a

moderation was observed compared to the

previous year. Accounting for about 77 per cent

of the expansion of M2b during the year, time

and savings deposits of LCBs increased by

Rs. 958.8 billion in 2021, compared to the

significant increase of Rs. 1,469.9 billion recorded

in 2020. The moderation in funds placed in time and

savings deposits in 2021 was due to the notable

decline in market deposit rates, thereby slowing the

year-on-year growth of time and savings deposits

of LCBs to 11.7 per cent by end 2021, compared

to 21.7 per cent at end 2020. Meanwhile, with the

resurgence of pandemic-related uncertainties in

2021, demand deposits and currency held by the

public (which reflects narrow money, M1) expanded

by Rs. 282.7 billion during the year, compared to the

increase of Rs. 311.7 billion in 2020. Accordingly,

the year-on-year growth of M1 moderated to

24.0 per cent by end 2021, compared to the notable

growth of 36.0 per cent at end 2020.

Viewed from the assets side of M2b,

continuing the trend observed during 2020,

NFA of the banking system contracted during

2021 due to the notable decline in NFA of

the Central Bank, despite the improvement

observed in NFA of LCBs. NFA of LCBs

increased by Rs. 141.5 billion during 2021 over the

increase of Rs. 59.0 billion recorded in 2020 with

the expansion in NFA of both domestic banking

units (DBUs) and offshore banking units (OBUs).

NFA of DBUs increased by Rs. 45.6 billion, mainly

on account of the considerable increase in foreign

currency placements with banks abroad despite

the increase in foreign currency liabilities in terms

of deposit liabilities of non-residents. However,

reduced conversion of funds received in the form of

workers’ remittances to the banking system could

have stifled the possible improvement in NFA of

DBUs during 2021. In the meantime, NFA of OBUs

also increased by Rs. 95.9 billion in 2021 due to

increased lending to non-residents, along with the

notable decline in foreign borrowings.

NDA of the banking system continued to

expand notably during 2021, driven by the

increase in credit to both the public and the

private sectors. Amidst limited access to foreign

financing and the decline in government revenue,

the Government’s increased funding requirement

was met largely through the domestic banking

system, mainly the Central Bank. Continuing the

trend observed in 2020, NCG by the banking

system increased notably by Rs. 1,284.4 billion

in 2021, of which around 95 per cent was funded

by the Central Bank. Accordingly, NCG from the

Central Bank increased by Rs. 1,225.2 billion

during 2021. Meanwhile, provisional advances

provided to the Government by the Central Bank

declined to Rs. 150.1 billion in December 2021

from Rs. 198.2 billion recorded in early 2021 with

the repayment of the advances by the Government

following the revised budget estimates for

2021. Meanwhile, NCG by LCBs increased by

Rs. 59.2 billion in 2021 compared to the notable

increase of Rs. 1,246.3 billion in 2020, entirely

due to the increase in NCG by DBUs, while

NCG by OBUs recorded a contraction during the

year. Accordingly, NCG by DBUs increased by

Rs. 157.6 billion mainly due to investments in long

term government securities as well as the increase

in government overdraft balances provided

by state banks. NCG by OBUs declined by

Rs. 98.5 billion, compared to the increase of

Rs. 22.3 billion recorded in the previous year, on

account of the decline in direct foreign currency

loans to the Government, maturing of ISBs held by

LCBs, and reduced appetite towards reinvesting

in SLDBs following maturity amidst the limited

availability of foreign exchange within the banking

system.

Credit obtained by the State Owned

Business Enterprises (SOBEs) from the

banking system continued to expand in 2021,

reflecting their weak financial positions and

legacy issues. Accordingly, credit obtained by

SOBEs from the banking system increased by

Rs. 185.9 billion during 2021 following an increase

of Rs. 184.2 billion in 2020. Contributing largely to

the expansion of credit obtained by the SOBEs,

in cumulative terms, bank borrowing by the

Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) increased

by Rs. 123.5 billion in 2021. Meanwhile, bank

borrowing by the Road Development Authority

(RDA) increased by Rs. 24.5 billion during 2021,

while borrowing by the State Pharmaceuticals

Corporation (SPC) increased by Rs. 14.6 billion,

reflecting the increased financial need to facilitate

pandemic related medical expenses. In addition,

credit obtained by Ceylon Fertiliser Corporation

(CFC), Cooperative Wholesale Establishment

(CWE), SriLankan Airlines, National Water Supply

& Drainage Board (NWS&DB), and Ceylon

Electricity Board (CEB) also increased notably

during 2021. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Ports Authority

(SLPA), Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) and Urban

Development Authority (UDA) made repayments to

LCBs on a net basis during the year.

Credit extended to the private sector

expanded notably during 2021, reflecting

improved economic activity, buttressed by the

low interest rate environment. Accordingly, credit

extended to the private sector by LCBs increased by

Rs. 810.5 billion during 2021, compared to the

increase of Rs. 374.1 billion during 2020. Supported

by accommodative monetary conditions, the growth

of credit extended to the private sector by LCBs

expanded gradually until August 2021 recording

an expansion of about Rs. 624.6 billion during this

period. Some moderation in the growth of credit to the

private sector has been observed thereafter reflecting

the impact of tight monetary and liquidity conditions

in the market during the latter part of 2021. Possible

loan capitalisation with the extended debt moratoria

for COVID-19 affected businesses and individuals as

well as priority sector lending targets to licensed banks,

which were imposed in April 2021 to enhance credit

flows to the SME sector, may have also contributed

to the credit expansion during the year. Year-on-year

growth of credit extended to the private sector, which

grew by 6.5 per cent by end 2020, accelerated to

15.1 per cent by August 2021, before moderating to

13.1 per cent by end 2021.

As per the Quarterly Survey of Commercial

Banks’ Loans and Advances to the Private

Sector, growth of credit to major economic

sectors gathered pace during 2021 reflecting

improved economic activity, although some

moderation was observed in the growth of

personal loans and advances towards end

2021. Overall, the increase in credit to Industry (by

Rs. 340.4 billion) and Services (by Rs. 259.3 billion)

sectors contributed around 43 per cent and

33 per cent, respectively, to the overall

expansion of credit extended to the private

sector by LCBs during 2021, while the

increase in credit to Agriculture and Fishing (by

Rs. 53.9 billion) and Personal Loans and

Advances (by Rs. 130.1 billion) contributed around

7 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively. In

terms of sectoral performance, credit to the

Agriculture and Fishing sector recorded a growth of

11.0 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2021, compared

to the moderate growth of 3.9 per cent by end

2020. Within this sector, credit flows to the Paddy,

Rubber, Coconut, Vegetable and Fruit Cultivation

and Minor Food Crops, and Fisheries subsectors

recorded expansions during the year, while credit

granted to the Tea subsector contracted marginally

during 2021. Meanwhile, witnessing the recovery in

most economic activities, the Industry and Services

sector activities improved during 2021, recording

healthy credit flows to most subsectors. Accordingly,

growth of credit to the Industry sector accelerated

to 13.4 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2021 from

4.7 per cent at end 2020. Within the Industry

sector, credit to the Construction subsector, which

accounted for around 54 per cent of the total credit

flows to the Industry sector, recorded a notable

growth of 14.5 per cent, year-on-year, by end

2021. Credit to other subsectors, namely Textiles

and Apparel, and Food and Beverages also grew

notably by end 2021. The growth of credit extended

to the Services sector accelerated to 15.1 per cent,

year-on-year, by end 2021, compared to the

growth of 1.4 per cent at end 2020. Within the

Services sector, reflecting improved trade related

activities, credit to the Wholesale and Retail Trade

subsector grew by 9.6 per cent, year-on-year, by

end 2021, compared to the marginal contraction

reported at end 2020. Reflecting increased credit

flows to the tourism sector given the extended debt

moratorium facilities and other measures to boost

the industry during the pandemic along with its

recovery, credit to the Tourism subsector expanded

considerably and recorded a year-on-year growth

of 10.1 per cent by end 2021. Further, expansion

in the Services sector credit was also supported

by lending to Financial and Business Services and

Transport subsectors. Growth of credit in the form of

Personal Loans and Advances grew moderately by

8.0 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2021, compared

to the growth of 15.1 per cent at end 2020.

Contributing to the moderate expansion, growth

of credit granted under Consumer Durables

decelerated to 13.3 per cent, year-on-year,

by end 2021 compared to the notable growth

of 38.4 per cent at end 2020. Pawning related

advances recorded a notable growth of

18.6 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2021

reflecting the increased appetite for such credit

amidst increased gold prices and disruptions to

cashflows. Credit card advances also improved by

12.0 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2021, in

comparison to the contraction of 2.5 per cent at end

2020. Further, in terms of the maturity of outstanding

credit to the private sector by LCBs, an increase was

observed in short and medium term credit, while a

slowdown was observed in long term credit facilities,

possibly reflecting tight monetary conditions in the

economy towards the end of the year.

Broad Money (M4)

Following the similar trend in M2b, the growth

of broad money supply (M4), as measured by the

Financial Survey,12 decelerated by end 2021. The

year-on-year growth of M4, gradually decelerated

to 13.3 per cent by end 2021 from a growth of

21.4 per cent recorded at end 2020. Viewed

from the assets side, the expansion of M4 was

driven entirely by the expansion in NDA, within

which domestic credit by Licensed Specialised

Banks (LSBs) increased by Rs. 259.6 billion,

while that of Licensed Finance Companies

(LFCs) rose by Rs. 103.6 billion during 2021. The

expansion of total NCG based on M4 amounted

to Rs. 1,403.6 billion during the year, of which

12 The Financial Survey provides a broader measure of liquidity, covering all deposit taking institutions, including LSBs and LFCs, in addition to LCBs and the Central Bank.

Rs. 102.3 billion was through LSBs and

Rs. 16.9 billion was through LFCs. Further,

underpinned by the low interest rate environment,

credit extended to the private sector by licensed

banks and LFCs grew by 12.7 per cent,

year-on-year in 2021, from the growth of

6.3 per cent recorded in 2020. Credit extended

by LSBs to the private sector increased by

Rs. 157.3 billion in 2021, recording an annual

growth of 16.8 per cent, year-on-year. Meanwhile,

credit extended by LFCs to the private sector rose

by Rs. 86.7 billion in 2021, marking an annual

growth of 7.4 per cent, year-on-year. However,

overall NFA of M4 contracted by Rs. 781.5 billion

during 2021, with NFA of LSBs declining by

Rs. 9.0 billion during the year due to the increase in

foreign liabilities.

On the liabilities side of M4, the growth of

time and savings deposits held by the public

with licensed banks and LFCs moderated

by end 2021. Accordingly, the growth of time

and savings deposits as per M4 moderated to

11.6 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2021, compared

to the growth of 20.0 per cent at end 2020. Time

and savings deposits held with LSBs grew by

13.5 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2021, compared

to the growth of 21.6 per cent recorded in 2020.

However, time and savings deposits held with

LFCs grew by only 5.5 per cent, year-on-year, by

end 2021, compared to the marginal contraction of

0.7 per cent recorded during 2020. While the overall

growth of time and savings deposits as per M4

moderated due to the slowdown in the mobilisation

of interest bearing deposits by the banking sector,

some improvement was observed in the time and

savings deposits mobilised by LFCs during 2021.
