6.1 OverviewW

hile the country battled against the COVID-19 pandemic and multifaceted external sector

challenges, budgetary operations of the Central Government weakened in 2021 reflecting the

impact of deep rooted fiscal imbalances and unintended consequences of certain fiscal policy

measures. Mobilisation of government revenue as a percentage of GDP, which declined sharply in 2020,

further weakened to historic lows in 2021 with the revenue losses resulting from the pandemic induced subpar

economic performance and the continuation of the low tax regime instituted since late 2019. Meanwhile,

government expenditure remained unabated during the period under review, owing to higher expenditure

on account of salaries and wages and interest expenses along with the pandemic related outlays. Although

capital expenditure and net lending recorded a notable increase, public investments declined marginally

in 2021. Overall fiscal deficit further widened in 2021 while significantly deviating from the budgeted level

and reaching the highest level since 1988. With foreign financing avenues being limited with adverse global

market developments as well as sovereign credit rating downgrades, the Government was compelled to

rely mostly on the domestic banking sector, especially the Central Bank, to finance the budget deficit.

The Central Bank provided a substantial amount of funds to the Government to smoothen the functioning

of fiscal operations amidst the socio-economic challenges caused by the pandemic while maintaining an

accommodative monetary policy stance until August 2021 to maintain the borrowing cost at a lower level.

However, as excessive deficit financing through the banking sector is inflationary, a gradual phase out of

central bank financing and resorting to long term foreign financing options for deficit financing in an active

manner should be pursued to preserve monetary stability. Meanwhile, outstanding central government debt

grew to a disconcerting level by end 2021, both in nominal terms and as a percentage of GDP, and this growth

was a combined outcome of the widened fiscal deficit, increased market interest rates as well as the parity

variation, which was an outcome of exchange rate depreciation. A series of sovereign rating downgrades

by rating agencies occurred during 2021, in view of the deteriorating external liquidity position accentuated

by the reduction in foreign exchange reserves against high forthcoming debt repayments and inadequate

financing inflows. The fiscal sector outlook remains constrained with the lack of sufficient inflow of revenue,

sustainability concerns related to government debt, and deficit financing through domestic banking sources

amidst steady accumulation of debt, accelerated inflation, and vulnerabilities in the domestic financial

system stability and the external sector. Against this backdrop, strong fiscal consolidation measures remain

more vital than ever, particularly via revenue focused measures, in terms of introducing appropriate taxes

and broadening of tax base supplemented with strengthening the tax administration, in order to reverse the

dismal revenue mobilisation path, on a sustainable basis, while reducing government financing requirements.

Meanwhile, a tight rein on government expenses by refraining from ad hoc expenditure policies is essential

to ensure not derailing the fiscal consolidation path going forward. Accordingly, reducing the deficit in the

current account by streamlining recurrent expenditure while strengthening revenue mobilisation, and thereby

making concerted efforts with a credible plan to reach a surplus in the primary balance in the medium

term remains critical at this juncture to ensure sustainability of government debt. Implementing liability

management exercises in line with the Medium Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS), with necessary

revisions, and ongoing efforts on debt restructuring are also indispensable in smoothing debt repayments,

as well as lowering the near term risks to the fiscal sector.

the people from unforeseen catastrophes such as

the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, the Medium

Term Macro Fiscal Framework for 2021-2025

was aimed at increasing public investment to

5.4 per cent of GDP in 2021 while maintaining

public investments of over 5-6 per cent of GDP, on

average, in the medium term to facilitate high and

sustained economic growth. With the continuation

of the expenditure rationalisation measures,

recurrent expenditure was expected to remain at

around 14.2 per cent of GDP in 2021 and further

reduce to 12.3 per cent of GDP by 2025. With

these expected improvements, along with a higher

revenue collection of 14.2 per cent of GDP, the

budget deficit is expected to reduce to 4.0 per cent

of GDP in 2025. Meanwhile, it was expected that

the outstanding debt stock would be brought down

to 96.3 per cent of GDP in 2021 and further down to

75.5 per cent of GDP in the medium term. Reforming

State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) was also identified

as an integral part in reducing the pressure on fiscal

operations. Key fiscal targets announced for 2021

were, however, not materialised, since these targets

were driven by overoptimistic assumptions in the

context of a challenging economic environment

and policy inconsistencies that led to lower revenue

collection and rigid government expenses.

6.2 Fiscal Policy Measures1

The fiscal strategy of the Government as

envisaged in the Budget 2021 focused on

ensuring macroeconomic stability with the view

to fostering economic growth and development

of the country, though the anticipated fiscal

outcomes were not fully realised during 2021

primarily due to challenging macroeconomic

conditions and optimistic fiscal targets which

were not sufficiently buttressed by sufficient and

consistent policies. In line with the Government’s

fiscal strategy, the revenue collection was expected

to increase to 10.7 per cent of GDP in 2021, thereby

maintaining budget deficit and outstanding central

government debt at 8.8 per cent of GDP and

96.3 per cent of GDP, respectively, during 2021.

The medium term macro fiscal programme of the

Government was aimed at poverty alleviation

and economic revival, as envisaged within the

‘Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour’, the policy

framework of the Government. With higher

investments in economic and social infrastructure

of the Government, disparities are expected to be

minimised among the regions while safeguarding

During the year 2021, the commitment of

the Government to maintain a low tax regime

to promote swift economic recovery and

growth resulted in lacklustre performance

in government revenue. To this end, the tax

adjustments that have been instituted since late

2019 in relation to corporate income taxes, income

taxes at individual levels and Value Added Tax

(VAT) were maintained in 2021. Accordingly, the

Inland Revenue Act, No. 24 of 2017 was amended

in May 2021, incorporating revisions to taxes

which were announced in November 2019 and

other announcements made in January 2020 and

April 2021. In addition, several tax holidays were

granted on the gains and profits received by specific

start-ups after the completion of a two year period

from the implementation date. Accordingly, any

enterprise which sells recycled construction

materials in Sri Lanka, any business commenced

by an individual after the successful completion of

vocational education from any standardised and

acceptable institution for vocational education,

any enterprise set up by a resident person in

manufacturing of boats or ships in Sri Lanka, any

‘renewable energy project’ established with a

capacity to produce not less than one hundred Mega

Watts solar or wind power and supplied such power

to the national grid, and any enterprise initiated

by a resident person who constructs and installs

communication towers and related appliances

using local labour and local raw materials in Sri

Lanka or provide required technical services

for such construction or installation are allowed

to enjoy these tax holidays. Moreover, foreign

currency earnings of businesses that engage in

exporting gold, gems or jewellery, interest income

of multi-national companies, which are deposited

in foreign currency in any domestic bank, and

gains made by a person from the realisation of

lands or buildings, which were sold, exchanged or

transferred to a Sri Lanka Real Estate Investment

Trust (SLREIT) are exempted from income taxes

with effect from 01 April 2021, subject to the

provisions of the Inland Revenue (Amendment)

Act, No. 10 of 2021. Further, in March 2022,

Cabinet approval was granted to amend several

provisions in the Inland Revenue Act, No. 24 of

2017 in order to remove the complexity of such

provisions and accommodate requests of various

parties to increase tax compliance, while providing

reliefs for emerging sectors of the economy.

Meanwhile, the Value Added Tax Act, No. 14 of

2002 was amended in 2021, incorporating tax

revisions implemented since late 2019. During the

year, several specific enterprises/projects were

exempted from the Commodity Export Subsidy

Scheme (CESS) levy and Ports and Airports

Development Levy (PAL) to encourage exports

and foreign direct investments within the country.

Accordingly, any enterprise engaged in exporting

scrap/waste processed through manufacture of

exported goods, and the importation of goods by

any enterprise or a strategic development project,

with an investment of US dollars 50 million or above

in each stage during the project implementation

or construction period, were exempted from

CESS and PAL. Further, importation of medical

equipment was also exempted from PAL in order

to support the COVID-19 prevention programme.

Meanwhile, the Special Commodity Levy (SCL)

on the importation of several food items, such as

rice, potatoes, maize, dried fish, dairy products, big

onions and sprats was revised during the year to

provide necessary protection for farmers and as

supply side management measures to curtail the

increase in prices in the domestic market. Although

the aim of the aforementioned policies was to

revive economic activities faster, and in turn,

boost the revenue flows, the slow paced recovery

in economic activities adversely affected higher

government revenue in 2021.

During the year 2021 and early 2022, the

Government attempted to introduce several

measures aiming at reducing tax evasion

and minimising complexities in the tax

administration. Accordingly, measures were taken

to enact the legislation for tax amnesty under the

provisions of the Finance Act, No. 18 of 2021, which

inter alia provides for persons to voluntarily report

their undisclosed taxable supplies, income, and

assets for any taxable period ended on or prior to

31 March 2020, or in a return of income for any year

of assessment ended on or prior to 31 March 2020.

However, in the absence of strong enforcement

measures, revenue generated from tax amnesty

was limited to Rs. 174.6 million in 2021. Although

tax amnesties are implemented to meet short term

revenue shortfalls, such policies generally do not

create desirable outcomes as reflected in realised

data, and these policies may disincentivise law

abiding taxpayers and encourage corruption and

even, money laundering. Meanwhile, a bill was

presented to the Parliament in January 2022 to

impose a Special Goods and Services Tax (SGST)

as a composite tax in lieu of existing taxes on

liquor, cigarettes, vehicles (inclusive of parts for

assembling of vehicles), telecommunications,

and betting and gaming. The aim of the

imposition of SGST was to ensure the efficiency

in tax administration through the avoidance of

complexities associated with the application and

administration of multiple tax regimes on specified

goods and services. Nevertheless, considering

the petitions submitted against the SGST bill, the

Supreme Court determined that it needs to be

passed with a two-thirds majority in the Parliament

and a referendum due to the inconsistency of

several of its clauses with the Constitution. In

addition, several improvements were made to

tax administration, such as the mandatory use of

a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) in all tax

related source documents and making e-filing

compulsory for all limited liability companies.

Revisiting and simplifying the tax structure and

strengthening the tax administration remain

imperative at present to address the notable decline

in government revenue and improve government

finances on a long term basis.

The Government continued to channel

resources to offset the effects of the pandemic,

while supporting economically vulnerable

groups. Accordingly, the Government took

decisive measures to contain the spread of the

pandemic and to ensure the safety of the citizens,

while supporting livelihoods through the existing

social safety networks and accelerating the island

wide vaccination drive. In view of the increased

pressures of the pandemic on fiscal operations,

the Parliament approved a supplementary budget

of Rs. 200 billion in June 2021 to meet contingent

expenditure on account of the containment of the

COVID-19 pandemic within the already approved

borrowing limit of Rs. 2,997 billion for 2021.

Meanwhile, in January 2022, the Government

introduced a relief package of Rs. 229 billion with

the objective of minimising economic hardships

faced by the people due to the increase in prices

of goods and services. Under this relief package,

a monthly allowance of Rs. 5,000, which was not

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

taken into account for the calculation of pension

was granted to public officers and pensioners

with effect from January 2022, while a monthly

allowance was granted to Samurdhi beneficiaries

on a pro rata basis with a maximum limit of

Rs. 1,000 per month. In addition, several relief

measures are yet to be implemented, including

paying an additional Rs. 25 per kg of paddy to

farmers with the aim of increasing farmer income to

Rs. 75 per kg of paddy to compensate the income

losses associated with the expected production

losses in Maha season, providing each estate

sector family with 15 kg of flour at a subsidised

rate of Rs. 80 per kg, paying Rs. 5,000 to those

who cultivate homesteads encompassing less than

20 perches and Rs. 10,000 to those who cultivate

more than 20 perches and removing all taxes

on essential food items and medicinal products.

Although such extrabudgetary relief measures are

intended to provide assistance to the public, the

granting of reliefs in the absence of either non-debt

creating financing options or significant downward

adjustment in other expenditure, particularly at

the time of low government revenue mobilisation,

may possibly exacerbate the debt sustainability

concerns while instigating inflationary and external

sector pressures, which may eventually aggravate,

instead of ease, the burden on the public. Therefore,

such relief measures should be implemented with

due consideration of the impact of such policies on

the fiscal sector.

Given the continued increases in

government expenditure, shortfall in actual

revenue mobilisation and increased domestic

financing requirements, the borrowing limits as

well as milestones and fiscal rules related limits

were amended in 2021. Accordingly, a resolution

was approved by the Parliament to increase the

limit on Treasury bills to Rs. 3,000 billion from the

previous limit of Rs. 2,000 billion. In addition, the

Appropriation Act, No. 7 of 2020 was amended to

raise the gross borrowing limit by Rs. 400 billion

for 2021 to Rs. 3,397 billion in November 2021.

Meanwhile, the Fiscal Management (Responsibility)

Act, No. 3 of 2003 was also amended to shift the

timeline for achieving the debt to GDP target of 60

per cent to 2030 from 2020, and to increase the

limit on guarantees issued by the Government to

15 per cent of GDP from 10 per cent of GDP.

The Government continued to facilitate

State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), despite the

considerable burden on the central government

budget, and in many instances passing on the

burden to the state owned banks. Guidelines

were issued on corporate governance with the aim

of establishing a strategic framework for SOEs to

ensure transparency, fairness, accountability and

responsibility in line with international best practices.

These guidelines included provisions pertaining to

the duties of the Chairman and Boards of Directors

of SOEs and formation of their relationships with

stakeholders to safeguard public interest. Further,

an operational manual was issued to SOEs,

providing directions regarding their conduct of

business to accomplish their respective objectives

and improve their performance. Meanwhile, a

Management Committee on Investment was

appointed by the Cabinet of Ministers to facilitate

investments related to SOEs. Considering

the deteriorated financial performance of

SriLankan Airlines (SLA) amidst the pandemic,

the Government decided to infuse capital to SLA,

while issuing guarantees and a letter of comfort to

SLA in order to improve its financial viability. As a

result, two tranches totalling Rs. 27.7 billion were

issued to SLA in November 2020, and a further

Rs. 18.0 billion was issued in April 2021.

This was a part of the US dollar 500 million

capitalisation programme approved by the

Cabinet of Ministers on 26 October 2020.

FISCAL POLICY AND GOVERNMENT FINANCE

183

Moreover, the Government approved the

reissuance of all expired letters of comfort in favour

of two state banks, equivalent to US dollar 205.4

million and Rs. 27.6 billion, through the General

Treasury, in order to continue the provision of short

term credit facilities. In addition, two state banks

disbursed new working capital facilities totalling

US dollar 75 million in 2021 to SLA to provide

Treasury guarantees, based on the approval

of the Cabinet of Ministers. Considering the

mounting financial losses of the Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation (CPC) and the resultant burden on the

banking sector, the Government allowed revision

of CPC’s domestic petroleum prices in 2021 and

early 2022. However, implementing cost reflective

pricing mechanisms for key SOEs and restructuring

SOEs in a transparent manner to enhance their

efficiency remain a priority consideration for the

Government in order to minimise the fiscal burden

of such entities.

Recognising subpar performance in revenue

mobilisation, the Government introduced short

term revenue enhancement measures through

the Budget 2022. Accordingly, a bill amending the

Value Added Tax Act, No. 14 of 2002 to increase

the VAT rate from 15 per cent to 18 per cent on the

supply of financial services on financial institutions

with effect from 01 January 2022 was passed

by the Parliament in March 2022. Meanwhile,

as proposed in the Budget 2022, excise duty

on liquor and cigarettes was revised upwards

in November 2021. Surcharge Tax Act, No. 14

of 2022 was enacted with the aim of imposing a

retrospective one time surcharge tax of 25 per

cent on individuals, partnerships, and companies,

whose taxable income is calculated in accordance

with the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act,

No. 24 of 2017, where their taxable income exceeds

Rs. 2 billion for the tax assessment year,

commencing 01 April 2020. Although the proposed

one off retrospective taxes would help raising

government revenue for a given year, such tax

policies may not generate government revenue on

a sustained basis. In addition, uncertainties created

by such retrospective taxes may hamper investor

confidence and appetite.

In 2022, the Government introduced several

measures with the aim of managing public

expenditure, amidst the limited fiscal space

and the foreign exchange liquidity shortage

in the country. During the year, the Government

attempted to rationalise expenditure by curtailing

the expenses on purchasing of vehicles, buildings,

and other assets, suspending new constructions

of buildings for state institutions, while prioritising

public investments based on the economic benefits

of such investments. In line with the Budget 2022,

the Government announced various measures in

November 2021 to curtail expenses by reducing the

provisions for electricity of government institutions

by 10 per cent, reducing the telephone expenses

of government institutions by 25 per cent, reducing

fuel allowance provided to government ministers

and government officials by 5 litres per month, and

suspending the construction of new office premises

for a period of two years. However, such measures

may not be adequate to sizeably reduce mounting

government expenditure and thereby improve

government finances. Amidst the prevailing foreign

exchange liquidity shortages of the country,

several guidelines were issued by the Government

in March 2022 to limit the consumption of electricity

and fuel by the public sector by minimising the

usage of vehicles, elevators, air conditioners, and

other electrical appliances. Further, considering

increased life expectancy and the resultant

capacity to remain active in the public service, the

compulsory retirement age of the public officers was

extended up to 65 years with effect from 01 January

2022 with the view to strengthening the labour

force of the country and reducing the expenditure

related to retirement benefits. Meanwhile, the age

of compulsory retirement of employees of SOEs

was also extended up to 62 years with effect from

01 January 2022.

International sovereign credit rating

agencies downgraded the sovereign credit

ratings of Sri Lanka during 2021, in view of

declining foreign exchange reserves amidst

high external debt repayments and inadequate

financing inflows. Standard and Poor’s Global

Ratings (S&P) downgraded Sri Lanka’s sovereign

credit rating to ‘CCC+ (Negative)’ from ‘CCC+

(Stable)’ on 27 August 2021, and further to ‘CCC

(Negative)’ on 12 January 2022. Although Fitch

Ratings maintained its rating at ‘CCC’ status for

more than a year since 27 November 2020, they

too downgraded Sri Lanka’s sovereign credit

rating to ‘CC’ on 17 December 2021. Similarly,

Moody’s Investor Service also downgraded Sri

Lanka’s sovereign credit rating to ‘Caa2 (Stable)’

from ‘Caa1 (Stable)’ on 28 October 2021. Such

rating decisions were primarily driven by the

assessments on fiscal imbalances, challenges

faced by the country in meeting external

financing requirements, uncertain policy outlook,

and the risk of a slowdown in fiscal consolidation.

Nevertheless, the Government repaid all its

debt servicing obligations in 2021, including the

International Sovereign Bond (ISB) of US dollars

1,000 million, which matured on 27 July 2021,

and the ISB of US dollars 500 million, which

matured on 18 January 2022.

6.3 Government Budgetary Operations

Revenue and Grants

Revenue

Government revenue recorded a sluggish

growth in 2021 yielding the historically lowest

tax to GDP ratio amidst the low tax regime

instituted since late 2019. In 2021, in nominal

terms, government revenue grew by 6.5 per cent,

year-on-year, to Rs. 1,457.1 billion, benefiting

mainly from the higher tax revenue collection from

VAT, income taxes, PAL, and CESS. Tax revenue

increased by 6.7 per cent to Rs. 1,298.0 billion in

2021 from Rs. 1,216.5 billion in the preceding year.

Meanwhile, in 2021, non tax revenue increased

to Rs. 159.1 billion in 2021 from Rs. 151.4 billion

in 2020 due to the rise in revenue collection from

profit and dividend transfers from SOEs and social

security contributions, despite the reduction in

fees and charges, rent income, interest income

and distributable profits transferred from the

Central Bank. However, government revenue as a

percentage of GDP declined to 8.7 per cent in 2021

from 9.1 per cent in the previous year. Tax revenue

as a percentage of GDP, which stood at a low level

of 8.1 per cent of GDP in 2020, further declined to

7.7 per cent during 2021. Both government revenue

and tax revenue as a percentage of GDP declined

to a record low since independence, owing to the

impact of the continuation of the low tax regime,

import restrictions imposed to ease external sector

pressure, and the modest pickup of the economy.

Meanwhile, non tax revenue as a percentage of

GDP declined to 0.9 per cent in 2021 compared

to 1.0 per cent recorded in 2020, whereas grants

received by the Government recorded a marginal

improvement to Rs. 6.7 billion in 2021 in comparison

to Rs. 5.3 billion registered in 2020.

Revenue from income taxes increased by

12.6 per cent, in nominal terms, to Rs. 302.1 billion

in 2021 from Rs. 268.2 billion in 2020. This

reflects of increased revenue mobilisation from all

income tax categories, except for the Economic

Service Charge (ESC) which was abolished in early

2020. With the increased revenue from income

taxes, the share of direct tax revenue in the total

tax revenue collection improved to 23.3 per cent

in 2021 over 22.1 per cent recorded in 2020.

Revenue from corporate and non corporate

income taxes increased notably to Rs. 273.6 billion

in 2021 compared to Rs. 228.3 billion recorded

in the previous year, indicating the recovery of

economic activities in 2021 compared to the

preceding year and improved performance

mainly in corporates. Revenue collection from

Advance Personal Income Tax (APIT) and

Withholding Tax (WHT) increased slightly

during the period under review to Rs. 15.4 billion

and Rs. 12.4 billion, respectively, compared to

Rs. 15.0 billion and Rs. 10.0 billion, respectively,

in 2020. Meanwhile, the arrears collected on ESC

amounted to Rs. 0.7 billion in 2021, following the

removal of ESC in January 2020. As a percentage

of GDP, revenue generated from income taxes

remained at 1.8 per cent in 2021, broadly

unchanged from 2020.

Revenue collection from VAT increased

supported by the revival in economic activity

during the year. Accordingly, revenue collection

from VAT increased to Rs. 308.2 billion in 2021

compared to Rs. 233.8 billion in 2020. As a

percentage of GDP, VAT revenue increased to

1.8 of per cent in 2021 from 1.6 per cent in 2020.

VAT revenue generated on account of domestic

economic activities increased to Rs. 185.5 billion in

2021 from Rs. 148.1 billion in 2020, while revenue

from VAT on imports related activities increased

to Rs. 122.8 billion in 2021 from Rs. 85.7 billion

in 2020. During the year, the share of revenue

from VAT on total revenue and total tax revenue

increased to 21.2 per cent and 23.7 per cent,

respectively, compared to 17.1 per cent and

19.2 per cent, respectively, recorded in 2020.

Meanwhile, the arrears collected on Nation

Building Tax (NBT) amounted to Rs. 0.4 billion in

2021, following the abolition of NBT in December

2019.

Revenue collection based on excise duties

declined in 2021, reflecting the weakening of

excise revenue sources with the continuation

of restrictions on motor vehicle imports that

were imposed in view of foreign exchange

liquidity issues in the country. Accordingly,

in nominal terms, revenue from excise duties

declined to Rs. 306.9 billion in 2021 from Rs. 322.0

billion in 2020, while as a percentage of GDP,

excise duties mobilisation declined to 1.8 per cent

in 2021 compared to 2.1 per cent in the preceding

year. Revenue collection from excise duty on

motor vehicles declined to Rs. 18.1 billion in 2021

from Rs. 48.8 billion in 2020 and Rs. 130.4 billion

in 2019. Meanwhile, revenue from excise duty

on cigarettes and tobacco also declined to

Rs. 88.5 billion in 2021 from Rs. 94.3 billion in

2020. Revenue from excise duty on petroleum

products increased to Rs. 55.3 billion in 2021

from Rs. 53.1 billion in 2020 due to increased

refined petroleum imports during the period under

review. In addition, revenue from excise duty on

liquor also increased by 14.6 per cent to Rs. 138.6

billion in 2021 due to increased liquor production,

reflecting the recovery in hotel/ restaurant/tourism

related services amidst the pandemic related

disturbances.

Revenue from international trade related

taxes showed a mixed performance in 2021,

amidst the restrictions on the importation of

several nonessential items. Revenue collection

from Customs duties declined to Rs. 64.3 billion

in 2021, from Rs. 114.2 billion recorded in 2020.

Apart from the import restrictions, reduction of the

Customs duty rate from 30 per cent to 15 per cent on

selected items that was implemented in November

2020 in line with the simplification of the Customs

duty structure, also contributed to the decline

in revenue generated from international trade

activities. Meanwhile, revenue collection from SCL

also declined by 32.5 per cent to Rs. 55.8 billion in

2021 compared to Rs. 82.7 billion in 2020. Import

restrictions on several non-essential items, tax rate

reductions on dried fish, big onions and potatoes,

and the imposition of duty waivers on salt, rice,

desiccated coconut and maize caused the decline

in revenue mobilisation from SCL. On the other

hand, revenue from PAL and CESS levy increased

during the year, despite the import restrictions

on various non-essential items and exemptions

granted on medical equipment, projects related

goods, and selected items. Accordingly, revenue

from PAL increased to Rs. 154.1 billion in 2021

from Rs. 115.4 billion in 2020, while revenue from

CESS levy increased by 53.2 per cent to Rs. 75.5

billion in 2021 over 2020. Increase in rates on CESS

levy for selected items in line with the simplification

of the Customs duty structure in November 2020,

contributed to the rise in revenue collection from

CESS levy.

During the year, non tax revenue increased,

in nominal terms, reflecting the rise in revenue

collection from profit and dividend transfers

of SOEs and social security contributions.

Accordingly, non tax revenue increased to

Rs. 159.1 billion in 2021 from Rs. 151.4 billion

in 2020. Profit and dividend transfers of SOEs

increased by 73.6 per cent to Rs. 30.6 billion in

2021 compared to 2020, reflecting the impact of

the recovery of economic activities. Revenue

from social security contributions increased by

6.8 per cent, year-on-year, to Rs. 34.6 billion

during the period under review. However, revenue

from interest and rent income declined to Rs. 11.6

billion in 2021 in comparison to Rs. 19.4 billion

in 2020, while revenue from fees and charges

declined by 10.0 per cent to Rs. 42.6 billion in

2021. The distributable profits of the Central Bank

that were transferred to the Government in 2021

amounted to Rs. 15.0 billion compared to Rs. 24.0

billion in 2020.

Grants

Foreign grants received from bilateral and

multilateral sources increased to Rs. 6.7 billion

in 2021 from Rs. 5.3 billion in 2020. Foreign

grants from bilateral sources increased to Rs. 3.2

billion in 2021 from Rs. 2.8 billion in 2020, while

foreign grants from multilateral sources increased

to Rs. 3.5 billion in 2021 from Rs. 2.5 billion in

2020. The Government of Japan, the Asian

Development Bank (ADB), and the Department of

Agriculture of the United States were among the

major development partners who provided grants

during 2021.

Expenditure and Net Lending

During the year, total expenditure and net

lending increased owing to the increases in

both the recurrent expenditure, and capital

expenditure and net lending. Accordingly, total

expenditure and net lending increased significantly

by Rs. 480.7 billion to Rs. 3,521.7 billion (21.0 per

cent of GDP) in 2021 compared to Rs. 3,041.0

billion (20.2 per cent of GDP) recorded in 2020. In

2021, total expenditure and net lending accounted

for 99.9 per cent of the annual estimate for 2021

and 105.9 per cent of the revised annual estimate

for 2021. Recurrent expenditure increased

to Rs. 2,747.5 billion in 2021 compared to

Rs. 2,548.4 billion recorded in 2020, reflecting

higher expenses on account of salaries and

wages, and interest payments. During the period

under review, capital expenditure and net lending

also increased notably to Rs. 774.2 billion from

Rs. 492.6 billion in 2020.

In 2021, higher expenditure incurred on

account of salaries and wages and interest

payments contributed to the rise in recurrent

expenditure. Expenditure on salaries and

wages increased by Rs. 51.5 billion to Rs. 845.7

billion in 2021, compared to Rs. 794.2 billion

in 2020, partially due to the recruitment of low

skilled individuals from low income families and

unemployed graduates and the diploma holders

in September 2020, on top of the impact of

the annual increments in salaries and wages.

Expenditure on salaries and wages for 2021

accounted for 58.0 per cent of the government

revenue, and 30.8 per cent of the total recurrent

expenditure. Interest payments also rose by

6.9 per cent to Rs. 1,048.4 billion in 2021 from

Rs. 980.3 billion in 2020 reflecting the impact of the

rise in domestic interest payments, following the

increased interest payments on Treasury bonds.

Interest paid on Treasury bonds amounted to Rs.

593.4 billion in 2021 compared to Rs. 550.5 billion

in 2020 due to the increase in borrowings through

Treasury bond issuances by Rs. 1,248.4 billion

to Rs. 6,968.0 billion in 2021. Interest payments

accounted for 72.0 per cent of government

revenue in 2021 compared to 71.7 per cent in

2020, underlining the pressing concern of lack of

adequate revenue mobilisation at least to cover

the rigid recurrent expenditure of the Government.

Meanwhile, expenditure on subsidies and transfers

declined to Rs. 684.5 billion in 2021 from Rs. 717.1

billion in 2020 due to the reduction in subsidies to

the household sector because of the removal of

the fertiliser subsidy granted for chemical fertiliser

since the Yala season of 2021 and the reduction

in expenditure on subsidy programmes such as

subsidy for school and higher education season

tickets, financial support for elderly over 70 years

of age, etc. However, pension payments increased

by 4.7 per cent to Rs. 269.8 billion in 2021, while

expenditure in relation to Samurdhi payments

increased by 5.7 per cent to Rs. 55.4 billion in

2021 compared to 2020. Recurrent expenditure,

as a percentage of GDP, declined to 16.3 per cent

in 2021 compared to 17.0 per cent in 2020.

During 2021, capital expenditure and net

lending increased both in nominal terms and as

a share of GDP. Accordingly, capital expenditure

and net lending increased by 57.2 per cent to

Rs. 774.2 billion in 2021 over 2020, while capital

expenditure and net lending as a percentage

of GDP increased to 4.6 per cent in 2021 over

63.3 per cent registered in 2020. However,

capital expenditure declined to Rs. 767.6

billion in 2021 from Rs. 795.4 billion in 2020,

in the absence of the adjustment of arrears

payments of capital expenditure in 2020. Key Fiscal Balances and Financing the Budget Deficit

The key fiscal balances remained weak

in 2021 owing to lower government revenue

collection and the unabated government

expenditure. According to the fiscal sector statistics

of the Ministry of Finance, the overall budget deficit

as a percentage of GDP further weakened to

12.2 per cent (Rs. 2,057.9 billon) in 2021 from

11.1 per cent (Rs. 1,667.7 billion) reported in

2020. The current account deficit that reflects the

dissavings of the Government also remained high at

7.7 per cent of GDP (Rs. 1,290.4 billion) in

2021, broadly unchanged from 7.9 per cent

of GDP (Rs. 1,180.4 billion) reported in 2020.

Meanwhile, the primary deficit, which reflects

the effects of discretionary fiscal policy of

the current year and computed by excluding

interest payments from the overall budget

deficit, also weakened to 6.0 per cent of GDP

(Rs. 1,009.5 billion) in 2021, compared to 4.6 per

cent of GDP (Rs. 687.4 billion) registered in 2020.

The Government mainly relied on domestic

sources to finance the overall budget deficit

in 2021, reflecting its preference of the

Government to reduce the exposure to foreign

financing alternatives, amidst the limited access

to foreign sources. As per the Ministry of Finance,

net financing through domestic sources, which

includes all net borrowing through Treasury bills and

Treasury bonds, Offshore Banking Units (OBUs)

and Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs),

amounted to Rs. 2,071.8 billion and accounted

for 12.3 per cent of GDP in 2021 compared to

11.7 per cent of GDP in 2020. Meantime, the net

foreign repayment that includes net repayment of

ISBs stood at Rs. 13.9 billion.

During 2021, the deficit financing from

domestic sources, especially through the

banking sector, resulted in an upward pressure

on the yields on government securities and short

term money market rates. Government borrowings

from the banking sector accounted for 63.0 per

cent (Rs. 1,304.3 billion) of total net domestic

financing. Out of this quantum, the net central

bank financing stood at Rs. 1,225.2 billion.

Net financing from commercial banks amounted

to Rs. 79.1 billion in 2021. Meanwhile, financing

from the non-bank sector, which are considered

noninflationary sources, amounted to Rs. 767.5

billion with a share of 37.0 per cent of total

net domestic financing in 2021. In terms of

instruments, 62.8 per cent (Rs. 1,301.5 billion) of

the domestic financing was sourced from Treasury

bonds followed by 30.7 per cent (Rs. 635.1 billion)

and 16.6 per cent (Rs. 343.0 billion) from Treasury

bills and overdraft facilities, respectively. However,

borrowings from OBUs and SLDBs recorded net

repayments during 2021.

Total foreign financing recorded a

repayment of Rs. 13.9 billion, on net basis,

during 2021 along with the repayment of

Rs. 199.9 billion (US dollar 1 billion) for ISBs.

The net financing through the Foreign Currency

Term Financing Facility (FCTFF) were recorded at

Rs. 146.7 billion (US dollar 0.7 billion) during 2021,

as a result of new borrowings of Rs. 164.9 billion

(US dollar 0.8 billion) and repayment of Rs. 18.2

billion (US dollar 0.1 billion) during 2021.

6.4 Government Debt and Debt Service Payments

Central Government Debt

Continued high budget deficit resulting from

persistently weak fiscal performance, which

exacerbated during the pandemic times, led to

a substantial increase in outstanding central

government debt by end 2021. In nominal terms,

the total outstanding central government debt

stock increased to Rs. 17,589.4 billion at end 2021

from Rs. 15,117.2 billion recorded by end 2020.

With the increased financing requirements amidst

limited global market access due to unfavourable

international market conditions, global appetite

for safe haven assets and unappealing sovereign

credit ratings of Sri Lanka, and the reliance on

domestic sources for financing the budget deficit

triggered a notable change in the composition

of outstanding stock of central government

debt. Consequently, the share of domestic debt

increased to 63.1 per cent of the total outstanding

debt of the Central Government by end 2021

compared to 60.0 per cent recorded in the previous

year. Meanwhile, the quantum of foreign debt as a

share of total outstanding central government debt

declined to 36.9 per cent by end 2021 compared to

40.0 per cent recorded at end 2020. Reflecting the

subpar performance in the key fiscal variables, the

central government debt to GDP ratio increased to

104.6 per cent by end 2021 from 100.6 per cent

at end 2020. The share of domestic debt as a

percentage of GDP increased notably to 66.0 per

cent by end 2021 from 60.3 per cent at end 2020,

while the share of foreign debt as a percentage of

GDP decreased to 38.6 per cent at end 2021 from

40.3 per cent reported at end 2020. Moreover, the

level of foreign currency denominated debt as a

share of total outstanding central government debt

declined to 42.4 per cent by end 2021 from 47.5 per

cent that prevailed at end 2020, reflecting a higher

concentration towards financing budget deficit

through domestic sources as well as settlement

of foreign debt obligations including the ISB which

matured in 2021. However, the Average Time to

Maturity (ATM) of the outstanding total debt stock

declined to 5.2 years at end 2021 compared to 5.7

years at end 2020 due to increased borrowings

raised through short term debt instruments.

The total domestic debt of the Central

Government witnessed an increase of

Rs. 2,032.2 billion from end 2020, reaching

Rs. 11,097.2 billion by end 2021.2 With increased

reliance on short term financing amidst less market

appetite for longer tenure maturities of government

securities, particularly at the preannounced maximum

yield rates as well as the market expectations for

interest rate hikes, short term domestic debt stock

increased by 42.9 per cent to Rs. 3,139.8 billion by

end 2021 from Rs. 2,197.6 billion reported at end

2020. Accordingly, the share of short term debt in total

domestic debt stock also increased to 28.3 per cent

towards end 2021 from 24.2 per cent at end 2020.

In nominal terms, the increase in the short term

debt stock was largely driven by the increase in the

outstanding stock of Treasury bills, with a growth

of 40.1 per cent, to Rs. 2,270.5 billion at end 2021,

compared to Rs. 1,620.7 billion recorded at end

2020. Consequently, the share of Treasury bills in

total domestic debt stock as at end 2021 increased

to 20.5 per cent from 17.9 per cent at end 2020.

However, the outstanding debt stock on account

of provisional advances to the Government by

the Central Bank witnessed a marginal reduction

to reach Rs. 150.1 billion by end 2021 from

Rs. 153.1 billion at end 2020. As the Government was

compelled to depend more on short term instruments

for deficit financing during 2021, the share of medium

and long term debt in the total domestic debt stock

declined to 71.7 per cent from 75.8 per cent recorded

at end 2020. However, in nominal terms, the medium

and long term domestic debt stock also increased by

15.9 per cent to Rs. 7,957.4 billion by end 2021 from

Rs. 6,867.5 billion recorded at end 2020. Treasury

bonds, which continued to dominate the outstanding

domestic debt portfolio, accounted for about

62.8 per cent of the total outstanding domestic debt

stock during the year in comparison to 63.0 per cent

recorded at end 2020. In nominal terms, Treasury

bonds in the domestic debt increased by 21.9 per cent

to Rs. 6,966.2 billion compared to Rs. 5,713.3 billion

recorded at end 2020. Meanwhile, SLDBs holdings of

the residents declined to Rs. 455.2 billion (US dollars

2,271.1 million) from Rs. 486.9 billion (US dollars

2,611.9 million) reported at end 2020. In addition, the

ISBs owned by the domestic residents also declined

from Rs. 415.8 billion (US dollars 2,230.4 million)

at end 2020 to Rs. 372.6 billion (US dollars 1,859.0

million) by the end of 2021. This was mainly due to

the maturing of the ISB amounting to US dollars 1

billion, of which US dollars 371.3 million was repaid

to domestic bond holders. Moreover, outstanding

debt from OBUs recorded a decline of Rs. 88.1 billion

from end 2020 to Rs. 139.3 billion (US dollars 695.0

million) by the end of the year 2021. The outstanding

foreign currency denominated domestic debt at end

2021 decreased by Rs. 162.9 billion to Rs. 967.1

billion (US dollars 4,825.1 million) from Rs. 1,130.0

billion (US dollars 6,062.2 million) at end 2020.3

Meanwhile, debt obligation of the Central

Government to the domestic banking sector

3 Outstanding foreign currency denominated domestic debt includes SLDBs holding and ISBs holding of residents and the outstanding government debt held by the OBUs.

reaching Rs. 3,901.6 billion and Rs. 1,565.5 billion,

respectively. The significant increase in the central

government debt held by the Central Bank was due

to the increased Treasury bills holding amounting

to Rs. 1,391.3 billion during 2021 in comparison

to Rs. 654.6 billion in 2020. This was a result of

the subscription of Treasury bills by the Central

Bank at primary auctions amidst subdued market

subscription and administrative special allocations

of Treasury bills to the Central Bank. Meanwhile,

the outstanding debt owned by commercial banks

increased to Rs. 3,901.6 billion at end 2021 mainly

due to higher investments in Treasury bonds by

commercial banks in 2021. The stock of Treasury

bonds held by commercial banks increased to

Rs. 1,646.8 billion at end 2021 from Rs. 1,513.3 billion

reported at end 2020. However, the share of the

banking sector debt in total domestic debt declined

to 49.3 per cent by end 2021 from 52.2 per cent at

end 2020. Meanwhile, the outstanding government

debt stock held by the nonbank sector amounted

to Rs. 5,630.1 billion at end 2021 as against

Rs. 4,333.4 billion at end 2020.

The total foreign debt liability of the Central

Government, in nominal terms, increased

from Rs. 6,052.2 billion at end 2020 to

Rs. 6,492.2 billion by end 2021.4 However,

due to the limited access to foreign sources, the

explicit financing strategy of the Government

to rely primarily on domestic sources, and net

repayment of ISBs, the share of foreign debt in the

total outstanding debt stock declined to 36.9 per

cent at end 2021 from 40.0 per cent witnessed at

end 2020. Within the total foreign debt portfolio,

the share of non-concessional debt increased

to 52.3 per cent by end 2021 from 50.6 per cent

at end 2020 on account of increased receipt

of multilateral loans and foreign currency term

financing facility as well as the impact of the

depreciation of the rupee. In nominal terms, the

outstanding balance of the non-concessional debt

stock increased by 10.8 per cent to Rs. 3,394.6

billion at end 2021 from Rs. 3,064.1 billion recorded

at end 2020. Despite the repayment of US dollars

1.0 billion worth of ISB to both resident (US

dollars 371.3 million) and nonresident investors

(US dollars 628.7 million), the rupee value of the

ISBs holding held by nonresidents increased by

Rs. 39.8 billion due to the depreciation of the Sri

concessional debt of the total foreign debt stock

declined marginally to 47.7 per cent by end 2021

compared to 49.4 per cent reported by end 2020.

Foreign currency denominated outstanding debt, which stood at US dollars 38,492.7 million at end 2020 declined to US dollars 37,206.1 million by end 2021. Due to the parity variation caused by the depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee against debt denominated foreign currencies, the rupee value of foreign currency debt increased by around Rs. 500.2 billion at end 2021. The parity variation on the outstanding foreign project loans, FCTFF and ISBs amounted to Rs. 474.3 billion, while the same on the outstanding SLDBs and OBUs stood at Rs. 25.9 billion. If the debt denominated in foreign currency is serviced using foreign currency inflows to the Government, the impact of the nominal increase in the outstanding debt stock in rupee terms due to parity change would be less material. However, utilisation of a substantial amount of rupee funds to meet foreign currency debt servicing payments by the Government and financing the resultant increase in government borrowing requirements heavily through the banking sector, amidst the decline in foreign exchange inflows to the Government, remain concerns.

Central government debt of Sri Lanka elevated to disconcerting levels during the past two years, reflecting the impact of

while strengthening revenue mobilisation with a

credible and consistent commitment is of utmost

importance in order to record a surplus in the

primary balance in the medium term, thereby

ensuring sustainability of government debt.

Central Government Debt Service Payments

Total debt service payments increased by

22.4 per cent in nominal terms to Rs. 2,375.6

billion in 2021 with the rise in both debt

amortisation and interest payments. Domestic

debt repayments, i.e., domestic amortisation

payments, increased by 74.5 per cent to

Rs. 795.5 billion in 2021, mainly due to the

increase in maturing of Treasury bonds and

SLDBs. Foreign debt repayments increased by

5.3 per cent to Rs. 531.7 billion in 2021, primarily

reflecting the settlement of Rs. 199.9 billion (US

dollars 1 billion) worth of ISB maturities in July

2021 and the repayments in FCTFF amounting to

Rs. 330.6 billion during the year. Consequently,

total amortisation payments, which accounted for

55.9 per cent of total debt service payments,

increased by 38.1 per cent to Rs. 1,327.2 billion

in 2021 from Rs. 961.1 billion in the preceding

persistent fiscal deficits, restricted access to concessional financing and adverse implications driven by interest rate and exchange rate movements. Although foreign debt as a percentage of GDP marginally declined to 38.6 per cent in 2021 from 40.3 per cent in 2020, risks related to foreign debt servicing in the near term heightened due to the depletion of gross official reserves to low levels in the backdrop of the challenging domestic macroeconomic developments, uncertainties in the international capital markets triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as unfavourable sovereign credit rating downgrades. Unless augmented by foreign currency inflows under a creditable anchor, foreign currency debt service payments, which are falling due over US dollars 5 billion annually, on average, from 2022 onwards would be an extremely challenging task for Sri Lanka. Prudent fiscal policy measures and resource augmentation are required immediately, along with a reprofiling of debt portfolio. Meanwhile, the medium term policy priority should be to use debt financing mainly for the repayment of both domestic and foreign currency debt, without capitalising interest payments to avoid further accumulation of debt. Although foreign currency debt could be raised to meet near term foreign currency debt servicing obligations, further borrowings should be gradually reduced over the medium term, once non-debt creating inflows are in place, while aligning new financing requirements arising from overall fiscal deficit in line with resource availability. Given the heightened debt related vulnerabilities, the country needs sound liability management practices in line with the Medium Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS), with necessary revisions, to guide effective debt management operations towards debt stabilisation. Current efforts on debt restructuring are also critical to reduce the debt burden in the near term by smoothing the debt service payments over a longer period. In the meantime, reducing the deficit in the current account by streamlining recurrent expenditure

year. Meanwhile, interest payments on central

government debt increased by 6.9 per cent to

Rs. 1,048.4 billion in 2021 on account of increased

interest payments on domestic outstanding debt.

Interest payments on central government

domestic debt increased by 11.4 per cent to

Rs. 794.6 billion in 2021, due to the notable

increase in domestic borrowings during the year

compared to the previous year amidst limited

access to foreign financing and rise in domestic

interest rates, particularly towards the latter half

of 2021. With the reduction in interest payments on

ISBs, FCTFF and project loans, interest payments

on foreign debt decreased to Rs. 253.8 billion in

2021 in comparison to Rs. 266.7 billion recorded

in 2020. Overall, domestic debt service payments

increased by 36.0 per cent to Rs. 1,590.1 billion,

while foreign debt service payments marginally

increased by 1.8 per cent to Rs. 785.5 billion during

2021.

With the mounting debt stock and the

resultant high interest payments, the main

indicators related to debt service payments

elevated in 2021. Total debt service payments

increased to 14.1 per cent of GDP in 2021 from

12.9 per cent of GDP in the previous year.

Amortisation payments on domestic debt as a

percentage of GDP increased to 4.7 per cent in

2021 from 3.0 per cent in 2020, while amortisation

payments for foreign debt as a percentage of GDP

declined marginally to 3.2 per cent in 2021 from

3.4 per cent in 2020. However, total interest

payments as a percentage of GDP decreased to

6.2 per cent in 2021 from 6.5 per cent in 2020. Interest

payments on domestic debt as a percentage of GDP

remained broadly unchanged at 4.7 per cent in

2021, while interest payments on foreign debt

decreased to 1.5 per cent of GDP in 2021 from

1.8 per cent of GDP in the previous year. Meanwhile,

the ratio of central government debt service

payments to government revenue deteriorated

to 163.0 per cent in 2021 from 141.9 per cent in

2020, underscoring the gravity of the government

debt burden, as the total debt service payment of

the Government significantly exceeded government

Outstanding Public Debt

The outstanding public debt stock, which

includes outstanding central government

debt stock, foreign project loans received by

State-Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs),

and public guaranteed debt, increased notably

during 2021 largely due to the rise in central

government debt stock. As a percentage of

GDP, the outstanding public debt stock increased

to 115.5 per cent of GDP by end 2021 from

109.4 per cent of GDP recorded at end 2020.

In absolute terms, the outstanding public debt

witnessed a substantial increase of 18.1 per cent to

Rs. 19,407.3 billion by end 2021 from Rs. 16,427.1

billion reported at end 2020. The total outstanding

central government debt stock accounted for

90.6 per cent of the outstanding total public debt.

Meanwhile, in absolute terms, public guaranteed

debt witnessed an increase of 52.8 per cent

reaching Rs. 1,506.7 billion at end 2021 compared

to Rs.986.4 billion at end 2020 accounting for

7.8 per cent of total outstanding public debt. Of

the total outstanding public guaranteed debt,

62.1 per cent was denominated in foreign currency.

Moreover, the outstanding debt relating to foreign

project loans received by the SOBEs declined to

Rs. 311.2 billion at end 2021 from Rs. 323.5 billion

Since long, State Owned Enterprises (SOEs)1 have played a key role in the socioeconomic development of countries. Healthy SOEs have made significant contributions to employment creation, poverty alleviation, fiscal stability, development of a sector or geographical area, environmental protection and even sector regulation as witnessed in several countries, including Asian peers such as Singapore, Japan, China and Korea.

Although during recent decades there has been a growing consensus in favour of privatisation and deregulation, the role of SOEs has not diminished, especially in developing countries. This is primarily because SOEs continue to be the providers of essential infrastructure and public services which have the highest impact on economic growth, development and overall wellbeing of the population. However, SOEs in the developing world generally tend to be straddled by low productivity, while distorting competition and being afflicted by corruption. This has resulted in them being a significant burden on the budget and the government, and in some cases leading to fiscal and economic crises. It is essential that Sri Lanka remains wary of the performance of its own SOEs in this context.

Evolution of SOEs in Sri Lanka

The development of public sector enterprises in Sri Lanka dates back to the Second World War period of 1939 – 1945, when several SOEs were set up to provide essential goods whose supply had been curtailed during the war. In the mid 1950s, the interest in socialism piqued with the successes in the Soviet Union and the adoption of a socialist ideology of development in India during the same time. Accordingly, the Government of the time considered central planning as essential for the development of the country.

During this period, two key enactments catalysed the development process of SOEs, i.e. the Government Sponsored Corporations Act No. 19 of 1955 and the State Industrial Corporations Act No. 49 of 1957, respectively. The former sought to incorporate existing industrial undertakings, while the latter empowered the Government to set up and carry out any industrial activity. By 1957, several important SOEs had commenced operations, including those related to cement, paper, ceramics, leather and footwear. Another key development during this period was the nationalisation of bus companies leading to the formation of the Ceylon Transport Board in 1958.

BOX 7Restrategising State Owned Enterprises as Growth Facilitators

In 1959, a Ten Year Plan which emphasised import substituting industrialisation was introduced – although the plan was not entirely operational, it closely guided the economic policies of the following years. Accordingly, ‘basic industries’ such as cement, steel, paper, tyres, mineral sands, salt, flour milling, plywood, petroleum refining and fertiliser, were to be undertaken by the Government. However, some areas which were of interest to the Government were also open for private enterprise participation, such as footwear, ceramics, textiles and leather products. This inward oriented development strategy was warranted by the persistent deficits in the balance of payments and the resultant introduction of a series of stringent import controls from 1960 onwards.

The 1970s saw a fresh slew of measures towards autarky, including the setting up of several monopolies in the public sector through both establishment of new enterprises and a series of nationalisations and acquisition of private ventures. The creation of SOEs was expected to be beneficial as it was premised that, as natural monopolies, they would supply services or products at costs which were below than what potential private players could offer and that they would also be able to meet the demand of the entire market, perhaps also with export potential. Accordingly, in subsequent years, there was nationalisation of privately owned business undertakings such as those engaged in port services, passenger transport and plantations, among others. By the mid 1970s, major economic and social activities such as banking, plantations, large scale industries, transport, insurance, telecommunications, postal services, ports, electricity, import and distribution of petroleum, roads, health and education were either public sector monopolies or were largely undertaken by public enterprises. The numbers of SOEs rose rapidly from 14 in 1962 to over 280 public enterprises by the mid 1980s.

By the mid 1980s, it was noted that public enterprises were facing a multitude of issues. These included operational inefficiencies translating into poor financial performance, subpar quality of products and services and supply shortages, recruitments driven by political considerations rather than the needs of the SOEs, inability to mobilise resources to meet large investment requirements, and, excessive dependence on the government budget. The growing burden of SOEs on the budget alongside multilateral donor agencies highlighting the urgent need for macroeconomic stabilisation led to the Government announcing privatisation as a state policy in 1988. The divestiture programme commenced in 1989 and, over the period till 1993, partial or full divestitures of about 43 commercial enterprises were undertaken. However, this divestiture programme came under much criticism in the period thereafter. Many of Sri Lanka’s experiences with privatisation highlight that the weaker the economy and governing institutions, the more arduous it is to reap the benefits of privatisation.

1 There is no commonly accepted definition for an SOE (European Commission, 2013; IMF 2014; OECD 2015). However, some characteristics of SOEs are as follows: (1) the entity has its own, separate legal personality; (2) the entity is at least partially controlled by a government unit; and (3) the entity engages predominantly in commercial or economic activities (IMF, 2020). The Government Financial Statistics Manual 2014 (IMF, 2014) states that assessing government control of any entity involves judgment. Accordingly, a government may exercise significant influence over corporate decisions even when it owns a small number of shares.

Current Status of SOEs in Sri Lanka

Over the last three decades, successive governments have alternated between attempts at privatisation and nationalisation. Currently, there are over 400 SOEs operating in several key sectors including power, energy, finance and insurance, water, aviation, health and education, among others. While a large majority of SOEs are regulated by the ‘Administer Part II’ of the Finance Act No. 38 of 1971, of recent times, several have been established under the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007. Of these, 52 SOEs have been identified as State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs) as they are regarded to be strategically important to the functioning and transformation of the economy. SOBEs in Sri Lanka include the Bank of Ceylon, People’s Bank, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd, Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), Sri Lanka Ports Authority, SriLankan Airlines, Sri Lanka Transport Board and State Pharmaceuticals Corporation, among others.

Despite their pivotal role in the economy across strategic sectors, the poor financial performance of SOEs has become a heavy fiscal burden with significant macroeconomic implications. The excessive reliance of SOEs on the banking system to fund their losses has not only crowded out productive investments but has also rendered the financial system vulnerable to their weak financial performance. Macroeconomic stability is also threatened as their burgeoning financial losses weigh down on their ability to smoothly fulfill domestic demand for essential goods and services. Recognising the issue, in recent years, the Government undertook several initiatives to reform SOEs. Key reforms in this regard are the introduction of a Statement of Corporate Intent (SCI) as a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding signed by the respective enterprise, line Ministry and Ministry of Finance and the introduction of a regulatory framework for SOEs that provides commercial freedom, while increasing their level of accountability. Policy reforms have also been identified to amalgamate or consolidate SOEs with similar objectives and those at similar stages of the value chain thereby creating ‘economies of scale’ for these enterprises. Further, the Government also recently formed Selendiva Investments Ltd, a fully state owned company, to manage and consolidate several high end real estate assets in a bid to capitalise on the success of ‘holding company’ models, as seen in Singapore and Malaysia.

In the post COVID-19 recovery process of the economy, where an urgent correction of the course of the economy has become necessary, there is a dire need to expedite such reforms and further focus on the rigorous and rapid transformation of SOEs as growth facilitators. This is essential to improve their efficiency, productivity and profitability and thereby empower them to contribute to the economy’s recovery process in an effective and sustainable manner, without being a persistent economic issue. A few such key reforms that may be considered are discussed.

Proposed Major SOE Reforms

a. Introduction of Cost Reflective Pricing Policies

Often SOEs have to strike a fine balance between helping the Government achieve its socioeconomic objectives while ensuring the enterprise’s financial viability. This challenge stems from the engagement of SOEs in the provisioning of essential products and services, which are sometimes not commercially viable; for instance, the provision of public transport to rural communities or electricity in geographically challenging areas such as in mountainous regions. Despite this element of ‘essentiality’ associated with the portfolio of goods and services provided by Sri Lanka’s SOEs, establishing a cost reflective pricing mechanism is a key priority to ensure sustainable and uninterrupted provisioning of these goods and services.

In the recent past, Sri Lanka has struggled with the implementation of cost reflective pricing policies, especially in relation to the pricing of fuel products and utilities such as water and electricity. Despite a brief episode of frequent price adjustments of fuel products in line with global developments, no price revisions were undertaken between September 2019 and June 2021, after which three rounds of upward price revisions were undertaken to compensate for both the rising global prices of crude oil and the financial losses incurred by the CPC over several years. Tariffs for water and electricity continue to remain unrevised since 2012 and 2014, respectively. It must be reiterated that, in the case of enterprises such as the CPC and the CEB that rely on imported intermediate goods, their exposure to changes in global commodity prices as well as exchange rate fluctuations warrants regular price revisions. Hence, long periods of unchanged prices or tariffs are unacceptable as evidently losses on account of these external shocks cannot be absorbed by the relevant enterprises.

Accordingly, the implementation of transparent and depoliticised pricing rules are an urgent need. While subsidised prices may provide some financial benefits and leeway to consumers in the short term, it should be recognised that the related expenditure burden of below cost provisioning is borne by the Government. Subsidised prices cause price distortions and misallocation of resources that entail significant macroeconomic costs which could translate into insurmountable disruptions in the economy, as depicted by the power and energy crisis that emerged in early 2022. A cost reflective pricing mechanism will also ensure that SOEs pass on benefits of lower costs to consumers in a transparent and timely manner without negative implications on bottom line profits. Such a mechanism can greatly boost transparency and accountability of SOEs with positive spillover effects across the economy.

b. Improvement of Strategic Direction

The primary task of SOEs is not just to generate financial returns to the Government in the short term but also to deliver strategic value to all stakeholders of the economy by facilitating and uplifting their productive potential and overall wellbeing. Accordingly, it is imperative for

not only from domestic developments but also global developments. The poor strategic planning of SOEs is evident from the supply side shocks that the economy is experiencing in the wake of adverse developments in global energy and food commodity prices and the lack of any robust buffers to tide over such volatilities.

Therefore, to improve strategic direction, it is important for SOEs to minutely assess their operations. Breaking down the entire value chain of a product or service can enable enterprises to assess the areas in which they have natural advantages. Private sector participation can, therefore, be facilitated through such unbundling of activities. Accordingly, operational inefficiencies are borne neither by the Government nor consumers nor other relevant stakeholders.

c. Enhancement of Financial Transparency and Accountability

SOEs are often under pressure to be competitive and commercially viable, while trying to fulfil non-commercial objectives, the latter of which may necessitate compromising financial performance. In order to keep track of whether SOEs are effectively balancing their social obligations with their commercial obligations, it is important to establish a sound performance monitoring framework that incorporates principles of accountability, transparency and governance.

In this regard, one of the key aspects that is urgently needed is the identification and development of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure and evaluate results of SOEs. While such KPIs should assess financial results, it is also important to consider the impact on social, human and environmental capitals as SOEs have a wider purpose than simply being profit generators for the Government.

Another aspect that needs to be addressed is the improvement of disclosure and transparency of SOEs. Accordingly, SOEs must observe high standards and be subject to the same high quality accounting, disclosure, compliance, and auditing standards as listed companies. Time and again, concerns have been raised that numerous SOEs do not prepare year-end financial statements or annual progress reports in a timely manner; some entail delays of several years. A stringent mechanism is essential to ensure timely periodic reporting with disclosures of financial and nonfinancial information to assess the status of SOEs and whether they are performing in a financially viable and economically sustainable manner.

d. Strengthening Corporate Governance

The success of SOEs hinges on efficient and professional management by a competent Board. The Board needs to take full responsibility for stewardship and performance of the enterprise and should be competent enough to steer it in a strategic manner that is conducive to the vision of the Government and thereby, the progress of the economy. Inefficiencies on the part of the Board can result in a lack of strategic direction leading to the colossal mismanagement of state resources, as has been seen in the case of certain SOEs in Sri Lanka.

these entities to have a transparent and unambiguous strategy that is well connected to the overall vision of the Government. This will ensure a clear purpose and mission for SOEs.

As seen in the recent past, SOEs have been unable to leverage their resources to create value for stakeholders and catalyse growth. This has been evidenced by the lack of strategic planning causing bottlenecks in the economy wherein SOEs have often failed to proactively identify and address opportunities and challenges emanating,

The composition of Boards plays a crucial role in the quality of corporate governance. It is vital that the Government promotes the appointment of competent, experienced and professional individuals to Boards to ensure strong accountability. Appointments should be on the basis of fixed term contracts that are independent of election cycles. This can ensure efficacious strategic planning suited for transformation over the medium term rather than the implementation of transient fixes.

It is also essential that Boards and the senior management of SOEs act diligently and with extreme care considering that the resources entrusted to them are ultimately the resources of the general public. The recent issuance of Guidelines on Corporate Governance and an Operational Manual for State Owned Enterprises in late 2021 by the Ministry of Finance is a timely initiative in this regard. Rigorous monitoring on the part of the Ministry of Finance to ensure that all SOEs are operating in line with these guidelines can catalyse the transformation process of these entities. Regular reviews of the guidelines are also necessary to continuously align SOE corporate governance standards in line with best international practices.

Good corporate governance helps to operate SOEs more efficiently, improve access to capital, and mitigate risk while safeguarding against mismanagement. Research findings reveal several direct advantages for SOEs that have undergone governance reforms. Such benefits include improved operational performance, increased access to alternative sources of financing through domestic and international capital markets, financing for infrastructure development, reduced fiscal burden of SOEs and increased net contribution to the budget through higher dividend payments, and reduced corruption and improved transparency.

Reforms in SOEs: International Experiences

Countries across the world have made attempts across several decades to turnaround the performance of their SOEs. Selected SOE reform experiences, as could be pertinent to Sri Lanka, are described below.

Singapore

In the case of Singapore, the investment holding company Temasek has seen much success. It was established in 1974 to own and commercially manage investments and assets previously held by the Government of Singapore. Following independence in 1965, the lack of raw natural resources drove Singapore to commence an aggressive industrialisation and economic development programme. As the Government established startups in several strategic sectors, Temasek was established to relieve relevant ministries from the commercial management of these enterprises in which the Government had a controlling stake. With time, the fund encouraged portfolio companies to expand into other markets as well as to pursue mergers and acquisitions to become more internationally competitive. Revisions to the charter over several rounds led Temasek to evolve into a global investment company with the mission of generating sustainable returns beyond the present

generation. The portfolio value of Temasek stood at US dollars 283 billion as at end March 2021, having generated a group net profit of US dollars 42 billion during the same year. Notably, there are no government representatives on the Boards of portfolio companies under Temasek. Further, the Government of Singapore does not have any influence over the appointment of key personnel and operations of Temasek or other SOEs.

China

China’s SOEs have seen a series of reforms since the 1970s, driven by market oriented economic reforms aimed at opening up the economy to foreign trade. In 2003, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) was established to fund and regulate SOEs. From 2013 onwards, China focused on the merging of large SOEs and expanded mixed ownership programmes. Currently, China’s SOE reform agenda is focused on making SOEs ‘stronger, better and bigger’. Accordingly, SASAC’s zhuada fangxiao (grasp the big, release the small) approach seeks to reduce the number of small SOEs through privatisation and asset sales, while strengthening SOEs that are deemed to be strategically important for the state economy. It is opined that the companies held by SASAC have superior governance even in comparison to their private sector counterparts. Chief Executive Officers and Directors are appointed under performance based contracts with detailed dividend targets. Boards also comprise professional independent Directors to improve accountability.

Brazil

Despite grappling with underperforming SOEs, Brazil has created extremely successful SOEs such as Petrobras which is featured on the Fortune Global 500 list. In 2010, Petrobras was transformed from a purely state owned company into a mixed company. To date, the share democratisation that ensued this transformation is one of the largest capital-increase transactions in the history of capital markets. This created an increase in the market value of the company, while creating opportunities for the company to mobilise investments to support its growth. Listing of the company on the stock exchange also paved way for significantly improved corporate governance as the state’s participation as a sole proprietor was significantly curbed, thereby preventing the risk of political influence and lack of commitment by the board and management.

India

India has followed a strategy of disinvestment in recent years to address the issue of inefficient SOEs. This has entailed the sale of a substantial portion of the government shareholding of enterprises, including transfer of management control. Today, India has the second largest number of SOEs, after China, in the Fortune Global 500 list of companies. A recent move in its reform agenda has been the privatisation of Air India with the government of India receiving about US dollars 360 million in equity and a private conglomerate taking over US dollars 2 billion of debt. India is also to establish

a company, National Land Monetisation Corporation, to hold, manage and monetise surplus land and buildings of government agencies and public sector undertakings. This is to be set up as an entirely government owned company under the Ministry of Finance.

Successful SOE Turnaround in Sri Lanka:Case of Sri Lanka Telecom PLC

The telecommunications sector is one of the most successful service sectors in Sri Lanka, in terms of quality, reliability and pricing of services. Today, Sri Lanka boasts mobile penetration of over 135 per cent and has one of the lowest mobile and internet charges in the region. A key player in this industry is Sri Lanka Telecom PLC which has emerged as a successful SOE over the last two decades.

Following economic liberalisation, in the early 1980s Sri Lanka took a significant step in restructuring the telecommunications sector by instituting the Department of Telecommunications, which later handed over the operational functions to a public corporation, namely Sri Lanka Telecom. In 1996, Sri Lanka Telecom was reconstituted as a government owned Limited Liability Company. A turning point for the SOE was the sale of 25 per cent of the share capital to Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corporation for US dollars 225 million in the following year. This was followed by the successful listing of Sri Lanka Telecom PLC on the Colombo Stock Exchange in 2003. As at end 2020, the two major shareholders of Sri Lanka Telecom PLC were the Government, holding a 49.50 per cent stake through the Secretary to the Treasury and, Global Telecommunications Holdings N.V. with a 44.98 per cent stake and the remainder being held by other shareholders and publicly traded on the Colombo Stock Exchange. Accordingly, dividends from Sri Lanka Telecom stood at approximately Rs. 947 million in 2020 and dividends amounting to Rs. 1.4 billion are expected in 2022 and beyond.

The case of Sri Lanka Telecom highlights the innate potential that exists in SOEs and how the undertaking of timely reforms, such as through divestiture can help the economy harness this potential. It is also important to note that in this case, the setting up of the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka as an independent regulator facilitated the progress of Sri Lanka Telecom as it ensured the overall dynamic development of the sector through the creation of a regulatory environment that is committed towards ensuring competition and contestability.

Considering the success seen with Sri Lanka Telecom, going forward, the Government may consider the sale and/or divestiture of SOEs. In this regard, it is vital for successive governments to maintain a consistent policy stance in relation to the sale of government assets, while also addressing the concerns of stakeholders in a timely and proactive manner during such processes.

Way Forward

Going forward, as Sri Lanka progresses on its post COVID-19 recovery journey and transitions to the upper middle income status, it is crucial that the Government

expeditiously implements the reforms that are underway, especially in relation to mergers and consolidation and the strengthening of corporate governance, which have also been proposed above. Reforms relating to the implementation of a transparent pricing mechanism, improvement of strategic direction and enhancement of financial accountability are also imperative to improve the performance of SOEs in the short term. These not only ensure improved government revenue but also reduces the need for loss financing through budget transfers or as borrowings from the banking system. This can help release substantial volumes of resources to be channeled to more productive income generation or asset creation by households and enterprises. Accordingly, there will be a multiplier effect on government revenue in the short run and on growth in the medium to long run.

With due consideration to the key role that SOEs play in the economic development process, especially with their wide presence in strategic sectors, it is crucial that these enterprises perform effectively and deliver favourable socioeconomic outcomes without financially burdening the state. In this regard, the Government must conduct individual feasibility studies of SOEs and initiate timely action regarding the sale of some of their assets to domestic or foreign entities. Subsequently, the Government may also consider restrategizing these SOEs without politicizing them to ensure sustainable and viable operations. The Government must also recognise that although such reforms may require some unpopular policy initiatives at the outset, these can pave way for the creation of SOEs that are financially viable and economically beneficial over the medium to long run. The transformation of existing SOEs from ‘fiscal burdens’ and into ‘value creators,’ through such reforms, is vital for them to emerge as facilitators of Sri Lanka’s progress onto a high growth trajectory, rather than serve as stumbling blocks.

standards of the people.5 Accordingly, several

infrastructure related projects were implemented

during the year, including the Local Government

quality of health and education service delivery at

the sub national government level.

With the view to achieving a balanced

regional development and shared prosperity

in the country, the Finance Commission

(FC) recommended several measures to be

implemented in 2021, with funds allocated

from the National Budget, in the areas of

balanced regional development, inter-agency

coordination, devolved revenue generation,

and private sector participation. The FC

recommended allocating sufficient funds to

Provincial Councils (PCs) to accomplish their

expenditure needs including delivery of services in

terms of education and health at the sub national

level. Further, recommendations were made

to ensure the effective utilisation of resources

and to reduce regional disparities by disbursing

funds directly to PCs, preparing a consolidated

annual implementation plan for development

activities, and maintaining a balanced resource

allocation among PCs. As most of the disaster

response and mitigation activities and community

based interventions are channeled through PCs

and Local Authorities (LAs), the Commission

recommended allocating a special grant to PCs

under the National Budget for delivery of services

for LAs and for environment protection activities. In

line with this recommendation, the FC highlighted

the need to discontinue the allocations for other

ministries and departments on such activities.

Moreover, the FC recommended empowering PCs

and LAs with higher revenue generation in order

to reduce the dependency of PCs and LAs on the

central government budget. The FC recommended

establishing a common framework for planning,

budgeting, and reporting of public investments

in the national and sub national governments

to strengthen the intergovernmental financial

coordination. The recommendations were also

Budgetary Operations in Provincial Councils

Revenue collection of PCs improved in 2021,

reflecting the increased economic activities

during the year compared to 2020. Total revenue

of PCs increased to Rs. 58.1 billion in 2021 from

Rs. 52.2 billion in 2020 due to the increase in tax

revenue collection. Tax revenue increased to

Rs. 51.1 billion in 2021 from Rs. 43.1 billion in 2020

due to higher revenue collection from stamp duty,

which continued to be the key source of revenue

of PCs and increased to Rs. 38.8 billion in 2021

compared to Rs. 27.4 billion in 2020. However,

revenue earned from license fees declined to

Rs. 10.8 billion in 2021 in comparison to Rs.11.2

billion recorded in 2020, mainly due to the reduction

in motor vehicle registrations amidst the prevailing

import restrictions. With the removal of NBT in

December 2019, NBT revenue transferred from

the Central Government declined significantly

to Rs. 0.3 billion in 2021 compared to Rs. 2.7

billion recorded in 2020. Accordingly, the share of

revenue from stamp duty on tax revenue of PCs

increased to 76.0 per cent in 2021 from 63.5 per

cent in 2020, while the share of revenue from NBT

on tax revenue of PCs declined to 0.5 per cent

in 2021 from 6.3 per cent in 2020. Meanwhile,

non tax revenue declined to Rs. 7.1 billion in 2021

from Rs. 9.1 billion in 2020. Revenue in all other

provinces declined during 2021 in comparison to

the previous year, except the Western Province.

Accordingly, the share of revenue of the Western

Provincial Council out of the total revenue collection

by all PCs increased to 53.6 per cent in 2021 from

46.8 per cent in 2020 due to increased revenue

collection from stamp duty and interest income.

Among other PCs, the North Western and Southern

Provinces accounted for 10.3 per cent and 10.0 per

cent of the total revenue, respectively.

The total expenditure of PCs increased

mainly due to the rise in recurrent expenditure in

2021 compared to the preceding year. In nominal

terms, total expenditure increased to Rs. 376.4 billion

in 2021 from Rs. 337.0 billion in 2020, while as a

percentage of GDP, it broadly remained unchanged

at 2.2 per cent in 2021. Recurrent expenditure

increased to Rs. 317.0 billion in 2021 from Rs. 289.7

billion in 2020, mainly due to the rise in expenditure

on personal emoluments, which increased to

Rs. 251.5 billion in 2021 from Rs. 228.6 billion in

2020. Personal emoluments remained the largest

component of recurrent expenditure accounted for

about 79.4 per cent in the total recurrent expenditure

of PCs. Meanwhile, about 90 per cent of personal

emoluments of PCs were spent on the education and

health sectors. The Western, Central and Southern

PCs remained the highest spending authorities

accounting for 20.6 per cent, 12.8 per cent, and

12.5 per cent of total recurrent expenditure of PCs.

Meanwhile, capital expenditure of PCs increased to

Rs. 59.5 billion in 2021 from Rs. 47.3 billion in 2020,

mainly due to the rise in expenditure in relation to

special projects.

Despite the higher revenue collection of

PCs, transfers from the Central Government

to PCs increased significantly to meet higher

expenditure incurred by the PCs during the

year. Accordingly, transfers from the Central

Government to PCs increased by 11.8 per cent to

Rs. 318.3 billion in 2021, mainly due to the increase

in block grants and grants for special projects.

Transfers from the Central Government remained

at 1.9 per cent of GDP in 2021, unchanged from

2020. Block grants to PCs amounted to Rs. 284.6

billion during 2021, representing 89.4 per cent of

the total transfers. In addition, grants for special

projects increased to Rs. 18.5 billion in 2021 from

Rs. 6.4 billion in 2020. During 2021, the transfers

under the Province Specific Development

Grants and Criteria Based Grants amounted to

Rs. 12.6 billion and Rs. 2.6 billion, respectively.

At the same time, during the period under review,

about 84.6 per cent of expenditure of PCs was

financed through central government transfers

reflecting the necessity of building regional level

strategies that encourage revenue mobilisation

within PCs to reduce the pressure on the budget of

the Central Government. It may also be noted that the

continuation of an enlarged local and provincial

government system has been a significant financial

burden on the central government budget. It is

suggested that a strict governance code

to be implemented within the provincial

and local government system, ensuring

accountability and public scrutiny over their

finances.
