The parity variation on the outstanding foreign project loans, FCTFF and ISBs amounted to Rs. 474.3 billion, while the same on the outstanding SLDBs and OBUs stood at Rs. 25.9 billion. If the debt denominated in foreign currency is serviced using foreign currency inflows to the Government, the impact of the nominal increase in the outstanding debt stock in rupee terms due to parity change would be less material. However, utilisation of a substantial amount of rupee funds to meet foreign currency debt servicing payments by the Government and financing the resultant increase in government borrowing requirements heavily through the banking sector, amidst the decline in foreign exchange inflows to the Government, remain concerns.",

    "text": "persistent fiscal deficits, restricted access to concessional financing and adverse implications driven by interest rate and exchange rate movements. Although foreign debt as a percentage of GDP marginally declined to 38.6 per cent in 2021 from 40.3 per cent in 2020, risks related to foreign debt servicing in the near term heightened due to the depletion of gross official reserves to low levels in the backdrop of the challenging domestic macroeconomic developments, uncertainties in the international capital markets triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as unfavourable sovereign credit rating downgrades. Unless augmented by foreign currency inflows under a creditable anchor, foreign currency debt service payments, which are falling due over US dollars 5 billion annually, on average, from 2022 onwards would be an extremely challenging task for Sri Lanka. Prudent fiscal policy measures and resource augmentation are required immediately, along with a reprofiling of debt portfolio. Meanwhile, the medium term policy priority should be to use debt financing mainly for the repayment of both domestic and foreign currency debt, without capitalising interest payments to avoid further accumulation of debt. Although foreign currency debt could be raised to meet near term foreign currency debt servicing obligations, further borrowings should be gradually reduced over the medium term, once non-debt creating inflows are in place, while aligning new financing requirements arising from overall fiscal deficit in line with resource availability. Given the heightened debt related vulnerabilities, the country needs sound liability management practices in line with the Medium Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS), with necessary revisions, to guide effective debt management operations towards debt stabilisation. Current efforts on debt restructuring are also critical to reduce the debt burden in the near term by smoothing the debt service payments over a longer period. In the meantime, reducing the deficit in the current account by streamlining recurrent expenditure",

However, SOEs in the developing world generally tend to be straddled by low productivity, while distorting competition and being afflicted by corruption.

The creation of SOEs was expected to be beneficial as it was premised that, as natural monopolies, they would supply services or products at costs which were below than what potential private players could offer and that they would also be able to meet the demand of the entire market, perhaps also with export potential. Accordingly, in subsequent years, there was nationalisation of privately owned business undertakings such as those engaged in port services, passenger transport and plantations, among others. By the mid 1970s, major economic and social activities such as banking, plantations, large scale industries, transport, insurance, telecommunications, postal services, ports, electricity, import and distribution of petroleum, roads, health and education were either public sector monopolies or were largely undertaken by public enterprises. The numbers of SOEs rose rapidly from 14 in 1962 to over 280 public enterprises by the mid 1980s.",

These included operational inefficiencies translating into poor financial performance, subpar quality of products and services and supply shortages, recruitments driven by political considerations rather than the needs of the SOEs, inability to mobilise resources to meet large investment requirements, and, excessive dependence on the government budget. The growing burden of SOEs on the budget alongside multilateral donor agencies highlighting the urgent need for macroeconomic stabilisation led to the Government announcing privatisation as a state policy in 1988. The divestiture programme commenced in 1989 and, over the period till 1993, partial or full divestitures of about 43 commercial enterprises were undertaken. However, this divestiture programme came under much criticism in the period thereafter. Many of Sri Lanka\u2019s experiences with privatisation highlight that the weaker the economy and governing institutions, the more arduous it is to reap the benefits of privatisation.",

While a large majority of SOEs are regulated by the \u2018Administer Part II\u2019 of the Finance Act No. 38 of 1971, of recent times, several have been established under the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007.

The excessive reliance of SOEs on the banking system to fund their losses has not only crowded out productive investments but has also rendered the financial system vulnerable to their weak financial performance. Macroeconomic stability is also threatened as their burgeoning financial losses weigh down on their ability to smoothly fulfill domestic demand for essential goods and services. Recognising the issue, in recent years, the Government undertook several initiatives to reform SOEs. Key reforms in this regard are the introduction of a Statement of Corporate Intent (SCI) as a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding signed by the respective enterprise, line Ministry and Ministry of Finance and the introduction of a regulatory framework for SOEs that provides commercial freedom, while increasing their level of accountability. Policy reforms have also been identified to amalgamate or consolidate SOEs with similar objectives and those at similar stages of the value chain thereby creating \u2018economies of scale\u2019 for these enterprises. Further, the Government also recently formed Selendiva Investments Ltd, a fully state owned company, to manage and consolidate several high end real estate assets in a bid to capitalise on the success of \u2018holding company\u2019 models, as seen in Singapore and Malaysia.",

This challenge stems from the engagement of SOEs in the provisioning of essential products and services, which are sometimes not commercially viable; for instance, the provision of public transport to rural communities or electricity in geographically challenging areas such as in mountainous regions. Despite this element of \u2018essentiality\u2019 associated with the portfolio of goods and services provided by Sri Lanka\u2019s SOEs, establishing a cost reflective pricing mechanism is a key priority to ensure sustainable and uninterrupted provisioning of these goods and services.",

    "text": "In the recent past, Sri Lanka has struggled with the implementation of cost reflective pricing policies, especially in relation to the pricing of fuel products and utilities such as water and electricity. Despite a brief episode of frequent price adjustments of fuel products in line with global developments, no price revisions were undertaken between September 2019 and June 2021, after which three rounds of upward price revisions were undertaken to compensate for both the rising global prices of crude oil and the financial losses incurred by the CPC over several years. Tariffs for water and electricity continue to remain unrevised since 2012 and 2014, respectively. It must be reiterated that, in the case of enterprises such as the CPC and the CEB that rely on imported intermediate goods, their exposure to changes in global commodity prices as well as exchange rate fluctuations warrants regular price revisions. Hence, long periods of unchanged prices or tariffs are unacceptable as evidently losses on account of these external shocks cannot be absorbed by the relevant enterprises.",

    "text": "Accordingly, the implementation of transparent and depoliticised pricing rules are an urgent need. While subsidised prices may provide some financial benefits and leeway to consumers in the short term, it should be recognised that the related expenditure burden of below cost provisioning is borne by the Government. Subsidised prices cause price distortions and misallocation of resources that entail significant macroeconomic costs which could translate into insurmountable disruptions in the economy, as depicted by the power and energy crisis that emerged in early 2022. A cost reflective pricing mechanism will also ensure that SOEs pass on benefits of lower costs to consumers in a transparent and timely manner without negative implications on bottom line profits. Such a mechanism can greatly boost transparency and accountability of SOEs with positive spillover effects across the economy.",

As the Government established startups in several strategic sectors, Temasek was established to relieve relevant ministries from the commercial management of these enterprises in which the Government had a controlling stake. With time, the fund encouraged portfolio companies to expand into other markets as well as to pursue mergers and acquisitions to become more internationally competitive. Revisions to the charter over several rounds led Temasek to evolve into a global investment company with the mission of generating sustainable returns beyond the present",

In 1996, Sri Lanka Telecom was reconstituted as a government owned Limited Liability Company. A turning point for the SOE was the sale of 25 per cent of the share capital to Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corporation for US dollars 225 million in the following year. This was followed by the successful listing of Sri Lanka Telecom PLC on the Colombo Stock Exchange in 2003. As at end 2020, the two major shareholders of Sri Lanka Telecom PLC were the Government, holding a 49.50 per cent stake through the Secretary to the Treasury and, Global Telecommunications Holdings N.V. with a 44.98 per cent stake and the remainder being held by other shareholders and publicly traded on the Colombo Stock Exchange. Accordingly, dividends from Sri Lanka Telecom stood at approximately Rs. 947 million in 2020 and dividends amounting to Rs. 1.4 billion are expected in 2022 and beyond.",

Subsequently, the Government may also consider restrategizing these SOEs without politicizing them to ensure sustainable and viable operations.
