    "text": "Tourism is defined as \u201ca social, cultural and economic phenomenon which entails the movement of people to countries or places outside their usual environment for personal or business/professional purposes\u201d by the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO). International Tourism (hereinafter referred to as \u201cTourism\u201d) is basically exportation of services. Tourism earnings and expenditure are recorded as \u201cTravel\u201d under \u201cServices\u201d in the Goods and Services Account of the Balance of Payment (Balance of Payment and International Investment Position Manual - BPM 6 of the International Monetary Fund). Tourism remains an important source of net foreign currency earnings for a country, as the foreign currency outflows on account of inputs are minimal. In addition to earning foreign currency, the tourism industry also contributes to economic growth, employment, and reduction in regional income disparity. Sri Lanka\u2019s strategic location, attractive natural endowments, cultural diversity, and rich history, together with the peaceful, clean, safe and foreigner-friendly environment, provide the basis for this industry to flourish. Therefore, development of the tourism industry will be a key economic priority, particularly in the post-pandemic economic recovery period, to mitigate external sector imbalances in the country.",

    "text": "Tourism remained the third largest source of foreign currency earnings between 2014 and 2019 and contributed to about 14 per cent of total foreign currency earnings during this period. Although export earnings, which is the largest source of foreign currency earnings, grew from US dollars 8,626 million in 2010 to US dollars 12,499 million in 2021, generation of earnings through such exports needed a considerable amount of import expenditure on account of inputs. However, tourism as a single industry has been able to generate substantial earnings with a relatively low reliance on imports of inputs. For instance, in the peak year of tourism in Sri Lanka, i.e., 2018, earnings from tourism, estimated at US dollars 4,381 million, outnumbered net export earnings of the apparel industry, that is, export earnings net of import expenditure on textiles (US dollars 2,459 million), and export earnings by other key industries such as tea (US dollars 1,428 million) and rubber products (US dollars 875 million). Meanwhile, workers\u2019 remittances, which have been the second largest source of foreign currency earnings, brought an average of US dollars 7,023 million per annum between 2014 and 2019 despite falling to US dollars 5,491 million in 2021. Therefore, tourism is an important source of foreign currency earnings to Sri Lanka and has a key role to play in maintaining the country\u2019s resilience to external sector pressures.",

    "text": "The global tourism industry recorded a steady growth in the recent decades despite setbacks suffered from time to time due to occurrences such as the global financial crisis and outbreaks of epidemics. Tourist arrivals reached 1,468 million by 2019 according to UNWTO. Sri Lanka too saw a continuous increase in tourism arrivals in the past until 2018, with a substantial increase from 2010 when the civil war ended. In fact, in 2018, Sri Lanka was named the top destination for the year 2019 by the acclaimed tourism information provider \u201cLonely Planet.\u201d However, unfortunately, tourism arrivals in 2019 saw a set back because of the terrorist attacks on Easter Sunday in April 2019, though global tourist arrivals reached the record highest in that year. Despite this setback, tourist arrivals and earnings showed a recovery by end of 2019 and early 2020, before starting to decline again because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile the global tourism industry is expected to record a slow recovery in the forthcoming years. According to a survey conducted by UNWTO in January 2022 among its panel of tourism experts, 63 per cent of respondents expected that international tourist arrivals in their countries will not recover to the 2019 level until 2024, while 79 per cent of the respondents believed that arrivals in the Asia Pacific region will not recover to 2019 levels until 2024. However, UNWTO, World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) and market analysts have shown that there is substantial pent-up savings and a yearning to travel among potential travellers, while tourism characteristics have fundamentally changed because of the pandemic. Therefore, there is a potential for Sri Lanka to attract a substantial number of tourists and/or generate substantial foreign currency earnings from tourism even in 2022 and 2023, if appropriate strategies are implemented efficiently and effectively.",

Meanwhile, rules were issued by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in January 2022 requiring hotel service providers to accept payments from non-residents only in foreign currency, which will ensure the inflow of foreign currency to the country on account of tourism. This also allows the tourism sector to strengthen its earnings in foreign currency without major capital investments, as the sector has made heavy investments in local and foreign currency. Meanwhile, some small-scale hotels kept afloat by renting hotels as quarantine centres when the industry as a whole suffered a significant setback due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

For example, travellers are skeptic of booking well in advance owing to the sudden changes in restrictions imposed by countries and risks from testing positive for COVID-19. Further, travellers prefer accommodation and transport options that allow sudden cancellations without a penalty. Secondly, due to the normalisation of remote working through the pandemic, concepts such as \u201cdigital nomads\u201d and \u201cstaycations\u201d have become popular, and travellers seek long duration visa, long duration discounts at places of accommodation, fast internet, and other work-related facilities. International tourism organisations further note that the length of stay and spending on a trip increased in 2021. Thirdly, the profile of travellers has changed with more younger travellers (in their 20s to 40s) opting to travel, rather than older persons or families with small children due to health concerns. Therefore, the tourism industry and the country as a whole should be able to accommodate the needs and preferences of such tourists. This age group values adventure and individualism and they use mobile phones and digital services to plan and book their trips and rely on social media, blogs and online reviews of other travellers. Fourthly, appreciation of the value of mental health and personal wellness has increased notably in the recent past and consumer interest in achieving these needs through travelling has also increased. There is also an interest for \u201cphilantourism\u201d where tourists can get involved in philanthropical activities and \u201cecotourism\u201d to gain knowledge about ecological centres around the world. Fifth, the tendency to go on secondary trips, exploring lesser-known attractions near places of main tourism interests and rural tourism has also increased.",

Further, noise pollution near attractions and places of accommodation should be managed. Supervising practices that tourism service providers are engaged in are environmentally friendly (for example, whale watching tours disturbing whales) is also important.

Given the intense competition among countries to attract tourists and the evolving nature of tourist characteristics, use of a strong information network for policy decisions is pivotal. The \u201cTourism Satellite Accounting\u201d initiative that the Department of Census and Statistics is implementing with the support of UNWTO will enable better estimation of the economic contribution of tourism to National Accounts. Hence, its implementation needs to be fast tracked. In addition, high frequency data on a multitude of other aspects is necessary, such as characteristics of persons arriving under tourist visas, how much they are spending and for what and where, satisfaction level, employment in tourism, number and types of direct and indirect tourism service providers and various spatial information. The need for national tourism authorities to enhance their market research capabilities to improve the customer journey, trigger innovation and offer insights to the private sector has been highlighted in multi-country studies conducted during the pandemic by the International Monetary Fund as well.

Incidentally, over-reliance on tourism is a feature of countries that have been less successful in other exports and are suffering from such features. Such tourism-dependent countries have a relatively low level of export complexity that affects their options for new product development. Development of new products requires the expansion of the productive knowledge and capacities. Tourism is not an industry that enhances the technological capacity of a country and is highly vulnerable to external shocks. In the aforementioned publication, the IMF shows the prudence of tourism-dependent countries (which includes Sri Lanka) to nurture other goods and services export sectors using new digital economy tools or focus on overall export development. As suggested in this report, in the medium-term, Sri Lanka should re-think its tourism model and undertake necessary structural reforms.",
