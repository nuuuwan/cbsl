which is the largest source of foreign currency earnings, 
grew from US dollars 8,626 million in 2010 to US dollars 
12,499 million in 2021, generation of earnings through 
such exports needed a considerable amount of import 
expenditure on account of inputs. However, tourism as 
a single industry has been able to generate substantial 
earnings  with  a  relatively  low  reliance  on  imports  of 
inputs. For instance, in the peak year of tourism in Sri 
Lanka,  i.e.,  2018,  earnings  from  tourism,  estimated 
at  US  dollars  4,381  million,  outnumbered  net  export 
earnings of the apparel industry, that is, export earnings 
net of import expenditure on textiles (US dollars 2,459 
million),  and  export  earnings  by  other  key  industries 
such  as 
tea 
(US  dollars  1,428  million)  and  rubber 
products (US dollars 875 million). Meanwhile, workers’ 
remittances, which have been the second largest source 
of  foreign  currency  earnings,  brought  an  average  of 
US  dollars  7,023  million  per  annum  between  2014 
and  2019  despite  falling  to  US  dollars  5,491  million 
in  2021.  Therefore,  tourism  is  an  important  source  of 
foreign  currency  earnings  to  Sri  Lanka  and  has  a  key 
role  to  play  in  maintaining  the  country’s  resilience  to 
external sector pressures.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
