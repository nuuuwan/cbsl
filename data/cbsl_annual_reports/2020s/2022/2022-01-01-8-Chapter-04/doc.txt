4.1 OverviewT

he general price level as measured by the official consumer price indices followed an overall

increasing trend during 2021 with a notable rise in the latter part of the year. Global commodity price

hikes of both food and non-food items, higher freight charges, domestic supply side bottlenecks,

direct and indirect impacts from various price revisions and demand pressure instigated by successful control

of the COVID-19 pandemic made a considerable impact on domestic prices. Within the Food category,

a major contribution to the increase in the general price level was from the prices of items in the Volatile

Food category. Furthermore, prices of items in the Volatile Food category increased noticeably in the latter

part of 2021, mainly due to harvest reduction that arose with the shifting to organic farming practices and

higher festive demand due to normalisation of economic activities with the control of the pandemic. Further,

prices of food items excluding Volatile Food increased continuously during 2021. Prices of items in the

Non-Food category increased continuously during the period at a higher pace towards the end of the year,

yet generated a lesser impact on the general price level, compared to the Food category. Reflecting these

developments, the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI, 2013=100) followed an overall increasing trend

from 138.7 index points in January 2021 to 154.7 index points in December 2021, and the National Consumer

Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100), which recorded 142.1 index points in January 2021 increased to 161.0 index

points by December 2021. In terms of wages, nominal and real wages of both formal and informal private

sector increased in 2021 compared to 2020. Formal private sector wages increased with revisions made to

the minimum wages while the increase in informal private sector wages was attributed to higher demand

for labour with the normalisation of economic activities due to easing of COVID-19 related travel restrictions

and rise in cost of living. With regard to the public sector, the nominal wage rate index remained unchanged

during 2020 and 2021, while the real wage rate index decreased in 2021 compared to 2020.

4.2 Prices

Movements in the General Price Level

The general price level, as measured by both

Consumer Price Indices (CPIs), namely, the

CCPI and NCPI,1 moved in an overall increasing

trend during 2021, mostly attributable to

the increases in prices of items in the Food

category. During the year, prices of items in the

Food category demonstrated an overall increasing

trend. Meanwhile, prices of the items in the

Non-Food category, which generated a lesser

impact on the general price level compared to the Food

category also exhibited an overall increasing trend.

Accordingly, the general price level demonstrated a

continuous increase during 2021 except for March,

during which the Food category recorded a decline

owing to the favourable supply in the Maha season.

Moreover, global commodity price hikes, high

freight charges, production shortages, and logistical

bottlenecks made a considerable impact on the

general price level, including the indirect impacts

from various upward price revisions in items of both

Food and Non-Food categories, forcing the general

price level to increase at a considerable pace

towards the end of the year. The increased money

incomes of the people due to deficit financing by the

banking sector have also contributed to raise prices

of limited supply of goods and services. Moreover,

COVID-19 related subdued demand tapered off by

the end of the year and demand pressure impacted

on the general price level.

Prices of items in the Volatile Food2 category

increased during 2021 with a significant rise

during the last two months of the year. Moreover,

1 The Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), compiles official consumer price indices, namely, the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100) and the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI, 2013=100) on a monthly basis. The NCPI demonstrates the price movements of selected consumer items at the national level, while the CCPI reflects the same among urban households in the Colombo district.

2 Volatile Food includes rice, meat, fresh fish and seafood, coconut, fresh fruits, vegetables, potato, onions and selected condiments.

issues associated with attempts towards fully

shifting to organic farming practices such as limited

availability of organic fertiliser, absence of proper

guidance and instructions on organic farming,

higher prices of existing chemical fertiliser stocks,

destruction of cultivation and lower yield made a

significant upward pressure on prices of Volatile

Food items. In January and February 2021, prices

of volatile food items increased mainly due to

price increases observed in rice, coconut, green

chilli and vegetables. However, prices of items in

the Volatile Food category declined in March and

April 2021 owing to declines observed in the prices

of coconut, vegetables, onions, green chilli, and

potatoes. The observed downward trend saw a

reversal thereafter, with a noticeable increase in

June 2021, contributed by the price rises observed

in rice, vegetables and fresh fish, while continuing

the same trend in July 2021. The direction of the

Volatile Food category changed in August 2021

owing to the price decreases observed in rice,

coconut, and onions, while the price declines seen

in rice and vegetables mainly contributed to the

decline recorded in September 2021. Afterwards,

the increase observed in October 2021 was

attributable to price increases in rice, fruits, big

onion, and chicken. Further, increases recorded in

the Volatile Food category intensified in November

and December 2021, driven by price increases in

rice, vegetables, green chilli, chicken, fish, coconut,

potato, and onions along with higher consumer

demand due to the festive season. Rice prices

increased continuously during the period up to

July 2021, which included the months during which

the 2020/2021 Maha harvest reached the market.

However, in response to several measures taken

by the Government, rice prices declined in August

and September 2021. Furthermore, Maximum Retail

Prices (MRPs) of Samba, Nadu, Kekulu White, and

Kekulu Red, which remained unchanged for more

than a year, were revised upwards in September

2021, this gazette notification on MRPs was

rescinded in the same month in order to prevent a

rice shortage in the market. Meanwhile, the Special

Commodity Levy (SCL) on imported rice was revised

downwards at the beginning of November 2021 in

order to balance supply side issues. It was however

observed that prices of all local rice varieties rose at

a rapid pace with the removal of respective MRPs

in September 2021, further contributed by higher

festive demand during November and December

2021, especially due to normalisation of economic

activities with the successful control of the spread

of COVID-19. Vegetable prices demonstrated

mixed movements with the supply disruptions

instigated by travel restrictions imposed due to

the COVID-19 pandemic, limited trading activities

in major economic centers and adverse weather

conditions being the major influences, while the

prices escalated towards the last two months of the

year mainly owing to supply shortages instigated by

scarcities in fertilisers and pesticides and the high

festive demand. Coconut prices recorded an overall

decrease during 2021 allowing the Government

to rescind the gazette notification on MRP with

effect from 18 June 2021. However, coconut prices

exhibited an increasing trend during October to

December 2021, due to seasonal factors, higher

consumption during festive season and lower

coconut availability for domestic consumption due to

increased external demand for desiccated coconut.

The price of chicken increased considerably during

the year mainly due to rising cost of production that

resulted from elevated prices of poultry feed, such

as maize and antibiotics. Meanwhile, prices of

both large and small fish varieties increased during

2021. Further, prices of potatoes, of which the SCL

underwent several revisions, remained mostly at

stable levels during the first nine months of 2021

with a notable increase afterwards. Prices of red

onion demonstrated an overall decline during the

period, while prices of big onion mostly steadied

during the year owing to timely interventions made

by the Government, yet demonstrated a continuous

increasing trend towards the latter part of the year.

Meanwhile, gazette notifications that were issued

imposing price controls on imported potato and big

onion in the Volatile Food category were rescinded

with effect from 03 November 2021 with a view of

preventing essential food shortage in the market.

Prices of food items excluding Volatile

Food increased continuously during 2021.

Accordingly, dhal prices increased continuously

during the year remaining above the prices

observed in 2020, mainly due to price increases

in the global market and higher freight charges.

Sugar prices which increased in April 2021 due to

festive demand, increased thereafter with a peak

in August 2021 as a result of the acquisition of

Import Control License (ICL) to import sugar being

mandatory. Though the Government’s decision

was based on the knowledge that sufficient sugar

stocks were already available in the country,

private traders issued only a limited stocks to the

local market causing an upward price pressure.

Moreover, global sugar prices remained higher

in 2021 compared to 2020 due to drop in sugar

production and higher global demand. As a result,

MRPs were imposed on white sugar with effect

from 02 September 2021, with the view of reducing

sugar prices. However, MRPs imposed on sugar

were removed with effect from 03 November 2021,

as sugar prices followed an increasing trend from

mid-September 2021 onwards. Global milk powder

prices increased with the limited production caused

by unfavorable weather conditions in Australia and

New Zealand and increased global demand with

the normalisation of economic activities along with

gradual easing of COVID-19 related restrictions.

Consequently, the price of imported milk powder,

which remained unchanged throughout 2020,

experienced an upward price revision in October

2021 due to price increases in the global market,

higher freight charges and removal of price

controls. A subsequent price increase in local

milk powder also occurred with effect from

15 October 2021. Afterwards, imported milk

powder underwent another upward price revision

towards the end of 2021. Meanwhile, a gazette

notification was issued to maintain the SCL of

Rs. 100 per kg on dried fish with effect from

12 August 2021 to encourage local dried

fish producers. Moreover, wheat flour price

also underwent an upward price revision of

Rs. 10 per kg with effect from 10 October 2021,

resulting in an increase of Rs. 5 per 450g loaf of

bread with effect from 11 October 2021, in addition

to increases in prices of other bakery products

such as buns and cakes. Further, another upward

price revision was made on wheat flour causing a

consequent upward revision in 450g loaf of bread

by Rs. 10 with effect from 29 November 2021.

Later, it was announced that the price controls

imposed on all bakery products including bread

were removed with effect from 21 December 2021

with the intention of allowing their prices to be

determined by the respective input cost and other

market conditions. It is noteworthy that gazette

notifications that were issued imposing price

controls on several essential commodity items,

namely, white sugar, dhal, chicken, canned fish,

wheat flour, green gram, gram, dried fish, maize,

and imported milk powder were rescinded with

effect from 03 November 2021.

Prices of items in the Non-Food category

increased continuously during 2021 at a

higher pace towards the end of the year, albeit

generating a lesser impact on the general

price level compared to the Food category.

COVID-19 vaccination rates, relaxing pandemic

related restrictions and normalisation of economic

activities. This was reflected in the import price of

crude oil,3 which increased by 64.6% in December

2021 compared to December 2020. As a result,

domestic prices of petrol (92 octane), auto diesel,

and kerosene were increased twice in 2021

causing additional indirect price pressure on the

general price level. In addition, prices of vehicle

spare parts, vehicle servicing costs and taxi

fares increased during the year. Further, prices

of some prepared food items in the Restaurants

and Hotels subcategory recorded increases on

several occasions in 2021. This was partially

caused by the significant upward price revision in

a Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinder weighing

12.5kg with effect from 10 October 2021 by both

Litro Gas Lanka Ltd and Laugfs Gas PLC due

to rising global LPG prices. It is noteworthy that

LPG prices,4 i.e., Propane and Butane, increased

by 76.6% and 63.0% in December 2021,

respectively, in the global market, compared to

December 2020. In addition to revisions to LPG

prices, increased food prices also played a major

role in upward adjustments in domestic prices of

prepared food. The Education subcategory, which

remained at constant levels mostly during the

year, increased from September 2021 onwards

due to increases observed in international school

fees and tuition fees for secondary education.

Prices of private medical practices, payments

to private hospitals/medical laboratories and

medical/pharmacy products exhibited intermittent

revisions resulting in continuous increases in the

Health subcategory from April onwards. However,

the increase observed in housing rent in October

2021 was marginal compared to the observed

Non-Food categories contributed towards the

notable monthly increases observed during the

period from October to December 2021, with

a substantial share originating from the Food

category.

National Consumer Price Index

The NCPI, which recorded 142.1 index

points in January 2021, increased continuously

to 161.0 index points in December 2021,

except in March 2021, which recorded a

monthly decline. Movements in prices of the

Food category mainly contributed towards the

increase observed in the NCPI in January and

February 2021. This increasing trend reversed in

March 2021 solely due to price decreases of items

in the Food category. However, from April, when the

third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic surfaced, the

NCPI increased until December 2021 as a result of

the increases observed in prices of items in both

Food and Non-Food categories; yet the considerable

contributions were from the Food category except

for September and October 2021, with the major

influencer being the Non-Food category. While

supply shortages of food items raised their prices,

the increased money incomes of certain sectors of

the population also contributed to further increases

of those prices.

maintenance and equipment increased noticeably

from September 2021 onwards. Meanwhile,

prices of clothing and footwear, which remained

mostly at constant levels during 2020 increased

continuously in 2021 at a higher rate from October

onwards.

Consumer Price Indices

Colombo Consumer Price Index

The CCPI accelerated from 138.7 index

points in January 2021 to 154.7 index points

in December 2021. Monthly increases observed

in January and February 2021 were supported

by the movement of prices of items in both Food

and Non-Food categories. However, monthly

declines observed in the CCPI during March and

April 2021 were solely driven by the movement

of prices of the Food category. Afterwards, the

movement of prices of items in both Food and

Non-Food categories contributed towards the

increases observed in May and June 2021 with

a higher contribution from the Food category.

The increase in the CCPI observed in July 2021

was entirely caused by the movement of

prices of items in the Non-Food category, yet

the increases observed in both August and

September 2021 were driven by the prices of

items in both Food and Non-Food categories.

PRICES AND WAGES

139

Producer's Price Index (PPI)

The PPI as measured by the average prices

received by domestic producers of goods and

services in Agriculture, Manufacturing, and

Utilities sectors was rebased to 2018 Q4 from

2013 Q4 in November 2021 by its compiler,

the Department of Census and Statistics.

Accordingly, the weights and prices in the

rebased PPI were updated to reflect the current

economic trends. Further, several new items

were added, and some items were removed from

both Agriculture and Manufacturing sub-sectors,

in addition to expanding the geographical

coverage of the Manufacturing sub-sector.

The PPI (2018 Q4=100) exhibited an overall

increasing trend during 2021 from 116.0 index

points in January to 133.7 index points in December

2021. The PPI in the Agriculture sub-sector

recorded 134.0 index points in January 2021,

remained at comparatively stable levels and

increased continuously in the last five months of

the year, reaching 161.7 index points in December

2021. Meanwhile, the PPI in the Manufacturing

sub-sector reported 113.9 index points and 131.4

index points in January and December 2021,

respectively, recording monthly increases mostly

during the year. The PPI in the Utility (Electricity,

Gas, Steam and Air conditioning supply and Water

collection, treatment and supply) sub-sector, which

recorded 100.1 index points in January 2021,

recorded notable fluctuations during the first four

months and steadied afterwards throughout the

year reaching 102.5 index points in December

2021.

4.3 Wages

Real wages of employees in the formal

and informal private sectors showed

increases while the real wages of public

sector employees showed an erosion in

2021 compared to the previous year. Nominal

wages also showed an increase in terms of

employees in the private sector while it remained

unchanged for the employees in the public sector

during 2021 compared to the previous year. The

repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, such

as travel restrictions and contraction in economic

activities, negatively impacted the growth of

wages in 2021. On the other hand, normalisation

of economic activities with the successful

roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccination programme

and the decision to increase the minimum wages

of employees in the formal private sector had a

positive impact especially on formal and informal

private sector wages.

Private Sector Wages

Nominal wages of informal private sector

employees, as measured by the informal private

sector wage rate index (2012=100), followed

an overall increasing trend during 2021. The

nominal wage rate index recorded moderate

increases during 2021 except a slight decline in

April 2021 and sharp spikes recorded in both

September and October 2021. The decline in

April was due to the decrease observed in wages

of small industry activities whereas, the sharp

increases observed in September and October 2021

were driven by all sub-activities: agriculture,

industry, and services. With these developments,

the nominal wage rate index of the informal private

sector increased by 9.2% in 2021 compared to

2020. Meanwhile, nominal wages of agriculture

increased by 6.4%, industry increased by 9.7%, and

services increased by 10.0% in 2021 compared to

2020. Normalisation of economic activities with the

ease of COVID-19 related travel restrictions and the

nationwide vaccination programme paved the way

for the increase in informal sector wages. Moreover,

the increase in labour demand caused by the shift

140

of labour between industries as reflected by the

employment numbers, also caused some increases

in respective wages. Moreover, the rise in cost of

living also contributed to the increase in informal

sector wages, especially towards the latter part of

the year. Meanwhile, the real wage rate index of the

informal private sector increased by 2.0% in 2021

compared to 2020.

Nominal wages of employees in the formal

private sector,5 as measured by the minimum

wage rate index (1978 December=100) of

employees, whose wages are governed by

wage boards, increased significantly by 74.4%

in 2021 compared to 2020. This significant

increase was caused by the increase in the daily

wage of tea and rubber plantation workers to

Rs. 1,000 with effect from 05 March 2021, through

respective wage boards for the tea and rubber

growing and manufacturing trade. Further, the

increase in the minimum monthly salary of the

private sector from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 12,500

and in the minimum daily wage from Rs. 400 to

Rs. 500, due to the amendment made to the

National Minimum Wage of Workers Act, No. 03

of 2016 with effect from 16 August 2021 also

contributed to this increase. Accordingly, the real

wage rate index of the formal private sector also

increased significantly by 64.3% in 2021 compared

to the previous year. Meanwhile, the tripartite

agreement on paying 50% of the last paid basic

salary or Rs. 14,500 per month, whichever was more

favourable to the employee, in situations where

employees were required to stay at home due to the

COVID-19 pandemic, was extended until December

2021 for the tourism sector.

Public Sector Wages

Nominal wages of public sector employees,

as measured by the public sector wage rate

index (2016=100), remained unchanged during

2021 compared to the previous year. On the

other hand, public sector employees experienced

a real wage erosion of 6.4% during 2021

compared to 2020. The upward revisions made to

the salary scales of Sri Lanka Principals’ Service,

Sri Lanka Teacher Advisors’ Service and

Sri Lanka Teachers’ Service to remove the salary

anomalies of the Teachers and Principals and

the special allowance of Rs. 5,000 as announced

by the Ministry of Finance, both effective from

January 2022, will have a positive impact in terms

of public sector wages.
