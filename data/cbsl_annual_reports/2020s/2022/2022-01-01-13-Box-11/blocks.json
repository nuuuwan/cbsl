Cryptocurrencies are not issued by any central authority such as a Central Bank. This also make cryptocurrencies less affected by government interventions and thereby possibly impacting the effectiveness of central bank monetary policy. On the other hand, CBDCs that will be issued by a country\u2019s monetary authority will act as a digital token of the country's official currency.

Further, such FinTech enabling regulatory framework shall need to be continuously evolving to reflect the changes introduced by rapidly developing FinTech industry. On the other hand, the supervisory capacity of banking supervisors needs to be significantly enhanced by moving to more technology based and automated supervisory methodologies. These will include implementing modern supervisory information systems, developing advanced data analytics capabilities, and introducing artificial intelligence assisted supervisory technology (SupTech) tools.
