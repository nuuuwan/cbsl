on extracting knowledge from various unstructured (text

Initiatives already taken by CBSL
CBSL  has  taken  multiple  steps  to  facilitate  FinTech  as 
well as to address the key risks. Some of these initiatives 
are detailed below:
Regulatory 
management and resilience 
The CBSL in 2021 introduced regulatory framework on 
technology risk management and resilience as a set of 
minimum regulatory requirements for licensed banks. The 
key characteristics of the framework are the introduction 
of  enhanced  information  security,  system  availability, 
and 
resilience 
systems, enhanced information security requirements for 
sensitive  data,  and  higher  risk  management  measures 
for domestic systemically important banks. 
The  components  of  the  regulatory  framework  include 
requirements 
technology 
information  system  availability  and  disaster  recovery, 
staff 
competencies, 
standards, and use of third-party infrastructure including 
cloud computing.
Proof-of-concept (POC) on KYC data sharing
In 2021, CBSL also completed the process of developing 
and 
testing  a  Blockchain 
Know-Your-Customer 
solution.  The  purpose  of  developing  a  Blockchain

process was to assess the potential to improve customer
