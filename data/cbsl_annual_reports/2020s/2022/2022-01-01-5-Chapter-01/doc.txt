1.1 OverviewT

he Sri Lankan economy recovered in 2021 from the pandemic induced contraction in 2020, albeit

with several deeply entrenched structural problems and vulnerabilities inherited over several

decades coming to the forefront, thereby resulting in unprecedented socio-political tensions in

early 2022. The economy was already in a fragile state lacking the necessary buffers to withstand shocks,

when it was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and other multifaceted headwinds that emanated from the

global and domestic fronts. Such vulnerability of the economy can be mainly attributed to the lack of fiscal

space, which was further constrained by the changes introduced to the tax structure in late 2019. Sri Lanka

was not an exception in the world in deploying countermeasures to face the pandemic and safeguard the

economy to forestall a lasting economic fallout and scarring effects on livelihoods. However, given particular

vulnerabilities in the economy, the Central Bank had to be heavily involved in shielding the economy through

extraordinary responses, in the form of monetary policy easing, ample liquidity provision to the markets

and the Government, and adopting several external sector and financial sector policies, in the absence of

adequate policy space in the fiscal sector or an adequately prompt response from the fiscal sector. The

ultra easy macroeconomic policy package unveiled by the Central Bank and the Government helped the

economic recovery in 2021 from the historical contraction recorded in 2020, while also helping cushion the

impact of the pandemic on a broader segment of the stakeholders. Both public and private sectors enjoyed

the comfort of low cost funds for working capital and investment that helped them stay afloat during this

difficult time, and keep industries viable, even witnessing some growth, which in turn ensured uninterrupted

provision of public services, utilities and goods and services to the public as well as other essential supply

chains. However, unprecedented policy responses taken during the peak of the pandemic together with the

inability to withdraw the policy measures due to expected fiscal responses not coming through adequately,

caused a limited space for reversal measures and led to some unintended effects on macroeconomic

stability in 2021, which were further aggravated in early 2022. Further, the pressures witnessed on the

exchange rate amidst dried up liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market were amplified in 2021 and

early 2022, warranting a measured adjustment that was allowed in the exchange rate in early March 2022,

compared to the level that prevailed in the market amidst concerns about the adverse impact of any large

depreciation of the exchange rate on the society. However, the outcome of the exchange rate flexibility that

was thereafter allowed also in early March 2022, fell short of expectations due to the large overshooting by

market forces, reflecting the significant liquidity pressures that prevailed in the domestic foreign exchange

market as well as the delay in market correction.

Price stability, which was the strongest pillar for macroeconomic stability over the last decade or so,

was challenged since the second half of 2021 due to the combined impact of global and local supply

driven causes as well as the build-up of excessive demand pressures on prices, primarily caused by the

lagged impact of extraordinary monetary accommodation, including unprecedented monetary financing that

became required due to the lack of fiscal space. Moreover, the external sector remained on the brink of a

precarious state since late 2021 due to the mounting Balance of Payments (BOP) pressures reflected in

the meagre level of official reserves amidst significant debt servicing obligations along with the dire need

to finance essential imports at a time when the domestic foreign exchange market remained largely illiquid.

Calamities in the power and energy sector, acute shortages of essentials and raw materials and the spillover

effects of these on every nook and cranny of the economy could disrupt economic activity excessively

unless resolved urgently. The actions and policy measures taken on a piecemeal basis to fix or postpone

these severe conditions have proven to be unsuccessful or created novel issues. Any notable intervention

by fiscal authorities to ease these domestic economic conditions to restore normalcy remained a remote

possibility due to historically high public debt levels, further weakening of fiscal balances and extremely low

sovereign rating. As a result, the Central Bank took swift measures in early April 2022 to preempt further

deterioration of macroeconomic stability and to restore price stability through a significant tightening of

monetary policy, among others. These policy initiatives would be imperative to commence bold structural

reforms to revitalise medium to long term macroeconomic stability, which remains a necessary condition for

long term inclusive growth.

In this regard, the implementation of several structural reforms is vital at this juncture by the Government

to complement the Central Bank’s remedial policies. Implementing strong fiscal adjustments, which have

been long delayed and often reversed in the past, will lead to a visible turnaround in the current complex

economic turmoil. Sustainable containment of the budget deficit through an upward level shift to government

revenue along with the rationalisation and prioritisation of government expenditure would help contain the

expansion of government borrowing going forward. Further, a comprehensive and coherent approach

to achieving and maintaining public debt sustainability is a must to take any step forward in addressing

the current economic problem. These essential fiscal adjustments have to be supported by financially

independent and autonomous State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs) by introducing, among others,

cost reflective pricing structures, institutionalisation of good governance and accountability mechanisms,

notable productivity enhancement and service delivery in the overall public sector, and strengthening of well

targeted social safety net schemes. While it is necessary to strengthen legal frameworks to ensure public

accountability of state institutions, exercising existing legal powers in policy formulation and implementation

by relevant authorities would ensure lasting economic welfare in the country. These changes would ensure

increased participation of the private sector with ease, while the public sector continues to play a facilitator

role in the economy.

The persistent twin deficit dilemma experienced by Sri Lanka highlights the importance of addressing

the BOP issues on a sustainable basis. National policies, which are free from changing political regimes,

formed with the support of relevant stakeholders aiming at reducing the external current account deficit

and budget deficit to a manageable level are imperative in this endeavour. Further, other non debt creating

foreign exchange generating sources need to be explored and established to build-up official reserves,

while reducing the need for external debt financing of the BOP. A conducive doing business environment

and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) promotions must supplement this external sector stabilisation package.

Recent events experienced in Sri Lanka reveal how macroeconomic stability, social cohesion and political

stability are intertwined and how the effect of one aspect could spillover to another. Thus, the overall solution

to the prevailing triple plights, i.e., economic turmoil, social unrest, and political instability, should cover all

these elements to reboot Sri Lanka to new heights. The ongoing efforts to resolve the economic issues,

including the suspension of external debt servicing by the Government for an interim period pending orderly

and consensual restructuring of debt obligations, seeking an economic adjustment programme from the

International Monetary Fund (IMF), a commitment to rationalising government expenditure and enhancing

government revenue, and continuing non aligned political and economic diplomacy, among others, are

expected to restore macroeconomic stability in the period ahead. The overall success of these efforts is

conditional on reassuring social coherence and restoring political stability and an enduring political will, to

take this reform agenda forward.

1.2 Macroeconomic Developments in 2021

Real Sector Developments and Inflation

The Sri Lankan economy rebounded in 2021,

following the COVID-19 induced contraction

in 2020. As per the provisional national accounts

estimates of the Department of Census and Statistics

(DCS), the Sri Lankan economy recorded a growth

of 3.7 per cent in 2021, in real terms, compared to the

contraction of 3.6 per cent recorded in the preceding

year. All sectors of the economy registered growth

during the year (agriculture, forestry and fishing by

2.0 per cent; industry by 5.3 per cent; and services

by 3.0 per cent). The performance of the agriculture,

forestry and fishing sector was buoyed by the

notable growth recorded in the subcategories of

growing of cereals (except rice), oleaginous fruits,

and tea, while the contraction in the growing of rice

and other beverage crops weighed negatively on the

sectoral performance. The majority of subcategories

within the industries sector registered robust growth.

A notable exception was manufacturing activities

related to coke and refined petroleum products

which recorded a contraction of 30.5 per cent due

to occasional refinery shutdowns during the year.

All subcategories in the services sector registered

growth with IT programming, consultancy, and

related activities, and the telecommunications

sectors recording sizeable growth of 21.7 per cent

and 16.2 per cent, respectively, highlighting the

increased usage of telecommunications services

amid the pandemic and growth in the Information

Technology/ Business Process Outsourcing (IT/

BPO) sector. The taxes less subsidies component

of GDP grew by 4.9 per cent in 2021 driven by

improvements in tax revenues, when compared to

2020, in line with the post COVID-19 recovery in

economic activity and declines in subsidies.

In nominal terms, the Sri Lankan economy

recorded a notable growth of 11.9 per cent in

2021, compared to the tepid expansion of 0.2 per

cent observed in 2020. Accordingly, the overall size

of the economy expanded to US dollars 84.5 billion in

2021 from US dollars 81.0 billion in the previous year.

Per capita GDP grew to US dollars 3,815 in 2021

from US dollars 3,695 in 2020. On the expenditure

front, final consumption expenditure recorded a

significant growth of 9.9 per cent at current prices in

2021, compared to the relatively modest growth of

2.0 per cent seen in 2020. This growth was largely

driven by household consumption expenditure which

grew by 10.8 per cent during the year, compared to

just 1.0 per cent growth during the previous year.

However, government consumption expenditure at

current prices grew at a relatively modest pace of

3.7 per cent in 2021, compared to the growth of 9.9

per cent that was observed in 2020. The share of

consumption expenditure in GDP at current prices

stood at 79.9 per cent in 2021. Meanwhile, gross

domestic capital formation registered a growth of

23.2 per cent in 2021, compared to the contractions

recorded in both 2020 and 2019. The share of

gross capital formation in nominal GDP improved

marginally to 27.7 per cent in 2021. Net external

demand for goods and services deteriorated sharply,

registering a decline of 31.6 per cent in 2021 with

the growth in imports outweighing the growth in

exports. While a rise in private savings led to a

notable growth of 20.3 per cent in domestic savings,

the low government revenue led to an increase in

government dissavings. Accordingly, domestic

savings as a percentage of GDP stood at 20.1 per

cent in 2021, compared to 18.7 per cent in 2020.

The domestic savings-investment gap widened

to -7.6 per cent of GDP in 2021, compared to

-6.4 per cent of GDP in 2020. The national

savings-investment gap widened from -1.6 per cent

of GDP in 2020 to -3.9 per cent of GDP in 2021,

driven by the growth in investment expenditure.

While the steady recovery of the economy

led to the decline in the unemployment rate, the

increase in both the labour force and inactive

population led to a decline in labour force

participation during the year. The unemployment

rate declined to 5.1 per cent in 2021 from the

5.5 per cent recorded during the previous year.

Unemployment rates amongst males and females

also followed suit, declining to 3.7 per cent and

7.9 per cent, respectively, in 2021, from 4.0 per cent

and 8.5 per cent, respectively, in 2020. Meanwhile,

the economically inactive population increased by

3.7 per cent to 8.6 million in 2021, compared to 2020

with dampened interest in active job search and

pandemic induced hardships on usual routines. This

development, alongside the marginal increase of

1.0 per cent in the labour force resulted in a decline

in the overall labour force participation rate (LFPR)

to 49.9 per cent in 2021 compared to 50.6 per cent

in 2020. LFPR of both males and females declined

from 71.9 per cent and 32.0 per cent,

respectively, in 2020, to 71.0 per cent and

31.8 per cent, respectively, in 2021. The

agriculture, industry, and services sectors

accounted for 27.3 per cent, 26.0 per cent, and

46.7 per cent of the total employment, respectively.

Headline inflation accelerated in 2021 driven

mainly by global and domestic supply side

disturbances, the surge in global commodity

prices and upward revisions to administered

prices, while core inflation also accelerated

reflecting the lagged effect of significant monetary

accommodation. As reflected by the year-on-year

change in both the National Consumer Price Index

(NCPI, 2013=100) and the Colombo Consumer Price

Index (CCPI, 2013=100), the acceleration in headline

inflation was attributed to the acceleration in both food

and non food inflation, though food inflation accounted

for a larger share. Several upward revisions made to

energy prices and other administrative prices reflected

the rise in prices in the international market as well as

volatile food prices stemming from the pandemic related

supply side disruptions and the loss of production of

certain items, mostly contributed to such acceleration

in inflation. Spillover of the aforementioned revisions

alongside external shock absorption methods, such

as the removal of maximum retail prices also partly

contributed to the rise in inflation. Accordingly, year-

on-year headline inflation, as measured by the CCPI,

which was recorded at 4.2 per cent at end 2020,

accelerated to 12.1 per cent by end 2021, breaching

the target level of 4-6 per cent. Following a similar

trend, year-on-year headline inflation, based on the

NCPI, also accelerated and was recorded at 14.0

per cent by end 2021, compared to 4.6 per cent at

end 2020. The upward trend of headline inflation has

continued thus far in 2022. Accordingly, year-on-year

headline inflation based on the CCPI accelerated

to 18.7 per cent in March 2022, while that of NCPI

also accelerated to 21.5 per cent in March 2022.

Core inflation, which measures underlying demand

pressures, also accelerated sharply from mid 2021,

reflecting demand driven inflationary pressures

triggered by the impact of the lagged effects of

pandemic related significant monetary policy

accommodation. Accordingly, year-on-year core

inflation, based on the CCPI accelerated to 8.3 per

cent by end 2021 from 3.5 per cent recorded at end

2020. NCPI based core inflation accelerated to 10.8

per cent, year-on-year, by end 2021 in comparison to

4.7 per cent at end 2020. Further, continuing the same

trend, CCPI based year-on-year core inflation rose to

13.0 per cent by March 2022, while NCPI based year-

on-year core inflation rose to 17.3 per cent by March

2022. The strong proactive policy measures taken

by the Central Bank are expected to arrest further

build-up of demand driven inflationary pressures and

adverse inflation expectations, supporting to revert

inflation rates towards the target range in the period

ahead.

External Sector Developments

Sri Lanka’s external sector continues to

face numerous challenges, including a sharp

widening of the current account deficit, limited

inflows to the financial account, depletion of

gross official reserves (GOR) as a result of large

debt servicing requirements and significant

depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee. Regardless

of the notable momentum in merchandise exports

compared to the previous year, a high increase in

merchandise imports, which outpaced the growth

in exports, widened the trade deficit in 2021.

Increased import expenditure was mainly due to

the combined effect of sharp revival in imports,

particularly in the latter part of the year, primarily

driven by higher commodity prices, including

prices of fuel, increased demand for imported

items due to normalisation of economic activity,

higher importation of medical and pharmaceutical

items such as vaccines, and the relaxation of

some of the restrictions on importation of non

essential goods. The services sector surplus

remained subdued, compared to the pre-pandemic

level. However, there was a gradual increase in

earnings from tourism towards the end of the year

whilst a healthy growth was observed in exports

of computer services. The deficit in the primary

income account recorded a contraction with a

reduction in interest and coupon payments as well

as dividend payments. Meanwhile, the surplus in

the secondary income account reduced as a result

of a notable contraction in workers’ remittances

received by the banking system. With these

developments, the deficit in the external current

account widened significantly to US dollars 3.3

billion in 2021 (4.0 per cent of GDP), compared

to US dollars 1.2 billion in 2020 (1.5 per cent of

GDP). The financing of the current account deficit

was achieved by drawing down GOR amidst

moderate inflows to the financial account and

continuous foreign debt service payments. Foreign

investment in the form of FDI remained modest

while foreign investment to the stock market and

the government securities market recorded net

outflows during the year. Amidst significant debt

servicing obligations falling due during the year, the

Government and the Central Bank received some

inflows that enabled replenishment of the GOR

to a certain extent. These included the Special

Drawing Rights (SDR) allocation by the IMF, two

foreign currency term financing facilities from

the China Development Bank, and international

currency swap agreements with the People’s

Bank of China (PBOC) and the Bangladesh Bank.

However, there were substantial outflows from

official reserves due to debt service payments

as well as the supply of foreign exchange to the

domestic foreign exchange market to facilitate

the importation of essential goods. As a result,

the GOR declined to US dollars 3.1 billion by end

2021, compared to US dollars 5.7 billion recorded

as of end 2020. Accordingly, the overall balance

of the BOP recorded a significant deficit of around

US dollars 4.0 billion in 2021. Meanwhile, the

total external debt of the Government, based

on market value, declined marginally as a result

of the combined effect of the decline in market

prices of Sri Lanka’s outstanding International

Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) and the repayment of

an ISB, although the outstanding foreign loans of

the Government recorded an increase during the

year. Further, the outstanding external liabilities

of the Central Bank increased significantly due

to the net impact of international currency swap

arrangements. Consequently, Sri Lanka’s total

external debt increased to US dollars 50.7 billion

by end 2021 from US dollars 49.0 billion as of

end 2020. Sri Lanka settled the ISB of US dollars

1 billion that matured in July 2021 and the ISB

of US dollars 500 million that matured in January

2022. The Sri Lanka rupee was maintained

broadly at stable levels during 2021 and in early

2022, partially aided by moral suasion to keep the

currency stable around Rs. 200 levels. However,

considering the severity of the external shocks

and further adverse developments in the global

and domestic fronts, the Central Bank allowed

flexibility in the exchange rate, yet intending to keep

the rate of depreciation at a certain level, since

early March 2022 as a part of the comprehensive

policy package announced to alleviate the difficult

situation in the external sector. However, the

large pressures witnessed in the domestic foreign

exchange market caused a large overshoot in the

Sri Lanka rupee. Consequently, the Sri Lanka

rupee, which depreciated by 7.0 per cent in 2021,

depreciated significantly by 33.0 per cent by end

March 2022. The Government and the Central Bank

have identified the need for implementing urgent

measures to address external sector vulnerabilities

and for such measures to complement broader

economic reforms aimed at resolving persistent

and long-standing issues in the economy. While

many regional countries and institutions have

assisted the country with numerous credit lines,

international swap facilities, syndicated loans and

substantial current and capital grants, the country

is seeking an effective engagement with the IMF

and other external stakeholders in order to ensure

the sustainability of the country’s external debt for

restoring macroeconomic stability.

Fiscal Sector Developments

Fiscal sector performance, which suffers

from chronically high structural budget deficits

caused by government expenditure overruns

and government revenue slippages over

the years, has deteriorated in 2021, further

escalating the government debt stock. The fiscal

strategy outlined in the Budget 2021 was aimed at

ensuring macroeconomic stability while enhancing

economic revival and poverty alleviation, although

the envisaged fiscal outcomes were off the mark

during 2021 as a result of overly optimistic fiscal

targets, prominently in relation to government

revenue, which was not adequately supported

by felicitous fiscal policies. Government revenue

declined to a historic low level of 8.7 per cent of

GDP in 2021 as against 9.1 per cent of GDP in

2020. Actual revenue collection significantly

deviated from the original budget estimate of 11.1

per cent of GDP, owing to the loss of revenue

flows which was a result of the tax relaxations

implemented in late 2019 and early 2020, slower

than expected economic revival, as well as the

continuation of some import restrictions. However,

in nominal terms, government revenue recorded

a moderate growth of 6.5 per cent, year-on-year.

Income taxes, Value Added Tax (VAT), Ports and

Airports Development Levy (PAL) and CESS levy

contributed to the nominal growth in government

revenue, although the revenue mobilised through

import duty, excise duty and Special Commodity

Levy (SCL) declined primarily due to import

restrictions. The rate of growth in government

revenue failed to keep pace with the rate of growth in

national income in 2021, as in the past, mainly due

to the continuation of a plethora of tax incentives

introduced since late 2019 and additional direct and

indirect concessionary tax reforms introduced since

the onset of the pandemic and under the Budget

2021. On the other hand, government expenditure,

in nominal terms, increased by 15.8 per cent,

year-on-year, to Rs. 3,521.7 billion in 2021.

Accordingly, government expenditure as a

percentage of GDP increased to 21.0 per cent in

2021 from 20.2 per cent in 2020. Higher expenditure

on salaries and wages and interest expenses,

which stood at 11.3 per cent of GDP in 2021 and

130.0 per cent of government revenue, drove the

growth in recurrent expenditure. Moreover, capital

expenditure and net lending increased by 57.2 per

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

1Background

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an organisation established in 1944 to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world. The IMF usually provides loans under its programmes to member countries that experience Balance of Payments (BOP) problems to support rebuilding international reserves, stabilising currencies, ensuring continuity in payments for imports, and restoring economic growth, while correcting underlying problems. All IMF members are eligible to access IMF’s resources in the General Resources Account (GRA) on non concessional terms, and the IMF also provides concessional financial support through the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), which is tailored to the diversity and needs of low-income countries. For emerging and advanced market economies in crises, IMF assistance is provided through Stand-By Arrangements (SBAs) to address short term or potential BOP problems. The Stand-By Credit Facility (SCF) serves a similar purpose for low-income countries. The Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the corresponding Extended Credit Facility (ECF) for low-income countries are the main facilities aimed at providing medium term support to countries facing protracted BOP problems. To help prevent or mitigate crises and boost market confidence, members with already strong policies can use the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) or the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL). The Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) and the corresponding Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) for low-income countries provide rapid assistance to countries with urgent BOP needs, including difficulties posed by commodity price shocks, natural disasters, and domestic fragilities. Objectives, policies and conditionality under an IMF funding arrangement depend on a country’s specific economic circumstances.

The prime concern often raised with regard to approaching the IMF for a programme is the conditionalities attached to it. Conditionalities in IMF programmes in general cover key macroeconomic and structural policy adjustments. Even though these conditionalities were largely focused on macroeconomic policies until the early 1980s, the complexity and scope of structural conditions increased subsequently, reflecting the IMF’s growing involvement in low-income and transitional countries. These conditionalities are intended to help countries resolve BOP problems, while avoiding recurring instances of such problems. Further, the remedial measures are intended to ensure that the country’s BOP will be strong enough to meet payments for imports and to service external debt in a sustained manner.

The policy commitments agreed with country authorities generally include:

Prior Actions (PA): These are the steps a country agrees to take before the IMF approves financing under a

BOX 1The Importance of International Monetary Fund Programmes

programme. Such actions are set out to ensure that a country has the required foundation to achieve programme goals successfully. PA may generally include the elimination of price controls (if any), formulation of the government budget in consistence with the medium term fiscal framework, and taking measures to achieve debt sustainability.

Quantitative Performance Criteria (QPC): These are specific, measurable conditions relating to macroeconomic variables under the control of the authorities, such as monetary and credit aggregates, international reserves, fiscal balances, and external borrowing. QPC may generally include a minimum level of government primary balance, a ceiling on government borrowing, and a minimum level of international reserves.

Indicative Targets (IT): IT may be set for quantitative indicators to assess progress in meeting programme objectives. IT are sometimes set instead of QPC because of uncertainty about economic trends. As uncertainty is reduced, these targets may become QPC, with appropriate modifications. IT may generally include a minimum level of the government primary balance, a minimum level of domestic revenue collection, and a minimum level of social assistance spending.

Structural Benchmarks (SB): These are reform measures that often are non quantifiable but are critical for achieving programme goals. SB may generally include improvements in financial sector operations, building up social safety nets, and strengthening public financial management.

The Success of IMF Programmes in Terms of Fulfilling Conditions

The IMF periodically reviews the performance of its programmes. An IMF programme is designed in such a way that disbursements of funds are conditional on meeting QPC, IT, etc. To improve the programme’s success and reduce risks, the IMF recommends measures to improve the practicality of projections, sharpen debt sustainability analysis, enhance the quality of fiscal consolidation, and improve the tailoring of structural conditions. For the RCF and the RFI facilities provided by the IMF, there is no ex-post programme based conditionality or reviews except for limited overall conditionality. If a country fails to meet QPC, the IMF Executive Board may approve a waiver if it is satisfied that the programme will still succeed, provided that the deviation is minor/temporary or national authorities are taking corrective actions. Missed structural benchmarks and indicative targets do not require waivers but are assessed in the context of overall programme performance.

History of Sri Lanka's Relationship with the IMF

Sri Lanka has engaged in sixteen IMF programmes since obtaining membership of the IMF in 1950. Sri Lanka’s first IMF programme was in 1965 and the last was in 2016. The most successful IMF programme was the SBA which commenced in 2009, in which the IMF disbursed the full allocation of funds to Sri Lanka. The previous IMF programmes concentrated primarily on improving foreign reserves and the conduct of monetary policy. In addition, there was emphasis on undertaking vital structural reforms that included the introduction of a fuel price formula, improving the Central Bank’s independence, a flexible exchange rate policy, and revenue based fiscal consolidation. In the Sri Lankan context, for official dealings with the IMF, the Hon. Minister of Finance holds the capacity of the Governor of the IMF, and the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) holds the capacity of the Alternate Governor of the IMF.

In addition, the IMF has extended many technical assistance opportunities to the CBSL and to the Government, including the Forecasting and Policy Analysis System (FPAS) model that was aimed at improving the technical capacity of the CBSL in its transition to the flexible inflation targeting framework.

The Overall Success of IMF Programmes in Sri Lanka

Despite being part of many programmes since the first in 1965, only a few IMF programmes in Sri Lanka have been successfully implemented by authorities. This has been mainly due to the lack of commitment in meeting the conditionalities attached to such programmes, especially those related to structural reforms, which required painful macroeconomic adjustments and unpopular policies that were aimed at

long term productivity improvements in the economy. Notably, the need to seek external assistance is a result of the failure to take initiative as a country to introduce structural reforms, which are often included in IMF programmes as well. Most reforms identified in the previous IMF programmes have not been completed fully or abandoned abruptly after drawing some disbursements under the financing facilities, while meeting only short term objectives. This has led to a cycle of being in and out of IMF programmes frequently as shown in Table B 1.1. In contrast, India, which obtained seven programmes from the IMF during 1951 to 1993, has not approached the IMF since the conclusion of its last programme in 1993. If an IMF programme is completed successfully, the economy would be able to reap the long term benefits, especially through structural adjustments, and the need to approach the IMF on future occasions of short term economic stresses would have been minimal. A summary of the success of the latest IMF programmes extended in 2009 and 2016 to Sri Lanka in terms of fulfilling the conditionalities is as follows.

IMF-SBA Programme in 2009

As per the IMF staff report for the eighth and final review under the SBA, Sri Lanka fulfilled the net international reserve targets, net domestic financing and reserve money indicative targets related to the programme. Sri Lanka also implemented all structural benchmarks, except the proposed reforms to the regulatory framework for private pension funds prior to the expiration of the programme.

IMF-EFF Programme in 2016

As per the IMF staff report for the sixth review under the EFF, Sri Lanka was unable to meet fiscal targets due to the significant revenue shortfalls after

Implications of a Future IMF Programme on Sri Lanka

As previously mentioned, Sri Lanka has entered into IMF programmes from time to time to support the BOP position and the Government’s reforms agenda. However, unlike in previous occasions, in the current context, an IMF programme will be an important part of strategies to overcome prevailing challenging economic conditions in the country. Considering the current low level of international reserves, servicing the significantly high debt repayments due in the near term will be extremely challenging. Liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market has dried up amidst high foreign debt service payments and the reduction in foreign exchange inflows, resulting in significant depletion of gross official reserves and inadequate foreign exchange to meet the forex demands for essential imports, such as fuel, gas, coal, medicine, and essential food items. In this context, there is a need for securing a sizeable amount of foreign financing in the immediate future. Entering into an IMF programme would not only provide access to additional financing but would also enhance the confidence of potential foreign investors, including multilateral and bilateral counterparts. This, coupled with the implementation of a macroeconomic policy package, is expected to stabilise the overall macroeconomy which will further promote non debt creating financial inflows.

Major areas that could be expected to be considered in the discussion of a potential IMF programme could include fiscal consolidation, appropriate monetary policy stance, exchange rate flexibility, phasing out of monetary financing, reforms of SOBEs, the gradual unwinding of capital flow management measures, the introduction of market based pricing formulae for utilities and strengthening social safety nets, among others. Some of the aforementioned measures have been already implemented by the CBSL and the Government. The monetary policy has been significantly tightened,

the exchange rate is increasingly being determined by market forces, and adjustments to prices of domestic petroleum and LP gas have been allowed to reflect costs. These macroeconomic stabilisation measures could result in a painful adjustment to the economy in the adjustment stage, but it has become imperative considering the current economic crisis. However, in order to successfully implement an IMF programme, the country should ensure the management of external debt sustainably through appropriate measures. Towards this end, the Government has already announced the suspension of external debt servicing for an interim period pending an orderly and consensual restructuring of debt obligations in a manner consistent with an economic adjustment programme supported by the IMF. Further, political and social stability needs to be achieved through an agreement between all relevant stakeholders to successfully negotiate and implement an IMF programme. The success of this will also rest on the extent to which the long neglected structural reforms are implemented in a way that ensures sustainable macroeconomic stability.

public investment declined by 2.7 per cent in 2021.

The expenditure rationalisation plan was derailed

with rigid recurrent spending and additional

expenditure requirements of public health services

and direct and indirect financial support provided

to pandemic affected households and businesses.

The overall fiscal deficit, as a percentage of GDP,

worsened to 12.2 per cent (Rs. 2,057.9 billion)

in 2021 from 11.1 per cent (Rs. 1,667.7 billion)

recorded in the preceding year. Meanwhile, the

primary deficit in 2021 increased from Rs. 687.4

billion (4.6 per cent of the GDP) in 2020 to Rs.

1,009.5 billion (6.0 per cent of the GDP) in 2021,

highlighting the inadequacy of government revenue

to meet at least non interest expenditure of the

year. The current account deficit, which reflects

the dissavings of the Government, also widened in

nominal terms from Rs. 1,180.4 billion in 2020 to

Rs. 1,290.4 billion in 2021, while declining

marginally to 7.7 per cent in 2021 from

7.9 per cent in the previous year, as a percentage

of the GDP. With these developments, the primary

deficit, current account deficit, and overall budget

deficit, as percentages of GDP, notably deviated

financial markets resulting from the adverse global

developments and sovereign rating downgrades,

the Government relied heavily on domestic

sources, especially the banking sector, to finance

the budget deficit. Accordingly, during 2021, net

financing through domestic sources amounted to

Rs. 2,071.8 billion, whereas a net repayment of

Rs. 13.9 billion was registered in relation to foreign

sources. The Government relied on financing from

the banking sector on a large scale, especially from

the Central Bank, to meet the rising expenditure

requirements and debt servicing obligations in

2021. As a result, the Central Bank accounted for

Rs. 1,225.2 billion of domestic bank borrowings of

the Government in 2021. The wider fiscal deficit,

increased market interest rates, as well as parity

losses caused by the depreciation of the Sri Lanka

rupee, resulted in an increase in outstanding

central government debt from Rs. 15,117.2 billion

recorded at end 2020 to Rs. 17,589.4 billion by end

2021. Accordingly, outstanding central government

debt, as a percentage of GDP, increased to 104.6

per cent by end 2021 from 100.6 per cent registered

at the end of the preceding year. In nominal terms,

domestic debt and foreign debt increased by 22.4

per cent and 7.3 per cent, respectively, by end 2021

over 2020. The increased domestic borrowings

from Treasury bills and Treasury bonds resulted

in the share of domestic debt in the government

debt portfolio to rise from 60.0 per cent in 2020 to

63.1 per cent in 2021. The total debt service

payments increased from Rs. 1,941.4 billion in

2020 to Rs. 2,375.6 billion in 2021. Accordingly,

debt service payments increased to 14.1 per

cent of GDP in 2021 from 12.9 per cent of GDP

in the preceding year. In 2021, interest payments

and capital payments amounted to 6.2 per cent

and 7.9 per cent of GDP, respectively. A series

of sovereign rating downgrades for Sri Lanka

was exercised by rating agencies during 2021,

in consideration of its worsened external liquidity

position, weakening fiscal outlook and forthcoming

substantial debt service payments. The significantly

high debt level of the Government and bunching

of foreign debt obligations in the near to medium

term raised serious concerns about external debt

sustainability of the country. Against this backdrop,

the already announced efforts of the Government

to restructure the debt portfolio, along with a strong

commitment towards fiscal consolidation efforts

and prudent liability management strategies are

expected to restore public debt sustainability in the

period ahead.

Monetary Sector Developments

Considering the possible build-up of

excessive inflationary pressures and the

imbalances that emerged in the external sector

and financial markets, the Central Bank, which

deployed unprecedented monetary stimulus

measures since 2020, commenced monetary

tightening measures in mid-August 2021. The

extremely accommodative monetary policy stance,

which was maintained by the Central Bank from the

onset of the pandemic in early 2020 through mid-

August 2021, helped reduce market interest rates

to historically low levels and provide adequate

liquidity to the domestic money market, thereby

helping individuals and businesses affected by the

pandemic, while facilitating economic recovery. The

Central Bank continued to provide extraordinary

financial support to the Government by way of

purchasing Treasury bills from the primary market,

as well as direct allocations to the Central Bank

to meet the emergency funding needs of the

Government amidst disruptions to its cashflows

resulting from low revenue mobilisation and high

expenditure during the pandemic. However, to

preempt the build-up of excessive inflationary

pressures over the medium term and to address

imbalances in the external sector and financial

markets, measures were taken to commence

tightening the monetary policy stance from August

2021 onwards. Accordingly, the key policy interest

rates, i.e., the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR)

and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR)

were raised by 50 basis points to 5.00 per cent and

6.00 per cent, respectively, in mid-August 2021, and

the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) applicable on

all rupee deposit liabilities of Licensed Commercial

Banks (LCBs) was raised by 2 percentage points

to 4.00 per cent, effective from September 2021.

Several other regulatory measures were also

taken by the Central Bank to better reflect market

conditions. The Central Bank imposed a ceiling on

interest rates offered for foreign currency deposit

products of LCBs and National Savings Bank (NSB)

in August 2021 to address the anomalies between

interest rates of rupee and foreign currency deposits

in the market. The interest rate applicable on the

special mortgage-backed housing loan scheme

for salaried employees was revised and linked to

a variable interest rate in December 2021. With

continued challenges emanating from the external

sector and inflation fronts, the Central Bank tightened

its monetary policy stance further in January and

March 2022 by raising the SDFR and the SLFR by

150 basis points each, in total. In March 2022, the

maximum interest rate imposed on foreign currency

deposits of LCBs and NSB was also removed, while

the maximum interest rates imposed on interest

rates of domestic lending products i.e., credit cards,

pre-arranged temporary overdrafts and pawning

facilities were revised upwards. With the tightening

of the monetary policy stance and rupee liquidity

concerns encountered by certain banks, liquidity

in the domestic money market, which remained

at considerable surplus levels during the first half

of 2021, declined notably into large deficit levels.

Market interest rates, which declined to historic

low levels, started to adjust upwards gradually.

Yields on government securities were also allowed

to increase with the removal of the maximum

yield rates for acceptance at primary auctions of

government securities. In early April 2022, noting

the considerable inflationary pressures driven by

substantial exchange rate depreciation, the build-

up of aggregate demand pressures, the elevated

prices of commodities globally, and domestic supply

disruptions, the Central Bank raised policy interest

rates significantly by 700 basis points, the highest

single day adjustment in recent history, to arrest the

build-up of excessive demand driven inflationary

pressures and preempt the escalation of adverse

inflationary expectations, to provide the required

impetus to stabilise the exchange rate and also to

correct anomalies observed in the market interest

rate structure. Accordingly, the SDFR and SLFR

were increased to 13.50 per cent and 14.50 per cent,

respectively, effective from the close of business on

08 April 2022. The interest caps imposed on selected

domestic lending products were also removed.

Domestic credit extended by the banking

system expanded significantly during the year

driven mainly by the notable increase in net credit

to the Government (NCG) by the Central Bank,

while net foreign assets (NFA) of the banking

system contracted resulting in a moderation of

broad money supply (M2b). Amidst the decline in

government revenue and limited access to foreign

financing, the Government’s increased funding

requirement was met largely through the domestic

banking system. Thus, NCG by the banking system

increased notably by around Rs. 1,284.4 billion in

2021, of which, about 95 per cent was funded by

the Central Bank. Credit obtained by the SOBEs

from the banking system also expanded notably by

Rs. 185.9 billion in 2021, reflecting their weak

financial positions. Supported by the low cost of

funds, credit extended to the private sector also

expanded notably by Rs. 810.5 billion in 2021.

However, with the contraction in NFA of the banking

system, particularly NFA of the Central Bank,

due to foreign currency debt service payments by

the Central Bank on behalf of the Government,

the growth of M2b moderated towards the latter

part of 2021, recording a year-on-year growth of

13.2 per cent by end 2021, compared to the growth

of 23.4 per cent recorded at end 2020.

Financial Sector Developments

Despite severe challenges faced by the

economy, the stability of Sri Lanka’s financial

systems was preserved during the year 2021.

Financial intermediation by the banking sector was

satisfactory, while the profitability of the sector

improved considerably during 2021, compared

to the previous year, due to notable increases in

both net interest income and non-interest income.

However, banks faced a severe foreign currency

liquidity shortage due to the lack of foreign inflows to

the country. Licensed Finance Companies (LFCs)

and Specialised Leasing Companies (SLCs)

sector also showed a notable overall improvement

in terms of credit growth and profitability against

the backdrop of the progressing Financial

Sector Consolidation Masterplan. The Central

Bank continued to assist financial institutions to

adapt to the new normal and provided certain

regulatory forbearances with a view to supporting

the pandemic disrupted economy. The insurance

sector also recorded an expansion. Liquidity in

the money market turned to deficit levels followed

by foreign debt repayments and a reversal of the

accommodative monetary policy stance since

August 2021. Liquidity in the domestic foreign

exchange market was at significantly low levels

owing to a delayed recovery in tourism earnings,

slow conversion of export proceeds, increase in

import expenditure as well as unfavourable market

conditions led by several sovereign downgrades

during the year. The Colombo Stock Exchange

(CSE) recorded an improvement in 2021, despite

negligible contribution by foreign investors. The

country's payment and settlement system was

operated smoothly by the Central Bank during

the period under review. Meanwhile, the Central

Bank continued to introduce reforms to major

legislations to provide a stronger legal foundation

for the regulatory and supervisory framework.

1.3 Global Economic Environment and Outlook

As the global economy begins to recover from

the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022,

the progress is being severely disrupted by the

repercussions of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

According to the World Economic Outlook (WEO)

of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released in

April 2022, global economic growth is estimated at

6.1 per cent in 2021, compared to a contraction of 3.1

per cent in 2020. During 2021, advanced economies

were estimated to have recorded a growth of 5.2

per cent, while the growth estimation for emerging

market and developing economies stood at 6.8 per

cent. The IMF projects global economic growth to

slow down to 3.6 per cent in 2022, largely reflecting

the spillover effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine

and associated sanctions imposed on Russia, on

the global economy. In addition to the war, the IMF

predicts that disruptions to global supply chains due

to frequent and large-scale lockdowns in China,

persistent inflationary pressures leading to tightening

of monetary policies of many countries and withdrawal

of fiscal policy support previously provided across the

world to cushion the impact of the pandemic could

also affect the global growth prospects adversely.

Accordingly, economic growth rates of 3.3 per cent

and 3.8 per cent are projected in 2022 for advanced

economies and emerging market and developing

economies, respectively. Further, the global growth

projection for 2023 has been revised downwards by

the IMF to 3.6 per cent, 0.2 percentage points lower

than the January 2022 WEO.

There is consensus that in addition to the

loss of lives and human suffering, the ongoing

Russia-Ukraine conflict poses significant

economic risks beyond these two countries

creating an economic toll felt worldwide. The

war is resulting in a tragic loss of lives and human

suffering and significant damages to the Ukrainian

infrastructure and consequently, the Ukrainian

economy is set to experience a deep recession in

2022. According to the IMF, the Ukrainian economy

is expected to contract by 35 per cent in 2022. The

tight trade and financial sanctions being imposed

on Russia, including oil and gas embargoes by

some large economies, freezing of assets of the

Central Bank of Russia by Western countries and

suspension from using services of the Bank for

International Settlements are expected to result

in a sharp contraction of the Russian economy in

2022 with its GDP falling by about 8.5 per cent,

while having a substantial impact on the global

economy and financial markets. The neighbouring

countries of these two nations are particularly

affected by interruptions to trade and remittances

and by the influx of refugees. According to the

IMF, the spillover effects of the war are being

transmitted to the rest of the world through five key

channels. The first and the most impactful channel

is the surge in commodity prices including energy

and other commodities such as wheat, corn,

metals and inputs for fertilisers. This has added on

to the already high inflationary pressures caused

by supply chain disruptions and the revival from

the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, inflation

is projected to remain elevated at 5.7 per cent in

advanced economies and 8.7 per cent in emerging

market and developing economies for 2022.

Secondly, countries with direct and substantial

trade and remittances linkages with Russia

and Ukraine would also be negatively affected.

Moreover, the tourist earnings of the countries

which heavily rely on Russian and Ukrainian

tourists would be affected by lower tourist arrivals

due to economic disruptions and the withdrawal

of international payment services from Russia.

Thirdly, as the integration of Russia and Ukraine

into global value chains extends beyond typical

commodity linkages, disruptions to component

manufacturing processes stemming from raw

material shortages could propagate across the

globe through cross border production networks.

The fourth channel is business confidence and

financial conditions which have already been

tightening with the commodity price pressures and

sanctions. In the Asian region, higher global food

and energy prices, tighter global financial conditions

and reduced tourism earnings would hold back

growth for some oil importing economies while oil

exporters would gain from higher fossil fuel prices.

Agriculture industries in some South and Southeast

Asian nations that rely on Russia and Ukraine for

fertiliser and grain, on the other hand, would also

be negatively affected. Capital outflows may be

triggered from the Asian region with risk aversion

in financial markets. Developments in the Chinese

economy are expected to dominate the outlook

for Asia, with a projected economic growth of 4.4

per cent in 2022. Overall, the rising global energy

and commodity prices, leading to high domestic

inflation and widening trade deficits, weakening

global demand, volatile capital flows, exchange rate

instabilities, rising borrowing costs, and tightening

global financial conditions as a result of monetary

tightening in advanced economies, could make

developing countries more vulnerable, resulting

in recession, insolvency, and halting development

processes in some cases.

Prices of energy and food commodities were

on a rising trend throughout 2021 on the back

of global demand recovery with the easing

of COVID-19 concerns and are expected to

continue to remain elevated with the ongoing

geopolitical tensions in Europe. Although

crude oil prices fell sharply with the outbreak of

COVID-19 in 2020, prices were steadily rising from

April 2020 onwards and reached pre-pandemic

levels by March 2021 before reaching seven-year

highs in October 2021. The recent emergence of

geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine

led crude oil prices to remain above US dollars

100 per barrel due to concerns of further tightening

of global crude oil supplies as buyers remained

19

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

apprehensive of purchasing from Russia. As per

the April 2022 WEO, the average crude oil price

for 2022 is forecast at US dollars 106.83 per barrel,

thereby signalling the strong likelihood that crude

oil prices will remain elevated throughout the year

despite some downward pressures stemming

from outbreaks of COVID-19 and related mobility

restrictions, as those that are being seen in China

and the expectation of release of additional

supplies of oil from countries’ strategic reserves.

In relation to food prices, during 2021, the Food

and Agriculture Organisation’s (FAO) Food Price

Index depicted an overall growth of 28.1 per cent

above the prices observed in 2020. Global food

prices were on an upward trend amid high cost

of inputs, unfavourable climate conditions and

hesitation to increase production amid COVID-19

related uncertainties. These concerns continued

to linger and will continue to be aggravated by the

geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine,

both of whom are key agricultural exporters. This

led to the index continuing to escalate during the

first three months of 2022.

Most central banks around the world adopted

substantial monetary easing measures during

2020 and in early 2021 leading to policy interest

rates of many economies reaching historically

low levels. Contributed by multiple policy support,

including that of monetary policy, and successful

vaccination programmes, the world economy

started showing signs of recovery during 2021. In

particular, demand conditions in many countries

started to normalise faster than supply conditions,

thereby creating price pressures across multiple

sectors. As a result, several countries, especially

developed economies, began to unwind the large

monetary policy easing measures undertaken

thus far and to tighten monetary conditions in view

of rising inflationary pressures and unfavourable

inflation expectations. Further, the recent global

political uncertainty and supply disruptions, driven

by the Russia-Ukraine war, have also created added

pressures on price levels in most economies, forcing

many governments to undertake policy measures to

address inflation rates that are substantially higher

than the levels projected and experienced in the

recent past. The Federal Reserve of the United

States, which had kept the federal funds target rate

range at 0.00 per cent to 0.25 per cent for the last

two years, increased it by 25 basis points in March

2022, in view of rising inflationary pressures, as US

inflation had increased to a 40-year high in early

2022. In addition to this policy rate increase, the

Federal Reserve also signalled further tightening of

monetary policy with policy rate hikes and shrinking

of its balance sheet over the near term. The Bank

of England (BoE), which adopted an accommodative

policy stance from early 2020 onwards to support the

pandemic hit economy, commenced tightening the

monetary policy stance from late 2021. By end March

2022, BoE had raised its Bank Rate by 65 basis points

in three steps compared to the rate that prevailed

during the pandemic. Since the refinance rate of the

European Central Bank (ECB) had already reached

the zero level, policy accommodation during the

pandemic in the euro area was primarily conducted

with asset purchase programmes. However, net

asset purchases are expected to be gradually

reduced, while any adjustments to policy rates are

expected to take place sometime after the end of

net asset purchases. The ECB has also affirmed

the provisioning of forward guidance on the interest

rate path. Meanwhile, several Asian economies,

including China, continued to adopt accommodative

policies to further support economic growth. The

People’s Bank of China (PBoC) continued to relax

monetary policy in early 2022 as well, amidst modest

levels of inflation and growth concerns due to

issues in the property sector and resurgence of the

COVID-19 pandemic in some areas. The Reserve

Bank of India (RBI) continued to maintain the relaxed

20

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

1

monetary policy stance while focusing on withdrawal

of monetary stimuli to ensure that inflation remains

within the target in the period ahead. Bank Negara

Malaysia (BNM), which brought down its overnight

policy rate to 1.75 per cent in several steps in mid-

2020, continued the relaxed monetary policy stance

by maintaining the policy rate unchanged from 2021

into early 2022. Since demand driven inflationary

pressures remained subdued and medium-term

inflation projections were expected to return to target

levels with the stabilisation of energy and food prices,

Bank of Thailand (BoT) continued to maintain the

emphasis on supporting the recovery of the economy

by maintaining its dovish policy stance. Similarly,

Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) also continued

to maintain the accommodative policy stance during

2021, and had not deviated from it by March 2022

to support growth momentum, but emphasised its

readiness to address inflationary pressures that

could de-anchor inflation expectations. The policy

behaviour of Indonesia was also similar to the other

South East Asian economies discussed above,

where Bank Indonesia (BI) maintained its policy

rate stable since early 2021 onwards. At the same

time, BI continued to normalise liquidity conditions

by incrementally raising reserve requirements.

In contrast to the almost synchronous policy

accommodations by most central banks across the

world in response to the COVID-19 pandemic during

2020, the winding up of such accommodative policy

measures seem to be divergent across countries,

due to varying levels of inflationary pressures,

underlying causes of such pressures, and concerns

about growth outlook. Some economies seem to

have managed inflationary pressures better than

others, particularly with supply side adjustments,

while most countries have attempted to strike a

balance between price stability and post pandemic

growth recovery. However, by March 2022, the

developments regarding the Russia-Ukraine war

had led to substantial uncertainty over global

economic outlook. The April 2022 WEO states that

the appropriate monetary response across countries

may vary considerably as the transmission of the

effects of the war could be diverse across various

economies, and highlights the importance of clear

communication and data driven forward guidance

in order to maintain policy credibility over the period

ahead.

1.4 Macroeconomic Outlook

Sri Lanka’s economy is envisaged to grow

modestly in the near term as the economy is

to reset with a debt restructuring programme

and long overdue structural reforms alongside

an economic adjustment programme to be

supported by the IMF, which is expected to

facilitate the economy to gather momentum over

the medium term. The build-up of macroeconomic

instability in the economy, stemming from the

heightened vulnerabilities on both the external and

fiscal fronts, rising social unrest and political instability,

effects of the pandemic, the domestic energy crisis,

and elevated commodity prices both globally and

domestically are expected to significantly dampen

the growth prospects in 2022 and have lingering

effects in the immediate future leading to a slowdown

in growth. Also, economic activity is likely to further

slowdown amidst the announcement of a suspension

of external debt servicing by the Government for an

interim period and commitment to a debt restructuring

programme. However, the commissioning of prudent

macroeconomic policies aimed at stabilisation of the

domestic economy coupled with an IMF engagement,

improved monetary and fiscal policy coordination and

envisaged SOBE reforms is expected to restore the

pace of growth over the medium term. The aggressive

tightening of monetary policy is expected to contain

excessive inflationary pressures in the economy,

thereby anchoring inflation expectations, which is

21

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

pivotal in establishing a conducive environment for

investment. However, in the short run, a notable

rise in the interest rates would discourage lending,

and in turn hamper economic growth, but would

address interest rate anomalies and pressures on the

exchange rate to a certain extent, thereby attracting

productive investment in the medium to long run. The

tightened monetary policy would be instrumental in

stabilising the external value of the domestic currency

favourably, facilitating the influx of foreign exchange.

While the expansion of credit to the private sector as

well as broad money supply are expected to remain

somewhat subdued in 2023 due to the lagged effects

of tight monetary policy, growth of broad money and

private sector credit is expected to normalise and

improve from 2024 onwards over to the medium

term amidst a moderation in the expansion of NCG,

as the envisaged fiscal consolidation efforts would

materialise. Earnings from exports are expected to

moderate during 2022 before strengthening in the

period ahead with the envisaged recovery in global

demand, favourable exchange rates, and the policies

to improve the tradable sector. Demand for imports is

expected to dampen due to tight monetary policy and

difficulties in financing imports in 2022 and in the period

ahead, whilst higher global commodity prices including

fuel are likely to keep imports relatively at elevated

levels. The envisaged improvement in earnings from

exports is expected to result in a contraction of the

trade deficit in the medium term. Meanwhile, with the

gradual normalisation of the world economy as well

as the people mobility across the globe, Sri Lanka is

likely to benefit from the tourism industry in the period

ahead, once the socioeconomic unrest witnessed at

present eases away. This, together with the expected

rebound of activities in transport services and high

growth in the IT/BPO services subsector is envisaged

to strengthen the surplus in the services account over

the medium term. The primary income account deficit

is expected to moderate in the period ahead with the

expected savings on interest payments on account of

external debt due to the suspension of external debt

servicing for an interim period, and the envisaged

commencement of the debt restructuring programme.

Further, workers’ remittances are expected to improve

steadily over the medium term with the gradual

improvement in departures for foreign employment,the

improvement of global travel,increased demand for

migrant labour and expected recovery in the flow of

remittances through official channels. Consequently,

the external current account deficit is expected to

decline gradually to a sustainable level. Moreover,

financial flows are expected to strengthen over the

medium term with the envisaged non debt creating

inflows to the Colombo Port City and the development

of industrial zones, such as the Hambantota Industrial

Zone. Inflows to the financial account are expected

to be supported by the enhanced investor confidence

expected from the debt restructuring programme

and the envisaged engagement with an economic

adjustment programme supported by the IMF.

Meanwhile, the Government’s commitment towards

fiscal consolidation, along with measures to improve

revenue mobilisation with an appropriate tax structure

as well as efforts to mobilise non debt creating foreign

flows are essential to support the growth drive of the

economy. Accordingly, the Sri Lankan economy is

expected to accelerate gradually from 2023 onwards

to reach its growth potential in the medium term,

supported by prudent macroeconomic policies aimed

at economic stabilisation, thereby expanding the

productive potential of the economy while addressing

long lasting structural issues.

Projections of the Medium Term

Macroeconomic Framework require adequate

information on the impact of recently announced

policy changes (in early April 2022), including

the commencement of negotiations for an

IMF programme, forthcoming restructuring

of external debt obligations, efforts towards

strengthening fiscal consolidation, along with

the introduction of various structural reforms.

As most of these policy announcements are

currently at the initial stage, the Medium Term

Macroeconomic Framework published regularly

in the Annual Report of the Central Bank is

not available; instead, only the projections for

major macroeconomic variables for 2022 are

provided. Once informed projections for major

macroeconomic variables become available the

Medium Term Macroeconomic Framework will be

made available in forthcoming publications of the

Central Bank.

1.5 Issues and Policies

Over several decades, the Sri Lankan

economy outpaced its peers as reflected by

the economic and social changes that had

taken place, particularly in terms of reasonable

economic growth and development indicators

along with the consistent investment in

social infrastructure, although the country’s

economic prospects have been overshadowed

by persistent structural impediments that need

to be addressed with a sense of urgency to

ensure sustained macroeconomic stability and

inclusive growth. At the time of independence,

Sri Lanka was well poised for rapid economic

growth and development and appeared to be one

of Asia’s most promising nations. The country’s

unique strategic geographical location and identity

as a leading maritime and commercial hub in the

main sea route and being a classical model of

23

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

the gradual evolution towards independence,1

coupled with several other positives, including non-

aligned diplomacy, well established democracy,

continuous investment in human capital and

social infrastructure in terms of free education

resulting in high levels of literacy and free health

yielding increased life expectancy, investments

in the capital stock yielding the improvements

in physical infrastructure, as well as progressive

economic policies towards market orientation

and trade openness implemented ahead of many

other emerging economies, provided a conducive

environment for a smooth transformation of the

economy to become a prosperous nation in Asia.

In spite of such achievements, the country’s long

term economic progress has been significantly

below its potential, thereby delaying the path

towards prosperity. The Sri Lankan economy

was able to transition from a low income country

to a lower middle income status only during the

new millennium, but even such progress was not

sustained to reach higher economic status for the

benefit of the people. As such, the progress of

the economy to become a high income country

was nipped by a myriad of challenges. During the

last seven decades since the independence, the

economic performance was withered by a host of

factors such as the internal conflicts, calamitous

natural and manmade disasters, diseases,

intermittent external shocks, weak institutions,

issues in relation to accountability, transparency,

and governance, including corruption, waste,

nepotism, and certain episodes of political

instability, and above all, weaknesses in effective

economic management. As a result, the economy

is persistently saddled with volatility in growth,

high inflationary episodes, fiscal imbalances,

particularly in terms of persistently large fiscal

deficits and debt burden, and the spillover effects

1 Lee Kuan Yew. 2000. From Third World To First: The Singapore Story: 1965–2000, Singapore: Singapore Press Holdings

of fiscal imbalances on the external and monetary

sector stability. The twin deficit challenge, namely

the budget deficit and the external current account

deficit, emanating from the imbalances due to

excessive spending over and above the country’s

capacity and reflecting the imbalances in the fiscal

and external sectors, remains the major structural

impediment and the key source of economic

vulnerability in Sri Lanka. The country is one of

the classic examples to prove that prolonged

fiscal expansions contribute to current account

imbalances thus yielding several macroeconomic

ailments. In this context, the commitment towards

fiscal prudence of successive governments to

address such prolonged fiscal imbalances has

been short-lived as reflected in the expanding

budget deficits, and in turn, the rising public debt

and the associated interest costs to disconcerting

levels. On the other hand, the external sector has

been plagued by meagre export performance

amidst high import expenditure, high external

debt challenge, and the misaligned exchange

rate, posing risks to macroeconomic stability.

Inconsistent fiscal policies driven by the socially

and politically populist short term motives, instead

of adopting consistent national policies with a focus

on long term economic progress, have caused a

sequence of detrimental consequences towards

achieving the country’s macroeconomic objectives

as well as the overall welfare of the citizens.

Against this backdrop, Sri Lanka has often failed

to harness the strength of its economic endowment

and reach full economic potential by drawing

lessons from the success stories of its peers,

who have surpassed Sri Lanka in terms of both

social and economic development. Moreover, the

outbreak of the pandemic and related uncertainties

have severely undermined the past achievements

of the Sri Lankan economy, while intensifying its

macroeconomic fragilities. Amidst the disruptions

of the pandemic, several longstanding unresolved

24

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

1

structural impediments, which have been left

unaddressed and postponed repeatedly, have

now resurfaced impeding the economic recovery,

despite unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimuli

offered by the monetary and fiscal authorities,

respectively. This underscores the need for having

a credible macroeconomic plan and a national

policy agenda to address persistent and severe

macroeconomic imbalances. Therefore, ambitious

and consolidated efforts with appropriate and

consistent policy directives are required to be

implemented expeditiously by way of charting a

strong macroeconomic management framework

to address long due structural issues and new

challenges surfaced by the pandemic. Such efforts

would pave the way for the country to move towards

the envisaged higher growth trajectory over the

medium term, while ensuring stable economic

conditions, which will ultimately yield improved

living standards for the people.

In the above context, several structural issues

and policies are discussed with the view to

highlighting key areas in the economy that needs

special and urgent attention.

Achieving a sustainable current account

balance by enhancing net inflows from goods

and services exports as well as by promoting

workers’ remittances is imperative to overcome

the heightened vulnerabilities stemming from

external sector imbalances. The persistent

external current account deficit remains one of the

key and largely unaddressed vulnerabilities in Sri

Lanka’s macroeconomic landscape. This is mainly

driven by continuously widening deficits in the trade

and primary income accounts that are too large to be

offset by the surpluses in the services and secondary

income accounts. Sri Lanka’s exports in the last

few decades have seen no major growth drive or

boom due to longstanding issues such as limited

diversification, low value addition, slower integration

to global value chains and the lack of sophistication

required to remain competitive, amidst inadequate

investments in the tradable sector. In the meantime,

expenditure on imports, including non essential

and non urgent imports, have increased at a faster

pace leading to substantial trade deficits. Sri Lanka

was ahead of its regional peers in liberalising the

economy in 1977 and the adoption of liberal economic

policies, such as private sector driven development,

export led growth, and promoting FDI, that led to the

immediate realisation of notable improvements in

foreign trade. However, during the last few decades,

Sri Lanka’s international trade performance has been

lacklustre and regressing continuously, ultimately

contributing to the widening of the external current

account deficit, which has been mainly financed

through external sector borrowings, amidst limited

FDI. These borrowings to bridge the external current

account deficit and to finance the budget deficit not

only increased the external debt stock of the state,

but also increased the quantum of interest payments,

thereby contributing to the widening of the deficit in

the primary income account. In order to reduce the

debt repayment burden, it is important to ensure that

foreign borrowings are utilised effectively for income

generating and productivity enhancing ventures,

especially in the tradable sector that generates

foreign exchange earnings. At the same time, any

effort in addressing the external current account

deficit should be focused on strategies to reduce

the trade deficit by increasing the earnings from

merchandise exports, while increasing the surplus in

the services account. Further, product diversification,

vertical and horizontal integration, participation

in production sharing networks and linking with

the global value chains through component

manufacturing as well as reducing the over reliance

on certain markets as export destinations by way of

exploring new markets could be considered as vital

initiatives to maximise the return from integrating

with the rest of the world, while minimising the risk

of adverse global spillovers. Despite the changes

25

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

in the political regimes, speedy and uninterrupted

implementation of the actions outlined in the National

Export Strategy is essential in the national interest

to achieve the intended outcomes. Policy measures

aiming at promoting domestic industries that supply

intermediate goods required for key exports should

be implemented promptly to enhance the domestic

value addition in the export sector. Further, initiatives

on moving towards renewable energy sources

would also reduce the country’s reliance on fossil

fuels thereby helping to minimise the pressure on

the current account stemming from fuel imports.

Moreover, services exports are vital in cushioning

the deficit in the external current account, and

hence it is imperative to exploit their full potential.

Certain services exports, especially in the IT/BPO

sector, have the potential to become the forerunner

in bringing foreign exchange inflows to the country.

Capitalising on the high potential, the aim should

be to transform the IT/BPO sector from the current

levels of around US dollars 1 billion per year to a US

dollars 5 billion export industry in the medium term

with the necessary assistance of the Government.

Growth opportunities in the IT/BPO sectors have

expanded with the increased digitalisation of

economies worldwide which is also supported by

the novel working arrangements introduced with the

outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, Sri

Lanka should capitalise on the availability of a skilled

labour force and the state-of-the-art IT infrastructure

to promote Sri Lanka as a digital nation thereby

encouraging higher foreign exchange inflows.

Also, the IT education policy needs to be aligned

to complement the development of human capital

required to keep up with the expansion in this sector.

Moreover, the tourism sector is showing signs of

revival after the pandemic with the gradual relaxation

of travel restrictions and the success of the vaccine

drive although some new risks have emerged due

to global geopolitical tensions. Hence, to reap the

maximum benefits of the recovery in the tourism

industry, it is imperative to diversify the tourism

sector to focus on niche offerings that would attract

high spending tourists, thereby enabling access

to non traditional markets and tourists that travel

for different purposes. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka has

been heavily relying on workers’ remittances from

Middle Eastern economies to cushion the impact

of the trade deficit on the external current account.

This also increases Sri Lanka’s exposure to any

geopolitical conflicts and the growth slowdowns in

the Middle Eastern region due to oil price volatilities.

Therefore, workers’ remittances from the Middle East

can no longer be considered a sustainable source

to finance the current account deficit. Thus, there is

a need to find alternative destinations by exploring

new labour markets, especially in advanced

economies such as South Korea, Singapore, Japan

and European countries. In addition, enhancing the

skills of migrant employees is beneficial to secure

employment opportunities with higher and stable

earnings. More importantly, rerouting remittances

that are partly channelled through informal means

at present to the formal banking channel through

targeted policy measures along with the support of

all stakeholders is the need of the hour to bridge the

trade gap. In addition to the targeted measures to

address broader current account deficits, it is also

necessary to supplement them by attracting more

non debt creating inflows in the form of FDI and also

portfolio investments into the financial account of

the BOP in order to ensure greater external sector

stability and improved macroeconomic stability.

Attracting non debt creating foreign financial

inflows to strengthen the external sector

resilience has become a pressing need going

forward in order to ensure stability in the external

sector, amidst higher foreign currency debt

servicing requirements and lack of fiscal space

for debt repayment. Being a twin deficit country, Sri

Lanka has been resorting to foreign and domestic

debt to finance deficits in both the external current

account and the government budget. As a result, a

26

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

1

disproportionate increase in external debt in relation

to GDP and surging debt service payments have

been largely contributing towards the external sector

imbalances over the recent past. Moreover, with

limited access to concessional funding in line with the

transition towards a middle income country, financing

requirements have to be fulfilled through commercial

loans and sovereign debt issuances. Such efforts

are constrained by heightened uncertainties in the

global financial markets and successive sovereign

rating downgrades. Accordingly, Sri Lanka could

not raise an adequate quantum of funds in the

international capital markets during the last two

years. Amidst weak FDI inflows, foreign investments

in the stock market and the government securities

market have been considerably low over the past

two years due to weak investor sentiment owing

to the pandemic although there have been some

temporary pickups in the markets. Therefore, in the

absence of significant foreign financial inflows, the

liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market

dried up notably and foreign debt service payments

have been met at the cost of depleting foreign

reserves. Against this backdrop, it is vital to focus

on attracting non debt creating foreign financial

flows such as FDI, which are long term capital flows

and are not susceptible to immediate withdrawals

like portfolio investments rather than just resorting

to more and repeated foreign borrowings. Beyond

supporting the financing of the current account

deficit and augmenting domestic investment, FDI

fosters economic growth by generating technology

spillovers, supporting human capital development,

assisting business expansion and enhancing

international trade linkages through improved access

to foreign markets. Although FDI flows plunged

globally in 2020 and 2021 owing to the pandemic,

Sri Lanka’s FDI remained acutely low compared

to its regional peers over the past decades due to

several legal, structural and institutional deficiencies

such as rigid labour market regulations, difficulties

in obtaining utilities, complex and inconsistent tax

structures and laborious regulatory structures,

particularly related to contract enforcement, export

import documentation, business startups, obtaining

funds and property acquisition, and the lack of

well developed infrastructure facilities. Apart from

these factors, policy uncertainty, institutional and

governance weaknesses such as corruption and

coordination failures continue to pose impediments

to creating a conducive investment climate in

Sri Lanka. Therefore, in order to foster investor

confidence, Sri Lanka needs to establish a

transparent and effective policy environment by

articulating a comprehensive investment policy

and build the required human competencies and

institutional capacities to implement policy actions.

Harmonisation of investment policy with other

government development policies and strategies,

such as trade and industrial policies, as well as

inter agency coordination in implementing these

policies remain equally important. While efforts

have already been taken to rectify these concerns

by relevant authorities, it is imperative to expedite

the implementation process before global FDI flows

resume to pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore,

creating a conducive regulatory environment

through labour and land market reforms as well as

tax reforms that would simplify the tax regulations

will also complement this endeavour. Establishing

and respecting rule of law, strengthening efforts to

eradicate corruption, and ensuring transparency,

are also crucial to making Sri Lanka an attractive

investment destination. A renewed focus on

expediting policy reforms aimed at reducing

administrative deficiencies and bureaucratic

constraints will also be instrumental in attracting

and retaining a high level of FDI. Developing the

Colombo Port City and promoting the Colombo

and Hambantota ports as commodity trading hubs

could attract considerable foreign investments to the

country in the period ahead. While taking measures

to enhance FDI flows, it is essential to gradually

reduce the ISB exposure with a view to reducing

27

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

the external debt burden. Further, monetisation

of underutilised non strategic assets would also

help bring in much needed foreign exchange to

the country. Most importantly, immediate attention

should be drawn to restoring investor confidence

weakened by unwarranted fears triggered by credit

rating actions and numerous media coverage

including social media creating negative perceptions

about the country. In this regard, engaging in a

continued dialogue with existing and potential

investors, capitalising on trade and diplomatic

relations to entice investment opportunities, liaising

with regional counterparts to tap niche markets

and exploring investment opportunities to make

use of green financing options would be beneficial.

A key issue identified by many of the Green and

Sustainable Finance initiatives is the need to

develop standard definitions, i.e., a taxonomy. The

Central Bank is in the process of developing a green

finance taxonomy that will provide the framework

for investment analysis for the banking sector when

funding green projects.

There is a pressing need for all stakeholders

of the energy sector to work together to devise

a holistic plan for the energy sector that will

guarantee energy security of the economy,

while also ensuring that energy related SOBEs

serve as growth drivers of the economy that

create positive externalities. The energy sector

of Sri Lanka saw a rapid transformation in the post-

conflict era with electrification levels reaching 99

per cent and a significant progress in augmenting

the power generation infrastructure base of the

country. The Government’s recent thrust to expand

the renewable energy sector to cater to 70 per cent

of the country’s energy requirement by 2030 is a

welcome initiative as it would help substantially

improve the resilience of the energy sector,

especially in the wake of weather related volatilities

that affect hydro power generation and rising energy

commodity prices that could hinder thermal power

generation. Over the last many months, economic

activity has been significantly hampered by long

and continuous power cuts, also leading to extreme

social unrest and even political turmoil. Such

adverse developments in the form of an energy

crisis would be a significant setback to the recovery

process of the economy and its sustainability.

While several small and medium enterprises are

extremely vulnerable to such long episodes of

power cuts, several exporters, including those in

the apparel and services sector, are also likely to

lose their competitiveness, potentially resulting

in orders migrating to other competitor countries.

Even with the sharp decline in crude oil prices in

2020 followed by favourable weather conditions

throughout 2021 that enabled higher hydropower

generation, the country was not able to derive the

benefits of such price declines. At the same time, the

ongoing energy sector crisis is partly a culmination

of the persistently weak financial positions of the

key SOBEs. Their poor financial situation is further

aggravated by the upward price trends of energy

commodities and the overall scarcity of foreign

currency liquidity amidst a steady increase in

demand for energy. These developments reiterate

the importance of cost-reflective pricing for both

petroleum products and electricity tariffs, in addition

to forward looking planning and management

of such SOBEs, to create a long term energy

plan focused on assessing the growing demand

for energy and identifying sustainable means of

fulfilling such demand. The implementation of

cost reflective pricing mechanisms is essential

not only to strengthen and ensure the financial

viability of SOBEs, but also to ensure the stability

of the banking sector and the macroeconomy.

Implementation of such a mechanism can improve

efficiency, transparency and predictability, thereby

enhancing the general public’s acceptance of both

upward and downward price revisions. Hence,

such a market based mechanism can ensure that

the interests of both SOBEs and consumers are

1Introduction

In an open economy, stability in the external sector is vital as external imbalances could cause widespread spillover effects across all sectors of the economy, thereby threatening the overall macroeconomic stability. The external sector in Sri Lanka has been facing unprecedented challenges in recent years, amidst headwinds caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and adverse developments in the global economy. In this context, long term stability in the external sector, characterised by a sustainable external debt position and a manageable external current account deficit, has been identified as an important near to medium term priority in macroeconomic policymaking. Sri Lanka needs sustainable solutions to ensure long term stability in the external sector vis-a-vis short term measures.

Evolution of External Sector Related Economic Policies in Sri Lanka

At the time of gaining independence from the British, Sri Lanka was an agriculture based open economy characterised by a plantation sector and a subsistence agriculture sector with a fixed exchange rate regime. Exports were based on three main plantation crops; tea, rubber and coconut, which accounted for around 90 per cent of total exports.

External Sector Policies in the Post-Independence Era

Free Trade Policy in Early 1950s

Sri Lanka maintained a free trade policy regime in the early period of independence and the country was one of the most liberalised economies in Asia. Until the late 1950s, Sri Lanka was able to sustain the open trade policy regime with large trade surpluses supported by two commodity booms, which had led to significant build-up of foreign reserves. However, substantial trade deficits were recorded since 1957 owing to the rapid growth of import expenditure and deterioration of terms of trade.

Import Controls from Mid 1950s to Mid 1960s

Large trade deficits exerted pressure on the balance of payments (BOP) resulting in a sharp depletion of gross official reserves after 1956. In response, by establishing a Foreign Exchange Budget Committee, the Government imposed rigorous import control measures including imposition of quotas, licenses and tariffs on imports except food, petroleum and pharmaceutical imports. The development strategy of the Government was based on encouraging import substitution and domestic agricultural expansion to reduce import expenditure and achieve self sufficiency in essential commodities. By the mid 1960s, the economy was heavily regulated with protectionist measures and an overvalued fixed exchange rate was maintained. Meanwhile, export promotion strategies were also adopted to arrest the BOP issues.

BOX 2Achieving Sri Lanka’s External Sector Stability in the Medium to Long Term

Partial Liberalisation of the Economy from Late 1960s to 1970

Partial liberalisation of international trade was allowed since 1966 with partial relaxation of import restrictions accompanied by a devaluation of the currency by 20 per cent in 1967 and the introduction of the dual exchange rate system under the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate mechanism in 1968. Although foreign financing assistance was received from multilateral institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during the period, the external sector performance weakened considerably in 1960s.

Reimposition of Import Controls from 1970 to 1977

Sri Lanka experienced the most stringent trade and exchange restrictions during this period with the socialist oriented policies introduced by the new Government that came to power in 1970. All imports were brought under licensing requirements and incentives were provided to promote non-traditional exports. During this period, the economy faced global headwinds from an oil crisis, the Vietnam War and structural deficiencies in the US economy, which led the Bretton Woods System of exchange rates to collapse. With changing the value of rupee against the US dollar subsequent to the collapse of the Bretton Woods System and BOP pressures, exchange restrictions on both current and capital transactions were tightened and these rigid controls were in place until 1977.

Introduction of Open Economic Policies in 1977

The Sri Lankan economy marked a significant milestone in 1977 with the introduction of liberal economic policies with enhanced private sector participation in production and investment. As an integral part of the liberal policy regime, the dual exchange rate system was abolished by establishing a unified exchange rate. The transition from a fixed exchange rate regime to a managed float exchange rate regime, which determined the exchange rate based on market demand and supply conditions, was a radical shift in Sri Lanka’s exchange rate policy. A plethora of exchange control relaxation measures were also implemented. These policy measures included removal of restrictions on current transactions, lifting of quantitative import restrictions, rationalisation and simplification of import tariff structure, and removal of price controls and licensing requirements. Simultaneously, in view of reducing the adverse implications stemming from fiscal sector imbalances, many fiscal reforms, such as restructuring of food subsidies, privatising government enterprises and promoting private sector led growth, were introduced. Incentives were provided to encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) to export industries and export processing zones. Foreign financial flows gradually started to increase after 1977, with the relaxation of exchange restrictions. Subsequently, with the economy

29

changing its course from being primarily an agricultural economy to one driven by the services and industrial sectors, Sri Lanka entered into a number of preferential trade agreements to strengthen trade and investment linkages with its regional peers.

External Sector: Current Position and Issues

Persistently High Current Account Deficits

Sri Lanka has been experiencing persistent external current account deficits mainly driven by large deficits in the merchandise trade account and primary income account over the past few years. Although the trade in services account and secondary income account, which comprise workers’ remittances, recorded surpluses, these surpluses were not large enough to cushion the impact of merchandise trade and primary income account deficits on the current account. Lackluster performance in export earnings and increasing import expenditure led to a widening deficit in merchandise trade over the years. Although Sri Lanka was one of the first countries in the region to adopt liberal economic policies in 1977, its trade openness remains low. Trade openness, which is the total value of exports and imports in relation to the country’s GDP, was 36.4 per cent in 1977 and it nearly doubled to 72.2 per cent by 1979. However, Sri Lanka’s international trade performance has not been impressive in terms of trade openness, declining to levels that were seen during the pre-liberalisation era by 2019, where Sri Lanka's trade openness was 38.0 per cent. Workers’ remittances have also shown a declining trend since mid 2021, contributing to widening current account deficits.

Adverse Implications of the Easter Sunday Attacks and the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Current Account

Although the current account deficit narrowed significantly in 2019 and 2020 due to the notable contraction in the trade deficit driven by reduced import expenditure, the surplus in the services account was affected severely in both years by the loss of earnings from tourism due to the Easter Sunday attacks and travel restrictions imposed with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite a notable recovery since end 2020, the tourism sector has not yet reached pre pandemic levels thus far. Workers’

remittances, which declined initially during the pandemic period, started to increase rapidly since mid 2020. However, workers’ remittances received through formal channels started to decline since mid 2021, mainly due to the differences in the exchange rate prevailing between the grey market and official channels. The trade deficit that contracted during the last two years widened significantly in 2021, particularly during the second half of the year owing to a sharp increase in import expenditure, even amidst continuing import restrictions on selected imports, negating the impact of notable increase in export earnings. These adverse developments in the post pandemic period, particularly related to trade deficit, inflows to the services account and workers’ remittances, have aggravated the vulnerabilities in the already fragile external sector.

Meagre Performance in the Financial Account

Sri Lanka has not been able to attract non debt creating foreign financial flows, such as FDI up to the expected levels, even during the post war period, due to structural and policy issues related to FDI. Over the past decade, annual FDI inflows remained around US dollars 1.3 billion, on average, and around 1-2 per cent of GDP. The prevailing weak investment climate in Sri Lanka can be attributed to a range of factors including policy uncertainty, restrictive labour regulations, lack of progress in ease of doing business, inconsistencies in protection of property rights, weaknesses in maintenance of law and order, and so forth. In addition, institutional weaknesses, such as corruption, weak regulations, red tape and faltering infrastructure have resulted in Sri Lanka attracting significantly lower inflows of FDI than its peer economies.

Mounting External Debt

During the last decade, the mounting external debt and growing debt service payments were the major contributors to the external sector imbalances. With Sri Lanka accessing international financial markets to raise funds by issuing International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) since 2007, the country's external debt has been accumulating at a steady pace. However, this increased the overall cost of funding of the debt portfolio as

ISBs were often priced at relatively high interest rates compared to the development assistance finances Sri Lanka used to receive at concessional rates. Moreover, the expansion in government fiscal deficit due to the financing of large infrastructure projects with the post war economic resurgence also contributed towards this increase. Following the trend in debt accumulation, the external debt as a percentage of GDP has also gradually been on the rise over the past decade and remains around 60 per cent of GDP, on average. When comparing the external debt as a percentage of GDP with its regional peers, Sri Lanka has recorded the highest ratio after Bhutan, Maldives and Cambodia. Except for these four countries, the external debt to GDP ratio of other peer Asian countries lies well below 50 per cent of their respective GDP.

Foreign Debt Service Payments

Increasing external debt stock as well as the compositional change in Sri Lanka’s foreign debt profile from concessional borrowings to costlier non-concessional and commercial borrowings have resulted in increased foreign debt service payments. The high cost of external borrowings has expanded the deficit in the primary income account, exerting further pressure on the current account of the BOP. Total external debt service payments as a percentage of export of goods and services has increased from 13.2 per cent in 2011 to 30.0 per cent in 2021 indicating that nearly one third of Sri Lanka’s annual export earnings are consumed for debt servicing. Further, government debt servicing accounts for more than 80 per cent of the foreign debt service payments indicating that the external sector financing issues are mainly stemming from fiscal imbalances.

Declining Gross Official Reserves

The gross official reserve position of the country deteriorated to critically low levels by end 2021 due to higher foreign currency debt service payments amidst inadequate foreign exchange inflows. The low level of foreign exchange inflows in terms of export earnings repatriation, workers’ remittances and foreign capital

flows resulted in a shortage of liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market necessitating the Central Bank to supply foreign exchange to finance essential imports, which further depleted the reserve levels.

Significant Pressure on the Exchange Rate

The external sector imbalances are largely reflected by the dried up liquidity conditions in the domestic foreign exchange market, series of sovereign rating downgrades along with the precarious level of international reserves that have exerted significant depreciation pressures on the exchange rate. While the exchange rate was maintained at around Rs. 200 – 203 per US dollar during most of 2021 and until early March 2022, mainly through moral suasion by the Central Bank, a notable development of parallel markets for foreign exchange was observed. However, following the adjustment in the exchange rate in early March 2022 and subsequent market pressure, the Sri Lanka rupee depreciated sharply by 33.0 per cent against the US dollar by end March 2022. However, some stability in the exchange rate is expected with the significant tightening of the monetary policy stance in early April 2022 along with other corrective measures currently being considered to be implemented with immediate effect, which mainly include, initiating discussions with the IMF for an economic adjustment programme, suspension of external debt servicing for an interim period leading to an orderly and consensual debt restructuring process, and fiscal consolidation, along with the negotiations to obtain bridging financing.

Medium to Long Term Policies to Achieve External Sector Stability

The Central Bank took a number of short term measures in the recent past to address the external sector issues. The Central Bank issued new rules pertaining to mandatory repatriation and conversion of proceeds of exports of goods and services to Sri Lanka rupees that helped improve the liquidity conditions in the domestic foreign exchange market. Further, with the aim of building up of gross official reserves through non borrowed sources, the Central Bank instructed the licensed banks to sell to the Central Bank a portion of

foreign exchange so converted. Although this measure impacted the liquidity in the domestic forex market to a certain extent, it enabled the Central Bank to supply much needed foreign exchange to the market to partly finance the demand for essential goods imports. Initiatives were taken to encourage transferring of workers’ remittances through formal channels including the provision of incentives above the normal exchange rate for the foreign exchange remittances converted at licensed banks, reimbursement of transaction costs incurred on account of workers’ remittances, and the launch of a National Remittance Mobile Application branded as “Lanka Remit”. Further, rules were issued requiring hotel service providers registered with the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority to accept payments in respect of services rendered to non residents only in foreign exchange. Moreover, the Central Bank has also been able to secure foreign financial assistance from regional central banks by way of bilateral currency swaps. Although the short term policy measures have been effective in reviving the external sector to a certain extent, policies spanning over medium to long term are required to enhance the resilience and maintain continuous stability in the external sector. Such policies should be focused on the following key areas:

Medium Term Measures

Initiating Comprehensive Macroeconomic Reforms Consistent with an Economic Adjustment Programme Supported by the IMF

Considering the spiraling economic issues faced by the country, the Government has decided to begin negotiations with the IMF that may lead to a possible IMF funded programme aiming at macroeconomic stability. This IMF funding arrangement could be complemented with a comprehensive reform agenda in major areas, such as fiscal consolidation, strengthening financial performance of State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs), phasing out monetary financing, and improving efficiency in social safety net programmes, among others.

The Need for Ensuring External Debt Sustainability

The current focus of the Government and the Central Bank is on ensuring the sustainability of the country’s external debt in the long term to build resilience in the economy. In this context, the Government has already published Request for Proposals from interested parties for appointing Financial Advisors and Legal Consultants for managing its external debt in a sustainable manner. Such debt management process may involve a comprehensive debt restructuring plan, which would be conditional upon an agreement to an economic reform programme with the IMF. In parallel, the Government announced on 12 April 2022 that it would temporarily suspend external debt servicing for an interim period pending consensual external debt restructuring. These measures are expected to reduce high exposure to external debt and thus helping to ensure external debt sustainability.

Maintaining Healthy Levels of Gross Official Reserves

In order to maintain external sector stability, it is crucial to maintain a healthy level of gross official reserves, which is an indicator of the country’s ability to withstand external shocks as well as its ability to honour external debt service payments. Hence, increasing the country’s gross official reserves remain the most important medium term objective of the external sector. The country envisages to enhance gross official reserves to cover a minimum of 4 months of merchandise imports. While these targets remain significantly challenging, the ongoing efforts towards debt restructuring and envisaged foreign currency inflows are expected to increase gradually over the medium to long term, enabling the gradual build-up of gross official reserves. While the medium term objective of the Central Bank is to gradually increase the quantity of reserves, the composition is also expected to be improved by organic build-up of reserves through non-borrowed sources.

Strengthening Regional Cooperation

It is essential to maintain international cooperation with regional stakeholders, including regional central banks, governments, business communities, investors and multilateral agencies to build up stakeholder confidence leading to sustained external sector stability over the medium term. In this regard, the Central Bank continues to hold discussions on future collaborations with counterparts in several regional countries.

Long Term Measures to Strengthen Non-debt Creating Foreign Exchange Inflows

Promoting Merchandise and Services Exports Sectors

The National Export Strategy (NES) is instrumental in supporting both goods and services export industries to achieve higher foreign exchange earnings. The existing NES was designed and implemented with a view to transforming Sri Lanka into an export hub driven by innovation and was expected to be implemented within a 5-year horizon from 2018 - 2022. It will be important to revive the NES with some modifications to suit the more recent developments in international trade and provide much needed policy support to the exports sector and such policies should continue without interruption under any political regime. Implementation of a broad based and consistent NES is expected to create steady and sustainable growth in exports while unlocking potential export sectors to create new job opportunities and facilitating value addition through increased participation in global value chains and product sharing networks. Along with these, measures should be introduced and monitored in attracting investment to the tradable sector, especially for industries producing intermediate goods for the export sector and industries oriented mainly towards global trade.

Equal attention should be given to promoting services sector exports that have high potential and domestic value addition than traditional merchandise exports. Earnings from tourism have been the major contributor to the surplus in the services account in the recent years although being severely affected by the Easter Sunday attacks and the COVID-19 pandemic. Continuous promotion of tourism to reach its potential should be

and establishing modern investment zones for local and foreign private investors, are expected to attract considerable foreign investment to the country in the period ahead. A close coordination and monitoring mechanism to facilitate and promote such investment is necessary to build long term macroeconomic resilience.

Conclusion

The corrective measures taken by the Government and the Central Bank, including initiating negotiations with the IMF for an economic adjustment programme, commencement of an external debt restructuring process, commitment towards fiscal consolidation, alongside significant monetary policy tightening and more market based exchange rate determination, are expected to help restore confidence of stakeholders in the economy in the period ahead. It is imperative that the long neglected structural reforms are introduced in the immediate future to reduce the external current account deficit and the fiscal deficit, which remained the root cause of the recurring external sector instability for decades. Managing the twin deficits at sustainable levels is crucial to ensure long term sustainability in country’s external debt, while maintaining healthy levels of reserves to withstand economic headwinds, thereby ensuring long term stability of the external sector.

prioritised. Other services sectors, such as IT/ BPO, transportation and port services sectors, also have to be integrated into the national plan to strengthen export earnings from goods and services.

Enhancing Workers’ Remittances

With the gradual dissipation of the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of targeted policy measures, workers’ remittances have shown signs of improvement. The departures for foreign employment are rising as reflected by the increase in migrant workers registering with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE). Further, narrowing of the gap between the official exchange rate and the grey market rate is also expected to help attract higher foreign remittances formally. Active stakeholder engagement to promote foreign employment, diversifying foreign employment market and upskilling of migrant employees are expected to secure more foreign employment opportunities with higher earnings, thereby increasing the contribution of workers’ remittances to cushion the impact of the widening trade deficit.

Attracting FDI

To sustain a healthy momentum of non debt creating foreign financial flows, such as FDI over the medium term, there is a dire need to maintain policy consistency, improve doing business conditions, strengthening institutions, and expediting the approval and the implementation processes to facilitate FDI.

of the costs of any price rises and the benefits of

any associated price declines. In this regard, strong

collaborative efforts are also required not only

between the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC)

and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) but also

with other stakeholders such as the Public Utilities

Commission of Sri Lanka, Sustainable Energy

Authority, Independent Power Producers and other

private and public stakeholders to devise not only

a suitable pricing mechanism but also sustainable

long term strategies with due consideration to

all aspects of the energy sector. Going forward,

with the growing demand for energy stemming

from the development of the Colombo Port City,

industrial zones, and other infrastructure projects,

it is essential that appropriate plans are devised

to ensure the provision of reliable, adequate, and

affordable energy utilities to improve the country’s

productivity and competitiveness.

Measures need to be taken expeditiously

to accelerate the expected FDI inflows into

the Colombo Port City in order to optimise

its potential benefits to the economy. The

Colombo Port City Economic Commission, which

was established recently via a Parliamentary Act,

enables the facilitation of FDI inflows to the country

through the issuance or granting of registrations,

licenses, and authorisations to engage in business,

facilitating and exercising overall regulatory

supervision, and leasing of Government’s

marketable land situated within the area of the

Colombo Port City. Further, it was established as

sole point of contact to investors and is empowered

to improve the ease of doing business through

international financial and business centres and

enable expeditious resolution of any commercial

channelled into the initial stages, the contribution

of the Colombo Port City to the domestic economy

as the main conduit of integration to the global

economy is vital, given the shortfall in major

growth drivers at present. Nevertheless, FDI to the

Colombo Port City remain modest as the timing of

the completion of the initial stages of the project

was not perfect due to the prevailing international

investor sentiments, driven by the concerns amidst

the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainties caused

by the geopolitical tensions along with heightened

domestic economic hardship. However, as the

Colombo Port City has the proximity advantage

to major cities in South Asia and South East Asia,

it is expected to facilitate enhancing FDI into the

country over the medium term, provided that

aggressive investor facilitation and promotions

are initiated immediately. Further, easing of the

long rooted structural bottlenecks for investments

and businesses is also vital to entice investors’

preference towards Sri Lanka, though the Colombo

Port City is governed by specific legislation

and regulatory arrangements. Also, a robust

and customised strategy to approach potential

investors to promote investments would have to

be considered. Moreover, as a Financial City is

proposed to be established within the Colombo Port

City as the financial services hub, it is important to

capture these economic activities into the country’s

GDP to fully reflect the contribution of the Colombo

Port City to the economy. The development of the

Colombo Port City as a financial centre is expected

to enhance inflows to the services account through

exports of financial services, IT/BPO services,

etc. Also, as the Colombo Port City is strategically

located in a geopolitically important position that

draws strategic interest from global investors in

a competitive environment, any foreign interest

needs to be dealt with in line with Sri Lanka's non

aligned foreign policy, with a view to strengthening

foreign relationships with regional and global

counterparts. Also, as the legislative structure

under which the Colombo Port City is governed

provides a highly conducive business environment

for foreign investors, policies would have to be

carefully formulated to ensure that it would not

disintegrate from the main economy. Given the

massive initial investment made in the Colombo

Port City and the considerable tax benefits that

were extended to newly established enterprises

during the gestation period, the success of the

whole project will depend on the amount of revenue

collected from the ventures in terms of taxes and

other means and using the same for the benefit of

the economy. The skill premium required by the

more advanced enterprises to be established in the

Colombo Port City would be reflected in the wage

premium offered by such enterprises, triggering

a migration of skilled labour to the Colombo Port

City from the rest of Sri Lanka. Two major effects

could be expected when a modern sector is carved

out within an economy. Firstly, there would be

an acceleration of structural transformation, as

the wage premium on offer could encourage the

acquisition of skills in high demand, leading to

an overall improvement in labour productivity.

Secondly, it could lead to deviations in income

distribution due to the attractive wage premiums

on offer in the modern sector. Nevertheless, the

wage premium gap would be an incentive for

workers to develop specialised skills to match the

modern technology and requirements in a dynamic

labour market. At the same time, the education

system would have to be transformed to cater to

the demand for skilled workers in the Colombo

Port City and efforts to produce more graduates

in STEM (science, technology, engineering and

maths) subjects must be reinforced. This project

is also expected to boost the tourism industry and

it would require exploring ways to attract affluent

tourists given the potential to promote the Colombo

Port City as a luxury destination. The activities and

accommodation available in the Colombo Port

City need to target a niche market of tourists and

carry a premium price. Further, a resident guest

visa programme and the newly proposed Golden

Paradise residential visa programme could be

promoted overseas targeting to attract residential

visa holders for the Colombo Port City. The income

from services and inflows of FDI to the Colombo

Port City are expected to provide much needed

non debt creating financial flows to the BOP over

the medium term and thereby bolster the policy

efforts aimed at the recovery of Sri Lanka’s external

sector.

Persistently low revenue mobilisation over

the years remains the key underlying reason

for the continued vulnerabilities in the fiscal

sector and the macroeconomic imbalances,

warranting the need for adopting sustainable

revenue generation measures. Although

government expenditure in Sri Lanka remains at

a moderate level compared to the regional peers,

government revenue collection has been well below

the average revenue collection of peer economies

and has been continuously declining over the

past two decades. In 2021, government revenue

as a percentage of GDP was only 8.7 per cent in

Sri Lanka, whereas the same for emerging and

middle income countries stood at 26 per cent of

GDP. The low tax regime introduced in late 2019

coupled with the economic downturn caused by the

COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a sharp reduction

in government revenue in the past two years.

Moreover, tax elasticity and tax buoyancy of Sri

Lanka are estimated to be less than unity indicating

that the expansion in tax revenue mobilisation is

weaker than the expansion in economic activity.2

In addition, Sri Lanka’s tax system has turned

out to be a regressive system with over 75 per

cent of tax revenue being collected by means of

indirect taxes, posing a disproportionately high tax

burden on low income households. The multitude

Tax buoyancy reflects the total response of tax revenue to chang-es in GDP, which includes the impact of discretionary policy adjustments such as increase in tax rates and expansion in the tax base.

of tax exemptions and tax holidays which have not

necessarily translated into higher economic activity,

ad hoc tax rate reductions and upward revisions in

tax free thresholds and tax brackets, slow expansion

in the tax base, lack of progressive taxes, low tax

compliance, tax evasion and tax avoidance as well

as weak tax administration are the major factors

that have led to low tax revenue mobilisation

in Sri Lanka. Frequent tax changes have also

negatively impacted tax compliance, hindering the

consistency of the tax system, while increasing the

cost of tax administration. Persistently low revenue

mobilisation has posed serious repercussions on the

macroeconomy, with elevated budget deficits and

higher financing requirements from both foreign and

domestic sources, thereby resulting in burgeoning

public debt, vulnerabilities in the domestic financial

system, inflationary pressures, BOP issues and

depreciation pressures on the exchange rate.

Low revenue mobilisation also impedes long term

economic growth by restricting the Government’s

capacity to make public investments in both physical

and social infrastructure. These deep-rooted

issues emphasise the importance of expediting

the implementation of consistent and persistent

revenue based fiscal consolidation that would

eventually render long run macroeconomic stability

and sustainable growth. In this regard, raising tax

rates for both direct and indirect taxes, broadening

the tax base by lowering tax free thresholds,

reducing tax exemptions and eliminating long tax

holidays could enhance government revenue in the

short term. Any tax concessions should be granted

by giving due consideration to the effectiveness of

such policies in improving fiscal balances in the long

term through the achievement of economic growth

and overall macroeconomic objectives. Such

concessions should be short time bound and linked

to measurable performance outcomes in the specific

industry with a view to gradually supporting the

envisaged development. Further, making realistic

revenue forecasting and revenue targets based

35

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

on past experiences and economic conditions is

extremely important to correct recurring deviations

in revenue targets and expenditure overruns

resulting in continuous expansion in the budget

deficit. In addition, maintaining a consistent and

simple tax structure is imperative to encourage tax

compliance and thereby improve revenue collection.

Meanwhile, strengthening tax administration is also

critical in enhancing government revenue, as the

sustainability of enhanced tax collection usually

coincides with reforms in tax administration. Given

the interlinked tax administration activities, a holistic

approach pursuing multiple reform strategies at

numerous tax administrative layers could improve

the capacity and efficiency of the tax administration,

while reducing tax evasion. Thus, strict enforcement

of rules related to registration and filing,

strengthening audits and verification measures

through better coordination with financial institutions,

upgrading information technology systems for

greater institutional coordination, and simplifying

the procedures for tax filing, tax payments and

reporting are vital for improving tax administration.

Moreover, attention should also be paid towards

improving the management, governance, and

human resources of tax administration agencies by

enriching the technical skills of the staff, monitoring

the performance of such agencies, implementing

prudent strategic plans, and empowering revenue

collecting entities by strengthening tax legislation.

Since large taxpayers make a higher contribution to

government tax revenue collection, scaling up of tax

administration efforts targeted at large taxpayers

is also vital to ensure timely filing and payment of

taxes. Moreover, a high level of political will and

commitment with a strong and deep social dialogue

is also key to enhancing the effectiveness of these

reforms. Efficacy and efficiency of government

spending and transparency of government finances

are also necessary to encourage tax payments, in

order to promote a culture of higher tax compliance.

Achievement of medium term fiscal targets

of the Government is highly conditional on

consistent, well-coordinated and evidence

based policymaking. Historical evidence pinpoints

to notable deviations in successive governments’

fiscal operations in comparison to budgetary

estimates and medium term fiscal rules, with revenue

mobilisation often falling short of the targets and

government expenditure exceeding the estimates in

consecutive years. Implementation of ad hoc policy

measures that are inconsistent with the overall fiscal

and macroeconomic objectives remains one of the

key reasons for such undue deviations. Most of

these unplanned policies have direct or indirect fiscal

implications on revenue and expenditure fronts, and

the means of deficit financing. Consequently, ad hoc

government policies driven by socially and politically

populist short term motives could have intertemporal

effects on the budget, creating long term spending

commitments for the Government that could be

detrimental towards achieving fiscal objectives and

the overall welfare of the citizens. For instance,

managing and rationalising recurrent expenditure is

a challenging task amidst large scale recruitments

to the public sector, without considering the cadre

requirements and not linking wage increments to

productivity improvements, as well as the provision

of allowances/ subsidies that are difficult to be

withdrawn in future without causing social unrest.

Extemporary policymaking also leads to fiscal

indiscipline, lack of transparency and accountability,

thus resulting in an uncertain business environment.

In addition, the imposition of ad hoc retrospective

taxes to meet short term revenue shortfalls of the

Government could create inconsistency in the tax

system, uncertainties for businesses, and erode

both local and foreign investor confidence, along

with the increased cost of taxation being ultimately

passed onto consumers causing hardship for the

public. Further, government policies implemented

for the betterment of one sector may have spillover

effects on the other sectors and in turn, have

36

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

1

indirect budgetary implications. Hence, evidence

based and well coordinated policymaking with a

holistic view is of paramount importance to minimise

unforeseen implications on fiscal performance and

discipline. Moreover, it is crucial to educate the

general public that short term untargeted handouts

and fiscal indiscipline often result in long term fiscal

imbalances eventually affecting macroeconomic

stability and sustainable growth while creating a

higher tax burden on future generations. Creating

such awareness is vital to transforming the mindset

of the general public to assess the performance

of the governments based on their effectiveness

in achieving long term macroeconomic objectives.

Such a transformation in the mindset of the public

would encourage the authorities to refocus their

priorities towards long run development objectives

and welfare maximising policies instead of

implementing myopic and populist policies in an ad

hoc manner.

The sharp rise in central government debt

driven by weakened fiscal sector performance

over the past several decades continues to remain

a key issue on the fiscal front, raising concerns

for investors, creditors, and rating agencies.

Persistent structural budget deficits, expenditure

overruns, continued government revenue slippages,

rising gross financing needs and excessive borrowings

by consecutive Governments have culminated in

substantially high public debt levels. Moreover,

sluggish economic growth recorded in recent years

and the unprecedented economic setback during

the pandemic have further aggravated the country’s

debt issue, while deteriorating the key fiscal ratios.

Posing many macroeconomic challenges, the debt

stock increased by two folds every five to six years

in nominal terms in the past, reaching the second

historically highest debt to GDP ratio of 104.6 per cent

by end 2021. A high level of public debt exacerbates

the economy’s vulnerability to macroeconomic

shocks. Growing public debt also restrains room

for adopting countercyclical fiscal policy measures,

creates spillover effects on the private sector through

increased risk premia and cost of borrowings, which

are linked to lower sovereign credit rating. This could

severely limit economic recovery and may result

in further economic contraction. Thus, aggressive

fiscal consolidation is needed to reduce the debt

burden and stabilise the debt at manageable levels

even amidst periods of subpar economic growth. In

addition, the high debt burden could adversely affect

the country’s long run economic growth, especially

by crowding out private investment and reducing

the capacity for public investment towards needy

sectors, such as health, education, and infrastructure,

to enhance productivity over the long term. At the

same time, higher debt servicing costs associated

with high debt levels often pose challenges to the

effectiveness of monetary policy, especially when

the fiscal deficit is excessively monetised by the

monetary authority. Further, high debt levels increase

the possibility of future distortionary taxes and

uncertainties and create financial system instabilities.

The public debt burden in Sri Lanka has amplified

the external sector vulnerabilities, especially due to

the higher share of foreign debt and unfavourable

maturity structure, with the bunching of maturing

foreign debt service obligations. This high public

debt trajectory of Sri Lanka was led by the weak

adherence to fiscal consolidation targets amidst the

formation of over-optimistic revenue targets and poor

revenue mobilisation, recurring primary deficits, lower

than expected economic growth, non-availability

of concessional inflows, and foreign borrowings

which have not been matched with productive

projects that generate foreign currency earnings.

Gradual improvement in government finances is

essential to phaseout additional borrowings to meet

interest obligations, both in terms of domestic and

foreign debt, to ease debt accumulation. Therefore,

expeditious actions are crucial to preserve debt

sustainability, particularly through committed fiscal

discipline and rigorous fiscal consolidation efforts

37

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

to generate a substantial surplus in the primary

balance. Credible commitment to adhere to fiscal

rules, i.e., the long lasting constraints imposed

on fiscal policy by imposing numerical limits on

budgetary aggregates, that are specified in the Fiscal

Management (Responsibility) Act No. 3 of 2003 is

imperative to ensure sustainable fiscal consolidation,

and thereby curbing the pressures for overspending,

and ensuring fiscal transparency and accountability.

Fiscal discipline can be further strengthened by

implementing binding fiscal rules, instead of voluntary

and non binding fiscal rules. Also, efforts to replenish

reserves and build reserves through foreign currency

receipts or outflow management need to be pursued,

irrespective of short term difficulties to be faced in

relation to real economic activity. The implementation

of overdue economic reforms with regard to SOBEs

such as the introduction of the cost reflective pricing

mechanisms and establishment of an efficient

governance structure is also essential as persistent

losses of such inefficient institutions are more likely

to be eventually converted into the state’s contingent

liabilities. In addition, the promotion of long term

economic growth is also vital to essentially reduce

the debt-to-GDP ratio, while structural reforms

are crucial to eliminating obstacles to sustainable

economic growth. Considering the limited fiscal

space, the Government should streamline the

foreign funded projects that are in the pipeline taking

economic priorities into account, while devoting much

attention to high economic rates of return ensuring

transparent and efficient use of funds, which reduces

the future accumulation of debt stock of the Central

Government. Further, seeking concessional financing

could also help the Government to meet its debt

sustainability targets and strengthen macroeconomic

fundamentals. For example, resorting to green/

blue financing options for implementing sustainable

infrastructure projects could involve more favourable

conditions for borrowing, such as relatively low

interest rates and longer repayment periods.

As the country grapples with the setbacks

caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the need

for improving public sector service delivery,

in terms of quality and efficiency, has become

more crucial than ever before in the process

of economic recovery. The public sector has

been an integral part of Sri Lanka’s development

path by delivering much needed public goods and

services, ensuring inclusive and equitable access

to infrastructure, and creating a conducive business

environment with the aim of fostering private sector

investments and growth. The role played by certain

subsectors in the public sector in combating the

spread of COVID-19 and mitigating socioeconomic

hardships has reinstated its eminence, particularly

in the recent past. Since the economy is gradually

adjusting to a ‘new normal’ amidst the pandemic

and regaining growth momentum, efficient

resource allocation in the public sector and

minimising bureaucratic red tapes related to public

administration and business facilitation are vital

to assist pandemic affected individuals as well as

the business fraternity, including local and foreign

investors. However, growing inefficiencies in the

public sector and the resultant fiscal burden remain

longstanding concerns in policy circles, since the

public sector is utilising a considerable fraction of

financial and labour resources, which otherwise

could have been available for efficient use by the

private sector. Meanwhile, the pandemic has further

exposed the existing weaknesses and rigidities

in the public sector service delivery, creating new

challenges and opportunities to improve government

services. Although ‘work from home’ arrangements

were widely adopted during the pandemic, the

performance of the public sector under these new

arrangements was not comparable with that of the

private sector that successfully institutionalised these

new norms. Limitations in the physical infrastructure

and automated systems as well as limited adaptability

of the public sector labour force, weak monitoring

mechanism and stringent working arrangements

1Fiscal Policies during the Pandemic

Fiscal policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic curbed the scarring effects on economies across the world facilitating post pandemic recovery, albeit with a notable bearing on public finances, and in turn resulting in fiscal stress in these countries. The swift fiscal measures deployed in response to the unanticipated and unprecedented economic headwinds were disparate in scale, type, and coverage and were dependent on the specific structural, inherent and fiscal leeway of each economy. Advance markets and large emerging markets were in relatively better positions with ample fiscal space to accommodate such fiscal stimuli, compared to small emerging markets and developing economies. Direct budgetary measures such as increased spending on health, provision of unemployment benefits and other reliefs, tax concessions and tax deferments, liquidity support, equity injections, and indirect actions including provision of guarantees for deferred debt repayments were among common fiscal policy measures implemented by numerous countries. The steady stream of fiscal stimuli via deficit spending, and lingering effects of the pandemic together with the slowdown in economic growth have put pressure on fiscal operations of most economies, thereby threatening macroeconomic stability in respective countries.

The outbreak of the pandemic and related uncertainties have severely affected Sri Lanka, prominently the fiscal sector, as reported in many other lower middle-income and market access countries. Despite insufficient fiscal space to undertake hefty fiscal intervention, the Sri Lankan Government also committed to providing a number of fiscal stimuli to address pressing priorities since the onset of the pandemic. With increased expenses for healthcare and pandemic control measures as well as financial and in-kind transfers to vulnerable groups, the Government spent at least Rs. 117.5 billion and Rs. 165.6 billion as pandemic related expenses for 2020 and 2021, respectively. The Government instituted a low tax regime to boost the sluggish economic activity since the latter part of 2019 and this low tax environment was upheld during the pandemic period. Several tax reliefs for certain essential imports such as medicines were also granted during this period. Consequently, government revenue dwindled sharply during the pandemic period owing to modest tax rates, and diminished tax base due to the increases in tax free thresholds as well as subpar economic growth. Accordingly, fiscal deficit in 2020 and 2021 increased to 11.1 per cent and 12.2 per cent of the GDP, respectively. Meanwhile, as per the Fiscal Monitor Database of Fiscal Policy Responses to COVID-19 Pandemic – October 2021, the cumulative value of additional spending and foregone revenue by the Sri Lankan Government in relation to the pandemic was around 1.1 per cent of the GDP, which

BOX 3Fiscal Consolidation: Path to Macro Fiscal Stability

is low in comparison to several regional peers, such as India (4.1 per cent), Pakistan (2.0 per cent), Bangladesh (2.3 per cent), and Maldives (8.0 per cent). In addition, with limited fiscal space to manoeuvre, pandemic affected individuals and businesses in Sri Lanka were mainly supported by accommodative monetary policy. Moreover, reduced foreign inflows amidst the pandemic and substantial debt service payments added further stress on the fiscal and external sectors. With limited avenues for new foreign financing sources, liquidity constraints in the international capital markets as well as sovereign rating downgrades of Sri Lanka, the Government was compelled to resort to higher domestic borrowings, especially through the Central Bank and the banking sector, to meet the government financing gaps. Such fiscal imbalances led to the government debt reaching 100.6 per cent and 104.6 per cent of GDP by end 2020 and end 2021, respectively.

Nevertheless, the current weak fiscal position and the resultant macroeconomic issues in Sri Lanka are not entirely due to the pandemic situation, but rather a reflection of longstanding and unresolved issues in the fiscal sector. For several decades, Sri Lanka has been plagued by persistent fiscal deficits, compelling the Government to continually borrow from both domestic and foreign markets and accumulate public debt. As a result, a large fraction of government revenue and foreign currency inflows to the country are required to be channelled for debt service payments, permitting little leeway for productive investments. Since 1994, revenue and grants have not been sufficient to meet at least recurrent expenditure of the Government, necessitating government borrowings to cover recurrent expenses that generally do not contribute to future growth and

the country’s debt repayment potential. Moreover, as depicted in Figure B 3.1, revenue and grants in 2020 and 2021 were well below the rigid expenses that include salaries, pension, and interest payments, amplifying the severity of the issue. The unprecedented large tax reductions announced in end 2019 aggravated the issue of low revenue mobilisation of the Government, compelling monetary financing of the budget deficit during 2020 and 2021.

The Medium Term Macro-Fiscal Framework which is unveiled along with the Budget Speech outlining the Government’s targets to reduce the overall budget deficit and debt levels to a sustainable level over the past several years has never materialised, as reflected in the historical trend of actual data. Over ambitious targets for government revenue in the Budget and planning of annual expenditure in line with the overestimated revenue have always resulted in a wider than expected budget deficit. Meanwhile, the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, No. 3 of 2003 (FMRA) was enacted to ensure responsible fiscal management, prudent debt management and public scrutiny over fiscal affairs via

implementing ‘fiscal rules’ that are, however, not binding rules. These fiscal rules pertaining to fiscal deficit, public debt and contingent liabilities of the Government as stipulated in the FMRA have been subsequently amended as given in Table B 3.1. Successive Governments constantly have not met the fiscal deficit rule, while fiscal rules in relation to public debt reduction and limiting of contingent liabilities have not been attained at specified milestones. Instead, the FMRA has been amended several times, extending the time targets along with several approvals for supplementary budgets. A strong commitment to ensure prudent fiscal management has not been evident as against the proposed path of fiscal consolidation.

The Impact of Weak Fiscal Performance on Price Stability and Financial System Stability

According to Sargent and Wallace (1981), amidst fiscal dominance, the central banks are compelled to generate seigniorage revenues to ensure the solvency of governments, when fiscal operations are fixed to a given higher fiscal deficit path. Blanchard (2004) also asserts that inflation targeting only through monetary policy may not be successful in a high debt environment. The monetary authority’s attempt to raise the real interest rate with the aim of maintaining inflation at a targeted rate may aggravate debt levels through increased borrowing costs, if the fiscal authority is disinclined for fiscal consolidation. Moreover, rising debt levels could intensify sovereign default risk and exert exchange rate depreciation pressure, and thereby result in higher inflation instead of lower inflation. Therefore, Blanchard (2004) emphasises that in a high debt environment, inflation should be managed through fiscal policy by attempting to reduce fiscal deficits, and thereby government debt levels, instead of only using monetary policy to combat inflation. Meanwhile, some academics have argued that inflation and financial repression1

1 Financial repression is used to lower the cost of borrowing for the Government by way of explicit or implicit caps on interest rates, direct lending to the Government by captive domestic sources such as pension and provident funds, regulation of cross-border capital movements, and a strong connection between the Government and banks.

sector, creating greater uncertainties, reducing investor confidence, and aggravating vulnerabilities in the financial system, thereby hindering high and sustained economic growth. Therefore, at this critical juncture, the objective of attaining macroeconomic stability by resolving the macroeconomic imbalances supersedes the objective of achieving near term higher growth. Contrary to the traditional Keynesian view, recent studies have also indicated the possibility of offsetting contractionary effects of fiscal consolidation, when the fiscal consolidation is large and perceived to be credible by the public, especially when public debt levels are high (Giavazzi & Pagano, 1990). On one hand, private consumption could increase if households perceive there is a permanent reduction in the government borrowing requirement when the Government is committed to achieving fiscal consolidation. Such a reduction in government borrowings implies lower taxes in future and thus, a higher lifetime income for the households, encouraging them to increase their consumption from the current period. On the other hand, a reduction in government borrowing requirements will reduce inflation risk premia and default risk premia associated with public debt issuances due to lower inflation expectations and fewer economic uncertainties. This will lead to a fall in real interest rates and promote more productive private investment. As such, given the serious macroeconomic imbalances emanating from weak fiscal conditions, well-planned fiscal consolidation measures are more likely to be beneficial for the Sri Lankan economy, particularly to ensure macroeconomic stability and growth in the medium to long term. However, it is crucial that Sri Lanka implements the optimal combination of consolidation strategies to minimise possible contractionary effects in the short term and thereby avert fiscal austerity being a ‘self-defeating’ strategy.

At the same time, fiscal consolidation may have disproportionate effects on different economic segments resulting in widening inequalities. Fiscal austerity could worsen the prevailing inequalities that have been aggravated by the COVID-19. Therefore, consolidation strategies should be implemented with due consideration of not only output effects but also of possible consequences of austerity measures on social divide.

Way Forward

Fiscal conditions in Sri Lanka left much to be desired even prior to the onset of the pandemic, and the pandemic has compounded the pre-existing maladies of the fiscal sector. Hence, fiscal consolidation remains the utmost priority to ensure stability and long term sustainable growth. Whilst economic recovery is underway, fiscal consolidation packages should be designed in a ‘growth-friendly’ manner by using

are possible solutions to cope with a surge in public debt (Reinhart & Sbrancia, 2011). However, long term financial repression could be detrimental to financial system stability as it creates tight liquidity conditions for banks and deteriorates banks’ balance sheets, especially when the Government is on a borrowing spree from domestic banks. On the other hand, allowing inflation to rise in the economy to increase nominal GDP and thereby improving the budget balance and debt to GDP ratio could be counterproductive, especially when market participants internalise higher inflation expectations in government securities yield rates, which in turn raise borrowing costs for the Government.

At present, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka conducts monetary policy under the Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) framework with the aim of maintaining inflation at low and stable levels in line with the Bank’s mandate for economic and price stability. Persistent fiscal deficit, high government debt levels, and the heavy reliance of the Government on the Central Bank for deficit financing in the recent times, however, have undermined the effective conduct of monetary policy while threatening the financial system stability. Although supply-side disruptions have stemmed from the acceleration in inflation during the latter part of 2021, breaching the upper bound of the county’s inflation target, demand fuelled mainly by increased credit to the Government by the banking sector has also been seen as a cause for the uptick in inflation. The economic history of Sri Lanka suggests that high inflation episodes in the country coincide with fiscal imbalances. Hence, in order to ensure long term price stability, fiscal consolidation remains to be a key condition.

Fiscal Consolidation Amidst an Economic Downturn

Drawing lessons from the rest of the world, alongside a tightened monetary policy stance, fiscal consolidation should be carefully designed and implemented without depressing the demand too much to circumvent scarring effects on the economy due to its fragile state. The standard Keynesian proposition suggests that fiscal consolidation, also called fiscal austerity, has a contractionary effect on economic activity in the short run. Accordingly, as a result of attempts for fiscal consolidation, a country’s fiscal performance may even deteriorate further due to lower revenue collection and lower nominal GDP following the slowdown in economic growth. Hence, as the economic growth of the country has already been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, fiscal consolidation during the pandemic period itself may be a greater concern for policymakers. However, persistent weak fiscal conditions have instigated a myriad of macroeconomic imbalances in the Sri Lankan economy, such as high inflation, weak currency and tight liquidity conditions of the banking

fiscal instruments that have small fiscal multipliers2 in order to ensure that the policy package is generating required fiscal effects with the lowest economic costs. To this end, a clear understanding of the fiscal policy transmission mechanism and the size of multipliers of different fiscal instruments, such as the disaggregated level fiscal multipliers related to different revenue and expenditure components, are required to design a consolidation package that has benign effects on output and inequalities.

Empirical evidence related to other countries suggest that expenditure based fiscal consolidation is less likely to be contractionary, as opposed to revenue based consolidation (Alesina, Favero, & Giavazzi, 2019). However, given the low tax revenue to GDP ratio, Sri Lanka still has space for manoeuvring fiscal consolidation through revenue policies with minimal disruptions on output. Successful revenue based fiscal consolidation measures in other countries, such as in Brazil, Canada, Finland, New Zealand, and South Africa, have focused on broadening the tax base and introducing reforms to simplify tax administration (Okwuokei, 2014). Since raising indirect tax rates such as Value Added Tax (VAT) could disproportionately affect consumption of low income households during these hard times, widening the VAT base (increasing the number of VAT paying businesses) would be the appropriate option to augment government revenue while minimising output and distributional effects. In this regard, the VAT free threshold could be revised downwards to the levels that prevailed prior to the last VAT threshold adjustment.3 Meanwhile, considering the modest impact on economic growth, taxes on capital income could be raised at the personal level.

Given the relatively sticky wage structures and rigid employment contracts in Sri Lanka, Advance Personal Income Tax (APIT)/ personal income tax rates could be raised to a level comparable to the country’s regional peers while adjusting tax free thresholds and tax brackets to the levels that prevailed prior to the last income tax revision, without causing notable impact on firms’ costs and labour input. More importantly, a range of administration and enforcement reforms is key to enhancing government revenue in the medium to long term by curbing tax evasion and corruption.

Past experiences of other countries suggest that fiscal austerity through expenditure reduction is more successful since expenditure cuts reflect greater commitment of the Government and efficiency gains (Price, 2010). Although a reduction in wages and transfers are proven to be more effective in fiscal consolidation in other countries, such a move will not be an easy feat in the Sri Lankan context given the associated political cost and stringent labour market conditions. Hence, at least, new government recruitments and major public wage revisions should be considered with caution along with better targeting of subsidies. On the other hand, the reduction in capital expenditure and expenditure on health and education could create more contractionary effects both in the short and long term, especially due to the country’s deficiencies in physical and soft infrastructure. Therefore, fiscal consolidation through sizeable capital expenditure cuts should be achieved through ‘value for money’ strategies, instead of across the board expense cuts. In this regard, the Central Government as well as local government authorities should streamline capital expenditure by selecting infrastructure projects that generate the highest economic value and future growth potential. Moreover, streamlining and digitalising

work processes, and trimming unproductive recurrent expenses are essential for efficiency gains and reducing the pressure on government expenditure.

Fiscal consolidation coupled with growth-promoting investments and long overdue structural reforms would be a welcome move in this dire economic situation to address the challenges and capitalise the opportunities presented by the pandemic. Since the debt burden of inefficient, loss-making State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs) translates into contingent liabilities of the Government, reforms related to SOBEs should be expeditiously implemented in tandem with fiscal austerity. Cost-reflective pricing mechanisms, institutional restructuring for efficiency gains, and market-oriented product and service delivery are several overdue reforms related to SOBEs. In addition, legislative and administrative reforms are required to monitor the progress of fiscal consolidation, strengthen public scrutiny over the consolidation process, and ensure accountability of the policymakers and government officials for meeting austerity targets. It may be noted that the continuous reliance of major SOBEs on the two state banks, and eventually on central bank financing, has created numerous challenges to price stability. Hence, SOBEs should be held accountable for their operations and such entities should not pass their debt burden on commercial banks and the Central Bank.

The Sri Lankan economy has reached a critical juncture where fiscal consolidation is imperative and any further delay in implementing the same effectively would be economically and politically very costly. However, the Government’s strong commitment to adhere to fiscal rules and the fiscal consolidation path is paramount for the actual realisation of desired outcome. Major impediments such as the lack of broad political consensus, lacklustre approach of authorities and resultant ‘stop-go’, short term and ad hoc policies should be wiped out to contain the derailment of the fiscal consolidation process. At the same time, as success and continuation of fiscal consolidation hinges on the support of the general public, creating awareness among the general public on the repercussions of the ‘subsidy mindset’ is of high significance to transform the voter-base to be more fiscally prudent, and in turn deter policymakers pursuing fiscal profligacy.

and procedures remain hindrances to uninterrupted

operations and smooth service delivery since the

onset of the pandemic, causing severe hardships to

the public. According to the Census of Public and

Semi Government Sector Employment - 2016 report

of the Department of Census and Statistics, 33.2

per cent of the public sector employees are unable

to use a computer, while 30.4 per cent were not

using a computer for official purposes, indicating the

skill gap of the public sector labour force deterring

the shift towards a technology intensive working

environment. However, experiences gained during

the pandemic also reveal that most government

services can be efficiently delivered using a fraction

of the existing labour force by reskilling and upskilling

them, and by introducing simple and people friendly

automated systems and virtual platforms. Going

forward, the public sector of Sri Lanka needs

to embrace new technologies to cater to the

dynamic needs and expectations of the population

by building better customer relations, improved

institutional coordination and data management,

and advanced evidence based policymaking.

Legislative and procedural amendments and

flexible working arrangements should also be

implemented in tandem with digitalisation to

ensure uninterrupted service delivery during the

pandemic or any other disruptions such as natural

disasters. The effectiveness of the service delivery

depends not only on technological enhancements,

but also on human capital, regulations, and

enforcement policies. Sri Lanka, which ranked at

the 51st percentile in the Government Effectiveness

Index – 2020, could derive policy prescriptions on

the public sector effectiveness from countries like

Singapore, which was ranked at the top of the same

index. The emphasis on meritocracy in recruitments

salaries, and continuous training have equipped

the Singapore bureaucracy with highly competent

personnel for efficacious policy implementation.

In addition, a strong legislative framework against

corruption coupled with adequate personnel and

funding for the strict enforcement of anti-corruption

measures have enabled Singapore to successfully

combat corruption and maintain a high level of

efficiency in the public sector. Moreover, public sector

recruitments that are in line with the administrative

and macroeconomic requirements, target oriented

approaches in budgeting, resource reallocation

from excessive sectors to needy sectors, planned

and targeted reskilling and upskilling of labour, and

creating administrative flexibility for the workers

to move across different sectors within the public

sector are essential to ensure productive efficiency

in the Sri Lankan public sector.

The overreliance of the public sector on the

banking system, including the Central Bank to

source financial resources, needs to be scaled

down by exploring alternative sources of

financing and implementing long due structural

reforms enabling improvements to the financial

strength of the banking system. Apart from the

revenue earned by the public sector, bank financing

has been one of the key sources of financing for

both the Government and SOBEs. In recent years,

particularly since the onset of the pandemic, the

public sector, predominantly the Government, has

been increasingly relying on the banking system to

meet its financing requirements, thereby exerting

tremendous pressure on the banking sector,

especially the state banks, and domestic price

stability. The loss of access to international capital

markets amidst the rise in debt and sovereign

credit rating downgrades has aggravated the

funding constraints of the Government, while

SOBEs have been compelled to borrow from the

banking sector due to the inadequate adjustment

of administratively determined prices and tariffs of

their products, forcing them to continuously borrow

for working capital purposes. Such excessive

reliance of the public sector on bank financing

has put pressure on the domestic banking sector

and the overall domestic financial market, raising

financial system stability concerns as well. Further,

continued financing of the public sector without a

commensurate improvement in productivity and

efficiency, could in turn pose even higher inflationary

pressures, while increasingly becoming a burden on

the Government and taxpayers. Also, this would

lead to the crowding out of productivity bound

private sector investment, which could have adverse

implications on the long term growth potential of the

economy. The Government’s cashflows have been

severely affected by tax relaxations and exemptions

as well as limitations associated with tax collection.

Similarly, large overdue payments to some SOBEs,

particularly from other government entities and other

SOBEs, have also impacted cashflows forcing them

to obtain loans and overdrafts at high interest rates,

thereby affecting levels of profitability. This highlights

the need for the Government to actively explore

avenues to raise finance from non bank sources.

With regard to SOBEs, measures should be taken to

revise retail selling prices to reflect costs, while also

enhancing productivity, improving infrastructure,

reducing associated wastage to bring down the

overall cost of production and upgrade them as

autonomous entities, enabling them to operate on

their own without assistance from the government

budget. Further, immediate attention should be

given to improving the financial viability of SOBEs

by strengthening tariff collection, thereby enhancing

cashflow management, while also exploring

alternative low cost and long term financing options.

The implementation of the proposed reforms would

enhance public sector performance, thereby limiting

the need for banks’ support to meet the financing

needs of the public sector, facilitating near to

medium term economic stability and sustainable

growth in the long term.

The frequent volatility and persistence of

general price levels driven by food inflation,

which weakens the Central Bank’s efforts to

maintain inflation within the targeted range

and anchor inflation expectations, needs to be

controlled by government interventions on a

timely and sustainable basis. Since a large portion

of the consumer price basket of goods and services

consists of food items in Sri Lanka, frequent and

sizeable changes to the food prices cause volatility

in inflation. High, frequent and persistent deviations

of inflation from the inflation target mainly driven

by food inflation could derail inflation expectations,

thereby undermining the objectives of Flexible

Inflation Targeting (FIT). While supply side factors

largely trigger food price hikes in a country, demand

side factors could also complement such price hikes.

In Sri Lanka, supply driven factors, including the

pandemic and weather related supply disruptions, as

well as external factors such as large swings in global

food and commodity prices, were the main causes

of recent food inflation. Further, productivity losses

during the transition period to organic agriculture

practices and the legacy issues, such as post

harvest supply chain issues, limited storage, value

addition and preservation methodologies can also

be attributed to the acceleration in food prices. Food

prices driven inflation hikes are more regressive, as

they disproportionately affect less affluent sectors

of the society and deteriorate the living conditions

of the poor. Attempts to contain such supply driven

inflation mainly through monetary policy measures

could be counterproductive or ineffective. Hence,

implementing short to long term, well planned supply

side policies by the Government is imperative to

ensure the smooth functioning of domestic food

supply chains and to minimise the impact of upward

global price movements. These policies should

comprise improving domestic production, off season

cultivation, food storage infrastructure, adopting

preservation methodologies, minimising cost of

transportation, enhancing the technology used

in production and promoting cost effective import

substitution industries. Countries like India have

been able to soften their high food inflation through

implementing short term supply side measures such

as imposing stock limits, easing import restrictions,

reducing basic import duties, etc., in parallel with

successfully implementing the inflation targeting

framework. Although Sri Lanka has also taken such

short term policies within the limited fiscal space

available to address supply concerns, especially

related to transitory food price hikes, further

measures are required to maintain a robust and

resilient food supply chain in the country. During the

pandemic period, the Government took several short

term measures, such as removing travel restrictions

for those who are involved in the food supply chain to

continue their services. In the long run, appropriate

policies and infrastructure need to be in place

to invest in improving productivity in agriculture

and focus on food security issues. It will also be

important to obtain support from the private sector

in implementing these policies. The Government

has already initiated implementing infrastructure

and livelihood development programmes such as

“Vari Saubhagya” to ensure food safety through the

improvement of food production, while attempting to

promote the production of agricultural and industrial

goods that can be identified as import substitutes.

Further, it is important to have proper storage

systems with controlled environments in place to

reduce post harvest losses as well as for off season

storage. While the investments from the international

and domestic private sector would expand storage

and goods transportation facilities within the country,

the establishment of food banks will aid to make use

of regional food reserves in emergency situations.

Among other measures, it would be worthwhile to

have a specialised preparedness team consisting

of both government and private sectors to detect

possible developments leading to supply shortage

of essential food items early and make proactive

policy recommendations to the Government to

45

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

help prepare the economy to face likely shocks to

food supply. Moreover, it is vital to have a robust

regulatory framework on the functioning of food

supply chains from the agriculture sector to the

retail sector to avoid monopolies, undue dumping

of stocks and subsequent price hikes, thereby

reducing volatilities in food prices. Less volatility in

food inflation in shaping inflation dynamics, by way

of anchoring inflation expectations will help achieve

and maintain price stability.

Export industries need to build the capacity

and resilience to withstand risks posed by

the pandemic, and global issues that affect

global markets and commodity prices, while

forming strategies to grow and diversify.

Export industries, which were significantly

affected when the pandemic initially broke out

in 2020, recovered within a short time span and

recorded a notable growth to historically highest

ever export earnings in 2021. As the pandemic

intensified and continued, the main concerns for

the exports were the changes to demand patterns,

international maritime disturbances that resulted

in a surge in costs along with lack of vessels and

containers, mobility restrictions that disrupted

production and transport, the difficulty in sourcing

certain inputs, and the notable increase in the

cost of raw materials. Nevertheless, some export

categories performed well starting from the latter

part of 2020 (mainly agricultural exports), while

other export categories have only partly recovered

thus far. However, uncertainties still linger in the

international economy arising from the continuation

of the pandemic, monetary policy normalisation

in major economies, high commodity prices,

energy market issues and the recent geopolitical

tensions. Notwithstanding these difficulties, Sri

Lanka needs to identify that developing the export

sector during the ‘new normal’ as a policy priority

to increase non debt inflows and would accelerate

growth through the allocation of resources to

the productive tradeable sector in the economy.

External sector policies should not only focus on

the need for diversifying export markets but also

on the improved sophistication of export products

to more technologically advanced, high quality

and high value goods and services. Diversifying

into new export sectors with potential for higher

domestic value addition such as Information and IT/

BPO, electricals and electronics, processed food,

beverages, spices and concentrates, boatbuilding

and after sales services and pharmaceuticals, need

to be explored and supported through policies.

The exports sector would have to be supported by

conducive macroeconomic policies of the country,

particularly through maintaining a flexible exchange

rate, consistent tax and investment policies and

essential infrastructure facilities.

Adoption of stronger industrial policies and

strategies is necessary to ensure the availability

of essential goods in the country, develop import

substitution industries and to increase export

earnings. Even though Sri Lanka has been a trade

dependent economy for the past several decades,

the pandemic, the consequent global supply chain

issues and the current geopolitical tensions have

shown that it would be difficult for a country that

suffers from macroeconomic vulnerabilities to rely

heavily on other countries to secure an uninterrupted

supply of food and essential goods through

international trade, particularly during times of crisis.

The need for import substitution, at least for selected

essential goods that could be produced domestically

was felt strongly in the midst of difficulties to import

and shortages of goods in domestic markets. Such

essential goods include food, pharmaceuticals,

inputs that are necessary for industries, construction

material and machinery. The Government’s efforts

to develop the agricultural sector by discouraging

imports, forming plans to establish a pharmaceuticals

manufacturing zone, a textile manufacturing park,

etc., are commendable efforts in this regard.

46

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

Policies to promote backward integration of value

chains of major export sectors also support this. On

the other hand, carefully designed and strategised

substitution policies could save foreign exchange

for the country. Against this background, there is a

new wave of import substitution like policies adopted

by many other countries, especially after the global

pandemic. It was observed that large economies

such as China, India, the USA and several African

countries attempted to promote domestic production

recently by discouraging imports. Further, attracting

FDI not only for export oriented manufacturing, but

also for identified backward integration sectors may

also support higher control over the value chains,

while effectively substituting imports. However,

pursuing strong and continuous efforts focusing

on industrialisation under a comprehensive and

long lasting industrial policy, which is also linked to

agricultural policies, remains vital and urgent.

The export sectors development should

not rely heavily on free/preferential trade

agreements. Sri Lanka has preferential export

access to several foreign markets through eleven

Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) schemes

(including the EU GSP+). Meanwhile, Sri Lanka

has entered into seven multilateral and bilateral

trade agreements, which allow preferential access

to foreign markets under concessions. At the same

time, efforts are underway to negotiate and enter into

free/ preferential trade agreements with some trading

partners with high future potential such as China,

Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, and Bangladesh.

Although trade agreements generally focus on tariffs

and quotas, their scope has recently expanded to

include services exports, intellectual property rights

and patent rules, health and safety regulations,

labour and environmental standards, investments,

and banking. In the case of GSP schemes, countries

implementing them provide non reciprocal preferential

market access to selected counterparty countries

and Sri Lanka is a beneficiary of such schemes. The

beneficiary status of some GSP schemes depends

on criteria such as low GDP per capita and conditions

stipulated by the granting country such as good

governance requirements, labour standards, and

environmental factors. As the GDP per capita of Sri

Lanka increases, Sri Lanka stands to lose eligibility

for some of these schemes. Trade agreements and

GSP schemes also encompass rigorous Rules of

Origin requirements and hence should have high

value addition within Sri Lanka. Therefore, a number

of exports that utilise these trade agreements are

limited to agricultural exports and industrial goods

that depend on local inputs, such as rubber products.

It is difficult for exports, which use imported inputs

to a great extent, to meet stringent Rules of Origin

criteria. Hence, even for apparel, which is Sri Lanka’s

main export, the utilisation rate of schemes such as

the EU GSP+ is not high, compared to goods such

as rubber products, toys, and agricultural exports.

It is evident that when Sri Lanka lost the EU GSP+

status between August 2010 and May 2017, exports

to the EU did not decline considerably. Despite these

concerns, some exports enjoy significant benefits

through low tariffs under these schemes/agreements.

As a result, out of total export earnings in 2021,

about 43 per cent were earned through exports

under the preferential trade agreements, including

GSP schemes. However, the fact that a large share

of export earnings to Sri Lanka have been earned

under trade agreements does not necessarily mean

that such agreements were the single main reason

for the reported increase in exports. Such exports

may be incentivised by other factors pertaining to

the exporting entity, domestic economic factors,

and global market factors. Meanwhile, the trade

agreements of other countries such as the Regional

Comprehensive Economic Partnership (“RCEP”

entered into by 30 countries in East Asia, Southeast

Asia and Oceania), also raise questions about

Sri Lanka’s future competitiveness. Although the

benefits of trade agreements and GSP schemes on

Sri Lanka’s exports have been significant, it would

47

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

be prudent to reduce the dependency on such

trade agreements or schemes, while considering

successful integration with global value chains and

diversification of exported goods, while broadening

the export market. However, free/preferential trade

agreements must be entered into only if the potential

increase in exports or cost saving from imports

can be identified and justified. Nevertheless, rather

than relying too much on duty concessions, export

promotion policies need to focus on exporting

improved quality goods with high value addition at

lower costs of production, achieved through research

and development led innovation, over the medium to

long term.

The increased demand for higher education

abroad and the significantly high foreign

exchange outlay highlight the need for urgently

addressing issues pertaining to higher

education opportunities available domestically.

Despite the commitment of successive governments

to the provision of free education and upgrading

of infrastructure related to the provision of higher

education, a large number of qualified students

remain outside the ambit of the public education

system at the graduate and postgraduate levels. In

2020, although approximately 63 per cent of those

who sat for GCE Advanced Level examination

were eligible to enter the public tertiary education

system, only 22 per cent of the qualified students

were admitted into the system, in spite of the

recent increases in intakes. Accordingly, the limited

number of opportunities available in the domestic

public and private higher education systems has

translated into students steadily departing for

higher education abroad. A key issue in this regard

is the substantial outflow of foreign exchange,

which could also add pressure to the prevailing

imbalances in the external sector. Moreover,

as the economy integrates more into the global

economy, it is expected that the domestic labour

force would have to transform to cater to the

dynamic demands of a modern work environment.

Especially, when the IT/BPO sector is expected

to expand into a US dollars 5 billion industry and

as Sri Lanka continues to strive to attract FDI,

the availability of a pool of skilled labour with

internationally recognised qualifications will be

essential. Similarly, new employment opportunities

that will be created in the Colombo Port City and

International Financial City would also require such

a pool of skilled people. Accordingly, improving

the opportunities for domestic education at the

international standard will help to improve the

required skills of the workforce while enabling to

retain the talent within the country to some extent,

along with further expansion in the services sector.

Therefore, focused policy initiatives to improve the

standards of local universities, alongside capacity

improvements, are essential not only to retain

domestic students but also to attract international

students from foreign shores. Further, it is also

important for private higher education institutions

to focus on building ‘university-class’ infrastructure

comprising accommodation facilities, social

activities, specialised research and laboratory

facilities, among others. Such initiatives will not

only contribute to improving standards of learning

delivery, but also to the overall learning experience

which is also a key point of attraction for students

who are currently emigrating for higher education.

The Government may consider facilitating an

expansion in the private higher education sector

with increased collaborations with the world class

universities along with international accreditation.

Further, facilitating foreign based universities to

establish branch universities in Sri Lanka would be

a welcome move to attract international students

to its shores as a study abroad destination, while

accommodating local students to study from

renowned foreign institutions while being on

shores. It is also required to attract world class

faculty members under a residential visa scheme

to enrich the quality of education provision by

48

internationally accredited educational institutions.

Such an arrangement would enhance FDI flows

and bring in technical and technological know-how.

Such initiatives can facilitate the country’s ongoing

efforts to emerge as a leading provider of IT/BPO

solutions as it would enable elevating the quantity

and quality of labour produced to cater to this

industry and serve to attract international students

who can later continue here as ‘digital nomads’.

This can pave the way for an overall improvement in

access to higher education without the Government

having to bear the entire burden of such expansion,

while also enabling the higher education sector to

emerge as a key foreign exchange earning sector

in the future.

Despite the transformation of the agriculture

sector since independence, Sri Lanka continues

to grapple with the creation of a sustainable

agriculture sector that is capable of generating

healthy income levels while ensuring food

security and efficient ecosystem management

to enhance the overall productivity of the sector.

The agriculture drive in the 1960s to develop the

agriculture sector to fulfil the growing demands

of the economy entailed the rapid introduction of

high yielding crop varieties alongside increased

usage of chemical fertilisers as well as other agro-

chemical inputs under a fertiliser subsidy scheme. In

subsequent periods, Sri Lanka continued to provide

fertiliser concessions to farmers by way of cash grants

or issuance of fertiliser free of charge or at a rate below

market value with the view to ensuring sustained

increases in production. In turn, the continuation

of such concessions to farmers alongside poor

extension services, and lack of farmer awareness

have led to excessive use of chemical or inorganic

materials in the agriculture production process,

thus creating long term negative effects on human

wellbeing, health and ecosystems, in addition to the

associated expenditure burden on the fiscal front.

Also, the abundance of low cost chemical fertiliser

at below market prices in the country has prevented

farmers from using organic manure as well as other

organic and sustainable agriculture practices in

cultivation given the labour and time intensity of such

practices. The use of organic fertiliser can always

generate multiple benefits to growers, consumers

as well as the environment. It supports nutrient

and water retention, and thereby soil fertility, while

maintaining soil biodiversity. However, excessive

usage of chemical fertiliser and non-usage of

organic fertiliser and soil conservation practices in

the agriculture systems in Sri Lanka have resulted

in the weakening of the natural environment through

soil degradation, pollution of ground and surface

water, eutrophication, and disruption of aquatic

ecosystems. Meanwhile, the excessive usage of

agrochemicals is also expected to cause significant

negative impacts on biodiversity, while also creating

direct and indirect health hazards. Accordingly,

there is an urgent need for devising a long term

policy framework targeted at promoting sustainable

agriculture, which will ensure economic profitability,

social and economic equity as well as environmental

health. While recognising the Government’s efforts

to promote organic fertiliser with a view to limiting

the excessive use of synthetic manure in agriculture,

it must be noted that only a holistic strategy that

encompasses all the elements related to sustainable

agriculture could ensure the fulfilment of the needs

of the present generation without compromising the

needs of future generations. This is also essential

considering the fact that almost one-third of

Sri Lanka’s labour force is engaged in the agriculture

sector and many of their livelihoods are consistently

vulnerable owing to the sector’s lack of resilience

to the shocks. In this regard, the Government must

facilitate the creation of a sustainable agriculture

base that will enable farmers to capitalise on

these sustainable and climate smart agricultural

practices. Accordingly, urgent measures focusing

on establishing a precision agriculture system

that would encourage the optimal use of inputs in

49

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

agriculture are needed. Under such approach, the

promotion of organic fertiliser, while encouraging

efficient and optimal use of chemical fertiliser

remains of utmost importance. Given the frequent

drought spells experienced by the country in recent

times, efficient management of water should also

be promoted through reduced volume irrigation

systems such as drip irrigation and the introduction of

drought tolerant crop species. Also, major emphasis

should be given to soil conservation strategies to

ensure long term soil productivity in agricultural

lands and to minimise landslide hazards. At the

same time, addressing the issues of growing food

demand, climate change as well as limited arable

land, it is vital to promote innovative ways of farming,

including vertical farming and urban farming, while

mechanising agriculture activities in the traditional

agriculture sector. Meanwhile, the promotion of

domestic production of fertiliser, agrochemicals as

well as seeds is essential in achieving sustainability

in agriculture since the country is highly reliant on

imported seeds, fertilisers, and agrochemicals.

Towards the endeavour of building a sustainable

agriculture sector, creating awareness of

sustainable, climate smart and good agriculture

practices among all the stakeholders would enable

a faster transition. Moreover, a well developed and a

coherent mechanism with a suitable transition period

is essential to transform the present agriculture

system of Sri Lanka into a sustainable system, while

ensuring that the full benefits of such a transition are

passed on to all those engaged in the agricultural

supply chains.

Despite being a key driver of economic

growth and having more potential for further

growth, Micro, Small and Medium sized

Enterprises (MSMEs) in Sri Lanka face numerous

hindrances, thus necessitating policy priorities

at the national level. More than 99 per cent of

establishments in the non agricultural sector in

Sri Lanka are found to be MSMEs, contributing

to about 75 per cent of employment within the

non agriculture sector.3 Different studies report

the contribution of MSMEs to economic activity in

Sri Lanka to be more than 50 per cent. However,

this appears to be relatively low when compared

to developed nations and even some developing

economies. These observations suggest that

despite the existence of a large number of MSMEs in

Sri Lanka, their economic contribution may not have

reached its potential yet. Over several decades,

MSMEs in Sri Lanka endured difficult circumstances

due to various reasons including natural disasters,

terrorist activities, health crises, etc. In order to

support MSMEs during such periods, for example,

during the pandemic, the Government and the

Central Bank provided a substantial package of

financial and non-financial reliefs similar to many

other countries. Nevertheless, a considerable

number of businesses and individuals in this sector

may not have recovered or even explored the

potential of such support schemes. It has been

identified that several issues have hindered the

progress of the MSME sector, including insufficient

access to finance as well as poor financial literacy.

Many MSMEs do not possess the required financial

literacy to prepare project proposals with sufficient

information required by financial institutions, while

financial reporting remains relatively weak among

these entrepreneurs, thereby forcing financial

institutions to rely on collateral based selection, which

restricts the ability of MSMEs to obtain loans due to

their inherently small asset base, in turn driving them

to utilise the services of informal lenders as well.

Considering the difficulties encountered by MSMEs

when securing finance for their projects amidst a lack

of sufficiently acceptable collateral, the Government

in consultation with several stakeholders embarked

on an initiative to set up a Credit Guarantee Institution

(CGI), which was a long overdue requirement. With

the implementation of the CGI, the funding concerns

3 As reported in the Economic Census 2013/2014, conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics.

50

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

1

of MSMEs are expected to ease, to some extent, and

enhance their prospects as well as their contribution

to overall economic activity, going forward. The

expeditious operationalisation of the CGI would

immensely support the MSME sector to thrive.

Meanwhile, the establishment of a well functioning

development bank is also a necessity to support

small businesses in the country, and this has been

highlighted for several years. Further, the possibility

of adopting and popularising alternative funding

avenues for MSMEs that have been successful in

various countries, such as crowdfunding, venture

capital investments, pitch competitions, etc. also

needs to be explored. At the same time, MSMEs

can benefit from improving awareness of equity

finance opportunities, such as those facilitated by

the CSE via its Empower Board. Other impediments

that limit MSMEs from reaching their true potential

include, low levels of managerial skills, use of

outdated technology and the resulting low quality

of output, limited market knowledge, information

asymmetry, and certain cultural perceptions that are

less conducive to entrepreneurial development. A

close look at some of these factors highlights that

these are interconnected issues which reinforce

each other, requiring collective effort to overcome

them successfully. Although the multitude of

initiatives undertaken by the Government and

other agencies have helped many individuals and

businesses to overcome some of these issues,

MSMEs operating in Sri Lanka still have substantial

space for improvement. It is important to continue

the efforts undertaken to strengthen managerial

and entrepreneurial skills and to improve financial

literacy among Sri Lankan MSMEs. The provision of

business consultancy and credit advisory services

by both Government and non government agencies

need to be enhanced, while such services could be

offered and popularised via special units in financial

institutions as well, ultimately leading to financial

arrangements. Further, developing marketing

opportunities, both domestically and internationally,

is vital for the success of MSMEs, while enabling

supply chain integrations with large businesses will

help improve the resilience of the sector. At the same

time, a holistic effort is needed from all stakeholders

to improve the use of new technology by MSMEs, so

that the quality of their output is improved and their

access to markets is enhanced. It is also important

to improve coordination among various arms of

the Government and non government agencies,

which provide support to MSMEs to improve their

effectiveness. Improving awareness of these various

support elements is essential so that businesses

and individuals can easily reach them when needed.

At the same time, the entire MSME sector would

benefit from a well coordinated grievance handling

mechanism operating at a district or divisional

secretariat level, which would contribute to easing

operating difficulties faced by them and could serve

as a conduit for the escalation of any major issues

to higher levels to be addressed through appropriate

policies. Further, efforts to minimise long standing

impediments in the doing business environment

of the country would undoubtedly help the MSME

sector as well, while facilitating improvements

across all business activities in the economy.

Despite several policy initiatives, Sri Lanka

continues to struggle with waste management

issues that have been further amplified by the

COVID-19 pandemic. In recent years, Sri Lanka has

been in the spotlight regarding its waste management

practices, especially with the garbage landslide

disaster in Meethotamulla in 2017 and more recent

incidents of wildlife being affected by open waste

dumps. Despite there being several national and micro

level initiatives and goals regarding the improvement

of waste management practices, there has been a

consistent lag in the effective implementation of such

initiatives. Further, the outbreak of the COVID-19

pandemic and the resultant increase in healthcare

waste such as masks, Personal Protective Equipment

(PPE), gloves, handkerchiefs, tissues, sanitary

51

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

pads, diapers, and other materials contaminated

by body fluids of patients, disposed from healthcare

institutions, quarantine centres and households

has become a serious concern as such ‘single-use’

items are unlikely to reduce in the periods ahead.

The National Audit Report on Healthcare Waste

Management - 2019 highlights that approximately 70

per cent of the audited hospitals were not complying

with healthcare waste management standards during

the pre-pandemic period. This poses significant

contemporary risks as nonadherence to healthcare

waste management standards and inappropriate

disposal of hazardous and infectious waste create

serious threats to the environment, public health,

and biodiversity. In addition to the substantial

increase in clinical waste from designated COVID-19

hospitals and treatment centres, there has been an

increase in the open burning of clinical waste during

the pandemic period. Despite the Government’s

initiatives to address these concerns through the

issuance of guidelines for healthcare facilities and

increased resources for clinical waste handling,

healthcare facilities still face significant resource and

technical limitations such as limited waste storage,

transportation and incineration facilities. In addition

to the expeditious completion of the Metro Colombo

Solid Waste Management Project, it will also be

essential to focus on establishing waste to energy

power plants, one of which was commenced in early

2021 with a generation capacity of 10 MW. The

construction of such power plants has been delayed

due to high levels of capital outlay associated with

such projects. However, the timely establishment of

these projects can be a cornerstone solution not only

to the country's solid waste management problems

but also to the country’s electricity needs. Global

trends highlight that there is immense potential to

attract FDI and even multilateral funding to waste

management and recycling projects as investors

and donor agencies are looking for opportunities for

returns while also contributing to global sustainability

initiatives through such greenfield projects. Proper

implementation of an efficient waste collection

mechanism, upgrading of existing disposal practices

as well as the provision of adequate mechanical

and biological treatment facilities, are imperative to

address the country's growing waste management

issue. Accordingly, there is a dire need for continued

commitment to multi sectoral initiatives focused not

only on recycling and composting waste, but also

on reducing waste and encouraging reuse thereby

paving the way for the creation of both sustainable

development in the short term and transitioning to a

circular economy over the long term.

Focusing on ‘green’ development remains

a critical contemporary need to ensure that Sri

Lanka’s natural resources are better conserved

and restored so that the economy can reap the

full potential of its ecosystem. There is widespread

consensus on the need for striking a balance

between economic growth derived through resource

consumption and conservation of the environment

to preserve the existing natural resources, thereby

addressing the issue of climate change. In recent

years, there have been significant concerns about the

impact of climate change with the frequent occurrences

of natural disasters such as flooding and landslides,

and drought conditions, among others. A recent study

by the World Bank highlights that the temperature

rise in Sri Lanka is projected to be only marginally

lower than the global average indicating that periods

of extreme heat will increase and stay persistent in

the future. Such temperature increases can pose

a threat to the well-being of the people, especially

those in dry areas, and have direct implications on

the economy, especially in relation to agricultural

productivity, labour productivity and energy security.

The study also highlights Sri Lanka’s vulnerability to

potential increases in the frequency and intensity of

extreme precipitation events, such as the torrential

rains, which could render significant risks to lives,

livelihoods and infrastructure due to the resultant

floods and landslides that may occur. The largest

52

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

1

impact of such volatilities stemming from the natural

environment will be on the poorest and marginalised

communities, particularly the large segment of

the population engaged in agriculture. Amid such

concerns, several other issues continue to affect the

quality of natural environments in the country such as

the decades long human elephant conflicts, incidents

of sand mining, the release of hazardous waste to

water bodies by industries, forest destruction and

the recent X-Press Pearl Maritime disaster. All these

environmental concerns will have lasting, persistent,

and potentially recurring negative socioeconomic

implications. This emphasises the urgent need for

committing to forward-looking and holistic policy

initiatives that will pave way for sustainable natural

resource management. Continuous monitoring of the

status of natural resources is an essential aspect,

which needs to be strengthened through a stringent

regulatory and legal framework that ensures the

prevention of environmental and natural resource

crimes such as illegal logging, poaching and even

Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing,

which are rarely prosecuted. The Government and the

Central Bank should also work together to promote

sustainable finance practices in Sri Lanka that will be

instrumental in routing credit towards environmentally

friendly businesses.

Despite the country’s efforts to achieve its

target of alleviating all forms of malnutrition

by 2030, as declared under the Sustainable

Development Goals (SDGs), developments

pertaining to COVID-19 and other supply side

shocks observed recently in relation to agricultural

commodities may threaten the outcomes achieved

thus far, while posing hindrances to long term

development. Although Sri Lanka made remarkable

progress in achieving many of the national level

targets under the Millennium Development Goals

(MDGs) to uplift the socioeconomic wellbeing of the

community by 2015, performance across the targets

set for nutrition continued to remain unachievable

reflecting the prevalence of nutrition related anomalies

across geographical regions and economic sectors.

As per the Demographic and Health Survey – 2016

of the DCS, some malnutrition related indicators

such as stunting (height for age), wasting (weight for

height), prevalence of obesity (weight for age) as well

as low birth weight continued to remain unachieved

compared to the national targets set for improving

maternal, infant and child nutrition, with the estate

sector showing the poorest nutritional outcomes.

Such disparities and concerns are likely to have been

aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021,

Sri Lanka’s Child Multidimensional Poverty Indicator

(CMPI) indicated that about 42.2 per cent of children

aged between 0-4 years old were multidimensionally

poor with 33.4 per cent experiencing deprivations

in relation to nutrition. Further, the recent supply

side shocks observed regarding the availability and

affordability of food, stemming from both global and

domestic developments, raises concerns about

long term impacts on nutritional outcomes of the

population, especially children and women. The

high levels of food inflation that occur occasionally

may have scarring impacts on the future productivity

of the population, if allowed to persist. It must be

noted that the Government’s provision of cash

transfers and food distribution programmes targeting

households below the poverty line is expected

to have cushioned the negative impact on the

nutrition status of such households to some extent.

This reiterates the importance of the adoption of

a holistic policy approach comprising near to long

term strategies to ensure food security. Such policy

initiatives should not only focus on availability through

improved productivity in the agriculture sector but

also post harvest marketing and distribution. As part

of initiatives that are underway to improve domestic

production, there is a need to strengthen databases

relating to both national demand and domestic

supply, especially for essential food commodities.

Realistic and timely forward looking assessments

on the part of relevant institutions in the agricultural

53

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

sector are essential for proactive planning and timely

implementation of remedial measures to safeguard

the food security status and overall wellbeing of the

population. It is to be noted that in the past, Sri Lanka

received the assistance of multilateral donor agencies

to strengthen the agriculture sector and food security

status of the country. Despite Sri Lanka’s progression

into the middle income status, multilateral assistance

in this regard, such as through the UN’s World

Food Programme, the World Bank and the Asian

Development Bank is widely available. Tapping

into such sources, both for funding and to improve

technical capacity in relation to data collection,

analysis, and monitoring, may not only contribute to

improving the nutritional status of the population but

also improve the resilience of the agriculture sector

and augment the food security status of the country

in the long term.

The largely stagnant levels of female labour

force participation observed in Sri Lanka for the

past three decades highlight that a significant

portion of the labour force remains outside the

ambit of the economy’s growth and development

processes, warranting urgent attention as the

economy attempts to rapidly recover from the

effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and progress

onto a higher growth trajectory. Sri Lanka took

almost four decades to double its female labour force

participation rate from about 19 per cent in 1953 to

36 per cent in 1990. Since then, the female labour

force participation rate has averaged just 33 per cent

and has been on a declining trend in recent years.

Although, Sri Lanka is ahead of the South Asian

average of 24 per cent, the country’s female labour

force participation remains much lower than the

‘upper middle income’ country average of 55 per cent.

The continued stagnation of the female labour force

participation is a key policy issue to be addressed

as the economy struggles with a rapidly ageing

population, labour productivity issues and increasing

migration, especially of skilled and semi skilled

workers. With due consideration for considerable

investments that consecutive governments have

made in the education and health sector over the last

seven decades, it is noted that bringing women into the

labour force and thereby creating an expansion of the

labour force can have significant positive impacts on

the growth process of the country, while also ensuring

the efficacy of such investments, amid limited fiscal

space. Initiatives in this regard should also focus

on ensuring that women avail of ‘decent work’,4 as

outlined in the SDGs. The need to engage women

in ‘decent work’ is underscored by the developments

arising due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has

caused a rise in the socioeconomic vulnerability of

women as they tend to be employed in vulnerable

jobs in the services or agriculture sectors and are

more likely to be underpaid or engaged under less

favourable working terms. Since long, there has

been a broad consensus that policies focused on

alleviating the ‘triple burden’ of women and thereby

enhancing female labour force participation are

lacking in Sri Lanka. This is evident from the dearth in

the availability of affordable and regulated childcare

or elderly care facilities, the absence of flexible

working arrangements and the lack of reliable and

safe modes of public transportation – international

experiences highlight these as essential to improve

the female labour force participation. Developing

such infrastructure can lead to better absorption of

females into the labour force thereby paving way for

an increase in overall welfare through the increase in

the productive resource base of the economy. Over

the medium term, the higher levels of household

incomes can translate into improved education and

nutritional outcomes for future generations, thereby

contributing to consistent improvements in the

productivity of the labour force. Accordingly, it is vital

to devise a targeted, holistic and multi sectoral policy

initiative that supports stronger diversity and inclusion

in a gender sensitive manner.

4 The International Labour Organization (ILO) defines decent work as ‘productive work for women and men in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity’.

Against this backdrop, committed efforts of

the Government and all stakeholders in defying

the looming dire economic consequences and

keeping the economy floating with a sense

of urgency, while addressing the structural

issues remain the immediate priority to

achieve sustainable growth and to preserve

macroeconomic stability going forward.

While the COVID-19 pandemic has uncovered

unprecedented opportunities to implement bold

and better coordinated policy reforms, with the

support of an external engagement, such as an

economic adjustment programme supported by

the IMF, exploring undiscovered new challenges,

and addressing such challenges without delays

through concerted efforts remain extremely vital

at this juncture in order to reap tangible and

broad-based benefits to the economy for robust

macroeconomic stability and growth outlook,

which will also ensure fulfilling the expectations of

the general public at large.
