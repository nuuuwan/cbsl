"The Sri Lankan economy recovered in 2021 from the pandemic induced contraction in 2020, albeit 
early 2022. The economy was already in a fragile state lacking the necessary buffers to withstand shocks,"
"when  it  was  hit  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  other  multifaceted  headwinds  that  emanated  from  the"
"global and domestic fronts. Such vulnerability of the economy can be mainly attributed to the lack of fiscal"
