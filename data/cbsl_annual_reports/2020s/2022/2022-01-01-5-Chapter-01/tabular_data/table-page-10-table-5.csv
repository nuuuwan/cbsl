The prime concern often raised with regard to approaching 
the IMF for a programme is the conditionalities attached 
to it. Conditionalities in IMF programmes in general cover 
key  macroeconomic  and  structural  policy  adjustments. 
Even  though  these  conditionalities  were  largely  focused 
on  macroeconomic  policies  until  the  early  1980s,  the 
complexity and scope of structural conditions increased 
subsequently,  reflecting  the  IMF’s  growing  involvement 
in 
conditionalities  are  intended  to  help  countries  resolve 
BOP problems, while avoiding recurring instances of such 
problems. Further, the remedial measures are intended to 
ensure that the country’s BOP will be strong enough to 
meet payments for imports and to service external debt in 
a sustained manner. 
The policy commitments agreed with country authorities 
generally include:
