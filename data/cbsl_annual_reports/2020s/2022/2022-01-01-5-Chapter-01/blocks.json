    "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an organisation established in 1944 to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world. The IMF usually provides loans under its programmes to member countries that experience Balance of Payments (BOP) problems to support rebuilding international reserves, stabilising currencies, ensuring continuity in payments for imports, and restoring economic growth, while correcting underlying problems. All IMF members are eligible to access IMF\u2019s resources in the General Resources Account (GRA) on non concessional terms, and the IMF also provides concessional financial support through the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), which is tailored to the diversity and needs of low-income countries. For emerging and advanced market economies in crises, IMF assistance is provided through Stand-By Arrangements (SBAs) to address short term or potential BOP problems. The Stand-By Credit Facility (SCF) serves a similar purpose for low-income countries. The Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the corresponding Extended Credit Facility (ECF) for low-income countries are the main facilities aimed at providing medium term support to countries facing protracted BOP problems. To help prevent or mitigate crises and boost market confidence, members with already strong policies can use the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) or the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL). The Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) and the corresponding Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) for low-income countries provide rapid assistance to countries with urgent BOP needs, including difficulties posed by commodity price shocks, natural disasters, and domestic fragilities. Objectives, policies and conditionality under an IMF funding arrangement depend on a country\u2019s specific economic circumstances.",

Conditionalities in IMF programmes in general cover key macroeconomic and structural policy adjustments. Even though these conditionalities were largely focused on macroeconomic policies until the early 1980s, the complexity and scope of structural conditions increased subsequently, reflecting the IMF\u2019s growing involvement in low-income and transitional countries. These conditionalities are intended to help countries resolve BOP problems, while avoiding recurring instances of such problems. Further, the remedial measures are intended to ensure that the country\u2019s BOP will be strong enough to meet payments for imports and to service external debt in a sustained manner.",

For the RCF and the RFI facilities provided by the IMF, there is no ex-post programme based conditionality or reviews except for limited overall conditionality. If a country fails to meet QPC, the IMF Executive Board may approve a waiver if it is satisfied that the programme will still succeed, provided that the deviation is minor/temporary or national authorities are taking corrective actions.

The most successful IMF programme was the SBA which commenced in 2009, in which the IMF disbursed the full allocation of funds to Sri Lanka. The previous IMF programmes concentrated primarily on improving foreign reserves and the conduct of monetary policy. In addition, there was emphasis on undertaking vital structural reforms that included the introduction of a fuel price formula, improving the Central Bank\u2019s independence, a flexible exchange rate policy, and revenue based fiscal consolidation. In the Sri Lankan context, for official dealings with the IMF, the Hon. Minister of Finance holds the capacity of the Governor of the IMF, and the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) holds the capacity of the Alternate Governor of the IMF.",

Notably, the need to seek external assistance is a result of the failure to take initiative as a country to introduce structural reforms, which are often included in IMF programmes as well. Most reforms identified in the previous IMF programmes have not been completed fully or abandoned abruptly after drawing some disbursements under the financing facilities, while meeting only short term objectives. This has led to a cycle of being in and out of IMF programmes frequently as shown in Table B 1.1. In contrast, India, which obtained seven programmes from the IMF during 1951 to 1993, has not approached the IMF since the conclusion of its last programme in 1993. If an IMF programme is completed successfully, the economy would be able to reap the long term benefits, especially through structural adjustments, and the need to approach the IMF on future occasions of short term economic stresses would have been minimal. A summary of the success of the latest IMF programmes extended in 2009 and 2016 to Sri Lanka in terms of fulfilling the conditionalities is as follows.",

However, unlike in previous occasions, in the current context, an IMF programme will be an important part of strategies to overcome prevailing challenging economic conditions in the country. Considering the current low level of international reserves, servicing the significantly high debt repayments due in the near term will be extremely challenging. Liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market has dried up amidst high foreign debt service payments and the reduction in foreign exchange inflows, resulting in significant depletion of gross official reserves and inadequate foreign exchange to meet the forex demands for essential imports, such as fuel, gas, coal, medicine, and essential food items. In this context, there is a need for securing a sizeable amount of foreign financing in the immediate future. Entering into an IMF programme would not only provide access to additional financing but would also enhance the confidence of potential foreign investors, including multilateral and bilateral counterparts. This, coupled with the implementation of a macroeconomic policy package, is expected to stabilise the overall macroeconomy which will further promote non debt creating financial inflows.",

Some of the aforementioned measures have been already implemented by the CBSL and the Government. The monetary policy has been significantly tightened,",

These macroeconomic stabilisation measures could result in a painful adjustment to the economy in the adjustment stage, but it has become imperative considering the current economic crisis. However, in order to successfully implement an IMF programme, the country should ensure the management of external debt sustainably through appropriate measures. Towards this end, the Government has already announced the suspension of external debt servicing for an interim period pending an orderly and consensual restructuring of debt obligations in a manner consistent with an economic adjustment programme supported by the IMF. Further, political and social stability needs to be achieved through an agreement between all relevant stakeholders to successfully negotiate and implement an IMF programme. The success of this will also rest on the extent to which the long neglected structural reforms are implemented in a way that ensures sustainable macroeconomic stability.",

In response, by establishing a Foreign Exchange Budget Committee, the Government imposed rigorous import control measures including imposition of quotas, licenses and tariffs on imports except food, petroleum and pharmaceutical imports. The development strategy of the Government was based on encouraging import substitution and domestic agricultural expansion to reduce import expenditure and achieve self sufficiency in essential commodities. By the mid 1960s, the economy was heavily regulated with protectionist measures and an overvalued fixed exchange rate was maintained. Meanwhile, export promotion strategies were also adopted to arrest the BOP issues.",

As an integral part of the liberal policy regime, the dual exchange rate system was abolished by establishing a unified exchange rate. The transition from a fixed exchange rate regime to a managed float exchange rate regime, which determined the exchange rate based on market demand and supply conditions, was a radical shift in Sri Lanka\u2019s exchange rate policy. A plethora of exchange control relaxation measures were also implemented. These policy measures included removal of restrictions on current transactions, lifting of quantitative import restrictions, rationalisation and simplification of import tariff structure, and removal of price controls and licensing requirements. Simultaneously, in view of reducing the adverse implications stemming from fiscal sector imbalances, many fiscal reforms, such as restructuring of food subsidies, privatising government enterprises and promoting private sector led growth, were introduced. Incentives were provided to encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) to export industries and export processing zones. Foreign financial flows gradually started to increase after 1977, with the relaxation of exchange restrictions. Subsequently, with the economy",

Lackluster performance in export earnings and increasing import expenditure led to a widening deficit in merchandise trade over the years. Although Sri Lanka was one of the first countries in the region to adopt liberal economic policies in 1977, its trade openness remains low. Trade openness, which is the total value of exports and imports in relation to the country\u2019s GDP, was 36.4 per cent in 1977 and it nearly doubled to 72.2 per cent by 1979. However, Sri Lanka\u2019s international trade performance has not been impressive in terms of trade openness, declining to levels that were seen during the pre-liberalisation era by 2019, where Sri Lanka's trade openness was 38.0 per cent. Workers\u2019 remittances have also shown a declining trend since mid 2021, contributing to widening current account deficits.",

When comparing the external debt as a percentage of GDP with its regional peers, Sri Lanka has recorded the highest ratio after Bhutan, Maldives and Cambodia.

Total external debt service payments as a percentage of export of goods and services has increased from 13.2 per cent in 2011 to 30.0 per cent in 2021 indicating that nearly one third of Sri Lanka\u2019s annual export earnings are consumed for debt servicing.

However, following the adjustment in the exchange rate in early March 2022 and subsequent market pressure, the Sri Lanka rupee depreciated sharply by 33.0 per cent against the US dollar by end March 2022. However, some stability in the exchange rate is expected with the significant tightening of the monetary policy stance in early April 2022 along with other corrective measures currently being considered to be implemented with immediate effect, which mainly include, initiating discussions with the IMF for an economic adjustment programme, suspension of external debt servicing for an interim period leading to an orderly and consensual debt restructuring process, and fiscal consolidation, along with the negotiations to obtain bridging financing.",

Further, rules were issued requiring hotel service providers registered with the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority to accept payments in respect of services rendered to non residents only in foreign exchange. Moreover, the Central Bank has also been able to secure foreign financial assistance from regional central banks by way of bilateral currency swaps.

Hence, increasing the country\u2019s gross official reserves remain the most important medium term objective of the external sector. The country envisages to enhance gross official reserves to cover a minimum of 4 months of merchandise imports. While these targets remain significantly challenging, the ongoing efforts towards debt restructuring and envisaged foreign currency inflows are expected to increase gradually over the medium to long term, enabling the gradual build-up of gross official reserves. While the medium term objective of the Central Bank is to gradually increase the quantity of reserves, the composition is also expected to be improved by organic build-up of reserves through non-borrowed sources.",

It will be important to revive the NES with some modifications to suit the more recent developments in international trade and provide much needed policy support to the exports sector and such policies should continue without interruption under any political regime. Implementation of a broad based and consistent NES is expected to create steady and sustainable growth in exports while unlocking potential export sectors to create new job opportunities and facilitating value addition through increased participation in global value chains and product sharing networks. Along with these, measures should be introduced and monitored in attracting investment to the tradable sector, especially for industries producing intermediate goods for the export sector and industries oriented mainly towards global trade.",

It is imperative that the long neglected structural reforms are introduced in the immediate future to reduce the external current account deficit and the fiscal deficit, which remained the root cause of the recurring external sector instability for decades. Managing the twin deficits at sustainable levels is crucial to ensure long term sustainability in country\u2019s external debt, while maintaining healthy levels of reserves to withstand economic headwinds, thereby ensuring long term stability of the external sector.",

Further, narrowing of the gap between the official exchange rate and the grey market rate is also expected to help attract higher foreign remittances formally.

    "text": "Fiscal policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic curbed the scarring effects on economies across the world facilitating post pandemic recovery, albeit with a notable bearing on public finances, and in turn resulting in fiscal stress in these countries. The swift fiscal measures deployed in response to the unanticipated and unprecedented economic headwinds were disparate in scale, type, and coverage and were dependent on the specific structural, inherent and fiscal leeway of each economy. Advance markets and large emerging markets were in relatively better positions with ample fiscal space to accommodate such fiscal stimuli, compared to small emerging markets and developing economies. Direct budgetary measures such as increased spending on health, provision of unemployment benefits and other reliefs, tax concessions and tax deferments, liquidity support, equity injections, and indirect actions including provision of guarantees for deferred debt repayments were among common fiscal policy measures implemented by numerous countries. The steady stream of fiscal stimuli via deficit spending, and lingering effects of the pandemic together with the slowdown in economic growth have put pressure on fiscal operations of most economies, thereby threatening macroeconomic stability in respective countries.",

    "text": "The outbreak of the pandemic and related uncertainties have severely affected Sri Lanka, prominently the fiscal sector, as reported in many other lower middle-income and market access countries. Despite insufficient fiscal space to undertake hefty fiscal intervention, the Sri Lankan Government also committed to providing a number of fiscal stimuli to address pressing priorities since the onset of the pandemic. With increased expenses for healthcare and pandemic control measures as well as financial and in-kind transfers to vulnerable groups, the Government spent at least Rs. 117.5 billion and Rs. 165.6 billion as pandemic related expenses for 2020 and 2021, respectively. The Government instituted a low tax regime to boost the sluggish economic activity since the latter part of 2019 and this low tax environment was upheld during the pandemic period. Several tax reliefs for certain essential imports such as medicines were also granted during this period. Consequently, government revenue dwindled sharply during the pandemic period owing to modest tax rates, and diminished tax base due to the increases in tax free thresholds as well as subpar economic growth. Accordingly, fiscal deficit in 2020 and 2021 increased to 11.1 per cent and 12.2 per cent of the GDP, respectively. Meanwhile, as per the Fiscal Monitor Database of Fiscal Policy Responses to COVID-19 Pandemic \u2013 October 2021, the cumulative value of additional spending and foregone revenue by the Sri Lankan Government in relation to the pandemic was around 1.1 per cent of the GDP, which",

In addition, with limited fiscal space to manoeuvre, pandemic affected individuals and businesses in Sri Lanka were mainly supported by accommodative monetary policy. Moreover, reduced foreign inflows amidst the pandemic and substantial debt service payments added further stress on the fiscal and external sectors. With limited avenues for new foreign financing sources, liquidity constraints in the international capital markets as well as sovereign rating downgrades of Sri Lanka, the Government was compelled to resort to higher domestic borrowings, especially through the Central Bank and the banking sector, to meet the government financing gaps. Such fiscal imbalances led to the government debt reaching 100.6 per cent and 104.6 per cent of GDP by end 2020 and end 2021, respectively.",

For several decades, Sri Lanka has been plagued by persistent fiscal deficits, compelling the Government to continually borrow from both domestic and foreign markets and accumulate public debt. As a result, a large fraction of government revenue and foreign currency inflows to the country are required to be channelled for debt service payments, permitting little leeway for productive investments. Since 1994, revenue and grants have not been sufficient to meet at least recurrent expenditure of the Government, necessitating government borrowings to cover recurrent expenses that generally do not contribute to future growth and",

Blanchard (2004) also asserts that inflation targeting only through monetary policy may not be successful in a high debt environment. The monetary authority\u2019s attempt to raise the real interest rate with the aim of maintaining inflation at a targeted rate may aggravate debt levels through increased borrowing costs, if the fiscal authority is disinclined for fiscal consolidation. Moreover, rising debt levels could intensify sovereign default risk and exert exchange rate depreciation pressure, and thereby result in higher inflation instead of lower inflation. Therefore, Blanchard (2004) emphasises that in a high debt environment, inflation should be managed through fiscal policy by attempting to reduce fiscal deficits, and thereby government debt levels, instead of only using monetary policy to combat inflation. Meanwhile, some academics have argued that inflation and financial repression1",

Therefore, at this critical juncture, the objective of attaining macroeconomic stability by resolving the macroeconomic imbalances supersedes the objective of achieving near term higher growth. Contrary to the traditional Keynesian view, recent studies have also indicated the possibility of offsetting contractionary effects of fiscal consolidation, when the fiscal consolidation is large and perceived to be credible by the public, especially when public debt levels are high (Giavazzi & Pagano, 1990). On one hand, private consumption could increase if households perceive there is a permanent reduction in the government borrowing requirement when the Government is committed to achieving fiscal consolidation. Such a reduction in government borrowings implies lower taxes in future and thus, a higher lifetime income for the households, encouraging them to increase their consumption from the current period. On the other hand, a reduction in government borrowing requirements will reduce inflation risk premia and default risk premia associated with public debt issuances due to lower inflation expectations and fewer economic uncertainties. This will lead to a fall in real interest rates and promote more productive private investment. As such, given the serious macroeconomic imbalances emanating from weak fiscal conditions, well-planned fiscal consolidation measures are more likely to be beneficial for the Sri Lankan economy, particularly to ensure macroeconomic stability and growth in the medium to long term. However, it is crucial that Sri Lanka implements the optimal combination of consolidation strategies to minimise possible contractionary effects in the short term and thereby avert fiscal austerity being a \u2018self-defeating\u2019 strategy.",

Accordingly, as a result of attempts for fiscal consolidation, a country\u2019s fiscal performance may even deteriorate further due to lower revenue collection and lower nominal GDP following the slowdown in economic growth. Hence, as the economic growth of the country has already been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, fiscal consolidation during the pandemic period itself may be a greater concern for policymakers.

However, given the low tax revenue to GDP ratio, Sri Lanka still has space for manoeuvring fiscal consolidation through revenue policies with minimal disruptions on output. Successful revenue based fiscal consolidation measures in other countries, such as in Brazil, Canada, Finland, New Zealand, and South Africa, have focused on broadening the tax base and introducing reforms to simplify tax administration (Okwuokei, 2014). Since raising indirect tax rates such as Value Added Tax (VAT) could disproportionately affect consumption of low income households during these hard times, widening the VAT base (increasing the number of VAT paying businesses) would be the appropriate option to augment government revenue while minimising output and distributional effects. In this regard, the VAT free threshold could be revised downwards to the levels that prevailed prior to the last VAT threshold adjustment.3 Meanwhile, considering the modest impact on economic growth, taxes on capital income could be raised at the personal level.",

    "text": "Past experiences of other countries suggest that fiscal austerity through expenditure reduction is more successful since expenditure cuts reflect greater commitment of the Government and efficiency gains (Price, 2010). Although a reduction in wages and transfers are proven to be more effective in fiscal consolidation in other countries, such a move will not be an easy feat in the Sri Lankan context given the associated political cost and stringent labour market conditions. Hence, at least, new government recruitments and major public wage revisions should be considered with caution along with better targeting of subsidies. On the other hand, the reduction in capital expenditure and expenditure on health and education could create more contractionary effects both in the short and long term, especially due to the country\u2019s deficiencies in physical and soft infrastructure. Therefore, fiscal consolidation through sizeable capital expenditure cuts should be achieved through \u2018value for money\u2019 strategies, instead of across the board expense cuts. In this regard, the Central Government as well as local government authorities should streamline capital expenditure by selecting infrastructure projects that generate the highest economic value and future growth potential. Moreover, streamlining and digitalising",

Since the debt burden of inefficient, loss-making State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs) translates into contingent liabilities of the Government, reforms related to SOBEs should be expeditiously implemented in tandem with fiscal austerity. Cost-reflective pricing mechanisms, institutional restructuring for efficiency gains, and market-oriented product and service delivery are several overdue reforms related to SOBEs. In addition, legislative and administrative reforms are required to monitor the progress of fiscal consolidation, strengthen public scrutiny over the consolidation process, and ensure accountability of the policymakers and government officials for meeting austerity targets. It may be noted that the continuous reliance of major SOBEs on the two state banks, and eventually on central bank financing, has created numerous challenges to price stability. Hence, SOBEs should be held accountable for their operations and such entities should not pass their debt burden on commercial banks and the Central Bank.",
