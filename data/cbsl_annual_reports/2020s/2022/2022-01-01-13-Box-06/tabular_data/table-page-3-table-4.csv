Impact on National Security
The  existence  of  informal  channels  is  a  challenge  for 
national  security  agencies  since  several  large  terrorist 
attacks in the world have been partially funded by such 
channels.  Hawala  is  a  form  of  underground  banking 
method, which is considered a threat to the effectiveness

be made to stop expanding these channels and to stop 
terrorists using Hawala channels.
Sri Lanka and Hawala Channels
The Growth of Informal Money Transfer Channels
It  has  been  observed  that  workersâ€™  remittances  in  Sri 
Lanka fell notably in 2021 mainly due to fewer worker 
departures  for  foreign  countries  during  the  pandemic 
and  the  expansion  of  Hawala  channels  due  to  large 
exchange  rate  differentials  between  the  formal  market 
and 
the  grey  market.  Migrant  workers  have  been 
incentivised to switch to Hawala channels by the premium 
in  2021  negatively  affected  the  BOP  position  in  Sri 
Lanka.  It  has  been  reported  that  Sri  Lankan  importers 
too  use  Hawala  channels 
because  of  the  shortage  of  foreign  currency  supply  in 
formal channels arising from exchange rate differentials 
even  though  the  use  of  Hawala  channels  to  obtain 
foreign  currency  is  expensive.  Overall,  the  popularity 
of  Hawala  channels  in  recent  times  has  deprived  the 
country from receiving crucial flows of foreign currency 
through  formal  channels,  thus  dampening  the  supply 
of  foreign  exchange,  and  shrinking  foreign  currency 
reserves  creating  BOP  concerns.  Thus,  the  expansion 
of  Hawala  channels  poses  a  significant  threat  to  the 
BOP position in Sri Lanka.  However, if formal channels 
can continuously maintain a competitive exchange rate 
based  on  market  demand  and  supply,  the  demand 
for 
informal 
contained, as the exchange rate differential is expected 
to reduce substantially.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
