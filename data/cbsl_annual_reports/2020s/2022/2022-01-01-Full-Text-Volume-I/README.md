1.1 OverviewT

he Sri Lankan economy recovered in 2021 from the pandemic induced contraction in 2020, albeit

with several deeply entrenched structural problems and vulnerabilities inherited over several

decades coming to the forefront, thereby resulting in unprecedented socio-political tensions in

early 2022. The economy was already in a fragile state lacking the necessary buffers to withstand shocks,

when it was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and other multifaceted headwinds that emanated from the

global and domestic fronts. Such vulnerability of the economy can be mainly attributed to the lack of fiscal

space, which was further constrained by the changes introduced to the tax structure in late 2019. Sri Lanka

was not an exception in the world in deploying countermeasures to face the pandemic and safeguard the

economy to forestall a lasting economic fallout and scarring effects on livelihoods. However, given particular

vulnerabilities in the economy, the Central Bank had to be heavily involved in shielding the economy through

extraordinary responses, in the form of monetary policy easing, ample liquidity provision to the markets

and the Government, and adopting several external sector and financial sector policies, in the absence of

adequate policy space in the fiscal sector or an adequately prompt response from the fiscal sector. The

ultra easy macroeconomic policy package unveiled by the Central Bank and the Government helped the

economic recovery in 2021 from the historical contraction recorded in 2020, while also helping cushion the

impact of the pandemic on a broader segment of the stakeholders. Both public and private sectors enjoyed

the comfort of low cost funds for working capital and investment that helped them stay afloat during this

difficult time, and keep industries viable, even witnessing some growth, which in turn ensured uninterrupted

provision of public services, utilities and goods and services to the public as well as other essential supply

chains. However, unprecedented policy responses taken during the peak of the pandemic together with the

inability to withdraw the policy measures due to expected fiscal responses not coming through adequately,

caused a limited space for reversal measures and led to some unintended effects on macroeconomic

stability in 2021, which were further aggravated in early 2022. Further, the pressures witnessed on the

exchange rate amidst dried up liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market were amplified in 2021 and

early 2022, warranting a measured adjustment that was allowed in the exchange rate in early March 2022,

compared to the level that prevailed in the market amidst concerns about the adverse impact of any large

depreciation of the exchange rate on the society. However, the outcome of the exchange rate flexibility that

was thereafter allowed also in early March 2022, fell short of expectations due to the large overshooting by

market forces, reflecting the significant liquidity pressures that prevailed in the domestic foreign exchange

market as well as the delay in market correction.

Price stability, which was the strongest pillar for macroeconomic stability over the last decade or so,

was challenged since the second half of 2021 due to the combined impact of global and local supply

driven causes as well as the build-up of excessive demand pressures on prices, primarily caused by the

lagged impact of extraordinary monetary accommodation, including unprecedented monetary financing that

became required due to the lack of fiscal space. Moreover, the external sector remained on the brink of a

precarious state since late 2021 due to the mounting Balance of Payments (BOP) pressures reflected in

the meagre level of official reserves amidst significant debt servicing obligations along with the dire need

to finance essential imports at a time when the domestic foreign exchange market remained largely illiquid.

Calamities in the power and energy sector, acute shortages of essentials and raw materials and the spillover

effects of these on every nook and cranny of the economy could disrupt economic activity excessively

unless resolved urgently. The actions and policy measures taken on a piecemeal basis to fix or postpone

these severe conditions have proven to be unsuccessful or created novel issues. Any notable intervention

by fiscal authorities to ease these domestic economic conditions to restore normalcy remained a remote

possibility due to historically high public debt levels, further weakening of fiscal balances and extremely low

sovereign rating. As a result, the Central Bank took swift measures in early April 2022 to preempt further

deterioration of macroeconomic stability and to restore price stability through a significant tightening of

monetary policy, among others. These policy initiatives would be imperative to commence bold structural

reforms to revitalise medium to long term macroeconomic stability, which remains a necessary condition for

long term inclusive growth.

In this regard, the implementation of several structural reforms is vital at this juncture by the Government

to complement the Central Bank’s remedial policies. Implementing strong fiscal adjustments, which have

been long delayed and often reversed in the past, will lead to a visible turnaround in the current complex

economic turmoil. Sustainable containment of the budget deficit through an upward level shift to government

revenue along with the rationalisation and prioritisation of government expenditure would help contain the

expansion of government borrowing going forward. Further, a comprehensive and coherent approach

to achieving and maintaining public debt sustainability is a must to take any step forward in addressing

the current economic problem. These essential fiscal adjustments have to be supported by financially

independent and autonomous State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs) by introducing, among others,

cost reflective pricing structures, institutionalisation of good governance and accountability mechanisms,

notable productivity enhancement and service delivery in the overall public sector, and strengthening of well

targeted social safety net schemes. While it is necessary to strengthen legal frameworks to ensure public

accountability of state institutions, exercising existing legal powers in policy formulation and implementation

by relevant authorities would ensure lasting economic welfare in the country. These changes would ensure

increased participation of the private sector with ease, while the public sector continues to play a facilitator

role in the economy.

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

The persistent twin deficit dilemma experienced by Sri Lanka highlights the importance of addressing

the BOP issues on a sustainable basis. National policies, which are free from changing political regimes,

formed with the support of relevant stakeholders aiming at reducing the external current account deficit

and budget deficit to a manageable level are imperative in this endeavour. Further, other non debt creating

foreign exchange generating sources need to be explored and established to build-up official reserves,

while reducing the need for external debt financing of the BOP. A conducive doing business environment

and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) promotions must supplement this external sector stabilisation package.

Recent events experienced in Sri Lanka reveal how macroeconomic stability, social cohesion and political

stability are intertwined and how the effect of one aspect could spillover to another. Thus, the overall solution

to the prevailing triple plights, i.e., economic turmoil, social unrest, and political instability, should cover all

these elements to reboot Sri Lanka to new heights. The ongoing efforts to resolve the economic issues,

including the suspension of external debt servicing by the Government for an interim period pending orderly

and consensual restructuring of debt obligations, seeking an economic adjustment programme from the

International Monetary Fund (IMF), a commitment to rationalising government expenditure and enhancing

government revenue, and continuing non aligned political and economic diplomacy, among others, are

expected to restore macroeconomic stability in the period ahead. The overall success of these efforts is

conditional on reassuring social coherence and restoring political stability and an enduring political will, to

take this reform agenda forward.

1.2 Macroeconomic Developments in 2021

Real Sector Developments and Inflation

The Sri Lankan economy rebounded in 2021,

following the COVID-19 induced contraction

in 2020. As per the provisional national accounts

estimates of the Department of Census and Statistics

(DCS), the Sri Lankan economy recorded a growth

of 3.7 per cent in 2021, in real terms, compared to the

contraction of 3.6 per cent recorded in the preceding

year. All sectors of the economy registered growth

during the year (agriculture, forestry and fishing by

2.0 per cent; industry by 5.3 per cent; and services

by 3.0 per cent). The performance of the agriculture,

forestry and fishing sector was buoyed by the

notable growth recorded in the subcategories of

growing of cereals (except rice), oleaginous fruits,

and tea, while the contraction in the growing of rice

and other beverage crops weighed negatively on the

sectoral performance. The majority of subcategories

within the industries sector registered robust growth.

A notable exception was manufacturing activities

related to coke and refined petroleum products

which recorded a contraction of 30.5 per cent due

to occasional refinery shutdowns during the year.

All subcategories in the services sector registered

growth with IT programming, consultancy, and

related activities, and the telecommunications

sectors recording sizeable growth of 21.7 per cent

and 16.2 per cent, respectively, highlighting the

increased usage of telecommunications services

amid the pandemic and growth in the Information

Technology/ Business Process Outsourcing (IT/

BPO) sector. The taxes less subsidies component

of GDP grew by 4.9 per cent in 2021 driven by

improvements in tax revenues, when compared to

2020, in line with the post COVID-19 recovery in

economic activity and declines in subsidies.

In nominal terms, the Sri Lankan economy

recorded a notable growth of 11.9 per cent in

2021, compared to the tepid expansion of 0.2 per

cent observed in 2020. Accordingly, the overall size

of the economy expanded to US dollars 84.5 billion in

2021 from US dollars 81.0 billion in the previous year.

Per capita GDP grew to US dollars 3,815 in 2021

from US dollars 3,695 in 2020. On the expenditure

front, final consumption expenditure recorded a

significant growth of 9.9 per cent at current prices in

2021, compared to the relatively modest growth of

2.0 per cent seen in 2020. This growth was largely

driven by household consumption expenditure which

grew by 10.8 per cent during the year, compared to

just 1.0 per cent growth during the previous year.

However, government consumption expenditure at

current prices grew at a relatively modest pace of

3.7 per cent in 2021, compared to the growth of 9.9

per cent that was observed in 2020. The share of

consumption expenditure in GDP at current prices

stood at 79.9 per cent in 2021. Meanwhile, gross

domestic capital formation registered a growth of

23.2 per cent in 2021, compared to the contractions

recorded in both 2020 and 2019. The share of

gross capital formation in nominal GDP improved

marginally to 27.7 per cent in 2021. Net external

demand for goods and services deteriorated sharply,

registering a decline of 31.6 per cent in 2021 with

the growth in imports outweighing the growth in

exports. While a rise in private savings led to a

notable growth of 20.3 per cent in domestic savings,

the low government revenue led to an increase in

government dissavings. Accordingly, domestic

savings as a percentage of GDP stood at 20.1 per

cent in 2021, compared to 18.7 per cent in 2020.

The domestic savings-investment gap widened

to -7.6 per cent of GDP in 2021, compared to

-6.4 per cent of GDP in 2020. The national

savings-investment gap widened from -1.6 per cent

of GDP in 2020 to -3.9 per cent of GDP in 2021,

driven by the growth in investment expenditure.

While the steady recovery of the economy

led to the decline in the unemployment rate, the

increase in both the labour force and inactive

population led to a decline in labour force

participation during the year. The unemployment

rate declined to 5.1 per cent in 2021 from the

5.5 per cent recorded during the previous year.

Unemployment rates amongst males and females

also followed suit, declining to 3.7 per cent and

7.9 per cent, respectively, in 2021, from 4.0 per cent

and 8.5 per cent, respectively, in 2020. Meanwhile,

the economically inactive population increased by

3.7 per cent to 8.6 million in 2021, compared to 2020

with dampened interest in active job search and

pandemic induced hardships on usual routines. This

development, alongside the marginal increase of

1.0 per cent in the labour force resulted in a decline

in the overall labour force participation rate (LFPR)

to 49.9 per cent in 2021 compared to 50.6 per cent

in 2020. LFPR of both males and females declined

from 71.9 per cent and 32.0 per cent,

respectively, in 2020, to 71.0 per cent and

31.8 per cent, respectively, in 2021. The

agriculture, industry, and services sectors

accounted for 27.3 per cent, 26.0 per cent, and

46.7 per cent of the total employment, respectively.

Headline inflation accelerated in 2021 driven

mainly by global and domestic supply side

disturbances, the surge in global commodity

prices and upward revisions to administered

prices, while core inflation also accelerated

reflecting the lagged effect of significant monetary

accommodation. As reflected by the year-on-year

change in both the National Consumer Price Index

(NCPI, 2013=100) and the Colombo Consumer Price

Index (CCPI, 2013=100), the acceleration in headline

inflation was attributed to the acceleration in both food

and non food inflation, though food inflation accounted

for a larger share. Several upward revisions made to

energy prices and other administrative prices reflected

the rise in prices in the international market as well as

volatile food prices stemming from the pandemic related

supply side disruptions and the loss of production of

certain items, mostly contributed to such acceleration

in inflation. Spillover of the aforementioned revisions

alongside external shock absorption methods, such

as the removal of maximum retail prices also partly

contributed to the rise in inflation. Accordingly, year-

on-year headline inflation, as measured by the CCPI,

which was recorded at 4.2 per cent at end 2020,

accelerated to 12.1 per cent by end 2021, breaching

the target level of 4-6 per cent. Following a similar

trend, year-on-year headline inflation, based on the

NCPI, also accelerated and was recorded at 14.0

per cent by end 2021, compared to 4.6 per cent at

end 2020. The upward trend of headline inflation has

continued thus far in 2022. Accordingly, year-on-year

headline inflation based on the CCPI accelerated

to 18.7 per cent in March 2022, while that of NCPI

also accelerated to 21.5 per cent in March 2022.

Core inflation, which measures underlying demand

pressures, also accelerated sharply from mid 2021,

reflecting demand driven inflationary pressures

triggered by the impact of the lagged effects of

pandemic related significant monetary policy

accommodation. Accordingly, year-on-year core

inflation, based on the CCPI accelerated to 8.3 per

cent by end 2021 from 3.5 per cent recorded at end

2020. NCPI based core inflation accelerated to 10.8

per cent, year-on-year, by end 2021 in comparison to

4.7 per cent at end 2020. Further, continuing the same

trend, CCPI based year-on-year core inflation rose to

13.0 per cent by March 2022, while NCPI based year-

on-year core inflation rose to 17.3 per cent by March

2022. The strong proactive policy measures taken

by the Central Bank are expected to arrest further

build-up of demand driven inflationary pressures and

adverse inflation expectations, supporting to revert

inflation rates towards the target range in the period

ahead.

External Sector Developments

Sri Lanka’s external sector continues to

face numerous challenges, including a sharp

widening of the current account deficit, limited

inflows to the financial account, depletion of

gross official reserves (GOR) as a result of large

debt servicing requirements and significant

depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee. Regardless

of the notable momentum in merchandise exports

compared to the previous year, a high increase in

merchandise imports, which outpaced the growth

in exports, widened the trade deficit in 2021.

Increased import expenditure was mainly due to

the combined effect of sharp revival in imports,

particularly in the latter part of the year, primarily

driven by higher commodity prices, including

prices of fuel, increased demand for imported

items due to normalisation of economic activity,

higher importation of medical and pharmaceutical

items such as vaccines, and the relaxation of

some of the restrictions on importation of non

essential goods. The services sector surplus

remained subdued, compared to the pre-pandemic

level. However, there was a gradual increase in

earnings from tourism towards the end of the year

whilst a healthy growth was observed in exports

of computer services. The deficit in the primary

income account recorded a contraction with a

reduction in interest and coupon payments as well

as dividend payments. Meanwhile, the surplus in

the secondary income account reduced as a result

of a notable contraction in workers’ remittances

received by the banking system. With these

developments, the deficit in the external current

account widened significantly to US dollars 3.3

billion in 2021 (4.0 per cent of GDP), compared

to US dollars 1.2 billion in 2020 (1.5 per cent of

GDP). The financing of the current account deficit

was achieved by drawing down GOR amidst

moderate inflows to the financial account and

continuous foreign debt service payments. Foreign

investment in the form of FDI remained modest

while foreign investment to the stock market and

the government securities market recorded net

outflows during the year. Amidst significant debt

servicing obligations falling due during the year, the

Government and the Central Bank received some

inflows that enabled replenishment of the GOR

to a certain extent. These included the Special

Drawing Rights (SDR) allocation by the IMF, two

foreign currency term financing facilities from

the China Development Bank, and international

currency swap agreements with the People’s

Bank of China (PBOC) and the Bangladesh Bank.

However, there were substantial outflows from

official reserves due to debt service payments

as well as the supply of foreign exchange to the

domestic foreign exchange market to facilitate

the importation of essential goods. As a result,

the GOR declined to US dollars 3.1 billion by end

2021, compared to US dollars 5.7 billion recorded

as of end 2020. Accordingly, the overall balance

of the BOP recorded a significant deficit of around

US dollars 4.0 billion in 2021. Meanwhile, the

total external debt of the Government, based

on market value, declined marginally as a result

of the combined effect of the decline in market

prices of Sri Lanka’s outstanding International

Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) and the repayment of

an ISB, although the outstanding foreign loans of

the Government recorded an increase during the

year. Further, the outstanding external liabilities

of the Central Bank increased significantly due

to the net impact of international currency swap

arrangements. Consequently, Sri Lanka’s total

external debt increased to US dollars 50.7 billion

by end 2021 from US dollars 49.0 billion as of

end 2020. Sri Lanka settled the ISB of US dollars

1 billion that matured in July 2021 and the ISB

of US dollars 500 million that matured in January

2022. The Sri Lanka rupee was maintained

broadly at stable levels during 2021 and in early

2022, partially aided by moral suasion to keep the

currency stable around Rs. 200 levels. However,

considering the severity of the external shocks

and further adverse developments in the global

and domestic fronts, the Central Bank allowed

flexibility in the exchange rate, yet intending to keep

the rate of depreciation at a certain level, since

early March 2022 as a part of the comprehensive

policy package announced to alleviate the difficult

situation in the external sector. However, the

large pressures witnessed in the domestic foreign

exchange market caused a large overshoot in the

Sri Lanka rupee. Consequently, the Sri Lanka

rupee, which depreciated by 7.0 per cent in 2021,

depreciated significantly by 33.0 per cent by end

March 2022. The Government and the Central Bank

have identified the need for implementing urgent

measures to address external sector vulnerabilities

and for such measures to complement broader

economic reforms aimed at resolving persistent

and long-standing issues in the economy. While

many regional countries and institutions have

assisted the country with numerous credit lines,

international swap facilities, syndicated loans and

substantial current and capital grants, the country

is seeking an effective engagement with the IMF

and other external stakeholders in order to ensure

the sustainability of the country’s external debt for

restoring macroeconomic stability.

Fiscal Sector Developments

Fiscal sector performance, which suffers

from chronically high structural budget deficits

caused by government expenditure overruns

and government revenue slippages over

the years, has deteriorated in 2021, further

escalating the government debt stock. The fiscal

strategy outlined in the Budget 2021 was aimed at

ensuring macroeconomic stability while enhancing

economic revival and poverty alleviation, although

the envisaged fiscal outcomes were off the mark

during 2021 as a result of overly optimistic fiscal

targets, prominently in relation to government

revenue, which was not adequately supported

by felicitous fiscal policies. Government revenue

declined to a historic low level of 8.7 per cent of

GDP in 2021 as against 9.1 per cent of GDP in

2020. Actual revenue collection significantly

deviated from the original budget estimate of 11.1

per cent of GDP, owing to the loss of revenue

flows which was a result of the tax relaxations

implemented in late 2019 and early 2020, slower

than expected economic revival, as well as the

continuation of some import restrictions. However,

in nominal terms, government revenue recorded

a moderate growth of 6.5 per cent, year-on-year.

Income taxes, Value Added Tax (VAT), Ports and

Airports Development Levy (PAL) and CESS levy

contributed to the nominal growth in government

revenue, although the revenue mobilised through

import duty, excise duty and Special Commodity

Levy (SCL) declined primarily due to import

restrictions. The rate of growth in government

revenue failed to keep pace with the rate of growth in

national income in 2021, as in the past, mainly due

to the continuation of a plethora of tax incentives

introduced since late 2019 and additional direct and

indirect concessionary tax reforms introduced since

the onset of the pandemic and under the Budget

2021. On the other hand, government expenditure,

in nominal terms, increased by 15.8 per cent,

year-on-year, to Rs. 3,521.7 billion in 2021.

Accordingly, government expenditure as a

percentage of GDP increased to 21.0 per cent in

2021 from 20.2 per cent in 2020. Higher expenditure

on salaries and wages and interest expenses,

which stood at 11.3 per cent of GDP in 2021 and

130.0 per cent of government revenue, drove the

growth in recurrent expenditure. Moreover, capital

expenditure and net lending increased by 57.2 per

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

1Background

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an organisation established in 1944 to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world. The IMF usually provides loans under its programmes to member countries that experience Balance of Payments (BOP) problems to support rebuilding international reserves, stabilising currencies, ensuring continuity in payments for imports, and restoring economic growth, while correcting underlying problems. All IMF members are eligible to access IMF’s resources in the General Resources Account (GRA) on non concessional terms, and the IMF also provides concessional financial support through the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), which is tailored to the diversity and needs of low-income countries. For emerging and advanced market economies in crises, IMF assistance is provided through Stand-By Arrangements (SBAs) to address short term or potential BOP problems. The Stand-By Credit Facility (SCF) serves a similar purpose for low-income countries. The Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the corresponding Extended Credit Facility (ECF) for low-income countries are the main facilities aimed at providing medium term support to countries facing protracted BOP problems. To help prevent or mitigate crises and boost market confidence, members with already strong policies can use the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) or the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL). The Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) and the corresponding Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) for low-income countries provide rapid assistance to countries with urgent BOP needs, including difficulties posed by commodity price shocks, natural disasters, and domestic fragilities. Objectives, policies and conditionality under an IMF funding arrangement depend on a country’s specific economic circumstances.

The prime concern often raised with regard to approaching the IMF for a programme is the conditionalities attached to it. Conditionalities in IMF programmes in general cover key macroeconomic and structural policy adjustments. Even though these conditionalities were largely focused on macroeconomic policies until the early 1980s, the complexity and scope of structural conditions increased subsequently, reflecting the IMF’s growing involvement in low-income and transitional countries. These conditionalities are intended to help countries resolve BOP problems, while avoiding recurring instances of such problems. Further, the remedial measures are intended to ensure that the country’s BOP will be strong enough to meet payments for imports and to service external debt in a sustained manner.

The policy commitments agreed with country authorities generally include:

Prior Actions (PA): These are the steps a country agrees to take before the IMF approves financing under a

BOX 1The Importance of International Monetary Fund Programmes

programme. Such actions are set out to ensure that a country has the required foundation to achieve programme goals successfully. PA may generally include the elimination of price controls (if any), formulation of the government budget in consistence with the medium term fiscal framework, and taking measures to achieve debt sustainability.

Quantitative Performance Criteria (QPC): These are specific, measurable conditions relating to macroeconomic variables under the control of the authorities, such as monetary and credit aggregates, international reserves, fiscal balances, and external borrowing. QPC may generally include a minimum level of government primary balance, a ceiling on government borrowing, and a minimum level of international reserves.

Indicative Targets (IT): IT may be set for quantitative indicators to assess progress in meeting programme objectives. IT are sometimes set instead of QPC because of uncertainty about economic trends. As uncertainty is reduced, these targets may become QPC, with appropriate modifications. IT may generally include a minimum level of the government primary balance, a minimum level of domestic revenue collection, and a minimum level of social assistance spending.

Structural Benchmarks (SB): These are reform measures that often are non quantifiable but are critical for achieving programme goals. SB may generally include improvements in financial sector operations, building up social safety nets, and strengthening public financial management.

The Success of IMF Programmes in Terms of Fulfilling Conditions

The IMF periodically reviews the performance of its programmes. An IMF programme is designed in such a way that disbursements of funds are conditional on meeting QPC, IT, etc. To improve the programme’s success and reduce risks, the IMF recommends measures to improve the practicality of projections, sharpen debt sustainability analysis, enhance the quality of fiscal consolidation, and improve the tailoring of structural conditions. For the RCF and the RFI facilities provided by the IMF, there is no ex-post programme based conditionality or reviews except for limited overall conditionality. If a country fails to meet QPC, the IMF Executive Board may approve a waiver if it is satisfied that the programme will still succeed, provided that the deviation is minor/temporary or national authorities are taking corrective actions. Missed structural benchmarks and indicative targets do not require waivers but are assessed in the context of overall programme performance.

History of Sri Lanka's Relationship with the IMF

Sri Lanka has engaged in sixteen IMF programmes since obtaining membership of the IMF in 1950. Sri Lanka’s first IMF programme was in 1965 and the last was in 2016. The most successful IMF programme was the SBA which commenced in 2009, in which the IMF disbursed the full allocation of funds to Sri Lanka. The previous IMF programmes concentrated primarily on improving foreign reserves and the conduct of monetary policy. In addition, there was emphasis on undertaking vital structural reforms that included the introduction of a fuel price formula, improving the Central Bank’s independence, a flexible exchange rate policy, and revenue based fiscal consolidation. In the Sri Lankan context, for official dealings with the IMF, the Hon. Minister of Finance holds the capacity of the Governor of the IMF, and the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) holds the capacity of the Alternate Governor of the IMF.

In addition, the IMF has extended many technical assistance opportunities to the CBSL and to the Government, including the Forecasting and Policy Analysis System (FPAS) model that was aimed at improving the technical capacity of the CBSL in its transition to the flexible inflation targeting framework.

The Overall Success of IMF Programmes in Sri Lanka

Despite being part of many programmes since the first in 1965, only a few IMF programmes in Sri Lanka have been successfully implemented by authorities. This has been mainly due to the lack of commitment in meeting the conditionalities attached to such programmes, especially those related to structural reforms, which required painful macroeconomic adjustments and unpopular policies that were aimed at

long term productivity improvements in the economy. Notably, the need to seek external assistance is a result of the failure to take initiative as a country to introduce structural reforms, which are often included in IMF programmes as well. Most reforms identified in the previous IMF programmes have not been completed fully or abandoned abruptly after drawing some disbursements under the financing facilities, while meeting only short term objectives. This has led to a cycle of being in and out of IMF programmes frequently as shown in Table B 1.1. In contrast, India, which obtained seven programmes from the IMF during 1951 to 1993, has not approached the IMF since the conclusion of its last programme in 1993. If an IMF programme is completed successfully, the economy would be able to reap the long term benefits, especially through structural adjustments, and the need to approach the IMF on future occasions of short term economic stresses would have been minimal. A summary of the success of the latest IMF programmes extended in 2009 and 2016 to Sri Lanka in terms of fulfilling the conditionalities is as follows.

IMF-SBA Programme in 2009

As per the IMF staff report for the eighth and final review under the SBA, Sri Lanka fulfilled the net international reserve targets, net domestic financing and reserve money indicative targets related to the programme. Sri Lanka also implemented all structural benchmarks, except the proposed reforms to the regulatory framework for private pension funds prior to the expiration of the programme.

IMF-EFF Programme in 2016

As per the IMF staff report for the sixth review under the EFF, Sri Lanka was unable to meet fiscal targets due to the significant revenue shortfalls after

Implications of a Future IMF Programme on Sri Lanka

As previously mentioned, Sri Lanka has entered into IMF programmes from time to time to support the BOP position and the Government’s reforms agenda. However, unlike in previous occasions, in the current context, an IMF programme will be an important part of strategies to overcome prevailing challenging economic conditions in the country. Considering the current low level of international reserves, servicing the significantly high debt repayments due in the near term will be extremely challenging. Liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market has dried up amidst high foreign debt service payments and the reduction in foreign exchange inflows, resulting in significant depletion of gross official reserves and inadequate foreign exchange to meet the forex demands for essential imports, such as fuel, gas, coal, medicine, and essential food items. In this context, there is a need for securing a sizeable amount of foreign financing in the immediate future. Entering into an IMF programme would not only provide access to additional financing but would also enhance the confidence of potential foreign investors, including multilateral and bilateral counterparts. This, coupled with the implementation of a macroeconomic policy package, is expected to stabilise the overall macroeconomy which will further promote non debt creating financial inflows.

Major areas that could be expected to be considered in the discussion of a potential IMF programme could include fiscal consolidation, appropriate monetary policy stance, exchange rate flexibility, phasing out of monetary financing, reforms of SOBEs, the gradual unwinding of capital flow management measures, the introduction of market based pricing formulae for utilities and strengthening social safety nets, among others. Some of the aforementioned measures have been already implemented by the CBSL and the Government. The monetary policy has been significantly tightened,

the exchange rate is increasingly being determined by market forces, and adjustments to prices of domestic petroleum and LP gas have been allowed to reflect costs. These macroeconomic stabilisation measures could result in a painful adjustment to the economy in the adjustment stage, but it has become imperative considering the current economic crisis. However, in order to successfully implement an IMF programme, the country should ensure the management of external debt sustainably through appropriate measures. Towards this end, the Government has already announced the suspension of external debt servicing for an interim period pending an orderly and consensual restructuring of debt obligations in a manner consistent with an economic adjustment programme supported by the IMF. Further, political and social stability needs to be achieved through an agreement between all relevant stakeholders to successfully negotiate and implement an IMF programme. The success of this will also rest on the extent to which the long neglected structural reforms are implemented in a way that ensures sustainable macroeconomic stability.

cent, year-on-year, due to the base effect, although

public investment declined by 2.7 per cent in 2021.

The expenditure rationalisation plan was derailed

with rigid recurrent spending and additional

expenditure requirements of public health services

and direct and indirect financial support provided

to pandemic affected households and businesses.

The overall fiscal deficit, as a percentage of GDP,

worsened to 12.2 per cent (Rs. 2,057.9 billion)

in 2021 from 11.1 per cent (Rs. 1,667.7 billion)

recorded in the preceding year. Meanwhile, the

primary deficit in 2021 increased from Rs. 687.4

billion (4.6 per cent of the GDP) in 2020 to Rs.

1,009.5 billion (6.0 per cent of the GDP) in 2021,

highlighting the inadequacy of government revenue

to meet at least non interest expenditure of the

year. The current account deficit, which reflects

the dissavings of the Government, also widened in

nominal terms from Rs. 1,180.4 billion in 2020 to

Rs. 1,290.4 billion in 2021, while declining

marginally to 7.7 per cent in 2021 from

7.9 per cent in the previous year, as a percentage

of the GDP. With these developments, the primary

deficit, current account deficit, and overall budget

deficit, as percentages of GDP, notably deviated

from the respective estimates of 4.0 per cent,

2.9 per cent, and 8.9 per cent, set out in the

Budget 2021. Amidst limited access to foreign

financial markets resulting from the adverse global

developments and sovereign rating downgrades,

the Government relied heavily on domestic

sources, especially the banking sector, to finance

the budget deficit. Accordingly, during 2021, net

financing through domestic sources amounted to

Rs. 2,071.8 billion, whereas a net repayment of

Rs. 13.9 billion was registered in relation to foreign

sources. The Government relied on financing from

the banking sector on a large scale, especially from

the Central Bank, to meet the rising expenditure

requirements and debt servicing obligations in

2021. As a result, the Central Bank accounted for

Rs. 1,225.2 billion of domestic bank borrowings of

the Government in 2021. The wider fiscal deficit,

increased market interest rates, as well as parity

losses caused by the depreciation of the Sri Lanka

rupee, resulted in an increase in outstanding

central government debt from Rs. 15,117.2 billion

recorded at end 2020 to Rs. 17,589.4 billion by end

2021. Accordingly, outstanding central government

debt, as a percentage of GDP, increased to 104.6

per cent by end 2021 from 100.6 per cent registered

at the end of the preceding year. In nominal terms,

domestic debt and foreign debt increased by 22.4

per cent and 7.3 per cent, respectively, by end 2021

over 2020. The increased domestic borrowings

from Treasury bills and Treasury bonds resulted

in the share of domestic debt in the government

debt portfolio to rise from 60.0 per cent in 2020 to

63.1 per cent in 2021. The total debt service

payments increased from Rs. 1,941.4 billion in

2020 to Rs. 2,375.6 billion in 2021. Accordingly,

debt service payments increased to 14.1 per

cent of GDP in 2021 from 12.9 per cent of GDP

in the preceding year. In 2021, interest payments

and capital payments amounted to 6.2 per cent

and 7.9 per cent of GDP, respectively. A series

of sovereign rating downgrades for Sri Lanka

was exercised by rating agencies during 2021,

in consideration of its worsened external liquidity

position, weakening fiscal outlook and forthcoming

substantial debt service payments. The significantly

high debt level of the Government and bunching

of foreign debt obligations in the near to medium

term raised serious concerns about external debt

sustainability of the country. Against this backdrop,

the already announced efforts of the Government

to restructure the debt portfolio, along with a strong

commitment towards fiscal consolidation efforts

and prudent liability management strategies are

expected to restore public debt sustainability in the

period ahead.

Monetary Sector Developments

Considering the possible build-up of

excessive inflationary pressures and the

imbalances that emerged in the external sector

and financial markets, the Central Bank, which

deployed unprecedented monetary stimulus

measures since 2020, commenced monetary

tightening measures in mid-August 2021. The

extremely accommodative monetary policy stance,

which was maintained by the Central Bank from the

onset of the pandemic in early 2020 through mid-

August 2021, helped reduce market interest rates

to historically low levels and provide adequate

liquidity to the domestic money market, thereby

helping individuals and businesses affected by the

pandemic, while facilitating economic recovery. The

Central Bank continued to provide extraordinary

financial support to the Government by way of

purchasing Treasury bills from the primary market,

as well as direct allocations to the Central Bank

to meet the emergency funding needs of the

Government amidst disruptions to its cashflows

resulting from low revenue mobilisation and high

expenditure during the pandemic. However, to

preempt the build-up of excessive inflationary

pressures over the medium term and to address

imbalances in the external sector and financial

markets, measures were taken to commence

tightening the monetary policy stance from August

2021 onwards. Accordingly, the key policy interest

rates, i.e., the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR)

and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR)

were raised by 50 basis points to 5.00 per cent and

6.00 per cent, respectively, in mid-August 2021, and

the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) applicable on

all rupee deposit liabilities of Licensed Commercial

Banks (LCBs) was raised by 2 percentage points

to 4.00 per cent, effective from September 2021.

Several other regulatory measures were also

taken by the Central Bank to better reflect market

conditions. The Central Bank imposed a ceiling on

interest rates offered for foreign currency deposit

products of LCBs and National Savings Bank (NSB)

in August 2021 to address the anomalies between

interest rates of rupee and foreign currency deposits

in the market. The interest rate applicable on the

special mortgage-backed housing loan scheme

for salaried employees was revised and linked to

a variable interest rate in December 2021. With

continued challenges emanating from the external

sector and inflation fronts, the Central Bank tightened

its monetary policy stance further in January and

March 2022 by raising the SDFR and the SLFR by

150 basis points each, in total. In March 2022, the

maximum interest rate imposed on foreign currency

deposits of LCBs and NSB was also removed, while

the maximum interest rates imposed on interest

rates of domestic lending products i.e., credit cards,

pre-arranged temporary overdrafts and pawning

facilities were revised upwards. With the tightening

of the monetary policy stance and rupee liquidity

concerns encountered by certain banks, liquidity

in the domestic money market, which remained

at considerable surplus levels during the first half

of 2021, declined notably into large deficit levels.

Market interest rates, which declined to historic

low levels, started to adjust upwards gradually.

Yields on government securities were also allowed

to increase with the removal of the maximum

yield rates for acceptance at primary auctions of

government securities. In early April 2022, noting

the considerable inflationary pressures driven by

substantial exchange rate depreciation, the build-

up of aggregate demand pressures, the elevated

prices of commodities globally, and domestic supply

disruptions, the Central Bank raised policy interest

rates significantly by 700 basis points, the highest

single day adjustment in recent history, to arrest the

build-up of excessive demand driven inflationary

pressures and preempt the escalation of adverse

inflationary expectations, to provide the required

impetus to stabilise the exchange rate and also to

correct anomalies observed in the market interest

rate structure. Accordingly, the SDFR and SLFR

were increased to 13.50 per cent and 14.50 per cent,

respectively, effective from the close of business on

08 April 2022. The interest caps imposed on selected

domestic lending products were also removed.

Domestic credit extended by the banking

system expanded significantly during the year

driven mainly by the notable increase in net credit

to the Government (NCG) by the Central Bank,

while net foreign assets (NFA) of the banking

system contracted resulting in a moderation of

broad money supply (M2b). Amidst the decline in

government revenue and limited access to foreign

financing, the Government’s increased funding

requirement was met largely through the domestic

banking system. Thus, NCG by the banking system

increased notably by around Rs. 1,284.4 billion in

2021, of which, about 95 per cent was funded by

the Central Bank. Credit obtained by the SOBEs

from the banking system also expanded notably by

Rs. 185.9 billion in 2021, reflecting their weak

financial positions. Supported by the low cost of

funds, credit extended to the private sector also

expanded notably by Rs. 810.5 billion in 2021.

However, with the contraction in NFA of the banking

system, particularly NFA of the Central Bank,

due to foreign currency debt service payments by

the Central Bank on behalf of the Government,

the growth of M2b moderated towards the latter

part of 2021, recording a year-on-year growth of

13.2 per cent by end 2021, compared to the growth

of 23.4 per cent recorded at end 2020.

Financial Sector Developments

Despite severe challenges faced by the

economy, the stability of Sri Lanka’s financial

systems was preserved during the year 2021.

Financial intermediation by the banking sector was

satisfactory, while the profitability of the sector

improved considerably during 2021, compared

to the previous year, due to notable increases in

both net interest income and non-interest income.

However, banks faced a severe foreign currency

liquidity shortage due to the lack of foreign inflows to

the country. Licensed Finance Companies (LFCs)

and Specialised Leasing Companies (SLCs)

sector also showed a notable overall improvement

in terms of credit growth and profitability against

the backdrop of the progressing Financial

Sector Consolidation Masterplan. The Central

Bank continued to assist financial institutions to

adapt to the new normal and provided certain

regulatory forbearances with a view to supporting

the pandemic disrupted economy. The insurance

sector also recorded an expansion. Liquidity in

the money market turned to deficit levels followed

by foreign debt repayments and a reversal of the

accommodative monetary policy stance since

August 2021. Liquidity in the domestic foreign

exchange market was at significantly low levels

owing to a delayed recovery in tourism earnings,

slow conversion of export proceeds, increase in

import expenditure as well as unfavourable market

conditions led by several sovereign downgrades

during the year. The Colombo Stock Exchange

(CSE) recorded an improvement in 2021, despite

negligible contribution by foreign investors. The

country's payment and settlement system was

operated smoothly by the Central Bank during

the period under review. Meanwhile, the Central

Bank continued to introduce reforms to major

legislations to provide a stronger legal foundation

for the regulatory and supervisory framework.

1.3 Global Economic Environment and Outlook

As the global economy begins to recover from

the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022,

the progress is being severely disrupted by the

repercussions of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

According to the World Economic Outlook (WEO)

of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released in

April 2022, global economic growth is estimated at

6.1 per cent in 2021, compared to a contraction of 3.1

per cent in 2020. During 2021, advanced economies

were estimated to have recorded a growth of 5.2

per cent, while the growth estimation for emerging

market and developing economies stood at 6.8 per

cent. The IMF projects global economic growth to

slow down to 3.6 per cent in 2022, largely reflecting

the spillover effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine

and associated sanctions imposed on Russia, on

the global economy. In addition to the war, the IMF

predicts that disruptions to global supply chains due

to frequent and large-scale lockdowns in China,

persistent inflationary pressures leading to tightening

of monetary policies of many countries and withdrawal

of fiscal policy support previously provided across the

world to cushion the impact of the pandemic could

also affect the global growth prospects adversely.

Accordingly, economic growth rates of 3.3 per cent

and 3.8 per cent are projected in 2022 for advanced

economies and emerging market and developing

economies, respectively. Further, the global growth

projection for 2023 has been revised downwards by

the IMF to 3.6 per cent, 0.2 percentage points lower

than the January 2022 WEO.

There is consensus that in addition to the

loss of lives and human suffering, the ongoing

Russia-Ukraine conflict poses significant

economic risks beyond these two countries

creating an economic toll felt worldwide. The

war is resulting in a tragic loss of lives and human

suffering and significant damages to the Ukrainian

infrastructure and consequently, the Ukrainian

economy is set to experience a deep recession in

2022. According to the IMF, the Ukrainian economy

is expected to contract by 35 per cent in 2022. The

tight trade and financial sanctions being imposed

on Russia, including oil and gas embargoes by

some large economies, freezing of assets of the

Central Bank of Russia by Western countries and

suspension from using services of the Bank for

International Settlements are expected to result

in a sharp contraction of the Russian economy in

2022 with its GDP falling by about 8.5 per cent,

while having a substantial impact on the global

economy and financial markets. The neighbouring

countries of these two nations are particularly

affected by interruptions to trade and remittances

and by the influx of refugees. According to the

IMF, the spillover effects of the war are being

transmitted to the rest of the world through five key

channels. The first and the most impactful channel

is the surge in commodity prices including energy

and other commodities such as wheat, corn,

metals and inputs for fertilisers. This has added on

to the already high inflationary pressures caused

by supply chain disruptions and the revival from

the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, inflation

is projected to remain elevated at 5.7 per cent in

advanced economies and 8.7 per cent in emerging

market and developing economies for 2022.

Secondly, countries with direct and substantial

trade and remittances linkages with Russia

and Ukraine would also be negatively affected.

Moreover, the tourist earnings of the countries

which heavily rely on Russian and Ukrainian

tourists would be affected by lower tourist arrivals

due to economic disruptions and the withdrawal

of international payment services from Russia.

Thirdly, as the integration of Russia and Ukraine

into global value chains extends beyond typical

commodity linkages, disruptions to component

manufacturing processes stemming from raw

material shortages could propagate across the

globe through cross border production networks.

The fourth channel is business confidence and

financial conditions which have already been

tightening with the commodity price pressures and

sanctions. In the Asian region, higher global food

and energy prices, tighter global financial conditions

and reduced tourism earnings would hold back

growth for some oil importing economies while oil

exporters would gain from higher fossil fuel prices.

Agriculture industries in some South and Southeast

Asian nations that rely on Russia and Ukraine for

fertiliser and grain, on the other hand, would also

be negatively affected. Capital outflows may be

triggered from the Asian region with risk aversion

in financial markets. Developments in the Chinese

economy are expected to dominate the outlook

for Asia, with a projected economic growth of 4.4

per cent in 2022. Overall, the rising global energy

and commodity prices, leading to high domestic

inflation and widening trade deficits, weakening

global demand, volatile capital flows, exchange rate

instabilities, rising borrowing costs, and tightening

global financial conditions as a result of monetary

tightening in advanced economies, could make

developing countries more vulnerable, resulting

in recession, insolvency, and halting development

processes in some cases.

Prices of energy and food commodities were

on a rising trend throughout 2021 on the back

of global demand recovery with the easing

of COVID-19 concerns and are expected to

continue to remain elevated with the ongoing

geopolitical tensions in Europe. Although

crude oil prices fell sharply with the outbreak of

COVID-19 in 2020, prices were steadily rising from

April 2020 onwards and reached pre-pandemic

levels by March 2021 before reaching seven-year

highs in October 2021. The recent emergence of

geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine

led crude oil prices to remain above US dollars

100 per barrel due to concerns of further tightening

of global crude oil supplies as buyers remained

19

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

apprehensive of purchasing from Russia. As per

the April 2022 WEO, the average crude oil price

for 2022 is forecast at US dollars 106.83 per barrel,

thereby signalling the strong likelihood that crude

oil prices will remain elevated throughout the year

despite some downward pressures stemming

from outbreaks of COVID-19 and related mobility

restrictions, as those that are being seen in China

and the expectation of release of additional

supplies of oil from countries’ strategic reserves.

In relation to food prices, during 2021, the Food

and Agriculture Organisation’s (FAO) Food Price

Index depicted an overall growth of 28.1 per cent

above the prices observed in 2020. Global food

prices were on an upward trend amid high cost

of inputs, unfavourable climate conditions and

hesitation to increase production amid COVID-19

related uncertainties. These concerns continued

to linger and will continue to be aggravated by the

geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine,

both of whom are key agricultural exporters. This

led to the index continuing to escalate during the

first three months of 2022.

Most central banks around the world adopted

substantial monetary easing measures during

2020 and in early 2021 leading to policy interest

rates of many economies reaching historically

low levels. Contributed by multiple policy support,

including that of monetary policy, and successful

vaccination programmes, the world economy

started showing signs of recovery during 2021. In

particular, demand conditions in many countries

started to normalise faster than supply conditions,

thereby creating price pressures across multiple

sectors. As a result, several countries, especially

developed economies, began to unwind the large

monetary policy easing measures undertaken

thus far and to tighten monetary conditions in view

of rising inflationary pressures and unfavourable

inflation expectations. Further, the recent global

political uncertainty and supply disruptions, driven

by the Russia-Ukraine war, have also created added

pressures on price levels in most economies, forcing

many governments to undertake policy measures to

address inflation rates that are substantially higher

than the levels projected and experienced in the

recent past. The Federal Reserve of the United

States, which had kept the federal funds target rate

range at 0.00 per cent to 0.25 per cent for the last

two years, increased it by 25 basis points in March

2022, in view of rising inflationary pressures, as US

inflation had increased to a 40-year high in early

2022. In addition to this policy rate increase, the

Federal Reserve also signalled further tightening of

monetary policy with policy rate hikes and shrinking

of its balance sheet over the near term. The Bank

of England (BoE), which adopted an accommodative

policy stance from early 2020 onwards to support the

pandemic hit economy, commenced tightening the

monetary policy stance from late 2021. By end March

2022, BoE had raised its Bank Rate by 65 basis points

in three steps compared to the rate that prevailed

during the pandemic. Since the refinance rate of the

European Central Bank (ECB) had already reached

the zero level, policy accommodation during the

pandemic in the euro area was primarily conducted

with asset purchase programmes. However, net

asset purchases are expected to be gradually

reduced, while any adjustments to policy rates are

expected to take place sometime after the end of

net asset purchases. The ECB has also affirmed

the provisioning of forward guidance on the interest

rate path. Meanwhile, several Asian economies,

including China, continued to adopt accommodative

policies to further support economic growth. The

People’s Bank of China (PBoC) continued to relax

monetary policy in early 2022 as well, amidst modest

levels of inflation and growth concerns due to

issues in the property sector and resurgence of the

COVID-19 pandemic in some areas. The Reserve

Bank of India (RBI) continued to maintain the relaxed

20

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

1

monetary policy stance while focusing on withdrawal

of monetary stimuli to ensure that inflation remains

within the target in the period ahead. Bank Negara

Malaysia (BNM), which brought down its overnight

policy rate to 1.75 per cent in several steps in mid-

2020, continued the relaxed monetary policy stance

by maintaining the policy rate unchanged from 2021

into early 2022. Since demand driven inflationary

pressures remained subdued and medium-term

inflation projections were expected to return to target

levels with the stabilisation of energy and food prices,

Bank of Thailand (BoT) continued to maintain the

emphasis on supporting the recovery of the economy

by maintaining its dovish policy stance. Similarly,

Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) also continued

to maintain the accommodative policy stance during

2021, and had not deviated from it by March 2022

to support growth momentum, but emphasised its

readiness to address inflationary pressures that

could de-anchor inflation expectations. The policy

behaviour of Indonesia was also similar to the other

South East Asian economies discussed above,

where Bank Indonesia (BI) maintained its policy

rate stable since early 2021 onwards. At the same

time, BI continued to normalise liquidity conditions

by incrementally raising reserve requirements.

In contrast to the almost synchronous policy

accommodations by most central banks across the

world in response to the COVID-19 pandemic during

2020, the winding up of such accommodative policy

measures seem to be divergent across countries,

due to varying levels of inflationary pressures,

underlying causes of such pressures, and concerns

about growth outlook. Some economies seem to

have managed inflationary pressures better than

others, particularly with supply side adjustments,

while most countries have attempted to strike a

balance between price stability and post pandemic

growth recovery. However, by March 2022, the

developments regarding the Russia-Ukraine war

had led to substantial uncertainty over global

economic outlook. The April 2022 WEO states that

the appropriate monetary response across countries

may vary considerably as the transmission of the

effects of the war could be diverse across various

economies, and highlights the importance of clear

communication and data driven forward guidance

in order to maintain policy credibility over the period

ahead.

1.4 Macroeconomic Outlook

Sri Lanka’s economy is envisaged to grow

modestly in the near term as the economy is

to reset with a debt restructuring programme

and long overdue structural reforms alongside

an economic adjustment programme to be

supported by the IMF, which is expected to

facilitate the economy to gather momentum over

the medium term. The build-up of macroeconomic

instability in the economy, stemming from the

heightened vulnerabilities on both the external and

fiscal fronts, rising social unrest and political instability,

effects of the pandemic, the domestic energy crisis,

and elevated commodity prices both globally and

domestically are expected to significantly dampen

the growth prospects in 2022 and have lingering

effects in the immediate future leading to a slowdown

in growth. Also, economic activity is likely to further

slowdown amidst the announcement of a suspension

of external debt servicing by the Government for an

interim period and commitment to a debt restructuring

programme. However, the commissioning of prudent

macroeconomic policies aimed at stabilisation of the

domestic economy coupled with an IMF engagement,

improved monetary and fiscal policy coordination and

envisaged SOBE reforms is expected to restore the

pace of growth over the medium term. The aggressive

tightening of monetary policy is expected to contain

excessive inflationary pressures in the economy,

thereby anchoring inflation expectations, which is

21

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

pivotal in establishing a conducive environment for

investment. However, in the short run, a notable

rise in the interest rates would discourage lending,

and in turn hamper economic growth, but would

address interest rate anomalies and pressures on the

exchange rate to a certain extent, thereby attracting

productive investment in the medium to long run. The

tightened monetary policy would be instrumental in

stabilising the external value of the domestic currency

favourably, facilitating the influx of foreign exchange.

While the expansion of credit to the private sector as

well as broad money supply are expected to remain

somewhat subdued in 2023 due to the lagged effects

of tight monetary policy, growth of broad money and

private sector credit is expected to normalise and

improve from 2024 onwards over to the medium

term amidst a moderation in the expansion of NCG,

as the envisaged fiscal consolidation efforts would

materialise. Earnings from exports are expected to

moderate during 2022 before strengthening in the

period ahead with the envisaged recovery in global

demand, favourable exchange rates, and the policies

to improve the tradable sector. Demand for imports is

expected to dampen due to tight monetary policy and

difficulties in financing imports in 2022 and in the period

ahead, whilst higher global commodity prices including

fuel are likely to keep imports relatively at elevated

levels. The envisaged improvement in earnings from

exports is expected to result in a contraction of the

trade deficit in the medium term. Meanwhile, with the

gradual normalisation of the world economy as well

as the people mobility across the globe, Sri Lanka is

likely to benefit from the tourism industry in the period

ahead, once the socioeconomic unrest witnessed at

present eases away. This, together with the expected

rebound of activities in transport services and high

growth in the IT/BPO services subsector is envisaged

to strengthen the surplus in the services account over

the medium term. The primary income account deficit

is expected to moderate in the period ahead with the

expected savings on interest payments on account of

external debt due to the suspension of external debt

servicing for an interim period, and the envisaged

commencement of the debt restructuring programme.

Further, workers’ remittances are expected to improve

steadily over the medium term with the gradual

improvement in departures for foreign employment,the

improvement of global travel,increased demand for

migrant labour and expected recovery in the flow of

remittances through official channels. Consequently,

the external current account deficit is expected to

decline gradually to a sustainable level. Moreover,

financial flows are expected to strengthen over the

medium term with the envisaged non debt creating

inflows to the Colombo Port City and the development

of industrial zones, such as the Hambantota Industrial

Zone. Inflows to the financial account are expected

to be supported by the enhanced investor confidence

expected from the debt restructuring programme

and the envisaged engagement with an economic

adjustment programme supported by the IMF.

Meanwhile, the Government’s commitment towards

fiscal consolidation, along with measures to improve

revenue mobilisation with an appropriate tax structure

as well as efforts to mobilise non debt creating foreign

flows are essential to support the growth drive of the

economy. Accordingly, the Sri Lankan economy is

expected to accelerate gradually from 2023 onwards

to reach its growth potential in the medium term,

supported by prudent macroeconomic policies aimed

at economic stabilisation, thereby expanding the

productive potential of the economy while addressing

long lasting structural issues.

Projections of the Medium Term

Macroeconomic Framework require adequate

information on the impact of recently announced

policy changes (in early April 2022), including

the commencement of negotiations for an

IMF programme, forthcoming restructuring

of external debt obligations, efforts towards

strengthening fiscal consolidation, along with

the introduction of various structural reforms.

As most of these policy announcements are

currently at the initial stage, the Medium Term

Macroeconomic Framework published regularly

in the Annual Report of the Central Bank is

not available; instead, only the projections for

major macroeconomic variables for 2022 are

provided. Once informed projections for major

macroeconomic variables become available the

Medium Term Macroeconomic Framework will be

made available in forthcoming publications of the

Central Bank.

1.5 Issues and Policies

Over several decades, the Sri Lankan

economy outpaced its peers as reflected by

the economic and social changes that had

taken place, particularly in terms of reasonable

economic growth and development indicators

along with the consistent investment in

social infrastructure, although the country’s

economic prospects have been overshadowed

by persistent structural impediments that need

to be addressed with a sense of urgency to

ensure sustained macroeconomic stability and

inclusive growth. At the time of independence,

Sri Lanka was well poised for rapid economic

growth and development and appeared to be one

of Asia’s most promising nations. The country’s

unique strategic geographical location and identity

as a leading maritime and commercial hub in the

main sea route and being a classical model of

23

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

the gradual evolution towards independence,1

coupled with several other positives, including non-

aligned diplomacy, well established democracy,

continuous investment in human capital and

social infrastructure in terms of free education

resulting in high levels of literacy and free health

yielding increased life expectancy, investments

in the capital stock yielding the improvements

in physical infrastructure, as well as progressive

economic policies towards market orientation

and trade openness implemented ahead of many

other emerging economies, provided a conducive

environment for a smooth transformation of the

economy to become a prosperous nation in Asia.

In spite of such achievements, the country’s long

term economic progress has been significantly

below its potential, thereby delaying the path

towards prosperity. The Sri Lankan economy

was able to transition from a low income country

to a lower middle income status only during the

new millennium, but even such progress was not

sustained to reach higher economic status for the

benefit of the people. As such, the progress of

the economy to become a high income country

was nipped by a myriad of challenges. During the

last seven decades since the independence, the

economic performance was withered by a host of

factors such as the internal conflicts, calamitous

natural and manmade disasters, diseases,

intermittent external shocks, weak institutions,

issues in relation to accountability, transparency,

and governance, including corruption, waste,

nepotism, and certain episodes of political

instability, and above all, weaknesses in effective

economic management. As a result, the economy

is persistently saddled with volatility in growth,

high inflationary episodes, fiscal imbalances,

particularly in terms of persistently large fiscal

deficits and debt burden, and the spillover effects

1 Lee Kuan Yew. 2000. From Third World To First: The Singapore Story: 1965–2000, Singapore: Singapore Press Holdings

of fiscal imbalances on the external and monetary

sector stability. The twin deficit challenge, namely

the budget deficit and the external current account

deficit, emanating from the imbalances due to

excessive spending over and above the country’s

capacity and reflecting the imbalances in the fiscal

and external sectors, remains the major structural

impediment and the key source of economic

vulnerability in Sri Lanka. The country is one of

the classic examples to prove that prolonged

fiscal expansions contribute to current account

imbalances thus yielding several macroeconomic

ailments. In this context, the commitment towards

fiscal prudence of successive governments to

address such prolonged fiscal imbalances has

been short-lived as reflected in the expanding

budget deficits, and in turn, the rising public debt

and the associated interest costs to disconcerting

levels. On the other hand, the external sector has

been plagued by meagre export performance

amidst high import expenditure, high external

debt challenge, and the misaligned exchange

rate, posing risks to macroeconomic stability.

Inconsistent fiscal policies driven by the socially

and politically populist short term motives, instead

of adopting consistent national policies with a focus

on long term economic progress, have caused a

sequence of detrimental consequences towards

achieving the country’s macroeconomic objectives

as well as the overall welfare of the citizens.

Against this backdrop, Sri Lanka has often failed

to harness the strength of its economic endowment

and reach full economic potential by drawing

lessons from the success stories of its peers,

who have surpassed Sri Lanka in terms of both

social and economic development. Moreover, the

outbreak of the pandemic and related uncertainties

have severely undermined the past achievements

of the Sri Lankan economy, while intensifying its

macroeconomic fragilities. Amidst the disruptions

of the pandemic, several longstanding unresolved

24

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

1

structural impediments, which have been left

unaddressed and postponed repeatedly, have

now resurfaced impeding the economic recovery,

despite unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimuli

offered by the monetary and fiscal authorities,

respectively. This underscores the need for having

a credible macroeconomic plan and a national

policy agenda to address persistent and severe

macroeconomic imbalances. Therefore, ambitious

and consolidated efforts with appropriate and

consistent policy directives are required to be

implemented expeditiously by way of charting a

strong macroeconomic management framework

to address long due structural issues and new

challenges surfaced by the pandemic. Such efforts

would pave the way for the country to move towards

the envisaged higher growth trajectory over the

medium term, while ensuring stable economic

conditions, which will ultimately yield improved

living standards for the people.

In the above context, several structural issues

and policies are discussed with the view to

highlighting key areas in the economy that needs

special and urgent attention.

Achieving a sustainable current account

balance by enhancing net inflows from goods

and services exports as well as by promoting

workers’ remittances is imperative to overcome

the heightened vulnerabilities stemming from

external sector imbalances. The persistent

external current account deficit remains one of the

key and largely unaddressed vulnerabilities in Sri

Lanka’s macroeconomic landscape. This is mainly

driven by continuously widening deficits in the trade

and primary income accounts that are too large to be

offset by the surpluses in the services and secondary

income accounts. Sri Lanka’s exports in the last

few decades have seen no major growth drive or

boom due to longstanding issues such as limited

diversification, low value addition, slower integration

to global value chains and the lack of sophistication

required to remain competitive, amidst inadequate

investments in the tradable sector. In the meantime,

expenditure on imports, including non essential

and non urgent imports, have increased at a faster

pace leading to substantial trade deficits. Sri Lanka

was ahead of its regional peers in liberalising the

economy in 1977 and the adoption of liberal economic

policies, such as private sector driven development,

export led growth, and promoting FDI, that led to the

immediate realisation of notable improvements in

foreign trade. However, during the last few decades,

Sri Lanka’s international trade performance has been

lacklustre and regressing continuously, ultimately

contributing to the widening of the external current

account deficit, which has been mainly financed

through external sector borrowings, amidst limited

FDI. These borrowings to bridge the external current

account deficit and to finance the budget deficit not

only increased the external debt stock of the state,

but also increased the quantum of interest payments,

thereby contributing to the widening of the deficit in

the primary income account. In order to reduce the

debt repayment burden, it is important to ensure that

foreign borrowings are utilised effectively for income

generating and productivity enhancing ventures,

especially in the tradable sector that generates

foreign exchange earnings. At the same time, any

effort in addressing the external current account

deficit should be focused on strategies to reduce

the trade deficit by increasing the earnings from

merchandise exports, while increasing the surplus in

the services account. Further, product diversification,

vertical and horizontal integration, participation

in production sharing networks and linking with

the global value chains through component

manufacturing as well as reducing the over reliance

on certain markets as export destinations by way of

exploring new markets could be considered as vital

initiatives to maximise the return from integrating

with the rest of the world, while minimising the risk

of adverse global spillovers. Despite the changes

25

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

in the political regimes, speedy and uninterrupted

implementation of the actions outlined in the National

Export Strategy is essential in the national interest

to achieve the intended outcomes. Policy measures

aiming at promoting domestic industries that supply

intermediate goods required for key exports should

be implemented promptly to enhance the domestic

value addition in the export sector. Further, initiatives

on moving towards renewable energy sources

would also reduce the country’s reliance on fossil

fuels thereby helping to minimise the pressure on

the current account stemming from fuel imports.

Moreover, services exports are vital in cushioning

the deficit in the external current account, and

hence it is imperative to exploit their full potential.

Certain services exports, especially in the IT/BPO

sector, have the potential to become the forerunner

in bringing foreign exchange inflows to the country.

Capitalising on the high potential, the aim should

be to transform the IT/BPO sector from the current

levels of around US dollars 1 billion per year to a US

dollars 5 billion export industry in the medium term

with the necessary assistance of the Government.

Growth opportunities in the IT/BPO sectors have

expanded with the increased digitalisation of

economies worldwide which is also supported by

the novel working arrangements introduced with the

outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, Sri

Lanka should capitalise on the availability of a skilled

labour force and the state-of-the-art IT infrastructure

to promote Sri Lanka as a digital nation thereby

encouraging higher foreign exchange inflows.

Also, the IT education policy needs to be aligned

to complement the development of human capital

required to keep up with the expansion in this sector.

Moreover, the tourism sector is showing signs of

revival after the pandemic with the gradual relaxation

of travel restrictions and the success of the vaccine

drive although some new risks have emerged due

to global geopolitical tensions. Hence, to reap the

maximum benefits of the recovery in the tourism

industry, it is imperative to diversify the tourism

sector to focus on niche offerings that would attract

high spending tourists, thereby enabling access

to non traditional markets and tourists that travel

for different purposes. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka has

been heavily relying on workers’ remittances from

Middle Eastern economies to cushion the impact

of the trade deficit on the external current account.

This also increases Sri Lanka’s exposure to any

geopolitical conflicts and the growth slowdowns in

the Middle Eastern region due to oil price volatilities.

Therefore, workers’ remittances from the Middle East

can no longer be considered a sustainable source

to finance the current account deficit. Thus, there is

a need to find alternative destinations by exploring

new labour markets, especially in advanced

economies such as South Korea, Singapore, Japan

and European countries. In addition, enhancing the

skills of migrant employees is beneficial to secure

employment opportunities with higher and stable

earnings. More importantly, rerouting remittances

that are partly channelled through informal means

at present to the formal banking channel through

targeted policy measures along with the support of

all stakeholders is the need of the hour to bridge the

trade gap. In addition to the targeted measures to

address broader current account deficits, it is also

necessary to supplement them by attracting more

non debt creating inflows in the form of FDI and also

portfolio investments into the financial account of

the BOP in order to ensure greater external sector

stability and improved macroeconomic stability.

Attracting non debt creating foreign financial

inflows to strengthen the external sector

resilience has become a pressing need going

forward in order to ensure stability in the external

sector, amidst higher foreign currency debt

servicing requirements and lack of fiscal space

for debt repayment. Being a twin deficit country, Sri

Lanka has been resorting to foreign and domestic

debt to finance deficits in both the external current

account and the government budget. As a result, a

26

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

1

disproportionate increase in external debt in relation

to GDP and surging debt service payments have

been largely contributing towards the external sector

imbalances over the recent past. Moreover, with

limited access to concessional funding in line with the

transition towards a middle income country, financing

requirements have to be fulfilled through commercial

loans and sovereign debt issuances. Such efforts

are constrained by heightened uncertainties in the

global financial markets and successive sovereign

rating downgrades. Accordingly, Sri Lanka could

not raise an adequate quantum of funds in the

international capital markets during the last two

years. Amidst weak FDI inflows, foreign investments

in the stock market and the government securities

market have been considerably low over the past

two years due to weak investor sentiment owing

to the pandemic although there have been some

temporary pickups in the markets. Therefore, in the

absence of significant foreign financial inflows, the

liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market

dried up notably and foreign debt service payments

have been met at the cost of depleting foreign

reserves. Against this backdrop, it is vital to focus

on attracting non debt creating foreign financial

flows such as FDI, which are long term capital flows

and are not susceptible to immediate withdrawals

like portfolio investments rather than just resorting

to more and repeated foreign borrowings. Beyond

supporting the financing of the current account

deficit and augmenting domestic investment, FDI

fosters economic growth by generating technology

spillovers, supporting human capital development,

assisting business expansion and enhancing

international trade linkages through improved access

to foreign markets. Although FDI flows plunged

globally in 2020 and 2021 owing to the pandemic,

Sri Lanka’s FDI remained acutely low compared

to its regional peers over the past decades due to

several legal, structural and institutional deficiencies

such as rigid labour market regulations, difficulties

in obtaining utilities, complex and inconsistent tax

structures and laborious regulatory structures,

particularly related to contract enforcement, export

import documentation, business startups, obtaining

funds and property acquisition, and the lack of

well developed infrastructure facilities. Apart from

these factors, policy uncertainty, institutional and

governance weaknesses such as corruption and

coordination failures continue to pose impediments

to creating a conducive investment climate in

Sri Lanka. Therefore, in order to foster investor

confidence, Sri Lanka needs to establish a

transparent and effective policy environment by

articulating a comprehensive investment policy

and build the required human competencies and

institutional capacities to implement policy actions.

Harmonisation of investment policy with other

government development policies and strategies,

such as trade and industrial policies, as well as

inter agency coordination in implementing these

policies remain equally important. While efforts

have already been taken to rectify these concerns

by relevant authorities, it is imperative to expedite

the implementation process before global FDI flows

resume to pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore,

creating a conducive regulatory environment

through labour and land market reforms as well as

tax reforms that would simplify the tax regulations

will also complement this endeavour. Establishing

and respecting rule of law, strengthening efforts to

eradicate corruption, and ensuring transparency,

are also crucial to making Sri Lanka an attractive

investment destination. A renewed focus on

expediting policy reforms aimed at reducing

administrative deficiencies and bureaucratic

constraints will also be instrumental in attracting

and retaining a high level of FDI. Developing the

Colombo Port City and promoting the Colombo

and Hambantota ports as commodity trading hubs

could attract considerable foreign investments to the

country in the period ahead. While taking measures

to enhance FDI flows, it is essential to gradually

reduce the ISB exposure with a view to reducing

27

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

the external debt burden. Further, monetisation

of underutilised non strategic assets would also

help bring in much needed foreign exchange to

the country. Most importantly, immediate attention

should be drawn to restoring investor confidence

weakened by unwarranted fears triggered by credit

rating actions and numerous media coverage

including social media creating negative perceptions

about the country. In this regard, engaging in a

continued dialogue with existing and potential

investors, capitalising on trade and diplomatic

relations to entice investment opportunities, liaising

with regional counterparts to tap niche markets

and exploring investment opportunities to make

use of green financing options would be beneficial.

A key issue identified by many of the Green and

Sustainable Finance initiatives is the need to

develop standard definitions, i.e., a taxonomy. The

Central Bank is in the process of developing a green

finance taxonomy that will provide the framework

for investment analysis for the banking sector when

funding green projects.

There is a pressing need for all stakeholders

of the energy sector to work together to devise

a holistic plan for the energy sector that will

guarantee energy security of the economy,

while also ensuring that energy related SOBEs

serve as growth drivers of the economy that

create positive externalities. The energy sector

of Sri Lanka saw a rapid transformation in the post-

conflict era with electrification levels reaching 99

per cent and a significant progress in augmenting

the power generation infrastructure base of the

country. The Government’s recent thrust to expand

the renewable energy sector to cater to 70 per cent

of the country’s energy requirement by 2030 is a

welcome initiative as it would help substantially

improve the resilience of the energy sector,

especially in the wake of weather related volatilities

that affect hydro power generation and rising energy

commodity prices that could hinder thermal power

generation. Over the last many months, economic

activity has been significantly hampered by long

and continuous power cuts, also leading to extreme

social unrest and even political turmoil. Such

adverse developments in the form of an energy

crisis would be a significant setback to the recovery

process of the economy and its sustainability.

While several small and medium enterprises are

extremely vulnerable to such long episodes of

power cuts, several exporters, including those in

the apparel and services sector, are also likely to

lose their competitiveness, potentially resulting

in orders migrating to other competitor countries.

Even with the sharp decline in crude oil prices in

2020 followed by favourable weather conditions

throughout 2021 that enabled higher hydropower

generation, the country was not able to derive the

benefits of such price declines. At the same time, the

ongoing energy sector crisis is partly a culmination

of the persistently weak financial positions of the

key SOBEs. Their poor financial situation is further

aggravated by the upward price trends of energy

commodities and the overall scarcity of foreign

currency liquidity amidst a steady increase in

demand for energy. These developments reiterate

the importance of cost-reflective pricing for both

petroleum products and electricity tariffs, in addition

to forward looking planning and management

of such SOBEs, to create a long term energy

plan focused on assessing the growing demand

for energy and identifying sustainable means of

fulfilling such demand. The implementation of

cost reflective pricing mechanisms is essential

not only to strengthen and ensure the financial

viability of SOBEs, but also to ensure the stability

of the banking sector and the macroeconomy.

Implementation of such a mechanism can improve

efficiency, transparency and predictability, thereby

enhancing the general public’s acceptance of both

upward and downward price revisions. Hence,

such a market based mechanism can ensure that

the interests of both SOBEs and consumers are

1Introduction

In an open economy, stability in the external sector is vital as external imbalances could cause widespread spillover effects across all sectors of the economy, thereby threatening the overall macroeconomic stability. The external sector in Sri Lanka has been facing unprecedented challenges in recent years, amidst headwinds caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and adverse developments in the global economy. In this context, long term stability in the external sector, characterised by a sustainable external debt position and a manageable external current account deficit, has been identified as an important near to medium term priority in macroeconomic policymaking. Sri Lanka needs sustainable solutions to ensure long term stability in the external sector vis-a-vis short term measures.

Evolution of External Sector Related Economic Policies in Sri Lanka

At the time of gaining independence from the British, Sri Lanka was an agriculture based open economy characterised by a plantation sector and a subsistence agriculture sector with a fixed exchange rate regime. Exports were based on three main plantation crops; tea, rubber and coconut, which accounted for around 90 per cent of total exports.

External Sector Policies in the Post-Independence Era

Free Trade Policy in Early 1950s

Sri Lanka maintained a free trade policy regime in the early period of independence and the country was one of the most liberalised economies in Asia. Until the late 1950s, Sri Lanka was able to sustain the open trade policy regime with large trade surpluses supported by two commodity booms, which had led to significant build-up of foreign reserves. However, substantial trade deficits were recorded since 1957 owing to the rapid growth of import expenditure and deterioration of terms of trade.

Import Controls from Mid 1950s to Mid 1960s

Large trade deficits exerted pressure on the balance of payments (BOP) resulting in a sharp depletion of gross official reserves after 1956. In response, by establishing a Foreign Exchange Budget Committee, the Government imposed rigorous import control measures including imposition of quotas, licenses and tariffs on imports except food, petroleum and pharmaceutical imports. The development strategy of the Government was based on encouraging import substitution and domestic agricultural expansion to reduce import expenditure and achieve self sufficiency in essential commodities. By the mid 1960s, the economy was heavily regulated with protectionist measures and an overvalued fixed exchange rate was maintained. Meanwhile, export promotion strategies were also adopted to arrest the BOP issues.

BOX 2Achieving Sri Lanka’s External Sector Stability in the Medium to Long Term

Partial Liberalisation of the Economy from Late 1960s to 1970

Partial liberalisation of international trade was allowed since 1966 with partial relaxation of import restrictions accompanied by a devaluation of the currency by 20 per cent in 1967 and the introduction of the dual exchange rate system under the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate mechanism in 1968. Although foreign financing assistance was received from multilateral institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during the period, the external sector performance weakened considerably in 1960s.

Reimposition of Import Controls from 1970 to 1977

Sri Lanka experienced the most stringent trade and exchange restrictions during this period with the socialist oriented policies introduced by the new Government that came to power in 1970. All imports were brought under licensing requirements and incentives were provided to promote non-traditional exports. During this period, the economy faced global headwinds from an oil crisis, the Vietnam War and structural deficiencies in the US economy, which led the Bretton Woods System of exchange rates to collapse. With changing the value of rupee against the US dollar subsequent to the collapse of the Bretton Woods System and BOP pressures, exchange restrictions on both current and capital transactions were tightened and these rigid controls were in place until 1977.

Introduction of Open Economic Policies in 1977

The Sri Lankan economy marked a significant milestone in 1977 with the introduction of liberal economic policies with enhanced private sector participation in production and investment. As an integral part of the liberal policy regime, the dual exchange rate system was abolished by establishing a unified exchange rate. The transition from a fixed exchange rate regime to a managed float exchange rate regime, which determined the exchange rate based on market demand and supply conditions, was a radical shift in Sri Lanka’s exchange rate policy. A plethora of exchange control relaxation measures were also implemented. These policy measures included removal of restrictions on current transactions, lifting of quantitative import restrictions, rationalisation and simplification of import tariff structure, and removal of price controls and licensing requirements. Simultaneously, in view of reducing the adverse implications stemming from fiscal sector imbalances, many fiscal reforms, such as restructuring of food subsidies, privatising government enterprises and promoting private sector led growth, were introduced. Incentives were provided to encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) to export industries and export processing zones. Foreign financial flows gradually started to increase after 1977, with the relaxation of exchange restrictions. Subsequently, with the economy

changing its course from being primarily an agricultural economy to one driven by the services and industrial sectors, Sri Lanka entered into a number of preferential trade agreements to strengthen trade and investment linkages with its regional peers.

External Sector: Current Position and Issues

Persistently High Current Account Deficits

Sri Lanka has been experiencing persistent external current account deficits mainly driven by large deficits in the merchandise trade account and primary income account over the past few years. Although the trade in services account and secondary income account, which comprise workers’ remittances, recorded surpluses, these surpluses were not large enough to cushion the impact of merchandise trade and primary income account deficits on the current account. Lackluster performance in export earnings and increasing import expenditure led to a widening deficit in merchandise trade over the years. Although Sri Lanka was one of the first countries in the region to adopt liberal economic policies in 1977, its trade openness remains low. Trade openness, which is the total value of exports and imports in relation to the country’s GDP, was 36.4 per cent in 1977 and it nearly doubled to 72.2 per cent by 1979. However, Sri Lanka’s international trade performance has not been impressive in terms of trade openness, declining to levels that were seen during the pre-liberalisation era by 2019, where Sri Lanka's trade openness was 38.0 per cent. Workers’ remittances have also shown a declining trend since mid 2021, contributing to widening current account deficits.

Adverse Implications of the Easter Sunday Attacks and the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Current Account

Although the current account deficit narrowed significantly in 2019 and 2020 due to the notable contraction in the trade deficit driven by reduced import expenditure, the surplus in the services account was affected severely in both years by the loss of earnings from tourism due to the Easter Sunday attacks and travel restrictions imposed with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite a notable recovery since end 2020, the tourism sector has not yet reached pre pandemic levels thus far. Workers’

remittances, which declined initially during the pandemic period, started to increase rapidly since mid 2020. However, workers’ remittances received through formal channels started to decline since mid 2021, mainly due to the differences in the exchange rate prevailing between the grey market and official channels. The trade deficit that contracted during the last two years widened significantly in 2021, particularly during the second half of the year owing to a sharp increase in import expenditure, even amidst continuing import restrictions on selected imports, negating the impact of notable increase in export earnings. These adverse developments in the post pandemic period, particularly related to trade deficit, inflows to the services account and workers’ remittances, have aggravated the vulnerabilities in the already fragile external sector.

Meagre Performance in the Financial Account

Sri Lanka has not been able to attract non debt creating foreign financial flows, such as FDI up to the expected levels, even during the post war period, due to structural and policy issues related to FDI. Over the past decade, annual FDI inflows remained around US dollars 1.3 billion, on average, and around 1-2 per cent of GDP. The prevailing weak investment climate in Sri Lanka can be attributed to a range of factors including policy uncertainty, restrictive labour regulations, lack of progress in ease of doing business, inconsistencies in protection of property rights, weaknesses in maintenance of law and order, and so forth. In addition, institutional weaknesses, such as corruption, weak regulations, red tape and faltering infrastructure have resulted in Sri Lanka attracting significantly lower inflows of FDI than its peer economies.

Mounting External Debt

During the last decade, the mounting external debt and growing debt service payments were the major contributors to the external sector imbalances. With Sri Lanka accessing international financial markets to raise funds by issuing International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) since 2007, the country's external debt has been accumulating at a steady pace. However, this increased the overall cost of funding of the debt portfolio as

ISBs were often priced at relatively high interest rates compared to the development assistance finances Sri Lanka used to receive at concessional rates. Moreover, the expansion in government fiscal deficit due to the financing of large infrastructure projects with the post war economic resurgence also contributed towards this increase. Following the trend in debt accumulation, the external debt as a percentage of GDP has also gradually been on the rise over the past decade and remains around 60 per cent of GDP, on average. When comparing the external debt as a percentage of GDP with its regional peers, Sri Lanka has recorded the highest ratio after Bhutan, Maldives and Cambodia. Except for these four countries, the external debt to GDP ratio of other peer Asian countries lies well below 50 per cent of their respective GDP.

Foreign Debt Service Payments

Increasing external debt stock as well as the compositional change in Sri Lanka’s foreign debt profile from concessional borrowings to costlier non-concessional and commercial borrowings have resulted in increased foreign debt service payments. The high cost of external borrowings has expanded the deficit in the primary income account, exerting further pressure on the current account of the BOP. Total external debt service payments as a percentage of export of goods and services has increased from 13.2 per cent in 2011 to 30.0 per cent in 2021 indicating that nearly one third of Sri Lanka’s annual export earnings are consumed for debt servicing. Further, government debt servicing accounts for more than 80 per cent of the foreign debt service payments indicating that the external sector financing issues are mainly stemming from fiscal imbalances.

Declining Gross Official Reserves

The gross official reserve position of the country deteriorated to critically low levels by end 2021 due to higher foreign currency debt service payments amidst inadequate foreign exchange inflows. The low level of foreign exchange inflows in terms of export earnings repatriation, workers’ remittances and foreign capital

flows resulted in a shortage of liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market necessitating the Central Bank to supply foreign exchange to finance essential imports, which further depleted the reserve levels.

Significant Pressure on the Exchange Rate

The external sector imbalances are largely reflected by the dried up liquidity conditions in the domestic foreign exchange market, series of sovereign rating downgrades along with the precarious level of international reserves that have exerted significant depreciation pressures on the exchange rate. While the exchange rate was maintained at around Rs. 200 – 203 per US dollar during most of 2021 and until early March 2022, mainly through moral suasion by the Central Bank, a notable development of parallel markets for foreign exchange was observed. However, following the adjustment in the exchange rate in early March 2022 and subsequent market pressure, the Sri Lanka rupee depreciated sharply by 33.0 per cent against the US dollar by end March 2022. However, some stability in the exchange rate is expected with the significant tightening of the monetary policy stance in early April 2022 along with other corrective measures currently being considered to be implemented with immediate effect, which mainly include, initiating discussions with the IMF for an economic adjustment programme, suspension of external debt servicing for an interim period leading to an orderly and consensual debt restructuring process, and fiscal consolidation, along with the negotiations to obtain bridging financing.

Medium to Long Term Policies to Achieve External Sector Stability

The Central Bank took a number of short term measures in the recent past to address the external sector issues. The Central Bank issued new rules pertaining to mandatory repatriation and conversion of proceeds of exports of goods and services to Sri Lanka rupees that helped improve the liquidity conditions in the domestic foreign exchange market. Further, with the aim of building up of gross official reserves through non borrowed sources, the Central Bank instructed the licensed banks to sell to the Central Bank a portion of

foreign exchange so converted. Although this measure impacted the liquidity in the domestic forex market to a certain extent, it enabled the Central Bank to supply much needed foreign exchange to the market to partly finance the demand for essential goods imports. Initiatives were taken to encourage transferring of workers’ remittances through formal channels including the provision of incentives above the normal exchange rate for the foreign exchange remittances converted at licensed banks, reimbursement of transaction costs incurred on account of workers’ remittances, and the launch of a National Remittance Mobile Application branded as “Lanka Remit”. Further, rules were issued requiring hotel service providers registered with the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority to accept payments in respect of services rendered to non residents only in foreign exchange. Moreover, the Central Bank has also been able to secure foreign financial assistance from regional central banks by way of bilateral currency swaps. Although the short term policy measures have been effective in reviving the external sector to a certain extent, policies spanning over medium to long term are required to enhance the resilience and maintain continuous stability in the external sector. Such policies should be focused on the following key areas:

Medium Term Measures

Initiating Comprehensive Macroeconomic Reforms Consistent with an Economic Adjustment Programme Supported by the IMF

Considering the spiraling economic issues faced by the country, the Government has decided to begin negotiations with the IMF that may lead to a possible IMF funded programme aiming at macroeconomic stability. This IMF funding arrangement could be complemented with a comprehensive reform agenda in major areas, such as fiscal consolidation, strengthening financial performance of State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs), phasing out monetary financing, and improving efficiency in social safety net programmes, among others.

The Need for Ensuring External Debt Sustainability

The current focus of the Government and the Central Bank is on ensuring the sustainability of the country’s external debt in the long term to build resilience in the economy. In this context, the Government has already published Request for Proposals from interested parties for appointing Financial Advisors and Legal Consultants for managing its external debt in a sustainable manner. Such debt management process may involve a comprehensive debt restructuring plan, which would be conditional upon an agreement to an economic reform programme with the IMF. In parallel, the Government announced on 12 April 2022 that it would temporarily suspend external debt servicing for an interim period pending consensual external debt restructuring. These measures are expected to reduce high exposure to external debt and thus helping to ensure external debt sustainability.

Maintaining Healthy Levels of Gross Official Reserves

In order to maintain external sector stability, it is crucial to maintain a healthy level of gross official reserves, which is an indicator of the country’s ability to withstand external shocks as well as its ability to honour external debt service payments. Hence, increasing the country’s gross official reserves remain the most important medium term objective of the external sector. The country envisages to enhance gross official reserves to cover a minimum of 4 months of merchandise imports. While these targets remain significantly challenging, the ongoing efforts towards debt restructuring and envisaged foreign currency inflows are expected to increase gradually over the medium to long term, enabling the gradual build-up of gross official reserves. While the medium term objective of the Central Bank is to gradually increase the quantity of reserves, the composition is also expected to be improved by organic build-up of reserves through non-borrowed sources.

Strengthening Regional Cooperation

It is essential to maintain international cooperation with regional stakeholders, including regional central banks, governments, business communities, investors and multilateral agencies to build up stakeholder confidence leading to sustained external sector stability over the medium term. In this regard, the Central Bank continues to hold discussions on future collaborations with counterparts in several regional countries.

Long Term Measures to Strengthen Non-debt Creating Foreign Exchange Inflows

Promoting Merchandise and Services Exports Sectors

The National Export Strategy (NES) is instrumental in supporting both goods and services export industries to achieve higher foreign exchange earnings. The existing NES was designed and implemented with a view to transforming Sri Lanka into an export hub driven by innovation and was expected to be implemented within a 5-year horizon from 2018 - 2022. It will be important to revive the NES with some modifications to suit the more recent developments in international trade and provide much needed policy support to the exports sector and such policies should continue without interruption under any political regime. Implementation of a broad based and consistent NES is expected to create steady and sustainable growth in exports while unlocking potential export sectors to create new job opportunities and facilitating value addition through increased participation in global value chains and product sharing networks. Along with these, measures should be introduced and monitored in attracting investment to the tradable sector, especially for industries producing intermediate goods for the export sector and industries oriented mainly towards global trade.

Equal attention should be given to promoting services sector exports that have high potential and domestic value addition than traditional merchandise exports. Earnings from tourism have been the major contributor to the surplus in the services account in the recent years although being severely affected by the Easter Sunday attacks and the COVID-19 pandemic. Continuous promotion of tourism to reach its potential should be

and establishing modern investment zones for local and foreign private investors, are expected to attract considerable foreign investment to the country in the period ahead. A close coordination and monitoring mechanism to facilitate and promote such investment is necessary to build long term macroeconomic resilience.

Conclusion

The corrective measures taken by the Government and the Central Bank, including initiating negotiations with the IMF for an economic adjustment programme, commencement of an external debt restructuring process, commitment towards fiscal consolidation, alongside significant monetary policy tightening and more market based exchange rate determination, are expected to help restore confidence of stakeholders in the economy in the period ahead. It is imperative that the long neglected structural reforms are introduced in the immediate future to reduce the external current account deficit and the fiscal deficit, which remained the root cause of the recurring external sector instability for decades. Managing the twin deficits at sustainable levels is crucial to ensure long term sustainability in country’s external debt, while maintaining healthy levels of reserves to withstand economic headwinds, thereby ensuring long term stability of the external sector.

prioritised. Other services sectors, such as IT/ BPO, transportation and port services sectors, also have to be integrated into the national plan to strengthen export earnings from goods and services.

Enhancing Workers’ Remittances

With the gradual dissipation of the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of targeted policy measures, workers’ remittances have shown signs of improvement. The departures for foreign employment are rising as reflected by the increase in migrant workers registering with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE). Further, narrowing of the gap between the official exchange rate and the grey market rate is also expected to help attract higher foreign remittances formally. Active stakeholder engagement to promote foreign employment, diversifying foreign employment market and upskilling of migrant employees are expected to secure more foreign employment opportunities with higher earnings, thereby increasing the contribution of workers’ remittances to cushion the impact of the widening trade deficit.

Attracting FDI

To sustain a healthy momentum of non debt creating foreign financial flows, such as FDI over the medium term, there is a dire need to maintain policy consistency, improve doing business conditions, strengthening institutions, and expediting the approval and the implementation processes to facilitate FDI.

collaborative efforts are also required not only

between the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC)

and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) but also

with other stakeholders such as the Public Utilities

Commission of Sri Lanka, Sustainable Energy

Authority, Independent Power Producers and other

private and public stakeholders to devise not only

a suitable pricing mechanism but also sustainable

long term strategies with due consideration to

all aspects of the energy sector. Going forward,

with the growing demand for energy stemming

from the development of the Colombo Port City,

industrial zones, and other infrastructure projects,

it is essential that appropriate plans are devised

to ensure the provision of reliable, adequate, and

affordable energy utilities to improve the country’s

productivity and competitiveness.

Measures need to be taken expeditiously

to accelerate the expected FDI inflows into

the Colombo Port City in order to optimise

its potential benefits to the economy. The

Colombo Port City Economic Commission, which

was established recently via a Parliamentary Act,

enables the facilitation of FDI inflows to the country

through the issuance or granting of registrations,

licenses, and authorisations to engage in business,

facilitating and exercising overall regulatory

supervision, and leasing of Government’s

channelled into the initial stages, the contribution

of the Colombo Port City to the domestic economy

as the main conduit of integration to the global

economy is vital, given the shortfall in major

growth drivers at present. Nevertheless, FDI to the

Colombo Port City remain modest as the timing of

the completion of the initial stages of the project

was not perfect due to the prevailing international

investor sentiments, driven by the concerns amidst

the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainties caused

by the geopolitical tensions along with heightened

domestic economic hardship. However, as the

Colombo Port City has the proximity advantage

to major cities in South Asia and South East Asia,

it is expected to facilitate enhancing FDI into the

country over the medium term, provided that

aggressive investor facilitation and promotions

are initiated immediately. Further, easing of the

long rooted structural bottlenecks for investments

and businesses is also vital to entice investors’

preference towards Sri Lanka, though the Colombo

Port City is governed by specific legislation

and regulatory arrangements. Also, a robust

and customised strategy to approach potential

investors to promote investments would have to

be considered. Moreover, as a Financial City is

proposed to be established within the Colombo Port

City as the financial services hub, it is important to

capture these economic activities into the country’s

GDP to fully reflect the contribution of the Colombo

Port City to the economy. The development of the

Colombo Port City as a financial centre is expected

to enhance inflows to the services account through

exports of financial services, IT/BPO services,

etc. Also, as the Colombo Port City is strategically

located in a geopolitically important position that

draws strategic interest from global investors in

a competitive environment, any foreign interest

needs to be dealt with in line with Sri Lanka's non

aligned foreign policy, with a view to strengthening

foreign relationships with regional and global

counterparts. Also, as the legislative structure

under which the Colombo Port City is governed

provides a highly conducive business environment

for foreign investors, policies would have to be

carefully formulated to ensure that it would not

disintegrate from the main economy. Given the

massive initial investment made in the Colombo

Port City and the considerable tax benefits that

were extended to newly established enterprises

during the gestation period, the success of the

whole project will depend on the amount of revenue

collected from the ventures in terms of taxes and

other means and using the same for the benefit of

the economy. The skill premium required by the

more advanced enterprises to be established in the

Colombo Port City would be reflected in the wage

premium offered by such enterprises, triggering

a migration of skilled labour to the Colombo Port

City from the rest of Sri Lanka. Two major effects

could be expected when a modern sector is carved

out within an economy. Firstly, there would be

an acceleration of structural transformation, as

the wage premium on offer could encourage the

acquisition of skills in high demand, leading to

an overall improvement in labour productivity.

Secondly, it could lead to deviations in income

distribution due to the attractive wage premiums

on offer in the modern sector. Nevertheless, the

wage premium gap would be an incentive for

workers to develop specialised skills to match the

modern technology and requirements in a dynamic

labour market. At the same time, the education

system would have to be transformed to cater to

the demand for skilled workers in the Colombo

Port City and efforts to produce more graduates

in STEM (science, technology, engineering and

maths) subjects must be reinforced. This project

is also expected to boost the tourism industry and

it would require exploring ways to attract affluent

tourists given the potential to promote the Colombo

Port City as a luxury destination. The activities and

accommodation available in the Colombo Port

City need to target a niche market of tourists and

carry a premium price. Further, a resident guest

visa programme and the newly proposed Golden

Paradise residential visa programme could be

promoted overseas targeting to attract residential

visa holders for the Colombo Port City. The income

from services and inflows of FDI to the Colombo

Port City are expected to provide much needed

non debt creating financial flows to the BOP over

the medium term and thereby bolster the policy

efforts aimed at the recovery of Sri Lanka’s external

sector.

Persistently low revenue mobilisation over

the years remains the key underlying reason

for the continued vulnerabilities in the fiscal

sector and the macroeconomic imbalances,

warranting the need for adopting sustainable

revenue generation measures. Although

government expenditure in Sri Lanka remains at

a moderate level compared to the regional peers,

government revenue collection has been well below

the average revenue collection of peer economies

and has been continuously declining over the

past two decades. In 2021, government revenue

as a percentage of GDP was only 8.7 per cent in

Sri Lanka, whereas the same for emerging and

middle income countries stood at 26 per cent of

GDP. The low tax regime introduced in late 2019

coupled with the economic downturn caused by the

COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a sharp reduction

in government revenue in the past two years.

Moreover, tax elasticity and tax buoyancy of Sri

Lanka are estimated to be less than unity indicating

that the expansion in tax revenue mobilisation is

weaker than the expansion in economic activity.2

In addition, Sri Lanka’s tax system has turned

out to be a regressive system with over 75 per

cent of tax revenue being collected by means of

indirect taxes, posing a disproportionately high tax

burden on low income households. The multitude

Tax buoyancy reflects the total response of tax revenue to chang-es in GDP, which includes the impact of discretionary policy adjustments such as increase in tax rates and expansion in the tax base.

of tax exemptions and tax holidays which have not

necessarily translated into higher economic activity,

ad hoc tax rate reductions and upward revisions in

tax free thresholds and tax brackets, slow expansion

in the tax base, lack of progressive taxes, low tax

compliance, tax evasion and tax avoidance as well

as weak tax administration are the major factors

that have led to low tax revenue mobilisation

in Sri Lanka. Frequent tax changes have also

negatively impacted tax compliance, hindering the

consistency of the tax system, while increasing the

cost of tax administration. Persistently low revenue

mobilisation has posed serious repercussions on the

macroeconomy, with elevated budget deficits and

higher financing requirements from both foreign and

domestic sources, thereby resulting in burgeoning

public debt, vulnerabilities in the domestic financial

system, inflationary pressures, BOP issues and

depreciation pressures on the exchange rate.

Low revenue mobilisation also impedes long term

economic growth by restricting the Government’s

capacity to make public investments in both physical

and social infrastructure. These deep-rooted

issues emphasise the importance of expediting

the implementation of consistent and persistent

revenue based fiscal consolidation that would

eventually render long run macroeconomic stability

and sustainable growth. In this regard, raising tax

rates for both direct and indirect taxes, broadening

the tax base by lowering tax free thresholds,

reducing tax exemptions and eliminating long tax

holidays could enhance government revenue in the

short term. Any tax concessions should be granted

by giving due consideration to the effectiveness of

such policies in improving fiscal balances in the long

term through the achievement of economic growth

and overall macroeconomic objectives. Such

concessions should be short time bound and linked

to measurable performance outcomes in the specific

industry with a view to gradually supporting the

envisaged development. Further, making realistic

revenue forecasting and revenue targets based

35

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

on past experiences and economic conditions is

extremely important to correct recurring deviations

in revenue targets and expenditure overruns

resulting in continuous expansion in the budget

deficit. In addition, maintaining a consistent and

simple tax structure is imperative to encourage tax

compliance and thereby improve revenue collection.

Meanwhile, strengthening tax administration is also

critical in enhancing government revenue, as the

sustainability of enhanced tax collection usually

coincides with reforms in tax administration. Given

the interlinked tax administration activities, a holistic

approach pursuing multiple reform strategies at

numerous tax administrative layers could improve

the capacity and efficiency of the tax administration,

while reducing tax evasion. Thus, strict enforcement

of rules related to registration and filing,

strengthening audits and verification measures

through better coordination with financial institutions,

upgrading information technology systems for

greater institutional coordination, and simplifying

the procedures for tax filing, tax payments and

reporting are vital for improving tax administration.

Moreover, attention should also be paid towards

improving the management, governance, and

human resources of tax administration agencies by

enriching the technical skills of the staff, monitoring

the performance of such agencies, implementing

prudent strategic plans, and empowering revenue

collecting entities by strengthening tax legislation.

Since large taxpayers make a higher contribution to

government tax revenue collection, scaling up of tax

administration efforts targeted at large taxpayers

is also vital to ensure timely filing and payment of

taxes. Moreover, a high level of political will and

commitment with a strong and deep social dialogue

is also key to enhancing the effectiveness of these

reforms. Efficacy and efficiency of government

spending and transparency of government finances

are also necessary to encourage tax payments, in

order to promote a culture of higher tax compliance.

Achievement of medium term fiscal targets

of the Government is highly conditional on

consistent, well-coordinated and evidence

based policymaking. Historical evidence pinpoints

to notable deviations in successive governments’

fiscal operations in comparison to budgetary

estimates and medium term fiscal rules, with revenue

mobilisation often falling short of the targets and

government expenditure exceeding the estimates in

consecutive years. Implementation of ad hoc policy

measures that are inconsistent with the overall fiscal

and macroeconomic objectives remains one of the

key reasons for such undue deviations. Most of

these unplanned policies have direct or indirect fiscal

implications on revenue and expenditure fronts, and

the means of deficit financing. Consequently, ad hoc

government policies driven by socially and politically

populist short term motives could have intertemporal

effects on the budget, creating long term spending

commitments for the Government that could be

detrimental towards achieving fiscal objectives and

the overall welfare of the citizens. For instance,

managing and rationalising recurrent expenditure is

a challenging task amidst large scale recruitments

to the public sector, without considering the cadre

requirements and not linking wage increments to

productivity improvements, as well as the provision

of allowances/ subsidies that are difficult to be

withdrawn in future without causing social unrest.

Extemporary policymaking also leads to fiscal

indiscipline, lack of transparency and accountability,

thus resulting in an uncertain business environment.

In addition, the imposition of ad hoc retrospective

taxes to meet short term revenue shortfalls of the

Government could create inconsistency in the tax

system, uncertainties for businesses, and erode

both local and foreign investor confidence, along

with the increased cost of taxation being ultimately

passed onto consumers causing hardship for the

public. Further, government policies implemented

for the betterment of one sector may have spillover

effects on the other sectors and in turn, have

36

indirect budgetary implications. Hence, evidence

based and well coordinated policymaking with a

holistic view is of paramount importance to minimise

unforeseen implications on fiscal performance and

discipline. Moreover, it is crucial to educate the

general public that short term untargeted handouts

and fiscal indiscipline often result in long term fiscal

imbalances eventually affecting macroeconomic

stability and sustainable growth while creating a

higher tax burden on future generations. Creating

such awareness is vital to transforming the mindset

of the general public to assess the performance

of the governments based on their effectiveness

in achieving long term macroeconomic objectives.

Such a transformation in the mindset of the public

would encourage the authorities to refocus their

priorities towards long run development objectives

and welfare maximising policies instead of

implementing myopic and populist policies in an ad

hoc manner.

The sharp rise in central government debt

driven by weakened fiscal sector performance

over the past several decades continues to remain

a key issue on the fiscal front, raising concerns

for investors, creditors, and rating agencies.

Persistent structural budget deficits, expenditure

overruns, continued government revenue slippages,

rising gross financing needs and excessive borrowings

by consecutive Governments have culminated in

substantially high public debt levels. Moreover,

sluggish economic growth recorded in recent years

and the unprecedented economic setback during

the pandemic have further aggravated the country’s

debt issue, while deteriorating the key fiscal ratios.

Posing many macroeconomic challenges, the debt

stock increased by two folds every five to six years

in nominal terms in the past, reaching the second

historically highest debt to GDP ratio of 104.6 per cent

by end 2021. A high level of public debt exacerbates

the economy’s vulnerability to macroeconomic

shocks. Growing public debt also restrains room

for adopting countercyclical fiscal policy measures,

creates spillover effects on the private sector through

increased risk premia and cost of borrowings, which

are linked to lower sovereign credit rating. This could

severely limit economic recovery and may result

in further economic contraction. Thus, aggressive

fiscal consolidation is needed to reduce the debt

burden and stabilise the debt at manageable levels

even amidst periods of subpar economic growth. In

addition, the high debt burden could adversely affect

the country’s long run economic growth, especially

by crowding out private investment and reducing

the capacity for public investment towards needy

sectors, such as health, education, and infrastructure,

to enhance productivity over the long term. At the

same time, higher debt servicing costs associated

with high debt levels often pose challenges to the

effectiveness of monetary policy, especially when

the fiscal deficit is excessively monetised by the

monetary authority. Further, high debt levels increase

the possibility of future distortionary taxes and

uncertainties and create financial system instabilities.

The public debt burden in Sri Lanka has amplified

the external sector vulnerabilities, especially due to

the higher share of foreign debt and unfavourable

maturity structure, with the bunching of maturing

foreign debt service obligations. This high public

debt trajectory of Sri Lanka was led by the weak

adherence to fiscal consolidation targets amidst the

formation of over-optimistic revenue targets and poor

revenue mobilisation, recurring primary deficits, lower

than expected economic growth, non-availability

of concessional inflows, and foreign borrowings

which have not been matched with productive

projects that generate foreign currency earnings.

Gradual improvement in government finances is

essential to phaseout additional borrowings to meet

interest obligations, both in terms of domestic and

foreign debt, to ease debt accumulation. Therefore,

expeditious actions are crucial to preserve debt

sustainability, particularly through committed fiscal

discipline and rigorous fiscal consolidation efforts

to generate a substantial surplus in the primary

balance. Credible commitment to adhere to fiscal

rules, i.e., the long lasting constraints imposed

on fiscal policy by imposing numerical limits on

budgetary aggregates, that are specified in the Fiscal

Management (Responsibility) Act No. 3 of 2003 is

imperative to ensure sustainable fiscal consolidation,

and thereby curbing the pressures for overspending,

and ensuring fiscal transparency and accountability.

Fiscal discipline can be further strengthened by

implementing binding fiscal rules, instead of voluntary

and non binding fiscal rules. Also, efforts to replenish

reserves and build reserves through foreign currency

receipts or outflow management need to be pursued,

irrespective of short term difficulties to be faced in

relation to real economic activity. The implementation

of overdue economic reforms with regard to SOBEs

such as the introduction of the cost reflective pricing

mechanisms and establishment of an efficient

governance structure is also essential as persistent

losses of such inefficient institutions are more likely

to be eventually converted into the state’s contingent

liabilities. In addition, the promotion of long term

economic growth is also vital to essentially reduce

the debt-to-GDP ratio, while structural reforms

are crucial to eliminating obstacles to sustainable

economic growth. Considering the limited fiscal

space, the Government should streamline the

foreign funded projects that are in the pipeline taking

economic priorities into account, while devoting much

attention to high economic rates of return ensuring

transparent and efficient use of funds, which reduces

the future accumulation of debt stock of the Central

Government. Further, seeking concessional financing

could also help the Government to meet its debt

sustainability targets and strengthen macroeconomic

fundamentals. For example, resorting to green/

blue financing options for implementing sustainable

infrastructure projects could involve more favourable

conditions for borrowing, such as relatively low

interest rates and longer repayment periods.

As the country grapples with the setbacks

caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the need

for improving public sector service delivery,

in terms of quality and efficiency, has become

more crucial than ever before in the process

of economic recovery. The public sector has

been an integral part of Sri Lanka’s development

path by delivering much needed public goods and

services, ensuring inclusive and equitable access

to infrastructure, and creating a conducive business

environment with the aim of fostering private sector

investments and growth. The role played by certain

subsectors in the public sector in combating the

spread of COVID-19 and mitigating socioeconomic

hardships has reinstated its eminence, particularly

in the recent past. Since the economy is gradually

adjusting to a ‘new normal’ amidst the pandemic

and regaining growth momentum, efficient

resource allocation in the public sector and

minimising bureaucratic red tapes related to public

administration and business facilitation are vital

to assist pandemic affected individuals as well as

the business fraternity, including local and foreign

investors. However, growing inefficiencies in the

public sector and the resultant fiscal burden remain

longstanding concerns in policy circles, since the

public sector is utilising a considerable fraction of

financial and labour resources, which otherwise

could have been available for efficient use by the

private sector. Meanwhile, the pandemic has further

exposed the existing weaknesses and rigidities

in the public sector service delivery, creating new

challenges and opportunities to improve government

services. Although ‘work from home’ arrangements

were widely adopted during the pandemic, the

performance of the public sector under these new

arrangements was not comparable with that of the

private sector that successfully institutionalised these

new norms. Limitations in the physical infrastructure

and automated systems as well as limited adaptability

of the public sector labour force, weak monitoring

mechanism and stringent working arrangements

1Fiscal Policies during the Pandemic

Fiscal policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic curbed the scarring effects on economies across the world facilitating post pandemic recovery, albeit with a notable bearing on public finances, and in turn resulting in fiscal stress in these countries. The swift fiscal measures deployed in response to the unanticipated and unprecedented economic headwinds were disparate in scale, type, and coverage and were dependent on the specific structural, inherent and fiscal leeway of each economy. Advance markets and large emerging markets were in relatively better positions with ample fiscal space to accommodate such fiscal stimuli, compared to small emerging markets and developing economies. Direct budgetary measures such as increased spending on health, provision of unemployment benefits and other reliefs, tax concessions and tax deferments, liquidity support, equity injections, and indirect actions including provision of guarantees for deferred debt repayments were among common fiscal policy measures implemented by numerous countries. The steady stream of fiscal stimuli via deficit spending, and lingering effects of the pandemic together with the slowdown in economic growth have put pressure on fiscal operations of most economies, thereby threatening macroeconomic stability in respective countries.

The outbreak of the pandemic and related uncertainties have severely affected Sri Lanka, prominently the fiscal sector, as reported in many other lower middle-income and market access countries. Despite insufficient fiscal space to undertake hefty fiscal intervention, the Sri Lankan Government also committed to providing a number of fiscal stimuli to address pressing priorities since the onset of the pandemic. With increased expenses for healthcare and pandemic control measures as well as financial and in-kind transfers to vulnerable groups, the Government spent at least Rs. 117.5 billion and Rs. 165.6 billion as pandemic related expenses for 2020 and 2021, respectively. The Government instituted a low tax regime to boost the sluggish economic activity since the latter part of 2019 and this low tax environment was upheld during the pandemic period. Several tax reliefs for certain essential imports such as medicines were also granted during this period. Consequently, government revenue dwindled sharply during the pandemic period owing to modest tax rates, and diminished tax base due to the increases in tax free thresholds as well as subpar economic growth. Accordingly, fiscal deficit in 2020 and 2021 increased to 11.1 per cent and 12.2 per cent of the GDP, respectively. Meanwhile, as per the Fiscal Monitor Database of Fiscal Policy Responses to COVID-19 Pandemic – October 2021, the cumulative value of additional spending and foregone revenue by the Sri Lankan Government in relation to the pandemic was around 1.1 per cent of the GDP, which

BOX 3Fiscal Consolidation: Path to Macro Fiscal Stability

is low in comparison to several regional peers, such as India (4.1 per cent), Pakistan (2.0 per cent), Bangladesh (2.3 per cent), and Maldives (8.0 per cent). In addition, with limited fiscal space to manoeuvre, pandemic affected individuals and businesses in Sri Lanka were mainly supported by accommodative monetary policy. Moreover, reduced foreign inflows amidst the pandemic and substantial debt service payments added further stress on the fiscal and external sectors. With limited avenues for new foreign financing sources, liquidity constraints in the international capital markets as well as sovereign rating downgrades of Sri Lanka, the Government was compelled to resort to higher domestic borrowings, especially through the Central Bank and the banking sector, to meet the government financing gaps. Such fiscal imbalances led to the government debt reaching 100.6 per cent and 104.6 per cent of GDP by end 2020 and end 2021, respectively.

Nevertheless, the current weak fiscal position and the resultant macroeconomic issues in Sri Lanka are not entirely due to the pandemic situation, but rather a reflection of longstanding and unresolved issues in the fiscal sector. For several decades, Sri Lanka has been plagued by persistent fiscal deficits, compelling the Government to continually borrow from both domestic and foreign markets and accumulate public debt. As a result, a large fraction of government revenue and foreign currency inflows to the country are required to be channelled for debt service payments, permitting little leeway for productive investments. Since 1994, revenue and grants have not been sufficient to meet at least recurrent expenditure of the Government, necessitating government borrowings to cover recurrent expenses that generally do not contribute to future growth and

the country’s debt repayment potential. Moreover, as depicted in Figure B 3.1, revenue and grants in 2020 and 2021 were well below the rigid expenses that include salaries, pension, and interest payments, amplifying the severity of the issue. The unprecedented large tax reductions announced in end 2019 aggravated the issue of low revenue mobilisation of the Government, compelling monetary financing of the budget deficit during 2020 and 2021.

The Medium Term Macro-Fiscal Framework which is unveiled along with the Budget Speech outlining the Government’s targets to reduce the overall budget deficit and debt levels to a sustainable level over the past several years has never materialised, as reflected in the historical trend of actual data. Over ambitious targets for government revenue in the Budget and planning of annual expenditure in line with the overestimated revenue have always resulted in a wider than expected budget deficit. Meanwhile, the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, No. 3 of 2003 (FMRA) was enacted to ensure responsible fiscal management, prudent debt management and public scrutiny over fiscal affairs via

implementing ‘fiscal rules’ that are, however, not binding rules. These fiscal rules pertaining to fiscal deficit, public debt and contingent liabilities of the Government as stipulated in the FMRA have been subsequently amended as given in Table B 3.1. Successive Governments constantly have not met the fiscal deficit rule, while fiscal rules in relation to public debt reduction and limiting of contingent liabilities have not been attained at specified milestones. Instead, the FMRA has been amended several times, extending the time targets along with several approvals for supplementary budgets. A strong commitment to ensure prudent fiscal management has not been evident as against the proposed path of fiscal consolidation.

The Impact of Weak Fiscal Performance on Price Stability and Financial System Stability

According to Sargent and Wallace (1981), amidst fiscal dominance, the central banks are compelled to generate seigniorage revenues to ensure the solvency of governments, when fiscal operations are fixed to a given higher fiscal deficit path. Blanchard (2004) also asserts that inflation targeting only through monetary policy may not be successful in a high debt environment. The monetary authority’s attempt to raise the real interest rate with the aim of maintaining inflation at a targeted rate may aggravate debt levels through increased borrowing costs, if the fiscal authority is disinclined for fiscal consolidation. Moreover, rising debt levels could intensify sovereign default risk and exert exchange rate depreciation pressure, and thereby result in higher inflation instead of lower inflation. Therefore, Blanchard (2004) emphasises that in a high debt environment, inflation should be managed through fiscal policy by attempting to reduce fiscal deficits, and thereby government debt levels, instead of only using monetary policy to combat inflation. Meanwhile, some academics have argued that inflation and financial repression1

1 Financial repression is used to lower the cost of borrowing for the Government by way of explicit or implicit caps on interest rates, direct lending to the Government by captive domestic sources such as pension and provident funds, regulation of cross-border capital movements, and a strong connection between the Government and banks.

sector, creating greater uncertainties, reducing investor confidence, and aggravating vulnerabilities in the financial system, thereby hindering high and sustained economic growth. Therefore, at this critical juncture, the objective of attaining macroeconomic stability by resolving the macroeconomic imbalances supersedes the objective of achieving near term higher growth. Contrary to the traditional Keynesian view, recent studies have also indicated the possibility of offsetting contractionary effects of fiscal consolidation, when the fiscal consolidation is large and perceived to be credible by the public, especially when public debt levels are high (Giavazzi & Pagano, 1990). On one hand, private consumption could increase if households perceive there is a permanent reduction in the government borrowing requirement when the Government is committed to achieving fiscal consolidation. Such a reduction in government borrowings implies lower taxes in future and thus, a higher lifetime income for the households, encouraging them to increase their consumption from the current period. On the other hand, a reduction in government borrowing requirements will reduce inflation risk premia and default risk premia associated with public debt issuances due to lower inflation expectations and fewer economic uncertainties. This will lead to a fall in real interest rates and promote more productive private investment. As such, given the serious macroeconomic imbalances emanating from weak fiscal conditions, well-planned fiscal consolidation measures are more likely to be beneficial for the Sri Lankan economy, particularly to ensure macroeconomic stability and growth in the medium to long term. However, it is crucial that Sri Lanka implements the optimal combination of consolidation strategies to minimise possible contractionary effects in the short term and thereby avert fiscal austerity being a ‘self-defeating’ strategy.

At the same time, fiscal consolidation may have disproportionate effects on different economic segments resulting in widening inequalities. Fiscal austerity could worsen the prevailing inequalities that have been aggravated by the COVID-19. Therefore, consolidation strategies should be implemented with due consideration of not only output effects but also of possible consequences of austerity measures on social divide.

Way Forward

Fiscal conditions in Sri Lanka left much to be desired even prior to the onset of the pandemic, and the pandemic has compounded the pre-existing maladies of the fiscal sector. Hence, fiscal consolidation remains the utmost priority to ensure stability and long term sustainable growth. Whilst economic recovery is underway, fiscal consolidation packages should be designed in a ‘growth-friendly’ manner by using

are possible solutions to cope with a surge in public debt (Reinhart & Sbrancia, 2011). However, long term financial repression could be detrimental to financial system stability as it creates tight liquidity conditions for banks and deteriorates banks’ balance sheets, especially when the Government is on a borrowing spree from domestic banks. On the other hand, allowing inflation to rise in the economy to increase nominal GDP and thereby improving the budget balance and debt to GDP ratio could be counterproductive, especially when market participants internalise higher inflation expectations in government securities yield rates, which in turn raise borrowing costs for the Government.

At present, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka conducts monetary policy under the Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) framework with the aim of maintaining inflation at low and stable levels in line with the Bank’s mandate for economic and price stability. Persistent fiscal deficit, high government debt levels, and the heavy reliance of the Government on the Central Bank for deficit financing in the recent times, however, have undermined the effective conduct of monetary policy while threatening the financial system stability. Although supply-side disruptions have stemmed from the acceleration in inflation during the latter part of 2021, breaching the upper bound of the county’s inflation target, demand fuelled mainly by increased credit to the Government by the banking sector has also been seen as a cause for the uptick in inflation. The economic history of Sri Lanka suggests that high inflation episodes in the country coincide with fiscal imbalances. Hence, in order to ensure long term price stability, fiscal consolidation remains to be a key condition.

Fiscal Consolidation Amidst an Economic Downturn

Drawing lessons from the rest of the world, alongside a tightened monetary policy stance, fiscal consolidation should be carefully designed and implemented without depressing the demand too much to circumvent scarring effects on the economy due to its fragile state. The standard Keynesian proposition suggests that fiscal consolidation, also called fiscal austerity, has a contractionary effect on economic activity in the short run. Accordingly, as a result of attempts for fiscal consolidation, a country’s fiscal performance may even deteriorate further due to lower revenue collection and lower nominal GDP following the slowdown in economic growth. Hence, as the economic growth of the country has already been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, fiscal consolidation during the pandemic period itself may be a greater concern for policymakers. However, persistent weak fiscal conditions have instigated a myriad of macroeconomic imbalances in the Sri Lankan economy, such as high inflation, weak currency and tight liquidity conditions of the banking

fiscal instruments that have small fiscal multipliers2 in order to ensure that the policy package is generating required fiscal effects with the lowest economic costs. To this end, a clear understanding of the fiscal policy transmission mechanism and the size of multipliers of different fiscal instruments, such as the disaggregated level fiscal multipliers related to different revenue and expenditure components, are required to design a consolidation package that has benign effects on output and inequalities.

Empirical evidence related to other countries suggest that expenditure based fiscal consolidation is less likely to be contractionary, as opposed to revenue based consolidation (Alesina, Favero, & Giavazzi, 2019). However, given the low tax revenue to GDP ratio, Sri Lanka still has space for manoeuvring fiscal consolidation through revenue policies with minimal disruptions on output. Successful revenue based fiscal consolidation measures in other countries, such as in Brazil, Canada, Finland, New Zealand, and South Africa, have focused on broadening the tax base and introducing reforms to simplify tax administration (Okwuokei, 2014). Since raising indirect tax rates such as Value Added Tax (VAT) could disproportionately affect consumption of low income households during these hard times, widening the VAT base (increasing the number of VAT paying businesses) would be the appropriate option to augment government revenue while minimising output and distributional effects. In this regard, the VAT free threshold could be revised downwards to the levels that prevailed prior to the last VAT threshold adjustment.3 Meanwhile, considering the modest impact on economic growth, taxes on capital income could be raised at the personal level.

Given the relatively sticky wage structures and rigid employment contracts in Sri Lanka, Advance Personal Income Tax (APIT)/ personal income tax rates could be raised to a level comparable to the country’s regional peers while adjusting tax free thresholds and tax brackets to the levels that prevailed prior to the last income tax revision, without causing notable impact on firms’ costs and labour input. More importantly, a range of administration and enforcement reforms is key to enhancing government revenue in the medium to long term by curbing tax evasion and corruption.

Past experiences of other countries suggest that fiscal austerity through expenditure reduction is more successful since expenditure cuts reflect greater commitment of the Government and efficiency gains (Price, 2010). Although a reduction in wages and transfers are proven to be more effective in fiscal consolidation in other countries, such a move will not be an easy feat in the Sri Lankan context given the associated political cost and stringent labour market conditions. Hence, at least, new government recruitments and major public wage revisions should be considered with caution along with better targeting of subsidies. On the other hand, the reduction in capital expenditure and expenditure on health and education could create more contractionary effects both in the short and long term, especially due to the country’s deficiencies in physical and soft infrastructure. Therefore, fiscal consolidation through sizeable capital expenditure cuts should be achieved through ‘value for money’ strategies, instead of across the board expense cuts. In this regard, the Central Government as well as local government authorities should streamline capital expenditure by selecting infrastructure projects that generate the highest economic value and future growth potential. Moreover, streamlining and digitalising

work processes, and trimming unproductive recurrent expenses are essential for efficiency gains and reducing the pressure on government expenditure.

Fiscal consolidation coupled with growth-promoting investments and long overdue structural reforms would be a welcome move in this dire economic situation to address the challenges and capitalise the opportunities presented by the pandemic. Since the debt burden of inefficient, loss-making State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs) translates into contingent liabilities of the Government, reforms related to SOBEs should be expeditiously implemented in tandem with fiscal austerity. Cost-reflective pricing mechanisms, institutional restructuring for efficiency gains, and market-oriented product and service delivery are several overdue reforms related to SOBEs. In addition, legislative and administrative reforms are required to monitor the progress of fiscal consolidation, strengthen public scrutiny over the consolidation process, and ensure accountability of the policymakers and government officials for meeting austerity targets. It may be noted that the continuous reliance of major SOBEs on the two state banks, and eventually on central bank financing, has created numerous challenges to price stability. Hence, SOBEs should be held accountable for their operations and such entities should not pass their debt burden on commercial banks and the Central Bank.

The Sri Lankan economy has reached a critical juncture where fiscal consolidation is imperative and any further delay in implementing the same effectively would be economically and politically very costly. However, the Government’s strong commitment to adhere to fiscal rules and the fiscal consolidation path is paramount for the actual realisation of desired outcome. Major impediments such as the lack of broad political consensus, lacklustre approach of authorities and resultant ‘stop-go’, short term and ad hoc policies should be wiped out to contain the derailment of the fiscal consolidation process. At the same time, as success and continuation of fiscal consolidation hinges on the support of the general public, creating awareness among the general public on the repercussions of the ‘subsidy mindset’ is of high significance to transform the voter-base to be more fiscally prudent, and in turn deter policymakers pursuing fiscal profligacy.

onset of the pandemic, causing severe hardships to

the public. According to the Census of Public and

Semi Government Sector Employment - 2016 report

of the Department of Census and Statistics, 33.2

per cent of the public sector employees are unable

to use a computer, while 30.4 per cent were not

skill gap of the public sector labour force deterring

the shift towards a technology intensive working

environment. However, experiences gained during

the pandemic also reveal that most government

services can be efficiently delivered using a fraction

of the existing labour force by reskilling and upskilling

them, and by introducing simple and people friendly

automated systems and virtual platforms. Going

forward, the public sector of Sri Lanka needs

to embrace new technologies to cater to the

dynamic needs and expectations of the population

by building better customer relations, improved

institutional coordination and data management,

and advanced evidence based policymaking.

Legislative and procedural amendments and

flexible working arrangements should also be

implemented in tandem with digitalisation to

ensure uninterrupted service delivery during the

disasters. The effectiveness of the service delivery

depends not only on technological enhancements,

but also on human capital, regulations, and

In addition, a strong legislative framework against

corruption coupled with adequate personnel and

funding for the strict enforcement of anti-corruption

measures have enabled Singapore to successfully

combat corruption and maintain a high level of

efficiency in the public sector. Moreover, public sector

recruitments that are in line with the administrative

approaches in budgeting, resource reallocation

from excessive sectors to needy sectors, planned

creating administrative flexibility for the workers

to move across different sectors within the public

in the Sri Lankan public sector.

The overreliance of the public sector on the

banking system, including the Central Bank to

source financial resources, needs to be scaled

down by exploring alternative sources of

financing and implementing long due structural

reforms enabling improvements to the financial

strength of the banking system. Apart from the

revenue earned by the public sector, bank financing

has been one of the key sources of financing for

both the Government and SOBEs. In recent years,

particularly since the onset of the pandemic, the

public sector, predominantly the Government, has

been increasingly relying on the banking system to

meet its financing requirements, thereby exerting

tremendous pressure on the banking sector,

especially the state banks, and domestic price

stability. The loss of access to international capital

markets amidst the rise in debt and sovereign

credit rating downgrades has aggravated the

funding constraints of the Government, while

SOBEs have been compelled to borrow from the

banking sector due to the inadequate adjustment

of administratively determined prices and tariffs of

their products, forcing them to continuously borrow

for working capital purposes. Such excessive

reliance of the public sector on bank financing

has put pressure on the domestic banking sector

and the overall domestic financial market, raising

financial system stability concerns as well. Further,

continued financing of the public sector without a

commensurate improvement in productivity and

efficiency, could in turn pose even higher inflationary

pressures, while increasingly becoming a burden on

the Government and taxpayers. Also, this would

lead to the crowding out of productivity bound

private sector investment, which could have adverse

implications on the long term growth potential of the

economy. The Government’s cashflows have been

severely affected by tax relaxations and exemptions

as well as limitations associated with tax collection.

Similarly, large overdue payments to some SOBEs,

particularly from other government entities and other

SOBEs, have also impacted cashflows forcing them

to obtain loans and overdrafts at high interest rates,

thereby affecting levels of profitability. This highlights

the need for the Government to actively explore

avenues to raise finance from non bank sources.

With regard to SOBEs, measures should be taken to

revise retail selling prices to reflect costs, while also

enhancing productivity, improving infrastructure,

reducing associated wastage to bring down the

overall cost of production and upgrade them as

autonomous entities, enabling them to operate on

their own without assistance from the government

budget. Further, immediate attention should be

given to improving the financial viability of SOBEs

by strengthening tariff collection, thereby enhancing

cashflow management, while also exploring

alternative low cost and long term financing options.

The implementation of the proposed reforms would

enhance public sector performance, thereby limiting

the need for banks’ support to meet the financing

needs of the public sector, facilitating near to

medium term economic stability and sustainable

growth in the long term.

The frequent volatility and persistence of

general price levels driven by food inflation,

which weakens the Central Bank’s efforts to

maintain inflation within the targeted range

and anchor inflation expectations, needs to be

controlled by government interventions on a

timely and sustainable basis. Since a large portion

of the consumer price basket of goods and services

consists of food items in Sri Lanka, frequent and

sizeable changes to the food prices cause volatility

in inflation. High, frequent and persistent deviations

of inflation from the inflation target mainly driven

by food inflation could derail inflation expectations,

thereby undermining the objectives of Flexible

Inflation Targeting (FIT). While supply side factors

largely trigger food price hikes in a country, demand

side factors could also complement such price hikes.

In Sri Lanka, supply driven factors, including the

pandemic and weather related supply disruptions, as

well as external factors such as large swings in global

food and commodity prices, were the main causes

of recent food inflation. Further, productivity losses

during the transition period to organic agriculture

practices and the legacy issues, such as post

harvest supply chain issues, limited storage, value

addition and preservation methodologies can also

be attributed to the acceleration in food prices. Food

prices driven inflation hikes are more regressive, as

they disproportionately affect less affluent sectors

of the society and deteriorate the living conditions

of the poor. Attempts to contain such supply driven

inflation mainly through monetary policy measures

could be counterproductive or ineffective. Hence,

implementing short to long term, well planned supply

side policies by the Government is imperative to

ensure the smooth functioning of domestic food

supply chains and to minimise the impact of upward

global price movements. These policies should

comprise improving domestic production, off season

cultivation, food storage infrastructure, adopting

preservation methodologies, minimising cost of

transportation, enhancing the technology used

in production and promoting cost effective import

substitution industries. Countries like India have

been able to soften their high food inflation through

implementing short term supply side measures such

as imposing stock limits, easing import restrictions,

reducing basic import duties, etc., in parallel with

successfully implementing the inflation targeting

framework. Although Sri Lanka has also taken such

short term policies within the limited fiscal space

available to address supply concerns, especially

related to transitory food price hikes, further

measures are required to maintain a robust and

resilient food supply chain in the country. During the

pandemic period, the Government took several short

term measures, such as removing travel restrictions

for those who are involved in the food supply chain to

continue their services. In the long run, appropriate

policies and infrastructure need to be in place

to invest in improving productivity in agriculture

and focus on food security issues. It will also be

important to obtain support from the private sector

in implementing these policies. The Government

has already initiated implementing infrastructure

and livelihood development programmes such as

“Vari Saubhagya” to ensure food safety through the

improvement of food production, while attempting to

promote the production of agricultural and industrial

goods that can be identified as import substitutes.

Further, it is important to have proper storage

systems with controlled environments in place to

reduce post harvest losses as well as for off season

storage. While the investments from the international

and domestic private sector would expand storage

and goods transportation facilities within the country,

the establishment of food banks will aid to make use

of regional food reserves in emergency situations.

Among other measures, it would be worthwhile to

have a specialised preparedness team consisting

of both government and private sectors to detect

possible developments leading to supply shortage

of essential food items early and make proactive

policy recommendations to the Government to

45

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

help prepare the economy to face likely shocks to

food supply. Moreover, it is vital to have a robust

regulatory framework on the functioning of food

supply chains from the agriculture sector to the

retail sector to avoid monopolies, undue dumping

of stocks and subsequent price hikes, thereby

reducing volatilities in food prices. Less volatility in

food inflation in shaping inflation dynamics, by way

of anchoring inflation expectations will help achieve

and maintain price stability.

Export industries need to build the capacity

and resilience to withstand risks posed by

the pandemic, and global issues that affect

global markets and commodity prices, while

forming strategies to grow and diversify.

Export industries, which were significantly

affected when the pandemic initially broke out

in 2020, recovered within a short time span and

recorded a notable growth to historically highest

ever export earnings in 2021. As the pandemic

intensified and continued, the main concerns for

the exports were the changes to demand patterns,

international maritime disturbances that resulted

in a surge in costs along with lack of vessels and

containers, mobility restrictions that disrupted

production and transport, the difficulty in sourcing

certain inputs, and the notable increase in the

cost of raw materials. Nevertheless, some export

categories performed well starting from the latter

part of 2020 (mainly agricultural exports), while

other export categories have only partly recovered

thus far. However, uncertainties still linger in the

international economy arising from the continuation

of the pandemic, monetary policy normalisation

in major economies, high commodity prices,

energy market issues and the recent geopolitical

tensions. Notwithstanding these difficulties, Sri

Lanka needs to identify that developing the export

sector during the ‘new normal’ as a policy priority

to increase non debt inflows and would accelerate

growth through the allocation of resources to

the productive tradeable sector in the economy.

External sector policies should not only focus on

the need for diversifying export markets but also

on the improved sophistication of export products

to more technologically advanced, high quality

and high value goods and services. Diversifying

into new export sectors with potential for higher

domestic value addition such as Information and IT/

BPO, electricals and electronics, processed food,

beverages, spices and concentrates, boatbuilding

and after sales services and pharmaceuticals, need

to be explored and supported through policies.

The exports sector would have to be supported by

conducive macroeconomic policies of the country,

particularly through maintaining a flexible exchange

rate, consistent tax and investment policies and

essential infrastructure facilities.

Adoption of stronger industrial policies and

strategies is necessary to ensure the availability

of essential goods in the country, develop import

substitution industries and to increase export

earnings. Even though Sri Lanka has been a trade

dependent economy for the past several decades,

the pandemic, the consequent global supply chain

issues and the current geopolitical tensions have

shown that it would be difficult for a country that

suffers from macroeconomic vulnerabilities to rely

heavily on other countries to secure an uninterrupted

supply of food and essential goods through

international trade, particularly during times of crisis.

The need for import substitution, at least for selected

essential goods that could be produced domestically

was felt strongly in the midst of difficulties to import

and shortages of goods in domestic markets. Such

essential goods include food, pharmaceuticals,

inputs that are necessary for industries, construction

material and machinery. The Government’s efforts

to develop the agricultural sector by discouraging

imports, forming plans to establish a pharmaceuticals

manufacturing zone, a textile manufacturing park,

etc., are commendable efforts in this regard.

46

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

Policies to promote backward integration of value

chains of major export sectors also support this. On

the other hand, carefully designed and strategised

substitution policies could save foreign exchange

for the country. Against this background, there is a

new wave of import substitution like policies adopted

by many other countries, especially after the global

pandemic. It was observed that large economies

such as China, India, the USA and several African

countries attempted to promote domestic production

recently by discouraging imports. Further, attracting

FDI not only for export oriented manufacturing, but

also for identified backward integration sectors may

also support higher control over the value chains,

while effectively substituting imports. However,

pursuing strong and continuous efforts focusing

on industrialisation under a comprehensive and

long lasting industrial policy, which is also linked to

agricultural policies, remains vital and urgent.

The export sectors development should

not rely heavily on free/preferential trade

agreements. Sri Lanka has preferential export

access to several foreign markets through eleven

Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) schemes

(including the EU GSP+). Meanwhile, Sri Lanka

has entered into seven multilateral and bilateral

trade agreements, which allow preferential access

to foreign markets under concessions. At the same

time, efforts are underway to negotiate and enter into

free/ preferential trade agreements with some trading

partners with high future potential such as China,

Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, and Bangladesh.

Although trade agreements generally focus on tariffs

and quotas, their scope has recently expanded to

include services exports, intellectual property rights

and patent rules, health and safety regulations,

labour and environmental standards, investments,

and banking. In the case of GSP schemes, countries

implementing them provide non reciprocal preferential

market access to selected counterparty countries

and Sri Lanka is a beneficiary of such schemes. The

beneficiary status of some GSP schemes depends

on criteria such as low GDP per capita and conditions

stipulated by the granting country such as good

governance requirements, labour standards, and

environmental factors. As the GDP per capita of Sri

Lanka increases, Sri Lanka stands to lose eligibility

for some of these schemes. Trade agreements and

GSP schemes also encompass rigorous Rules of

Origin requirements and hence should have high

value addition within Sri Lanka. Therefore, a number

of exports that utilise these trade agreements are

limited to agricultural exports and industrial goods

that depend on local inputs, such as rubber products.

It is difficult for exports, which use imported inputs

to a great extent, to meet stringent Rules of Origin

criteria. Hence, even for apparel, which is Sri Lanka’s

main export, the utilisation rate of schemes such as

the EU GSP+ is not high, compared to goods such

as rubber products, toys, and agricultural exports.

It is evident that when Sri Lanka lost the EU GSP+

status between August 2010 and May 2017, exports

to the EU did not decline considerably. Despite these

concerns, some exports enjoy significant benefits

through low tariffs under these schemes/agreements.

As a result, out of total export earnings in 2021,

about 43 per cent were earned through exports

under the preferential trade agreements, including

GSP schemes. However, the fact that a large share

of export earnings to Sri Lanka have been earned

under trade agreements does not necessarily mean

that such agreements were the single main reason

for the reported increase in exports. Such exports

may be incentivised by other factors pertaining to

the exporting entity, domestic economic factors,

and global market factors. Meanwhile, the trade

agreements of other countries such as the Regional

Comprehensive Economic Partnership (“RCEP”

entered into by 30 countries in East Asia, Southeast

Asia and Oceania), also raise questions about

Sri Lanka’s future competitiveness. Although the

benefits of trade agreements and GSP schemes on

Sri Lanka’s exports have been significant, it would

47

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

be prudent to reduce the dependency on such

trade agreements or schemes, while considering

successful integration with global value chains and

diversification of exported goods, while broadening

the export market. However, free/preferential trade

agreements must be entered into only if the potential

increase in exports or cost saving from imports

can be identified and justified. Nevertheless, rather

than relying too much on duty concessions, export

promotion policies need to focus on exporting

improved quality goods with high value addition at

lower costs of production, achieved through research

and development led innovation, over the medium to

long term.

The increased demand for higher education

abroad and the significantly high foreign

exchange outlay highlight the need for urgently

addressing issues pertaining to higher

education opportunities available domestically.

Despite the commitment of successive governments

to the provision of free education and upgrading

of infrastructure related to the provision of higher

education, a large number of qualified students

remain outside the ambit of the public education

system at the graduate and postgraduate levels. In

2020, although approximately 63 per cent of those

who sat for GCE Advanced Level examination

were eligible to enter the public tertiary education

system, only 22 per cent of the qualified students

were admitted into the system, in spite of the

recent increases in intakes. Accordingly, the limited

number of opportunities available in the domestic

public and private higher education systems has

translated into students steadily departing for

higher education abroad. A key issue in this regard

is the substantial outflow of foreign exchange,

which could also add pressure to the prevailing

imbalances in the external sector. Moreover,

as the economy integrates more into the global

economy, it is expected that the domestic labour

force would have to transform to cater to the

dynamic demands of a modern work environment.

Especially, when the IT/BPO sector is expected

to expand into a US dollars 5 billion industry and

as Sri Lanka continues to strive to attract FDI,

the availability of a pool of skilled labour with

internationally recognised qualifications will be

essential. Similarly, new employment opportunities

that will be created in the Colombo Port City and

International Financial City would also require such

a pool of skilled people. Accordingly, improving

the opportunities for domestic education at the

international standard will help to improve the

required skills of the workforce while enabling to

retain the talent within the country to some extent,

along with further expansion in the services sector.

Therefore, focused policy initiatives to improve the

standards of local universities, alongside capacity

improvements, are essential not only to retain

domestic students but also to attract international

students from foreign shores. Further, it is also

important for private higher education institutions

to focus on building ‘university-class’ infrastructure

comprising accommodation facilities, social

activities, specialised research and laboratory

facilities, among others. Such initiatives will not

only contribute to improving standards of learning

delivery, but also to the overall learning experience

which is also a key point of attraction for students

who are currently emigrating for higher education.

The Government may consider facilitating an

expansion in the private higher education sector

with increased collaborations with the world class

universities along with international accreditation.

Further, facilitating foreign based universities to

establish branch universities in Sri Lanka would be

a welcome move to attract international students

to its shores as a study abroad destination, while

accommodating local students to study from

renowned foreign institutions while being on

shores. It is also required to attract world class

faculty members under a residential visa scheme

to enrich the quality of education provision by

48

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

1

internationally accredited educational institutions.

Such an arrangement would enhance FDI flows

and bring in technical and technological know-how.

Such initiatives can facilitate the country’s ongoing

efforts to emerge as a leading provider of IT/BPO

solutions as it would enable elevating the quantity

and quality of labour produced to cater to this

industry and serve to attract international students

who can later continue here as ‘digital nomads’.

This can pave the way for an overall improvement in

access to higher education without the Government

having to bear the entire burden of such expansion,

while also enabling the higher education sector to

emerge as a key foreign exchange earning sector

in the future.

Despite the transformation of the agriculture

sector since independence, Sri Lanka continues

to grapple with the creation of a sustainable

agriculture sector that is capable of generating

healthy income levels while ensuring food

security and efficient ecosystem management

to enhance the overall productivity of the sector.

The agriculture drive in the 1960s to develop the

agriculture sector to fulfil the growing demands

of the economy entailed the rapid introduction of

high yielding crop varieties alongside increased

usage of chemical fertilisers as well as other agro-

chemical inputs under a fertiliser subsidy scheme. In

subsequent periods, Sri Lanka continued to provide

fertiliser concessions to farmers by way of cash grants

or issuance of fertiliser free of charge or at a rate below

market value with the view to ensuring sustained

increases in production. In turn, the continuation

of such concessions to farmers alongside poor

extension services, and lack of farmer awareness

have led to excessive use of chemical or inorganic

materials in the agriculture production process,

thus creating long term negative effects on human

wellbeing, health and ecosystems, in addition to the

associated expenditure burden on the fiscal front.

Also, the abundance of low cost chemical fertiliser

at below market prices in the country has prevented

farmers from using organic manure as well as other

organic and sustainable agriculture practices in

cultivation given the labour and time intensity of such

practices. The use of organic fertiliser can always

generate multiple benefits to growers, consumers

as well as the environment. It supports nutrient

and water retention, and thereby soil fertility, while

maintaining soil biodiversity. However, excessive

usage of chemical fertiliser and non-usage of

organic fertiliser and soil conservation practices in

the agriculture systems in Sri Lanka have resulted

in the weakening of the natural environment through

soil degradation, pollution of ground and surface

water, eutrophication, and disruption of aquatic

ecosystems. Meanwhile, the excessive usage of

agrochemicals is also expected to cause significant

negative impacts on biodiversity, while also creating

direct and indirect health hazards. Accordingly,

there is an urgent need for devising a long term

policy framework targeted at promoting sustainable

agriculture, which will ensure economic profitability,

social and economic equity as well as environmental

health. While recognising the Government’s efforts

to promote organic fertiliser with a view to limiting

the excessive use of synthetic manure in agriculture,

it must be noted that only a holistic strategy that

encompasses all the elements related to sustainable

agriculture could ensure the fulfilment of the needs

of the present generation without compromising the

needs of future generations. This is also essential

considering the fact that almost one-third of

Sri Lanka’s labour force is engaged in the agriculture

sector and many of their livelihoods are consistently

vulnerable owing to the sector’s lack of resilience

to the shocks. In this regard, the Government must

facilitate the creation of a sustainable agriculture

base that will enable farmers to capitalise on

these sustainable and climate smart agricultural

practices. Accordingly, urgent measures focusing

on establishing a precision agriculture system

that would encourage the optimal use of inputs in

49

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

agriculture are needed. Under such approach, the

promotion of organic fertiliser, while encouraging

efficient and optimal use of chemical fertiliser

remains of utmost importance. Given the frequent

drought spells experienced by the country in recent

times, efficient management of water should also

be promoted through reduced volume irrigation

systems such as drip irrigation and the introduction of

drought tolerant crop species. Also, major emphasis

should be given to soil conservation strategies to

ensure long term soil productivity in agricultural

lands and to minimise landslide hazards. At the

same time, addressing the issues of growing food

demand, climate change as well as limited arable

land, it is vital to promote innovative ways of farming,

including vertical farming and urban farming, while

mechanising agriculture activities in the traditional

agriculture sector. Meanwhile, the promotion of

domestic production of fertiliser, agrochemicals as

well as seeds is essential in achieving sustainability

in agriculture since the country is highly reliant on

imported seeds, fertilisers, and agrochemicals.

Towards the endeavour of building a sustainable

agriculture sector, creating awareness of

sustainable, climate smart and good agriculture

practices among all the stakeholders would enable

a faster transition. Moreover, a well developed and a

coherent mechanism with a suitable transition period

is essential to transform the present agriculture

system of Sri Lanka into a sustainable system, while

ensuring that the full benefits of such a transition are

passed on to all those engaged in the agricultural

supply chains.

Despite being a key driver of economic

growth and having more potential for further

growth, Micro, Small and Medium sized

Enterprises (MSMEs) in Sri Lanka face numerous

hindrances, thus necessitating policy priorities

at the national level. More than 99 per cent of

establishments in the non agricultural sector in

Sri Lanka are found to be MSMEs, contributing

to about 75 per cent of employment within the

non agriculture sector.3 Different studies report

the contribution of MSMEs to economic activity in

Sri Lanka to be more than 50 per cent. However,

this appears to be relatively low when compared

to developed nations and even some developing

economies. These observations suggest that

despite the existence of a large number of MSMEs in

Sri Lanka, their economic contribution may not have

reached its potential yet. Over several decades,

MSMEs in Sri Lanka endured difficult circumstances

due to various reasons including natural disasters,

terrorist activities, health crises, etc. In order to

support MSMEs during such periods, for example,

during the pandemic, the Government and the

Central Bank provided a substantial package of

financial and non-financial reliefs similar to many

other countries. Nevertheless, a considerable

number of businesses and individuals in this sector

may not have recovered or even explored the

potential of such support schemes. It has been

identified that several issues have hindered the

progress of the MSME sector, including insufficient

access to finance as well as poor financial literacy.

Many MSMEs do not possess the required financial

literacy to prepare project proposals with sufficient

information required by financial institutions, while

financial reporting remains relatively weak among

these entrepreneurs, thereby forcing financial

institutions to rely on collateral based selection, which

restricts the ability of MSMEs to obtain loans due to

their inherently small asset base, in turn driving them

to utilise the services of informal lenders as well.

Considering the difficulties encountered by MSMEs

when securing finance for their projects amidst a lack

of sufficiently acceptable collateral, the Government

in consultation with several stakeholders embarked

on an initiative to set up a Credit Guarantee Institution

(CGI), which was a long overdue requirement. With

the implementation of the CGI, the funding concerns

3 As reported in the Economic Census 2013/2014, conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics.

50

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

1

of MSMEs are expected to ease, to some extent, and

enhance their prospects as well as their contribution

to overall economic activity, going forward. The

expeditious operationalisation of the CGI would

immensely support the MSME sector to thrive.

Meanwhile, the establishment of a well functioning

development bank is also a necessity to support

small businesses in the country, and this has been

highlighted for several years. Further, the possibility

of adopting and popularising alternative funding

avenues for MSMEs that have been successful in

various countries, such as crowdfunding, venture

capital investments, pitch competitions, etc. also

needs to be explored. At the same time, MSMEs

can benefit from improving awareness of equity

finance opportunities, such as those facilitated by

the CSE via its Empower Board. Other impediments

that limit MSMEs from reaching their true potential

include, low levels of managerial skills, use of

outdated technology and the resulting low quality

of output, limited market knowledge, information

asymmetry, and certain cultural perceptions that are

less conducive to entrepreneurial development. A

close look at some of these factors highlights that

these are interconnected issues which reinforce

each other, requiring collective effort to overcome

them successfully. Although the multitude of

initiatives undertaken by the Government and

other agencies have helped many individuals and

businesses to overcome some of these issues,

MSMEs operating in Sri Lanka still have substantial

space for improvement. It is important to continue

the efforts undertaken to strengthen managerial

and entrepreneurial skills and to improve financial

literacy among Sri Lankan MSMEs. The provision of

business consultancy and credit advisory services

by both Government and non government agencies

need to be enhanced, while such services could be

offered and popularised via special units in financial

institutions as well, ultimately leading to financial

arrangements. Further, developing marketing

opportunities, both domestically and internationally,

is vital for the success of MSMEs, while enabling

supply chain integrations with large businesses will

help improve the resilience of the sector. At the same

time, a holistic effort is needed from all stakeholders

to improve the use of new technology by MSMEs, so

that the quality of their output is improved and their

access to markets is enhanced. It is also important

to improve coordination among various arms of

the Government and non government agencies,

which provide support to MSMEs to improve their

effectiveness. Improving awareness of these various

support elements is essential so that businesses

and individuals can easily reach them when needed.

At the same time, the entire MSME sector would

benefit from a well coordinated grievance handling

mechanism operating at a district or divisional

secretariat level, which would contribute to easing

operating difficulties faced by them and could serve

as a conduit for the escalation of any major issues

to higher levels to be addressed through appropriate

policies. Further, efforts to minimise long standing

impediments in the doing business environment

of the country would undoubtedly help the MSME

sector as well, while facilitating improvements

across all business activities in the economy.

Despite several policy initiatives, Sri Lanka

continues to struggle with waste management

issues that have been further amplified by the

COVID-19 pandemic. In recent years, Sri Lanka has

been in the spotlight regarding its waste management

practices, especially with the garbage landslide

disaster in Meethotamulla in 2017 and more recent

incidents of wildlife being affected by open waste

dumps. Despite there being several national and micro

level initiatives and goals regarding the improvement

of waste management practices, there has been a

consistent lag in the effective implementation of such

initiatives. Further, the outbreak of the COVID-19

pandemic and the resultant increase in healthcare

waste such as masks, Personal Protective Equipment

(PPE), gloves, handkerchiefs, tissues, sanitary

51

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

pads, diapers, and other materials contaminated

by body fluids of patients, disposed from healthcare

institutions, quarantine centres and households

has become a serious concern as such ‘single-use’

items are unlikely to reduce in the periods ahead.

The National Audit Report on Healthcare Waste

Management - 2019 highlights that approximately 70

per cent of the audited hospitals were not complying

with healthcare waste management standards during

the pre-pandemic period. This poses significant

contemporary risks as nonadherence to healthcare

waste management standards and inappropriate

disposal of hazardous and infectious waste create

serious threats to the environment, public health,

and biodiversity. In addition to the substantial

increase in clinical waste from designated COVID-19

hospitals and treatment centres, there has been an

increase in the open burning of clinical waste during

the pandemic period. Despite the Government’s

initiatives to address these concerns through the

issuance of guidelines for healthcare facilities and

increased resources for clinical waste handling,

healthcare facilities still face significant resource and

technical limitations such as limited waste storage,

transportation and incineration facilities. In addition

to the expeditious completion of the Metro Colombo

Solid Waste Management Project, it will also be

essential to focus on establishing waste to energy

power plants, one of which was commenced in early

2021 with a generation capacity of 10 MW. The

construction of such power plants has been delayed

due to high levels of capital outlay associated with

such projects. However, the timely establishment of

these projects can be a cornerstone solution not only

to the country's solid waste management problems

but also to the country’s electricity needs. Global

trends highlight that there is immense potential to

attract FDI and even multilateral funding to waste

management and recycling projects as investors

and donor agencies are looking for opportunities for

returns while also contributing to global sustainability

initiatives through such greenfield projects. Proper

implementation of an efficient waste collection

mechanism, upgrading of existing disposal practices

as well as the provision of adequate mechanical

and biological treatment facilities, are imperative to

address the country's growing waste management

issue. Accordingly, there is a dire need for continued

commitment to multi sectoral initiatives focused not

only on recycling and composting waste, but also

on reducing waste and encouraging reuse thereby

paving the way for the creation of both sustainable

development in the short term and transitioning to a

circular economy over the long term.

Focusing on ‘green’ development remains

a critical contemporary need to ensure that Sri

Lanka’s natural resources are better conserved

and restored so that the economy can reap the

full potential of its ecosystem. There is widespread

consensus on the need for striking a balance

between economic growth derived through resource

consumption and conservation of the environment

to preserve the existing natural resources, thereby

addressing the issue of climate change. In recent

years, there have been significant concerns about the

impact of climate change with the frequent occurrences

of natural disasters such as flooding and landslides,

and drought conditions, among others. A recent study

by the World Bank highlights that the temperature

rise in Sri Lanka is projected to be only marginally

lower than the global average indicating that periods

of extreme heat will increase and stay persistent in

the future. Such temperature increases can pose

a threat to the well-being of the people, especially

those in dry areas, and have direct implications on

the economy, especially in relation to agricultural

productivity, labour productivity and energy security.

The study also highlights Sri Lanka’s vulnerability to

potential increases in the frequency and intensity of

extreme precipitation events, such as the torrential

rains, which could render significant risks to lives,

livelihoods and infrastructure due to the resultant

floods and landslides that may occur. The largest

52

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

1

impact of such volatilities stemming from the natural

environment will be on the poorest and marginalised

communities, particularly the large segment of

the population engaged in agriculture. Amid such

concerns, several other issues continue to affect the

quality of natural environments in the country such as

the decades long human elephant conflicts, incidents

of sand mining, the release of hazardous waste to

water bodies by industries, forest destruction and

the recent X-Press Pearl Maritime disaster. All these

environmental concerns will have lasting, persistent,

and potentially recurring negative socioeconomic

implications. This emphasises the urgent need for

committing to forward-looking and holistic policy

initiatives that will pave way for sustainable natural

resource management. Continuous monitoring of the

status of natural resources is an essential aspect,

which needs to be strengthened through a stringent

regulatory and legal framework that ensures the

prevention of environmental and natural resource

crimes such as illegal logging, poaching and even

Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing,

which are rarely prosecuted. The Government and the

Central Bank should also work together to promote

sustainable finance practices in Sri Lanka that will be

instrumental in routing credit towards environmentally

friendly businesses.

Despite the country’s efforts to achieve its

target of alleviating all forms of malnutrition

by 2030, as declared under the Sustainable

Development Goals (SDGs), developments

pertaining to COVID-19 and other supply side

shocks observed recently in relation to agricultural

commodities may threaten the outcomes achieved

thus far, while posing hindrances to long term

development. Although Sri Lanka made remarkable

progress in achieving many of the national level

targets under the Millennium Development Goals

(MDGs) to uplift the socioeconomic wellbeing of the

community by 2015, performance across the targets

set for nutrition continued to remain unachievable

reflecting the prevalence of nutrition related anomalies

across geographical regions and economic sectors.

As per the Demographic and Health Survey – 2016

of the DCS, some malnutrition related indicators

such as stunting (height for age), wasting (weight for

height), prevalence of obesity (weight for age) as well

as low birth weight continued to remain unachieved

compared to the national targets set for improving

maternal, infant and child nutrition, with the estate

sector showing the poorest nutritional outcomes.

Such disparities and concerns are likely to have been

aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021,

Sri Lanka’s Child Multidimensional Poverty Indicator

(CMPI) indicated that about 42.2 per cent of children

aged between 0-4 years old were multidimensionally

poor with 33.4 per cent experiencing deprivations

in relation to nutrition. Further, the recent supply

side shocks observed regarding the availability and

affordability of food, stemming from both global and

domestic developments, raises concerns about

long term impacts on nutritional outcomes of the

population, especially children and women. The

high levels of food inflation that occur occasionally

may have scarring impacts on the future productivity

of the population, if allowed to persist. It must be

noted that the Government’s provision of cash

transfers and food distribution programmes targeting

households below the poverty line is expected

to have cushioned the negative impact on the

nutrition status of such households to some extent.

This reiterates the importance of the adoption of

a holistic policy approach comprising near to long

term strategies to ensure food security. Such policy

initiatives should not only focus on availability through

improved productivity in the agriculture sector but

also post harvest marketing and distribution. As part

of initiatives that are underway to improve domestic

production, there is a need to strengthen databases

relating to both national demand and domestic

supply, especially for essential food commodities.

Realistic and timely forward looking assessments

on the part of relevant institutions in the agricultural

sector are essential for proactive planning and timely

implementation of remedial measures to safeguard

the food security status and overall wellbeing of the

population. It is to be noted that in the past, Sri Lanka

received the assistance of multilateral donor agencies

to strengthen the agriculture sector and food security

status of the country. Despite Sri Lanka’s progression

into the middle income status, multilateral assistance

in this regard, such as through the UN’s World

Food Programme, the World Bank and the Asian

Development Bank is widely available. Tapping

into such sources, both for funding and to improve

technical capacity in relation to data collection,

analysis, and monitoring, may not only contribute to

improving the nutritional status of the population but

also improve the resilience of the agriculture sector

and augment the food security status of the country

in the long term.

The largely stagnant levels of female labour

force participation observed in Sri Lanka for the

past three decades highlight that a significant

portion of the labour force remains outside the

ambit of the economy’s growth and development

processes, warranting urgent attention as the

economy attempts to rapidly recover from the

effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and progress

onto a higher growth trajectory. Sri Lanka took

almost four decades to double its female labour force

participation rate from about 19 per cent in 1953 to

36 per cent in 1990. Since then, the female labour

force participation rate has averaged just 33 per cent

and has been on a declining trend in recent years.

Although, Sri Lanka is ahead of the South Asian

average of 24 per cent, the country’s female labour

force participation remains much lower than the

‘upper middle income’ country average of 55 per cent.

The continued stagnation of the female labour force

participation is a key policy issue to be addressed

as the economy struggles with a rapidly ageing

population, labour productivity issues and increasing

migration, especially of skilled and semi skilled

workers. With due consideration for considerable

investments that consecutive governments have

made in the education and health sector over the last

seven decades, it is noted that bringing women into the

labour force and thereby creating an expansion of the

labour force can have significant positive impacts on

the growth process of the country, while also ensuring

the efficacy of such investments, amid limited fiscal

space. Initiatives in this regard should also focus

on ensuring that women avail of ‘decent work’,4 as

outlined in the SDGs. The need to engage women

in ‘decent work’ is underscored by the developments

arising due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has

caused a rise in the socioeconomic vulnerability of

women as they tend to be employed in vulnerable

jobs in the services or agriculture sectors and are

more likely to be underpaid or engaged under less

favourable working terms. Since long, there has

been a broad consensus that policies focused on

alleviating the ‘triple burden’ of women and thereby

enhancing female labour force participation are

lacking in Sri Lanka. This is evident from the dearth in

the availability of affordable and regulated childcare

or elderly care facilities, the absence of flexible

working arrangements and the lack of reliable and

safe modes of public transportation – international

experiences highlight these as essential to improve

the female labour force participation. Developing

such infrastructure can lead to better absorption of

females into the labour force thereby paving way for

an increase in overall welfare through the increase in

the productive resource base of the economy. Over

the medium term, the higher levels of household

incomes can translate into improved education and

nutritional outcomes for future generations, thereby

contributing to consistent improvements in the

productivity of the labour force. Accordingly, it is vital

to devise a targeted, holistic and multi sectoral policy

initiative that supports stronger diversity and inclusion

in a gender sensitive manner.

4 The International Labour Organization (ILO) defines decent work as ‘productive work for women and men in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity’.

Against this backdrop, committed efforts of

the Government and all stakeholders in defying

the looming dire economic consequences and

keeping the economy floating with a sense

of urgency, while addressing the structural

issues remain the immediate priority to

achieve sustainable growth and to preserve

macroeconomic stability going forward.

While the COVID-19 pandemic has uncovered

unprecedented opportunities to implement bold

and better coordinated policy reforms, with the

support of an external engagement, such as an

economic adjustment programme supported by

the IMF, exploring undiscovered new challenges,

and addressing such challenges without delays

through concerted efforts remain extremely vital

at this juncture in order to reap tangible and

broad-based benefits to the economy for robust

macroeconomic stability and growth outlook,

which will also ensure fulfilling the expectations of

the general public at large.

2.1 OverviewT

he Sri Lankan economy rebounded by 3.7 per cent in 2021, recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic induced fall back of 3.6 per cent in 2020, amid fresh threats from new variants of the pandemic. The recovery could be observed across all three major economic activities, namely Agriculture, Industry and Services, propelled by the pent-up demand and the gradual easing of pandemic-related disturbances, and also aided by the favourable base effect that resulted from the significant contraction in the economy in 2020. Nonetheless, the fast spread of the highly infectious Delta variant put the recovery at risk, particularly during the third quarter of the year, adversely affecting Services and Industry activities. While grappling with renewed flare-ups, focused mobility restrictions coupled with policy stimuli and the countrywide vaccination rollout encouraged embracing a normal routing and provided more room for economic activities towards the latter part of the year. Amid the fast adaptation towards the 'new normal', several labour market indicators also improved during 2021 compared to 2020, yet the labour market has not reached the pre-pandemic levels of 2019 due to the ripple effects of the recurrent waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, employed population, especially in the Services and Agriculture sectors and the labour force improved, while the unemployment rate declined during 2021 compared to the previous year. With this backdrop, Services activities entered a growth trajectory fuelled by the expansion in financial services, and wholesale and retail trade activities. Meanwhile, the considerable rebound in manufacturing activities with the pent-up demand, locally and globally, provided the impetus to drive Industry activities. In the meantime, an overall expansion was observed in Agriculture activities. However, certain Agriculture and Industry activities were adversely affected by the supply-side bottlenecks that prevailed, particularly during the second half of the year. The short supply of required nutrients and agrochemicals for farming led to a lower yield in agricultural crops towards the latter part of the year, despite the favourable weather prevailed. Further, business surveys revealed that soaring raw material prices and delays in shipments coupled with foreign exchange shortage gummed up the supply chain, thereby disrupting production plans. Particularly, the full potential of the construction industry was largely hindered by the inadequacy of key materials. Meanwhile, on the expenditure front, both consumption and investment expenditure picked up in 2021, with the gradual normalisation of economic activities in the country. However, net external demand further contracted during the year as the surge in imports outstripped the growth in exports. Meanwhile, the national savings-investment gap as a percentage of GDP widened during the year, largely due to the higher growth

in investment expenditure.

the year. Accordingly, the GDP implicit deflator

increased to 7.9 per cent in 2021, from 4.0 per cent

recorded in 2020.

GNI, which is estimated by adjusting GDP

for the net primary income from the rest of the

world, recorded a growth of 12.3 per cent at

current prices in 2021, compared to the marginal

growth of 0.3 per cent recorded in 2020. This

growth in GNI was largely due to the decline in

negative balance of net primary income on top of

the significant increase in GDP at current prices in

2021, compared to last year.

GDP per capita increased to Rs. 758,680

(US dollars 3,815) in 2021, compared to

Rs. 685,587 (US dollars 3,695) in 2020. The increase

in GDP per capita in rupee terms was mainly on

account of the growth in GDP at current prices, while

the slower increase in GDP per capita in US dollar

terms was due to the weakening of the domestic

currency against the US dollar on an annual average

basis. Meanwhile, GNI per capita was estimated at

Rs. 740,328 (US dollars 3,722) in 2021, compared to

Rs. 666,285 (US dollars 3,591) in 2020.

2.3 Contribution from

Institutional Sectors

In 2021, the largest contribution to Gross

Value Added (GVA) estimated at current market

prices continued to be from the Households

and Non-Profit Institutions Serving Households

(HH and NPISH) sector. The HH and NPISH sector

sustained the largest contribution to Agriculture

and Services activities, while Industry activities

were dominated by the Non-Financial Corporations

(NFC) sector. Accordingly, representing 48.0 per

cent of the overall GVA of the economy, the HH

and NPISH sector grew by 10.2 per cent in 2021

compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, the

NFC sector recorded a growth of 15.2 per cent.

The General Government (GG) and Financial

Corporations (FC) sectors recorded growth rates

of 5.4 per cent and 19.0 per cent, respectively, in

2021.

2.4 Output, Policies, Institutional Support and Issues

Agriculture

Agriculture activities recorded an expansion

of 2.0 per cent in 2021 in value-added terms,

recovering from the contraction of 2.2 per cent

recorded in 2020, mainly on account of the

expansion in coconut and animal production

activities. Further, the growing of tea, spices,

forestry and logging, and growing of other cereals

also expanded during the year, contributing

favourably to the growth in overall agricultural

activities. Meanwhile, fishing activities also recorded

a moderate growth in 2021, recovering from the

significant contraction recorded in 2020. However,

the growing of rice, fruits, vegetables, other perennial

crops, rubber and other beverage crops (coffee,

cocoa, etc.) contracted during the year. Even though

Agriculture activities recorded an expansion during the

year, the lack of relevant nutrients and agrochemicals

prevented it from reaching its full potential particularly

during the second half of the year.

Agriculture Production Index

The Agriculture Production Index (API),

which measures the output of the agriculture

and fisheries sectors,2 recorded a moderate

increase in 2021. The API increased by 3.0 per cent

during the year over a 2.7 per cent increase in 2020

driven by the growth in most of the sub-indices,

including paddy, tea, coconut, livestock and fisheries,

whereas the rubber sub index witnessed a contraction

in comparison to the previous year.

Paddy

The paddy sector recorded a high level of

production in 2021, with a bumper harvest

during the 2021 Yala season. Conducive weather

conditions and an increase in the net extent

harvested contributed to the increased production

2 API does not cover the forestry and logging sector

during the year. Accordingly, total paddy production

recorded a bumper harvest for the second

consecutive year in 2021, with a marginal increase

in harvest compared to the previous year. Paddy

production during the year grew by 0.6 per cent,

on a year-on-year basis, to 5.1 million metric tons.

Notably, the decline of 4.2 per cent in production

of 2020/2021 Maha season was greatly offset by

the growth of 8.5 per cent recorded in the 2021

Yala season. The net extent harvested expanded

by 2.8 per cent to 681,521 hectares and 10.3 per

cent to 445,084 hectares in the 2020/2021 Maha

and 2021 Yala seasons, respectively, resulting in

an overall increase of 5.6 per cent in the total net

extent harvested over 2020. Despite the overall

improvement in production during the year, the

paddy yield per hectare during the 2020/2021

Maha season and 2021 Yala season decreased by

6.8 per cent to 4,492 kilogrammes per hectare and

1.6 per cent to 4,692 kilogrammes per hectare,

respectively, over the corresponding periods of 2020,

raising concerns about the sufficiency of supplies of

inputs, including fertiliser and other agrochemicals,

and poor soil and crop management practices. The

total paddy production from both the Maha and

Yala seasons was equivalent to 3.3 million metric

tons of rice, which was estimated to be sufficient to

meet the domestic demand for rice approximately

for 17 months.3 Despite sufficient production, rice

imports registered a notable increase from 15,770

metric tons in 2020 to 147,091 metric tons in 2021,

of which around 134,716 metric tons of rice were

imported during the months of November and

December 2021. Rice imports were undertaken with

the intention of stabilising the upward volatilities in

rice prices observed in the domestic market and

also to ensure that a sufficient buffer stock was

maintained.

Despite sufficient levels of paddy production

and higher rice imports, prices of paddy and rice

varieties remained notably high throughout the

year. The average price of Samba paddy recorded

a significant increase of 29.2 per cent reaching

Rs. 65.32 per kilogramme during 2021, while the

average price of Nadu paddy also increased by

20.7 per cent to Rs. 57.61 per kilogramme in 2021,

compared to the previous year. The Government

continued its paddy purchasing programme, as

spearheaded by the Paddy Marketing Board

(PMB), in order to ensure fair prices to farmers.

Accordingly, with effect from March 2021, the PMB

purchased paddy at the price of Rs. 56.50 per

kilogramme for all varieties, which was later revised

3 Household rice demand is computed using the average rice consumption of households based on Household Income and Expenditure Survey – 2016, which provides latest data for the purpose, and mid-year population in 2021.

to Rs. 50.00 per kilogramme for Nadu, Rs. 52.00 per

kilogramme for Samba, and Rs. 55.00 per kilogramme

for Keeri Samba in July 2021. Further, the guaranteed

price for Nadu was further increased to Rs. 55.00 per

kilogramme in September 2021. The PMB purchased

around 44,948 metric tons of paddy stock from the

2020/2021 Maha harvest, while around 7,728 metric

tons were purchased during the 2021 Yala season.

Further, necessary approval was granted in February

2022 to purchase paddy for the 2021/2022 Maha

season at Rs. 90.00 per kilogramme for Nadu,

Rs. 92.00 per kilogramme for Samba, and Rs. 95.00

per kilogramme for Keeri Samba with the view to

providing competitive prices for paddy farmers. The

PMB expects to purchase around 300,000 metric

tons of paddy during the 2021/2022 Maha season,

and as of mid-March 2022, around 70,000 metric

tons had been purchased. However, as the efficiency

of the paddy purchasing programme of the PMB is

constrained due to a host of factors such as the lack

of infrastructure and logistics, including warehouse

facilities, drying, and transportation facilities, private

millers were able to buy significantly higher quantities

of paddy at competitive prices in the open market. On

average, the retail price of Samba was Rs. 136.52

per kilogramme in 2021, which was an increase of

30.8 per cent, compared to the previous year, while

the average retail price of Nadu stood at Rs. 116.56

per kilogramme in 2021 in comparison to Rs. 100.01

per kilogramme reported in the previous year. Due

to high price volatilities and to prevent exploitation

of consumers amidst these developments, a

Gazette was issued on 02 September 2021 setting

a maximum retail price (MRP) for Samba rice at

Rs.103.00 per kilogramme and Nadu rice at

Rs.98.00 per kilogramme. However, this Gazette

was later revoked towards end September 2021

leading to a price escalation thereon. Meanwhile,

the Special Commodity Levy on imported Samba,

Nadu, and Raw rice was reduced, considerably, from

Rs. 65.00 to Rs. 0.25 per kilogramme from October

2021 to June 2022 with the aim of ensuring a sufficient

and continuous supply of rice in the market.

Several measures were undertaken across

the agriculture sector to uplift productivity in

a sustainable manner in line with the National

Policy Framework of the Government. With

due consideration to the negative consequences

of excessive use of agro chemicals, a ban on

the importation of chemical fertilisers, pesticides

and herbicides was imposed in May 2021. In this

regard, several programmes were carried out for

the expeditious adoption of sustainable agriculture

practices, while encouraging local production of

organic fertiliser, which gathered pace gradually.

However, this swift policy move resulted in limited

availability of inorganic and organic fertilisers,

creating concerns of sizeable yield losses in paddy

cultivation and causing escalations in the price of

paddy. Therefore, measures were taken to import

natural organic fertiliser, chelated minerals, and

micronutrients for paddy cultivation. The Government

also planned to import Muriate of Potash for paddy

cultivation during the 2022 Yala season. Another key

initiative to encourage organic agricultural practices

was the provision of an incentive of Rs.12,500 per

hectare, capped at a maximum of one hectare, to

farmers who produce organic fertiliser for their own

paddy cultivation in the 2021/2022 Maha season.

Further, organic and bio fertilisers were provided

as subsidies for the 2021/2022 Maha season in

order to address soil nutrient deficiencies in the

paddy fields, while also assisting farmers to produce

their own compost fertiliser for their usage. In this

regard, laboratory facilities were made available to

ensure the quality of compost fertiliser. Rice variety

screening for organic cultivation was also carried out

encompassing 10 popular varieties and 4 traditional

varieties to select the best performing varieties.

Creating new crosses and evaluating breeding lines

were also carried out under the Crop Improvement

Programme, while the Production and Productivity

Enhancement of Paddy Project was continued

with the aim of implementing a suite of agriculture

technologies spanning the entire cultivation process

starting from land preparation to harvest.

Tea

The production of tea recorded an overall

growth of 7.4 per cent in 2021, driven by a

significant expansion during the first half of the

year, owing mainly to the lower base induced

by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the

corresponding period of 2020. Following the

significant increase of 24.0 per cent recorded in

the first half of the year, a sharp contraction of

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

62

7.2 per cent was registered in tea production

during the latter half of the year, largely driven by

unfavourable weather conditions that prevailed

during the months of November and December.

Production of high, medium, and low grown tea,

which contributes to about 22 per cent, 17 per

cent and 61 per cent of the total production,

respectively, expanded by 5.0 per cent, 9.1 per

cent and 7.8 per cent, respectively, in 2021. In the

meantime, the average yield in the smallholder

sector increased to 1,880 kilogrammes per

hectare, compared to 1,766 kilogrammes per

hectare reported in 2020 and remained above the

average yield of the large plantation sector.

Tea prices at the Colombo Tea Auction

(CTA) remained elevated in 2021 compared to

pre pandemic levels, but were still lower than

those observed in 2020. The average price

of tea decreased by 2.3 per cent to Rs. 619.15

per kilogramme during the year from Rs. 633.85

per kilogramme recorded in 2020. Accordingly,

average tea prices of medium and low grown

tea declined by 1.0 per cent and 3.5 per cent,

year-on-year, respectively, while high grown

tea reported a marginal increase of 0.6 per cent

in 2021. Further, the average price received

by smallholders for green leaves declined to

Rs. 93.67 per kilogramme during the year from

Rs. 94.36 per kilogramme in 2020. Although the

average export price (FOB) of tea increased by

6.2 per cent to Rs. 920.76 per kilogramme

during the year, the FOB price of tea in US dollar

terms declined by 0.9 per cent during 2021. The

dampening of average tea prices during the year

can be partly attributed to the improvement in tea

production as well as the increase in the quantity

supplied to the auction during the year. Further,

sharp increases in freight costs and other input

costs, such as packing materials, adversely

impacted prices during the year.

Several measures were undertaken by the

Government to strengthen the tea industry in

2021. The Five Year Strategic and Action Plan for the

Tea Sector in Sri Lanka (2021-2025) was finalised

and actions were executed as planned during

the year. The transition to an e-Auction system,

which was a major stepping stone for the tea trade

when initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic in

2020, continued to operate successfully and was

upgraded as ‘SmartAuction’ with strengthened

trading and data features in 2021. Under the

replanting, new planting, and infilling subsidy

programme to increase the productivity of tea

lands, the Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB) disbursed

Rs. 79.8 million for 263 hectares across tea growing

regions. The SLTB continued the Model Tea Garden

project for middle scale tea estates, while providing

Rs. 2.3 million for 17 lands and expects to establish

138 tea nurseries, of which 113 nurseries had been

established as at the end of the year. The Cabinet

of Ministers granted approval to utilise Rs. 1 billion

from the Tea Promotion and Marketing Fund of

the SLTB to provide a grant for tea exporters who

are eligible under the Brand Promotion Scheme

for the exporting of Pure Ceylon Tea. A tripartite

agreement worth euros 1 million was signed by the

SLTB to obtain financial and technical assistance

in relation to obtaining a Geographical Indication

(GI) certification for Ceylon Tea, which is expected

to serve to recognise the quality and the unique

characteristics of the product, as attributable to

Sri Lanka. The Tea Small Holdings Development

Authority (TSHDA) continued its efforts in relation

to tea replanting and new planting programmes

and crop rehabilitation subsidy programmes. In

2021, around 849 hectares of tea lands were

replanted and about 678 hectares of new lands

were converted into tea lands, while 3.3 million

tea plants were used for infilling vacancies in

tea lands. After a hiatus of over five years, the

tea replanting subsidy for tea smallholders

2

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE, INCOME AND EMPLOYMENT

63

was increased to Rs. 630,000 per hectare

from Rs. 500,000 per hectare, while the new

planting subsidy was increased to Rs. 500,000

per hectare from Rs. 400,000 per hectare.

The Tea Research Institute (TRI) continued to

execute research and development activities

and service projects in line with its Strategic Plan

(2019-2023), which strives to strengthen the sector

in line with the Sustainable Development Goals,

Five Year Strategic and Action Plan for Tea and

the National Policy Framework of the Government.

Rubber

Rubber production continued to decrease in

2021 due to incessant rains in plantation areas,

during tapping days along with the prevalence of

fungal disease. Accordingly, production declined

by 1.7 per cent to 76.9 million kilogrammes in 2021

from 78.2 million kilogrammes produced in 2020.

Rubber production showed a rising trend during the

first half of 2021, but declined notably thereafter.

This was due to higher number of rainy days which

dampened production in the last quarter of the year,

which is generally considered as the peak yielding

period of rubber plantations. The production

of sheet rubber, which accounts for about 50

per cent of total rubber production, declined by 1.7

per cent, while crepe rubber production recorded

a growth of 7.4 per cent during the period under

review. The production of other categories of

rubber, which accounts for around 32 per cent of

total rubber production, declined by 6.2 per cent

in comparison to the production of the previous

year. In 2021, domestic consumption of rubber

by local industries increased by 19.4 per cent

to 133.9 million kilogrammes with the gradual

recovery of the industry sector. Meanwhile, exports

of raw rubber recorded a marginal decline of 1.7

per cent to 15.5 million kilogrammes in 2021, owing

to low production.

Reflecting the escalation of natural rubber

prices in global markets, rubber prices in the

domestic market also displayed an increasing

trend during 2021. At the Colombo Rubber

Auction, the average price of Ribbed Smoked

Sheet No.1 (RSS1) rubber increased by 31.1 per

cent to Rs. 460.78 per kilogramme, while prices of

latex crepe witnessed a significant increase of 74.4

per cent to Rs. 626.32 per kilogramme in 2021 over

the prices recorded in 2020. Meanwhile, average

auction prices of RSS1 and latex crepe rubber

stood at Rs. 475.00 per kilogramme and Rs. 696.58

per kilogramme, respectively, as at end December

2021. Average FOB price of rubber also increased

from US dollars 1.91 per kilogramme in 2020 to US

dollars 2.72 per kilogramme in 2021. The surge in

international prices during the latter part of the year

was driven by supply shortages in global markets

due to unseasonal and heavy rains that disrupted

tapping operations in rubber producers amidst

growing demand from East Asia.

The strategies that were implemented by

the Rubber Development Department (RDD)

and the Rubber Research Institute (RRI) for the

development of the rubber sector continued in

2021, aiming at improving sectoral productivity

as well as raising the value addition in the

rubber industry. In line with the National

Agricultural Policy, Rs. 60 million was allocated in

Budget 2021 to provide subsidies for local small

and medium scale entrepreneurs to engage in

natural rubber related production and to transform

small rubber lands into profitable commercial units

by encouraging diversification of income streams.

Under the Productivity Improvement Programme

initiated by the RDD in 2020, targeting the small

holding sector, activities related to new planting,

replanting, preparation of abandoned land for

tapping and enhancing productivity of lands were

underway, while subsidies were provided for

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

64

re-cultivation of abandoned lands, and to

purchase rain guards and weeding equipment.

Further, continued efforts were made in relation

to new planting activities in non-traditional rubber

cultivation areas, including Moneragala and

Ampara districts, under the Smallholder Tea and

Rubber Revitalisation (STaRR) Project. As a part

of its research and development activities, the RRI

introduced an environment friendly and economically

viable slow release fertiliser technique to improve

crop performance across 14 estates under the

Pussellawa, Agalawatta, Kelani Valley, and Kegalle

plantations and 6 smallholder sites. The RRI also

conducted 64 on-farm participatory research trials

for compost application, covering a total extent of

131.8 acres in the Kalutara, Kurunegala, Matale,

Kegalle, Matara, Galle, Colombo, and Ratnapura

districts. Moreover, the Ministry of Plantation

established an Inter-institutional Coordinating

Committee for Development of Rubber Cultivation

and Industries, comprising representatives of

relevant ministries and institutions, with the intention

of devising holistic policies to develop and strengthen

the rubber industry and relevant value chains.

Coconut

Coconut production reached a historically

high level with total nut production of 3,120

million nuts in 2021. Accordingly, coconut

production recorded a growth of 11.7 per cent in

2021 compared to the contraction of 9.5 per cent

recorded in 2020. The increase was largely driven

by conducive weather conditions that resulted

in well distributed rainfalls from the latter part of

2020 onwards and throughout 2021, in addition to

favourable air temperature in key coconut growing

areas. As coconut production recovered from its

subdued performance in 2020, the output of major

kernel products showed improvements during the

period under review. Accordingly, the production

of desiccated coconut increased by 31.8 per cent

to 33,289 metric tons, while coconut oil production

improved significantly by 117.8 per cent in 2021,

compared to 2020. The increase in coconut oil

production was a result of the policy initiatives

of the Government to promote local coconut oil

production, while discouraging the importation

and consumption of palm oil and other edible oil

imports. Production of coconut cream, coconut

milk, and coconut milk powder also increased in

2021. Despite the increase in production of total

nuts, copra and fresh nut exports dropped in 2021,

amidst growing industrial demand for processed

products. Meanwhile, steps were taken to import

frozen coconut kernel for coconut based industries,

as local production was insufficient to meet the

growing demand of the industry sector.

Prices of coconut and coconut based

products remained at an elevated level

during 2021 amid the high levels of coconut

production reflecting the demand emerging

from coconut based industries. Accordingly,

the average auction price of coconut at the

Colombo Coconut Auction increased to Rs. 56.51

per nut in 2021 from Rs. 48.89 per nut in 2020.

The average retail price of coconut increased

by 13.7 per cent to Rs. 83.90 per nut over 2020.

Although the Government imposed MRPs for

coconuts, in September 2020 ranging from Rs. 60

to Rs 70, based on circumference, coconuts were

sold above the controlled prices in local markets,

resulting in the revocation of price controls in June

2021. With the notable drop in edible oil imports

and increase in edible oil prices in the global

market, the average domestic price of coconut

oil increased by 29.2 per cent to Rs. 443.42 per

750 ml bottle in 2021. The average local market

price of desiccated coconut also increased further

during the year to Rs. 537.25 per kilogramme

compared to Rs. 447.56 per kilogramme recorded

in the previous year.

The Government took a series of measures

to improve productivity of coconut lands

through initiatives focused on the creation

of a sustainable coconut cultivation system.

Accordingly, the Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB)

introduced a special subsidy scheme in 2021 to

rehabilitate existing coconut lands using organic

manure, soil mulching, and moisture conservation

techniques. Also, the scheme for provision of

coconut seedlings at a subsidised rate for systematic

cultivation continued during the year. Steps were

taken to establish efficient irrigation systems in

coconut lands through a new subsidy system that

supports the construction of micro irrigation systems,

hose irrigation systems, and water sources in

coconut lands. This is expected to help mitigate the

effects of adverse weather on coconut cultivation.

During the year, the Coconut Research Institute

(CRI) also engaged in several activities relating

to the production of genetically superior hybrid

coconut seed nuts and the establishment of a new

coconut seed garden to produce the high yielding

Kapsuwaya hybrid coconut cultivar. The CRI also

engaged in initiatives pertaining to the estimation of

organic fertiliser requirements for coconut cultivation

and the standardisation of solid and liquid organic

fertiliser. The Coconut Development Authority

(CDA) continued to offer support to coconut based

industries by facilitating financial support to coconut

product manufacturers and entrepreneurs, while

ensuring continuous improvement in diversification

and manufacture of value added coconut products.

Minor Export Crops

The growth momentum of minor export

crops continued in 2021, despite COVID-19

related global supply chain interruptions.

According to the provisional estimates of the

Department of Export Agriculture (DEA), the

production of minor export crops increased by

28.6 per cent in 2021 over 2020. Restrictions

imposed by the Government on the importation of

spices encouraged farmers to actively engage in

cultivation, resulting in improved performance of

the sector. The production of cinnamon, pepper,

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

66

clove, cardamom, coffee, cocoa, and nutmeg

registered growths in 2021, while the production of

betel declined marginally in 2021. Further, prices

for pepper increased significantly following the rise

in global demand for the crop, thereby providing

financial relief to cultivators who had been suffering

from low prices since 2016. With the initiation of

the Accelerated Turmeric Cultivation Development

Programme by the Government, turmeric cultivation

expanded significantly during 2021 in line with the

Government’s goals of achieving self-sufficiency

in the crop. Reflecting improved production, the

export agriculture crop sector recorded its highest

performance in 2021 with total export volume of

the sector registering an increase of 20.4 per cent,

while export earnings increased by 41.0 per cent,

in rupee terms, during the year.

Several measures targeted at generating

foreign earnings by enhancing the quality and

productivity of export agricultural crops were

adopted to uplift the performance of the export

agriculture sector. Research and development

activities relating to the expansion of cultivation

of pepper, arecanut, ginger, turmeric, and betel

in non-traditional areas such as Anuradhapura,

Polonnaruwa, Ampara, Vavuniya and Jaffna

continued in 2021. The DEA continued to implement

initiatives to enhance the quality of production,

including the introduction and popularisation of

organic cultivation, Good Agricultural Practices

(GAP), and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).

Further, a number of development programmes,

such as productivity improvement programmes,

crop specific development programmes, and

organic cultivation promotion programmes, were

conducted in 2021 to assist in the establishment of

economically productive cultivations. Technology

related guidance and support were provided to

farmers with the aim of enhancing post harvest

practices and to induct them into value adding

activities using appropriate technologies.

Cultivators were also provided with assistance

to obtain quality certifications, and organic

certifications through the organic cultivation

promotion programme.

Other Field Crops

The production of Other Field Crops (OFCs)

increased due to favourable weather conditions

and rising demand for domestic produce, amidst

bans on imports of these crops. Accordingly, in

2021, the overall production of OFCs increased

by 27.3 per cent, year-on-year, to 843,297 metric

tons, of which a significant portion was driven by

the growth of 41.9 per cent registered during the

2020/2021 Maha season. The 2021 Yala season

recorded an increase of 2.0 per cent over the

previous Yala season. Domestic production of OFCs

such as maize, finger millet (kurakkan), potato, big

onion, green gram, black gram, ground nut and

gingelly recorded an increase, while the production

of red onion, green chillies, cowpea, soya bean

and sorghum recorded a decline. Maize production

registered a significant increase of 50.7 per cent

to 472,444 metric tons during the year compared

to 2020, as a result of several strengthening

programmes conducted by the Government in

order to improve domestic maize production. Also,

importation of maize decreased by 47.8 per cent in

2021, due to measures undertaken to curb maize

importation. Potato production, which declined by

36.0 per cent in 2020, rebounded with a growth of

16.6 per cent in 2021, while potato imports dropped

by 8.0 per cent over 2020. Further, big onion

production increased by 53.2 per cent to 65,907

metric tons compared to the previous year and

importation of big onions decreased by 3.2 per cent

to 257,421 metric tons in 2021. In the meantime,

the Government adopted several measures to

enhance domestic production of OFCs via specific

2

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE, INCOME AND EMPLOYMENT

67

production improvement initiatives, on top of the

continuous support offered through the distribution

of seeds and planting materials. Accordingly, during

the year, the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) continued

the construction of 102 island wide warehouses for

OFCs, of which 76 projects had been completed

as at end of 2021, with the aim of providing short-

term storage facilities to farmers under the national

programme to pave the way for improved food

security, while also ensuring a fair price for crops.

The Department of Agriculture (DoA) continued

its efforts to promote GAPs, expand the extent of

cultivation of OFCs, improve pest management

techniques, and increase the usage of high yielding

seeds, while focusing on improvements to water

management. In order to strengthen domestic food

security, further efforts are required to improve

the supply of all OFCs by way of promoting seed

production, optimal usage of agricultural inputs

such as fertiliser and pesticides, expanding storage

capacity, adopting best practices on climate resilient

agriculture, increasing integration into value chains

and establishing new marketing platforms.

Vegetables

The supply of vegetables declined in 2021

owing to the combined impact of inclement

weather, the fertiliser shortage, and increased

machinery and transportation costs. The total

production of vegetables decreased by 1.4 per cent

to 1,669,515 metric tons in 2021, in comparison

to 1,693,095 metric tons recorded in 2020. This

decline was mainly due to the lower production of

vegetables during the 2020/2021 Maha season

during which a contraction of 2.5 per cent to 871,729

metric tons was observed over the previous Maha

season. Meanwhile, the 2021 Yala production also

marginally declined by 0.2 per cent to 797,786

metric tons, compared to the corresponding season

of 2020. The low production and disruptions in the

supply chain resulted in the volatility of vegetable

prices throughout the year. Accordingly, vegetable

prices remained elevated during the year except

for slight declines seen in the months of March

and September due to the seasonal harvest.

Towards the end of the year, vegetable prices

increased sharply, surpassing the seasonal price

patterns, owing to the crop damages and supply

chain disruptions caused by heavy rains, fertiliser

shortage, and spread of pests and diseases due

to the shortage of agro chemicals. Meanwhile,

21,540 metric tons of vegetables worth US dollars

28.5 million were exported, while 697,144 metric

tons of vegetables worth US dollars 384.3 million

were imported during 2021. Moreover, several

government authorities continued to undertake

measures to promote and strengthen domestic

vegetable production during the year. The

National Institute of Post-Harvest Management

functioning under the MoA carried out several

research and development projects, training and

awareness programmes, and consultancy services

to improve the adoption of technology, while

assessing the impact of such technology-centric

techniques on post-harvest management and their

spillover effects on strengthening agribusiness

development and improving food security. In early

2022, the Government initiated a national level

programme for home gardening with the support

of eight government agencies in order to increase

vegetable and fruit production, and ensure food

security.

Fruits

According to the provisional estimates of the

Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), the

production of fruits was estimated at 3.3 million

metric tons in 2021. During the year under review,

43,426 metric tons of fruits, worth US dollars 38.0

million were exported, while 55,725 metric tons

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

68

of fruits, valued at US dollars 67.6 million were

imported. The top three fruit exports comprised

bananas, papaws and pineapples, while the top

three fruit imports comprised apples, grapes and

oranges. Despite the robust demand for local

fruits, local producers possess limited capacity to

cater to domestic demand. Accordingly, several

measures were implemented by the MoA and DoA

to enhance productivity, storage and distribution

facilities and optimal usage of agricultural inputs,

while ensuring the reduction of post-harvest

losses. In June 2021, the MoA implemented a

programme for District Secretaries or Government

Agents to purchase stocks of vegetables and fruits

that could not be conveniently sold, due to the

imposition of mobility restrictions. Vegetables and

fruits were to be purchased at prices determined

by the respective District Price Committee thereby

ensuring that farmers receive a fair price for their

production. In March 2022, the Government took

steps to limit the importation of several fruits,

including oranges, mandarins, grapes, and apples

as part of its measures to curb high expenditure on

non-essential imports.

Sugar

Sugar production continued its upward

trend in 2021 supported by favourable rainfall

patterns and expanded cultivation extent. The

total volume of sugar produced at the Sevanagala,

Pelwatte, and Gal Oya sugar factories recorded

a further increase of 17.9 per cent to 70,606

metric tons in 2021, over the growth of 14.5 per

cent recorded in 2020. Accordingly, during the

period under review, the production across the

Sevanagala, Pelwatte, and Gal Oya sugar factories

grew by 10.4 per cent, 28.8 per cent, and 11.2 per

cent, respectively. The total extent under sugarcane

cultivation (including ratoons) managed by the

factories also increased by 3.5 per cent during the

year. Further, the Ethimale Plantations, which has

commenced production activities is expected to

make significant contributions to domestic sugar

production in the near future. Meanwhile, re-

establishment activities pertaining to the Kantale

sugar factory and the sugarcane plantation were

in progress, albeit at a modest pace due to legal

issues. Although total sugar production and average

yield increased in 2021, sugar productivity, as

measured by the sugar recovery rate,4 decreased

in 2021. These may be attributed to poor irrigation

management, particularly during harvesting time,

and inefficiencies in the quality based cane pricing

system along with improper sampling systems in

sugar factories.

Several strategies were implemented in

the sugar industry, focused on productivity

improvements in existing plantations and

expansion of cultivation. Considering the

high level of sugar imports over low domestic

production, efforts to expand sugarcane plantations

through provision of seed cane, establishment of

multiplication plots and nurseries in various cane

growing areas, and crop improvement and resource

management practices continued throughout the

year. In compliance with the Government's policy

guidelines, several development programmes

related to the shift away from inorganic farming

practices and towards organic farming practices

were in progress during the year. These included

the introduction of organic fertiliser and biochemical

and bio-control measures, and the formulation of

a site-specific fertiliser recommendation model

for sugarcane-growing soils. Meanwhile, the

Sugarcane Research Institute (SRI) continued to

undertake initiatives related to the setting up of new

sugarcane factories in Weli Oya, Horowpathana

and Bibile, while expanding sugarcane cultivation

in the Skandhapuram area in Kilinochchi. The SRI

actively engaged in the process of updating the

National Sugar Sector Development Policy, which

was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in 2016,

to better reflect the current global and domestic

situation. In light of the sharp rise in global sugar

prices and the substantial foreign exchange spent

on sugar imports, it is vital that the Government

collaborates with these institutions to undertake

a timely restructuring of the sugar industry,

while exploring the potential for expansion of

production capacity through the use of improved

varieties, better agronomic practices and modern

technologies.

Livestock

The performance of the livestock sector

showed signs of improvement during 2021.

According to the estimates of the DCS, the total

national milk production grew by 4.4 per cent

to 513 million litres in 2021. The growth in milk

production was mainly driven by an increase in

the average producer price of cow milk, increased

milk collection, and the addition of new dairy

farms. The average cost of production of cow

milk increased to Rs. 69.30 per litre in 2021 from

Rs. 49.28 per litre recorded in the preceding year

owing to the increased price of concentrate feed

and high labour charges. However, due to the

increased demand for liquid milk stemming from

shortages of imported and domestic milk powder

and the significant increases in milk powder

prices, the price received by farmers for locally

produced liquid milk was also relatively high

during the year. Accordingly, the average farm

gate price of a litre of cow milk increased from

Rs. 82.00 in 2020 to Rs. 98.00 in 2021. As per

the Department of Animal Production and Health

(DAPH), the contribution of local milk production

to meeting the country's total requirement stood

at around 38 per cent in 2021. In the poultry

sector, egg production witnessed a growth of

4.5 per cent in 2021 compared to the previous year.

However, the lack of feed ingredients and rising

feed costs translated into reductions in the size

and the number of eggs produced per bird. Further,

poultry meat production increased by 9.5 per cent,

while the cost of production of chicken increased

from Rs. 342.07 per kilogramme to Rs. 434.19 per

kilogramme in 2021. The local production of

broiler parents broadly remained unchanged,

while importation of broiler parents increased,

resulting in a higher availability of broiler parent

day-old chicks in 2021. During the period under

review, the production of beef, pork and mutton

increased by 4.4 per cent, 4.9 per cent and 1.0 per

cent, respectively.

The Government continued to promote the

livestock sector by implementing necessary

measures and providing policy support during

the year. Under the Livestock Breeding Project of

the DAPH, around 196,364 artificial inseminations

were carried out on cattle and buffalos during 2021

through divisional veterinary offices. Provision

of cattle feed to improve the nutrition of female

calves born through artificial insemination and

vaccination against various animal diseases were

also in progress during the period under review.

Further, under the Comprehensive Mastitis Control

Programme, udder infusions were produced

locally and issued to the dairy farmers to control

and prevent clinical and subclinical mastitis in

the national herd. Despite several initiatives to

improve the dairy industry, the local dairy industry

largely comprises small scale dairy producers,

with average production levels ranging from 2-3

litres per day. Poor feeding practices along with

the reduction in locally produced feed ingredients,

higher calving intervals and breeding issues,

inadequate infrastructure for milk storage, cooling,

transportation and processing, and poor health

status of cows continued to contribute to low

productivity. Considering the country's urgent need

for dairy sector development, upgrading the dairy

industry to medium and large-scale farms, as well

as ensuring the availability of high quality feed at

affordable prices, establishing a cost reflective

price mechanism for milk and milk products, and

increasing the productivity of existing herds could

greatly facilitate fulfillment of the domestic demand

for milk and milk products. On the other hand,

domestic maize production, which is largely used

as the primary ingredient in domestic poultry feed

production, is still insufficient to fulfill total demand,

there by creating difficulties in obtaining required

feed and forcing feed producers to turn to high cost

substitutes and resulting in feed price fluctuations

and a significant drop in feed production.

Accordingly, small scale poultry producers have

become more vulnerable to market pressures.

Therefore, encouraging domestic maize cultivation

and introducing technology to increase productivity

remain critical in ensuring the long term viability

of the poultry sector, while also ensuring that

temporary supply shortages are addressed in a

timely manner.

Fisheries

The production of the fisheries sector

remained subdued in 2021 following the steep

contraction observed in 2020. Accordingly,

marine fish production, which comprises coastal

and off shore sub sectors and accounts for around

76 per cent of the total fish production, increased by

1.5 per cent. Inland fishery production increased by

2.4 per cent mainly driven by the increase in shrimp

farm production coupled with improved aquaculture

practices. Meanwhile, during the second and third

quarters of 2021, fish production was affected by

the disruptions to marine fishing activities due to the

Xpress Pearl vessel incident that caused significant

damage to coastal and marine resources. The

authorities took immediate measures to impose a

temporary fishing ban in the affected areas from

Kalutara to Negombo to ensure the safety of the

fishing community and the consumers. Subsequently,

the Government disbursed an allowance of

Rs. 5,000 per affected family, while offering

replacements for damaged fishing gear so as to

safeguard the livelihoods of fishing communities.

However, fish production and consumption

witnessed a rebound in the fourth quarter of

2021. The retail price of fish varieties fluctuated

throughout the year as a result of disruptions to

fishing activities and increased logistics costs.

According to the Ministry of Fisheries (MoF), fish

exports increased by 25.6 per cent in volume

terms and by 58.6 per cent in rupee terms in 2021,

reflecting the impact of the measures taken by the

authorities to provide necessary guidance and

assistance to stakeholders in order to export high

quality fish products in accordance with relevant

regulations imposed by the importer countries. Fish

imports declined notably by 34.5 per cent during

the period under review.

The Government continued to undertake its

efforts aimed at increasing the contribution of

the fisheries sector to the national economy.

The MoF undertook several initiatives to enhance

fish production, while focusing on the reduction in

post harvest losses, which accounts for around 20-30

71

per cent of total production. Several initiatives were

also underway to prevent illegal, unreported, and

unregulated fishing activities. Construction activities

of new harbours, upgrading of existing harbours,

and construction of anchorages and landing sites

were in progress during the year to enable large

scale multiday fishing vessels to dock. Initiatives to

improve modern cooling, storage and transportation

facilities, which are essential logistics for improved

fish production were also underway during 2021. The

MoF, in collaboration with the National Aquaculture

Development Authority (NAQDA), implemented

a number of non-traditional farming initiatives to

enhance inland fish and aquaculture production,

improve exports and strengthen the rural economy.

In this regard, the establishment of community based

fish breeding units, the improvement of small scale

fish seed production units for post larvae rearing, and

the rehabilitation and improvement of aquaculture

development centers in order to increase fish

fingerling production were in progress during the year.

Initiatives to intensify shrimp culture were continued

through various measures such as the installation

of a water recirculation system, the improvement of

biosecurity in farming areas, and the dredging of the

Dutch Canal in Puttalam to access quality water. In

addition to shrimp farming, the NAQDA also engaged

in the promotion of commercial aquaculture through

the development of sea weed, sea bass, crab, sea

cucumber, and milk fish farming. Sea weed farming

activities in the Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar, and

Puttalam sea areas and the construction of a milk fish

hatchery in Puttalam were underway during the year.

A sea cucumber hatchery in Mannar commenced

operations in March 2021 and a sea cucumber village

was established in Kilinochchi, while steps were taken

to expand sea cucumber farming in Jaffna with a view

to increasing sea cucumber exports. Furthermore,

the development of new ornamental fish strains, the

advancement of aquaculture technology, and the

provision of brood fish and fish disease diagnosis

activities were also underway in order to support the

development of ornamental fish and aquatic plant

culture and export sector.

Industry

Benefiting from the pent-up demand and

the continuation of the operations under the

'new normal', Industry value-added recovered

by 5.3 per cent in 2021, from the contraction of

6.9 per cent registered in 2020, yet the figures

masked the lingering damage caused by supply-

side impediments. The recovery in manufacturing

activities led the Industry growth while construction

and, mining and quarrying activities recorded

moderate expansions. Meanwhile, electricity, gas,

steam, and air conditioning supply activities, and

water collection, treatment and supply activities also

expanded during the year, positively contributing

to overall Industry activities. However, sewerage,

waste treatment, and disposal activities contracted

in 2021. Reflecting the recovery in Industry activities,

the Demand and Production sub-indices related

to the Industry activities of the Business Outlook

Survey (BOS) conducted by the Central Bank on a

quarterly basis, indicated an expansion on average

during the year.

Manufacturing

Continuing the operations under new

normalcy, the value-added of manufacturing

activities turned to a recovery path with a

growth of 7.2 per cent in 2021, from the decline

of 3.9 per cent recorded in 2020. The successful

vaccination rollout in the country, relaxation of the

pandemic-related mobility restrictions, allowing of

continuous functioning of factory operations and

the adjustment of the economic environment to

'new normal' provided an impetus to the recovery in

manufacturing activities during the year. Accordingly,

all manufacturing activities expanded during the

year, except the manufacture of coke and refined

petroleum products which was adversely affected

by the temporary closure of the Sapugaskanda

refinery. Manufacture of textiles, wearing apparel

and leather-related products was a key contributor

to the overall growth of manufacturing activities,

largely supported by the healthy external demand.

Further, the manufacture of food, beverages, and

tobacco products, rubber and plastic products, and

other non-metallic mineral products also contributed

considerably to the expansion in manufacturing

activities. Considering the manufacturing-related

indicators, the Index of Industrial Production (IIP)

compiled by the DCS recorded an increase in

2021, indicating the recovery in manufacturing

activities. Further, the Purchasing Managers’ Index

(PMI) for manufacturing activities, compiled by the

Central Bank on a monthly basis, also indicated an

expansion of manufacturing activities on average

during the year. However, the delays in the supply

chain hindered the sector from reaching its full

potential.

Index of Industrial Production

Following a notable setback in 2020, the

manufacturing sector showed a rebound in 2021

despite the challenges brought about by the

COVID-19 pandemic. As per the Index of Industrial

Production (IIP) compiled by the DCS, with increased

production across majority of the sub sectors, the

manufacturing sector witnessed a significant growth

of 7.3 per cent in 2021 compared to the decline of

10.2 per cent observed in 2020. The highest value

of the IIP of 119.6 since its inception was reported

in March 2021. Imposition of selective and less

rigid mobility restrictions during the outbreaks of

COVID-19 in 2021 allowed major industrial activities

to continue without much disruption. The COVID-19

vaccination drive that picked up pace, especially

during the second half of the year also facilitated

the continuation of industrial activity. The positive

performance of the IIP was primarily driven by the

subsectors of manufacturing of wearing apparel,

non-metallic mineral products, rubber and plastic

products, textiles, basic metals and beverages.

However, the overall positive momentum of the IIP

was weighed down by the manufacturing of coke and

refined petroleum products subsector, on account of

occasional closures of the refinery.

Although food manufacturing activities

remained subdued during the year, beverage

manufacturing activities recorded a sizeable

growth. The modest pace of growth observed in

the largest sub-sector in the IIP, the manufacture of

food products, was largely a result of disruptions to

both domestic and global supply chains. Subsequent

to a marginal contraction of 0.8 per cent registered

during the first half of the year, the sub-sector showed

improved performance during the latter half leading

to a marginal expansion of 0.2 per cent during the

year, with increased production of chicken products,

canned fish, jam, sauce and biscuits. Beverage

manufacturing activities recorded a significant growth

of 9.8 per cent in 2021 compared to the contraction

of 6.7 per cent recorded in 2020. Improved demand

for beverages was seen in line with the restoration

of normalcy in the economy as restrictions on events

and social activities were also lifted to a great extent.

The manufacturing of wearing apparel and

textiles subsectors made strong headway

during 2021 supported by the improvements

in global supply chains, the policy decisions of

the Government to facilitate the continuation of

manufacturing activities amid pandemic related

mobility restrictions and the low base reported in

2020. The manufacture of the wearing apparel sub

sector, which accounts for around one-fifth of the

IIP, registered a significant growth of 17.5 per cent in

2021 in comparison to the sharp contraction of 30.7

per cent in the previous year. The manufacturing

of textile products also followed suit, reporting

a significant expansion of 25.9 per cent in 2021

followed by a contraction of 5.6 per cent in 2020.

The positive performances of these sub-sectors were

driven by the overall rebound in the global economy,

especially in key export destinations that enabled a

steady recovery of export demand. The abating of

disruptions to domestic and global supply chains,

which had weighed negatively on the availability of

raw materials also facilitated the growth momentum

of the sector. Meanwhile, the rapid deployment of

vaccines to workers engaged in this sector alongside

the Government’s decision to allow the continuation

of manufacturing activities amidst COVID-19 related

mobility restrictions helped minimise disruptions,

enabling the sectoral performance of manufacture of

wearing apparel and textile products to rebound.

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

74

The subsectors of manufacture of other

nonmetallic mineral products, basic metals,

and fabricated metal products registered

significant expansions of 23.0, 20.7 and 23.5

per cent respectively, in 2021 subsequent to

the COVID-19 induced contractions in 2020.

The positive performance of these subsectors

was driven by the initiatives of the Government to

improve the domestic production capacity, while

imposing import restrictions on tiles and ceramic

products. The rebound observed in the construction

sector during the year also contributed to the

improvement in demand for products from these

subsectors. Increases in the production of cement,

tiles, glass bottles, roofing sheets and porcelain

tableware were key contributors to the expansion in

production in the manufacture of other nonmetallic

mineral products subsector. In particular, the overall

expansions in the manufacture of basic metals

and the manufacture of fabricated metal products

subsectors were primarily driven by the increased

production in lead and aluminum, aluminum bars,

and steel and aluminum products.

Production of coke and refined petroleum

products witnessed a sharp decline during the

year, on top of the contraction reported in 2020,

owing to the disruptions in the operations of

the refinery of the Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation (CPC). The manufacture of coke and

refined petroleum products subsector witnessed a

contraction of 26.8 per cent during 2021 compared

to the contraction of 9.0 per cent during the

previous year. During the first half of 2021, the

refinery was shut down for almost two months for

maintenance purposes followed by a temporary

closure of almost a month during the fourth quarter

of 2021 due to lack of crude oil imports on account

of foreign exchange issues and escalating crude oil

prices that hampered timely procurement. In turn, a

decline in the production of petrol, auto diesel, and

furnace oil was observed during the year.

during the COVID-19 pandemic led to the

manufacturing of basic pharmaceutical

products and pharmaceutical preparations

subsector to continue its growth momentum

in 2021. Accordingly, the subsector registered an

expansion of 12.6 per cent during 2021, continuing

the expansion of 6.6 per cent registered in 2020.

The increase in the demand for Ayurvedic products,

predominantly driven by the pandemic, led to the

continuation of the upward growth momentum of

the subsector.

The manufacturing of rubber and plastic

products subsector recorded a significant

expansion during 2021. The COVID-19 induced

demand for medical rubber gloves alongside

significant improvements to the domestic

production capacity of tyres resulted in the

subsector registering a growth of 35.7 per cent.

The growth of the subsector was also driven by

the increased production of zippers, plastic bottles,

and elastomeric yarn, among others. In 2021,

production of tobacco products, which contracted

for three consecutive years, registered a growth

of 8.0 per cent in comparison to the contraction of

11.0 per cent witnessed in 2020.

The manufacture of leather and related

products subsector and the chemicals and

chemical products subsector also depicted

subdued performance. The manufacture of

leather and related products subsector recorded

a marginal expansion of 1.3 per cent in 2021,

while the manufacture of chemicals and chemical

products subsector registered an overall contraction

of 4.7 per cent. Key drivers of the decline of the

latter were the reduced production of chemical

fertilisers. However, both sectors showed signs of

improvement towards the end of the year with the

improvement in domestic demand conditions.

Other sub sectors of IIP, such as the

manufacture of wood products (except

furniture), electrical equipment, furniture, paper

and paper products, machinery and equipment,

and printing and reproduction of recorded

media registered expansions during 2021.

Increased production of corrugated papers, paper

bags, and exercise book production contributed

to the expansion in paper and paper products

subsector, while physical school reopening and

the resultant rebound in educational activities

resulted in the increased production of printed

books, which led to the positive performance of

the printing and reproduction of recorded media

subsector. The increase in production of several

household appliances, in line with growing demand

for domestic products, amid import restrictions, led

to the expansion of the manufacture of electrical

equipment sub sector.

Industrial Policies and Institutional Support

During the year, the Government continued

to undertake several initiatives aimed at

strengthening the industrial sector to enhance

of the drafting of the National Policy for Industrial

Development (NaPID) marked a key milestone in

2021. The drafting of the NaPID was preceded by

an industry diagnosis report that served to provide a

comprehensive and indepth analysis, diagnosing the

factors that were hindering the progress of industrial

development. The NaPID strives to establish a

globally competitive industry for sustainable

and inclusive growth, while also focusing on the

advancement of green growth and digitalisation.

Meanwhile, initiatives were underway to establish

an industrial zone in Katunayake Kaludiyawela

and to expand the Kalutara industrial estate under

the Regional Industrial Estates Development

Programme. In line with the Government’s target

to expand the scope of mineral-based industries,

preliminary work was underway to commence

a Value Addition Project for Mineral Sands

excavated by Lanka Mineral Sands Limited, as a

Public Private Partnership (PPP). Meanwhile, the

Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) guidelines

for the automobile manufacturing, assembling,

and manufacturing of spare parts industry were

implemented during the year. At end 2021, 13

manufacturing companies were registered under

the SOP, while 2,361 vehicles were assembled.

Moreover, the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers

was granted to setup 5 techno parks in Galle,

Kurunegala, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, and Habarana

areas under the purview of the Ministry of Technology

with the aim of attracting foreign investments in the

form of new ventures with advanced technology,

which may improve the export base of the country

as well as create knowledge spillovers. During the

year, the MoF also initiated the establishment of a

virtual platform for Small and Medium Enterprises

(SMEs) with the support of the Asian Development

Bank (ADB) targeting the enhancement of technical

capacity of women entrepreneurs. With the view

of improving and sustaining a national innovation

ecosystem, the National Innovation Agency (NIA)

was established under the State Ministry of Skills

Development, Vocational Education, Research and

Innovation in November 2021. The NIA is expected

to facilitate collaborations between industry,

academia, and the Government to harness and

enable commercialisation of innovations across all

sectors in the economy. The State Ministry of Skills

Development, Vocational Education, Research and

Innovation undertook various measures to catering

the educational needs of the industrial sector.

During the year, the Nipunatha Sisu Saviya bursary

scheme was implemented to provide a monthly

stipend of Rs. 4,000 to vocational trainees of low

income families. Moreover, several infrastructure

development projects were in progress to modernise

technical colleges and improve vocational training

centers under the Tech Udana Programme.

The Board of Investment (BOI) and the

Export Development Board (EDB) engaged in

various development initiatives to facilitate

foreign and local investment for domestic

manufacturing industries. During the year, a

modern pharmaceutical manufacturing zone was

established in Arabokka, Hambantota aimed at

strengthening Sri Lanka’s pharmaceutical industry

to cater to both the domestic and international

market. Accordingly, this project is to be developed

in 2 phases, each of which will accommodate 20

companies in each stage. A textile manufacturing

zone was also established during the year, in

Eravur, to reduce material lead time and input

costs with the availability of locally sourced fabric.

The fabric park has already attracted investments

amounting to US dollars 35 million. Moreover, the

approval of the Cabinet of Ministers was granted

to develop a large scale tyre manufacturing plant

at the Hambantota International Port as a strategic

development project. The project is expected to

entail the use of local rubber resources for tyre

manufacturing and subsequent exporting. During

the year, the EDB completed the development of

the regulatory framework for the conduct of the

boat building industry. Further, export advisory

committees were appointed under the EDB Act

No. 40 of 1979 covering 24 key export sectors for

a period of five years. The advisory committees

are expected to create collaborations between

the public and private sector to identify market

challenges and opportunities, while undertaking

initiatives to strengthen competitiveness and outline

required policies. Moreover, in collaboration with

the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission

(TVEC), the EDB prepared a vocational education

training plan to identify the skill gaps and training

requirements of the Electrical and Electronics

industry in Sri Lanka. Further, the EDB coordinated

a series of webinars, buyer linkup gatherings,

and training programmes to encourage and build

the capacity of export oriented SMEs and that of

women entrepreneurs. The EDB also continued to

extend its support to export businesses affected by

the COVID-19 pandemic, through the development

of sectoral revival programmes, formalised help

desk, exporter forums, and e-marketplace to

facilitate potential trade activities.

The National Gem and Jewellery Authority

(NGJA) undertook various steps to enable

Sri Lanka to position itself as a leading gem

center in the region. Accordingly, during the

year, discussions were held with Madagascar,

Tanzania, and Nepal to import rough gems into

Sri Lanka for value addition. The NGJA also

successfully implemented a One-Stop-Shop to

simplify the process of obtaining various licenses

and approvals for unutilised underground gem

resources. It also undertook measures to ease

gem mining restrictions and associated charges to

promote the sale of gems and jewellery. Further,

a 14 per cent tax imposed on the profits earned

by gem and jewellery industrialists were waived

off in April 2021 to encourage manufacturing,

while increasing the value threshold of gems that

could be sold through virtual platforms. Moreover,

construction work related to the international gem

tower in Ratnapura was underway during the year.

Other government authorities continued

to provide institutional support to industrial

sector and policy formulation. The National

Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA)

continued its endeavours to popularise the Made in

Sri Lanka logo through several trade fairs in 2021.

During the year, 37 SMEs were authorised to use

the logo in recognition of their products entailing

high value additions and with the view to promote

and uplift such products to be marketed at a global

level. Further, the Made in Sri Lanka Business to

Business (B2B) online trade portal was launched

in December 2021 to expand the marketing

opportunities available to SMEs. By the end of the

year, 346 sellers had registered with this portal.

The Regional Entrepreneurship Development

Programme and the Upadidari Vyavasayaka

Udanaya Programme were continued in 2021,

promoting entrepreneurships and forming pathways

for university graduates to develop as successful

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

78

entrepreneurs. Accordingly, 5,179 regional level

entrepreneurs were trained, and 71 university

graduates were provided with grants through these

programmes. In the meanwhile, the Industrial

Development Board (IDB) established a Smart One

Stop facilitation center for the Hambantota area

to facilitate initiatives in the area, while promoting

industrial development in the Southern province.

During the year, the IDB also commenced the

Dayata Punarudayak - Karmanthayata Jeewayak

Programme to empower and support small

scale entrepreneurs. The National Productivity

Secretariat (NPS) continued to conduct district level

and institutional level productivity improvement

programmes aimed at creating a people-centric

economy through the empowerment of SMEs.

Several institutions continued to facilitate

technology driven initiatives with the aim

of elevating technological innovation which

has been identified as essential to a dynamic

industrial sector. Accordingly, the National Institute

of Fundamental Studies initiated the preparation of a

technology transfer policy to facilitate the application

of technology and research in the industrial sector.

Moreover, during the year, virtual training and

education sessions pertaining to patent awareness,

technology transfer and commercialisation were

organised by the Coordinating Secretariat for

Science, Technology and Innovation (COSTI) in

collaboration with the World Intellectual Property

Organisation. Further, the National Engineering

Research and Development Center of Sri Lanka

together with the State Ministry of Rattan, Brass,

Pottery, Furniture and Rural Industrial Promotion

conducted several virtual technology dissemination

seminars to facilitate development of SMEs amid

the pandemic. Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Institute of

Nanotechnology (SLINTEC) continued its

technology transfer and commercialisation

initiatives pertaining to emerging fields of studies,

including value addition to local graphite, post-

harvest technology, nano-fertiliser, and novel

healthcare innovations against COVID-19. The

National Science Foundation (NSF) facilitated

the development of the domestic manufacturing

sector through the provision of 11 new research

and development grants to multiple sectors

including health, agriculture, engineering,

and education. During the year, the Industrial

Technology Institute (ITI) commenced testing

services pertaining to several novel laboratories

including pharmaceutical laboratory, lubricant and

petroleum oil testing laboratory, and packaging

testing laboratory. The ITI also entered into 10

Memorandum of Understandings (MoUs) during

the period with various ministries, industries,

international universities, and other authorities to

establish technological partnerships and facilitate

collaborative academic and research activities.

The Industrial Chambers continued to

provide training and promotional assistance

to enhance the competitiveness of Sri Lankan

industries. During the year, the National

Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (NCCSL)

conducted several training and knowledge sharing

programmes aimed at facilitating importers and

exporters to overcome contemporary issues and

challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic,

while business development programmes were also

conducted at international levels including virtual

B2B sessions and business forums to create

trading opportunities for Sri Lankan exporters.

Further, the NCCSL entered into several MoUs with

regional and international institutions during 2021,

thereby establishing networks with counterpart

organisations. The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce

(CCC), in collaboration with an international

partner, implemented the Exporter Barometer

Survey in late 2021. The survey is to be conducted

bi-annually to obtain exporter insights. Further,

2

facilitating trade and business promotion, the CCC

conducted a series of international webinars, B2B

sessions, and meetings with both local and foreign

diplomats. Moreover, with a view to enhancing

institutional cooperation across industrial sectors,

the CCC entered into MoUs with 6 international

level chambers during the year. Meanwhile, the Sri

Lanka Chamber of Small and Medium Industries

conducted capacity building and motivational

programmes to support the SME sector.

Several loan schemes were introduced

in line with the National Policy Framework

to ensure that SMEs were provided with the

necessary financial support in 2021. The Kiri

Shakthi loan scheme was implemented during the

year providing loans amounting up to Rs. 1 million

each at a concessionary interest rate of 7.5 per

cent per annum, with the target of strengthening of

small and medium size dairy farmers. Accordingly,

739 loans were granted under this credit scheme,

thereby leading to the disbursement of Rs. 400.4

million in 2021. Further, as per the decision of the

Cabinet of Ministers to provide financial support to

the manufacturers of organic fertiliser, pesticides

and herbicides, a special loan scheme was

introduced. Meanwhile, guidelines and instructions

were issued by the Central Bank to financial

institutions on implementing debt moratorium and

working capital loan facilities to revive SMEs, self-

employed, and individuals affected by the COVID-19

pandemic. During the year, the MOF also expedited

the establishment of the National Credit Guarantee

Scheme to strengthen the SME sector. Moreover,

the Rooftop Solar Power Generation Line of Credit

and the Small and Medium Enterprise Line of

Credit schemes were continued with the financial

support of a donor agency. By the end of 2021,

Rs. 23.4 billion had been granted under these two

credit schemes.

Construction, and Mining and Quarrying

Bolstered by the renewed demand for real

estate and housing, and the resumption of

projects, construction value-added picked up

by 1.9 per cent in 2021, recovering from the

contraction of 13.2 per cent recorded in 2020,

yet the raw material shortage hindered the

full recovery. Considering construction-related

indicators, total cement availability in the country

recorded a marginal decline, while building

material imports recorded an increase during

2021. Meanwhile, credit to the private sector

granted by Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) for

construction activities, including personal housing

construction activities, also recorded a growth as

of end December 2021, denoting an increased

availability of funds for construction activities.

However, the third wave of the pandemic, which

spanned during the second and third quarters of

the year and disruptions to global and local supply

chains affected adversely to the construction-

related activities. The business surveys related to

construction activities conducted by the Central

Bank indicated that supply-side disturbances,

especially the short supply of key raw materials

such as cement, steel and tiles, as well as the

rapid price increases hindered the full potential

of the industry. Meanwhile, mining and quarrying

activities which mainly consist of mining activities

that provide inputs to the construction activities

such as sand mining, recorded a growth of 2.8 per

cent in 2021, largely benefitting from the recovery

in construction activities, compared to 12.5 per

cent contraction recorded in 2020. With regard

to the other mining-related indicators, phosphate

production recorded an increase in 2021, indicating

a favourable performance in mining activities.

Considering the gem mining related indicators,

gem export volumes recorded an increase in 2021.

Electricity, Water and Waste Treatment

Mainly driven by electricity and gas

supply-related activities, the value-added of

electricity, water and waste treatment activities

rebounded by 3.9 per cent in 2021, compared

to 0.8 per cent contraction recorded in 2020.

The largest contributor to the improvement in

this category, electricity, gas, steam and air

conditioning supply activities grew by 6.1 per cent

during the year compared to the contraction of 1.6

per cent recorded in 2020. Considering electricity

generation data, the total electricity generation

increased significantly in 2021, mainly due to higher

demand from the industry sector with the recovery

in the economy. Among the other sub-economic

activities within the category, water collection,

treatment, and supply activities grew by 4.3 per

cent during the year compared to 4.8 per cent

growth in 2020. However, sewerage, waste

treatment, and disposal activities declined by

3.3 per cent in 2021 on top of the 1.0 per cent

decline recorded in 2020.

Services

With the rebuilding of economic interaction

and pick-up in household consumption, the

value-added of Services activities climbed up

by 3.0 per cent in 2021, from the 1.6 per cent

downturn in 2020. The recovery was upheld by

the expansion in financial services while wholesale

and retail trade activities and real estate activities

also expanded during the year, benefitting

from the relaxed pandemic-related restrictions.

Further, supplemented by the pandemic-induced

demand, IT programming, telecommunication and

health activities also expanded during the period.

Moreover, the recovery in other personal service

activities, professional services, insurance and

transportation services, together with the growth in

public administration, education services and postal

and courier services also contributed positively

to the overall growth. Moreover, accommodation,

food and beverage service activities rebounded

during the year, recording a moderate growth after

two consecutive years of contraction. Mirroring

the services performance, the PMI for Services

activities, compiled monthly by the Central Bank,

indicated an overall expansion. Moreover, the

Demand and Sales sub-indices of the BOS related

to Services activities denoted an increase on

average during the year, indicating the pickup in

Services activities.

Wholesale and Retail Trade

Wholesale and retail trade activities

recorded a moderate growth of 2.0 per cent in

value-added terms in 2021, compared to 1.4 per

cent growth recorded in 2020, induced by the

policy stimuli and relaxed mobility restrictions.

The trade activities were sustained by the gradual

adoption of the country to conduct operations

under the 'new normal'. Further, the Government

also provided periodic liquidity support by way of

financial assistance, buoying the disposable income

of consumers. The total imports volume index

recorded an increase during the year, mainly due

to imports of investment and intermediate goods,

while the volume of consumer goods imported

recorded only a marginal decline. Moreover, loans

and advances to the private sector provided by

Licensed Commercial Banks for wholesale and

retail trade activities increased substantially at the

end of 2021, compared to end 2020.

Transportation and Storage

With the intermittent imposition of mobility

restrictions, the value-added of transportation

activities recovered marginally by 0.6 per cent,

compared to 6.8 per cent decline recorded in

2020. Transportation activities that were adversely

affected from the onset of the pandemic indicated

an improvement during early 2021, yet was later

dampened by the emergence of the third wave of the

pandemic. However, the easing of mobility restrictions

from the beginning of the fourth quarter benefitted the

revival of the transportation activities. Even though

passenger conveyance was adversely affected due

to the lower usage and the limited availability of public

transportation during the pandemic-hit periods, the

goods transportation, as an essential service, was

broadly uninterrupted during 2021 compared to the

previous year. The operations in seaports stepped

up during the year despite the abating of global

supply chains. Accordingly, an increase in container

handling (in terms of Twenty-Foot Equivalent

Units) and cargo handling was observed during

the year. Further, the freight kilometers flown by Sri

Lankan Airlines also increased in 2021. However,

the passenger kilometers operated by the Sri

Lanka Transport Board, private bus operators and

Sri Lankan Airlines continued to contract during 2021.

Accommodation and Food Service Activities

The gradual rebound in tourist arrivals and

staycations provided impetus to the value-

added of accommodation, food and beverage

service activities to recover by 1.9 per cent in

2021, compared to 39.4 per cent contraction

recorded in 2020. Tourism-related activities were

hit hard by the pandemic due to the imposition of

international and domestic travel restrictions. The

country gradually lifted inbound travel restrictions

by introducing bio-bubbles for international

tourists along with attractive tour packages,

resulting in a strong month-on-month growth in

tourist arrivals towards the latter part of the year.

Further, domestic tourism activities rebounded

during the year as many hotels offered exclusive

discounts for local travellers. Nevertheless, the

recovery of accommodation, food, and beverage

service activities was largely hindered by the third

wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Financial, Insurance and Real Estate Activities including Ownership of Dwellings

Continued increase in financial services

steered the value-added of financial, insurance,

and real estate activities including ownership

of dwellings which grew by 5.6 per cent in 2021,

compared to 4.7 per cent growth recorded in

2020. Accordingly, financial services activities and

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

82

auxiliary financial services expanded by 7.5 per

cent, compared to 10.9 per cent growth in 2020.

Reflecting the continuous expansion in financial

services, the loan book of banks and non-bank

financial institutions increased substantially during

the year while the deposit base also expanded,

despite the challenging environment. Further, as

pointed out in the Credit Supply Survey conducted

by the Central Bank on a quarterly basis, the

demand for credit was at elevated levels due

to the low-interest rate environment while the

willingness to lend was also at healthy levels due

to the surplus liquidity that prevailed for most part

of the year. Meanwhile, insurance, reinsurance,

and pension funding activities recovered by 5.1

per cent in 2021, compared to the contraction of

3.3 per cent recorded in 2020 while the real estate

activities, including ownership of dwellings, grew

by 3.1 per cent in 2021, recovering from 1.2 per

cent contraction experienced in 2020.

Information and Communication

Benefiting from the opportunities opened-

up from the pandemic, the value-added of

telecommunication, and IT programming and

consultancy services continued the momentum

in 2021 growing at a healthy rate of 17.5 per

cent on top of 14.1 per cent growth achieved

in 2020. The telecommunications industry played a

key role in maintaining socio-economic interaction

during the pandemic. Accordingly, the sector

substantially benefitted from the pandemic-induced

extra demand for voice and data with the increased

reliance on work-from-home arrangements,

online education and entertainment. Accordingly,

telecommunication activities grew significantly by

16.2 per cent during the year, compared to 15.4

per cent growth in 2020. The industry responded

strongly to high demand, by extending the coverage

and capacity levels, improving the service quality,

and introducing special packages catering to needs

such as working-from-home and learning-from-

home arrangements. Meanwhile, IT programming

consultancy and related activities also grew

significantly by 21.7 per cent in 2021, compared to

10.0 per cent growth in 2020, underpinned by the

surge in demand for technology-based solutions

such as digital media, networking, cyber security,

cloud computing services, artificial intelligence and

automation.

Other Services Activities

Most of the other service-related economic

activities which dulled in 2020 due to the

adverse impacts of the first two waves of

the COVID-19 pandemic managed to recover

in 2021 despite the disturbances from the

recurrent waves. Accordingly, other personal

services activities consisting of personal services

such as arts, entertainment and recreation, laundry

services, hairdressing and other beauty treatment,

and funeral and related activities, which contracted

by 6.5 per cent in 2020, grew by 1.1 per cent in 2021,

due to the comparatively favourable environment.

Further, professional services activities also grew

by 1.4 per cent in 2021, recovering from the

2.7 per cent contraction recorded in 2020.

Moreover, public administration and defense

activities grew by 1.9 per cent in 2021, compared

to the 1.6 per cent growth observed in 2020 while

human health activities which remained active

during the pandemic grew by 5.7 per cent in 2021

on top of 4.3 per cent growth recorded in 2020.

Further, education, postal and courier services,

and programming and broadcasting activities also

contributed positively to overall economic growth

during the year.

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE, INCOME AND EMPLOYMENT

Introduction

Micro, Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (MSMEs) remain the core and account for the vast majority of enterprises, while providing a significant source of employment, yielding a greater proportion of output in most countries around the world. They account for about two thirds of employment and contribute to more than 50 per cent of GDP in many countries.1 Contribution of the MSME sector to the economic output is generally found to be higher in high income countries than in medium and low income countries, highlighting the potential of their contribution to growth, particularly in developing nations (Gonzales, Hommes and Laura, 2014).

Generally, MSMEs span across all forms of social clusters, including rural and low income areas, with a large share of such firms being informal establishments. It is also reported that there are about 365-445 million MSMEs in emerging economies, while over three-fourths of such establishments are found to be informal enterprises (International Labour Organization, 2016). MSMEs appear to heavily contribute to increasing the income levels of low income families, and thereby contribute to reducing disparities in the income distribution. Further, as a result of their small size and customer centric business models, small businesses are also more flexible and better able to withstand changes in the economic landscape by adapting to the changing environment and new advancements in technology. Therefore, MSMEs can improve the resilience of an economy up to a certain extent and pave the way for growth and development.

BOX 4Catalysing Micro, Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (MSMEs) as a Growth Driver and Challenges

MSMEs as a Growth Driver

A considerable body of literature provides statistical evidence to prove a positive relationship between the existence of MSMEs and the overall economic growth of a country. Successful MSMEs usually evolve into large organisations, and such organisations contribute to economic growth immensely. MSMEs make an important contribution to the economy as a breeding ground for large firms, an employment provider, and a facilitator of innovation, thereby leading to inclusive and balanced growth.

A breeding ground for large organisations: Most successful economies comprise a healthy mix of both large and small firms. Large firms typically are more productive, have the capacity to invest in capital intensive projects, facilitate research and development on a larger scale, and in turn facilitate the creation of new knowledge contributing to yield growth episodes. On the other hand, MSMEs play an important role by acting as a breeding ground for such large organisations, which in turn would promote the businesses of MSMEs by expanding supply chains. Most modern global business giants, such as Samsung, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook initiated their operations as small businesses and developed gradually into their current status, thus highlighting the potential of such small businesses to transform into any scale, and ultimately drive respective national and regional economies. In fact, a healthy MSME sector can contribute to improving entrepreneurship skills among the general population of a country, in turn augmenting human capital, which is a prerequisite for sustainable growth.

MSMEs increase employment and overall output in an economy: MSMEs, being the largest segment involving a significantly large number of enterprises, provide employment opportunities for the majority of the population. This in turn help in increasing the spending power of the general public, which drives up consumption and boosts overall economic growth. As MSMEs span across multiple sectors of the economy, empowering a large number of people in terms of livelihood and contributing to reducing inequality, these establishments play an important role in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), thereby supporting respective economies to record sustainable growth episodes. Further, as achievements of SDGs generally cast a positive image on countries, a healthy MSME sector can play an indirect role to support economies by improving investor sentiments as well.

MSMEs increase competition among firms: MSMEs can increase competition in their respective business environments by identifying niche business propositions. Under an enabling environment, increased levels of competition created by MSMEs can encourage innovative ideas, which is an essential element of sustained growth

1 Based on data from the MSME Economic Indicators Database 2019, available at SME Finance Forum (https://www.smefinanceforum.org), which contains secondary data of registered MSMEs in 176 countries. Information for the latest available year is considered, which may not necessarily be the same for all countries. Due to differences in source institutions and time, data are not standardised, thereby somewhat limiting country comparability. Based on availability, the numbers of data points used to arrive at median values are 80 for employment share and 38 for value added share.

paths. Recent successes of fresh ideas such as Uber and Lyft for ridesharing and Airbnb for homestay facilities, and the multitude of similar adaptations provide evidence for the innovative capacity of MSMEs and how they can enrich the lives of numerous stakeholders, who are not usually parts of large traditional organisations.

Importance of MSMEs in Developing and Emerging Economies

The contribution of MSMEs to the development process is particularly important for emerging and developing economies as they play an effective role in alleviating poverty by facilitating sustainable development and innovation. As per the estimates of the World Bank, about 600 million jobs will be needed by 2030 in order to accommodate the growing population. Given typically high levels of population growth in developing countries, the role of MSMEs as an employment provider becomes extremely vital. In this regard, MSMEs are more important than large organisations, as MSMEs are generally more labour intensive and have the potential to absorb large labour forces in developing and emerging countries. Further, developing countries can utilise MSMEs to address issues such as improving female labour force participation, effective use of underutilised natural resources, and diversifying economic activities across various sectors. At the same time, the innovative capacity of MSMEs, given enabling conditions, could assist developing and emerging economies to avoid growth stagnation, enabling them to elevate into higher income countries. It is noted that the growth prospects of Asian economies, such as Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, India etc., are driven by small businesses which are innovative, highlighting the importance of policy support to facilitate innovative activities in MSMEs (Asian Productivity Organization, 2015).

Challenges Faced by MSMEs

Although certain characteristics, for example, the small size of MSMEs, can be advantageous in some areas, the nature of MSMEs can sometimes become an issue, leading to substantial challenges, such as those discussed below, ultimately leading to low productivity of MSMEs in comparison to large firms.

Limited access to finance: Difficulties in access to finance is one of the key obstacles faced by MSMEs across many countries. As proved in studies, such limited access to finance remains the main hindrance to the growth of MSMEs. As a result, undertaking capital intensive projects is difficult for most of these establishments. Reasons highlighted in the literature for difficulties of MSMEs in obtaining services of formal financial institutions include, among others, information asymmetry, limited availability and low quality of collateral, low financial literacy of MSMEs, high delinquency rates, and limited expertise of lenders themselves in assessing MSME ventures. As a result of these limitations, attracting financing via banks, especially for project financing, becomes particularly difficult without collateral.

Limited business skills and inability to retain human resources: Lack of expertise in fields such as finance, accounting, taxation, human resource management and marketing which are integral elements for the success of any business endeavour, also remains a key issue observed in MSMEs. Moreover, by nature, MSMEs lack the buffers to absorb large losses, thus they are highly vulnerable to business cycles and shocks emanating from domestic and international fronts. Inability to retain key employees is also perceived as a concern hindering the progress of MSMEs. In many instances, job opportunities provided by MSMEs tend to be temporary, driving employees to constantly search for other opportunities. At the same time, MSMEs often cannot compete on pay and benefits offered by large organisations, especially for skilled workers, thus resulting in higher worker turnover and the inability to retain such skilled workers, who are capable of driving the development of small businesses. As a result, many such businesses tend to be managed and run by the owners themselves, which in turn can result in management, governance, finance and sustainability issues, even for successful ventures.

Regulatory barriers and incoherent policy: MSMEs also face difficulties due to regulatory barriers in many countries, across various aspects such as business registration, quality and environmental standards, reporting requirements, taxation etc. However, depending on the country, these difficulties and their impact can vary significantly. For example, even though regulatory barriers have seen a large reduction in OECD countries over the last decade or so, the complexity of such barriers remains diverse across countries (OECD, 2018). Small businesses typically do not have the capacity to effectively study regulatory complexities due to the low availability of skills and funding. As a result, overall limitations in the doing-business environment could lead to multiple difficulties for MSMEs, which may especially be the case with developing countries, as they operate with relatively weak institutional infrastructure. Further, lack of policy consistency and less transparency also adds to these regulatory barriers faced by MSMEs.

Low market share and limited access to markets: MSMEs also face challenges in maintaining revenue streams and suffer from low sales in general, mainly due to low market share and weak accessibility of markets. This can be contributed by various reasons such as, among others, inability to spend on large advertising budgets, limited networking channels, limited use of social media and limited online presence, and weaknesses in adopting new technology leading to comparatively lower market access.

Lack of information and data on MSMEs: Information on MSMEs is typically difficult to obtain in many countries, particularly in developing economies. Unlike large organisations, which typically have to publish information, particularly in relation to financial data, MSMEs usually do not have such requirements and hence information is usually held private, forcing lenders to incur costs to obtain reliable information, and in turn discouraging them to lend to MSMEs (Yoshino

Guarantee Corporation Malaysia Berhad in Malaysia, etc.), establishing development banks specialising in lending to high risk projects with non- or less-profit oriented motives (for example, China Development Bank in China, Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW Bankengruppe) in Germany, Korea Development Bank in Korea, etc.), implementing policy measures such as imposing lending targets to drive lending by formal financial institutions to small businesses, donor financing via multinational agencies, improving access to alternative channels of financing, such as crowd funding and angel investors, and measures to reduce information asymmetries, such as developing MSME databases with information required by lenders (for example, the Credit Risk Database of Japan, which aims at enhancing the efficiency of credit supply to MSMEs with financial information of a large number of small businesses).

Supporting winners: In addition to addressing concerns regarding financial difficulties of MSMEs, several other programmes are used worldwide to provide overall assistance to establishments in the sector. For example, some countries such as Korea have used a ‘picking winners approach’, where assistance is targeted to industries and businesses with growth potential and organisational capacity in line with national priorities. However, there are criticisms against such a policy as well, since it could lead to suboptimal resource allocation. Nevertheless, it is a policy that could be used to guide resources to intended sectors, especially during times when market driven allocations do not reach areas of growth potential.

Clustering and improving linkages: Global market liberalisation and globalisation could lead MSMEs to a disadvantageous position due to capacity mismatch against international players. In this regard, creating clusters of businesses and linking MSMEs with the value chains of large organisations, such as the Industrial Linkage Programme of Malaysia, could assist MSMEs to compete in international markets. Moreover, subcontracting linkages between large enterprises and MSMEs can enhance the productivity of the industry, while providing benefits to MSMEs in terms of easier acquisition of new technologies, management methods, marketing and input materials, and production techniques (Wijesinha, 2011).

Targeted support: National prioritisation programmes, such as the SME Promotion Plan in Thailand, whereby the economic contribution of MSMEs is expected to be enhanced (OECD/ERIA, 2018), can also streamline the efforts to support MSMEs in a country. Low use of information technology by MSMEs is often cited as a key area that needs to be improved. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, even businesses which did not have any virtual presence started to embrace online tools to reach customers and suppliers. However, MSMEs stand to gain much more by embracing information technology products and services into their businesses. In this regard, governments and support groups can play a vital role by improving the

and Taghizadeh-Hesary, 2016). This is a hindrance to the development of MSMEs, as it does not only prevent financial institutions’ ability to evaluate these businesses, but also limits availability, quality and timeliness of research on the MSME sector.

Impact of the pandemic and other developments: MSMEs across the world endured difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic, which created large losses in revenue and increased uncertainty. Although the unprecedented levels of policy support by governments and other authorities may have helped these businesses to weather this difficult period, many of them have not recovered fully. The uncertainty in the global political landscape due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict may also create difficulties for MSMEs, particularly for those who are linked with value chains, exports and services trades such as tourism.

Gender-wise disparities: The participation of women entrepreneurs in MSMEs is found to vary across countries. Studies report about one third of formal small businesses are owned by women, although this share ranges from a high of more than 40 per cent in East Asia and the Pacific to a low of below 10 per cent in South Asia (IFC, 2014). In addition to common challenges faced by small businesses, women owned MSMEs face additional hindrances, depending on cultural biases, and relatively low levels of size and networks. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is also found to be disproportionate on women-owned MSMEs, where a larger proportion of women-owned businesses than men-owned businesses are found to be affected by the pandemic and are likely not to survive (United Nations, 2021). However, there exists evidence to suggest that women-owned MSMEs are performing well, although often overlooked by financial institutions (IFC, 2014). Women entrepreneurs are better at achieving development goals, as women are found to reinvest more in families and communities (International Trade Centre, 2014), thus highlighting the importance of continuous commitment to address these gender-wise disparities to achieve inclusive growth.

Successful Strategies to Promote the MSME Sector

A variety of strategies have been used by different countries to address common problems faced by MSMEs.

Addressing financing difficulties: As many MSMEs find it difficult to access finance from formal channels, strategies to minimise this limitation can often contribute to the growth of MSMEs. Moreover, many other challenges faced by small businesses are also linked to low capacity, often as a result of funding difficulties. In this regard, some of the successful strategies undertaken by various countries include introducing credit guarantee schemes that address limitations of collateral based lending by financial institutions (for example, the multitude of credit guarantee corporations in Japan, the Korea Credit Guarantee Fund and the Korea Technology Finance Corporation in Korea, the Credit

awareness on the advantages of utilising information technology, by way of programmes such as the Digital MSME Scheme in India, which aims to enhance the adoption of information technology by MSMEs.2 Multilateral donor agencies also support capacity development of MSMEs, thereby contributing to improve business skills of these entrepreneurs. Further, given the commitment of most governments over the world, and the community drive to address climate change, businesses engaged in ‘Green Activities’ and those who promote sustainable business practices can also obtain financial support from various public, private and multinational agencies, while they can enjoy improved market presence as well.

Overall, measures that facilitate sustainable growth, which allow countries to avoid growth stagnation, pave way for the development of the MSME sector as well. For example, efforts to create a knowledge based economy with an emphasis on developing new knowledge is considered a main success factor of the Korean economy and its MSME sector (Gregory et al., 2002). Similarly, improvements to the education system with a focus on improving skills relevant to businesses via vocational training, which has been reported as a key driver of the success of German MSMEs (Herr and Nettekoven, 2018) can contribute to creating small businesses empowered with skills needed to compete in the modern globalised marketplace.

MSMEs in Sri Lanka3

MSMEs play a major role in the development process in Sri Lanka by providing employment to a large proportion of the population. Nevertheless, many of the common hurdles to their development discussed above are faced by Sri Lankan MSMEs as well. Despite their importance to the economic output of the country, which is reported in excess of 50 per cent,4 most Sri Lankan MSMEs may not have reached their true potential due to capacity limitations (often linked with limited access to finance), low adoption of technology and limited linkages to value chains, both domestic and global. Driven by low financial literacy and difficulties in accessing the formal financial system due to a variety of reasons, many small businesses in Sri Lanka end up utilising the services of unregistered money lenders, who are widely spread across the country, providing financial services at extremely high interest rates. Subsequently, many such entrepreneurs face difficulties in meeting high interest costs, thereby threatening the viability of their business ventures. The informal nature of such lending services makes it hard to track such activities, thereby limiting the ability to take effective regulatory actions as well. Meanwhile, like in other countries, lack of information has also been a serious limitation to making a meaningful assessment of MSMEs in Sri Lanka, while also making it difficult to

assess the impact of informal market lenders, in order to properly evaluate whether their role is a facilitative or an exploitative one. There have been efforts to support these businesses by both governmental and non-governmental bodies at different points in time. For example, the National Policy Framework for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) Development of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (2016) comprise detailed action plans for the development of the MSME sector. However, the implementation and coordination of such policies remain weak, requiring further improvements in the implementation process. The Central Bank also plays an important facilitating role in supporting small businesses under its agency function of regional development. Accordingly, both financial and non-financial support is provided, together with participatory financial institutions and a number of other resource providers. Meanwhile, the large policy support extended to MSMEs during the pandemic could have helped the sector to stay afloat during this difficult period. However, in general, MSMEs in Sri Lanka are yet to exploit new normal opportunities created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, the prevailing uncertainty of the global and domestic economic activity can be harmful to MSMEs, which require remedial and preventive policies. Going forward, timely measures are required for the implementation of ‘enablers’, including the expeditious operationalisation of the proposed credit guarantee institution and the establishment of a dedicated development bank, in order to extend the required sustained support for MSMEs to prevail and prosper through challenging times. Overall, policy initiatives need to be coordinated with a national drive to embrace MSMEs, which are often neglected, in order to bring them into the mainstream business environment.

2.5 Expenditure

Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE), which

consists of consumption and investment

expenditure of the economy, grew by a higher

rate of 13.1 per cent in 2021 at current prices,

compared to the marginal growth of 0.5 per

cent in 2020, supported by the expansion in

both consumption and investment expenditure.

The accommodative monetary policy stance,

as well as fiscal policy stimuli, bolstered the

final consumption expenditure. Accordingly,

consumption expenditure increased significantly by

9.9 per cent in 2021, being the major contributor of

GDE while investment expenditure also rebounded

by recording a significant growth of 23.2 per cent

during the year. On the external front, net external

demand at current prices contracted significantly by

31.6 per cent in 2021, compared to the contraction

of 5.1 per cent recorded in 2020. This was due

to the growth of 25.7 per cent in import of goods

and services, which outpaced the 23.3 per cent

growth recorded in export of goods and services,

partly owing to high import prices prevailed during

the period. Accordingly, GDP at current prices,

which is the aggregate of GDE and the net external

demand, recorded a growth of 11.9 per cent in

2021, compared to the marginal growth of 0.2 per

cent in 2020. Considering the estimates at constant

prices, consumption and investment expenditure

grew by 3.5 per cent and 3.0 per cent, respectively,

in 2021. Consequently, GDE recorded a moderate

growth of 3.4 per cent in 2021, compared to

the contraction of 4.6 per cent in 2020. In the

meantime, net external demand at constant (2010)

prices recorded only a marginal contraction of 0.4

per cent in 2021, benefitting from the higher growth

in the volume of exports. Consequently, GDP at

constant (2010) prices grew by 3.7 per cent in 2021

compared to the contraction of 3.6 per cent in 2020.

Consumption

Consumption expenditure, which is the

largest expenditure category accounting for

74.3 per cent of the aggregate expenditure of the

economy at current prices, grew at a favourable

rate of 9.9 per cent during the year, compared to

the moderate growth of 2.0 per cent recorded in

2020, induced by the rebound in consumption

demand with expanded space for consumer

spending. The growth in consumption expenditure

was mainly attributable to the considerable growth

in the main consumption expenditure category,

private consumption expenditure (PCE), which

accounted for 88.0 per cent of the total consumption

expenditure. The higher nominal consumption

expenditure reflected the impact of elevated prices

of most consumer goods categories, particularly

during the latter part of the year. In the meantime,

the government consumption expenditure (GCE)

grew at a moderate pace in 2021, compared to the

previous year.

Private Consumption Expenditure (PCE) at

current prices recorded a significant growth of

10.8 per cent in 2021, compared to the marginal

growth of 1.0 per cent in 2020, as consumers

were keen to spend following the opening

up of the economy. The gradual easing of

pandemic-related restrictions coupled with fiscal

as well as monetary policy stimuli encouraged

returning consumers to the markets. This

supported the growths in PCE categories such

as transport, restaurants and hotels, and clothing

and footwear. Further, the PCE categories, which

include essential goods and services such as PCE

on food and non-alcoholic beverages, housing,

water, electricity, gas and other fuels, health and

communication also expanded during the year.

GCE at current prices, which comprises

the collective final consumption expenditure

and individual final consumption expenditure

of the government, grew by 3.7 per cent in

2021, compared to the growth of 9.9 per cent

in 2020. Individual consumption expenditure

of the government, which particularly includes

government’s spending on health and education,

expanded moderately by 1.0 per cent in 2021,

on top of the higher growth of 17.8 per cent

reported in 2020. Further, collective consumption

expenditure such as defence, public services and

social protection, which comprises the general

government's expenditure on services that benefit

the community as a whole, grew by 5.3 per cent

in 2021, compared to the growth of 5.8 per cent in

2020. The government’s continued involvement in

curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic also contributed

to the expansion in GCE.

Investment

Benefitting from the gradual rebound

in economic activities and targeted policy

stimuli to shore up recovery, the investment

expenditure at current market prices grew

by 23.2 per cent in 2021, recovering from

the contraction of 4.2 per cent recorded in

2020. This recovery was largely driven by the

considerable growth in gross fixed capital

formation by 14.5 per cent in 2021, compared

to the contraction of 6.0 per cent in the previous

year. Accordingly, the major asset categories

of gross fixed capital formation, such as

construction, transport equipment, and machinery

and equipment, expanded in 2021, recovering

from the setback in 2020. Further, investment

expenditure on categories such as Information and

Communication Technology (ICT) equipment and

intellectual property products, as well as, changes

in inventories and acquisitions less disposals of

valuables recorded a considerable increase in 2021.

Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs), including

loans received by BOI companies during the

year, increased by 13.6 per cent to US dollars

780.2 million5 in 2021, compared to US dollars

687.0 million recorded in 2020. A recovery in

FDI inflows were recorded in the major sectors

including manufacturing sector, services sector,

and infrastructure projects, while FDI inflows to

the agriculture sector continued to remain low in

2021. Further, the total value of projects approved

during the year by the BOI under Sections 16 and

17 of the BOI Act No. 4 of 1978, is estimated at Rs.

517.4 billion, registering an expansion of 22.1 per

cent compared to 2020. The estimated investment

value of projects that commenced commercial

operations under Sections 16 and 17 of the BOI

Act amounted to Rs. 1,672.3 billion and Rs. 36.7

billion, respectively, recording an overall expansion

of 8.1 per cent in 2021 compared to the previous

year.

5 This includes receipts, including loans, to companies registered with the BOI and differs from the estimates presented in Chapter 5, mainly due to the inclusion of FDIs to non-BOI companies in the latter. Accordingly, total FDIs amounted to US dollars 784 millions in 2021.

Availability and Utilisation of Resources

The available resources of the economy

expanded in 2021 by 14.4 per cent at current

market prices in comparison to the contraction

of 5.0 per cent recorded in 2020. In this regard,

GDP which represents domestic resources, and

imports which are external resources expanded

in 2021, compared to the previous year, both in

current and constant prices. Considering the

utilisation of available resources, the majority of

resources was utilised for consumption purposes,

which accounted for 63.7 per cent of the total

resource utilisation in 2021. Meanwhile, at current

prices, the share of resources utilised for export

and investment purposes increased during the

year. At constant prices, the share of resources

utilised for export purposes increased while that

for investment purposes decreased.

Savings

Both domestic and national savings of the economy at current prices rebounded in 2021. Accordingly, domestic savings grew by 20.3 per cent in 2021 largely driven by the increase in private savings during the year. Meanwhile, an upsurge was reported in government dis-savings, mainly due to the lower government revenue. Consequently, domestic savings as a percentage of GDP increased to 20.1 per cent in 2021. In the meantime, in rupee terms, net primary income recorded an improvement, while net current transfers from the rest of the world contracted in 2021. As a combined outcome of these developments, national savings grew by 13.2 per cent to 23.8 per cent of GDP in 2021. Further, the national savings-investment gap

widened to 3.9 per cent of GDP in 2021, from 1.6

per cent of GDP in 2020, due to the significant

growth in investment expenditure.

2.6 Income

Gross Operating Surplus (GOS) continued to

be the largest income component of the economy

in 2021, followed by Compensation of Employees

(CE) and taxes less subsidies on production.

GOS grew by 13.6 per cent at current prices in

2021, accounting for 64.4 per cent of GDP. This

growth was mainly attributable to the expansion

in Net Operating Surplus (NOS) during the year.

When considering other major sources of income,

both CE as well as taxes less subsidies on

production expanded during the year. Meanwhile,

HH and NPISH sector continued to be the largest

contributor to the income within the institutional

sector classification, followed by NFC, GG, and FC.

2.7 Population, Labour Force and Employment

Population

The mid-year population in Sri Lanka was

estimated at 22.156 million in 2021 as per the

mid-year population estimates compiled by the

Registrar General’s Department. Accordingly,

the population growth rate increased considerably

to 1.1 per cent in 2021 from 0.5 per cent recorded

in 2020. The Western province was the largest

contributor towards population growth followed

by the Eastern province. Meanwhile, the lowest

contributions towards population growth were from

the Uva and Northern provinces. The Western

province continued to account for the highest share

of mid-year population of 28.1 per cent, followed

by the Central and Southern provinces accounting

for shares of 12.7 per cent and 12.2 per cent of

the mid-year population, respectively, in 2021,

continuing the same trend observed. Meanwhile,

the Northern province continued to account for the

lowest share of mid-year population of 5.3 per cent.

In line with the population growth, the population

density also increased to 353 people per square

kilometre in 2021, from 350 people per square

kilometre in 2020. As seen in the recent years,

the female population continued to remain higher

than the male population and the share of elderly

population remained at the same significant level

during the period under review.

Labour Force

The labour force, which is the economically

active population,6 increased to 8.553 million

in 2021 from 8.467 million recorded in 2020,

recording a growth of 1.0 per cent. This growth

was driven by the increases in labour force in all three

sectors namely, urban, rural and estate. Meanwhile,

the economically inactive population also increased

significantly further to 8.581 million in 2021 from

8.273 million in 2020 with the subdued interest in

active job search and pandemic induced hardships

on usual routines. This increase was largely driven

by the increase in the inactivity in the rural sector,

particularly related to rural females. Following the

increase in both labour force and inactive population,

the labour force participation rate (LFPR), which

is the ratio of the labour force to the household

population, decreased to 49.9 per cent in 2021 from

50.6 per cent in 2020. Accordingly, the male and

female LFPRs also decreased to 71.0 per cent and

31.8 per cent, respectively, in 2021 from

71.9 per cent and 32.0 per cent, respectively, in

2020. On a positive note, the gender gap in LFPR

reduced to 39.2 per cent in 2021 from 39.8 per cent

in 2020, however yet to return to pre-pandemic levels.

Employment

The employed population7 increased to

8.114 million in 2021 from 7.999 million in

2020, though not yet recovered up to the

pre-pandemic employment levels. The increase

in employment was mainly driven by the increase

in employment opportunities related to Agriculture

and Services activities. Accordingly, employment

in Agriculture increased to 2.213 million in 2021

from 2.170 million in 2020, while that of Services

increased to 3.791 million in 2021 from 3.677 million

in 2020. However, amid the persistent adversities

faced, the employment in Industry continued to

decline to 2.109 million in 2021 from 2.153 million

in 2020. Accordingly, the shares of employment in

the Agriculture and Services sectors increased to

27.3 per cent and 46.7 per cent, respectively, in

2021 from 27.1 per cent and 46.0 per cent in 2020,

whereas the share of employment in the Industry

sector declined to 26.0 per cent in 2021 from

26.9 per cent in 2020.

As per the Public Sector Employment

Survey conducted by the Central Bank,

total public sector employment increased to

1.493 million at the end of 2021 compared to

1.461 million in 2020. This includes employees in

ministries, departments, district secretariats, divisional

7 Persons who worked at least one hour during the reference period, as paid employees, employers, own account workers or contributing family workers are said to be employed. This also includes persons with a job but not at work during the reference period.

secretariats, provincial councils and semi government

institutions. The increase observed in public sector

employment was due to the continued recruitment of

unemployed graduates and multi task development

officers, and recruitments related to armed and

police forces, and health sector. Meanwhile, as per

the quarterly labour force survey conducted by the

DCS, public sector employees, employers and own

account workers increased notably in 2021 compared

to 2020, whereas the private sector employment

declined marginally in line with the continued

terminations amidst the interminable difficulties

encountered by the private sector companies due

to the pandemic. Nevertheless, the private sector

continued to remain the main employment generator

in Sri Lanka representing the largest share of 42.0

per cent followed by own account workers, which

accounted for 33.4 per cent of the total employment

during 2021.

Unemployment

The unemployment rate declined to 5.1

per cent in 2021 from 5.5 per cent recorded in

2020 in line with the creation of new employment

opportunities. Accordingly, the unemployed

population8 declined to 0.440 million in 2021 from

0.468 million recorded in 2020. Consequently, the

male and female unemployment rates declined to

3.7 per cent and 7.9 per cent, respectively, in 2021

8 Persons available and/or looking for work, and who did not work and took steps to find a job during the last four weeks and are ready to accept a job given a work opportunity within next two weeks are said to be unemployed.

from 4.0 per cent and 8.5 per cent, respectively, in

2020. Further, the unemployment rate of the GCE

A/L and above category, declined considerably to 9.1

per cent in 2021 from 9.8 per cent recorded in 2020.

However, the youth (15-24 years) unemployment

rate remained unchanged at 26.5 per cent in 2021

compared to 2020 indicating the continued lack

of job opportunities at the entry level. Further, the

overall unemployment rate still remains above the

pre-pandemic levels as job opportunities created in

2021 were insufficient to reverse the considerable

number of terminations that took place in 2020 and

continued in 2021.

Foreign Employment

Departures for foreign employment

recorded a significant growth of 126.8 per cent

to 121,795 in 2021 from 53,711 in 2020 in line

with the significant improvement in departures

towards the latter part of the year. Accordingly,

the departures for foreign employment in the final

quarter of 2021 was recorded at 61,447, highest ever

reported since the third quarter of 2016. Relaxed

travel restrictions and increase in employment

opportunities in labour receiving countries, the

large number of prospective migrant workers who

were waiting to travel overseas for jobs and the fast

vaccination of prospective migrant workers drove

this significant increase in departures for foreign

employment. Accordingly, the share of male and

female departures for foreign employment stood

at 66.2 per cent and 33.8 per cent, respectively,

to the total departures of foreign employment.

In line with the increase in total departures for foreign

employment, departures for foreign employment

under all categories, namely professional, middle

level, clerical and related, skilled, semi-skilled,

unskilled and housemaid improved, where the

major contributions were from the skilled, unskilled

and housemaid categories. The Middle East region

continued to lead as the key foreign employment

destination in 2021 as well, accounting for 84.8

per cent of the total departures for foreign

employment, with 87.7 per cent of those being to

departures for foreign employment is envisaged for

2022 amid further improvements observed during

the first quarter of 2022.

Labour Productivity

Labour productivity, measured in terms

of Gross Value Added (GVA) (in 2010 prices)

per hour worked, declined by 2.6 per cent to

Rs. 562.15 per hour worked in 2021 from

Rs. 577.36 per hour worked in 2020.9

Even though, increases in GVA were observed

related to all three activities namely, Agriculture,

9 The significant increase in labour productivity in 2020 was due to the substantial reduction in hours worked amid tighter mobility restrictions that prevailed to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Industry and Services in 2021 compared to

2020, the overall labour productivity declined

slightly solely due to the considerable

recovery in hours worked amid lesser

mobility restrictions prevailed during the year.

Accordingly, labour productivity in Agriculture,

Industry and Services activities declined to

Rs. 175.64 per hour worked, Rs. 598.78 per hour

worked and Rs. 734.94 per hour worked,

respectively, in 2021 from Rs. 178.37 per hour

worked, Rs. 611.90 per hour worked and

Rs. 764.25 per hour worked, respectively, in 2020.

In terms of the level of productivity, Services

activities continued to exhibit the most efficient use

of labour resources, recording the highest labour

productivity level, followed by Industry activities,

while Agriculture activities recorded the lowest.

3.1 OverviewT

he economic and social infrastructure base of the country continued to facilitate the continuity of

economic activity while ensuring the socioeconomic well-being of the people amidst the prolonging

COVID-19 pandemic, with the emergence of new variants. A key challenge during 2021 was the

soaring prices of energy commodities in global markets, driven by the recovery in world demand and limited

increases in supply; this price trend continues to worsen with the geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe.

Accordingly, although the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation undertook two rounds of price revisions in 2021,

these were insufficient in the wake of further increases in global prices as well as the sharp depreciation of the

rupee in early 2022. This led to another sharp price adjustment in the early part of 2022. The financial status

of key State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs) in the energy sector continued to remain disconcerting

in the absence of cost-reflective adjustments to prices and tariffs in a timely manner. The long standing

financial issues of these SOBEs and the dearth of foreign exchange inflows have culminated in an energy

crisis in the country posing a substantial dampening effect on overall activity as the economy strives to reset

in the post COVID-19 era. Recognising the importance of investments in the socioeconomic infrastructure

base of the economy, the Government continued to undertake initiatives focused at improving rural-urban

linkages and the quality of living spaces. Milestones during the year include the enactments of legislation

relating to the Colombo Port City project and the exploration of Petroleum resources, the opening of the

first waste-to-energy plant in Kerawalapitiya and the opening of the New Kelani Bridge followed by the

opening of another section of the Central Expressway in January 2022. Amid these physical infrastructure

developments, the Government also remained committed to the provision of healthcare and education

services, which are expected to have played a large role in mitigating short-term and long-term impacts of

the COVID-19 pandemic on the population. Since the onset of the pandemic, the health sector has been

at the helm of containing the spread of COVID-19 through the provision of not only testing, treatment and

quarantining facilities but also importantly, the timely deployment of the COVID-19 vaccine and booster

doses, amidst the challenges of non-communicable and other communicable diseases, such as Dengue.

While the education sector seemed to have adapted to the ‘new normal’ of online education, facilitated

by the telecommunications sector of the country, concerns remain about the quality of learning outcomes

especially among rural and estate households whose ownership of technological devices and related

literacy levels are low and also among those located in peripheral areas with poor internet connectivity.

For the second consecutive year, amid fiscal constraints, the Government paid allowances and provided

relief measures to households and individuals rendered vulnerable by the COVID-19 pandemic. Poverty

related statistics highlight that the prolonging of the pandemic and the disruptions that it has entailed are

likely to have created a ‘new poor’ segment of the population who remain at the brink of poverty and are

more prone to scarring in the wake of any further disruptions to economic activity stemming from COVID-19

or otherwise. While investments in the economic and social infrastructure base of the country may be

challenging within a limited fiscal space, it must be recognised that the investments made by successive

governments over several decades have enabled Sri Lanka to safeguard businesses, households and

individuals, to a large extent, from any scarring effects stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. However,

in order to ensure the efficacy of such investments, it is necessary for the Government to encourage multi-

stakeholder collaborations across the public and private sector to devise forward-looking and holistic policies

and streamlined strategies that focus not only on fixing short-term issues but also on building the productive

potential of the economy in a sustainable manner over the medium-term. This will be essential to enhance

the resilience of the economy to volatilities and shocks, thereby assuring the economy’s sustained progress

onto a high and inclusive growth trajectory.

3.2 Economic Infrastructure Policies, Institutional Framework and Performance

Petroleum

Global crude oil prices rose sharply in

2021, supported by the steady recovery in

global economic growth as well as tight

supply conditions, although some downward

pressures were observed due to resurgences

of COVID-19. Although the average crude oil price

(Brent) stood at US dollars 43.35 per barrel in 2020,

due to the contraction in global demand induced

by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the turnaround in

the global economy and the relaxation of pandemic

related mobility restrictions, the average crude oil

price in international markets rose by 63.3 per cent

to US dollars 70.80 per barrel in 2021. The recovery

in global crude oil prices that began in mid-2020

gained pace and reached pre-pandemic levels by

March 2021 before reaching seven-year highs in

October 2021. The West Texas Intermediate (WTI)

price was also on a rising trend and recorded an

average of US dollars 67.94 per barrel in 2021

compared to US dollars 39.78 per barrel recorded

in 2020. The surge in global crude oil prices was

primarily driven by optimism surrounding the global

recovery process and the resultant rise in global

demand amidst tight global oil supply conditions

maintained by the Organisation of the Petroleum

Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies. Brief

episodes of downward pressures were observed

due to demand concerns stemming from the

resurgence of COVID-19 and the emergence of

new variants of the virus, which compelled the

imposition of temporary lockdowns and mobility

restriction measures. Global crude oil prices

escalated further and briefly reached US dollars

140 per barrel in March 2022 for the first time

since July 2008 following concerns that geopolitical

tensions between Russia and Ukraine could lead

to further tightening of supplies. In line with rising

trends in global crude oil prices, the average price

of crude oil imported by the Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation (CPC) increased by 51.1 per cent to

US dollars 68.86 per barrel in 2021 compared to

the average of US dollars 45.57 per barrel recorded

during 2020.

The continuous escalation of global crude oil

prices warranted the Government to increase

the domestic retail prices of key petroleum

products in 2021 after a hiatus of over one and

half years. Accordingly, domestic prices of the

CPC were revised upwards in June and December

2021, followed by a substantial upward revision

in March 2022. The Lanka IOC PLC (LIOC)

also revised domestic retail prices of petroleum

products in three rounds during 2021 followed by

two rounds of revisions in February 2022 followed

by another two rounds of revisions in March 2022.

The revisions undertaken in March 2022 by both

entities were historically high and were undertaken

to reflect the sharp rise in global crude oil prices

and the impact of the depreciation of the rupee in

March 2022. This reiterates the need to urgently

institutionalise a cost reflective pricing mechanism

that improves transparency regarding pricing

among all stakeholders, especially consumers,

which can contribute to the general acceptance of

such revisions. Such a mechanism is also essential

to ensure the financial viability of the CPC in the

medium-term and thereby the safeguarding of

macroeconomic and financial system stability,

although such revisions could lead to transitory

shocks to general price levels in the country. It

must also be reiterated that the current crisis of

lack of continuous supply of fuels to the domestic

market could also be partly attributed to the

absence of forward-looking and dynamic strategic

planning with due consideration to the continuously

evolving developments in the global and domestic

markets. Transparency in relation to both pricing

and procurement processes is a dire need for the

viability and sustainability of the CPC.

The overall sales volumes of petroleum

products in the domestic market declined by 7.7

per cent during the year, driven by contractions

in sales to the power sector. Several economic

activities were allowed to be pursued throughout the

April and August outbreaks of COVID-19 resulting

in a rebound in economic activity during 2021. In

turn, sales volume of the CPC to the transport,

industrial and aviation sectors grew by 10.4 per

cent, 39.5 per cent and 18.6 per cent, respectively.

Meanwhile, the increased reliance on hydropower

generation due to healthy water levels in reservoirs

resulted in the sales of diesel and furnace oil for

power generation registering notable contractions

of 23.2 per cent and 35.9 per cent, respectively,

thereby dampening the overall sales performance

of the CPC.

Refinery output recorded an overall decline

of 24.7 per cent in 2021 due to multiple closures

of the Sapugaskanda refinery. Subsequent to a

closure from mid February 2021 for the purpose

of general maintenance, the refinery was closed

again in November 2021 for three weeks due to

unavailability of crude oil for refinery operations.

Hence, overall crude oil throughput declined by 24.5

per cent, while refinery output of key products such

as diesel, petrol, fuel oil and naphtha contracted

by 31.1 per cent, 24.5 per cent, 22.9 per cent and

31.9 per cent, respectively, during the period under

review. These production gaps were compensated

for through the importation of refined products by

the CPC which had risen by 15.2 per cent during

the year.

Despite notable upward revisions to

domestic petroleum prices, the financial

performance of the CPC worsened further

in 2021. As per unaudited provisional financial

statements, the CPC incurred an operational

loss of Rs. 41.7 billion in 2021 compared to the

operational profit of Rs. 33.9 billion recorded in

the previous year, reflecting the impact of delayed

and inadequate revision of prices in line with the

sharp increase in global crude oil prices. Sales of

petroleum products to the major sectors of transport

and power generation yielded operational losses,

while the aviation and industry sectors generated

operational profits in 2021. The depreciation of the

rupee against the US dollar resulted in a notable

exchange rate variation loss of Rs. 33.2 billion

to the CPC during the year, weighing negatively

on the overall loss (before taxes), which stood

at Rs. 82.2 billion in 2021 in comparison to the

profit of Rs. 2.4 billion recorded in the previous

year. Meanwhile, borrowings of the CPC from

the banking sector increased by Rs. 123.5 billion

to Rs. 505.3 billion in 2021, while deposits with

domestic licensed commercial banks increased by

Rs. 76.2 billion to Rs. 140.1 billion by end 2021.

The CPC’s total outstanding trade receivables from

public corporations increased to Rs. 161.1 billion

in 2021 from Rs. 142.7 billion in 2020, mainly

due to the growing liabilities owed by the Ceylon

Electricity Board (CEB) and SriLankan Airlines.

Accordingly, by end 2021, trade receivables from

the CEB and SriLankan Airlines accounted for

around 90.1 per cent of total trade receivables of

the CPC. The worsening financial position of the

CPC, alongside the dearth of foreign exchange

flows, led to hindrances in timely and cost-efficient

fuel procurement. In January 2022, the Central

Bank intervened to facilitate the distribution of

the financing of essential import bills for fuel

purchases among the licensed banks in proportion

to their foreign exchange flows with the intention

of facilitating the timely procurement of fuel and

reducing the reliance of the CPC on the two state-

owned banks. The Government also secured a

short-term line of credit amounting to US dollars

500 million from the Export-Import Bank of India in

early 2022, specifically for the purchase of refined

petroleum products from India.

There is an urgent need for the CPC to

undertake concerted efforts to ensure the

continuity of supply of petroleum products

in a financially viable manner. The sensitivity

of demand for petroleum products, especially

from the transport sector, to price revisions is

relatively low in Sri Lanka. This can be observed

in the sales volumes of the CPC to the transport

sector standing at 3.6 billion litres in 2021, in

comparison to the average sales volume of

3.4 billion litres during the period from 2015 till

2019. This is further evidenced by the continued

strong demand for petroleum products amid the

historically high price revisions undertaken in

the early part of 2022. With due consideration to

this growing demand for petroleum products, it is

essential that specific initiatives are undertaken

by the Ministry of Energy in close collaboration

with the CPC and other relevant stakeholders in

the electricity and transport sector to identify other

means of demand management for petroleum

products, such as through the expansion of

renewable electricity generation capacity and,

the undertaking of qualitative improvements in

public transportation combined with measures

such as congestion charges or tolls to discourage

the use of private transportation, among others.

The ongoing issues in the energy sector reiterate

that there is a strong need for the CPC to engage

in forward-looking decision making with due

consideration to developments in domestic and

global markets. Whilst the supply disruptions seen

in the recent months are partly stemming from

issues in foreign currency liquidity, the extent of

these supply disruptions could have been reduced

through timely and prudent decisions, undertaken

by the CPC in a concerted manner with the CEB

and other related public stakeholders.

Several infrastructure development

projects aimed at improving the performance

and productivity of the petroleum industry

were carried out during the year, albeit at a

slower pace. The detailed feasibility study for the

establishment of a new refinery in Sapugaskanda

as a Public-Private Partnership under a Built-

Operate-Transfer model with a capacity of

100,000 barrels per day was completed by the

CPC in 2021. Meanwhile, in order to improve the

storage facilities available for petroleum products,

two storage construction projects comprising

total capacity of 93,000m3 in Kolonnawa were

also under progress during the year. The

CPC also commenced the development and

upgrading of the Aviation Refueling Terminal as

a part of the Bandaranaike International Airport

(BIA) development project. In addition, the CPC

continued to work in collaboration with the CEB

to construct the pipeline conveying gas to the

Kelanitissa power plant under the proposed

Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) power project.

Accordingly, land acquisition and evaluation of

project proposals commenced in 2021 and the

project is expected to be completed by 2023.

In early 2022, an agreement was signed for the

Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm Development project

to be carried out in collaboration with the Indian

Oil Corporation (IOC). Accordingly, of the 99 oil

tanks in the Trincomalee Oil Storage Complex, 24

are to be allocated to the CPC and another 61

are to be upgraded by a subsidiary that is to be

established as a joint venture between the CPC

and IOC, while the remaining 14 tanks are to be

developed by the IOC.

The Government continued to engage in

developing a national plan for upstream oil and

gas exploration during 2021. The Petroleum

Resources Act No. 21 of 2021 was enacted in

October 2021 with the primary aim of establishing

an independent, efficient and transparent upstream

legislative framework, thereby creating a clear

national upstream policy and a regulatory and

operational framework to oversee and manage

petroleum resources and related operations.

Following the enactment of the new Petroleum

Resources Act, the Petroleum Development

Authority of Sri Lanka (PDASL) was established in

October 2021 as an independent regulator in lieu of

the Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat

(PRDS). Further, in line with international block

demarcation processes and current trends, a

new offshore hydrocarbon exploration block map

comprising 871 small blocks and three large blocks

covering the Mannar, Cauvery and Lanka Basins,

was devised and gazetted in July 2021. Further,

in line with the National Policy on Natural Gas,

which was gazetted in 2020, initial work relating to

the drafting of the Gas Utilisation Master Plan was

underway began in 2021 and it is expected to be

launched during early 2022 by the PDASL.

Electricity

Electricity demand continued to expand in

line with the recovery in economic activity in

2021. During the year, electricity generation grew

by 6.4 per cent to 16,716 GWh, compared to the

previous year, with increased share of hydropower

generation. Water levels in reservoirs remained

above 60 per cent throughout the year owing to heavy

rainfall in catchment areas, thereby contributing

to the increased reliance on low-cost hydropower

generation to meet electricity demand. Accordingly,

total electricity generation through hydro sources

increased by 44.2 per cent to 5,640 GWh, while the

share of hydropower in total electricity generation

increased to 34 per cent in 2021 from 25 per cent

recorded in 2020. This also resulted in reduced

reliance on fuel oil based power generation which

declined by 37.0 per cent to 2,634 GWh while coal

power generation contracted by 4.1 per cent to 5,519

GWh during the period under review. Meanwhile,

power generation through Non-Conventional

Renewable Energy (NCRE) sources registered a

significant growth of 56.6 per cent to 2,922 GWh,

largely driven by the addition of new renewable

energy plants to the national grid, particularly the 100

MW Mannar wind plant. Accordingly, the shares of

fuel oil, coal, and NCRE power generation in the total

generation mix stood at 16 per cent, 33 per cent, and

17 per cent, respectively. Further, the share of power

generated by the CEB out of total power generation

stood at 76.0 per cent in 2021, while the remainder

was purchased from Independent Power Producers

(IPPs). The overall transmission and distribution

loss as a percentage of total power generation

was maintained at 9.0 per cent in 2021 despite the

expansion of electricity supply to remote and rural

areas. From early 2022, there was a turnaround in the

reliance on hydropower generation due to the rapid

depletion of reservoir water levels amid the onset of

dry weather conditions. Due to the resultant increase

in reliance on thermal-based power generation, the

CEB has been experiencing difficulties in meeting the

energy demand of the economy in the early months

of 2022. Difficulties in fuel procurement caused by

foreign exchange issues within the country amidst

soaring global prices of energy commodities led to

the implementation of load shedding since February

2022.

Electricity sales increased by 6.5 per cent to

15,214 GWh in 2021, owing primarily to the lower

base induced by the reduced demand in 2020.

The overall growth in sales was driven by demand

from all user categories, except for religious and

street lighting purposes. Electricity sales to the

hotel sector, which accounts for 1.4 per cent of

total sales, increased notably by 13.7 per cent in

2021, compared to the sharp decline of 29.2 per

cent observed in 2020, highlighting the recovery

in the tourism sector during the year. Meanwhile,

the CEB continued to face difficulties in manual

meter reading resulting in significant mismatches

between electricity sales and electricity generation

data. Accordingly, the CEB has taken initiatives to

collect accurate and real-time energy data through

remote disconnection and automatic reconnection

facilities. Two commercial scale smart metering

projects were initiated in Dehiwala and Katunayake.

Acceleration of such timely initiatives is essential, as

rapid implementation of smart metering technologies

would ensure smooth billing and collection of dues

in a prompt and efficient manner, thereby improving

the cash flows of the CEB.

Increased reliance on hydropower generation,

combined with a low share of costly fuel oil

based electricity generation helped improve

the financial performance of the CEB during

2021. However, this was insufficient to offset losses

incurred during the year as well as those from the

past. As per unaudited provisional financial data,

the CEB recorded a loss of Rs. 22.0 billion in 2021,

compared to a loss of Rs. 69.2 billion reported in

2020. Short term borrowings of the CEB from banks

and other outstanding liabilities to the CPC and IPPs

increased to Rs. 237.8 billion by end 2021 from

Rs. 208.4 billion recorded by end 2020, while the

CEB’s long term outstanding liabilities increased to

Rs. 502.8 billion by end 2021 from Rs. 483.8 billion

recorded at end 2020. The Government’s decision

to provide a grace period to settle electricity bills

and to defer the disconnecting of services to unpaid

consumers worsened the cash flow position of

the CEB. The CEB's financial performance could

deteriorate further in 2022 on account of revisions to

domestic fuel prices in early 2022 and on prospects

of increases in energy commodity prices during the

remainder of 2022. These developments reiterate

the urgent need to implement a cost reflective

pricing mechanism for electricity tariffs and to

undertake regular revisions especially considering

that electricity tariffs have not been revised since

2014. Initiatives to increase the power generation

capacity through expansion of renewable energy

sources are also essential.

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri

Lanka (PUCSL), the regulatory authority for

the electricity sector, continued to strengthen

its monitoring and regulatory activities in

order to ensure the provision of continuous

power supply. The CEB submitted its Long-Term

Generation Expansion Plan for 2022-2041 (LTGEP)

in October 2021 for the approval of the PUCSL. The

plan outlines that the renewable energy share will

be about 50 per cent of total electricity generation

by 2030. However, the PUCSL requested the

new coal power plants in the near future to ensure

sustainable energy development and to reiterate

its commitment to providing clean energy. The

decision was in line with the commitment made

under the United Nations Framework Convention

on Climate Change to achieve carbon neutrality by

2050. Meanwhile, other monitoring and regulatory

aspects of electricity, such as the development

of a National Electrician Licensing Framework,

inspections of renewable power plants, and

training for electricians and technicians, were

underway during the year.

Activities related to the development of

several power plants were in progress during

the year with the aim of expanding energy

generation to keep pace with the steady growth

in electricity demand. Given the expected

reliance on LNG as one of the main sources of

electricity generation, as per the LTGEP, the

Cabinet of Ministers granted approval for the

construction of Sri Lanka's first LNG power plant at

Kerawalapitiya. Accordingly, construction of the

first 300 MW power plant commenced in March

2021 and is expected to be connected to the

national grid by early 2024, while the second 300

MW plant was at the initial stages of construction

and is expected to be completed by the end of 2024.

The CEB initiated a competitive bidding process

for the construction of LNG terminal facilities

consisting of a Floating Storage Regasification

Unit, on a Build-Own-Operate basis, and a delivery

pipeline, on a Build-Operate-Transfer basis.

These LNG based power plants are expected to

be equipped with dual fuel capability, including

fuel supply and storage arrangements, in order to

ensure continuity of supply in case of disruptions

to LNG supply. Further, several transmission and

distribution projects, including the Green Power

Development and Energy Efficiency Improvement

Project, Greater Colombo Transmission and Loss

Reduction Project and Power System Reliability

Strengthening Project, were underway to expand

and strengthen the power transmission and

distribution system in order to reduce system

losses and to include more renewable energy

while maintaining system reliability.

The Government continued its efforts to

ensure the sustainability of the power sector

by increasing renewable energy generation.

Accordingly, the key hydropower projects, the

Uma Oya (120 MW) and Broadlands (35 MW)

projects were nearing completion as at end 2021

and both are expected to be commissioned in

2022. Meanwhile, the Moragolla, Gin Ganga, and

Thalpitigala hydropower projects were in progress

during the year, and these plants are expected to

add a total capacity of 65 MW to the national grid.

With the successful commissioning of the first

large-scale 100 MW Mannar wind power plant

(Phase I) at its full capacity in mid-2021, plans have

been made to add another 50 MW to the national

grid from this plant. Initiatives were also taken to

establish two 100 MW wind parks in two phases

in Mannar, while development activities relating

to wind plants located in the Pooneryn hybrid

renewable energy park and Trincomalee are also

under progress. In relation to solar energy, at the

end of 2021, around 27,068 consumers had joined

the Soorya Bala Sangramaya project and 416 MW

were added to the national grid under this project.

Meanwhile, initial activities of the Siyambalanduwa

solar power park (100 MW) and Pooneryn hybrid

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

107

renewable energy park (150 MW) were underway

during the year. A loan agreement for US dollars

100 million was signed with India in June 2021

to install rooftop solar plants on government

buildings and religious organisations, as well as

for floating solar pilot projects. Accordingly, this

project is expected to add an additional 120 MW

of solar capacity to the grid. Sri Lanka also signed

an agreement with the National Thermal Power

Corporation (NTPC) of India in March 2022 to set

up a solar power plant in Sampur, Trincomalee. As

a new initiative in power generation, Sri Lanka’s first

waste to energy power plant in Kerawalapitiya, with

a capacity of 10 MW, commenced its operations in

February 2021. Although a number of renewable

energy projects are in the pipeline, these proposed

and planned projects must be implemented in an

expeditious manner to avoid power shortages and

to prevent resorting to generation through high cost

alternatives, while also ensuring the achievement

of the Government’s policy target of meeting 70

per cent renewable energy share in the overall

generation mix. Furthermore, it is essential to

develop a consistent policy framework to formulate

an appropriate and sustainable energy mix, taking

into account long run economic costs as well as

the high capital investment and maintenance cost,

and the externalities of energy sources on the

environment and society. Accordingly, a Cabinet

Subcommittee was appointed in February 2022

to develop strategic plans for renewable energy

development and propose measures to mitigate

potential lapses in the implementation of proposed

renewable energy projects.

The Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority

(SLSEA) continued its efforts to encourage

sustainable energy development in the country.

The SLSEA engaged in energy conservation

activities, such as the establishment of Energy

Management Systems and the Energy Labelling

Programme, to facilitate the energy security of

the country. The Renewable Energy Resource

Development Plan for 2021-2026 was also compiled

with due consideration to the optimal utilisation of

renewable energy resources and identification

of land resources and potential transmission

systems for the projects. In addition, the SLSEA

was involved in the process of issuing energy

permits and provisional approvals for renewable

energy projects to accelerate the development of

indigenous renewable resources into commercial

scale projects.

Road Development

Initiatives of the Road Development

Authority (RDA), focused on improving rural-

urban connectivity, were continued with the aim

of improving the quality of road transportation

to reduce transit time, while also improving

the comfortable passage of both people and

goods. During the year, the total length of National

Highways (A and B class roads) maintained by the

RDA was approximately 12,225 km, while the total

length of expressways was 312.6 km. Activities

pertaining to the enhancement of the road network

via maintenance, development of expressways

and highways, widening and improvement of

roads, constructions of bridges and flyovers,

and the rehabilitation of natural disaster-affected

roads rehabilitation led the RDA to incur about

Rs. 200.8 billion. The expenditure incurred on the

development of expressways and highways stood

at Rs. 19.0 billion and Rs. 155.9 billion, respectively,

while expenditure related to the construction of

bridges and flyovers amounted to Rs. 14.7 billion

for the year.

Despite challenges relating to the availability

of labour and importation of construction

materials, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,

the Government steadfastly continued to

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

108

strengthen the expressway network of the

country to ensure improved urban-rural

linkages and thereby reinforce inclusive

growth. Accordingly, construction activities

pertaining to the Central Expressway that spans

from Kadawatha to Dambulla were prioritised

during the year enabling the section spanning

from Meerigama to Kurunegala was opened to

the public since mid January 2022. Moreover,

preliminary construction activities pertaining to the

first 12 km of the expressway from Pothuhera to

Rambukkana also commenced during the year.

Construction activities of the section extending

from Kadawatha to Meerigama was underway,

while the progress of land acquisition and

resettlement for section IV of the project from

Kurunegala to Dambulla stood at 70.7 per cent

as at the end of 2021. Meanwhile, construction

activities of the Ruwanpura Expressway from

Kahathuduwa to Palmadulla, spanning a length

of 76 km, were underway during the year.

Accordingly, construction activities of phase I of

the expressway spanning from Kahathuduwa to

Ingiriya commenced during the year. Further,

phase II and III from Ingiriya to Palmadulla will

commence after the RDA completes the revisiting

of the relevant feasibility study.

Overall vehicular traffic along the

expressways grew in 2021. Accordingly, the

average number of vehicles that travelled on a

daily basis on the Southern Expressway from

Kottawa to Godagama and from Palatuwa to

Mattala, increased by 2.7 per cent and 30.4

per cent, respectively, in 2020. Meanwhile, the

daily numbers of vehicles plying the Colombo

Katunayake Expressway and the Outer Circular

Highway recorded growths of 6.7 per cent and 38.8

per cent, respectively, compared to the previous

year. With these positive developments, the

revenue from expressways rose to approximately

Rs. 8.8 billion recording a 20.6 per cent growth in

annual revenue in 2021. Since the opening of the

section of the Central Expressway spanning from

Meerigama to Kurunegala in mid-January 2022,

toll collection for this section was recorded at Rs.

134.4 million as at end February 2022.

Activities related to the development and

rehabilitation of the existing road network

and bridges continued during the year. The

opening of the New Kelani Bridge at Peliyagoda in

late November 2021 was a key milestone in terms

of ongoing initiatives to mitigate traffic congestion

in the Colombo metropolitan area. This project is

located in the midst of a key transportation hub

that links the BIA and the Port of Colombo. The

newly opened six-lane bridge with its elevated

road leading to the city is expected to alleviate

the traffic congestion that could be seen in the

area over the past several years. Several other

road development projects were initiated during

the year, such as the construction of flyovers in

Slave Island and at the Gatambe and Kohuwala

junctions. The Southern Road Connectivity Project

(SRCP) which focuses on developing connectivity

of the southern roads, particularly with the

Southern Expressway, was also underway during

the year alongside the Badulla - Chenkaladi Road

Improvement Project (A005). Meanwhile, land

acquisition and resettlement activities relating to

the construction of the elevated highway from the

New Kelani Bridge to the Outer Circular Highway

were continued while the Environmental Impact

Assessment (EIA) for the section spanning from

Rajagiriya to Athurugiriya was in progress during

the year.

Road Passenger Transportation

The overall performance of road passenger

transportation activities continued to remain

subdued in 2021, reflecting limited transport

3

operations by both the public and private sector

amidst the intermittent imposition of mobility

restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19

and the increased preference for private

transportation. Consequently, operations of the

Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) and private

bus operators recorded notable declines in 2021.

Accordingly, during the year, operated kilometrage

and passenger kilometrage of the SLTB declined

by 19.7 per cent and 28.4 per cent, respectively,

while the average number of buses operated in

2021 increased to 4,449 buses from 4,045 buses

recorded in 2020, which was around 85.7 per cent

of the fleet that was effectively available for public

transportation operations of the SLTB during the

period. Meanwhile, the average number of buses

operated by the private sector declined by 16.1 per

cent to 9,053 buses in 2021 from 10,787 buses

recorded in the previous year. During the year,

passenger kilometrage and operated kilometrage

of private bus operators also contracted by 12.2 per

cent and 4.4 per cent, respectively. As at end 2021,

the National Transport Commission (NTC) had

issued 1,978 inter-provincial permits and 16,914

intra-provincial permits for private bus operations.

The NTC continued to work towards

expanding safe public transport facilities

during 2021 while adhering to health guidelines

issued, especially in relation to restricted

seating capacity, in order curb the spread

of COVID-19. Accordingly, several special bus

services, including Sisu Seriya, Gemi Seriya and

Nisi Seriya were continued in line with COVID-19

related health guidelines. Around 97 new services

were added to the Sisu Seriya service to facilitate

the transportation of school children. As at end

2021, there were 1,563 services in operation under

the Sisu Seriya programme, 194 services under

the Nisi Seriya programme and 14 services under

the Gemi Seriya rural bus service programme.

In view of further expanding this project, the NTC

granted approval to the SLTB to add 305 new Nisi

Seriya services during the year. The NTC also

commenced 59 new bus services, covering the

Southern, Sabaragamuwa, Uva, and North Central

provinces.

The two rounds of revisions to domestic

prices of fuel in 2021 and the revision undertaken

in March 2022 prompted the NTC to revise bus

fares upward. Accordingly, fares of normal, luxury

and semi-luxury bus services were revised upward

by an average of 17.4 per cent in December 2021

resulting in the minimum bus fare increasing from

Rs. 14.00 to Rs. 17.00. The revised fares came

into effect from 05 January 2022. Another round

of revisions took place in March 2022 leading to

an average increase of bus fares by 15.0 per cent,

with the minimum bus fare being revised upwards

to Rs. 20.00.

The financial performance of the SLTB

continued to deteriorate in 2021 with the decline

in operations during the period under review. As

per unaudited financial statements, total revenue

of the SLTB declined by 13.7 per cent to Rs. 26.9

billion in 2021, while total expenditure also declined

by around 9.1 per cent to Rs. 30.4 billion. The SLTB

recorded an operational loss of Rs. 3.4 billion in

2021 compared to an operational loss of Rs. 2.2

billion recorded in the previous year. During the

year, the subsidy provided by the Government to

undertake operations on uneconomical routes and

to facilitate subsidised season tickets amounted

to Rs.12.2 billion. Meanwhile, the SLTB continued

to carry out several initiatives to enhance its fleet

and thereby improve its service provisioning to

commuters. Accordingly, around 213 buses were

added to the fleet after rehabilitation, while the

Cabinet of Ministers granted approval to procure

500 new buses for the SLTB under the Indian line

of credit in early 2022.

Reflecting the impact of controls imposed

on the importation of non-essential imports

since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic,

new registrations of motor vehicles continued

to contract in 2021. New registration of motor

vehicles declined notably by 83.3 per cent,

compared to a decline of 44.8 per cent during

2020. The reduction was witnessed across all

major categories of motor vehicles during the

period under review, with new registrations of

single cabs, motor cars, motorcycles and dual

purposes vehicles recording declines of over 80

per cent.

registered an operating loss of Rs. 10.3 billion during

the year, compared to a loss of Rs. 10.1 billion in 2020.

The total revenue of the SLR stood at Rs. 2.7 billion

with a notable decrease of 41.3 per cent in 2021 in

comparison to the previous year, mainly due to the

contraction in revenue generated from passenger

transport by 53.0 percent. This decline in revenue

was driven by the April and August outbreaks of

COVID-19. During the year, total expenditure of the

SLR decreased by 17.1 per cent to Rs. 40.4 billion,

as recurrent and capital expenditure decreased by

11.2 per cent and 19.6 per cent, respectively, to Rs.

13.0 billion and Rs. 27.4 billion, respectively. Key

reasons for the decline in recurrent expenditure were

the reduction of personnel emoluments as well as

the decline in fuel expenditure due to the reduction

in operations.

The SLR carried out infrastructure

development and service improvement activities

in 2021, albeit at a slower pace. All enhancements

and maintenance activities to track networks,

progressed, although at a modest pace amid

disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the year, double tracking of the railway line

from Kurana to Negombo was completed, whilst the

double tracking of the 5 km railway line from Kandy

to Sarasavi Uyana commenced. The project to

rehabilitate 200 passenger coaches that commenced

in 2020 was completed and the rehabilitation work of

another 100 passenger carriages was commenced

as an extension of the project, while releasing 30

passenger carriages back into service in 2021.

Under the Indian credit line secured in 2017, two air-

conditioned power sets were procured and added

to the train fleet, while the procurement of 120

passenger coaches was underway during the year.

Maintenance activities of railway bridges located

on the main line, coastal line, Puttalam line, Kelani

Valley line, Matale line, Northern line and Eastern

line were under progress during the year. Several

projects pertaining to the provisioning of signaling

and telecommunication systems were also carried

out during the year.

Civil Aviation

The performance of the civil aviation industry

continued to remain modest with the dampened

appetite for travel amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Accordingly, passenger arrivals continued to

decline by 36.8 per cent in 2021 following the sharp

decline of 76.0 per cent observed in 2020. Aircraft

movements recorded a marginal decline in 2021

compared to the previous year. The performance

of the sector was buoyed by public stakeholders’

commitment towards ensuring strict adherence to

COVID-19 related guidelines, while ensuring the

smooth transit of passengers. In addition to the BIA,

the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA)

also obtained the Airport Health Accreditation

Certificate from the Airports Council International

(ACI), for being compliant with international health

and safety guidelines. Meanwhile, a Rapid PCR

Testing Service facility was also established at

the BIA, catering to the special requirements of

passengers traveling to certain destinations in the

Middle East. Since March 2022, inbound passengers

who are fully vaccinated and those below the age of

12 years no longer require COVID-19 PCR tests or

Rapid Antigen Tests. Such measures of restoring

normalcy to travel alongside the gradual abatement

of the pandemic are expected to facilitate the steady

recovery of the sector.

Despite some hindrances caused by

the COVID-19 pandemic, several aviation

development projects were underway albeit at a

slower pace. The Airport and Aviation Services (Sri

Lanka) Limited (AASL) continued to progress with

the construction of the second terminal at the BIA

(Package A). In November 2021, the remote apron

and taxiways (Package B) were opened for use by

airlines. Moreover, as at end 2021, 75 per cent of the

construction of the new taxiway with an additional

apron area had been completed under the Colombo

International Airport Ratmalana Master Plan – Way

to 2030.

The weak financial performance of SriLankan

Airlines (SLA) recorded some improvement

amid the reopening of Sri Lankan borders for

international travel in early 2021 and the overall

improvement in global appetite for travel. SLA’s

operating loss declined to Rs. 14.3 billion during

the nine months ending December 2021, thereby

registering an improvement of 49.3 per cent

compared to the corresponding period of 2020.

This improvement during the period under review

stemmed from the growth in revenue by 152.9 per

cent which exceeded the increase in operating

expenditure by 54.9 per cent. Notable initiatives that

enabled significant improvement in the operations of

SLA included the renewed focus on cargo operations

not only to continue export operations, but also for

the transportation of essential medical supplies and

vaccinations. During the year, SLA also increased

its cross-border commercial cargo operations and

also expanded to several new destinations during

the year enabling the continued operation of its

fleet. SLA continued to be actively engaged in Sri

Lanka’s tourism initiatives by being the official airline

for a key global adventure sporting event held in Sri

Lanka in March 2022.

Port Services

The port activities rebounded sharply in

2021 with operations exceeding pre-pandemic

levels. Despite the slowdown observed at the

beginning of the year, a turnaround in port activities

was observed throughout the year except for the

months of August and September, where the rapid

spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19 posed

some hindrances to port operations. During the year,

7.2 million Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) of

containers and 109,369 metric tons of cargo were

handled, surpassing historical highs. Accordingly,

the Port of Colombo registered expansions in

container and cargo handling of 5.8 per cent and

6.3 per cent, respectively. Further, the Colombo

International Container Terminals (CICT) and Sri

Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) recorded growths in

both cargo handling and container handling, while

the South Asia Gateway Terminals (SAGT) reported

a marginal decline. Notably, CICT handled over

3 million TEUs for the first time since its inception

a decade ago. Of the total volume of containers

handled at the Port of Colombo, CICT, SLPA and

SAGT accounted for 44.3 per cent, 30.3 per cent

and 25.4 per cent, respectively. During the year,

390,069 TEUs were handled by the East Container

Terminal (ECT) that was opened in October 2020.

With the increased arrivals of larger ships, overall

ship arrivals recorded a contraction in 2021 despite

the expansion in operations. The Colombo Port

continued to be ranked high on international rankings

such as the Container Port Performance Index (17th

position), compiled by the World Bank and IHS

Markit and on the Port Liner Shipping Connectivity

Index (17th position) compiled by the United Nations

Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)

highlighting the strong potential of the Colombo Port

to emerge as a leading maritime hub in the region.

Major infrastructure development initiatives

of the Colombo Ports steadily continued during

the year despite COVID-19 related disruptions.

The construction of the second phase of the ECT

commenced in January 2022, while the Build-

Operate-Transfer agreement for the West Container

Terminal (WCT) spanning 35 years was signed

between a foreign investor, a local investor and the

SLPA. Upon the expected completion of the ECT and

WCT by 2025 and 2026, respectively, the capacity

of the Port of Colombo is expected to be enhanced

by 6 million TEUs. Further, according to the

National Port Master Plan (NPMP), the preliminary

design and feasibility study to implement a new

Port Communication System (PCS) commenced

during 2021. Activities pertaining to the undertaking

of the feasibility study of the Colombo North Port

development project and call for Expressions of

Interest (EOI) to develop the Port of Galle as a fully-

fledged port for tourism were also underway during

the year.

Despite the extremely low performance

of domestic vehicle handling, total vehicle

handling at the Hambantota Port grew by 40.4

per cent during 2021 recording the highest

growth since the start of its operations, entirely

driven by transshipments. Accordingly, the total

number of vehicles handled at the Hambantota

Port stood at 493,400, of which 489,942 were vehicle

transshipments. While vehicle transshipments

registered a growth of 46.3 per cent, domestic

vehicle handling recorded a steep decline of 76.9

per cent with the continuation of restrictions on

motor vehicle importation.

The financial performance of the SLPA

improved in 2021 with the increase in port

activities. Accordingly, the SLPA recorded profits

before tax of Rs. 25.6 billion in 2021 compared to that

of Rs. 20.3 billion recorded in 2020. Total revenue of

the SLPA grew by 16.8 per cent to Rs. 45.5 billion,

and operating expenditure also increased by 10.7

per cent to Rs. 32.9 billion during the year.

Communication Services

The telecommunications sector continued

to expand in 2021, particularly facilitating the

contemporary communication needs of the

economy, emerging from the challenges of

the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As observed in 2020, the telecommunications

sector continued to play a pivotal role in ensuring

the continuity of economic activity during the year.

The rising adoption of online platforms for a myriad

of economic activities paved way for the healthy

pace of growth of the sector. Consequently,

the total mobile connections, fixed wireline and

wireless telephone connections continued to grow

alongside the improvements in telephone and

mobile penetration.

Internet usage also registered a significant

growth, largely driven by the adoption of

‘work-from-home’ arrangements and the

continuation of educational activities through

virtual learning platforms. Accordingly, total

internet connections grew by 26.9 per cent with the

rise in both mobile and fixed internet connections.

Further, internet density, which measures the

number of internet connections per 100 persons,

increased to 100.4 in 2021 compared to 79.9

recorded in 2020, reflecting the rapid transition of

activities, particularly related to the services sector,

to online platforms. In the meantime, total data

usage which has been on an upward trend since

October 2020 with the outbreak of the second

wave of the COVID-19 pandemic registered a

gradual moderation in the first quarter of 2021

alongside the removal of mobility restrictions from

early 2021. However, with the onset of the third

wave of the pandemic in end April 2021, a rapid

growth in internet data usage was witnessed, in

line with the imposition of mobility restrictions and

the changeover to online working and education

arrangements. The pace of growth declined from

October 2021 onwards with the removal of mobility

restrictions and the restoration of normalcy to the

economy.

With due recognition given to the importance

of digital transformation in tandem with the post

COVID-19 recovery process, the implementation

of the National Digital Transformation Strategy

(2021-2024) was commenced during the year.

continued to spearhead initiatives relating to the

digital transformation of the economy, such as the

Sri Lanka Unique Digital Identity, eLand Registry,

Digital Health Project, Digital Library Project, Lanka

Government Network 2.0, and Lanka Government

Cloud 2.0. In addition to these, ICTA also

developed email, video conferencing and digital

form submission facilities to enable the continuity

of services provided by government institutions

amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The performance of the Department of Posts

(DoP) continued to remain modest amid the

disruptions caused by the pandemic. Although

postal services were hindered by the third wave of

the pandemic and related COVID-19 containment

measures, with postal services being declared an

‘essential service’ by the Government in June 2021,

the DOP adopted measures to continue its service

delivery through the adoption of novel approaches.

The ‘Cash on Delivery’ services which were re-

launched in late 2020 continued successfully

during 2021 generating an income of Rs. 34.0

million. Meanwhile, the DOP also continued to

facilitate the payment of pensions of government

servants and those in the fisheries sector, along

with other social services allowances during

the year, while facilitating the free distribution of

medicine. These key services were provided,

without any disruptions, through the network of the

DOP comprising 654 main post offices, 3,410 sub

post offices and 130 private post offices, covering

8,157 delivery areas island-wide. However, the

financial position of the DOP continued to remain

weak in 2021 with an operational loss of Rs. 7.2

billion compared to a loss of Rs. 7.7 billion in 2020,

highlighting the need for the DOP to devise novel

value-added services in line with the ongoing

digital transformation and the evolving needs of

consumers.

Technology Agency (ICTA) to spearhead the

implementation of this which comprises the three

key programme pillars of Digital Government,

Digital Economy and Digital Services. While the

Digital Government and Digital Services pillars will

focus on the development of digital infrastructure

across public institutions, the Digital Economy pillar

is expected to focus on the development of local

capacity to enable the generation of annual export

revenue of US dollars 3 billion from the Information

Technology and Business Process Management

(IT-BPM) industry of the economy. Further, with

the intention of effective implementation of the

National Digital Transformation Strategy, a robust

monitoring and evaluation system encompassing

all projects and programmes is being developed to

ensure independent and unbiased governance.

Several other measures complementing

the National Digital Transformation Strategy

were also in progress, led by key stakeholder

institutions, focused on enhancing the

digital infrastructure base of the country. The

Telecommunication Regulatory Commission of Sri

Lanka (TRCSL) carried out the national project

Gamata Sanniwedanaya to improve 4G coverage

in 14,000 Grama Niladhari Divisions across all

districts. The project strives to achieve island

wide 4G coverage by end 2024, while as at end

2021, project activities were underway across 251

sites in ten districts. In order to facilitate distance

learning during the pandemic and to ensure

broader accessibility, the TRCSL ‘whitelisted’ the

eThaksalawa and Lanka Education and Research

Network (LEARN) online education platforms

enabling users to access such platforms without

any data charges. Other key initiatives undertaken

by the TRCSL to facilitate the evolving needs

of consumers were the granting of approval for

‘unlimited internet plans’ and the granting of legal

approval for subscribers to avail ‘mobile number

Water Supply and Irrigation

Provisioning of new water supply

connections continued during 2021 in line with

the Government’s National Policy Framework

which outlines the provision of clean and safe

drinking water for every household by 2025 as

a key thrust area. Accordingly, 192,087 new water

supply connections were provided by the National

Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWS&DB)

reaching a total of 2.8 million connections by the

end of the year. This resulted in an improvement

of households’ access to safe drinking water to

94.4 per cent by end 2021 from 93.2 per cent by

end 2020. However, non-revenue water usage of

the country increased marginally to 25.8 per cent

during the year compared to 24.6 per cent in 2020.

Meanwhile, the NWS&DB recorded an operating

loss of Rs. 3.1 billion during the year, compared

to the loss of Rs. 370.5 million recorded in the

previous year, owing to increases in operation

and maintenance costs during the period under

review.

Various development projects were

carried out under the purview of the Ministry

of Water Supply and NWS&DB in line with

the National Policy Framework. During the

year, activities related to physical work of 118

projects were commenced under the Water for

All flagship pledge made to the public under the

National Policy Framework. Further, with the

aim of improving the volumes of safe drinking

water throughout the country, 33 major water

supply schemes were in progress during 2021.

Meanwhile, the Deduru Oya water supply project,

which commenced in 2016, was completed during

the year, thereby providing safe drinking water

to 97,700 beneficiaries residing in the Maho and

Polpithigama divisional secretariats, while several

other projects including the Kirama Katuwana

water supply project and Katana water supply

project were also completed during 2021. The

Jaffna and Kilinochchi water supply and sanitation

project which aims at improving the provision of

safe drinking water and sanitation facilities in the

Jaffna and Kilinochchi districts achieved progress

of 61 per cent at end 2021. Under this project,

work related to the Thalaiyadi seawater treatment

plant, Nainativu seawater treatment plant and the

Jaffna - Kilinochchi water distribution network were

commenced during the year. Further, the Greater

Matale Water Supply Project, which focuses on

enhancing clean drinking water coverage in the

Matale district achieved progress of 94 per cent

by end 2021.

The Department of Irrigation (DoI)

continued to develop irrigation schemes

across the country to support agriculture

sector performance. Accordingly, the Ellewewa

reservoir project commenced alongside several

other projects such as the rehabilitation of the

Kudavilachchiya reservoir and Dematagala tank.

Further, the provision of irrigation water for smaller

communities continued to be expanded in various

parts of the island as a key initiative under the

Gama Samaga Pilisandara programme. During

the year, 26 major irrigation projects were in

progress incurring a cost of Rs. 5.6 billion, of which

Rs. 2.7 billion and Rs. 556.1 million were spent on

the Yan Oya and Deduru Oya reservoir projects,

respectively. Meanwhile, the Wari Saubhagya

National Programme that aims to rehabilitate

rural tanks and anicuts across all districts was

also commenced under the stewardship of the

DoI in 2021. The project aims to cultivate 50,000

acres of barren paddy field through improvements

to 2,500 village tanks. The Climate Resilience

Improvement Project (CRIP), which commenced

in 2014 with a view to enhancing the resilience

of hydraulic infrastructure against adverse climate

shocks, was completed during 2021. Further, the

Cabinet of Ministers granted approval to revise

upwards the total cost of the Uma Oya downstream

development project to Rs. 17.9 billion from

Rs. 9.4 billion. The project achieved 65 per cent

physical progress by end 2021. Furthermore, the

Productivity Enhancement and Irrigation System

Efficiency Improvement Project (PIESIP), which

was inaugurated in 2017 with the objective of

improving irrigation infrastructure across 72,882

hectares of irrigable lands benefiting 97,832

farmer families, was continued, although at a

slower pace owing to disturbances caused by the

pandemic.

3.3 Social Infrastructure Policies, Institutional Framework and Performance

Health

Despite the outbreaks of COVID-19 during

2021, particularly due to the spread of the Delta

variant, the imposition of appropriate and

timely mobility restrictions by the Government

alongside the globally acclaimed vaccination

drive enabled Sri Lanka to minimise the

human toll of the Omicron variant in early

2022. Following the two waves of the pandemic in

March 2020 and in October 2020, the third wave

of the pandemic emerged in April 2021. At the

peak of the third wave in August 2021, the daily

new confirmed COVID-19 cases (smoothed) per

one million increased to 276 as against 11 cases

per one million population reported till mid April

2021. This was driven by the highly contagious

Delta variant of COVID-19. However, in contrast

to the nationwide lockdown that was implemented

during the first wave of the pandemic in March and

April 2020, the Government cautiously adopted

mobility restrictions during the third wave to

curb the spread of the virus, while facilitating the

continuity of economic activity in order to ensure

overall socioeconomic wellbeing. During the initial

stages of the third wave, all identified patients were

hospitalised or quarantined at designated centres,

while first contacts of patients were quarantined

either at quarantine centres or at their residences.

However, as the caseload rapidly increased, in an

attempt to prevent overcrowding, the Government

decided to hospitalise COVID-19 patients on

a priority basis. The marked rise observed in

fatality rates in August 2021 led the Government

to impose an islandwide curfew from 21 August

till end September 2021, during which essential

economic activities were allowed to continue. With

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

118

the vaccination drive that gained pace from end

July 2021 onwards, a steady decline in the caseload

was observed from mid September 2021 onwards

allowing for all mobility restrictions to be lifted with

effect from 01 October 2021. Subsequent to the

detection of the Omicron variant in early December

2021, there was a steady rise in cases to 66 cases

per one million population was observed in mid

February 2022. Despite this steady rise, with 65

per cent of the population having completed the

initial protocol of 2 vaccine doses and 28 per cent

of the population having received the booster dose,

the fatality rate declined to a relatively low level of

2 deaths per one million population compared to

10 deaths per one million population observed in

August 2021. Considering the rapid progress of

the vaccination drive, the Ministry of Health (MoH)

issued a circular in late January 2022 allowing

COVID-19 positive patients to be released from

isolation after 7 days from the date of the Rapid

Antigen Test or PCR positivity or from the date

of onset of symptoms. Further, fully vaccinated

close contacts without symptoms of COVID-19

were not required to be quarantined, while those

who were partially vaccinated or unvaccinated

could be released from quarantine after the

completion of a 7-day quarantine period. In early

2022, the vaccination programme was expanded

to encompass children above the age of 12 years

with those in the age group of 12 – 15 years being

provided with a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine.

In late January 2022, an Extraordinary Gazette

was issued preventing people from entering

public places without possession of proof of being

fully vaccinated against COVID-19 with effect

from 30 April 2022. The Government continued

to steadfastly allocate significant amounts as

pandemic related expenditure. Accordingly, all

related expenditure for the year amounted to

Rs. 165.6 billion. Of this, health sector related

expenditures, such as on vaccines, quarantine

facilities, health sector infrastructure and medical

supplies, stood at Rs. 130.1 billion.

Amid the challenges of the pandemic, Sri

Lanka continued to deal with the outbreaks of

other communicable diseases as well. In 2021,

a total of 23,853 Dengue cases were reported,

of which a significant share was reported in

December with the onset of the monsoonal rains.

Approximately 70 per cent of cases reported

were from the Colombo, Batticaloa, Gampaha,

Kalutara and Kurunegala districts. The upward

trend continued with over 8,000 Dengue cases

being identified during the first three months of

2022, raising concerns about the resurgence of

Dengue, especially after relatively fewer cases had

been reported in the corresponding period of 2021.

The improvement in case trends was driven by

the COVID-19 mobility restrictions which enabled

households to clean their surrounding vicinity and

keep premises free of mosquito breeding grounds.

Increased awareness among individuals about

personal hygiene, especially the increased use

of facemasks, led to the usual seasonal Influenza

pattern not being observed during the year. The

number of leptospirosis cases identified in 2021

stood at 6,855 cases compared to 8,579 cases

reported in 2020.

Despite the pressures exerted by the

COVID-19 pandemic on the health sector, the

Government remained committed to ensuring

continuity of medical care to those struggling

with Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)

and the segments of the population who need

targeted health care. Accordingly, the MoH

continued to coordinate with district level Medical

Officers to ensure the uninterrupted supply of

medicines and undertake the follow-up of patients.

As in 2020, the MoH delivered medicines through

health sector staff, non-health government officers

and via post. A web-based mechanism was also

established in collaboration with the Pharmacy

Owners’ Association to facilitate the convenient

purchase and delivery of medicines to homes.

Further, the MoH continued to engage in creating

awareness via mass media and social media

regarding the adoption of healthy lifestyle habits,

the management of NCDs, identification of early-

warning signs and ways and means to obtain

medical services in an emergency. The Family

Health Bureau also spearheaded a number of

initiatives fulfilling the health needs of the vulnerable

maternal and child segments during the pandemic

via provisioning of reproductive, maternal,

newborn, child, adolescent and youth health care,

especially to pregnant mothers and children who

tested positive for COVID-19. Sri Lanka was the

first country in South Asia to vaccinate pregnant

mothers in an attempt to minimise the impact of

the disease. With due consideration to Sri Lanka’s

struggle with the triple burden of malnutrition, i.e.,

under nutrition, overweightness or obesity and

micronutrient deficiencies, several district specific

targeted interventions were developed to overcome

these issues.

During the year, initiatives were underway

to improve the infrastructure base of the public

healthcare system. Accordingly, nine healthcare

institutions were upgraded and recategorised,

while the necessary approvals were granted for

the establishment of 27 new primary medical care

units. The project pertaining to the remodeling

and construction of additional buildings at the

New District General Hospital – Matara was

underway during the year and attained physical

progress of 90 per cent. In addition, expansion of

the physical infrastructure of the cancer treatment

unit at the Teaching Hospital in Karapitiya and the

strengthening and streamlining of the Accident and

Emergency Care units in 28 line ministry hospitals

were also in progress during the year.

Private sector healthcare services played

a pivotal role in alleviating the pressures on

the public health sector, especially those

stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Private

hospitals have been at the helm of providing

innovative services to meet the growing needs of

the population, particularly driven by the pandemic.

The wide availability of affordable telemedicine

services through private healthcare providers

allowed patients to receive evaluations, diagnoses

and treatments from medical professionals

using telecommunications technology. Private

hospitals also played a cornerstone role in curbing

COVID-19 outbreaks through the timely provision

of Intermediate Care Centres, in addition to

COVID-19 related testing services and treatments.

The expanded service provisioning by private

healthcare providers ensured that needy sectors of

the population and those who do not have access

to private health care were not crowded out of

public sector health care services. As at the end of

2021, the private health care system comprised 233

hospitals with a capacity of 5,444 beds.

Education

The Ministry of Education (MoE) was

engaged in uplifting the productive potential of

the human capital base of the economy, in line

with the vision of the Government towards the

creation of a productive citizenry and vibrant

human resource base. Accordingly, the MoE

developed a strategic plan for the period of 2021-

2025 in collaboration with the provincial education

authorities and national level education institutions,

pursuant to the principle of ‘learning for all’ in

primary and secondary stages of education. The

medium-term plan for the general education sector

was organised under the four key thrust areas

of strengthening equity in education, improving

quality of education, strengthening stewardship

and service delivery of general education as well as

enhancing evidence-based education policy making

and planning. Other initiatives, such as the New

National School Development Programme, were

also underway. This programme entails the upgrade

of 831 selected schools to the 'national school'

category in order to increase the number of national

schools islandwide to 1,204 schools. During the

year, Rs. 1.9 billion was allocated for this programme

and each of the selected schools received

Rs. 2.0 million for improvement and development

of physical and learning infrastructure. As the

first step, 09 schools were declared as national

schools in early 2021. With the intention of inducing

qualitative improvements to learning outcomes, the

National Institute of Education (NIE) developed a

new curriculum for Ordinary Level and Advanced

Level under the theme of ‘inquiry based learning’

with increased focus on active learning, while

teachers training modules and manuals for teachers

were also improved to facilitate the inquiry based

learning process. The programme to introduce

the 'Technology' stream as the fifth stream at the

Advanced Level continued to progress in 2021, with

09 schools being added to this programme resulting

in 466 schools providing the Technology stream

by end 2021. Meanwhile, the ‘13-years mandatory

education’ policy was further augmented during

the year with 523 schools island-wide offering the

‘Vocational’ stream for Advanced Level studies.

Notably, of the 9,603 students enrolled under the

Vocational stream, approximately 87 per cent were

identified as vulnerable to dropping out from the

education system, in the absence of this option.

During the year, about 11,000 students who had

been undertaking studies in this stream were directed

to institutional training. Further, 6,390 students

who were enrolled under this stream in previous

years completed Level 04 of National Vocational

Qualifications (NVQ) and were absorbed across

several industries such as tourism and hospitality,

automobile/electrical services, care giving/sports,

IT, construction and agriculture and plantation,

among others. Plans are underway to extend this

programme to another 78 schools during 2022.

Intermittent closures of physical schools

during the year warranted the adoption of

various novel methods to conduct general

education activities to overcome the challenges

of the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools remained

closed either partially or fully during the most part of

2021, with the brief exceptions of usual operations

during the month of March and the last quarter

of 2021. During these brief periods of opening, in

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

121

collaboration with the MoH, the MoE took several

measures to ensure the strict adherence to

COVID-19 related health guidelines by children,

teaching and non-teaching staff across the school

premises. Such measures included the regular

disinfection of classrooms, availability of hand

washing facilities, physically distanced classroom

arrangements and coordination of arrangements

for secure transportation of students. Towards the

latter part of the year, the MoE closely engaged

with health sector stakeholders to expedite the

process of vaccinating teachers, while extending

vaccine deployment to students above the age of

16 years. During periods of closure, for the second

consecutive year, the MoE strived to ensure the

continuity of education activities through hybrid

mechanisms. Continuation and further expansion

of the provision of online programmes that were

in place during 2020 was a key aspect of the

hybrid mechanisms. Accordingly, the national

e-learning management system e-Thaksalawa

was expanded with additional content spanning all

school grades, while the MoE continued to telecast

educational programmes in both the Sinhala and

Tamil languages under the Gurugedara educational

programme. During the year, measures were

taken to broadcast the audio of these educational

programmes through national radio channels to

enhance outreach. With due consideration to gaps

in technology and internet infrastructure, especially

in rural and estate areas, the Radio e-Thaksalawa

mobile application was developed during the year

to provide round-the-clock access to audio contents

of the Gurugedara programme. Meanwhile, over

2,000 Regional Distance Learning Education

Centres were established in remote areas to

facilitate students who were having difficulties in

accessing existing online learning facilities. During

the year, the MoE issued a new assessment tool

for evaluating children with special education

needs, thereby enabling the creation of Individual

Education Plans (IEPs) for such children, especially

considering their increased vulnerability to weaker

learning outcomes amid the dearth of face-to-face

interactions in learning environments. Although,

several national examinations were delayed due to

unforeseen circumstances caused by the COVID-19

pandemic, they were promptly rescheduled to take

place in 2022. Accordingly, the Grade 05 Scholarship

examination and the Advanced Level examination

which were to take place in August 2021 were

postponed and subsequently held in January 2022

and February 2022, respectively, while the Ordinary

Level examinations were postponed to May 2022.

Although the commitment of all relevant

stakeholders to ensure the continuity of general

education activities is highly commendable,

especially the rapid transition of such activities

to online platforms, it is important to duly

recognise that such activities were likely to

have exacerbated existing inequalities in

learning outcomes, largely driven by disparities

in access to technology-related infrastructure

facilities and relevant literacy levels. Further,

the quality of online learning outcomes needs to

be assessed as they are likely to be straddled by

issues caused by the lack of physical interactions

that are unique to those observed while engaging

with teachers and peers in classroom and laboratory

environments and in extracurricular activities. These

learning gaps are likely to have lingering effects

on learning outcomes which can translate into

significant gaps in skills, abilities and knowledge in

children. Relevant stakeholders should undertake

proactive assessments of potential learning losses

during the past two years and adopt focused and

targeted measures to fill these learning gaps with

the recent return of children to regular physical

school. It is also vital that the Government continues

to maintain the online education infrastructure base

that has been developed to address the needs of

3

the COVID-19 pandemic as such infrastructure can

contribute to the reduction of existing disparities in

the country’s existing education infrastructure base

through unhindered access and free availability of

these vital resources.

The Government continued to carry out

higher education activities through distance

learning platforms during 2021. During the year,

higher education activities at state universities

were conducted through the LEARN online

education system which was in place since March

2020. Under the LEARN platform, students and

academia were provided with free data and lectures

were delivered through online platforms. During

the year, at times there were as many as 250,000

attendees in a day, of which 100,000 participants

have been simultaneous users. Meanwhile, with

a view to ensuring the quality of online education

services, the University Grants Commission (UGC)

continued to review the progress of the LEARN

platform in collaboration with universities during the

period under review.

During the year, several initiatives

were in progress to expand the tertiary

education infrastructure base of the country.

Accordingly, two new universities, the Gampaha

Wickramarachchi University of Indigenous

Medicine, and the University of Vavuniya were

established during the year. The Gampaha

Wickramarachchi Ayurveda Institute was

upgraded as a fully-fledged university in March

2021, comprising 04 faculties with 13 academic

departments offering 08 undergraduate courses

and 08 postgraduate level courses. The Vavuniya

Campus of the University of Jaffna was upgraded

as the University of Vavuniya in August 2021 and is

expected to promote higher tertiary level education

in the areas of Business Studies, Applied Sciences

and Technology Studies. In addition, it has

been proposed to establish a National Nursing

University and a National University for Teachers

Training. During the academic year 2020/21, 16

new courses were introduced by the UGC, across

several universities.

The private sector also continued to

facilitate the expansion of opportunities in

the higher education sector of the country.

Accordingly, there were 21 Non-State Higher

Education Institutes (NSHEIs) recognised as

degree awarding institutes as at end 2021. During

the year, the number of accredited programmes

offered by NSHEIs increased to 190 from 167 in

2020, thereby providing increased opportunities

across different streams of study for students to

pursue higher education through the private sector.

Meanwhile, the MoE continued to work towards

developing a five-year re-review guideline, with

a view to ensuring the quality standards of these

NSHEIs, while initiatives regarding the introduction

of minimum standards for the institutional review and

programme review of NSHEIs were also underway.

The Technical and Vocational Education and

Training (TVET) sector continued to provide

education opportunities during 2021 aimed at

enhancing skill levels of the workforce in line

with the emerging needs of the economy. As at

end December 2021, there were 1,071 registered

institutions engaged in providing TVET education,

comprising the Government, private and non-

governmental institutions. Through this extensive

network of institutions, over 3,000 accredited

courses were conducted, while 45,033 NVQ

certificates were issued to qualifying students during

the period under review. Meanwhile, the Tertiary

and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC)

adopted measures to conduct NVQ programmes

via online platforms and television lesson series

while also developing an online system to collect

data on students’ training performance as well

as to evaluate programme applicants. The TVEC

developed new national standards for several NVQ

levels, while revising existing guidelines to ensure

the continued relevance of NVQ programmes.

Meanwhile, the Department of Technical Education

and Training (DTET) continued to upgrade

vocational training facilities across the island to

cater to the industrial demand for skilled labour.

Accordingly, several infrastructure enhancement

projects were carried out during the year under the

Tech Udana programme, while a new technical

college was established in Puttalam during the

year.

Housing and Urban Development

Amid several hindrances caused by the

COVID-19 pandemic, the Government continued

to initiate and implement several projects aimed

at enhancing housing facilities in the country.

Accordingly, a number of housing projects were

commenced in line with the Government’s National

Policy Framework with the objective of ensuring

comfortable and affordable housing facilities for all

Sri Lankans. In line with the Government’s vision,

the National Housing Development Authority

(NHDA) continued to implement the Obata Geyak

– Ratata Hetak programme to fulfil the housing

needs of low-income families who are unable to

build houses despite owning a land plot. Under

this programme, the NHDA is expected to build

at least one house in each Grama Niladhari

division. Accordingly, in 2021, the construction of

12,192 units was initiated, of which 4,075 units

were completed during the year. Further, the

Mihindu Niwahana housing programme for low-

income parents of ordained monks and Siyapatha

and Sapiri Mahal Niwasa housing programmes

to provide affordable housing for middle income

earners, were underway during the period under

review. The Urban Development Authority (UDA)

also continued its Middle Income Housing Project

and Affordable Housing Project to meet growing

housing needs in urban areas and their immediate

surroundings, while enabling improvements to the

living standards of the middle income population,

including government sector employees.

The UDA engaged in several projects during

the year with a focus on improving livability of

urban environments, while developing citizen-

centric townships. During the year, under the

Township Development Project of the UDA,

around 57 projects including the Boralesgamuwa

multipurpose building, Minuwangoda market, and

real time flood mitigation programme were carried

out. These projects comprise the development of

car parks, bus stands, public markets, multipurpose

buildings, and urban parks that were implemented

across all provinces in accordance with town

plans for urban development. The UDA launched

the Siyak Nagara (Hundred Cities) Beautification

Programme to redevelop regional town centres

into citizen-centric cities with improved livability.

Several other key projects, such as public

institution development projects, the Beira Lake

Rehabilitation and Redevelopment Project,

reconstruction of Jaffna Town Hall, and Maritime

City Development Project were also underway

during 2021, focusing on improving the aesthetics

and functionality of urban environments. In

addition, continued efforts were made to improve

urban transportation facilities to create an inclusive

transportation system in the Western region under

the Western Region Transport Development

Project. Accordingly, construction work on the

Metro Rail Transit System and the Multi-Modal

Transport Centres such as the Kadawatha and

Colombo-Fort transport hubs progressed in 2021.

Several investment projects, including the High-

rise Mixed Development at Galle Town Centre,

Theme Park Project at Gregory Lake, Hambantota

Logistics Hub and Multi-storied Car Park at BIA,

focused on attracting Foreign Direct Investments

(FDIs) are also currently in the pipeline and being

expedited under development clusters of the UDA.

The Government continued its efforts

to improve the efficiency of waste disposal

systems to build national capacity in relation

to integrated solid waste management. The

Metro Colombo Solid Waste Management Project

was initiated to provide a long-term sustainable

solid waste management system for urban areas.

The project was underway during the year with an

overall progress of 87 per cent by end 2021, and

is expected to be completed by mid-2022. Upon

completion, around 1,200 metric tons of waste per

day will be transported to the Aruwakkalu landfill

using existing railway lines. While concerns have

been raised by various stakeholders regarding the

environmental implications of the project, with the

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

125

right design and proper management, the sanitary

landfill is expected to provide a sustainable

solution for the growing waste disposal issue of

the country. Meanwhile, the Government took

initial steps to establish waste management parks

and small scale waste management centres,

while developing mechanical composting plants in

Homagama, Badulla and Jaffna over the next few

years.

Development activities in the Colombo Port

City project were continued in 2021 with a view

to building a leading financial centre and one of

the most modern and attractive cities in South

Asia. Following the completion of all reclamation

activities, the reclaimed area was designated as a

Special Economic Zone by the Colombo Port City

Economic Commission Act, No. 11 of 2021, which

was passed in May 2021. Activities related to

internal infrastructure development were underway

in 2021, attaining a cumulative progress of 67 per

cent in relation to infrastructure works and 52 per

cent in landscaping activities of Phase I, which

comprises the development of infrastructure,

as well as office and retail space and residential

units. Further, by end 2021, construction activities

pertaining to sewage and waste water disposal

infrastructure for the Colombo Port City were in

progress in line with the Metro Colombo Solid

Waste Management Project. The water supply

line from Maligakanda was completed, and the

Elie-house water supply line achieved progress

of 55 per cent at end 2021. Construction of main

road access connections from the mainland to

Colombo Port City is under progress. Of the key

access infrastructure, the Port Access Elevated

Highway that allows the access to Port City from

highway network achieved 35 per cent progress

by end 2021, while the Marine Drive Extension

Project, which provides access to the Port City

from the South of Colombo, was at its initial

stages. The Yacht Marina area was opened to the

public in January 2022, while Phase I is expected

to be completed by early 2023 with the expedited

completion of infrastructure developments.

Poverty Alleviation and Safety Nets

Sri Lanka’s commendable progress in

poverty alleviation is likely to have been

affected by the pandemic, along with a

widening of already prevalent inequalities.

Sri Lanka made significant strides in reducing

poverty over the past two and a half decades

as a result of the several multi-pronged poverty

alleviation efforts of consecutive governments

and their efforts to creating inclusive growth. As

per the official poverty line that was devised by the

Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) based

on the Household Income and Expenditure Survey

(HIES) 2002, the Poverty Head Count Index (PCHI)

had reduced from 28.8 per cent in 1995/1996 to

3.2 per cent in the 2019 survey round. With the

recent updating of the official poverty line using

HIES 2012/13 data, although the declining trend of

poverty is similar, the share of the population living

below the poverty line in 2019 stood at 14.3 per

cent. Accordingly, as per the updated poverty line,

approximately 3.04 million individuals live below

the poverty line which is almost 4.4 times more

than the number of people that were previously

estimated to be living below the 2002 poverty line.

The HIES-2019 also reveals that approximately

one in six Sri Lankans are multidimensionally poor

and experience deprivations across 42 per cent of

the weighted indicators. Accordingly, the national

multidimensional poverty head count ratios were

relatively high at 16.6 per cent in rural areas

and 51.3 per cent in estate areas. The people in

the estate sector experienced the highest level

of deprivation. Among the districts, the lowest

incidences of multidimensional poverty were in

Colombo (3.5 per cent) and Gampaha (5.1 per

cent), whereas the highest was in Nuwara Eliya

(44.2 per cent). Despite the substantial disparity

across the districts, the quantum of people who

are multidimensionally poor were higher in the

Colombo and Gampaha districts due to the higher

population density that is typical of urban areas.

This highlights the vulnerability of a significant

share of the population to poverty even prior to the

COVID-19 pandemic. With the prolonging of the

pandemic and the disruptions that it has entailed,

a ‘new poor’ segment of the population who remain

at the brink of poverty is likely to have emerged

in recent years. Duly considering the likelihood

of worsening poverty outcomes and disparities,

despite the limited fiscal space and challenging

economic circumstances, the Government and the

Central Bank consistently focused on cushioning

the adverse impacts of the pandemic on vulnerable

segments of the population via unprecedented

fiscal and monetary stimulus packages. While these

measures are likely to have dampened the impact of

the pandemic on the financial and nutritional status

of the population to some extent, other disparities

that were prevalent prior to the pandemic, such as

those in relation to access to health and education

infrastructure and the asset base of households,

could impede the contemporary and future

productive capacity of households. Going forward,

for the Government to undertake efficacious and

targeted policy initiatives to prevent any scarring

of households through the lingering impacts of

COVID-19 or similar unanticipated episodes, it

is vital that comprehensive and recent datasets

related to poverty are made available by respective

institutions in a timely manner.

The Government initiated several social

protection measures targeting vulnerable

groups of the population with a view to

alleviating the financial burden of the loss

of livelihoods stemming from the COVID-19

pandemic. For the second consecutive year, the

Government continued to expand existing social

assistance programmes with due consideration

to the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19

pandemic on needy segments of the society.

Accordingly, during the third wave of the pandemic,

the Government provided an allowance of Rs.

5,000 to vulnerable households in two rounds

during the months of April and June 2021. As such,

around Rs. 14.1 billion was distributed among

2.8 million eligible households in April 2021 followed

by a second round distribution of Rs. 8.2 billion

among 1.7 million families in June 2021. Many

households, including Samurdhi beneficiaries,

low-income and vulnerable families, the elderly,

disabled and kidney disease patients benefited

from this programme. In addition, in August 2021,

the Government also provided an allowance of Rs.

2,000 per family, targeting families who had lost

their livelihoods but were not receiving assistance

from any of the Government’s existing allowance

programmes. Accordingly, a total of Rs. 11.8 billion

had been distributed under this programme.

The Government also remained committed

to the continuation of all existing safety net

programmes during the year, in order to

preserve the economic wellbeing of vulnerable

segments of the population. During the year,

the Department of Samurdhi Development (DSD)

distributed Rs. 51.6 billion among 1.8 million

beneficiary families under the longstanding

Samurdhi Subsidy programme. The DSD also

carried out numerous programmes targeted

at livelihood, social and entrepreneurship

development with the intention of creating ‘safety

ropes’ that would enable households to lift

themselves out of poverty. The Government also

continued to provide the nutrition allowance of Rs.

20,000 for young mothers, while continuing the

Morning Meal programme for pre-school children

and the provisioning of ‘take home’ rations in lieu

of in-school meals under the National School

Meal programme. These programmes were

implemented by the State Ministry of Women

and Child Development, Pre-School and Primary

Education, School Infrastructure and Education

Services. These measures are expected to have

played a vital role in preserving the nutrition

status of young children and new mothers amid

the challenges faced by needy households. In

view of the disproportionately higher and far more

immediate impact of COVID-19 on the poor, the

programme was further augmented by the decision

to increase the Samurdhi subsidy amount by

around 28 per cent per beneficiary family from

February 2022 onwards, as proposed in the Budget

2022. Accordingly, the family unit allowances of

Rs. 3,500, Rs. 2,500 and Rs. 1,500 per family were

increased to Rs. 4,500, Rs. 3,200 and Rs. 1,900

per family, respectively.

While the prevalence of numerous safety

nets helped Sri Lanka to make significant

progress in poverty alleviation and is expected

to have dampened the impact of the COVID-19

pandemic on vulnerable segments of the

society, effective targeting of such measures

and development of new initiatives that are

not reliant on the government budget are

essential to ensure efficacious and sustainable

outcomes. In recent years, there have been

concerns that assistance programmes such as

Samurdhi have been less effective in poverty

alleviation due to poor targeting. Revisiting the

list of social assistance recipients to identify the

truly vulnerable, implementation of economic

empowerment programmes for the poor, and the

creation of an effective exit mechanism from social

assistance programmes within a reasonable time

span, are crucial for improved targeting of social

assistance programmes, while alleviating the

associated burden on the Government budget. In

this regard, expediting the establishment of a

regularly updated social registry is imperative

to improving the efficacy of such interventions.

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka’s rapid demographic transition

to an aging society highlights the importance of

retirement benefit schemes such as the government

pension and provident fund schemes, especially for

informal sector workers who are outside the ambit

of existing social security programmes. Although

only around 30 per cent of the population is being

currently covered by a formal pension scheme,

the current pension framework of the Government

is becoming an ever-growing fiscal burden on the

government budget amid the shrinking fiscal space.

Therefore, broadening the country’s social security

framework through the introduction of a nationwide

contributory pension scheme is essential to ensuring

a secure retirement for all in the coming decades

especially considering the growing life expectancy

of Sri Lankans and their evolving needs.

Environment

The Ministry of Environment was engaged in

several initiatives related to the strengthening of

the regulatory and policy framework pertaining

to the preservation of the natural resources of

the country. Key steps in creating a conducive

policy environment to mitigate environmental

issues and support sustainable development

were the preparation of the National Environment

Policy – 2022 and the National Environment Action

Plan 2021 – 2030. With the intention of providing

focused interventions in relation to environmentally

sensitive areas which are hotspots of biodiversity,

the draft of the National Policy on Environmental

Sensitive Areas in Sri Lanka was submitted to the

Cabinet of Ministers in November 2021, seeking their

approval. Currently, the National Climate Change

Policy of Sri Lanka, which was formulated in 2012, is

also being updated to include recent developments

in relation to climate change. During the year,

several other environmental programmes such as

the Surakimu Ganga programme to minimise the

pollution of river systems through multi-stakeholder

collaborations and the Husma Dena Thuru island-

wide national tree planting programme were also in

progress. A key commendable initiative undertaken

during the year was the gazetting and enforcement

of regulations banning single use plastic products

from 31 March 2021 onwards and the introduction

of a plastic category coding system. Another

key milestone during the year was the launch of

Sri Lanka’s first waste-to energy power plant in

Kerawalapitiya that is expected to generate 10

MW. Construction of another plant in Kotawila was

underway to generate electricity from biogas using

biodegradable waste. This is expected to add 400

KW to the natural grid. Such initiatives are essential

to solve Sri Lanka’s growing waste management

issues in a sustainable manner

The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) and

the National Building Research Organisation

(NBRO) continued to engage in several activities

to provide early warnings and to improve the

country’s disaster preparedness and disaster

responses. During the year, the DMC had issued

338 special weather warnings to enable the general

public, related disaster management authorities and

fisheries community to facilitate early preparedness

activities and to mitigate risks stemming from

natural disasters. In addition to charter activation

pertaining to the X-Press Pearl oil spill, the South-

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

129

West monsoon floods and Second Inter monsoon

floods, the DMC also worked to assess the X-Press

Pearl oil spill. The preparation of multi hazard risk

profiles for selected cities and work pertaining

to an all-island school disaster risk assessment

was also underway during the year. In 2021,

the NBRO was actively engaged in monitoring,

dissemination of early warnings for evacuation and

the implementation of corrective and preventive

mitigation measures in relation to landslides

and slope failures particularly in the Ratnapura,

Kegalle, Kalutara, Kandy and Kurunegala districts.

During the year, 6,763 Landslide Risk Assessment

Reports were issued by the NBRO after conducting

necessary investigations and analyses. Further,

under the Reduction of Landslide Vulnerability by

Mitigation Measures Project, the NBRO commenced

mitigation works across 24 sites and another 32

sites were undergoing the procurement process.

All mitigation work pertaining to the 147 sites that

had been earmarked as vulnerable to landslides is

expected to be completed by 2025.

increasing trend during 2021 with a notable rise in the latter part of the year. Global commodity price

hikes of both food and non-food items, higher freight charges, domestic supply side bottlenecks,

direct and indirect impacts from various price revisions and demand pressure instigated by successful control

of the COVID-19 pandemic made a considerable impact on domestic prices. Within the Food category,

a major contribution to the increase in the general price level was from the prices of items in the Volatile

Food category. Furthermore, prices of items in the Volatile Food category increased noticeably in the latter

part of 2021, mainly due to harvest reduction that arose with the shifting to organic farming practices and

higher festive demand due to normalisation of economic activities with the control of the pandemic. Further,

prices of food items excluding Volatile Food increased continuously during 2021. Prices of items in the

Non-Food category increased continuously during the period at a higher pace towards the end of the year,

yet generated a lesser impact on the general price level, compared to the Food category. Reflecting these

developments, the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI, 2013=100) followed an overall increasing trend

from 138.7 index points in January 2021 to 154.7 index points in December 2021, and the National Consumer

Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100), which recorded 142.1 index points in January 2021 increased to 161.0 index

points by December 2021. In terms of wages, nominal and real wages of both formal and informal private

sector increased in 2021 compared to 2020. Formal private sector wages increased with revisions made to

the minimum wages while the increase in informal private sector wages was attributed to higher demand

for labour with the normalisation of economic activities due to easing of COVID-19 related travel restrictions

and rise in cost of living. With regard to the public sector, the nominal wage rate index remained unchanged

during 2020 and 2021, while the real wage rate index decreased in 2021 compared to 2020.

4.2 Prices

Movements in the General Price Level

The general price level, as measured by both

Consumer Price Indices (CPIs), namely, the

CCPI and NCPI,1 moved in an overall increasing

trend during 2021, mostly attributable to

the increases in prices of items in the Food

category. During the year, prices of items in the

Food category demonstrated an overall increasing

trend. Meanwhile, prices of the items in the

Non-Food category, which generated a lesser

impact on the general price level compared to the Food

category also exhibited an overall increasing trend.

Accordingly, the general price level demonstrated a

continuous increase during 2021 except for March,

during which the Food category recorded a decline

owing to the favourable supply in the Maha season.

Moreover, global commodity price hikes, high

freight charges, production shortages, and logistical

bottlenecks made a considerable impact on the

general price level, including the indirect impacts

from various upward price revisions in items of both

Food and Non-Food categories, forcing the general

price level to increase at a considerable pace

towards the end of the year. The increased money

incomes of the people due to deficit financing by the

banking sector have also contributed to raise prices

of limited supply of goods and services. Moreover,

COVID-19 related subdued demand tapered off by

the end of the year and demand pressure impacted

on the general price level.

Prices of items in the Volatile Food2 category

increased during 2021 with a significant rise

during the last two months of the year. Moreover,

1 The Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), compiles official consumer price indices, namely, the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100) and the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI, 2013=100) on a monthly basis. The NCPI demonstrates the price movements of selected consumer items at the national level, while the CCPI reflects the same among urban households in the Colombo district.

2 Volatile Food includes rice, meat, fresh fish and seafood, coconut, fresh fruits, vegetables, potato, onions and selected condiments.

issues associated with attempts towards fully

shifting to organic farming practices such as limited

availability of organic fertiliser, absence of proper

guidance and instructions on organic farming,

higher prices of existing chemical fertiliser stocks,

destruction of cultivation and lower yield made a

significant upward pressure on prices of Volatile

Food items. In January and February 2021, prices

of volatile food items increased mainly due to

price increases observed in rice, coconut, green

chilli and vegetables. However, prices of items in

the Volatile Food category declined in March and

April 2021 owing to declines observed in the prices

of coconut, vegetables, onions, green chilli, and

potatoes. The observed downward trend saw a

reversal thereafter, with a noticeable increase in

June 2021, contributed by the price rises observed

in rice, vegetables and fresh fish, while continuing

the same trend in July 2021. The direction of the

Volatile Food category changed in August 2021

owing to the price decreases observed in rice,

coconut, and onions, while the price declines seen

in rice and vegetables mainly contributed to the

decline recorded in September 2021. Afterwards,

the increase observed in October 2021 was

attributable to price increases in rice, fruits, big

onion, and chicken. Further, increases recorded in

the Volatile Food category intensified in November

and December 2021, driven by price increases in

rice, vegetables, green chilli, chicken, fish, coconut,

potato, and onions along with higher consumer

demand due to the festive season. Rice prices

increased continuously during the period up to

July 2021, which included the months during which

the 2020/2021 Maha harvest reached the market.

However, in response to several measures taken

by the Government, rice prices declined in August

and September 2021. Furthermore, Maximum Retail

Prices (MRPs) of Samba, Nadu, Kekulu White, and

Kekulu Red, which remained unchanged for more

than a year, were revised upwards in September

2021, this gazette notification on MRPs was

rescinded in the same month in order to prevent a

rice shortage in the market. Meanwhile, the Special

Commodity Levy (SCL) on imported rice was revised

downwards at the beginning of November 2021 in

order to balance supply side issues. It was however

observed that prices of all local rice varieties rose at

a rapid pace with the removal of respective MRPs

in September 2021, further contributed by higher

festive demand during November and December

2021, especially due to normalisation of economic

activities with the successful control of the spread

of COVID-19. Vegetable prices demonstrated

mixed movements with the supply disruptions

instigated by travel restrictions imposed due to

the COVID-19 pandemic, limited trading activities

in major economic centers and adverse weather

conditions being the major influences, while the

prices escalated towards the last two months of the

year mainly owing to supply shortages instigated by

scarcities in fertilisers and pesticides and the high

festive demand. Coconut prices recorded an overall

decrease during 2021 allowing the Government

to rescind the gazette notification on MRP with

effect from 18 June 2021. However, coconut prices

exhibited an increasing trend during October to

December 2021, due to seasonal factors, higher

consumption during festive season and lower

coconut availability for domestic consumption due to

increased external demand for desiccated coconut.

The price of chicken increased considerably during

the year mainly due to rising cost of production that

resulted from elevated prices of poultry feed, such

as maize and antibiotics. Meanwhile, prices of

both large and small fish varieties increased during

2021. Further, prices of potatoes, of which the SCL

underwent several revisions, remained mostly at

stable levels during the first nine months of 2021

with a notable increase afterwards. Prices of red

onion demonstrated an overall decline during the

period, while prices of big onion mostly steadied

during the year owing to timely interventions made

by the Government, yet demonstrated a continuous

increasing trend towards the latter part of the year.

Meanwhile, gazette notifications that were issued

imposing price controls on imported potato and big

onion in the Volatile Food category were rescinded

with effect from 03 November 2021 with a view of

preventing essential food shortage in the market.

Prices of food items excluding Volatile

Food increased continuously during 2021.

Accordingly, dhal prices increased continuously

during the year remaining above the prices

observed in 2020, mainly due to price increases

in the global market and higher freight charges.

Sugar prices which increased in April 2021 due to

festive demand, increased thereafter with a peak

in August 2021 as a result of the acquisition of

Import Control License (ICL) to import sugar being

mandatory. Though the Government’s decision

was based on the knowledge that sufficient sugar

stocks were already available in the country,

private traders issued only a limited stocks to the

local market causing an upward price pressure.

Moreover, global sugar prices remained higher

in 2021 compared to 2020 due to drop in sugar

production and higher global demand. As a result,

MRPs were imposed on white sugar with effect

from 02 September 2021, with the view of reducing

sugar prices. However, MRPs imposed on sugar

were removed with effect from 03 November 2021,

as sugar prices followed an increasing trend from

mid-September 2021 onwards. Global milk powder

prices increased with the limited production caused

by unfavorable weather conditions in Australia and

New Zealand and increased global demand with

the normalisation of economic activities along with

gradual easing of COVID-19 related restrictions.

Consequently, the price of imported milk powder,

which remained unchanged throughout 2020,

experienced an upward price revision in October

2021 due to price increases in the global market,

higher freight charges and removal of price

controls. A subsequent price increase in local

milk powder also occurred with effect from

15 October 2021. Afterwards, imported milk

powder underwent another upward price revision

towards the end of 2021. Meanwhile, a gazette

notification was issued to maintain the SCL of

Rs. 100 per kg on dried fish with effect from

12 August 2021 to encourage local dried

fish producers. Moreover, wheat flour price

also underwent an upward price revision of

Rs. 10 per kg with effect from 10 October 2021,

resulting in an increase of Rs. 5 per 450g loaf of

bread with effect from 11 October 2021, in addition

to increases in prices of other bakery products

such as buns and cakes. Further, another upward

price revision was made on wheat flour causing a

consequent upward revision in 450g loaf of bread

by Rs. 10 with effect from 29 November 2021.

Later, it was announced that the price controls

imposed on all bakery products including bread

were removed with effect from 21 December 2021

with the intention of allowing their prices to be

determined by the respective input cost and other

market conditions. It is noteworthy that gazette

notifications that were issued imposing price

controls on several essential commodity items,

namely, white sugar, dhal, chicken, canned fish,

wheat flour, green gram, gram, dried fish, maize,

and imported milk powder were rescinded with

effect from 03 November 2021.

Prices of items in the Non-Food category

increased continuously during 2021 at a

higher pace towards the end of the year, albeit

generating a lesser impact on the general

price level compared to the Food category.

COVID-19 vaccination rates, relaxing pandemic

related restrictions and normalisation of economic

activities. This was reflected in the import price of

crude oil,3 which increased by 64.6% in December

2021 compared to December 2020. As a result,

domestic prices of petrol (92 octane), auto diesel,

and kerosene were increased twice in 2021

causing additional indirect price pressure on the

general price level. In addition, prices of vehicle

spare parts, vehicle servicing costs and taxi

fares increased during the year. Further, prices

of some prepared food items in the Restaurants

and Hotels subcategory recorded increases on

several occasions in 2021. This was partially

caused by the significant upward price revision in

a Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinder weighing

12.5kg with effect from 10 October 2021 by both

Litro Gas Lanka Ltd and Laugfs Gas PLC due

to rising global LPG prices. It is noteworthy that

LPG prices,4 i.e., Propane and Butane, increased

by 76.6% and 63.0% in December 2021,

respectively, in the global market, compared to

December 2020. In addition to revisions to LPG

prices, increased food prices also played a major

role in upward adjustments in domestic prices of

prepared food. The Education subcategory, which

remained at constant levels mostly during the

year, increased from September 2021 onwards

due to increases observed in international school

fees and tuition fees for secondary education.

Prices of private medical practices, payments

to private hospitals/medical laboratories and

medical/pharmacy products exhibited intermittent

revisions resulting in continuous increases in the

Health subcategory from April onwards. However,

the increase observed in housing rent in October

2021 was marginal compared to the observed

Non-Food categories contributed towards the

notable monthly increases observed during the

period from October to December 2021, with

a substantial share originating from the Food

category.

National Consumer Price Index

The NCPI, which recorded 142.1 index

points in January 2021, increased continuously

to 161.0 index points in December 2021,

except in March 2021, which recorded a

monthly decline. Movements in prices of the

Food category mainly contributed towards the

increase observed in the NCPI in January and

February 2021. This increasing trend reversed in

March 2021 solely due to price decreases of items

in the Food category. However, from April, when the

third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic surfaced, the

NCPI increased until December 2021 as a result of

the increases observed in prices of items in both

Food and Non-Food categories; yet the considerable

contributions were from the Food category except

for September and October 2021, with the major

influencer being the Non-Food category. While

supply shortages of food items raised their prices,

the increased money incomes of certain sectors of

the population also contributed to further increases

of those prices.

maintenance and equipment increased noticeably

from September 2021 onwards. Meanwhile,

prices of clothing and footwear, which remained

mostly at constant levels during 2020 increased

continuously in 2021 at a higher rate from October

onwards.

Consumer Price Indices

Colombo Consumer Price Index

The CCPI accelerated from 138.7 index

points in January 2021 to 154.7 index points

in December 2021. Monthly increases observed

in January and February 2021 were supported

by the movement of prices of items in both Food

and Non-Food categories. However, monthly

declines observed in the CCPI during March and

April 2021 were solely driven by the movement

of prices of the Food category. Afterwards, the

movement of prices of items in both Food and

Non-Food categories contributed towards the

increases observed in May and June 2021 with

a higher contribution from the Food category.

The increase in the CCPI observed in July 2021

Producer's Price Index (PPI)

The PPI as measured by the average prices

received by domestic producers of goods and

services in Agriculture, Manufacturing, and

Utilities sectors was rebased to 2018 Q4 from

2013 Q4 in November 2021 by its compiler,

the Department of Census and Statistics.

Accordingly, the weights and prices in the

rebased PPI were updated to reflect the current

economic trends. Further, several new items

were added, and some items were removed from

both Agriculture and Manufacturing sub-sectors,

in addition to expanding the geographical

coverage of the Manufacturing sub-sector.

The PPI (2018 Q4=100) exhibited an overall

increasing trend during 2021 from 116.0 index

points in January to 133.7 index points in December

2021. The PPI in the Agriculture sub-sector

recorded 134.0 index points in January 2021,

remained at comparatively stable levels and

increased continuously in the last five months of

the year, reaching 161.7 index points in December

2021. Meanwhile, the PPI in the Manufacturing

sub-sector reported 113.9 index points and 131.4

index points in January and December 2021,

respectively, recording monthly increases mostly

during the year. The PPI in the Utility (Electricity,

Gas, Steam and Air conditioning supply and Water

collection, treatment and supply) sub-sector, which

recorded 100.1 index points in January 2021,

recorded notable fluctuations during the first four

months and steadied afterwards throughout the

year reaching 102.5 index points in December

2021.

4.3 Wages

Real wages of employees in the formal

and informal private sectors showed

increases while the real wages of public

sector employees showed an erosion in

2021 compared to the previous year. Nominal

wages also showed an increase in terms of

employees in the private sector while it remained

unchanged for the employees in the public sector

during 2021 compared to the previous year. The

repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, such

as travel restrictions and contraction in economic

activities, negatively impacted the growth of

wages in 2021. On the other hand, normalisation

of economic activities with the successful

roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccination programme

and the decision to increase the minimum wages

of employees in the formal private sector had a

positive impact especially on formal and informal

private sector wages.

Private Sector Wages

Nominal wages of informal private sector

employees, as measured by the informal private

sector wage rate index (2012=100), followed

an overall increasing trend during 2021. The

nominal wage rate index recorded moderate

increases during 2021 except a slight decline in

April 2021 and sharp spikes recorded in both

September and October 2021. The decline in

April was due to the decrease observed in wages

of small industry activities whereas, the sharp

increases observed in September and October 2021

were driven by all sub-activities: agriculture,

industry, and services. With these developments,

the nominal wage rate index of the informal private

sector increased by 9.2% in 2021 compared to

2020. Meanwhile, nominal wages of agriculture

increased by 6.4%, industry increased by 9.7%, and

services increased by 10.0% in 2021 compared to

2020. Normalisation of economic activities with the

ease of COVID-19 related travel restrictions and the

nationwide vaccination programme paved the way

for the increase in informal sector wages. Moreover,

the increase in labour demand caused by the shift

4

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

140

of labour between industries as reflected by the

employment numbers, also caused some increases

in respective wages. Moreover, the rise in cost of

living also contributed to the increase in informal

sector wages, especially towards the latter part of

the year. Meanwhile, the real wage rate index of the

informal private sector increased by 2.0% in 2021

compared to 2020.

Nominal wages of employees in the formal

private sector,5 as measured by the minimum

wage rate index (1978 December=100) of

employees, whose wages are governed by

wage boards, increased significantly by 74.4%

in 2021 compared to 2020. This significant

increase was caused by the increase in the daily

wage of tea and rubber plantation workers to

Rs. 1,000 with effect from 05 March 2021, through

respective wage boards for the tea and rubber

growing and manufacturing trade. Further, the

5 Nominal wages of the formal private sector employees, whose wages are governed by the wage boards are measured by the minimum wage rate index (1978 December=100) compiled by the Department of Labour.

increase in the minimum monthly salary of the

private sector from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 12,500

and in the minimum daily wage from Rs. 400 to

Rs. 500, due to the amendment made to the

National Minimum Wage of Workers Act, No. 03

of 2016 with effect from 16 August 2021 also

contributed to this increase. Accordingly, the real

wage rate index of the formal private sector also

increased significantly by 64.3% in 2021 compared

to the previous year. Meanwhile, the tripartite

agreement on paying 50% of the last paid basic

salary or Rs. 14,500 per month, whichever was more

favourable to the employee, in situations where

employees were required to stay at home due to the

COVID-19 pandemic, was extended until December

2021 for the tourism sector.

Public Sector Wages

Nominal wages of public sector employees,

as measured by the public sector wage rate

index (2016=100), remained unchanged during

2021 compared to the previous year. On the

other hand, public sector employees experienced

a real wage erosion of 6.4% during 2021

compared to 2020. The upward revisions made to

the salary scales of Sri Lanka Principals’ Service,

Sri Lanka Teacher Advisors’ Service and

Sri Lanka Teachers’ Service to remove the salary

anomalies of the Teachers and Principals and

the special allowance of Rs. 5,000 as announced

by the Ministry of Finance, both effective from

January 2022, will have a positive impact in terms

of public sector wages.

5.1 OverviewS

ri Lanka’s external sector experienced heightened vulnerabilities in 2021 amidst persistently high

debt service obligations and a weakened balance of payments (BOP) position along with lacklustre

performance in the domestic foreign exchange market with continuous pressure on the external

value of the currency. Although a rebound and a steady growth were observed in exports, a much higher

import expenditure resulted in the trade deficit widening notably, weighing negatively on the external current

account. The expansion in the trade deficit was driven by the significant increase in imports, even in the

presence of selected import restrictions, which outpaced the growth of exports. The widening of the trade

deficit was more pronounced in the latter part of 2021 and in early 2022 due to the combined effect of a

sharp revival in imports due to the normalisation of economic activities as well as higher energy prices.

The performance of the services sector remained subdued in both 2020 and 2021 despite the healthy

growth in the computer services subsector, while the tourism sector only picked up towards the latter part

of 2021. The deficit in the primary income account reduced marginally in 2021 compared to the previous

year as interest and dividend payments were low during 2021. A slowdown in workers’ remittances was

observed during the second half of the year, resulting in a notable decline in the surplus of the secondary

income account. Consequently, the current account deficit widened significantly to 4.0 per cent of the Gross

Domestic Product (GDP) in 2021, compared to 1.5 per cent of GDP registered in 2020. The financial account

also recorded a subdued performance as foreign investments in the form of foreign direct investment

(FDI) remained subdued, while portfolio investments in the stock exchange and the government securities

market also continued to witness net outflows. Adding pressure on external accounts, foreign inflows to the

Government were limited to foreign project loans and grants as well as two foreign currency term financing

facilities. The Central Bank received foreign exchange flows on account of the new Special Drawing Rights

(SDR) allocation from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and international swap arrangements with the

Bangladesh Bank and the People’s Bank of China

(PBOC) in 2021 and Reserve Bank of India (RBI)

in early 2022. In view of mounting imbalances in

the external sector due to lack of foreign exchange

inflows, several measures were taken to improve

foreign currency liquidity in the domestic foreign

exchange market and to replenish international

reserves. The Central Bank imposed mandatory

conversion requirements on export proceeds and

directed banks to sell a part of the converted export

proceeds and workers’ remittances to the Central

Bank. The Central Bank and the Government also

implemented several measures to induce workers’

remittances during the year. At the same time,

taking into consideration the dearth of foreign

exchange liquidity in the market, the Central Bank

provided financing support for the importation of

essential goods, mainly fuel, LP gas and coal, as

a national priority in 2021 and 2022. Although the

exchange rate was broadly maintained at a stable

level during 2021 and in early 2022 to support the

recovery process of the economy, considering

the emerging difficulties in the external front, the

Central Bank allowed a measured adjustment

in the exchange rate since early March 2022.

However, the notable pressures witnessed in

the domestic foreign exchange market caused a

large overshooting. Consequently, the Sri Lanka

rupee which depreciated by 7.0 per cent in 2021,

depreciated significantly by 33.0 per cent by

end March 2022. Having identified the need for

implementing urgent measures to address the

current external sector crisis, and to complement

them with broader economic reforms aimed at

resolving persistent and long standing issues in

the economy, the Government and the Central

Bank initiated further measures in early 2022,

including the initiation of engagements with the

IMF and to manage the country's external debt in

a sustainable manner.

5.2 Current Account Balance

Despite the increase in the services account

balance and the decline in the primary income

account deficit, the external current account

deficit widened significantly in 2021 as a result

of the widened trade deficit and the decline in

the surplus in the secondary income account.

Higher import expenditure compared to export

earnings resulted in a widened trade deficit of

around US dollars 8.1 billion in 2021 as opposed

to the relatively lower trade deficit of US dollars 6.0

billion recorded in 2020. The surplus in the services

account increased due to higher inflows observed

on account of information technology led business

process outsourcing (IT/BPO) related services and

improvements in the transport sector. The tourism

sector also showed signs of revival during the latter

part of the year. The deficit in the primary income

account contracted with the decline in dividend

payments of Direct Investment Enterprises (DIEs)

and coupon payments on account of government

securities held by foreign investors despite the

increase recorded in reinvested earnings of DIEs.

In comparison to 2020, workers’ remittances

contracted notably during 2021, particularly

during the latter half of the year, possibly due to

a notable difference in exchange rate in the grey

market compared to the official rate that prevailed

at that time. As a result, the current account deficit

widened to US dollars 3.3 billion in 2021, compared to US dollars 1.2 billion recorded in 2020. Reflecting the expansion in the current account deficit and a moderate expansion in the output, the current account deficit as a percentage of GDP stood at 4.0

per cent in 2021, compared to 1.5 per cent in 2020.

5.2.1 Merchandise Trade Account

Trade Balance

The deficit in the trade account that

contracted during the last two years, widened

notably in 2021 as the steady increase in exports

was outpaced by the sharp increase in imports.

The deficit in the trade account widened to US

dollars 8,139 million in 2021 from US dollars 6,008

million in 2020. Contributing to the expansion in the

trade deficit, imports increased notably, primarily

driven by higher commodity prices, including prices

of fuel, increased demand for imported items

due to normalisation of economic activity, higher

import expenditure on account of medical and

pharmaceutical items such as vaccines, and the

relaxation of some of the restrictions on importation

of non-essential goods. As a percentage of GDP,

the trade deficit widened to 9.6 per cent in 2021,

compared to 7.4 per cent in 2020.

Export and Import Performance, Terms of Trade and Direction of Trade

Export Performance

Earnings from merchandise exports reached

US dollars 12,499 million in 2021, recording

the highest level of export earnings for a

year, exceeding the previously highest export

earnings of US dollars 11,940 million that was

recorded in 2019. Accordingly, export earnings

grew by 24.4 per cent compared to US dollars

10,047 million recorded during 2020. Indicating

the strong export performance, earnings from

exports continued to exceed US dollars 1.0 billion

consecutively every month from June 2021.

Further, the highest ever monthly export value of

US dollars 1,211 million was recorded in November

2021. The increase in export earnings during

2021 resulted from the broad-based increase in

earnings from most export categories. Special

policy attention received from the Government,

the Central Bank, and other relevant authorities,

particularly through the setting up of new follow

up mechanisms and granting incentives towards

export-oriented industries and industries affected

by the pandemic, recovery of domestic production

due to the rapid vaccination rollout, and the gradual

revival of both demand and supply market chains

with the normalisation of global markets were the

main drivers of higher export earnings. As evident

from the movements in the export volume and

unit value indices, the increase in export volumes

significantly contributed to the increase in export

earnings. As a percentage of GDP, export earnings

increased to 14.8 per cent in 2021 from 12.4 per

cent recorded in 2020.

Earnings from industrial exports increased

by 26.5 per cent to US dollars 9,702 million in 2021

compared to 2020, accounting approximately

78 per cent of the total exports. While the growth

within the industrial exports category was broad-

based, earnings from textiles and garments exports

recorded a growth of 22.9 per cent reaching US

dollars 5,435 million during 2021 and contributing

more than 40 per cent of the increase in the total

exports. Increases in earnings from all major export

destinations of garments led to this increase. Exports

of rubber products, led by solid tyres and household

rubber gloves, supported the rubber product sector

to record an improved performance while becoming

the third most prominent export sector of Sri Lanka,

which exceeded US dollars 1 billion after garments

and tea. Earnings from petroleum exports increased,

led by bunkering and aviation fuel exports, due to

the increase in average export prices despite the low

volume of supply. The increase in the food, beverages

and tobacco category was mainly driven by value

added coconut products, animal or vegetable fats

and oils, and crustaceans preparations (mainly

crabs). However, reflecting the weakened demand

for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) exported

by Sri Lanka, earnings from made up textile articles

(mainly facemasks) and plastic clothing articles

categorised under plastics and articles thereof

declined considerably during 2021.

With the improved performance of most of the

subcategories, agricultural exports recorded a

growth of 16.8 per cent in 2021 compared to

2020. Higher earnings from spices, tea, seafood

and coconut products mainly contributed to this

increase, while export earnings from vegetables

declined. Offsetting the decline in average export

prices, the increase in export volume of 7.7 per

cent led to the increase in earnings from tea

exports in 2021. The higher earnings recorded

by natural rubber, spices (mainly cinnamon and

nutmeg) and unmanufactured tobacco products

were driven by higher export prices, whereas both

higher prices and volumes led to the increase in

earnings from seafood, pepper and coconut (both

kernel and non-kernel products). Earnings from

minor agricultural products increased due to higher

export volumes of fruits, cereals and essential oil

exports. However, the lower export volumes led

to the weak performance of vegetable exports,

despite higher prices.

Earnings from mineral exports, which

account for less than 1 per cent of total exports,

improved by 77.3 per cent in 2021 compared

to the previous year. Titanium ores categorised

under ores, slag and ash primarily contributed to

this increase, while increases in natural graphite

and quartz led to the increase in earnings from

earths and stones and precious metals.

Import Performance

Amidst the continuation of certain import

restrictions, mainly on personal vehicle imports,

expenditure on imports increased considerably

by 28.5 per cent to US dollars 20,637 million

in 2021 compared to 2020. The increasing

demand for inputs with the resumption of domestic

economic activities, elevated price levels in global

commodity markets, including fuel prices, higher

reliance on refined petroleum due to intermittent

closures of the refinery, higher expenditure on

account of medical and pharmaceutical items such

as vaccines, and the relaxation of some import

restrictions mainly accounted for the increase in

imports despite extremely low imports of personal

motor vehicles. Import growth was broad-based

as observed in the increases in almost all major

categories of imports. As observed by movements

in import volume and unit value indices, in general,

import expenditure was influenced by both volume

and price increases, despite the effect of volume

and price changes varying across major categories

of imports. As a per cent of GDP, import expenditure

increased to 24.4 per cent in 2021, compared to

19.8 per cent in 2020.

Accounting for more than half of total import

expenditure, expenditure on intermediate

goods contributed largely to the increase in

imports during 2021. Expenditure on intermediate

goods imports increased by 35.6 per cent to US

dollars 12,309 million during the year. During 2021,

as the largest expenditure item of the country’s

import bill, fuel imports, on account of crude oil,

refined petroleum (including LP gas), and coal,

increased to US dollars 3,743 million compared to

US dollars 2,543 million in 2020. Notable increases

in average prices of all three subcategories, as

well as the increased import volumes of refined

petroleum, caused the fuel bill to rise, offsetting

the effect of low volumes of crude oil and coal

imports. Import expenditure on textiles and textile

articles, the second largest import item, surpassed

the US dollars 3 billion mark for the first time. This

was led by the increase in expenditure on fabrics

and yarn, which were utilised to meet the higher

demand for Sri Lankan garments from major export

destinations such as countries in the EU, the UK

and the USA. Imports of chemical products (mainly

carbon) surpassed US dollars 1 billion for the

first time, while other import categories including

base metals (mainly iron and steel), plastics and

articles in primary form, and natural and synthetic

rubber recorded high growth rates during the

year. However, the ban that prevailed during most

parts of 2021 on importing chemical fertiliser led

to lower expenditure on fertiliser (mainly urea),

while unmanufactured tobacco and mineral

products such as cement clinkers recorded lower

expenditure values in 2021 compared to 2020.

Expenditure on investment goods, which

accounted for around 22 per cent of total

import expenditure, increased by 25.2 per cent

to US dollars 4,463 million in 2021. Expenditure

on all import items categorised under machinery

and equipment increased in 2021 compared to

2020, except for the machinery and equipment

parts, while office machines (mainly computers),

5telecommunication devices (mainly transmission

apparatus) and medical and laboratory equipment

contributed the most to this increase. Imports

of building material and transport equipment

(including commercial use vehicles) also increased

despite the continuation of some import restriction

measures throughout 2021. The increase in the

building material category was driven by iron and

steel imports amidst the lower expenditure on

cement, while expenditure on agricultural tractors,

lorries and railway equipment led to the increase in

transport equipment imports.

Expenditure on non-food consumer goods

increased by 18.1 per cent to US dollars 2,182

million in 2021 compared to US dollars 1,847

million in 2020. The largest contribution to this

increase was from medical and pharmaceuticals,

particularly the vaccines imported under the

COVID-19 vaccination programme. Mobile

telephones, rubber tyres and televisions were

among the other categories that contributed to

the notable increase in the imports of non-food

consumer goods. However, with the continuation

of restrictions imposed by the Government and the

Central Bank since March 2020, the importation of

vehicles for personal use was at a very low level

during 2021 compared to 2019 and 2020.

Expenditure on food and beverages imports

increased by 7.2 per cent in 2021 compared

to 2020. Higher imports of coconut oil led the oils

and fats category to record the largest increase

in the food and beverages category, while the

importation of rice, mainly towards the end of the

year (about US dollars 63 million during the last

two months of 2021), caused the cereals and

milling industry products category to record a

considerable increase during 2021 compared to

2020. Dhal, sugar and fresh fruits were the other

major food items that recorded an increased import

expenditure in 2021. However, expenditure related

to seafood, beverages and dairy products declined

during 2021 driven by low import expenditure on

canned fish and sprats, alcoholic beverages and

milk powder, respectively. The rise in unit values

largely contributed to the significant increase in

import expenditure.

Terms of Trade

The terms of trade, which is the ratio of export

prices to import prices, deteriorated for Sri Lanka

in 2021. The export price index increased by 5.4

per cent to 92.4 index points, while the import price

index increased by a higher rate of 15.2 per cent to

94.9 index points. The increases in the price indices

of all major categories of exports contributed to the

increase in export prices while higher prices of the

importation of intermediate goods and consumer

goods mainly accounted for the increase in the

overall import price index. As such, the terms of trade

deteriorated by 8.6 per cent to 97.4 index points in

2021 indicating that the amount of imports can be

purchased from a unit of exports has declined, as the

import price index increased at a higher pace than the

export price index.

The expansion in trade volumes contributed

significantly to the increase in both export

earnings and import expenditure during 2021.

The export volume indices for all three main

categories of exports improved, while the import

volume indices for intermediate and investment

goods increased during the year. However, the

import volume index for consumer goods marginally

decreased in 2021.

Direction of Trade

Sri Lanka continued to have similar major

trading partners in 2021 compared to the

previous year. In value terms, India regained its

position as the main trading partner of Sri Lanka in

2021, followed by China and the USA, all of which

together contributed to around 42 per cent of total

trade (both exports and imports) of Sri Lanka. Total

trade with India and China exceeded US dollars 5

billion each, while trade with the USA exceeded

US dollars 3.5 billion. The UAE, the UK and

Germany were the other major trading partners,

accounting for more than US dollars 1 billion each

in 2021. As per the country wise trade balances

in 2021, notable trade surpluses were recorded

with Western countries such as the USA, the UK,

Germany, Netherlands, Italy and Belgium, while

significant trade deficits were recorded with Asian

countries such as China, India, the UAE, Malaysia,

and Singapore.

The USA and European countries remained

the major destinations for Sri Lankan exports

in 2021. The USA continued to be the single

largest buyer of Sri Lankan exports with more

than US dollars 3 billion worth of exports, which

accounted for 24.9 per cent of total exports,

followed by the UK (7.5 per cent), India (6.6 per

cent), Germany (6.1 per cent) and Italy (4.6 per

cent). In line with increased exports, earnings

from most destinations, including the top ten

export destinations of Sri Lanka, increased during

2021. Garments, rubber products, machinery

and mechanical appliances, and food, beverages

and tobacco were major products exported to the

USA. The USA continued to be the single largest

garment export destination for Sri Lanka with

a share of 42 per cent of total garment exports

in 2021. Exports to the UK were denominated

by garments, rubber products, made up textile

articles, food, beverages and tobacco, machinery

and mechanical appliance and seafood. Exports

to India included spices, animal fodder, textiles,

food, beverages and tobacco, wood and paper

products and minor agricultural products. The EU

as a region accounted for about 24 per cent of

total exports in 2021, including about 30 per cent

of total garment exports. Rubber products, food,

beverages and tobacco, tea, seafood, machinery

and mechanical appliances and coconut kernel

products were among the other major items

exported to the EU. In 2021, the Middle East and

the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)

led by Russia were the main export destinations

for tea, jointly contributing to about 58 per cent of

tea exports by Sri Lanka.

Asian countries continued to be the major

source of Sri Lankan imports in 2021. China

continued to be the largest source of imports for

the third consecutive year, recording more than

US dollars 4.7 billion of imports in 2021, with a

share of about 23 per cent of total imports. Import

expenditure from China increased by 33 per cent,

mainly due to higher imports of machinery and

equipment, textiles and textile articles, building

material, and medical and pharmaceuticals. India

and the UAE followed suit as the second and the

third largest import sourcing countries in 2021,

accounting for shares of about 22.4 per cent and

items from India increased by 50 per cent, due

to petroleum products, textiles and textile articles,

base metals, and wheat. Major imports from the

UAE were petroleum products, base metals and

building materials, which contributed to around

86 per cent of total imports from the UAE. As an

import source, Malaysia gained the fourth position

in 2021 due to increases in major import items

such as petroleum products, food preparations,

machinery and equipment, chemical products, and

oils and fats. The major imports from Singapore in

2021 consisted of petroleum products, chemical

products and machinery and equipment. As an

import source, Japan was positioned at the tenth

position in 2021 compared to the sixth position in

2020, mainly due to restrictions on vehicle imports

during the year.

External Trade Policies, Developments and Institutional Support

The revival of the merchandise trade sector

in 2021 was supported by the policy support

and the efforts of all the stakeholders of the

sector amidst the devastating impact of the

pandemic. The policy stimuli from the Government

and the Central Bank, together with improving

global economic conditions helped the export

sector rebound beyond pre-pandemic levels.

The Government’s efforts to support domestic

producers by developing import substitutes to

several agricultural and industrial products while

conducting aggressive export promotion and

maintaining low taxes continued throughout the

year. At the beginning of 2021, the Presidential

Task Force on Economic Revival and Poverty

Alleviation focused its attention on encouraging

export earnings and other non-debt inflows of

foreign exchange through combined efforts with

relevant stakeholders to align their activities in a

streamlined and targeted manner. Accordingly,

several subcommittees coordinated by the Central

Bank were initiated for each major sector such as

merchandise trade (textiles and garments, gem and

jewellery, rubber products, tea, coconut products,

fisheries, spices and minor agricultural export

crops), tourism earnings, workers’ remittances

and foreign investments. These subcommittees

attempted to achieve assigned targets while

engaging with relevant stakeholders to overcome

immediate issues and bottlenecks that hinder the

progress of each sector. At the same time, the

Ministry of Trade initiated formulating a National

Trade Policy to strengthen policy guidance on trade.

Meanwhile, the World Trade Organization (WTO)

estimates that the growth of world merchandise

trade volume rebounded by 9.8 per cent in 2021

(from a contraction of 5.0 per cent in 2020)

moderating to 3.0 per cent in 2022 while authorities

would need to focus on securing the export share in

international markets through appropriate policies

and support.

Several import restrictive measures were

relaxed during 2021. Import controls adopted by

the Government during the first half of 2020 due

to external sector pressures were gradually lifted

during 2021. A series of Extraordinary Gazettes

were issued in this regard by the Department of

Imports and Exports Control setting out directions

on import controls during 2020 and 2021, under the

guidance of the Tariff Determination Committee

appointed by His Excellency the President. These

restrictions were imposed temporarily, in order to

preserve foreign exchange, primarily on selected

non-essential and non-urgent import items with a

minimum expected impact on domestic industries

and consumers. However, since June 2021, these

import restrictions were significantly reduced,

although the Central Bank imposed a 100 per

cent cash margin deposit requirement against the

importation of selected non-essential/non-urgent

goods made under letters of credit and documents

against acceptance terms with Licensed

Commercial Banks and National Savings Bank for

a brief period during September 2021. In addition,

the importation of inorganic fertiliser was restricted

in May 2021 in line with the Government’s policy

move to transit to organic agriculture. However,

these measures were also relaxed by November

2021. Considering the continuous pressure on the

external sector, the Government imposed several

restrictions on selected non-urgent and non-

essential consumer items during March 2022 such

as import licenses requirements, while increasing

import duties.

Several measures were undertaken to

improve the institutional support to the

external sector during 2021 aiming to support

the recovery of the sector from the impact of

the pandemic. The Export Development Board

(EDB) continued with the implementation of the

National Export Strategy (NES) 2018-2022, while

recommencing the promotional activities. The NES

Action Plan was continuously implemented in the

areas of market development, product and supply

chain development and capacity building. While

continuing web based promotional activities, the

EDB recommenced participation in physical trade

fairs, business-to-business promotion programmes,

and brand promotion campaigns, which were

mostly limited to the virtual mode during 2020.

Trade chambers also contributed towards export

promotion, helping to link-up the public and private

sector stakeholders in policymaking and grievance

handling. The Sri Lanka Standards Institution

(SLSI) continued the process of formulation and

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

upgrading of national standards, which helped

local manufacturers compete with foreign products.

Accordingly, to improve national standards to be in

line with international standards, the SLSI revised

128 standards out of 327 published standards by end

2021. Amidst the challenging market environment,

the Sri Lanka Export Credit Insurance Corporation

(SLECIC) reported about Rs.48.7 billion worth

of insured businesses recording an increase

of Rs.11.6 billion over the previous year. The

modernisation programme for Sri Lanka Customs

(SLC) continued under ten subcommittees that

analysed operational and management processes

and provided recommendations on required

reforms. Meanwhile, a Presidential Commission

of Inquiry was appointed in February 2021 to

investigate and report on matters related to the SLC

with a view to improving processes and preventing

revenue leakages. The SLC streamlined its

activities further, in relation to the implementation

of the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) of the

WTO.

Sri Lanka’s exports under trade agreements

improved in 2021 in line with the increase in

overall earnings from exports. During the period

under review, trade with the main trading partners,

namely, the EU and the USA under Generalized

System of Preferences (GSP) schemes, paved the

way for increased market opportunities. Sri Lanka

is expected to benefit from the current EU GSP+

scheme until its validity period ends in 2023 as

established following Sri Lanka’s reclassification

as a lower middle income country in July 2020.

The US GSP scheme expired on 31 December

2020 and is expected to be reauthorised on a

retroactive basis as per the general practice of the

US Government. The UK’s Global Tariffs (UKGT),

which is a different tariff system from that of the EU,

came into effect on 01 January 2021 and Sri Lanka

as an EU GSP+ beneficiary, continued to enjoy

the same duty free access to the UK. However,

the UK is expected to implement a new GSP

scheme from 2022 onwards and the Department of

Commerce of Sri Lanka has provided the required

inputs to the relevant authorities in the UK. The

GSP scheme offered by Japan, which expired on

31 March 2021, was extended for a period of 10

years until 2031. In addition, Sri Lanka continued to

benefit from GSP schemes offered by several other

countries, such as the Russian Federation, Turkey,

Australia, Canada, Switzerland, Norway and New

Zealand, although their contribution to exports

remained relatively low. Under bilateral Free Trade

Agreements (FTAs), the Indo-Sri Lanka Free Trade

Agreement (ISFTA) and the Pakistan Sri Lanka Free

Trade Agreement (PSFTA) continued to benefit Sri

Lanka, contributing to an increase in exports under

FTAs in 2021. Exports through FTAs with India and

Pakistan remained high around 65 per cent of total

exports to these countries in 2021. Meanwhile, the

share of imports under the ISFTA and the PSFTA

was below 5 per cent (US dollars 209 million) and

3 per cent (US dollars 12 million), respectively,

of total imports from India and Pakistan. Under

regional trade agreements, exports under the Asia

Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA) (due to higher

exports to China, South Korea and Bangladesh)

and Global System of Trade Preferences (GSTP)

(due to higher cinnamon exports to Mexico)

improved during 2021. Mongolia joined as the

seventh member of the APTA in September

2020, and other Participating States, including Sri

Lanka, exchanged tariff concessions reciprocally

with Mongolia with effect from 01 January 2021.

Exports under the SAARC Preferential Trading

Arrangement (SAPTA) continued to remain at low

levels while exports under the South Asian Free

Trade Area (SAFTA) improved during 2021. Sri

Lanka’s multilateral trade engagement with the WTO

continued in 2021. Work is underway to negotiate

and enter into preferential trade agreements with

trade partners with future potential, such as China,

Japan, Indonesia and Bangladesh, and the review

process of the Singapore-Sri Lanka FTA continued

during 2021. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka could also

seek the possibility of joining other regional trade

agreements such as the Regional Comprehensive

Economic Partnership (RCEP) to expand and

diversify the export market.

5.2.2 Services Account

The surplus in the services account recorded

a notable increase in 2021 compared to the

previous year, but remained lower than the

pre-pandemic and pre-Easter Sunday attacks

levels. This was mainly due to the healthy

growth in earnings from computer services,

gradual improvement in earnings from tourism

and improvements in freight related to sea and

air transport services. As a result, the surplus in

the services account amounted to US dollars 1.6

billion in 2021 compared to US dollars 0.8 billion

in 2020.

Travel and Tourism

The tourism industry, which was severely

affected by the COVID-19 pandemic,

witnessed a steady recovery in the latter

part of 2021 aided by effective measures

taken by relevant authorities along with the

improved global perception of Sri Lanka as

a safe travel destination. Since the reopening

to foreign travellers in January 2021, Sri Lanka

saw a steady increase in international travellers,

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

156

despite intermittent lockdowns. This enabled the

tourism sector to implement and improve its health

and safety protocols, which have proven to be

effective. Following the temporary restrictions in

April 2021, due to the emergence of the third wave

of the pandemic, Sri Lanka was reopened in June

2021 for fully vaccinated travellers with quarantine

free entry. As a result of these measures along

with the successful domestic vaccination rollout,

international tourist arrivals started to pick

up steadily from September 2021 to peak in

December 2021 with 89,506 arrivals. In support

of the recovery of the tourism sector, authorities

implemented several measures such as revising

codes of conduct, which specified health and

safety regulations for all tourist enterprises and

tourist services and upgrading the health and

safety guidelines. The tourism sector was also

provided with extended moratorium on its debt

payable to the financial sector until such time

they are able to recover from the set-backs they

experienced since 2019. Tourist arrivals declined

by 61.7 per cent to 194,495 in 2021 compared to

507,704 in 2020, of which 507,311 arrivals were

recorded during the first three months of 2020.

The steady increase in tourist arrivals continued

during early 2022 despite the disruptions to global

tourism caused by geo-political tensions.

Europe was the dominant region for

tourist arrivals, while India continued to

be the dominant single country for tourist

arrivals. About 93,496 arrivals were recorded

from Europe, accounting for 48 per cent of total

tourist arrivals. The Asia Pacific region recorded

the second highest arrivals in 2021 with 83,926

tourists, accounting for 43.2 per cent of total

tourist arrivals, despite the very low number of

travellers from China. In terms of tourist arrivals

by individual countries, India maintained its lead

with 56,268 arrivals during 2021 followed by

Russia, the UK, Germany, and Pakistan. In late

August 2021, Sri Lanka resumed its tourism

campaign in India, opening its borders to fully

vaccinated travellers. Russia surpassed the UK

as the second largest tourist destination in 2021

due to tourism promotion programmes carried out

targeting charter flights from Russia, suggesting

that enhanced connectivity through regular routes

and seasonal charter flight operations could be

promoted as a means to attract tourists from both

traditional and non-traditional markets. In 2021,

the top five tourist source destinations accounted

for 56.4 per cent of total tourist arrivals in Sri

Lanka.

While there was an increase in both average

spending per tourist and the duration of stay,

earnings from tourism was moderate in 2021

compared to the previous year as a result

of reduced tourist arrivals. As per the revised

estimates on tourist spending and duration of stay

for 2021 by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development

Authority (SLTDA), the average spending per

tourist in 2021 rose to US dollars 172.6 per day

from US dollars 158.1 per day in 2020. Further, the

average duration of stay by a tourist was estimated

to be at 15.1 days in 2021, in comparison to 8.5

days in 2020, reflecting the impact of quarantine

due to COVID-19 restrictions. Earnings from

tourism decreased by 25.7 per cent to US dollars

507 million in 2021, in comparison to US dollars 682

million in 2020. Meanwhile, limited outflows related

to travel were also recorded in 2021 compared to

2020.

Investment in the tourism sector expanded

further in 2021, indicating the continuous

confidence of investors in Sri Lanka’s tourism

potential. The Investor Relations Unit (IRU) of the

SLTDA received 45 new investment projects related

to the tourism sector amounting to US dollars 134

million in 2021, with a collective capacity of 1,328

rooms. Meanwhile, IRU granted approvals for 30

tourism related projects during 2021 amounting to

US dollars 104 million, with a collective capacity

of 922 rooms. In addition, 87 hotel projects with

6,265 rooms are currently under construction at

various levels. Accordingly, graded establishments

amounting to 480 with a total capacity of 25,958

rooms and supplementary establishments,

including boutique villas, bungalows, guest houses,

heritage bungalows, heritage homes, home

stay units, rented apartments and rented homes

amounting to 3,177 with a total capacity of 21,379

rooms were in operation in 2021.

The Government and the private sector

jointly implemented several policy initiatives

and various promotional programmes to attract

tourists in 2021. The debt moratoria in relation

to the tourism sector granted by Licensed Banks,

Licensed Finance Companies and Specialised

Leasing Companies at the request of the Central

Bank in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,

was in place until 31 March 2021, and further

extended until 01 October 2021. However, in view

of the lasting adverse effects of the pandemic on

the industry, the Central Bank extended the debt

moratoria again for another nine months ending in

July 2022. In line with this extension, moratoria on

lease rentals of business and private sector vehicles

providing passenger transport services to the

tourism sector were also extended. Furthermore,

the Saubagya COVID-19 Renaissance Facility

implemented by the Central Bank to provide loans

at concessionary interest rates to individuals and

businesses in the tourism sector, was extended

several times, until 30 June 2022 on a case by case

basis. In addition, several measures were taken by

the tourism authorities to reduce the burden faced

by stakeholders of the industry, such as extending

the validity period of licenses of all tourism

establishments registered with the SLTDA and

extending the validity of tourist guide licenses until

31 December 2021. The SLTDA, in collaboration

with the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel

Management (SLITHM) introduced an e-learning

platform for continuous professional development

to all registered guides to improve their knowledge

and skills. Further, the SLTDA launched a

membership drive to encourage informal sector

tourism operators to register with the SLTDA. All

informal tourism businesses, including tourist

hotels, guest houses, homestays, bungalows,

travel agencies, tourist-friendly eating places,

restaurants, and spa and wellness centres are

allowed to register through a provisional registration

Introduction

Tourism is defined as “a social, cultural and economic phenomenon which entails the movement of people to countries or places outside their usual environment for personal or business/professional purposes” by the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO). International Tourism (hereinafter referred to as “Tourism”) is basically exportation of services. Tourism earnings and expenditure are recorded as “Travel” under “Services” in the Goods and Services Account of the Balance of Payment (Balance of Payment and International Investment Position Manual - BPM 6 of the International Monetary Fund). Tourism remains an important source of net foreign currency earnings for a country, as the foreign currency outflows on account of inputs are minimal. In addition to earning foreign currency, the tourism industry also contributes to economic growth, employment, and reduction in regional income disparity. Sri Lanka’s strategic location, attractive natural endowments, cultural diversity, and rich history, together with the peaceful, clean, safe and foreigner-friendly environment, provide the basis for this industry to flourish. Therefore, development of the tourism industry will be a key economic priority, particularly in the post-pandemic economic recovery period, to mitigate external sector imbalances in the country.

Significance of Earnings from Tourism for the Economy at Present

Tourism remained the third largest source of foreign currency earnings between 2014 and 2019 and contributed to about 14 per cent of total foreign currency earnings during this period. Although export earnings, which is the largest source of foreign currency earnings, grew from US dollars 8,626 million in 2010 to US dollars 12,499 million in 2021, generation of earnings through such exports needed a considerable amount of import expenditure on account of inputs. However, tourism as a single industry has been able to generate substantial earnings with a relatively low reliance on imports of inputs. For instance, in the peak year of tourism in Sri Lanka, i.e., 2018, earnings from tourism, estimated at US dollars 4,381 million, outnumbered net export earnings of the apparel industry, that is, export earnings net of import expenditure on textiles (US dollars 2,459 million), and export earnings by other key industries such as tea (US dollars 1,428 million) and rubber products (US dollars 875 million). Meanwhile, workers’ remittances, which have been the second largest source of foreign currency earnings, brought an average of US dollars 7,023 million per annum between 2014 and 2019 despite falling to US dollars 5,491 million in 2021. Therefore, tourism is an important source of foreign currency earnings to Sri Lanka and has a key role to play in maintaining the country’s resilience to external sector pressures.

BOX 5The Role of Tourism during Post-Pandemic Recovery in Sri Lanka

Potential of the Tourism Industry

The global tourism industry recorded a steady growth in the recent decades despite setbacks suffered from time to time due to occurrences such as the global financial crisis and outbreaks of epidemics. Tourist arrivals reached 1,468 million by 2019 according to UNWTO. Sri Lanka too saw a continuous increase in tourism arrivals in the past until 2018, with a substantial increase from 2010 when the civil war ended. In fact, in 2018, Sri Lanka was named the top destination for the year 2019 by the acclaimed tourism information provider “Lonely Planet.” However, unfortunately, tourism arrivals in 2019 saw a set back because of the terrorist attacks on Easter Sunday in April 2019, though global tourist arrivals reached the record highest in that year. Despite this setback, tourist arrivals and earnings showed a recovery by end of 2019 and early 2020, before starting to decline again because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile the global tourism industry is expected to record a slow recovery in the forthcoming years. According to a survey conducted by UNWTO in January 2022 among its panel of tourism experts, 63 per cent of respondents expected that international tourist arrivals in their countries will not recover to the 2019 level until 2024, while 79 per cent of the respondents believed that arrivals in the Asia Pacific region will not recover to 2019 levels until 2024. However, UNWTO, World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) and market analysts have shown that there is substantial pent-up savings and a yearning to travel among potential travellers, while tourism characteristics have fundamentally changed because of the pandemic. Therefore, there is a potential for Sri Lanka to attract a substantial number of tourists and/or generate substantial foreign currency earnings from tourism even in 2022 and 2023, if appropriate strategies are implemented efficiently and effectively.

Pandemic and Tourism Response in the Era of “New Normal”

Recognising the importance of supporting the tourism industry, the Government and the Central Bank provided a multitude of relief measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as debt moratoria, concessionary loan schemes, waivers on fees, relief on electricity bills, one-off grants and tax relief measures. Meanwhile, rules were issued by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in January 2022 requiring hotel service providers to accept payments from non-residents only in foreign currency, which will ensure the inflow of foreign currency to the country on account of tourism. This also allows the tourism sector to strengthen its earnings in foreign currency without major capital investments, as the sector has made heavy investments in local and foreign currency. Meanwhile, some small-scale hotels kept afloat by renting hotels as quarantine centres when the industry as a whole suffered a significant setback due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

159

WTTC has highlighted several new features of the "new normal” or the current trends in global tourism, which should be adapted to (Trending in Travel – Emerging Consumer Trends in Travel & Tourism in 2021 and beyond, November 2021). For example, travellers are skeptic of booking well in advance owing to the sudden changes in restrictions imposed by countries and risks from testing positive for COVID-19. Further, travellers prefer accommodation and transport options that allow sudden cancellations without a penalty. Secondly, due to the normalisation of remote working through the pandemic, concepts such as “digital nomads” and “staycations” have become popular, and travellers seek long duration visa, long duration discounts at places of accommodation, fast internet, and other work-related facilities. International tourism organisations further note that the length of stay and spending on a trip increased in 2021. Thirdly, the profile of travellers has changed with more younger travellers (in their 20s to 40s) opting to travel, rather than older persons or families with small children due to health concerns. Therefore, the tourism industry and the country as a whole should be able to accommodate the needs and preferences of such tourists. This age group values adventure and individualism and they use mobile phones and digital services to plan and book their trips and rely on social media, blogs and online reviews of other travellers. Fourthly, appreciation of the value of mental health and personal wellness has increased notably in the recent past and consumer interest in achieving these needs through travelling has also increased. There is also an interest for “philantourism” where tourists can get involved in philanthropical activities and “ecotourism” to gain knowledge about ecological centres around the world. Fifth, the tendency to go on secondary trips, exploring lesser-known attractions near places of main tourism interests and rural tourism has also increased.

Sri Lankan Tourism: The Way Forward

The Ministry of Tourism and institutions under its purview together with the private sector keep strategising and implementing a plethora of measures to develop tourism infrastructure in the country and promote Sri Lanka in target markets. The tourism strategic action plan 2022-2025 developed by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) provides effective guidance for implementation of actions to upgrade the sector and resolve issues. A comprehensive tourism policy has also been drafted by the Ministry of Tourism and the Cabinet approval is awaited. However, there are certain aspects that require emphasis in policy development and implementation of strategies:

(i) Exploring new drivers of tourism

Sri Lanka has the potential to expand and enhance services in new areas of tourism such as wellness tourism, educational tourism and philanthropical tourism. In the sphere of wellness tourism, opportunities targeted at providing facilities to improve physical and mental well-being, such as peaceful and relaxing stays, retreats, meditation, yoga and Ayurvedic treatments could be expanded. Under educational tourism, short-term or long-term educational programmes in the areas such

as English and South Asian culture and civilisation can be offered at existing or new educational institutions. It is common for East Asians to undertake English Language programmes abroad after graduating from school and such programmes can be offered in Sri Lanka. Exchange programmes and home-stay programmes for foreign students can be encouraged as well. Philanthropical tourism can provide opportunities for foreigners to engage in philanthropical activities such as charity work and agricultural work in the country.

(ii) Greater importance of preserving and protecting the natural environment and pollution reduction.

There is a strong and growing interest towards conservation of nature and eco-friendliness among world travellers as given in various UNWTO and WTTC publications as well as communications from the Sri Lankan hotel sector. Sri Lankan authorities have a greater role in ensuring that construction of places of tourist accommodation does not destroy nature or scenic views for others (such as hotels at the edge of beaches) and does not result in encroachment of forests and other protected areas hidden from the public eye. Further, noise pollution near attractions and places of accommodation should be managed. Supervising practices that tourism service providers are engaged in are environmentally friendly (for example, whale watching tours disturbing whales) is also important. Also, the recently enacted Animal Welfare Act should be made of use to reduce the negative publicity that was created due to the treatment of elephants and wild animals, leopards in particular.

(iii) Focus on the individual tourist’s journey

SLTDA conducts a survey among departing tourists mostly on a yearly basis. In the 2018-2019 survey report, it is stated that only 17 per cent of tourists used package-tours showing that tourists plan their own trips to a great extent. Further, 60 per cent of surveyed tourists had obtained travel information from friends and relatives and 30 per cent from online sources, highlighting the importance of personal recommendations and personal online reviews. These findings underscore the importance of satisfying each individual tourist and the impact individuals can make on publicity. Further, the general satisfaction level is moderate, since only 60 per cent of the tourists stated that their stay was “excellent” and only 36 per cent of the tourists stated that they want to visit Sri Lanka again. Even the seemingly minute inconveniences to tourists can destroy their entire experience and ignite negative publicity affecting the whole tourism industry.

(iv) Greater use of digital technology

There is scope to enhance the use of digital technologies to improve tourist experience and transition from high-density to socially-distanced tourism. Although some steps have been taken in this direction such as the SLTDA website and the tourism mobile app (being developed), enhanced measures to use digital technology are necessary, expeditiously. UNWTO and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in “COVID-19 and the future of tourism in the Asia and Pacific” (March 2022) also point out the expanding role of digital technology in tourism.

In Sri Lanka, tourism is concentrated in the Western, Southern, and Central Provinces and the Sigiriya region. Crowding in National Parks have gathered considerable negative publicity lately. Meanwhile, even the ancient cities of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa do not attract a significant number of tourists (Table 86 of the Statistical Appendix). Other areas of the country provide ideal locations to conduct wellness, rural, philanthropical, adventure tourism etc. and tourists should be directed to attractions in these areas. Meanwhile, tourists are compelled to go through inconveniences such as buying tickets at individual tourism sites and not having updated information online about events (such as “Peraharas” and festivals, even the small-scale ones), public transport, security services, dress code at religious sites, prohibited items in national parks, etc. Therefore, incorporation of such information and the facility to purchase customised ticket bundles as per individual preference to the mobile app being developed or to a website dedicated to tourists will be highly beneficial. Digital technologies can also be used to provide touchless service delivery methods, QR Code based contactless payment options and to store and share health and safety information.

(v) Improving information to exploit the potential of tourism for better policy making

Appropriate policy decision making rests on a sound information network. Given the intense competition among countries to attract tourists and the evolving nature of tourist characteristics, use of a strong information network for policy decisions is pivotal. The “Tourism Satellite Accounting” initiative that the Department of Census and Statistics is implementing with the support of UNWTO will enable better estimation of the economic contribution of tourism to National Accounts. Hence, its implementation needs to be fast tracked. In addition, high frequency data on a multitude of other aspects is necessary, such as characteristics of persons arriving under tourist visas, how much they are spending and for what and where, satisfaction level, employment in tourism, number and types of direct and indirect tourism service providers and various spatial information. The need for national tourism authorities to enhance their market research capabilities to improve the customer journey, trigger innovation and offer insights to the private sector has been highlighted in multi-country studies conducted during the pandemic by the International Monetary Fund as well. (Tourism in the Post-Pandemic World: Economic Challenges and Opportunities for Asia-Pacific and the Western Hemisphere, International Monetary Fund, 2021).

(vi) Improving risk management capabilities of the tourism sector

Since tourism is inherently an industry that is highly susceptible to geo-political events and is seasonal, the sector should enhance its own risk management capabilities rather than relying solely on concessions such as debt moratoria and fiscal handouts. Debt moratoria reduce incomes of banks, affect their liquidity, and increase risks. An adverse outcome on the banking sector can have ripple effects on the entire economy.

(vii) Reducing informal sub-sector within the sector

The tourism sector in Sri Lanka is characterised by a large number of Micro, Small and Medium scale enterprises (MSMEs), carrying out their businesses informally. However, encouraging such enterprises to register with authorities will help to ensure that strategies the Government is implementing are streamlined and relief measures, if needed, are provided equitably to all participants. Also, high informality in an industry constrains information collection for policy decision-making purposes, delivery of Government services and regulation for quality standards. Registration of businesses will improve access to finance and tax collection as well.

(viii) Encourage diversity among tourists

Facilities should be aimed at satisfying diverse types of travellers in terms of their interest, country of origin and spending capacity, rather than targeting high net worth individuals only. This will help to reduce reliance on travellers with specific characteristics or from a single country/region. In fact, all types of travellers contribute towards positive marketing of Sri Lanka. Catering to tourists of different spending capacities will enable local entities with different investment capabilities to function in the industry as well.

(ix) Reducing over-reliance on tourism

The International Monetary Fund (IMF), in “Tourism in the Post-Pandemic World - Economic Challenges and Opportunities for Asia-Pacific and the Western Hemisphere” (2021), notes that countries that are dependent on tourism are in fact small in size, have inadequate foreign exchange revenue and buffers, limited fiscal space and other macroeconomic vulnerabilities. Incidentally, over-reliance on tourism is a feature of countries that have been less successful in other exports and are suffering from such features. Such tourism-dependent countries have a relatively low level of export complexity that affects their options for new product development. Development of new products requires the expansion of the productive knowledge and capacities. Tourism is not an industry that enhances the technological capacity of a country and is highly vulnerable to external shocks. In the aforementioned publication, the IMF shows the prudence of tourism-dependent countries (which includes Sri Lanka) to nurture other goods and services export sectors using new digital economy tools or focus on overall export development. As suggested in this report, in the medium-term, Sri Lanka should re-think its tourism model and undertake necessary structural reforms.

Conclusion

It is expected that the tourism sector will provide an impetus for post-pandemic recovery of the Sri Lankan economy despite the impact of geo-political tensions and the challenging domestic socio-political environment. Concerted efforts by the Government and the private sector to create, and not just adapt to, a new normal would be necessary. In this endeavour, travel advisories issued by some governments based

on the recent economic situation of Sri Lanka have to be countered by Sri Lankan authorities through better engagement. The recovery in the industry will depend on how well it will cater to the needs of the modern traveller, preparedness to possible supply and energy shortages, and sound management of finances in post-moratorium stages. From a marketing perspective, there is further potential for attracting tourists for diversified interests such as meditation and younger groups for medical and historical research. Both SLTDA and private tour operators need to encourage these specific groups of tourists to visit Sri Lanka offering attractive packages compared to peers in the region. With the waning of the pandemic, it is expected that the tourism sector could play a significant role in the economic revival of Sri Lanka.

process. Meanwhile, several strategic efforts were

taken to promote the country to attract a worldwide

audience, focusing on novel areas. In this regard,

the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTPB)

launched a five-year global communication

campaign in March 2021 and initiated the promotion

of film tourism for Indian cinema in October 2021.

Moreover, the World Expo 2020, which was held

from 1 October 2021 until 31 March 2022 in Dubai,

provided an opportunity for Sri Lanka to promote

trade, investment, and tourism. In 2021, several

new themes were added to Sri Lanka tourism for

the first time, such as the digital nomads initiative

and the digital program 'Go on a Couch Safari' that

livestreamed wildlife in Sri Lanka to enhance online

engagement. Aggressive tourism promotions led

Sri Lanka to achieve several accolades from world

renowned tourism organisations as one of the best

destinations to travel during 2021 by Condé Nast,

Travel and Leisure magazine, CNN travel, etc. and

it ranked as a top destination for wellness tourism

and ranked second in Women Solo Travel Index.

Transport, Telecommunications, Computer and Information Services and Other Services

The IT/BPO sector performed well during

2021 surpassing the US dollar 1 billion mark.

Freight transport services recorded a positive

growth in 2021 after significant disruptions

to sea freight transport services in 2020 due

to the pandemic. Although ship traffic to the

country’s ports declined marginally in 2021,

there was a notable increase in total container

handling including domestic container handling,

transshipments and restowing operations. Total

cargo handled in terms of cargo loaded and cargo

discharged also increased during the year. This

was coupled with higher global cargo handling

rates, resulting in higher freight related charges for

both imports and exports of the country. Meanwhile,

there was a notable reduction in earnings from air

passenger services due to the decline in tourist

arrivals with the pandemic. Passenger services

outflows also reduced as a result of constrained

travel opportunities for Sri Lankans to travel in

non-resident airlines owing to the pandemic. Other

services subsectors, including financial services,

construction services, government services and

other business services recorded modest net

outflows in 2021. Accordingly, the surplus in the

services account increased to US dollars 1.6 billion

in 2021, compared to US dollars 0.8 billion in 2020.

However, the surplus levels in the services account

in 2020 and 2021 were significantly low compared to

pre-Easter Sunday attacks level, mainly due to lower

earnings from tourism.

5.2.3 Primary Income

The primary income account deficit

recorded a contraction in 2021, as a result of the

reduced interest payments on foreign loans,

coupon payments on account of investments

in government securities and dividend

payments of DIEs, despite an increase in

reinvested earnings of DIEs. Interest payments

on foreign loans of the Government, private

sector and the state owned business enterprises

(SOBEs) declined during the year, while interest

payments by deposit taking corporations to non-

residents recorded a modest increase during the

year. A decline in interest payments of foreign

loans of the Government was observed, with

the Government gradually moving to low cost

concessional funding, while some short term

commercial loans were gradually being paid off.

Further, there was a significant decline in coupon

payments of international sovereign bonds (ISBs)

to non-residents due to the change in a part of the

ownership of ISBs from non-residents to residents

as well as due to the maturity of ISBs in 2020

and 2021, with no new issuances. However, an

increase in reinvested earnings was observed in

2021 compared to 2020. Meanwhile, inflows to the

primary income account declined, primarily due

to the decrease in investment income on account

of international reserves in 2021. With these

developments, the deficit in the primary income

account is estimated to be US dollars 2.0 billion in

2021, compared to US dollars 2.2 billion in 2020.

5.2.4 Secondary Income

The secondary income account weakened

as a result of the moderation in workers’

remittances in 2021. Workers’ remittances, which

recorded a healthy growth in the first five months of

2021 recorded a gradual decline from June 2021

onwards. This resulted in a decline of workers’

remittances of 22.7 per cent in 2021 compared

to a growth of 5.8 per cent recorded in 2020. The

decline could primarily be attributed to the reduction

in remittances received through official channels

due to the notable difference in the exchange rate

which prevailed in the grey market compared to the

official rate. With these developments, net inflows

to the secondary income account decreased to US

dollars 5.2 billion in 2021 compared to US dollars 6.2

billion in 2020. A notable recovery in remittances is

expected in 2022 with the sharp depreciation in the

exchange rate since March 2022, together with the

increasing number of migrant workers leaving for

foreign employment. In order to facilitate workers’

remittances through the banking sector, the Central

Bank established a new department named the

‘Foreign Remittances Facilitation Department’ while

also introducing a number of incentive schemes

for workers remitting money through the banking

sector. Further, a mobile application to facilitate

the convenient transfer of remittances named

‘Lanka Remit’ was launched by LankaClear with the

participation of most Licensed Commercial Banks

(LCBs). A temporary monetary incentive above the

official exchange rate was provided for remittances

converted into rupees while several other incentive

schemes are in the pipeline to be introduced to

promote workers’ remittances focusing on improved

welfare of migrant workers and their families.

5.3 Capital Account Balance

Net inflows to the capital account remained

broadly unchanged in 2021. Capital transfers to

the Government reduced, while those to the private

sector recorded an increase in 2021, compared

to the previous year. Consequently, the capital

account recorded a surplus of US dollars 25 million

in 2021 compared to a surplus of US dollars 28

million recorded in 2020.

Introduction

Efficient and safe movement of funds within a country and across the borders is an important component of the financial system of a country. This is more important for cross border transfers where foreign exchange is involved. Usually, a vast majority of these transactions occur through formal channels. However, in any economy, in varying sizes, there exist informal money transfer channels mainly for cross border transactions. The extent of informal channels and the use of formal channels by money remitters depends on the characteristics of a particular economy and financial market and the legitimacy of such transactions. Formal channels consist of the services provided by licensed and regulated entities such as financial institutions. Informal channels consist of participants of the unregulated markets such as Hawala, Hundi or Undiyal (in South Asia), Fei Qian or Chit (in South East Asia) and Black-market Peso (in European countries) service providers who have not been licensed to perform money remittance services in several countries. However, at present, certain countries with informal money transfer channels such as Germany, United Kingdom and United States of America pursue regulatory approaches in registration and licensing such service providers along with imposing anti-money laundering requirements. Hawala channels have been continuously used in moving the value of money from one place to another, without the physical movement of funds, since ancient times, when there were no formal banking channels. However, such informal channels still exist today, even though banking transactions have been made ultra-easy, as convenient as effecting by using a mobile app. These informal remitting services are used for legitimate as well as illegitimate purposes by various individuals, groups and entities. Such services are heavily exploited for criminal activities, even including laundering of money and financing of terrorism. For instance, Hawala channels were used to finance the activities that led to the deadly terrorist attack on the US World Trade Centre in 2001. Some favourable characteristics such as low cost of transactions, easy access, less paperwork, and quick transfers make these channels popular among remitters. However, being an informal business with the involvement of possible criminal activities, the possibility of losing money makes them a risky channel. Most importantly, these channels are highly vulnerable to misuse by money launderers and terrorist financiers. These types of informal and illegitimate payment channels could be detrimental to the smooth functioning of financial systems and economic activity of a country, as they move economic resources from the formal sector to the informal sector of an economy. This article intends to shed light on the adverse impacts of informal money remittance channels on financial systems and the economy of a country. Since all these informal remittance channels have more or less the same characteristics, the article will focus on the mainly used channel in Sri Lanka, namely Hawala,

BOX 6The Impact of Informal Money Transfers on Financial Markets and the Economy

and refer to it as Hawala channels or informal channels alternatively.

Introduction to Hawala Transactions

These remitting channels work as network arrangements and can be sometimes found within a particular community in the society. In these arrangements, the value transfers are facilitated by agents belonging to these networks who are located all over the world. In the Hawala channels, the Hawala agents or dealers (also known as Hawala Dars) live in different countries and settlements of transactions occur completely based on trust. An agent in one country collects money from people who need to send money to another country and the agent in that particular country settles those amounts to the intended recipients in the currency they desire. Accordingly, there is no physical cash movement across the borders, no financial institutions are involved in cross border transactions, and no transactions are properly recorded under these channels. However, financial institutions may be involved in the event domestic fund transfers are required.

Users of Hawala Channels

Hawala is used for both legitimate as well as illegitimate purposes by different economic agents. These include, a) foreign workers remitting money for families in their native countries, b) traders paying funds for goods imported and receiving funds for goods exported, c) parents transferring funds for their children’s foreign education, d) people who live in areas with less developed banking channels that provide remittance services, e) migrants without proper visa remitting funds and, f) illegitimate users such as money launderers and terrorist financiers.

Main Features of Hawala Channels

Hawala and informal channels have special features, which make these remitting channels attractive for users. Some of those features are as follows. Accessibility: informal channels have subtly penetrated every corner of the world and made their way into most economic activities including remote areas where formal banking facilities are limited or not available. Affordability: charges associated with fund remittances through formal banking channels are expensive when compared to the commissions involved in Hawala. Also, usually, the exchange rate offered by Hawala agents is more attractive than that of authorised dealers in foreign exchange. Speed: there are no cross border movements of currency in these informal channels and the amount equivalent to the foreign currency value is locally settled either by depositing funds to an account of the recipient or by settling in cash. In some instances, the recipients receive the money within a couple of hours and some have the option to receive money to their doorstep upon revealing the password to the respective Hawala agent. Convenience: these informal arrangements are

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

164

convenient from the remitter’s perspective as in countries where there are many expatriate Sri Lankan workers, such as Kuwait, South Korea and the Maldives, these agents possess mechanisms to collect salaries from the workers at the work premises itself, for the purpose of sending it to their families. Possible anonymity: this is the most appealing feature of Hawala. No paper or documentary proof is required for these arrangements. Hence, it is an indirect invitation for people who need to maintain secrecy in their transactions. Further, the legitimacy of the source of funds is not questioned by service providers since these agents are not subject to any regulatory supervision. In general, the more exchange and monetary restrictions and controls, the higher would be Hawala and Undial activities as customers in the formal sector also tend to patronize these services.

Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Through Hawala Channels

Informal money remitting channels provide a convenient platform for illegal money transfers through money laundering and terrorist financing activities. Money laundering is simply the conversion of money generated from illicit crimes into legally accepted money. The process of money laundering involves the following three steps. The first step is the placement where proceeds of the illicit crime are placed in the financial channel, i.e., in bank accounts. The second step is layering, which involves a series of transactions involved to conceal the origin of the proceeds of the illicit crime. The final step is integration where proceeds of the illicit crime are absorbed into the economy. Terrorist financing is the act of funding terrorist activities and/or organisations. The source of financing terrorism can be legal or illegal. Continuous inflows to backup terrorist activities are a must to continue the agendas of terrorist groups. Hence, different avenues are misused by terrorists for their funding needs.

There are several ways in which Hawala channels support money laundering and terrorist financing. The absence of a regulatory framework to control and identify any drawbacks and negative consequences of these channels is one of the key factors making them vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing. The absence of proper record retention procedures by these agents is another supportive factor. Compared to the banking sector, the lack of attention to the source and use of funds during these transactions also encourage money launderers and terrorist financiers. The difficulty to initiate legal proceedings is another notable feature.

Risks of Using Informal Channels

Many innocent people get caught in law enforcement investigations as a result of their choice to use Hawala channels to transfer funds arising from otherwise lawful and legitimate transactions. Hawala does not often utilise any sort of negotiable instrument or wire transfer. Instead, transfers of money take place based on communications between members of Hawala dealers. Hence, there is no way to prove the transaction and there is a high possibility of losing all the hard earned money that needs to be transferred. Sometimes Hawala dealers are directly or indirectly involved in criminal activities

such as fraud and drug trafficking to balance books. Hence, there is a high possibility of law enforcement agencies investigating Hawala dealers. In such an instance, people who innocently or unknowingly use Hawala channels may also be inquired by authorities.

Impact of Hawala on Financial Markets, the Economy and the Country

Informal cross border transactions could have negative impacts on financial markets, the economy and the national security of a country. Following are some of the main areas that could have an impact by having sizeable informal cross border channels:

Lower Tax Income

Hawala channels allow individuals or entities to transfer money through informal channels, thus facilitating tax evasion. The government incurs losses from direct taxes in the form of income, taxes as well as indirect taxes related to such transactions. Since the transactions carried out through Hawala channels are not being recorded, and due to the unavailability of such information to the local tax authorities, the income of the parties involved in the transactions along with the income of Hawala agents are excluded from the tax income of a country. Further, indirect taxes relating to transactions carried out through formal systems, such as registration fees and other service taxes are avoided, thereby negatively affecting government income. Hawala transactions are also used by importers and exporters of a country for the purpose of avoiding taxation on goods. For example, an importer could request the overseas exporter to underquote the invoices thereby reducing the tax to be paid to the government by the importer. The difference between the actual cost and the invoiced cost could then be settled through Hawala channels, which would be unnoticed by the tax authorities.

Impact on Balance of Payments (BOP) and Foreign Reserves of a Country

Workers’ remittances have become a significant component in foreign inflows and the balance of payments in emerging economies like Sri Lanka. When workers remit foreign earnings through informal channels such as Hawala, such earnings are not reflected in the calculation of BOP. This is relevant to several other components reported in BOP, such as merchandise trade. Accordingly, BOP statistics will not reflect the true position of the external sector of a country. Further, since foreign reserves of a country are accumulated through the transfer of funds via formal channels, Hawala transfers will not help in building up foreign reserves of a country, in fact, it could deplete reserves due to the possible switch between formal and informal channels.

Impact on Money Supply

The direct effect on broad money of an economy is almost zero for Hawala transactions as there is no physical movement of cash. However, the composition of broad money of the recipient country can be affected by Hawala transactions due to the cash centric nature

Recent Actions Taken against the Hawala Channels

Efforts to contain the expansion of Hawala channels in the island were strengthened in 2021, in view of the severe threats they pose to the economy, as discussed earlier. Public awareness sessions, including newspaper advertisements and articles, to increase the level of understanding of the public on the risk of Hawala type transactions, were conducted. Funds of accounts involved in such transactions were seized until investigations into their possible connections with unlawful activities are concluded. Further, financial incentives such as offering extra rupees to encourage foreign workers to remit their earnings through formal channels such as banks and other financial institutions were introduced. Moreover, other incentives such as retirement benefits and loan facilities for foreign remitters were also proposed with a view to promoting formal remittance channels and discouraging the use of informal channels.

Way Forward

The existence of Hawala channels poses a great risk to the global economy and the threat of vast expansion of these channels has been addressed by different countries by employing varied tactics. In India, Hawala transactions are restricted by prohibiting the making of any payment to any person outside India without conditional approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In addition, the RBI has implemented actions to enhance the quality of formal financial services such as establishing branches of commercial banks in rural areas to access the formal financial sector and permitted the non-bank financial sector to access Money Transfer Service Schemes to contain the impact of Hawala channels. Subsequently, the Indian Government enacted The Financial Exchange Management Act in the 1970s. Pakistan took steps towards the transformation of money changers to foreign exchange companies in which they were given a two year period to register and comply. The publication made by the Financial Action Task Force titled The Role of Hawala and other Similar Service Providers in ML/TF in 2013, clearly explains strategies to identify unregulated Hawala and other similar service providers and possible avenues to create incentives to formalise their business. At present, authorities plan to pursue steps to implement an appropriate legal framework to monitor and legalise Hawala channels in Sri Lanka.

of the transactions as there could be a decline in bank deposit accounts (savings and time deposits) in favor of cash transactions. The negative impact of Hawala channels on the banking sector and the development of a cash economy which could create instability of demand for money would limit financial intermediation and affect monetary transmission mechanisms causing inefficiency in monetary policy.

Impact on Financial Intermediation

The leakage of money from the banking system could constrain the availability of banking resources. It could also cause an increase in market interest rates when banks attempt to attract deposits by offering higher interest rates. Further, the essential functions of financial intermediation are threatened by alternative informal money transfer channels. Banks may also lose their market share due to an increase in the Hawala network.

Impact on National Security

The existence of informal channels is a challenge for national security agencies since several large terrorist attacks in the world have been partially funded by such channels. Hawala is a form of underground banking method, which is considered a threat to the effectiveness of the fight against terrorist financing since certain sources of terrorist financing are channeled through informal mechanisms. Accordingly, every effort should be made to stop expanding these channels and to stop terrorists using Hawala channels.

Sri Lanka and Hawala Channels

The Growth of Informal Money Transfer Channels

It has been observed that workers’ remittances in Sri Lanka fell notably in 2021 mainly due to fewer worker departures for foreign countries during the pandemic and the expansion of Hawala channels due to large exchange rate differentials between the formal market and the grey market. Migrant workers have been incentivised to switch to Hawala channels by the premium paid on the foreign exchange conversion rate by Hawala agents. The drastic drop in workers’ remittances in 2021 negatively affected the BOP position in Sri Lanka. It has been reported that Sri Lankan importers too use Hawala channels to pay their import bills because of the shortage of foreign currency supply in formal channels arising from exchange rate differentials even though the use of Hawala channels to obtain foreign currency is expensive. Overall, the popularity of Hawala channels in recent times has deprived the country from receiving crucial flows of foreign currency through formal channels, thus dampening the supply of foreign exchange, and shrinking foreign currency reserves creating BOP concerns. Thus, the expansion of Hawala channels poses a significant threat to the BOP position in Sri Lanka. However, if formal channels can continuously maintain a competitive exchange rate based on market demand and supply, the demand for informal remittance channels is expected to be contained, as the exchange rate differential is expected to reduce substantially.

5.4 Financial Account

In the financial account of the BOP, the net

incurrence of liabilities increased while the net

acquisition of assets recorded a significant

reduction during 2021. The net incurrence of

liabilities recorded an increase of US dollars 1.9

billion in 2021 compared to a reduction of US

dollars 1.7 billion in 2020. Reflecting the continued

uncertainty driven by the COVID-19 pandemic as well

as domestic circumstances, FDIs including foreign

loans to DIEs remained modest in 2021, similar to

the previous year. As a result, FDIs, including foreign

loans to DIEs, amounted to US dollars 784 million

in 2021, in comparison to US dollars 670 million

in 2020. Further, FDIs, excluding foreign loans to

DIEs, amounted to US dollars 598 million in 2021,

in comparison to US dollars 434 million recorded

in 2020. On a sector wise basis, major FDIs were

received by projects related to telecommunications,

property development, textiles and hotels sectors,

while such FDIs were primarily received by already

established DIEs. Despite the moderation in FDIs

in 2021, going forward, FDIs are anticipated to

materialise particularly to the Colombo Port City and

the Hambantota port project. Further, efforts are also

underway to monetise underutilised assets under

the Urban Development Authority, which will also

contribute to the FDI flows to the country.

The main financial inflows to the Government

during 2021 included the receipt of two foreign

currency term financing facilities from the China

Development Bank (CDB) in April and September

2021 totalling around US dollars 810 million. In

addition, investments in the form of debt securities,

which mainly consist of foreign investments in ISBs

and rupee denominated government securities,

recorded a net outflow of US dollars 670 million in

2021. This was due to the net impact of the maturity

of an ISB of US dollars 1.0 billion in July 2021, of

which, US dollars 700 million was owed to non-

residents, net sales of foreign investment in the

rupee denominated government securities market

and net purchases related to Sri Lanka’s ISBs made

by non-residents from the secondary market during

the year. The Central Bank received a quantum of

inflows, including the receipt of the SDR allocation

from the IMF in August 2021 (around US dollars 787

million), and the proceeds from the bilateral currency

swap facility with the Bangladesh Bank in August and

September 2021 (US dollars 200 million). Further,

the Central Bank entered into a bilateral swap facility

equivalent to approximately US dollars 1.5 billion

with the PBOC in March 2021, which was activated

in December 2021. Further, during the year, the

Central Bank settled a swap facility with the RBI

amounting to US dollars 400 million that was obtained

in 2020. Meanwhile, financial inflows to the private

sector remained modest in 2021. As such, portfolio

investments in the form of equity, which consist of

foreign residents’ investments in the Colombo Stock

Exchange (CSE), other than direct investment

transactions, recorded a net outflow of US dollars

236 million in 2021, compared to a net outflow of

US dollars 217 million in 2020. Further, foreign loan

inflows to the private sector and SOBEs also recorded

a modest net outflow in 2021. Meanwhile, in terms of

foreign inflows to the banking sector, currency and

deposits recorded a significant net increase, while

there was notable net settlements of short term

foreign loan liabilities of the banking sector. The net

incurrence of liabilities of trade credit and advances

declined, primarily due to net settlements of oil bills

by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation as a result of

lower demand for fuel during the pandemic periods.

Further, other accounts payable, mainly consisting of

Asian Clearing Union (ACU) liabilities managed by

the Central Bank, recorded a net increase in 2021.

Net acquisition of financial assets recorded

a significant reduction, reflecting the decline in

gross official reserves in 2021. Net acquisition of

financial assets declined by US dollars 2.1 billion in

2021, mainly due to the reduction in foreign assets of

the Central Bank. Gross official reserves declined by

US dollars 2.5 billion during the year due to sizeable

foreign debt service payments of the Government,

honouring of maturing liabilities of the Central Bank

as well as the significant supply of foreign exchange

by the Central Bank to facilitate imports of essential

items including fuel, LP gas, coal, medicine and

essential food items, particularly during the latter

part of 2021. However, net acquisition of assets in

the form of currency and deposits of deposit taking

corporations and the net acquisition of assets on

trade credit and advances, which represents trade

credit and advances given by Sri Lankan exporters

to their overseas trading partners, increased during

the year while other accounts receivable of LCBs

recorded a net decrease during the year.

5.5 Overall Balance

The overall balance of the BOP, which

represents the change in net international

reserves, continued to record a significant

deficit in 2021. Gross official reserves declined

notably in 2021, due to the continued moderation of

inflows to the financial account, substantial external

debt service payments and net sales to the domestic

foreign exchange market by the Central Bank during

the year. Consequently, net international reserves

recorded a deficit by end 2021, resulting in the

overall balance also recording a deficit of around US

dollars 4.0 billion in 2021, compared to a deficit of

US dollars 2.3 billion in 2020.

5.6 International Investment Position

In terms of the International Investment

Position (IIP), Sri Lanka’s external liability

position increased, while the external asset

position declined by end 2021 from end 2020.

Accordingly, the country’s external liability position

increased to US dollars 64.5 billion at end 2021

from US dollars 58.6 billion at end 2020, while the

country’s external asset position declined to US

dollars 8.8 billion at end 2021 from US dollars 10.9

billion reported at end 2020. Consequently, the net

liability position of the IIP increased to US dollars

55.7 billion at end 2021 from US dollars 47.7 billion

at end 2020.

Sri Lanka’s external asset position with

non-residents recorded a significant decline

during 2021. The stock position of external assets

decreased primarily due to the decline in gross

official reserves from US dollars 5.7 billion as at

end 2020 to US dollars 3.1 billion at end 2021.1

Meanwhile, the direct investment asset position that

represents direct investments abroad by Sri Lankan

residents increased marginally during the year.

The asset position of deposit taking corporations in

the form of currency and deposits increased, while

other accounts receivable recorded a decrease.

Meanwhile, the outstanding asset position of trade

credit and advances given to non-residents by

the private sector increased by end 2021 from the

position observed at end 2020.

Sri Lanka’s total liability position to non-

residents, as reflected in the IIP, also increased

significantly by end 2021. This is mainly due to

the increase in direct investment liabilities, increase

in currency and deposit liabilities of the Central

Bank and deposit taking corporations as well as

the increase in liabilities resulting from the SDR

allocation. The liability position of outstanding direct

investments in the form of equity increased by about

US dollars 4.0 billion due to substantial valuation

gains in a few major equity positions of non-resident

companies listed in the CSE. These equity gains

were prominent in some companies in particular,

as the equity position increased substantially from

the beginning of the year, resulting in significant

valuation gains for these non-resident investors

by the end of 2021. Further, the Central Bank’s

currency and deposits liability position increased

by end 2021, as a combined effect of entering into

new bilateral currency swap arrangements with

PBOC amounting to CNY 10 billion (equivalent to

around US dollars 1.5 billion) and the Bangladesh

Bank (US dollars 200 million) and the settlement of

the SAARCFINANCE swap facility with the RBI (US

dollars 400 million) during the year. Meanwhile, the

currency and deposits liability position of the deposit

taking corporations also increased by end 2021.

Further, the SDR liability position also increased

by end 2021 with the new allocation of SDR by

the IMF of around US dollars 787 million during

the year. However, the portfolio investment liability

position declined by end 2021 compared to that of

end 2020, mainly with the repayment of the maturing

ISB during the year and the decline in market prices

of outstanding Government ISBs. The foreign loan

liability position of the IIP also declined by end

2021, mainly contributed by the reduction in foreign

loan liabilities of the Central Bank and deposit

taking corporations. Nevertheless, the foreign loan

liability position of the Government recorded an

increase mainly in view of the two foreign currency

term financing facilities obtained during the year.

Further, outstanding trade credits received by Sri

Lankan importers decreased, while the outstanding

position of other accounts payable increased, with

an increase in ACU related liabilities of the Central

Bank during 2021.

5.6.1 Reserve Asset Position

Gross official reserves (GOR) declined to

US dollars 3.1 billion by end 2021 compared

to US dollars 5.7 billion recorded at end 2020.

The decline in GOR was a combined result of

significant foreign currency debt service payments

and the Central Bank intervention in the domestic

foreign exchange market, in view of moderate

foreign exchange inflows during the year. Major

inflows that helped replenish GOR during the

year included two foreign currency term financing

facilities of around US dollars 810 million from

the CDB, SDR allocation of approximately US

dollars 787 million by the IMF and bilateral

currency swap facilities with the PBOC of around

US dollars 1.5 billion (CNY 10 billion) and with

the Bangladesh Bank of US dollars 200 million.

However, the substantial foreign currency debt

service payments, including the repayment of

maturing ISB (US dollars 1.0 billion), principal

and interest payments related to foreign project

loans and foreign currency term financing facilities

(US dollars 2.2 billion), capital and interest

payments for Sri Lanka Development Bonds

(SLDBs) and the loans from Offshore Banking

Units (OBUs) (US dollars 2.3 billion), and the

Central Bank’s intervention in the domestic foreign

exchange market by way of supplying foreign

exchange to finance essential import bills, mainly

contributed to the decline in the GOR level during

the year. The end year GOR level was equivalent

to 1.8 months of imports (4.2 months of imports in

2020) and 23 per cent of the country’s short term

debt and liabilities on remaining maturity basis (43

per cent in 2020). Meanwhile, total international

reserves, which comprise both GOR and foreign

assets of the banking sector, also declined towards

end 2021 mainly due to the decline in official

reserves, although holdings of foreign assets of

deposit taking corporations recorded a moderate

increase. Total foreign assets of the country were

equivalent to 3.6 months of imports by end 2021

compared to 6.4 months of imports in 2020.

5.7 External Debt and Debt Servicing

5.7.1 External Debt

Sri Lanka’s total external debt position

increased in 2021, mainly with the increase in

the external debt of the Central Bank and deposit

taking corporations. The total external debt of

the country increased to US dollars 50.7 billion at

end 2021 from US dollars 49.0 billion by end 2020.

Although the total outstanding foreign loans of the

Government recorded an increase during the year,

mainly with the receipt of two foreign currency

term financing facilities obtained from the CDB,

the external debt stock of the Government, valued

at the market price, declined from US dollars 28.2

billion at end 2020 to US dollars 27.3 billion at end

2021. This was a result of the combined effect of the

decline in market prices of Sri Lanka’s outstanding

ISBs and the repayment of an ISB that matured in

July 2021. A key reason for the reduction of the

outstanding government external debt in 2021 was

due to lack of new borrowings from international

markets, while repayment of some external debt

obligations of the Government had to be met by

utilising Central Bank's reserves. Meanwhile, the

outstanding external debt of the Central Bank

increased significantly by end 2021 in comparison

to that of end 2020 due to the new bilateral currency

swap arrangements with the Bangladesh Bank and

the PBOC, although the international swap facility

with the RBI obtained in 2020 was repaid during the

year. The outstanding external debt of deposit taking

corporations also increased owing to the significant

increase in currency and deposits although the short

term loans position declined markedly. Meanwhile,

the outstanding external debt of the private sector

corporations and SOBEs declined in 2021 with the

reduction in outstanding trade credit received by

the private sector and with the repayment of foreign

loans of SOBEs, despite the increase in foreign

loans obtained by the private sector corporations.

Further, intercompany borrowing of DIEs recorded

an increase during 2021, as a number of DIEs

received intercompany loans and shareholder

advances during the year.

The total outstanding external debt of the

country as a percentage of GDP recorded a

marginal decline during the year. The total

stood at 60.0 per cent at end 2021, compared to

60.5 per cent reported at end 2020, reflecting the

increase in nominal GDP during 2021 compared to

2020. The outstanding external debt position of the

Government out of the total external debt position,

declined to 53.9 per cent by end 2021 from 57.5

per cent recorded at end 2020. In terms of the debt

maturity profile, debt with long term maturity declined

marginally to 50.0 per cent of GDP by end 2021

compared to 50.4 per cent of GDP by end 2020.

5.7.2 Foreign Debt Service Payments

Despite the marginal increase in capital

repayments, Sri Lanka’s external debt service

payments declined in 2021, compared to the

previous year due to the reduction in interest

payments. Capital repayments on external

debt increased to US dollars 3.1 billion in 2021,

compared to US dollars 3.0 billion recorded in

2020. Capital repayments in 2021 included the

bilateral currency swap facility obtained from the

RBI. Further, out of the US dollars 1 billion worth

of ISBs that matured during 2021, US dollars 700

million were paid to non-residents upon maturity,

while the remaining settlement was received

by the residents. Capital repayments of foreign

loans of the Government increased marginally

during the year. Meanwhile, capital repayments of

foreign loans by the private sector, SOBEs and

deposit taking corporations declined considerably

during the year, compared to the previous year.

During the year, the Central Bank continued to

repay the loan instalments related to the Extended

Fund Facility obtained in 2016 from the IMF as

a means of BOP support. Interest payments on

external debt declined during the year to US

dollars 1.4 billion, compared to US dollars 1.6

billion in 2020. This was mainly due to a decline in

coupon payments of ISBs issued to non-residents,

interest payments on foreign investments in

the rupee denominated government securities

market and interest payments on foreign loans

of the Government during the year. Due to the

combined effect of the increase in earnings

from merchandise exports and services and the

decline in external debt service payments in 2021

compared to the previous year, total external debt

service payments as a percentage of export of

goods and services decreased to 30.0 per cent

in 2021 from 35.2 per cent in 2020. The share of

the Government’s external debt service payments

also declined to 81.1 per cent of the total external

debt servicing in 2021 from 86.5 per cent in 2020.

5.8 Exchange Rate Movements

The Sri Lanka rupee was maintained broadly

at stable levels during 2021 and in early 2022,

before being allowed an adjustment in the

exchange rate in early March 2022. The rupee

exhibited some volatility exerting pressure to

depreciate, particularly during the first four months

of 2021 due to limited foreign currency liquidity in

the domestic foreign exchange market. This was

largely due to dried up foreign exchange inflows in

the form of both debt and non debt flows amidst

continued outflows to meet import bills and the

debt servicing requirements of the Government.

The Central Bank's intervention in the domestic

foreign exchange market and the continued use

of moral suasion helped stabilise the external

value of the Sri Lanka rupee during the remainder

of the year, and the first few months of 2022.

Accordingly, with the engagement of the Central

Bank, supported by the LCBs, the weighted

average spot exchange rate in the interbank

market remained broadly stable during the latter

part of 2021 at around Rs. 200 - 203 per US dollar.

As such, the annual depreciation of the rupee

was limited to 7.0 per cent against the US dollar

at end 2021, which helped mitigate the adverse

consequences of excessive depreciation of the

currency at the time the economy was on the

verge of recovering from the devastating shock

from the pandemic. The pressures observed in

the domestic foreign exchange market could also

be partly attributable to the inadequate conversion

of foreign exchange earnings by foreign exchange

earners. With the imposition of regulations on

mandatory conversion requirements of export

proceeds, the foreign exchange liquidity condition

in the domestic market improved to a certain

extent. Meanwhile, reflecting cross currency

exchange rate movements, the Sri Lanka rupee

appreciated against the Japanese yen (3.8 per

cent) and the euro (1.1 per cent), and depreciated

against the pound sterling (6.0 per cent) and

the Indian rupee (5.5 per cent) during 2021.

Furthermore, in the first two months of 2022, the

Sri Lanka rupee remained broadly stable due to

continued moral suasion. However, the pressures

witnessed on the exchange rate amidst dried up

liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market

were amplified in 2021 and early 2022, warranting

a measured adjustment that was allowed in the

exchange rate in early March 2022. However, the

outcome of the exchange rate flexibility that was

thereafter allowed also in early March 2022, fell

short of expectation due to large overshooting by

market forces. Accordingly, the Sri Lanka rupee

depreciated by 33.0 per cent against the US

dollar by end March 2022. Such developments,

along with the removal of other related regulatory

restrictions and newly imposed import restrictions

were expected to encourage more inflows

of foreign exchange to the domestic foreign

exchange market, particularly due to the net gain

for exporters and remitters while discouraging non

urgent imports and other outflows. Reflecting cross

currency exchange rate movements, the Sri Lanka

rupee depreciated against the euro (32.1 per cent),

the Indian rupee (31.7 per cent), the pound sterling

(31.1 per cent), and the Japanese yen (28.9 per

cent) by end March 2022.

Other major currencies depreciated against

the US dollar in 2021 in line with the broad-based

strengthening of the US dollar due to multiple

factors including elevated upside volatility

in energy prices, equity underperformance,

policy rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve

and liquidity concerns continuing to push

investors seeking US dollar as a safe haven

currency. Accordingly, by end 2021, the Japanese

yen (10.4 per cent), the euro (8.0 per cent), the

Indian rupee (1.6 per cent), and the pound sterling

(1.1 per cent) depreciated against the US dollar.

With the combined effect of the depreciation of

the rupee against most major currencies, the Sri

Lanka rupee depreciated against the SDR by 4.3

per cent and 32.1 per cent during 2021 and during

2022 until end March, respectively.

5.8.1 Nominal and Real Effective Exchange Rates

The 5-currency and the 24-currency Nominal

Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) indices,

which measure the movements of the Sri

Lanka rupee against the basket of currencies,

declined during the year. NEER indices declined,

reflecting the nominal depreciation of the Sri

Lanka rupee against selected major currencies

together with the movements in cross currency

exchange rates. Accordingly, the 5-currency and

24-currency NEER indices declined by 3.6 per

cent and 4.2 per cent, respectively in 2021. The

Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indices,

which consider the variation in nominal exchange

rates in the baskets of currencies, as well as the

inflation differentials among countries, showed

mixed performances. Accordingly, the 5-currency

REER index increased by 6.9 per cent, while

the 24-currency REER index declined by 2.6

per cent in 2021. However, the REER indices

remained predominantly below the base year

level (2017=100) in 2021, indicating the continued

competitiveness of the Sri Lanka rupee. With the

sharp depreciation of the exchange rate in March

2022, both NEER and REER indices declined

substantially, reflecting the nominal depreciation

of the Sri Lanka rupee against the US dollar and

other major currencies considered in the basket.

Accordingly, 5-currency NEER and REER indices

declined by 31.9 per cent and 31.1 per cent,

respectively, and 24-currency NEER and REER

indices declined by 32.1 per cent and 35.1 per

cent, respectively, by end March 2022.

5.8.2 Developments in the Domestic Foreign Exchange Market

The transaction volumes in the domestic

foreign exchange market further declined in

2021. Accordingly, the volume of interbank foreign

exchange transactions declined to US dollars 12,160

million in 2021, in comparison to US dollars 18,408

million in 2020. The total volume of spot exchange

transactions declined significantly to US dollars

5,852 million (48.1 per cent of total transactions)

in 2021, in comparison to US dollars 10,445 million

in 2020. The total volume of forward transactions

also decreased to US dollars 6,308 million in 2021

from US dollars 7,964 million in 2020. Meanwhile,

the Central Bank intervened in the domestic foreign

exchange market by way of supplying US dollars

747 million on a net basis in 2021. The net figure

was the result of the supply of US dollars 1,253

million and the purchase of US dollars 506 million

during the year. Moreover, the Central Bank

continued to intervene in the domestic foreign

exchange market during the first quarter of 2022

by supplying US dollars 265 million, on a net basis.

The intervention of the Central Bank helped avoid

large volatility in the exchange rate and supported

the need for financing essential imports to ensure

the avoidance of disruptions to the economy and

people. However, the fixed exchange rate that

prevailed during the latter part of 2021, is likely

to have helped importers to frontload imports at

cheaper costs, while exporters were reluctant

to convert their export proceeds, impacting the

domestic foreign exchange market negatively.

6.1 OverviewW

hile the country battled against the COVID-19 pandemic and multifaceted external sector

challenges, budgetary operations of the Central Government weakened in 2021 reflecting the

impact of deep rooted fiscal imbalances and unintended consequences of certain fiscal policy

measures. Mobilisation of government revenue as a percentage of GDP, which declined sharply in 2020,

further weakened to historic lows in 2021 with the revenue losses resulting from the pandemic induced subpar

economic performance and the continuation of the low tax regime instituted since late 2019. Meanwhile,

government expenditure remained unabated during the period under review, owing to higher expenditure

on account of salaries and wages and interest expenses along with the pandemic related outlays. Although

capital expenditure and net lending recorded a notable increase, public investments declined marginally

in 2021. Overall fiscal deficit further widened in 2021 while significantly deviating from the budgeted level

and reaching the highest level since 1988. With foreign financing avenues being limited with adverse global

market developments as well as sovereign credit rating downgrades, the Government was compelled to

rely mostly on the domestic banking sector, especially the Central Bank, to finance the budget deficit.

The Central Bank provided a substantial amount of funds to the Government to smoothen the functioning

of fiscal operations amidst the socio-economic challenges caused by the pandemic while maintaining an

accommodative monetary policy stance until August 2021 to maintain the borrowing cost at a lower level.

However, as excessive deficit financing through the banking sector is inflationary, a gradual phase out of

central bank financing and resorting to long term foreign financing options for deficit financing in an active

manner should be pursued to preserve monetary stability. Meanwhile, outstanding central government debt

grew to a disconcerting level by end 2021, both in nominal terms and as a percentage of GDP, and this growth

was a combined outcome of the widened fiscal deficit, increased market interest rates as well as the parity

variation, which was an outcome of exchange rate depreciation. A series of sovereign rating downgrades

by rating agencies occurred during 2021, in view of the deteriorating external liquidity position accentuated

by the reduction in foreign exchange reserves against high forthcoming debt repayments and inadequate

financing inflows. The fiscal sector outlook remains constrained with the lack of sufficient inflow of revenue,

sustainability concerns related to government debt, and deficit financing through domestic banking sources

amidst steady accumulation of debt, accelerated inflation, and vulnerabilities in the domestic financial

system stability and the external sector. Against this backdrop, strong fiscal consolidation measures remain

more vital than ever, particularly via revenue focused measures, in terms of introducing appropriate taxes

and broadening of tax base supplemented with strengthening the tax administration, in order to reverse the

dismal revenue mobilisation path, on a sustainable basis, while reducing government financing requirements.

Meanwhile, a tight rein on government expenses by refraining from ad hoc expenditure policies is essential

to ensure not derailing the fiscal consolidation path going forward. Accordingly, reducing the deficit in the

current account by streamlining recurrent expenditure while strengthening revenue mobilisation, and thereby

making concerted efforts with a credible plan to reach a surplus in the primary balance in the medium

term remains critical at this juncture to ensure sustainability of government debt. Implementing liability

management exercises in line with the Medium Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS), with necessary

revisions, and ongoing efforts on debt restructuring are also indispensable in smoothing debt repayments,

as well as lowering the near term risks to the fiscal sector.

the people from unforeseen catastrophes such as

the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, the Medium

Term Macro Fiscal Framework for 2021-2025

was aimed at increasing public investment to

5.4 per cent of GDP in 2021 while maintaining

public investments of over 5-6 per cent of GDP, on

average, in the medium term to facilitate high and

sustained economic growth. With the continuation

of the expenditure rationalisation measures,

recurrent expenditure was expected to remain at

around 14.2 per cent of GDP in 2021 and further

reduce to 12.3 per cent of GDP by 2025. With

these expected improvements, along with a higher

revenue collection of 14.2 per cent of GDP, the

budget deficit is expected to reduce to 4.0 per cent

of GDP in 2025. Meanwhile, it was expected that

the outstanding debt stock would be brought down

to 96.3 per cent of GDP in 2021 and further down to

75.5 per cent of GDP in the medium term. Reforming

State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) was also identified

as an integral part in reducing the pressure on fiscal

operations. Key fiscal targets announced for 2021

were, however, not materialised, since these targets

were driven by overoptimistic assumptions in the

context of a challenging economic environment

and policy inconsistencies that led to lower revenue

collection and rigid government expenses.

6.2 Fiscal Policy Measures1

The fiscal strategy of the Government as

envisaged in the Budget 2021 focused on

ensuring macroeconomic stability with the view

to fostering economic growth and development

of the country, though the anticipated fiscal

outcomes were not fully realised during 2021

primarily due to challenging macroeconomic

conditions and optimistic fiscal targets which

were not sufficiently buttressed by sufficient and

consistent policies. In line with the Government’s

fiscal strategy, the revenue collection was expected

to increase to 10.7 per cent of GDP in 2021, thereby

maintaining budget deficit and outstanding central

government debt at 8.8 per cent of GDP and

96.3 per cent of GDP, respectively, during 2021.

The medium term macro fiscal programme of the

Government was aimed at poverty alleviation

and economic revival, as envisaged within the

‘Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour’, the policy

framework of the Government. With higher

investments in economic and social infrastructure

of the Government, disparities are expected to be

minimised among the regions while safeguarding

During the year 2021, the commitment of

the Government to maintain a low tax regime

to promote swift economic recovery and

growth resulted in lacklustre performance

in government revenue. To this end, the tax

adjustments that have been instituted since late

2019 in relation to corporate income taxes, income

taxes at individual levels and Value Added Tax

(VAT) were maintained in 2021. Accordingly, the

Inland Revenue Act, No. 24 of 2017 was amended

in May 2021, incorporating revisions to taxes

which were announced in November 2019 and

other announcements made in January 2020 and

April 2021. In addition, several tax holidays were

granted on the gains and profits received by specific

start-ups after the completion of a two year period

from the implementation date. Accordingly, any

enterprise which sells recycled construction

materials in Sri Lanka, any business commenced

by an individual after the successful completion of

vocational education from any standardised and

acceptable institution for vocational education,

any enterprise set up by a resident person in

manufacturing of boats or ships in Sri Lanka, any

‘renewable energy project’ established with a

capacity to produce not less than one hundred Mega

Watts solar or wind power and supplied such power

to the national grid, and any enterprise initiated

by a resident person who constructs and installs

communication towers and related appliances

using local labour and local raw materials in Sri

Lanka or provide required technical services

for such construction or installation are allowed

to enjoy these tax holidays. Moreover, foreign

currency earnings of businesses that engage in

exporting gold, gems or jewellery, interest income

of multi-national companies, which are deposited

in foreign currency in any domestic bank, and

gains made by a person from the realisation of

lands or buildings, which were sold, exchanged or

transferred to a Sri Lanka Real Estate Investment

Trust (SLREIT) are exempted from income taxes

with effect from 01 April 2021, subject to the

provisions of the Inland Revenue (Amendment)

Act, No. 10 of 2021. Further, in March 2022,

Cabinet approval was granted to amend several

provisions in the Inland Revenue Act, No. 24 of

2017 in order to remove the complexity of such

provisions and accommodate requests of various

parties to increase tax compliance, while providing

reliefs for emerging sectors of the economy.

Meanwhile, the Value Added Tax Act, No. 14 of

2002 was amended in 2021, incorporating tax

revisions implemented since late 2019. During the

year, several specific enterprises/projects were

exempted from the Commodity Export Subsidy

Scheme (CESS) levy and Ports and Airports

Development Levy (PAL) to encourage exports

and foreign direct investments within the country.

Accordingly, any enterprise engaged in exporting

scrap/waste processed through manufacture of

exported goods, and the importation of goods by

any enterprise or a strategic development project,

with an investment of US dollars 50 million or above

in each stage during the project implementation

or construction period, were exempted from

CESS and PAL. Further, importation of medical

equipment was also exempted from PAL in order

to support the COVID-19 prevention programme.

Meanwhile, the Special Commodity Levy (SCL)

on the importation of several food items, such as

rice, potatoes, maize, dried fish, dairy products, big

onions and sprats was revised during the year to

provide necessary protection for farmers and as

supply side management measures to curtail the

increase in prices in the domestic market. Although

the aim of the aforementioned policies was to

revive economic activities faster, and in turn,

boost the revenue flows, the slow paced recovery

in economic activities adversely affected higher

government revenue in 2021.

During the year 2021 and early 2022, the

Government attempted to introduce several

measures aiming at reducing tax evasion

and minimising complexities in the tax

administration. Accordingly, measures were taken

to enact the legislation for tax amnesty under the

provisions of the Finance Act, No. 18 of 2021, which

inter alia provides for persons to voluntarily report

their undisclosed taxable supplies, income, and

assets for any taxable period ended on or prior to

31 March 2020, or in a return of income for any year

of assessment ended on or prior to 31 March 2020.

However, in the absence of strong enforcement

measures, revenue generated from tax amnesty

was limited to Rs. 174.6 million in 2021. Although

tax amnesties are implemented to meet short term

revenue shortfalls, such policies generally do not

create desirable outcomes as reflected in realised

data, and these policies may disincentivise law

abiding taxpayers and encourage corruption and

even, money laundering. Meanwhile, a bill was

presented to the Parliament in January 2022 to

impose a Special Goods and Services Tax (SGST)

as a composite tax in lieu of existing taxes on

liquor, cigarettes, vehicles (inclusive of parts for

assembling of vehicles), telecommunications,

and betting and gaming. The aim of the

imposition of SGST was to ensure the efficiency

in tax administration through the avoidance of

complexities associated with the application and

administration of multiple tax regimes on specified

goods and services. Nevertheless, considering

the petitions submitted against the SGST bill, the

Supreme Court determined that it needs to be

passed with a two-thirds majority in the Parliament

and a referendum due to the inconsistency of

several of its clauses with the Constitution. In

addition, several improvements were made to

tax administration, such as the mandatory use of

a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) in all tax

related source documents and making e-filing

compulsory for all limited liability companies.

Revisiting and simplifying the tax structure and

strengthening the tax administration remain

imperative at present to address the notable decline

in government revenue and improve government

finances on a long term basis.

The Government continued to channel

resources to offset the effects of the pandemic,

while supporting economically vulnerable

groups. Accordingly, the Government took

decisive measures to contain the spread of the

pandemic and to ensure the safety of the citizens,

while supporting livelihoods through the existing

social safety networks and accelerating the island

wide vaccination drive. In view of the increased

pressures of the pandemic on fiscal operations,

the Parliament approved a supplementary budget

of Rs. 200 billion in June 2021 to meet contingent

expenditure on account of the containment of the

COVID-19 pandemic within the already approved

borrowing limit of Rs. 2,997 billion for 2021.

Meanwhile, in January 2022, the Government

introduced a relief package of Rs. 229 billion with

the objective of minimising economic hardships

faced by the people due to the increase in prices

of goods and services. Under this relief package,

a monthly allowance of Rs. 5,000, which was not

taken into account for the calculation of pension

was granted to public officers and pensioners

with effect from January 2022, while a monthly

allowance was granted to Samurdhi beneficiaries

on a pro rata basis with a maximum limit of

Rs. 1,000 per month. In addition, several relief

measures are yet to be implemented, including

paying an additional Rs. 25 per kg of paddy to

farmers with the aim of increasing farmer income to

Rs. 75 per kg of paddy to compensate the income

losses associated with the expected production

losses in Maha season, providing each estate

sector family with 15 kg of flour at a subsidised

rate of Rs. 80 per kg, paying Rs. 5,000 to those

who cultivate homesteads encompassing less than

20 perches and Rs. 10,000 to those who cultivate

more than 20 perches and removing all taxes

on essential food items and medicinal products.

Although such extrabudgetary relief measures are

intended to provide assistance to the public, the

granting of reliefs in the absence of either non-debt

creating financing options or significant downward

adjustment in other expenditure, particularly at

the time of low government revenue mobilisation,

may possibly exacerbate the debt sustainability

concerns while instigating inflationary and external

sector pressures, which may eventually aggravate,

instead of ease, the burden on the public. Therefore,

such relief measures should be implemented with

due consideration of the impact of such policies on

the fiscal sector.

Given the continued increases in

government expenditure, shortfall in actual

revenue mobilisation and increased domestic

financing requirements, the borrowing limits as

well as milestones and fiscal rules related limits

were amended in 2021. Accordingly, a resolution

was approved by the Parliament to increase the

limit on Treasury bills to Rs. 3,000 billion from the

previous limit of Rs. 2,000 billion. In addition, the

Appropriation Act, No. 7 of 2020 was amended to

raise the gross borrowing limit by Rs. 400 billion

for 2021 to Rs. 3,397 billion in November 2021.

Meanwhile, the Fiscal Management (Responsibility)

Act, No. 3 of 2003 was also amended to shift the

timeline for achieving the debt to GDP target of 60

per cent to 2030 from 2020, and to increase the

limit on guarantees issued by the Government to

15 per cent of GDP from 10 per cent of GDP.

The Government continued to facilitate

State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), despite the

considerable burden on the central government

budget, and in many instances passing on the

burden to the state owned banks. Guidelines

were issued on corporate governance with the aim

of establishing a strategic framework for SOEs to

ensure transparency, fairness, accountability and

responsibility in line with international best practices.

These guidelines included provisions pertaining to

the duties of the Chairman and Boards of Directors

of SOEs and formation of their relationships with

stakeholders to safeguard public interest. Further,

an operational manual was issued to SOEs,

providing directions regarding their conduct of

business to accomplish their respective objectives

and improve their performance. Meanwhile, a

Management Committee on Investment was

appointed by the Cabinet of Ministers to facilitate

investments related to SOEs. Considering

the deteriorated financial performance of

SriLankan Airlines (SLA) amidst the pandemic,

the Government decided to infuse capital to SLA,

while issuing guarantees and a letter of comfort to

SLA in order to improve its financial viability. As a

result, two tranches totalling Rs. 27.7 billion were

issued to SLA in November 2020, and a further

Rs. 18.0 billion was issued in April 2021.

This was a part of the US dollar 500 million

capitalisation programme approved by the

Cabinet of Ministers on 26 October 2020.

Moreover, the Government approved the

reissuance of all expired letters of comfort in favour

of two state banks, equivalent to US dollar 205.4

million and Rs. 27.6 billion, through the General

Treasury, in order to continue the provision of short

term credit facilities. In addition, two state banks

disbursed new working capital facilities totalling

US dollar 75 million in 2021 to SLA to provide

Treasury guarantees, based on the approval

of the Cabinet of Ministers. Considering the

mounting financial losses of the Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation (CPC) and the resultant burden on the

banking sector, the Government allowed revision

of CPC’s domestic petroleum prices in 2021 and

early 2022. However, implementing cost reflective

pricing mechanisms for key SOEs and restructuring

SOEs in a transparent manner to enhance their

efficiency remain a priority consideration for the

Government in order to minimise the fiscal burden

of such entities.

Recognising subpar performance in revenue

mobilisation, the Government introduced short

term revenue enhancement measures through

the Budget 2022. Accordingly, a bill amending the

Value Added Tax Act, No. 14 of 2002 to increase

the VAT rate from 15 per cent to 18 per cent on the

supply of financial services on financial institutions

with effect from 01 January 2022 was passed

by the Parliament in March 2022. Meanwhile,

as proposed in the Budget 2022, excise duty

on liquor and cigarettes was revised upwards

in November 2021. Surcharge Tax Act, No. 14

of 2022 was enacted with the aim of imposing a

retrospective one time surcharge tax of 25 per

cent on individuals, partnerships, and companies,

whose taxable income is calculated in accordance

with the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act,

No. 24 of 2017, where their taxable income exceeds

Rs. 2 billion for the tax assessment year,

commencing 01 April 2020. Although the proposed

one off retrospective taxes would help raising

government revenue for a given year, such tax

policies may not generate government revenue on

a sustained basis. In addition, uncertainties created

by such retrospective taxes may hamper investor

confidence and appetite.

In 2022, the Government introduced several

measures with the aim of managing public

expenditure, amidst the limited fiscal space

and the foreign exchange liquidity shortage

in the country. During the year, the Government

attempted to rationalise expenditure by curtailing

the expenses on purchasing of vehicles, buildings,

and other assets, suspending new constructions

of buildings for state institutions, while prioritising

public investments based on the economic benefits

of such investments. In line with the Budget 2022,

the Government announced various measures in

November 2021 to curtail expenses by reducing the

provisions for electricity of government institutions

by 10 per cent, reducing the telephone expenses

of government institutions by 25 per cent, reducing

fuel allowance provided to government ministers

and government officials by 5 litres per month, and

suspending the construction of new office premises

for a period of two years. However, such measures

may not be adequate to sizeably reduce mounting

government expenditure and thereby improve

government finances. Amidst the prevailing foreign

exchange liquidity shortages of the country,

several guidelines were issued by the Government

in March 2022 to limit the consumption of electricity

and fuel by the public sector by minimising the

usage of vehicles, elevators, air conditioners, and

other electrical appliances. Further, considering

increased life expectancy and the resultant

capacity to remain active in the public service, the

compulsory retirement age of the public officers was

extended up to 65 years with effect from 01 January

2022 with the view to strengthening the labour

force of the country and reducing the expenditure

related to retirement benefits. Meanwhile, the age

of compulsory retirement of employees of SOEs

was also extended up to 62 years with effect from

01 January 2022.

International sovereign credit rating

agencies downgraded the sovereign credit

ratings of Sri Lanka during 2021, in view of

declining foreign exchange reserves amidst

high external debt repayments and inadequate

financing inflows. Standard and Poor’s Global

Ratings (S&P) downgraded Sri Lanka’s sovereign

credit rating to ‘CCC+ (Negative)’ from ‘CCC+

(Stable)’ on 27 August 2021, and further to ‘CCC

(Negative)’ on 12 January 2022. Although Fitch

Ratings maintained its rating at ‘CCC’ status for

more than a year since 27 November 2020, they

too downgraded Sri Lanka’s sovereign credit

rating to ‘CC’ on 17 December 2021. Similarly,

Moody’s Investor Service also downgraded Sri

Lanka’s sovereign credit rating to ‘Caa2 (Stable)’

from ‘Caa1 (Stable)’ on 28 October 2021. Such

rating decisions were primarily driven by the

assessments on fiscal imbalances, challenges

faced by the country in meeting external

financing requirements, uncertain policy outlook,

and the risk of a slowdown in fiscal consolidation.

Nevertheless, the Government repaid all its

debt servicing obligations in 2021, including the

International Sovereign Bond (ISB) of US dollars

1,000 million, which matured on 27 July 2021,

and the ISB of US dollars 500 million, which

matured on 18 January 2022.

6.3 Government Budgetary Operations

Revenue and Grants

Revenue

Government revenue recorded a sluggish

growth in 2021 yielding the historically lowest

tax to GDP ratio amidst the low tax regime

instituted since late 2019. In 2021, in nominal

terms, government revenue grew by 6.5 per cent,

year-on-year, to Rs. 1,457.1 billion, benefiting

mainly from the higher tax revenue collection from

VAT, income taxes, PAL, and CESS. Tax revenue

increased by 6.7 per cent to Rs. 1,298.0 billion in

2021 from Rs. 1,216.5 billion in the preceding year.

Meanwhile, in 2021, non tax revenue increased

to Rs. 159.1 billion in 2021 from Rs. 151.4 billion

in 2020 due to the rise in revenue collection from

profit and dividend transfers from SOEs and social

security contributions, despite the reduction in

fees and charges, rent income, interest income

and distributable profits transferred from the

Central Bank. However, government revenue as a

percentage of GDP declined to 8.7 per cent in 2021

from 9.1 per cent in the previous year. Tax revenue

as a percentage of GDP, which stood at a low level

of 8.1 per cent of GDP in 2020, further declined to

7.7 per cent during 2021. Both government revenue

and tax revenue as a percentage of GDP declined

to a record low since independence, owing to the

impact of the continuation of the low tax regime,

import restrictions imposed to ease external sector

pressure, and the modest pickup of the economy.

Meanwhile, non tax revenue as a percentage of

GDP declined to 0.9 per cent in 2021 compared

to 1.0 per cent recorded in 2020, whereas grants

received by the Government recorded a marginal

improvement to Rs. 6.7 billion in 2021 in comparison

to Rs. 5.3 billion registered in 2020.

Revenue from income taxes increased by

12.6 per cent, in nominal terms, to Rs. 302.1 billion

in 2021 from Rs. 268.2 billion in 2020. This

reflects of increased revenue mobilisation from all

income tax categories, except for the Economic

Service Charge (ESC) which was abolished in early

2020. With the increased revenue from income

taxes, the share of direct tax revenue in the total

tax revenue collection improved to 23.3 per cent

in 2021 over 22.1 per cent recorded in 2020.

Revenue from corporate and non corporate

income taxes increased notably to Rs. 273.6 billion

in 2021 compared to Rs. 228.3 billion recorded

in the previous year, indicating the recovery of

economic activities in 2021 compared to the

preceding year and improved performance

mainly in corporates. Revenue collection from

Advance Personal Income Tax (APIT) and

Withholding Tax (WHT) increased slightly

during the period under review to Rs. 15.4 billion

and Rs. 12.4 billion, respectively, compared to

Rs. 15.0 billion and Rs. 10.0 billion, respectively,

in 2020. Meanwhile, the arrears collected on ESC

amounted to Rs. 0.7 billion in 2021, following the

removal of ESC in January 2020. As a percentage

of GDP, revenue generated from income taxes

remained at 1.8 per cent in 2021, broadly

unchanged from 2020.

Revenue collection from VAT increased

supported by the revival in economic activity

during the year. Accordingly, revenue collection

from VAT increased to Rs. 308.2 billion in 2021

compared to Rs. 233.8 billion in 2020. As a

percentage of GDP, VAT revenue increased to

1.8 of per cent in 2021 from 1.6 per cent in 2020.

VAT revenue generated on account of domestic

economic activities increased to Rs. 185.5 billion in

2021 from Rs. 148.1 billion in 2020, while revenue

from VAT on imports related activities increased

to Rs. 122.8 billion in 2021 from Rs. 85.7 billion

in 2020. During the year, the share of revenue

from VAT on total revenue and total tax revenue

increased to 21.2 per cent and 23.7 per cent,

respectively, compared to 17.1 per cent and

19.2 per cent, respectively, recorded in 2020.

Meanwhile, the arrears collected on Nation

Building Tax (NBT) amounted to Rs. 0.4 billion in

2021, following the abolition of NBT in December

2019.

Revenue collection based on excise duties

declined in 2021, reflecting the weakening of

excise revenue sources with the continuation

of restrictions on motor vehicle imports that

were imposed in view of foreign exchange

liquidity issues in the country. Accordingly,

in nominal terms, revenue from excise duties

declined to Rs. 306.9 billion in 2021 from Rs. 322.0

billion in 2020, while as a percentage of GDP,

excise duties mobilisation declined to 1.8 per cent

in 2021 compared to 2.1 per cent in the preceding

year. Revenue collection from excise duty on

motor vehicles declined to Rs. 18.1 billion in 2021

from Rs. 48.8 billion in 2020 and Rs. 130.4 billion

in 2019. Meanwhile, revenue from excise duty

on cigarettes and tobacco also declined to

Rs. 88.5 billion in 2021 from Rs. 94.3 billion in

2020. Revenue from excise duty on petroleum

products increased to Rs. 55.3 billion in 2021

from Rs. 53.1 billion in 2020 due to increased

refined petroleum imports during the period under

review. In addition, revenue from excise duty on

liquor also increased by 14.6 per cent to Rs. 138.6

billion in 2021 due to increased liquor production,

reflecting the recovery in hotel/ restaurant/tourism

related services amidst the pandemic related

disturbances.

Revenue from international trade related

taxes showed a mixed performance in 2021,

amidst the restrictions on the importation of

several nonessential items. Revenue collection

from Customs duties declined to Rs. 64.3 billion

in 2021, from Rs. 114.2 billion recorded in 2020.

Apart from the import restrictions, reduction of the

Customs duty rate from 30 per cent to 15 per cent on

selected items that was implemented in November

2020 in line with the simplification of the Customs

duty structure, also contributed to the decline

in revenue generated from international trade

activities. Meanwhile, revenue collection from SCL

also declined by 32.5 per cent to Rs. 55.8 billion in

2021 compared to Rs. 82.7 billion in 2020. Import

restrictions on several non-essential items, tax rate

reductions on dried fish, big onions and potatoes,

and the imposition of duty waivers on salt, rice,

desiccated coconut and maize caused the decline

in revenue mobilisation from SCL. On the other

hand, revenue from PAL and CESS levy increased

during the year, despite the import restrictions

on various non-essential items and exemptions

granted on medical equipment, projects related

goods, and selected items. Accordingly, revenue

from PAL increased to Rs. 154.1 billion in 2021

from Rs. 115.4 billion in 2020, while revenue from

CESS levy increased by 53.2 per cent to Rs. 75.5

billion in 2021 over 2020. Increase in rates on CESS

levy for selected items in line with the simplification

of the Customs duty structure in November 2020,

contributed to the rise in revenue collection from

CESS levy.

During the year, non tax revenue increased,

in nominal terms, reflecting the rise in revenue

collection from profit and dividend transfers

of SOEs and social security contributions.

Accordingly, non tax revenue increased to

Rs. 159.1 billion in 2021 from Rs. 151.4 billion

in 2020. Profit and dividend transfers of SOEs

increased by 73.6 per cent to Rs. 30.6 billion in

2021 compared to 2020, reflecting the impact of

the recovery of economic activities. Revenue

from social security contributions increased by

6.8 per cent, year-on-year, to Rs. 34.6 billion

during the period under review. However, revenue

from interest and rent income declined to Rs. 11.6

billion in 2021 in comparison to Rs. 19.4 billion

in 2020, while revenue from fees and charges

declined by 10.0 per cent to Rs. 42.6 billion in

2021. The distributable profits of the Central Bank

that were transferred to the Government in 2021

amounted to Rs. 15.0 billion compared to Rs. 24.0

billion in 2020.

Grants

Foreign grants received from bilateral and

multilateral sources increased to Rs. 6.7 billion

in 2021 from Rs. 5.3 billion in 2020. Foreign

grants from bilateral sources increased to Rs. 3.2

billion in 2021 from Rs. 2.8 billion in 2020, while

foreign grants from multilateral sources increased

to Rs. 3.5 billion in 2021 from Rs. 2.5 billion in

2020. The Government of Japan, the Asian

Development Bank (ADB), and the Department of

Agriculture of the United States were among the

major development partners who provided grants

during 2021.

Expenditure and Net Lending

During the year, total expenditure and net

lending increased owing to the increases in

both the recurrent expenditure, and capital

expenditure and net lending. Accordingly, total

expenditure and net lending increased significantly

by Rs. 480.7 billion to Rs. 3,521.7 billion (21.0 per

cent of GDP) in 2021 compared to Rs. 3,041.0

billion (20.2 per cent of GDP) recorded in 2020. In

2021, total expenditure and net lending accounted

for 99.9 per cent of the annual estimate for 2021

and 105.9 per cent of the revised annual estimate

for 2021. Recurrent expenditure increased

to Rs. 2,747.5 billion in 2021 compared to

Rs. 2,548.4 billion recorded in 2020, reflecting

higher expenses on account of salaries and

wages, and interest payments. During the period

under review, capital expenditure and net lending

also increased notably to Rs. 774.2 billion from

Rs. 492.6 billion in 2020.

In 2021, higher expenditure incurred on

account of salaries and wages and interest

payments contributed to the rise in recurrent

expenditure. Expenditure on salaries and

wages increased by Rs. 51.5 billion to Rs. 845.7

billion in 2021, compared to Rs. 794.2 billion

in 2020, partially due to the recruitment of low

skilled individuals from low income families and

unemployed graduates and the diploma holders

in September 2020, on top of the impact of

the annual increments in salaries and wages.

Expenditure on salaries and wages for 2021

accounted for 58.0 per cent of the government

revenue, and 30.8 per cent of the total recurrent

expenditure. Interest payments also rose by

6.9 per cent to Rs. 1,048.4 billion in 2021 from

Rs. 980.3 billion in 2020 reflecting the impact of the

rise in domestic interest payments, following the

increased interest payments on Treasury bonds.

Interest paid on Treasury bonds amounted to Rs.

593.4 billion in 2021 compared to Rs. 550.5 billion

in 2020 due to the increase in borrowings through

Treasury bond issuances by Rs. 1,248.4 billion

to Rs. 6,968.0 billion in 2021. Interest payments

accounted for 72.0 per cent of government

revenue in 2021 compared to 71.7 per cent in

2020, underlining the pressing concern of lack of

adequate revenue mobilisation at least to cover

the rigid recurrent expenditure of the Government.

Meanwhile, expenditure on subsidies and transfers

declined to Rs. 684.5 billion in 2021 from Rs. 717.1

billion in 2020 due to the reduction in subsidies to

the household sector because of the removal of

the fertiliser subsidy granted for chemical fertiliser

since the Yala season of 2021 and the reduction

in expenditure on subsidy programmes such as

subsidy for school and higher education season

tickets, financial support for elderly over 70 years

of age, etc. However, pension payments increased

by 4.7 per cent to Rs. 269.8 billion in 2021, while

expenditure in relation to Samurdhi payments

increased by 5.7 per cent to Rs. 55.4 billion in

capital expenditure declined to Rs. 767.6

billion in 2021 from Rs. 795.4 billion in 2020,

in the absence of the adjustment of arrears

payments of capital expenditure in 2020. Key Fiscal Balances and Financing the Budget Deficit

The key fiscal balances remained weak

in 2021 owing to lower government revenue

collection and the unabated government

expenditure. According to the fiscal sector statistics

of the Ministry of Finance, the overall budget deficit

as a percentage of GDP further weakened to

12.2 per cent (Rs. 2,057.9 billon) in 2021 from

11.1 per cent (Rs. 1,667.7 billion) reported in

2020. The current account deficit that reflects the

dissavings of the Government also remained high at

7.7 per cent of GDP (Rs. 1,290.4 billion) in

2021, broadly unchanged from 7.9 per cent

of GDP (Rs. 1,180.4 billion) reported in 2020.

Meanwhile, the primary deficit, which reflects

the effects of discretionary fiscal policy of

the current year and computed by excluding

interest payments from the overall budget

deficit, also weakened to 6.0 per cent of GDP

(Rs. 1,009.5 billion) in 2021, compared to 4.6 per

cent of GDP (Rs. 687.4 billion) registered in 2020.

The Government mainly relied on domestic

sources to finance the overall budget deficit

in 2021, reflecting its preference of the

Government to reduce the exposure to foreign

financing alternatives, amidst the limited access

to foreign sources. As per the Ministry of Finance,

net financing through domestic sources, which

includes all net borrowing through Treasury bills and

Treasury bonds, Offshore Banking Units (OBUs)

and Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs),

amounted to Rs. 2,071.8 billion and accounted

for 12.3 per cent of GDP in 2021 compared to

11.7 per cent of GDP in 2020. Meantime, the net

foreign repayment that includes net repayment of

ISBs stood at Rs. 13.9 billion.

During 2021, the deficit financing from

domestic sources, especially through the

banking sector, resulted in an upward pressure

on the yields on government securities and short

term money market rates. Government borrowings

from the banking sector accounted for 63.0 per

cent (Rs. 1,304.3 billion) of total net domestic

financing. Out of this quantum, the net central

bank financing stood at Rs. 1,225.2 billion.

Net financing from commercial banks amounted

to Rs. 79.1 billion in 2021. Meanwhile, financing

from the non-bank sector, which are considered

noninflationary sources, amounted to Rs. 767.5

billion with a share of 37.0 per cent of total

net domestic financing in 2021. In terms of

instruments, 62.8 per cent (Rs. 1,301.5 billion) of

the domestic financing was sourced from Treasury

bonds followed by 30.7 per cent (Rs. 635.1 billion)

and 16.6 per cent (Rs. 343.0 billion) from Treasury

bills and overdraft facilities, respectively. However,

borrowings from OBUs and SLDBs recorded net

repayments during 2021.

Total foreign financing recorded a

repayment of Rs. 13.9 billion, on net basis,

during 2021 along with the repayment of

Rs. 199.9 billion (US dollar 1 billion) for ISBs.

The net financing through the Foreign Currency

Term Financing Facility (FCTFF) were recorded at

Rs. 146.7 billion (US dollar 0.7 billion) during 2021,

as a result of new borrowings of Rs. 164.9 billion

(US dollar 0.8 billion) and repayment of Rs. 18.2

billion (US dollar 0.1 billion) during 2021.

6.4 Government Debt and Debt Service Payments

Central Government Debt

Continued high budget deficit resulting from

persistently weak fiscal performance, which

exacerbated during the pandemic times, led to

a substantial increase in outstanding central

government debt by end 2021. In nominal terms,

the total outstanding central government debt

stock increased to Rs. 17,589.4 billion at end 2021

from Rs. 15,117.2 billion recorded by end 2020.

With the increased financing requirements amidst

limited global market access due to unfavourable

international market conditions, global appetite

for safe haven assets and unappealing sovereign

credit ratings of Sri Lanka, and the reliance on

domestic sources for financing the budget deficit

triggered a notable change in the composition

of outstanding stock of central government

debt. Consequently, the share of domestic debt

increased to 63.1 per cent of the total outstanding

debt of the Central Government by end 2021

compared to 60.0 per cent recorded in the previous

year. Meanwhile, the quantum of foreign debt as a

share of total outstanding central government debt

declined to 36.9 per cent by end 2021 compared to

40.0 per cent recorded at end 2020. Reflecting the

subpar performance in the key fiscal variables, the

central government debt to GDP ratio increased to

104.6 per cent by end 2021 from 100.6 per cent

at end 2020. The share of domestic debt as a

percentage of GDP increased notably to 66.0 per

cent by end 2021 from 60.3 per cent at end 2020,

while the share of foreign debt as a percentage of

GDP decreased to 38.6 per cent at end 2021 from

40.3 per cent reported at end 2020. Moreover, the

level of foreign currency denominated debt as a

share of total outstanding central government debt

declined to 42.4 per cent by end 2021 from 47.5 per

cent that prevailed at end 2020, reflecting a higher

concentration towards financing budget deficit

through domestic sources as well as settlement

of foreign debt obligations including the ISB which

matured in 2021. However, the Average Time to

Maturity (ATM) of the outstanding total debt stock

declined to 5.2 years at end 2021 compared to 5.7

years at end 2020 due to increased borrowings

raised through short term debt instruments.

The total domestic debt of the Central

Government witnessed an increase of

Rs. 2,032.2 billion from end 2020, reaching

Rs. 11,097.2 billion by end 2021.2 With increased

reliance on short term financing amidst less market

appetite for longer tenure maturities of government

securities, particularly at the preannounced maximum

yield rates as well as the market expectations for

interest rate hikes, short term domestic debt stock

increased by 42.9 per cent to Rs. 3,139.8 billion by

end 2021 from Rs. 2,197.6 billion reported at end

2020. Accordingly, the share of short term debt in total

domestic debt stock also increased to 28.3 per cent

towards end 2021 from 24.2 per cent at end 2020.

In nominal terms, the increase in the short term

debt stock was largely driven by the increase in the

outstanding stock of Treasury bills, with a growth

of 40.1 per cent, to Rs. 2,270.5 billion at end 2021,

compared to Rs. 1,620.7 billion recorded at end

2020. Consequently, the share of Treasury bills in

total domestic debt stock as at end 2021 increased

to 20.5 per cent from 17.9 per cent at end 2020.

However, the outstanding debt stock on account

of provisional advances to the Government by

the Central Bank witnessed a marginal reduction

to reach Rs. 150.1 billion by end 2021 from

Rs. 153.1 billion at end 2020. As the Government was

compelled to depend more on short term instruments

for deficit financing during 2021, the share of medium

and long term debt in the total domestic debt stock

declined to 71.7 per cent from 75.8 per cent recorded

at end 2020. However, in nominal terms, the medium

and long term domestic debt stock also increased by

15.9 per cent to Rs. 7,957.4 billion by end 2021 from

Rs. 6,867.5 billion recorded at end 2020. Treasury

bonds, which continued to dominate the outstanding

domestic debt portfolio, accounted for about

62.8 per cent of the total outstanding domestic debt

stock during the year in comparison to 63.0 per cent

recorded at end 2020. In nominal terms, Treasury

bonds in the domestic debt increased by 21.9 per cent

to Rs. 6,966.2 billion compared to Rs. 5,713.3 billion

recorded at end 2020. Meanwhile, SLDBs holdings of

the residents declined to Rs. 455.2 billion (US dollars

2,271.1 million) from Rs. 486.9 billion (US dollars

2,611.9 million) reported at end 2020. In addition, the

ISBs owned by the domestic residents also declined

from Rs. 415.8 billion (US dollars 2,230.4 million)

at end 2020 to Rs. 372.6 billion (US dollars 1,859.0

million) by the end of 2021. This was mainly due to

the maturing of the ISB amounting to US dollars 1

billion, of which US dollars 371.3 million was repaid

to domestic bond holders. Moreover, outstanding

debt from OBUs recorded a decline of Rs. 88.1 billion

from end 2020 to Rs. 139.3 billion (US dollars 695.0

million) by the end of the year 2021. The outstanding

foreign currency denominated domestic debt at end

2021 decreased by Rs. 162.9 billion to Rs. 967.1

billion (US dollars 4,825.1 million) from Rs. 1,130.0

Meanwhile, debt obligation of the Central

Government to the domestic banking sector

increased notably to Rs. 5,467.1 billion at end 2021

due to the increase in outstanding government debt

owed to commercial banks and the Central Bank

reaching Rs. 3,901.6 billion and Rs. 1,565.5 billion,

respectively. The significant increase in the central

government debt held by the Central Bank was due

to the increased Treasury bills holding amounting

to Rs. 1,391.3 billion during 2021 in comparison

to Rs. 654.6 billion in 2020. This was a result of

the subscription of Treasury bills by the Central

Bank at primary auctions amidst subdued market

subscription and administrative special allocations

of Treasury bills to the Central Bank. Meanwhile,

the outstanding debt owned by commercial banks

increased to Rs. 3,901.6 billion at end 2021 mainly

due to higher investments in Treasury bonds by

commercial banks in 2021. The stock of Treasury

bonds held by commercial banks increased to

Rs. 1,646.8 billion at end 2021 from Rs. 1,513.3 billion

reported at end 2020. However, the share of the

banking sector debt in total domestic debt declined

to 49.3 per cent by end 2021 from 52.2 per cent at

end 2020. Meanwhile, the outstanding government

debt stock held by the nonbank sector amounted

to Rs. 5,630.1 billion at end 2021 as against

Rs. 4,333.4 billion at end 2020.

Rs. 6,492.2 billion by end 2021.4 However,

due to the limited access to foreign sources, the

explicit financing strategy of the Government

to rely primarily on domestic sources, and net

repayment of ISBs, the share of foreign debt in the

total outstanding debt stock declined to 36.9 per

cent at end 2021 from 40.0 per cent witnessed at

end 2020. Within the total foreign debt portfolio,

the share of non-concessional debt increased

to 52.3 per cent by end 2021 from 50.6 per cent

at end 2020 on account of increased receipt

of multilateral loans and foreign currency term

financing facility as well as the impact of the

depreciation of the rupee. In nominal terms, the

outstanding balance of the non-concessional debt

stock increased by 10.8 per cent to Rs. 3,394.6

billion at end 2021 from Rs. 3,064.1 billion recorded

at end 2020. Despite the repayment of US dollars

1.0 billion worth of ISB to both resident (US

dollars 371.3 million) and nonresident investors

(US dollars 628.7 million), the rupee value of the

ISBs holding held by nonresidents increased by

Rs. 39.8 billion due to the depreciation of the Sri

concessional debt of the total foreign debt stock

declined marginally to 47.7 per cent by end 2021

compared to 49.4 per cent reported by end 2020.

Foreign currency denominated outstanding debt, which stood at US dollars 38,492.7 million at end 2020 declined to US dollars 37,206.1 million by end 2021. Due to the parity variation caused by the depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee against debt denominated foreign currencies, the rupee value of foreign currency debt increased by around Rs. 500.2 billion at end 2021. The parity variation on the outstanding foreign project loans, FCTFF and ISBs amounted to Rs. 474.3 billion, while the same on the outstanding SLDBs and OBUs stood at Rs. 25.9 billion. If the debt denominated in foreign currency is serviced using foreign currency inflows to the Government, the impact of the nominal increase in the outstanding debt stock in rupee terms due to parity change would be less material. However, utilisation of a substantial amount of rupee funds to meet foreign currency debt servicing payments by the Government and financing the resultant increase in government borrowing requirements heavily through the banking sector, amidst the decline in foreign exchange inflows to the Government, remain concerns.

Central government debt of Sri Lanka elevated to disconcerting levels during the past two years, reflecting the impact of

while strengthening revenue mobilisation with a

credible and consistent commitment is of utmost

importance in order to record a surplus in the

primary balance in the medium term, thereby

ensuring sustainability of government debt.

Central Government Debt Service Payments

Total debt service payments increased by

22.4 per cent in nominal terms to Rs. 2,375.6

billion in 2021 with the rise in both debt

amortisation and interest payments. Domestic

debt repayments, i.e., domestic amortisation

payments, increased by 74.5 per cent to

Rs. 795.5 billion in 2021, mainly due to the

increase in maturing of Treasury bonds and

SLDBs. Foreign debt repayments increased by

5.3 per cent to Rs. 531.7 billion in 2021, primarily

reflecting the settlement of Rs. 199.9 billion (US

dollars 1 billion) worth of ISB maturities in July

2021 and the repayments in FCTFF amounting to

Rs. 330.6 billion during the year. Consequently,

total amortisation payments, which accounted for

55.9 per cent of total debt service payments,

increased by 38.1 per cent to Rs. 1,327.2 billion

in 2021 from Rs. 961.1 billion in the preceding

persistent fiscal deficits, restricted access to concessional financing and adverse implications driven by interest rate and exchange rate movements. Although foreign debt as a percentage of GDP marginally declined to 38.6 per cent in 2021 from 40.3 per cent in 2020, risks related to foreign debt servicing in the near term heightened due to the depletion of gross official reserves to low levels in the backdrop of the challenging domestic macroeconomic developments, uncertainties in the international capital markets triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as unfavourable sovereign credit rating downgrades. Unless augmented by foreign currency inflows under a creditable anchor, foreign currency debt service payments, which are falling due over US dollars 5 billion annually, on average, from 2022 onwards would be an extremely challenging task for Sri Lanka. Prudent fiscal policy measures and resource augmentation are required immediately, along with a reprofiling of debt portfolio. Meanwhile, the medium term policy priority should be to use debt financing mainly for the repayment of both domestic and foreign currency debt, without capitalising interest payments to avoid further accumulation of debt. Although foreign currency debt could be raised to meet near term foreign currency debt servicing obligations, further borrowings should be gradually reduced over the medium term, once non-debt creating inflows are in place, while aligning new financing requirements arising from overall fiscal deficit in line with resource availability. Given the heightened debt related vulnerabilities, the country needs sound liability management practices in line with the Medium Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS), with necessary revisions, to guide effective debt management operations towards debt stabilisation. Current efforts on debt restructuring are also critical to reduce the debt burden in the near term by smoothing the debt service payments over a longer period.

year. Meanwhile, interest payments on central

government debt increased by 6.9 per cent to

Rs. 1,048.4 billion in 2021 on account of increased

interest payments on domestic outstanding debt.

Interest payments on central government

domestic debt increased by 11.4 per cent to

Rs. 794.6 billion in 2021, due to the notable

increase in domestic borrowings during the year

compared to the previous year amidst limited

access to foreign financing and rise in domestic

interest rates, particularly towards the latter half

of 2021. With the reduction in interest payments on

ISBs, FCTFF and project loans, interest payments

on foreign debt decreased to Rs. 253.8 billion in

2021 in comparison to Rs. 266.7 billion recorded

in 2020. Overall, domestic debt service payments

increased by 36.0 per cent to Rs. 1,590.1 billion,

while foreign debt service payments marginally

increased by 1.8 per cent to Rs. 785.5 billion during

2021.

With the mounting debt stock and the

resultant high interest payments, the main

indicators related to debt service payments

elevated in 2021. Total debt service payments

increased to 14.1 per cent of GDP in 2021 from

12.9 per cent of GDP in the previous year.

Amortisation payments on domestic debt as a

percentage of GDP increased to 4.7 per cent in

2021 from 3.0 per cent in 2020, while amortisation

payments for foreign debt as a percentage of GDP

declined marginally to 3.2 per cent in 2021 from

3.4 per cent in 2020. However, total interest

payments as a percentage of GDP decreased to

6.2 per cent in 2021 from 6.5 per cent in 2020. Interest

payments on domestic debt as a percentage of GDP

remained broadly unchanged at 4.7 per cent in

2021, while interest payments on foreign debt

decreased to 1.5 per cent of GDP in 2021 from

1.8 per cent of GDP in the previous year. Meanwhile,

the ratio of central government debt service

payments to government revenue deteriorated

to 163.0 per cent in 2021 from 141.9 per cent in

2020, underscoring the gravity of the government

debt burden, as the total debt service payment of

the Government significantly exceeded government

Outstanding Public Debt

The outstanding public debt stock, which

includes outstanding central government

debt stock, foreign project loans received by

State-Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs),

and public guaranteed debt, increased notably

during 2021 largely due to the rise in central

government debt stock. As a percentage of

GDP, the outstanding public debt stock increased

to 115.5 per cent of GDP by end 2021 from

109.4 per cent of GDP recorded at end 2020.

In absolute terms, the outstanding public debt

witnessed a substantial increase of 18.1 per cent to

Rs. 19,407.3 billion by end 2021 from Rs. 16,427.1

billion reported at end 2020. The total outstanding

central government debt stock accounted for

90.6 per cent of the outstanding total public debt.

Meanwhile, in absolute terms, public guaranteed

debt witnessed an increase of 52.8 per cent

reaching Rs. 1,506.7 billion at end 2021 compared

to Rs.986.4 billion at end 2020 accounting for

7.8 per cent of total outstanding public debt. Of

the total outstanding public guaranteed debt,

62.1 per cent was denominated in foreign currency.

Moreover, the outstanding debt relating to foreign

project loans received by the SOBEs declined to

Rs. 311.2 billion at end 2021 from Rs. 323.5 billion

at end 2020 due to the repayment of outstanding

loans by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and the

Since long, State Owned Enterprises (SOEs)1 have played a key role in the socioeconomic development of countries. Healthy SOEs have made significant contributions to employment creation, poverty alleviation, fiscal stability, development of a sector or geographical area, environmental protection and even sector regulation as witnessed in several countries, including Asian peers such as Singapore, Japan, China and Korea.

Although during recent decades there has been a growing consensus in favour of privatisation and deregulation, the role of SOEs has not diminished, especially in developing countries. This is primarily because SOEs continue to be the providers of essential infrastructure and public services which have the highest impact on economic growth, development and overall wellbeing of the population. However, SOEs in the developing world generally tend to be straddled by low productivity, while distorting competition and being afflicted by corruption. This has resulted in them being a significant burden on the budget and the government, and in some cases leading to fiscal and economic crises. It is essential that Sri Lanka remains wary of the performance of its own SOEs in this context.

Evolution of SOEs in Sri Lanka

The development of public sector enterprises in Sri Lanka dates back to the Second World War period of 1939 – 1945, when several SOEs were set up to provide essential goods whose supply had been curtailed during the war. In the mid 1950s, the interest in socialism piqued with the successes in the Soviet Union and the adoption of a socialist ideology of development in India during the same time. Accordingly, the Government of the time considered central planning as essential for the development of the country.

During this period, two key enactments catalysed the development process of SOEs, i.e. the Government Sponsored Corporations Act No. 19 of 1955 and the State Industrial Corporations Act No. 49 of 1957, respectively. The former sought to incorporate existing industrial undertakings, while the latter empowered the Government to set up and carry out any industrial activity. By 1957, several important SOEs had commenced operations, including those related to cement, paper, ceramics, leather and footwear. Another key development during this period was the nationalisation of bus companies leading to the formation of the Ceylon Transport Board in 1958.

BOX 7Restrategising State Owned Enterprises as Growth Facilitators

In 1959, a Ten Year Plan which emphasised import substituting industrialisation was introduced – although the plan was not entirely operational, it closely guided the economic policies of the following years. Accordingly, ‘basic industries’ such as cement, steel, paper, tyres, mineral sands, salt, flour milling, plywood, petroleum refining and fertiliser, were to be undertaken by the Government. However, some areas which were of interest to the Government were also open for private enterprise participation, such as footwear, ceramics, textiles and leather products. This inward oriented development strategy was warranted by the persistent deficits in the balance of payments and the resultant introduction of a series of stringent import controls from 1960 onwards.

The 1970s saw a fresh slew of measures towards autarky, including the setting up of several monopolies in the public sector through both establishment of new enterprises and a series of nationalisations and acquisition of private ventures. The creation of SOEs was expected to be beneficial as it was premised that, as natural monopolies, they would supply services or products at costs which were below than what potential private players could offer and that they would also be able to meet the demand of the entire market, perhaps also with export potential. Accordingly, in subsequent years, there was nationalisation of privately owned business undertakings such as those engaged in port services, passenger transport and plantations, among others. By the mid 1970s, major economic and social activities such as banking, plantations, large scale industries, transport, insurance, telecommunications, postal services, ports, electricity, import and distribution of petroleum, roads, health and education were either public sector monopolies or were largely undertaken by public enterprises. The numbers of SOEs rose rapidly from 14 in 1962 to over 280 public enterprises by the mid 1980s.

By the mid 1980s, it was noted that public enterprises were facing a multitude of issues. These included operational inefficiencies translating into poor financial performance, subpar quality of products and services and supply shortages, recruitments driven by political considerations rather than the needs of the SOEs, inability to mobilise resources to meet large investment requirements, and, excessive dependence on the government budget. The growing burden of SOEs on the budget alongside multilateral donor agencies highlighting the urgent need for macroeconomic stabilisation led to the Government announcing privatisation as a state policy in 1988. The divestiture programme commenced in 1989 and, over the period till 1993, partial or full divestitures of about 43 commercial enterprises were undertaken. However, this divestiture programme came under much criticism in the period thereafter. Many of Sri Lanka’s experiences with privatisation highlight that the weaker the economy and governing institutions, the more arduous it is to reap the benefits of privatisation.

1 There is no commonly accepted definition for an SOE (European Commission, 2013; IMF 2014; OECD 2015). However, some characteristics of SOEs are as follows: (1) the entity has its own, separate legal personality; (2) the entity is at least partially controlled by a government unit; and (3) the entity engages predominantly in commercial or economic activities (IMF, 2020). The Government Financial Statistics Manual 2014 (IMF, 2014) states that assessing government control of any entity involves judgment. Accordingly, a government may exercise significant influence over corporate decisions even when it owns a small number of shares.

Current Status of SOEs in Sri Lanka

Over the last three decades, successive governments have alternated between attempts at privatisation and nationalisation. Currently, there are over 400 SOEs operating in several key sectors including power, energy, finance and insurance, water, aviation, health and education, among others. While a large majority of SOEs are regulated by the ‘Administer Part II’ of the Finance Act No. 38 of 1971, of recent times, several have been established under the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007. Of these, 52 SOEs have been identified as State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs) as they are regarded to be strategically important to the functioning and transformation of the economy. SOBEs in Sri Lanka include the Bank of Ceylon, People’s Bank, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd, Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), Sri Lanka Ports Authority, SriLankan Airlines, Sri Lanka Transport Board and State Pharmaceuticals Corporation, among others.

Despite their pivotal role in the economy across strategic sectors, the poor financial performance of SOEs has become a heavy fiscal burden with significant macroeconomic implications. The excessive reliance of SOEs on the banking system to fund their losses has not only crowded out productive investments but has also rendered the financial system vulnerable to their weak financial performance. Macroeconomic stability is also threatened as their burgeoning financial losses weigh down on their ability to smoothly fulfill domestic demand for essential goods and services. Recognising the issue, in recent years, the Government undertook several initiatives to reform SOEs. Key reforms in this regard are the introduction of a Statement of Corporate Intent (SCI) as a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding signed by the respective enterprise, line Ministry and Ministry of Finance and the introduction of a regulatory framework for SOEs that provides commercial freedom, while increasing their level of accountability. Policy reforms have also been identified to amalgamate or consolidate SOEs with similar objectives and those at similar stages of the value chain thereby creating ‘economies of scale’ for these enterprises. Further, the Government also recently formed Selendiva Investments Ltd, a fully state owned company, to manage and consolidate several high end real estate assets in a bid to capitalise on the success of ‘holding company’ models, as seen in Singapore and Malaysia.

In the post COVID-19 recovery process of the economy, where an urgent correction of the course of the economy has become necessary, there is a dire need to expedite such reforms and further focus on the rigorous and rapid transformation of SOEs as growth facilitators. This is essential to improve their efficiency, productivity and profitability and thereby empower them to contribute to the economy’s recovery process in an effective and sustainable manner, without being a persistent economic issue. A few such key reforms that may be considered are discussed.

Proposed Major SOE Reforms

a. Introduction of Cost Reflective Pricing Policies

Often SOEs have to strike a fine balance between helping the Government achieve its socioeconomic objectives while ensuring the enterprise’s financial viability. This challenge stems from the engagement of SOEs in the provisioning of essential products and services, which are sometimes not commercially viable; for instance, the provision of public transport to rural communities or electricity in geographically challenging areas such as in mountainous regions. Despite this element of ‘essentiality’ associated with the portfolio of goods and services provided by Sri Lanka’s SOEs, establishing a cost reflective pricing mechanism is a key priority to ensure sustainable and uninterrupted provisioning of these goods and services.

In the recent past, Sri Lanka has struggled with the implementation of cost reflective pricing policies, especially in relation to the pricing of fuel products and utilities such as water and electricity. Despite a brief episode of frequent price adjustments of fuel products in line with global developments, no price revisions were undertaken between September 2019 and June 2021, after which three rounds of upward price revisions were undertaken to compensate for both the rising global prices of crude oil and the financial losses incurred by the CPC over several years. Tariffs for water and electricity continue to remain unrevised since 2012 and 2014, respectively. It must be reiterated that, in the case of enterprises such as the CPC and the CEB that rely on imported intermediate goods, their exposure to changes in global commodity prices as well as exchange rate fluctuations warrants regular price revisions. Hence, long periods of unchanged prices or tariffs are unacceptable as evidently losses on account of these external shocks cannot be absorbed by the relevant enterprises.

Accordingly, the implementation of transparent and depoliticised pricing rules are an urgent need. While subsidised prices may provide some financial benefits and leeway to consumers in the short term, it should be recognised that the related expenditure burden of below cost provisioning is borne by the Government. Subsidised prices cause price distortions and misallocation of resources that entail significant macroeconomic costs which could translate into insurmountable disruptions in the economy, as depicted by the power and energy crisis that emerged in early 2022. A cost reflective pricing mechanism will also ensure that SOEs pass on benefits of lower costs to consumers in a transparent and timely manner without negative implications on bottom line profits. Such a mechanism can greatly boost transparency and accountability of SOEs with positive spillover effects across the economy.

b. Improvement of Strategic Direction

The primary task of SOEs is not just to generate financial returns to the Government in the short term but also to deliver strategic value to all stakeholders of the economy by facilitating and uplifting their productive potential and overall wellbeing. Accordingly, it is imperative for

FISCAL POLICY AND GOVERNMENT FINANCE

not only from domestic developments but also global developments. The poor strategic planning of SOEs is evident from the supply side shocks that the economy is experiencing in the wake of adverse developments in global energy and food commodity prices and the lack of any robust buffers to tide over such volatilities.

Therefore, to improve strategic direction, it is important for SOEs to minutely assess their operations. Breaking down the entire value chain of a product or service can enable enterprises to assess the areas in which they have natural advantages. Private sector participation can, therefore, be facilitated through such unbundling of activities. Accordingly, operational inefficiencies are borne neither by the Government nor consumers nor other relevant stakeholders.

c. Enhancement of Financial Transparency and Accountability

SOEs are often under pressure to be competitive and commercially viable, while trying to fulfil non-commercial objectives, the latter of which may necessitate compromising financial performance. In order to keep track of whether SOEs are effectively balancing their social obligations with their commercial obligations, it is important to establish a sound performance monitoring framework that incorporates principles of accountability, transparency and governance.

In this regard, one of the key aspects that is urgently needed is the identification and development of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure and evaluate results of SOEs. While such KPIs should assess financial results, it is also important to consider the impact on social, human and environmental capitals as SOEs have a wider purpose than simply being profit generators for the Government.

Another aspect that needs to be addressed is the improvement of disclosure and transparency of SOEs. Accordingly, SOEs must observe high standards and be subject to the same high quality accounting, disclosure, compliance, and auditing standards as listed companies. Time and again, concerns have been raised that numerous SOEs do not prepare year-end financial statements or annual progress reports in a timely manner; some entail delays of several years. A stringent mechanism is essential to ensure timely periodic reporting with disclosures of financial and nonfinancial information to assess the status of SOEs and whether they are performing in a financially viable and economically sustainable manner.

d. Strengthening Corporate Governance

The success of SOEs hinges on efficient and professional management by a competent Board. The Board needs to take full responsibility for stewardship and performance of the enterprise and should be competent enough to steer it in a strategic manner that is conducive to the vision of the Government and thereby, the progress of the economy. Inefficiencies on the part of the Board can result in a lack of strategic direction leading to the colossal mismanagement of state resources, as has been seen in the case of certain SOEs in Sri Lanka.

these entities to have a transparent and unambiguous strategy that is well connected to the overall vision of the Government. This will ensure a clear purpose and mission for SOEs.

As seen in the recent past, SOEs have been unable to leverage their resources to create value for stakeholders and catalyse growth. This has been evidenced by the lack of strategic planning causing bottlenecks in the economy wherein SOEs have often failed to proactively identify and address opportunities and challenges emanating,

The composition of Boards plays a crucial role in the quality of corporate governance. It is vital that the Government promotes the appointment of competent, experienced and professional individuals to Boards to ensure strong accountability. Appointments should be on the basis of fixed term contracts that are independent of election cycles. This can ensure efficacious strategic planning suited for transformation over the medium term rather than the implementation of transient fixes.

It is also essential that Boards and the senior management of SOEs act diligently and with extreme care considering that the resources entrusted to them are ultimately the resources of the general public. The recent issuance of Guidelines on Corporate Governance and an Operational Manual for State Owned Enterprises in late 2021 by the Ministry of Finance is a timely initiative in this regard. Rigorous monitoring on the part of the Ministry of Finance to ensure that all SOEs are operating in line with these guidelines can catalyse the transformation process of these entities. Regular reviews of the guidelines are also necessary to continuously align SOE corporate governance standards in line with best international practices.

Good corporate governance helps to operate SOEs more efficiently, improve access to capital, and mitigate risk while safeguarding against mismanagement. Research findings reveal several direct advantages for SOEs that have undergone governance reforms. Such benefits include improved operational performance, increased access to alternative sources of financing through domestic and international capital markets, financing for infrastructure development, reduced fiscal burden of SOEs and increased net contribution to the budget through higher dividend payments, and reduced corruption and improved transparency.

Reforms in SOEs: International Experiences

Countries across the world have made attempts across several decades to turnaround the performance of their SOEs. Selected SOE reform experiences, as could be pertinent to Sri Lanka, are described below.

Singapore

In the case of Singapore, the investment holding company Temasek has seen much success. It was established in 1974 to own and commercially manage investments and assets previously held by the Government of Singapore. Following independence in 1965, the lack of raw natural resources drove Singapore to commence an aggressive industrialisation and economic development programme. As the Government established startups in several strategic sectors, Temasek was established to relieve relevant ministries from the commercial management of these enterprises in which the Government had a controlling stake. With time, the fund encouraged portfolio companies to expand into other markets as well as to pursue mergers and acquisitions to become more internationally competitive. Revisions to the charter over several rounds led Temasek to evolve into a global investment company with the mission of generating sustainable returns beyond the present

generation. The portfolio value of Temasek stood at US dollars 283 billion as at end March 2021, having generated a group net profit of US dollars 42 billion during the same year. Notably, there are no government representatives on the Boards of portfolio companies under Temasek. Further, the Government of Singapore does not have any influence over the appointment of key personnel and operations of Temasek or other SOEs.

China

China’s SOEs have seen a series of reforms since the 1970s, driven by market oriented economic reforms aimed at opening up the economy to foreign trade. In 2003, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) was established to fund and regulate SOEs. From 2013 onwards, China focused on the merging of large SOEs and expanded mixed ownership programmes. Currently, China’s SOE reform agenda is focused on making SOEs ‘stronger, better and bigger’. Accordingly, SASAC’s zhuada fangxiao (grasp the big, release the small) approach seeks to reduce the number of small SOEs through privatisation and asset sales, while strengthening SOEs that are deemed to be strategically important for the state economy. It is opined that the companies held by SASAC have superior governance even in comparison to their private sector counterparts. Chief Executive Officers and Directors are appointed under performance based contracts with detailed dividend targets. Boards also comprise professional independent Directors to improve accountability.

Brazil

Despite grappling with underperforming SOEs, Brazil has created extremely successful SOEs such as Petrobras which is featured on the Fortune Global 500 list. In 2010, Petrobras was transformed from a purely state owned company into a mixed company. To date, the share democratisation that ensued this transformation is one of the largest capital-increase transactions in the history of capital markets. This created an increase in the market value of the company, while creating opportunities for the company to mobilise investments to support its growth. Listing of the company on the stock exchange also paved way for significantly improved corporate governance as the state’s participation as a sole proprietor was significantly curbed, thereby preventing the risk of political influence and lack of commitment by the board and management.

India

India has followed a strategy of disinvestment in recent years to address the issue of inefficient SOEs. This has entailed the sale of a substantial portion of the government shareholding of enterprises, including transfer of management control. Today, India has the second largest number of SOEs, after China, in the Fortune Global 500 list of companies. A recent move in its reform agenda has been the privatisation of Air India with the government of India receiving about US dollars 360 million in equity and a private conglomerate taking over US dollars 2 billion of debt. India is also to establish

Successful SOE Turnaround in Sri Lanka:Case of Sri Lanka Telecom PLC

The telecommunications sector is one of the most successful service sectors in Sri Lanka, in terms of quality, reliability and pricing of services. Today, Sri Lanka boasts mobile penetration of over 135 per cent and has one of the lowest mobile and internet charges in the region. A key player in this industry is Sri Lanka Telecom PLC which has emerged as a successful SOE over the last two decades.

Following economic liberalisation, in the early 1980s Sri Lanka took a significant step in restructuring the telecommunications sector by instituting the Department of Telecommunications, which later handed over the operational functions to a public corporation, namely Sri Lanka Telecom. In 1996, Sri Lanka Telecom was reconstituted as a government owned Limited Liability Company. A turning point for the SOE was the sale of 25 per cent of the share capital to Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corporation for US dollars 225 million in the following year. This was followed by the successful listing of Sri Lanka Telecom PLC on the Colombo Stock Exchange in 2003. As at end 2020, the two major shareholders of Sri Lanka Telecom PLC were the Government, holding a 49.50 per cent stake through the Secretary to the Treasury and, Global Telecommunications Holdings N.V. with a 44.98 per cent stake and the remainder being held by other shareholders and publicly traded on the Colombo Stock Exchange. Accordingly, dividends from Sri Lanka Telecom stood at approximately Rs. 947 million in 2020 and dividends amounting to Rs. 1.4 billion are expected in 2022 and beyond.

The case of Sri Lanka Telecom highlights the innate potential that exists in SOEs and how the undertaking of timely reforms, such as through divestiture can help the economy harness this potential. It is also important to note that in this case, the setting up of the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka as an independent regulator facilitated the progress of Sri Lanka Telecom as it ensured the overall dynamic development of the sector through the creation of a regulatory environment that is committed towards ensuring competition and contestability.

Considering the success seen with Sri Lanka Telecom, going forward, the Government may consider the sale and/or divestiture of SOEs. In this regard, it is vital for successive governments to maintain a consistent policy stance in relation to the sale of government assets, while also addressing the concerns of stakeholders in a timely and proactive manner during such processes.

Way Forward

Going forward, as Sri Lanka progresses on its post COVID-19 recovery journey and transitions to the upper middle income status, it is crucial that the Government

expeditiously implements the reforms that are underway, especially in relation to mergers and consolidation and the strengthening of corporate governance, which have also been proposed above. Reforms relating to the implementation of a transparent pricing mechanism, improvement of strategic direction and enhancement of financial accountability are also imperative to improve the performance of SOEs in the short term. These not only ensure improved government revenue but also reduces the need for loss financing through budget transfers or as borrowings from the banking system. This can help release substantial volumes of resources to be channeled to more productive income generation or asset creation by households and enterprises. Accordingly, there will be a multiplier effect on government revenue in the short run and on growth in the medium to long run.

With due consideration to the key role that SOEs play in the economic development process, especially with their wide presence in strategic sectors, it is crucial that these enterprises perform effectively and deliver favourable socioeconomic outcomes without financially burdening the state. In this regard, the Government must conduct individual feasibility studies of SOEs and initiate timely action regarding the sale of some of their assets to domestic or foreign entities. Subsequently, the Government may also consider restrategizing these SOEs without politicizing them to ensure sustainable and viable operations. The Government must also recognise that although such reforms may require some unpopular policy initiatives at the outset, these can pave way for the creation of SOEs that are financially viable and economically beneficial over the medium to long run. The transformation of existing SOEs from ‘fiscal burdens’ and into ‘value creators,’ through such reforms, is vital for them to emerge as facilitators of Sri Lanka’s progress onto a high growth trajectory, rather than serve as stumbling blocks.

6.5 Budgetary Operations in Sub National Governments

Policy Directions and Measures taken by Sub National Governments

During 2021, several projects were

implemented at the sub national government

level with the aim of regional infrastructure

development and public sector service delivery

enhancement, thereby upgrading living

standards of the people.5 Accordingly, several

infrastructure related projects were implemented

during the year, including the Local Government

Enhancement Sector Project, Construction of Rural

Bridges Project, Rural Infrastructure Development

Project in Emerging Regions (RIDEP Project),

Provincial Road Development Project (PRDP),

Greater Colombo Waste Water Management

Project, and Local Development Support Project

(LDSP). Meanwhile, the Primary Health Care

System Strengthening Project and the General

Education Modernisation Programme were also in

progress in 2021 with the objective of raising the

quality of health and education service delivery at

the sub national government level.

With the view to achieving a balanced

regional development and shared prosperity

in the country, the Finance Commission

(FC) recommended several measures to be

implemented in 2021, with funds allocated

from the National Budget, in the areas of

balanced regional development, inter-agency

coordination, devolved revenue generation,

and private sector participation. The FC

recommended allocating sufficient funds to

Provincial Councils (PCs) to accomplish their

expenditure needs including delivery of services in

terms of education and health at the sub national

level. Further, recommendations were made

to ensure the effective utilisation of resources

and to reduce regional disparities by disbursing

funds directly to PCs, preparing a consolidated

annual implementation plan for development

activities, and maintaining a balanced resource

allocation among PCs. As most of the disaster

response and mitigation activities and community

based interventions are channeled through PCs

and Local Authorities (LAs), the Commission

recommended allocating a special grant to PCs

under the National Budget for delivery of services

for LAs and for environment protection activities. In

line with this recommendation, the FC highlighted

the need to discontinue the allocations for other

ministries and departments on such activities.

Moreover, the FC recommended empowering PCs

and LAs with higher revenue generation in order

to reduce the dependency of PCs and LAs on the

central government budget. The FC recommended

establishing a common framework for planning,

budgeting, and reporting of public investments

in the national and sub national governments

to strengthen the intergovernmental financial

coordination. The recommendations were also

made to encourage private investments in the

relevant sectors and regions to enhance the quality

of delivery of services, while maintaining balanced

development in the country, while posing less of a

burden on the government budget.

Budgetary Operations in Provincial Councils

Revenue collection of PCs improved in 2021,

reflecting the increased economic activities

during the year compared to 2020. Total revenue

of PCs increased to Rs. 58.1 billion in 2021 from

Rs. 52.2 billion in 2020 due to the increase in tax

revenue collection. Tax revenue increased to

Rs. 51.1 billion in 2021 from Rs. 43.1 billion in 2020

due to higher revenue collection from stamp duty,

which continued to be the key source of revenue

of PCs and increased to Rs. 38.8 billion in 2021

compared to Rs. 27.4 billion in 2020. However,

revenue earned from license fees declined to

Rs. 10.8 billion in 2021 in comparison to Rs.11.2

billion recorded in 2020, mainly due to the reduction

in motor vehicle registrations amidst the prevailing

import restrictions. With the removal of NBT in

December 2019, NBT revenue transferred from

the Central Government declined significantly

to Rs. 0.3 billion in 2021 compared to Rs. 2.7

billion recorded in 2020. Accordingly, the share of

revenue from stamp duty on tax revenue of PCs

increased to 76.0 per cent in 2021 from 63.5 per

cent in 2020, while the share of revenue from NBT

on tax revenue of PCs declined to 0.5 per cent

in 2021 from 6.3 per cent in 2020. Meanwhile,

non tax revenue declined to Rs. 7.1 billion in 2021

from Rs. 9.1 billion in 2020. Revenue in all other

provinces declined during 2021 in comparison to

the previous year, except the Western Province.

Accordingly, the share of revenue of the Western

Provincial Council out of the total revenue collection

by all PCs increased to 53.6 per cent in 2021 from

46.8 per cent in 2020 due to increased revenue

collection from stamp duty and interest income.

Among other PCs, the North Western and Southern

Provinces accounted for 10.3 per cent and 10.0 per

cent of the total revenue, respectively.

The total expenditure of PCs increased

mainly due to the rise in recurrent expenditure in

2021 compared to the preceding year. In nominal

terms, total expenditure increased to Rs. 376.4 billion

in 2021 from Rs. 337.0 billion in 2020, while as a

percentage of GDP, it broadly remained unchanged

at 2.2 per cent in 2021. Recurrent expenditure

increased to Rs. 317.0 billion in 2021 from Rs. 289.7

billion in 2020, mainly due to the rise in expenditure

on personal emoluments, which increased to

Rs. 251.5 billion in 2021 from Rs. 228.6 billion in

2020. Personal emoluments remained the largest

component of recurrent expenditure accounted for

about 79.4 per cent in the total recurrent expenditure

of PCs. Meanwhile, about 90 per cent of personal

emoluments of PCs were spent on the education and

health sectors. The Western, Central and Southern

PCs remained the highest spending authorities

accounting for 20.6 per cent, 12.8 per cent, and

12.5 per cent of total recurrent expenditure of PCs.

Meanwhile, capital expenditure of PCs increased to

Rs. 59.5 billion in 2021 from Rs. 47.3 billion in 2020,

mainly due to the rise in expenditure in relation to

special projects.

Despite the higher revenue collection of

PCs, transfers from the Central Government

to PCs increased significantly to meet higher

expenditure incurred by the PCs during the

year. Accordingly, transfers from the Central

Government to PCs increased by 11.8 per cent to

Rs. 318.3 billion in 2021, mainly due to the increase

in block grants and grants for special projects.

Transfers from the Central Government remained

at 1.9 per cent of GDP in 2021, unchanged from

2020. Block grants to PCs amounted to Rs. 284.6

billion during 2021, representing 89.4 per cent of

the total transfers. In addition, grants for special

projects increased to Rs. 18.5 billion in 2021 from

Rs. 6.4 billion in 2020. During 2021, the transfers

under the Province Specific Development

Grants and Criteria Based Grants amounted to

Rs. 12.6 billion and Rs. 2.6 billion, respectively.

At the same time, during the period under review,

about 84.6 per cent of expenditure of PCs was

financed through central government transfers

reflecting the necessity of building regional level

strategies that encourage revenue mobilisation

within PCs to reduce the pressure on the budget of

the Central Government. It may also be noted that the

continuation of an enlarged local and provincial

government system has been a significant financial

burden on the central government budget. It is

suggested that a strict governance code

to be implemented within the provincial

and local government system, ensuring

accountability and public scrutiny over their

finances.

7.1 OverviewT

he Central Bank reversed its accommodative monetary policy stance in 2021 to contain the build-up of inflationary pressures and address the imbalances on the external front. The monetary policy support extended by the Central Bank during the pandemic, continued into most of 2021 causing market interest rates to decline to historically low levels, while facilitating the funding needs of the Government and the private sector to support the economy in its phase of recovery. Accordingly, credit to both the public and private sectors expanded considerably underpinned by the abundance of low cost funds, thereby causing the expansion of broad money supply. With the aim of preempting any build-up of excessive inflationary pressures over the medium term and addressing imbalances in the external sector and financial markets, the Central Bank decided to increase policy interest rates and the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) applicable on all rupee deposit liabilities of Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) in August 2021. Along with monetary tightening, foreign loan repayments of the Government using gross official reserves, and increased currency in circulation caused a reduction in liquidity in the domestic money market. Triggered by such tight policy measures, short term market interest rates adjusted upwards followed by a gradual increase in other market interest rates, including yields on government securities that were also allowed to increase supported by the removal of maximum yield rates for acceptance on government securities auctions in the primary market. With challenges emanating from the external sector and inflation fronts, particularly considering the breach of the achievement of 12 consecutive years of single digit inflation, measures were taken to further tighten the monetary policy stance during the first quarter of 2022 to contain underlying demand pressures in the economy and anchor inflation expectations. The restrictive policy measures included the raising of policy interest rates, easing of caps on domestic lending rates, removal of caps on foreign currency deposit rates and raising of rates relevant to concessional mortgage-backed housing loans. Following the sharp depreciation of the rupee and the sustained rise in global commodity prices, sharp upward adjustments to domestic prices were observed posing substantial upside risks to inflation. In response, the Central Bank significantly tightened its stance on monetary policy in April 2022 by raising its policy interest rates by 700 basis points, the highest single-day adjustment in recent history, while removing almost all caps imposed on lending products. Such policy response, along with the expected suppression of import demand following the rupee depreciation and the anticipated improvements in supply conditions of key commodities globally, is expected to arrest the build-up of underlying demand pressures in the economy, thereby restoring price and economic stability over the medium term.

7.2 Monetary Policy Stance

The Central Bank, which continued to

provide unprecedented monetary stimulus

since the onset of the pandemic to support

economic activity and the government

cashflow, commenced tightening its monetary

policy stance since August 2021 with the

aim of preempting the build-up of excessive

inflationary pressures beyond desired levels

in the economy and addressing imbalances

in the external sector and financial markets.

The continuation of the extraordinary monetary

policy accommodation during the first half of

2021 was required to contain the impact of the

multiple waves of the COVID-19 pandemic since

early 2020, which severely disrupted economic

activity. The ultra accommodative monetary policy

stance of the Central Bank and the large infusion

of liquidity to the domestic money market brought

most market interest rates to their historic lows

during 2021, thereby reducing the cost of funds

for both private and public sectors. Accordingly,

credit to the private sector remained robust

supporting the recovery of economic activity.

Credit to the public sector, particularly net credit

to the Government from the banking system,

including the monetary financing from the Central

Bank, expanded substantially during the year. The

Central Bank provided financial support to the

Government by way of purchasing a significant

amount of Treasury bills from the primary market,

as well as direct allocations of Treasury bills to

the Central Bank to meet the emergency funding

needs of the Government amidst disruptions to

its cashflows due to lower than expected revenue

mobilisation and high expenditure. The resultant

expansion in domestic credit caused broad

money aggregates to remain elevated, although

its expansion was moderated by the notable

decline in net foreign assets (NFA) of the banking

system during 2021. As some signs of imbalances

in the economy were witnessed, particularly the

build-up of demand pressures and pressures

in the external sector and financial markets,

the Central Bank was compelled to commence

tightening monetary and liquidity conditions during

the second half of 2021 with a view to stabilising

the overall macroeconomy. Accordingly, the

policy interest rates of the Central Bank, i.e.,

the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and

the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) were

raised by 50 basis points each in mid-August 2021

to 5.00 per cent and 6.00 per cent, respectively.

The Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) was also

increased by 2 percentage points to 4.0 per cent

effective September 2021 causing an absorption of

Rs. 170 billion from the banking system, alongside

several other measures. In addition, due to tight

liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market,

interest rates offered by some banks for foreign

currency deposits increased notably, requiring the

Central Bank to impose a ceiling on interest rates

offered for foreign currency deposit products of

Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) and National

Savings Bank (NSB) in August 2021 to address

the anomalies between interest rates of rupee and

foreign currency deposits. Following the tightening

of the monetary policy stance, overall liquidity in

the domestic money market turned into large deficit

levels, resulting in a gradual upward adjustment in

the market interest rates structure.

However, with inflation continuing to

accelerate beyond desired levels amidst

sustained pressures in the external sector along

with the accommodative fiscal policy stance, the

monetary policy measures adopted in August

2021 turned more hawkish in 2022. Accordingly,

policy interest rates were increased by 150 basis

points, in aggregate, during the period from January

to March 2022, thereby containing the expansion

of money and credit, which also fuel demand for

imports, while also preventing the possible build-up

of adverse inflationary expectations amidst the

continued rise in prices generated by unfavourable

supply side developments. Reflecting the impact of

tightened monetary policy and the revisions to the

other regulatory measures, market interest rates

commenced adjusting upwards gradually. The

maximum interest rate imposed on foreign currency

deposits of LCBs and NSB was eased in December

2021 allowing to reflect prevailing market conditions

and subsequently removed in March 2022.

Further, the interest rate applicable on the special

mortgage-backed housing loan scheme for salaried

employees introduced in December 2020 was also

revised. In addition, caps imposed in August 2020

on interest rates of domestic lending products

were revised upwards in March 2022. Although

monetary policy was systematically tightened to

contain inflationary pressures in the economy, the

significant depreciation of the rupee, which along

with the sustained rise in global commodity prices,

particularly international crude oil prices, led to

immediate sharp upward adjustments in domestic

prices, thereby posing substantial upside risks to

inflation. Having identified the need to counter the

effects of such inflationary pressures and pre-empt

the escalation of adverse inflationary expectations

among other concerns, the Central Bank decided

to further tighten its stance on monetary policy in

rates by 700 basis points, the highest single-

day adjustment in recent history, along with the

decision to remove almost all caps imposed on

lending products. Supported by these measures,

market interest rates are expected to increase

notably thus discouraging excessive consumption

and encouraging savings. This would enable the

easing of underlying demand pressures in the

economy as well as expectations, thereby aiding

to retrace inflation back to the desired single digit

levels over the medium term, thus ensuring overall

macroeconomic stability.

The Central Bank conducted its

communication policy in 2021 principally to

publicise accurate information on Central

Bank actions to shape expectations and the

behaviour of economic agents, with a view to

supporting economic stability in the near term

amidst multiple external challenges to the

economy. In this regard, the Central Bank used

conventional communication channels as well as

social media and digital platforms to disseminate

information in an opportune manner. The year

began with the unveiling of the ‘Road Map: Monetary

and Financial Sector Policies for 2021 and Beyond’

in early 2021 that enunciated monetary policy and

financial sector policies for the medium term. With

the intensification of challenges and mounting

uncertainties, the Central Bank presented ‘The

Six-Month Road Map for Ensuring Macroeconomic

and Financial System Stability’ in October 2021 with

a view to strengthening the economy and delivering

macroeconomic stability by providing an assurance

to the market based on a three-pronged framework.

The Central Bank continued to communicate the

monetary policy stance during the year focusing on

guiding the market, which was accompanied with

medium term projections as relevant, to anchor

stakeholder expectations. Amidst intermittent

restrictions on social distancing, the Central Bank

continued to conduct online sessions of monetary

policy press conferences, while also having regular

in-person sessions whenever possible. In addition

to live streaming of such occasions via social media,

the Central Bank took necessary measures to issue

press releases, conduct webinars, seminars and

interviews on a frequent basis in three languages

emphasising its policies for stability and enhancing

awareness of stakeholders. Further, even amidst

the challenges posed by the pandemic situation,

the regular trilingual publications of the Central

Bank, including the Annual Report and the Recent

Economic Developments, were released. The

Central Bank also kept up with the publication of

key macroeconomic statistics on its official website

in daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly frequencies.

7.3 Developments in Inflation

Headline inflation accelerated in 2021 driven

mainly by global and domestic supply side

disturbances, the surge in global commodity

prices, upward revisions to administered

prices, while also reflecting gradually firmed

up demand pressures amidst increased

disposable incomes. Headline inflation,

as measured by the year-on-year change in

the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI,

2013=100) and the National Consumer Price Index

(NCPI, 2013=100), which remained at relatively

low levels at the beginning of the year, accelerated

thereafter driven by the acceleration of food

inflation as well as non-food inflation. The elevated

food inflation was mostly due to supply side

disruptions owing to pandemic related restrictions

and the drop in production of certain food items

(rice, vegetables, etc.). Further, extensive rise

in global prices of oil, gas and certain other

commodities led to several upward revisions in

domestic prices of goods and services. With the

effects of sudden price adjustments spilling over to

other sectors along with the removal of Maximum

Retail Prices as a method of absorbing external

price shocks, both food inflation and non-food

inflation accelerated notably during the latter part of

2021. Moreover, the rise in non-food inflation was

fuelled by the increase in expenditure of categories

such as health due to pandemic related high-cost

driven factors. Accordingly, following an era of

12 consecutive years of single digit inflation,

year-on-year headline inflation based on the CCPI

accelerated to 12.1 per cent by end 2021 from

4.2 per cent at end 2020. Annual average inflation

also rose to 6.0 per cent in 2021 from 4.6 per cent

recorded in 2020. Following a similar trend,

year-on-year headline inflation based on the NCPI

also accelerated to 14.0 per cent by end 2021

from 4.6 per cent at end 2020. Annual average

inflation based on the NCPI was recorded at

7.0 per cent in 2021 compared to 6.2 per cent

recorded in the previous year. The acceleration

of inflation continued in early 2022 as well with

year-on-year headline inflation based on the CCPI

recording 18.7 per cent in March 2022, while that

of NCPI accelerating to 17.5 per cent in February

2022.

Reflecting the lagged effect of significant

monetary accommodation, core inflation,

which measures the underlying demand driven

component of inflation, also followed an upward

trend in the second half of 2021. The year-on-year

core inflation which remained at moderate levels

at the beginning of 2021 accelerated thereafter.

Although volatile food, energy and transport

categories are excluded when measuring core

inflation, several upward price revisions made to

certain other food items such as milk powder, bread

Introduction

Central banks are concerned about maintaining low and stable inflation, i.e., price stability, which is their prime objective. By design, monetary policy is biased towards acting to arrest excessive inflation and hence protecting the purchasing power of the public, particularly the poor, as inflation disproportionately harms low income and fixed income earners. With concerted policy efforts and continuous improvements to monetary policymaking, including the adoption of an inflation targeting framework, global inflation witnessed a clear downward trend in the last several decades. However, frequent high inflation episodes were witnessed globally as well as domestically due to several reasons. Having a comprehensive analysis of such recent events is vital for appropriate policy responses, which would be beneficial in encountering such episodes in the future and mitigating adverse implications.

High Inflation Episodes in History

Even though global inflation was on a downward trend in the aftermath of World War II, there have been occasional high inflation episodes in some countries due to the elimination of price controls, supply shortages, pent-up demand, and policy mistakes in some circumstances. Literature provides for different trends and characteristics of the movements in global inflation over time, based on different classes of economies (Figure B 8.1).

Aggravated pressures on the US dollar due to large monetary expansion in the late 1960s as led by gold convertibility began to cause inflationary pressures on the economy and this spread to the rest of the world via the

BOX 8A Review of Recent Global Inflation Episodes

balance of payments deficit of the country. This is referred to as the beginning of “The Great Inflation” and resulted in the collapse of the Bretton Woods Agreement1 by the early 1970s, along with the suspension of dollar convertibility to gold by the authorities of the United States. However, extended by the oil price surge in 1973 with the formation of an embargo by the Organisation of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC), global median consumer price inflation peaked in 1974. Advanced economies responded to the price shock by monetary policy tightening and as a result, inflation tended to decline only in mid-1980s as policy transmission was disturbed by another surge in oil prices in the early 1980s, which was caused by the Iranian Revolution and subsequent Iran-Iraq War. Accordingly, median consumer price inflation in advanced economies, which was at double digit levels in 1974 declined to lower single digits by 1986 and assured the central bank credibility even amidst threats of deep recessions. This was reflected in the quadrupled interest rates in the United States within the five years from 1976 to 1981, which in turn resulted in a sharp contraction of the output between early 1981 and 1982. Some advanced economies in Europe also responded to this peak in inflation in a more stringent manner. The success of this containment of inflation during the period known as “The Great Moderation” is greatly attributed to the stabilisation of the macroeconomy through policy measures. It was characteristic for most of the countries who witnessed high inflation to adopt inflation targeting as their policy framework, resulting in global disinflation with lesser volatility. However, emerging markets and developing economies, and low income countries experienced a delayed correction of the high inflation rates which in general started in the mid-1990s. This was mostly due to structural issues in their economies such as the populist political culture, persistent and substantial fiscal and current account deficits, which sometimes existed in parallel to fixed exchange rate regimes, deteriorating terms of trade for commodity exporters, and supply side issues compared to industrial economies. Efforts to contain inflation in these economies also resulted in serious output losses during the period from 1989 to 1994, amidst civil wars, in some cases.

1 In July 1944, delegates from 44 countries met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, United States to agree on the Bretton Woods System, where gold was determined as the basis for the United States dollar and other currencies were pegged to the United States dollar value.

PeriodReasons for High Inflation

1973 - 1982Two oil price surges; first due to an embargo by the Organisation of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC), and second due to the decline in oil production caused by the Iranian Revolution and Iran-Iraq War.

2008Global demand driven factors, including increased food prices and tripled oil prices during the period from 2004 to 2008 which was also contributed by the spillover effects of extra loose monetary policy conditions in the United States.

Current episode (since 2021)COVID-19 pandemic related disruptions to supply chains, increased energy and commodity prices, increased fertiliser prices, disturbances due to elevated geopolitical tensions and reviving demand conditions due to normalising activity.

The downward trend in global inflation discontinued for a while in the early 2000s until economies were heading towards the Global Financial Crisis, when global energy prices and food prices were soaring. This was particularly due to rapid growth in emerging and developing economies that relied mostly on commodity-intensive economic growth. Strong demand persistently pushed energy prices and food prices upward until they collapsed with the financial crisis. The energy price surge was mostly driven by sluggish supply performances where the production and distribution capacity were slow to build-up as a response to rapidly increasing demand. Food prices also contributed to the prevailing high inflation, alongside demand from emerging and developing economies, and a number of other factors, including unfavourable weather conditions and growing use of export restrictions by food exporters, such as export restraints implemented by major grain exporting countries, including China, Ukraine, and Argentina.

However, in aftermath of the crisis, inflation reached low levels, where the global annual average median inflation reached 2.6 per cent by 2017. Particularly, about half of the advanced economies reported negative inflation rates in 2015, and every three out of four advanced economies reported low single digit inflation (Jongrim Ha et al., 2019). In emerging markets and developing

economies, including those that were practicing inflation targeting, disinflation was prominent, and every three out of five economies recorded inflation rates below the target level.

High Inflation Episode since 2021

The current high inflation episode appears to be far wider and more persistent than previous episodes as it was triggered by several cost driven, and demand driven factors in combination. Supply side disruptions to major commodities, including energy related and agricultural commodities, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain issues, shortage of labour and increased demand for goods and services arising from normalisation of activity from the pandemic are the key contributors to this episode. Geopolitical tensions over the Russia-Ukraine war since late February 2022 pushed inflation trajectories further up on multiple fronts stemming from uncertainty, and commodity price hikes also contributed to inflation.

Along with these supply related causes of inflation, ample policy stimuli provided by monetary and fiscal authorities across the globe as well as additional policy support from the multilateral organisations to support the economies during the pandemic appears to have fueled inflation further, causing inflation originated from supply factors to persist for longer than initially anticipated. The combined effects of these forces lead to inflation recording several folds higher than the inflation targets and historical averages in many economies, regardless of economic status. Accordingly, in 2021, global inflation reached a near 14-year high. The United States experienced the highest inflation in 40 years with a year-on-year increase in the Consumer Price Index recording 7.9 per cent in February 2022. By February 2022, recording 6.2 per cent and 5.9 per cent

increases over the last 12 months, the United Kingdom and New Zealand economies also experienced the highest level of inflation recorded in last three decades. The trend is set to continue as the leading economies, as well as the emerging market economies are expected to experience inflationary pressures in 2022 as well. Inflation in the Eurozone too mounted to a record high of about 5.0 per cent in 2021.

At the outset of the current high inflation episode, it was a widespread belief that these inflationary pressures are temporary, hence the need to respond through monetary policy would not arise as it could hamper growth recovery in the post-pandemic period. However, inflation worldwide is expected to persist for a longer period at a greater magnitude, than previously envisioned by global think tanks, due to ongoing supply chain disruptions and high energy prices. This made policymakers rethink prioritising

stability over economic growth, and most central banks from advanced, emerging and developing economies commenced unwinding policy stimuli and started adopting a hawkish stance by tightening policy interest rates sharply and communicating their commitment for further tightening through forward guidance to fight inflation. The resultant tight global financial conditions are anticipated to contain global inflation back to the desired level with a policy lag. In addition to demand side measures, some countries are seeking possibilities of implementing certain supply side measures, such as change in conventional agricultural practices expecting to maintain realistic buffer stocks and revising import policies to avoid price rises of essential commodities.

supported by appropriate fiscal policies by governments. Central banks increase policy interest rates to increase the cost of borrowings and thereby discourage aggregate consumer spending. On the fiscal front, governments reduce inflationary pressures by increasing taxes and reducing government spending to address the demand-pull inflation. Also, price controls and subsidies play a major role in minimising the cost of production in controlling cost push inflation.

More importantly, transparent and independent central banks have been able to reduce inflation at a faster rate by anchoring inflation expectations through established credibility among economic stakeholders. Numerous assessments on the impact of central bank independence on macroeconomic stability support the assertion of a negative relationship between the central bank independence and inflation (Brumm 2002, 2011; Garriga and Rodriquez 2020; Berger, de Haan, and Eijffinger 2001). Empirically, central bank transparency has also been found to help anchor inflation expectations in advanced economies, thereby stabilising inflation and reducing uncertainty in inflation. (Weber 2016). Overall, appropriate stabilisation policies such as strengthening institutions, greater autonomy in central banking, and establishing an appropriate fiscal environment help decelerate structurally persistent inflation. Moreover, such policy commitments have been instrumental in successfully handling intermittent

supply driven inflationary pressures as these pressures are perceived to be transitory by economic agents with well anchored expectations.

When investigating historical inflationary trends, it can be observed that compared to developed and emerging economies, many developing or low income countries have experienced high unvarying inflation over time. Therefore, it is a significant challenge for central banks in these countries to achieve low and stable inflation and to anchor inflation expectations. Although inflation in developing countries is more susceptible to external shocks such as energy prices and food prices, some of the reasons adduced for the sustained and persistent inflation rates in many developing countries are structural, including high budget deficits and financing such deficits by the central bank, high government expenditure, high military expenditure, low productivity, frequent weather shocks, high persistent inflation expectations by the economic agents, excess money supply and unstable exchange rates.

Figure B 8.3 shows the impact of global factors in driving inflation in domestic core inflation, which measures the underlying demand driven component of inflation, across countries.

Tight monetary and fiscal policies and control prices have helped control inflation; the impact of inflationary pressures was reduced via safety net interventions such

as cash transfers and food subsidies, at times to some extent. In many developing economies, active use of countercyclical policies including fiscal rules have aided insulation of economies from the impact of global shocks.

High Inflation Episodes in Sri Lanka

The Sri Lankan economy also has not been an exception to global inflation dynamics, cost push factors and structural limitations in demand management. Sri Lanka, too experienced, high inflation episodes during several periods due to transitory supply side disruptions, especially weather related, and surge in international commodity prices together with the lagged effect of monetary expansion largely to support deficit financing. Nevertheless, Sri Lanka maintained low and stable levels of inflation for over a decade, abetted by continuous improvements to policy formulation and policy communication, while addressing supply concerns temporarily through government intervention by reducing certain taxes on essential commodities, importation of certain commodities, imposing maximum retail prices for certain commodities, even within the limited fiscal space. The Central Bank has deployed monetary policy measures to contain demand driven inflationary pressures. Adopting a flexible inflation targeting (FIT) monetary policy framework aids the Central Bank to conduct monetary policy in an increasingly forward looking manner with the aim of maintaining inflation at low and stable levels in the medium term, thereby supporting to attain sustainable economic growth while ensuring Central Bank transparency and accountability. Since FIT involves the aim of achieving the envisaged inflation targets, which can be closely monitored through inflation forecasts, the monetary policy decision making process is facilitated by a forward looking model based comprehensive analysis on the deviations of the inflation forecasts from the desired targets. Therefore, shocks to such deviations can be addressed through proactive policy measures in a timely manner to bring inflation back to the desired target levels, while properly anchoring inflation expectations.

Similar to many countries across the globe, Sri Lanka is currently experiencing high levels of inflation. In addition to COVID-19 provoked circumstances, the recent acceleration in inflation was driven by supply

side factors stemming from international commodity prices, which include fuel and some essential imported commodities. The removal of price controls and their spillover effects and the buildup of demand driven inflationary pressures stemming from pandemic related policy stimulus measures also contributed to inflation. Reflecting growing pressures from underlying demand conditions, core inflation, which does not capture volatile food prices, energy and transport costs, witnessed an increasing trend similar to other countries. Such demand driven pressures are taken care of through proactive policy measures taken by the Central Bank and the policy communication to reiterate commitment to revert inflation to the targeted range at the earliest. As such, the Central Bank increased policy rates in an aggressive manner, while devising preemptive policies to ensure that inflation returns to the targeted level at the fastest possible pace with minimal disruptions to economic recovery. Nonetheless, the government’s intervention also remains vital to overwhelm the supply side concerns, while enabling monetary policy driven measures to arrest excessive inflationary pressure in the economy, and hence robust and coordinated policies are required to be adopted in a timely manner. The intervention of the Central Bank is vital to contain inflationary pressures building up from speculation by economic agents, and hence inflation expectations. It is important to have a mechanism established by the government, to detect early and take proactive policy decisions to contain any adverse inflationary developments arising from supply side disturbances. Such a policy mix is crucial for any country that wishes to quickly move back to targets to enjoy the luxury of stable and healthy levels of inflation, thereby ensuring sustainable economic growth which ensures high living standards of the public.

and bakery products, along with increases in the

prices of non-food items such as health, restaurants

and hotels, etc. contributed to the acceleration

of core inflation in the latter part of 2021. The

movements in core inflation were reflecting the

gradual build-up of demand pressures underpinned

by the significant fiscal and monetary policy stimuli

provided during the pandemic. Year-on-year

core inflation based on the CCPI accelerated from

3.5 per cent at end 2020 to 8.3 per cent by end 2021

and accelerated further to 13.0 per cent in March

2022, while annual average core inflation was at

4.4 per cent in 2021 compared to 3.1 per cent

recorded in 2020. Core inflation based on the

NCPI also accelerated from 4.7 per cent at end

2020 to 10.8 per cent, year-on-year, by end

2021 and further to 14.1 per cent in February

2022. The annual average core inflation at

5.5 per cent in 2021 compared to 4.1 per cent

recorded in 2020. The actual and anticipated

movements in core inflation prompted the Central

Bank to take preemptive monetary policy measures

to tighten monetary conditions with the view of

arresting demand driven inflationary pressures and

anchoring inflation expectations.

Inflation expectations of both the corporate

and household sectors as gauged by the

Inflation Expectations Survey of the Central

Bank, remained elevated during 2021 induced

by the movements in actual inflation. As per the

survey findings, both the corporate and household

sectors expect inflation to trend upwards in the near

term owing to supply side disturbances. Changing

global and domestic supply and demand conditions

and the pandemic related mobility restrictions,

increase in money supply, possible depreciation

of the rupee, restrictions on imports, high demand

during festive seasons, expansionary fiscal policy

stance, possible increase of fuel and gas prices,

increase in global commodity prices and imported

items, drop in domestic supply especially due to

fertiliser restrictions, and the expected recovery

in the domestic economy were the most cited

reasons by survey respondents for the increase

in inflation expectations. In view of the monetary

policy actions of the Central Bank and the resultant

increase in interest rates, during the latter part of the

year, inflation expectations of the corporate sector

for the forthcoming period followed a decreasing

trend, which also reflects improvements in supply

conditions and relaxation of import restrictions as

cited by the survey respondents.

reaching a large deficit level by end 2021.

Although the purchasing of government securities

by the Central Bank at primary market auctions and

the direct allocation of Treasury bills to the Central

Bank injected a sizeable quantum of rupee liquidity

into the domestic money market, several other

factors caused a decline in liquidity during 2021.

the public from the banking system, and maturities

of foreign currency buy-sell swaps with domestic

banks led to a continued reduction in liquidity in

the domestic money market, causing a marginal

deficit level by mid-August 2021. Liquidity in the

domestic money market further decreased with the

permanent liquidity absorption due to the increase

in SRR applicable on all rupee deposit liabilities

of LCBs by 2 percentage points to 4.0 per cent

in September 2021. At the same time, following

the tightening of the monetary policy stance by

mid-August 2021, the Central Bank commenced

open market operations to absorb excess liquidity

from the market, with the view to steering the

short term market interest rates. Meanwhile,

the Central Bank conducted long-term reverse

repo auctions, as needed, to inject liquidity on a

longer term basis to ease the liquidity stress in

some banks. Intervention in the domestic foreign

exchange market by the Central Bank to provide

foreign exchange to facilitate uninterrupted import

of essentials also caused a reduction in market

liquidity. Given these developments, daily average

liquidity in the domestic money market, that

recorded a surplus of around Rs. 137 billion during

the first half of 2021, declined to a deficit of around

Rs. 205 billion during the fourth quarter of 2021.

By end-March 2022, the deficit in overnight

liquidity in the domestic money market further

increased and reached high levels exceeding

Rs. 600 billion.

Reflecting the impact of the change in the

monetary policy stance in mid-August 2021

and large deficit liquidity levels, the Average

Weighted Call Money Rate (AWCMR), which

is the operating target of the monetary policy

framework, reached the upper bound of the

Standing Rate Corridor. The AWCMR, which

remained closer to the lower bound of the Standing

Rate Corridor at the beginning of 2021, increased

gradually towards the middle of the Standing Rate

Corridor with the gradual reduction in liquidity in the

domestic money market from the second quarter of

2021. Further, with the tightening of the monetary

policy stance commencing August 2021, the

AWCMR was allowed to adjust towards the upper

bound of the Standing Rate Corridor. Accordingly,

the AWCMR increased by around 240 basis points

since August 2021 and reached 7.49 per cent by

end-March 2022, in comparison to the cumulative

policy rate adjustment of 200 basis points since

August 2021. Meanwhile, weighted average rates

on transactions in the repo market also closely

followed the movements of the AWCMR, recording

7.50 per cent by end-March 2022.

Yields on Government Securities

Yields on government securities, which

declined notably during 2020, recorded a

significant increase during 2021 in view of

the increased borrowing requirement of

the Government, amidst the change in the

monetary policy stance and the removal of

maximum yield rates for acceptance at primary

auctions of government securities. Limited

foreign currency inflows to the Government

higher reliance of the Government to borrow from

domestic sources caused upward pressures on the

yields on government securities throughout 2021.

However, the prevalence of maximum yield rates

for acceptance at primary auctions of government

securities helped contain the increase in yields on

government securities. Nevertheless, subsequent to

the increase in policy rates in mid-August 2021, and

the removal of maximum yield rates for acceptance

at primary auctions of government securities in

mid-September 2021, a notable increase in the yields

on government securities was observed. A further

notable increase in yields was observed in early

2022, reflecting the deteriorating investor sentiment

on account of fiscal sector difficulties amidst the

large borrowing requirement of the Government and

its impact on overall economic activity, and policy

rate increases undertaken in the first quarter of 2022.

Accordingly, the primary market yields on Treasury

bills increased by a range of 723-823 basis points

across all tenures during the period from end 2020

till end-March 2022. With the removal of maximum

yield rates for acceptance at primary auctions of

government securities, market appetite increased,

and larger shares of Treasury bill issuances were

subscribed by market participants. However, the

majority of the Treasury bills that were subscribed

by the market during 2021, especially during the

latter part of the year, were from the maturity bucket

of 91 days, highlighting the preference of investors

towards short term investments amidst perceived

uncertainty. Primary market yields on Treasury

bonds issued from the beginning of 2021 till

end-March 2022 also increased by a range of

223-876 basis points across all tenures. Secondary

market yields on government securities also

recorded substantial increases across all maturities

during the same period. Accordingly, during the

period from end 2020 to end March 2022, secondary

market yields on Treasury bills increased by a range

of 740-746 basis points across all tenures, while the

increase in the secondary market yields on Treasury

bonds was in the range of 758-855 basis points.

Meanwhile, the Government raised funds through

US dollar denominated Sri Lanka Development

Bonds (SLDBs) at various fixed rates in the range

of 5.00-10.00 per cent during 2021 and 2022 till

end-March 2022.

Deposit and Lending Interest Rates

Deposit interest rates of LCBs, which

declined notably until August 2021 in response

to policy and regulatory measures taken by

the Central Bank to ease monetary conditions,

increased at a relatively slow pace following the

tightening of monetary policy in August 2021. The

Average Weighted Deposit Rate (AWDR)1 and the

1 AWDR reflects the movements in interest rates pertaining to all outstanding interest bearing rupee deposits held with LCBs.

2021. Further, the Average Weighted New Deposit

Rate (AWNDR)3 and the Average Weighted New

Fixed Deposit Rate (AWNFDR)4 also recorded their

lowest levels of 4.77 per cent in April 2021 and

4.90 per cent in May 2021, respectively. Accordingly,

the average deposit interest rates had decreased

by 345-443 basis points from 2019 onwards to

reach these lowest rates. However, following the

tightening of monetary conditions, all deposit rates

commenced increasing with AWDR increasing by 32

basis points from August 2021 through end February

2022, while AWNDR also increased by 131 basis

points during this period. It was observed that the

pace of increase in deposit interest rates was slow

compared to the increase in market lending rates.

Furthermore, some deposit products of the banking

sector recorded negative real interest rates during

the latter part of 2021 as the upward adjustment

in market deposit rates was overshadowed by the

increase in the rate of inflation.

on a downward trend due to accommodative

monetary conditions, increased rapidly towards

February 2022, AWLR across a number of security

types remained lower than the rates observed

by end 2020 despite the tightening of monetary

policy commencing August 2021, highlighting the

impact of the outstanding stock of loans and the

space available for further upward adjustment of

market lending rates, in the period ahead. When

loans to small and medium sized enterprises

(SMEs) as measured in the monthly SME Credit

Survey8 are considered, average interest rates

on loans to the SME sector by licensed banks

indicated the trend of overall average lending

rates of LCBs, but remained higher. Accordingly,

the Average Weighted SME Lending Rate

(AWSR)9 and the Average Weighted New SME

Lending Rate (AWNSR)10 reached 10.49 per cent

and 10.04 per cent, respectively, by end 2021.

In view of tightened monetary conditions, several

maximum interest rates applicable on lending

products were also revised upwards. Accordingly,

the interest rate applicable on the special

mortgage-backed housing loan scheme for

salaried employees introduced in December 2020

was changed from the fixed rate of 7 per cent per

annum for the first five years of the loan to a variable

rate linked to monthly AWPR. Further, given

tightened monetary conditions, caps imposed in

August 2020 on interest rates of domestic lending

products were revised upwards in March 2022,

where the maximum interest rate applicable to

credit cards was increased to 20 per cent per

annum; on pre-arranged temporary overdrafts

increased to 18 per cent per annum; and on

pawning facilities increased to 12 per cent per

annum, which were subsequently removed

entirely in April 2022.

somewhat. However, with the gradual increase

in interest rates on rupee denominated deposit

products following the tightening of the monetary

policy stance in August 2021, the cap for foreign

currency deposit interest rates was also revised to

better reflect market conditions and subsequently

removed in March 2022. Accordingly, interest rates

on US dollar denominated savings deposits were

in the range of 0.03-4.60 per cent by end 2021,

compared to the range of 0.03-4.00 per cent at

end 2020. Interest rates pertaining to savings

deposits denominated in pound sterling remained

unchanged in the range of 0.03-3.00 per cent by

end 2021, compared to end 2020. Meanwhile,

interest rates on time deposits denominated in

US dollars were in the range of 0.02-7.00 per cent

by end 2021, in comparison to the range of

0.10-6.00 per cent recorded at end 2020. Further,

interest rates applicable on pound sterling

denominated time deposits were in the range of

0.02-5.75 per cent by end 2021, compared to the

range of 0.05-4.25 per cent at end 2020.

7.5 Movements in Money and

Credit Aggregates

Reserve Money

Reserve money, which reflects the monetary

base of the economy, recorded a notable growth

during 2021 reflecting the increase in currency

in circulation and the impact of the increase in

the SRR. Reserve money grew by 35.4 per cent,

year-on-year, by end 2021, compared to the

expansion of 3.4 per cent recorded at end 2020.

In absolute terms, reserve money increased by

Rs. 341.4 billion during 2021 to Rs. 1,305.8 billion

by end 2021, compared to the increase of

Rs. 31.8 billion during 2020. Accordingly, currency

in circulation remained at elevated levels during the

year with high precautionary demand for currency

The Legal Rate and the Market Rate of

Interest,11 as determined by the Monetary Board

and published in the Government Gazette at

the end of each year, were at 7.48 per cent per

annum for 2022, compared to 10.12 per cent

per annum for 2021. The Legal Rate and the

Market Rate for 2022 were computed based on

simple averages of monthly AWDR and AWLR of

LCBs, which prevailed during the preceding twelve

months from November 2020 to October 2021.

Interest Rates on Foreign Currency Deposits

Reflecting the increased competition among

banks to mobilise foreign currency deposits

amidst constrained liquidity in the domestic

foreign exchange market, interest rates on

foreign currency deposits recorded a sharp

upward trend, which also required imposing

certain measures to correct anomalies between

foreign exchange and rupee interest rates. With

the recovery of the global economy along with the

support of vaccination programmes, monetary

policy in many countries commenced tightening,

mainly as a result of rising inflationary pressures. In

view of tightening global interest rates, along with

the liquidity conditions prevailing in the domestic

foreign exchange market, certain interest rates

on domestic foreign currency deposits offered

by licensed banks were notably high, thereby

creating interest rate anomalies between domestic

and foreign currency deposit products. Hence, a

maximum interest rate was imposed by the Central

Bank on foreign currency deposits interest rates of

LCBs and NSB in late August 2021 in order to iron

out such interest rate anomalies, and as a result,

foreign currency deposit interest rates, eased

11 The Legal Rate is defined under the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 6 of 1990, and is applicable to any action for the recovery of a sum of money. The Market Rate is defined under the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No. 2 of 1990, and applies only in relation to actions instituted by lending institutions for the recovery of debt exceeding Rs. 150,000 arising out of commercial transactions, where there is no agreed rate of interest.

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

by the public amidst the pandemic and associated

lockdowns and also partly reflecting the economic

activity returning to normalcy and relatively low

interest rates offered for deposits. Accordingly,

currency in circulation increased by Rs. 170.3 billion

during the year to Rs. 1,005.1 billion by end 2021,

over the Rs. 156.8 billion increase during 2020. The

large increase in money released to the economy

indicates the extra accommodative monetary policy

conducted in the eight months ending August 2021.

Meanwhile, following the upward adjustment to the

SRR by 2 percentage points in September 2021,

the deposits of LCBs maintained at the Central

Bank also increased notably. Accordingly, by end

2021, deposits of LCBs with the Central Bank

recorded a notable expansion of Rs. 171.1 billion

to Rs. 300.7 billion.

Based on the assets side of the Central Bank

balance sheet, the expansion in reserve money

was entirely due to the increase in net domestic

assets (NDA) of the Central Bank, while net

foreign assets (NFA) of the Central Bank

declined notably during 2021. The expansion in

NDA of the Central Bank was mainly on account

of the increase in the net credit to the government

(NCG), which increased by Rs. 1,225.2 billion in

2021 compared to the increase of Rs. 505.9 billion

during 2020. This reflects a substantial increase

in the Central Bank’s holdings of government

securities (net of repurchase transactions) due

to purchasing of Treasury bills at primary market

bills to the Central Bank. Accordingly, the

holdings of government securities by the Central

Bank rose substantially by Rs. 1,228.1 billion to

Rs. 1,945.4 billion during 2021. Meanwhile,

amidst the gradual recovery of economic activity,

the Central Bank’s claims on LCBs declined

with the repayment of concessionary loans that

were extended by the Central Bank through

LCBs to support pandemic hit businesses and

individuals. As a combined result, NDA of the

Central Bank increased by Rs. 1,255.4 billion

during 2021 compared to the increase of

Rs. 401.1 billion in the previous year. Meanwhile,

NFA of the Central Bank contracted notably by

Rs. 914.0 billion to negative levels during 2021.

Foreign currency assets of the Central Bank

declined during the year mainly due to the foreign

currency debt service payments by the Central

Bank on behalf of the Government, including the

repayment of the maturing repurchase agreement

of US dollars 1.0 billion with the Federal Reserve

Bank of New York in two legs in February and

March 2021, and the settlement of the International

Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) of US dollars 1.0 billion

that matured in July 2021, while foreign currency

liabilities of the Central Bank increased during this

period. In addition, the Central Bank continued to

supply foreign currency to the domestic foreign

exchange market from its international reserves

portfolio in order to facilitate the payments of

essential imports.

The money multiplier, which is the ratio

between broad money supply (M2b) and reserve

money, declined in 2021 as a result of the

significant expansion in reserve money, which

outweighed the impact of the expansion of

broad money supply (M2b). Accordingly, the money

multiplier based on broad money (M2b) decreased to

8.15 by end 2021 from 9.75 recorded at end 2020.

Meanwhile, the currency to deposits ratio increased

to 8.0 per cent by end 2021 from 7.3 per cent

recorded at end 2020, while time and savings

deposits held by the public increased comparatively

at a slower pace over the preceding year.

Broad Money (M2b) and Domestic Credit

In spite of the continued expansion of

domestic credit, the growth of broad money

supply (M2b) moderated towards the latter part

of 2021 due to the contraction in NFA of the

banking system. Accordingly, the year-on-year

growth of M2b decelerated to 13.2 per cent

by end 2021, compared to the growth of

23.4 per cent recorded at end 2020. The overall

stock of M2b increased by Rs. 1,241.6 billion

to Rs. 10,647.3 billion by end 2021, from

Rs. 9,405.7 billion level at end 2020. As the key

source of M2b, NDA of the banking system increased

by Rs. 2,014.1 billion during 2021 mainly driven by

the increase in domestic credit, while NFA of the

banking system contracted by Rs. 772.5 billion

during the year.

In terms of the liabilities side of M2b, the

increase in time and savings deposits held by

the public with LCBs largely contributed to the

monetary expansion during 2021, although a

moderation was observed compared to the

previous year. Accounting for about 77 per cent

of the expansion of M2b during the year, time

and savings deposits of LCBs increased by

Rs. 958.8 billion in 2021, compared to the

significant increase of Rs. 1,469.9 billion recorded

in 2020. The moderation in funds placed in time and

savings deposits in 2021 was due to the notable

decline in market deposit rates, thereby slowing the

year-on-year growth of time and savings deposits

of LCBs to 11.7 per cent by end 2021, compared

to 21.7 per cent at end 2020. Meanwhile, with the

resurgence of pandemic-related uncertainties in

2021, demand deposits and currency held by the

public (which reflects narrow money, M1) expanded

by Rs. 282.7 billion during the year, compared to the

increase of Rs. 311.7 billion in 2020. Accordingly,

the year-on-year growth of M1 moderated to

24.0 per cent by end 2021, compared to the notable

growth of 36.0 per cent at end 2020.

Viewed from the assets side of M2b,

continuing the trend observed during 2020,

NFA of the banking system contracted during

2021 due to the notable decline in NFA of

the Central Bank, despite the improvement

observed in NFA of LCBs. NFA of LCBs

increased by Rs. 141.5 billion during 2021 over the

increase of Rs. 59.0 billion recorded in 2020 with

the expansion in NFA of both domestic banking

units (DBUs) and offshore banking units (OBUs).

NFA of DBUs increased by Rs. 45.6 billion, mainly

on account of the considerable increase in foreign

currency placements with banks abroad despite

the increase in foreign currency liabilities in terms

of deposit liabilities of non-residents. However,

reduced conversion of funds received in the form of

workers’ remittances to the banking system could

have stifled the possible improvement in NFA of

DBUs during 2021. In the meantime, NFA of OBUs

also increased by Rs. 95.9 billion in 2021 due to

increased lending to non-residents, along with the

notable decline in foreign borrowings.

NDA of the banking system continued to

expand notably during 2021, driven by the

increase in credit to both the public and the

private sectors. Amidst limited access to foreign

financing and the decline in government revenue,

the Government’s increased funding requirement

was met largely through the domestic banking

system, mainly the Central Bank. Continuing the

trend observed in 2020, NCG by the banking

system increased notably by Rs. 1,284.4 billion

in 2021, of which around 95 per cent was funded

by the Central Bank. Accordingly, NCG from the

Central Bank increased by Rs. 1,225.2 billion

during 2021. Meanwhile, provisional advances

provided to the Government by the Central Bank

declined to Rs. 150.1 billion in December 2021

from Rs. 198.2 billion recorded in early 2021 with

the repayment of the advances by the Government

following the revised budget estimates for

2021. Meanwhile, NCG by LCBs increased by

Rs. 59.2 billion in 2021 compared to the notable

increase of Rs. 1,246.3 billion in 2020, entirely

due to the increase in NCG by DBUs, while

NCG by OBUs recorded a contraction during the

year. Accordingly, NCG by DBUs increased by

Rs. 157.6 billion mainly due to investments in long

term government securities as well as the increase

in government overdraft balances provided

by state banks. NCG by OBUs declined by

Rs. 98.5 billion, compared to the increase of

Rs. 22.3 billion recorded in the previous year, on

account of the decline in direct foreign currency

loans to the Government, maturing of ISBs held by

LCBs, and reduced appetite towards reinvesting

in SLDBs following maturity amidst the limited

availability of foreign exchange within the banking

system.

Credit obtained by the State Owned

Business Enterprises (SOBEs) from the

banking system continued to expand in 2021,

reflecting their weak financial positions and

legacy issues. Accordingly, credit obtained by

SOBEs from the banking system increased by

Rs. 185.9 billion during 2021 following an increase

of Rs. 184.2 billion in 2020. Contributing largely to

the expansion of credit obtained by the SOBEs,

in cumulative terms, bank borrowing by the

Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) increased

by Rs. 123.5 billion in 2021. Meanwhile, bank

borrowing by the Road Development Authority

(RDA) increased by Rs. 24.5 billion during 2021,

while borrowing by the State Pharmaceuticals

Corporation (SPC) increased by Rs. 14.6 billion,

reflecting the increased financial need to facilitate

pandemic related medical expenses. In addition,

credit obtained by Ceylon Fertiliser Corporation

(CFC), Cooperative Wholesale Establishment

(CWE), SriLankan Airlines, National Water Supply

& Drainage Board (NWS&DB), and Ceylon

Electricity Board (CEB) also increased notably

during 2021. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Ports Authority

(SLPA), Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) and Urban

Development Authority (UDA) made repayments to

LCBs on a net basis during the year.

Credit extended to the private sector

expanded notably during 2021, reflecting

improved economic activity, buttressed by the

low interest rate environment. Accordingly, credit

extended to the private sector by LCBs increased by

Rs. 810.5 billion during 2021, compared to the

increase of Rs. 374.1 billion during 2020. Supported

by accommodative monetary conditions, the growth

of credit extended to the private sector by LCBs

expanded gradually until August 2021 recording

an expansion of about Rs. 624.6 billion during this

period. Some moderation in the growth of credit to the

private sector has been observed thereafter reflecting

the impact of tight monetary and liquidity conditions

in the market during the latter part of 2021. Possible

loan capitalisation with the extended debt moratoria

for COVID-19 affected businesses and individuals as

well as priority sector lending targets to licensed banks,

which were imposed in April 2021 to enhance credit

flows to the SME sector, may have also contributed

to the credit expansion during the year. Year-on-year

growth of credit extended to the private sector, which

grew by 6.5 per cent by end 2020, accelerated to

15.1 per cent by August 2021, before moderating to

13.1 per cent by end 2021.

As per the Quarterly Survey of Commercial

Banks’ Loans and Advances to the Private

Sector, growth of credit to major economic

sectors gathered pace during 2021 reflecting

improved economic activity, although some

moderation was observed in the growth of

personal loans and advances towards end

2021. Overall, the increase in credit to Industry (by

Rs. 340.4 billion) and Services (by Rs. 259.3 billion)

sectors contributed around 43 per cent and

33 per cent, respectively, to the overall

expansion of credit extended to the private

sector by LCBs during 2021, while the

increase in credit to Agriculture and Fishing (by

Rs. 53.9 billion) and Personal Loans and

Advances (by Rs. 130.1 billion) contributed around

7 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively. In

terms of sectoral performance, credit to the

Agriculture and Fishing sector recorded a growth of

11.0 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2021, compared

to the moderate growth of 3.9 per cent by end

2020. Within this sector, credit flows to the Paddy,

Rubber, Coconut, Vegetable and Fruit Cultivation

and Minor Food Crops, and Fisheries subsectors

recorded expansions during the year, while credit

granted to the Tea subsector contracted marginally

during 2021. Meanwhile, witnessing the recovery in

most economic activities, the Industry and Services

sector activities improved during 2021, recording

healthy credit flows to most subsectors. Accordingly,

growth of credit to the Industry sector accelerated

to 13.4 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2021 from

4.7 per cent at end 2020. Within the Industry

sector, credit to the Construction subsector, which

accounted for around 54 per cent of the total credit

flows to the Industry sector, recorded a notable

growth of 14.5 per cent, year-on-year, by end

2021. Credit to other subsectors, namely Textiles

and Apparel, and Food and Beverages also grew

notably by end 2021. The growth of credit extended

to the Services sector accelerated to 15.1 per cent,

year-on-year, by end 2021, compared to the

growth of 1.4 per cent at end 2020. Within the

Services sector, reflecting improved trade related

activities, credit to the Wholesale and Retail Trade

subsector grew by 9.6 per cent, year-on-year, by

end 2021, compared to the marginal contraction

reported at end 2020. Reflecting increased credit

flows to the tourism sector given the extended debt

moratorium facilities and other measures to boost

the industry during the pandemic along with its

recovery, credit to the Tourism subsector expanded

considerably and recorded a year-on-year growth

of 10.1 per cent by end 2021. Further, expansion

in the Services sector credit was also supported

by lending to Financial and Business Services and

Transport subsectors. Growth of credit in the form of

Personal Loans and Advances grew moderately by

8.0 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2021, compared

to the growth of 15.1 per cent at end 2020.

Contributing to the moderate expansion, growth

of credit granted under Consumer Durables

decelerated to 13.3 per cent, year-on-year,

by end 2021 compared to the notable growth

of 38.4 per cent at end 2020. Pawning related

advances recorded a notable growth of

18.6 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2021

reflecting the increased appetite for such credit

amidst increased gold prices and disruptions to

cashflows. Credit card advances also improved by

12.0 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2021, in

comparison to the contraction of 2.5 per cent at end

2020. Further, in terms of the maturity of outstanding

credit to the private sector by LCBs, an increase was

observed in short and medium term credit, while a

slowdown was observed in long term credit facilities,

possibly reflecting tight monetary conditions in the

economy towards the end of the year.

Broad Money (M4)

Following the similar trend in M2b, the growth

of broad money supply (M4), as measured by the

Financial Survey,12 decelerated by end 2021. The

year-on-year growth of M4, gradually decelerated

to 13.3 per cent by end 2021 from a growth of

21.4 per cent recorded at end 2020. Viewed

from the assets side, the expansion of M4 was

driven entirely by the expansion in NDA, within

which domestic credit by Licensed Specialised

Banks (LSBs) increased by Rs. 259.6 billion,

while that of Licensed Finance Companies

(LFCs) rose by Rs. 103.6 billion during 2021. The

expansion of total NCG based on M4 amounted

to Rs. 1,403.6 billion during the year, of which

12 The Financial Survey provides a broader measure of liquidity, covering all deposit taking institutions, including LSBs and LFCs, in addition to LCBs and the Central Bank.

Rs. 102.3 billion was through LSBs and

Rs. 16.9 billion was through LFCs. Further,

underpinned by the low interest rate environment,

credit extended to the private sector by licensed

banks and LFCs grew by 12.7 per cent,

year-on-year in 2021, from the growth of

6.3 per cent recorded in 2020. Credit extended

by LSBs to the private sector increased by

Rs. 157.3 billion in 2021, recording an annual

growth of 16.8 per cent, year-on-year. Meanwhile,

credit extended by LFCs to the private sector rose

by Rs. 86.7 billion in 2021, marking an annual

growth of 7.4 per cent, year-on-year. However,

overall NFA of M4 contracted by Rs. 781.5 billion

during 2021, with NFA of LSBs declining by

Rs. 9.0 billion during the year due to the increase in

foreign liabilities.

On the liabilities side of M4, the growth of

time and savings deposits held by the public

with licensed banks and LFCs moderated

by end 2021. Accordingly, the growth of time

and savings deposits as per M4 moderated to

11.6 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2021, compared

to the growth of 20.0 per cent at end 2020. Time

and savings deposits held with LSBs grew by

13.5 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2021, compared

to the growth of 21.6 per cent recorded in 2020.

However, time and savings deposits held with

LFCs grew by only 5.5 per cent, year-on-year, by

end 2021, compared to the marginal contraction of

0.7 per cent recorded during 2020. While the overall

growth of time and savings deposits as per M4

moderated due to the slowdown in the mobilisation

of interest bearing deposits by the banking sector,

some improvement was observed in the time and

savings deposits mobilised by LFCs during 2021.

8.1 OverviewA

midst strong macroeconomic headwinds, the stability of the financial system was preserved during

2021. Financial intermediation by the banking sector was satisfactory, while adequate capital and

liquidity buffers were maintained. In addition, the profitability of the sector improved considerably

during 2021 compared to the previous year due to notable increases in both net interest income and non-

interest income. However, banks faced a foreign currency liquidity shortage due to several sovereign rating

downgrades and the lack of foreign inflows experienced by the country. The performance of the Licensed

Finance Companies (LFCs) and Specialised Leasing Companies (SLCs) sector recorded a considerable

improvement in terms of credit growth and profitability on an overall basis. In order to build strong and

stable LFCs in the medium term and safeguard depositors of the sector, the implementation of the Financial

Sector Consolidation Masterplan progressed during 2021. Furthermore, to ensure the flexibility in adapting

to the new normal and to provide continuous support to the COVID-19 affected economy, the Central Bank

relaxed some of the regulations pertaining to financial institutions under its purview during the period under

review. The insurance sector also recorded an expansion in terms of assets and gross written premium while

marking a marginal contraction in profits. Meanwhile, the performance of financial markets was mixed during

2021. Money market liquidity, which remained at a surplus level during the first seven months of 2021, turned

to a deficit as a result of foreign debt repayments and reversal of the accommodative monetary policy stance.

The domestic foreign exchange (FX) market liquidity was severely affected due to slow recovery of tourism

and earnings from subdued remittances, slow conversion of export proceeds, increased import expenditure,

and sovereign rating downgrades. Investor preference towards short term Treasury bills was experienced at

the primary auctions of the government securities market during the latter part of 2021, and the secondary

market yield curve shifted upward during the second half of 2021 with the removal of the maximum yield

rate and the reversal of the accommodative monetary policy stance. With the shift of domestic investor

preference to the equity market in a low interest rate environment, the Colombo Stock Exchange reported an

exponential growth during 2021. Meanwhile, the country’s systemically important payment and settlement

system was operated smoothly by the Central Bank, with a high degree of resilience through close regulation

and monitoring. Further, the Central Bank continued to introduce law reforms to major legislation with the

view of providing a stronger legal foundation for the

regulatory and supervisory framework. The Central

Bank concluded the second round of discussions

pertaining to a new Banking Act in 2021 and

prepared amendments to the Finance Business

Act No. 42 of 2011 to enhance regulatory and

supervisory powers of the Central Bank.

8.2 Performance of the Banking Sector

The banking sector expanded at a moderate

pace during 2021 compared to the last year

and remained resilient with adequate capital

and liquidity buffers, amidst strong challenges

stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and

related macroeconomic issues. Despite the

continuation of debt moratoria for certain sectors

and gradual lapses of the concessions introduced

by the Central Bank, the banking sector was able

to meet the minimum prudential requirements in

terms of capital and liquidity.

The banking sector continued to dominate

the financial sector accounting for 63.3

per cent of total assets as at end 2021. Despite

the challenging economic environment driven

by the ongoing pandemic and macroeconomy

related concerns, the banking sector maintained

reasonable credit growth during 2021. Deposits

remained the dominant source of funding, while a

notable incline in rupee borrowings was observed

during 2021. However, sourcing foreign borrowings

from external sources was affected by sovereign

rating downgrades. During 2021, the banking sector

profitability improved considerably compared to

the previous year due to notable increases in net

interest income and non-interest income.

Business Expansion: By end 2021, the

banking sector comprised 30 banks, i.e., 24

Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs), including

11 branches of foreign banks, and 6 Licensed

Specialised Banks (LSBs). The banking sector

continued with its intermediation role and expanded

the banking network to facilitate financial inclusion.

In 2021, with the restrictions on physically accessing

banks due to the pandemic, most banks introduced

technology based online products/services to

customers to facilitate their banking needs.

Assets: The banking sector asset base

increased by Rs. 2.3 trillion during the year

and surpassed Rs. 16.9 trillion by end 2021,

recording a year-on-year growth of 15.4

per cent compared to 17.1 per cent growth

reported as at end 2020. Such asset growth

was mainly driven by loans and advances and

investments. The growth in loans and advances

increased from 11.9 per cent in 2020 to 15.3

per cent in 2021. Approximately, 92.2 per cent

of the increase in the loan portfolio during 2021

was attributed to the increase in rupee loans. The

increase in credit was diversified across the major

sectors of the economy. In terms of products,

overdrafts (40.7 per cent), pawning advances (21.5

per cent) and credit cards (12.6 per cent) reported

high growth during 2021. Meanwhile, the year-on-

year growth in investments decelerated from 40

per cent as at end 2020 to 16.4 per cent as at end

2021. The Held to Maturity (HTM) portfolio grew

by 24.8 per cent during 2021 due to increased

investments in Treasury bonds by Rs. 903.7

billion and decreased investments in Treasury bills

and Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) by

Rs. 99.8 billion and Rs. 55 billion, respectively. The

trading portfolio contracted by 21.2 per cent, with

declines in investments in Treasury bills, Treasury

bonds and SLDBs by Rs. 50 billion, Rs. 47.6 billion

and Rs. 63.8 billion, respectively, in nominal terms.

Liabilities: Deposits continued to be

the main source of funding followed by

borrowings. Term deposits accounted for 42.7

per cent of the increase in deposits during 2021

despite a decrease in its share in total deposits

from 63 per cent as at end 2020 to 60.6 per cent

as at end 2021. Meanwhile, savings and current

deposits accounted for 29.5 per cent and 7

per cent, respectively, of total deposits as at

end 2021. Accordingly, the Current and Savings

Account (CASA) ratio increased from 34.5 per cent

in 2020 to 36.6 per cent in 2021. Given the reduced

rate of growth in total deposits during 2021, banks

were compelled to increase their borrowings. Total

borrowings of the banking sector increased by

Rs. 489 billion (28.9 per cent) in 2021 compared

to the increase of Rs. 12.8 billion (0.8 per cent)

in 2020. This increase was mainly attributed to

rupee borrowings which reported a growth of 86.6

per cent (Rs. 688 billion), while foreign currency

borrowings decreased by 27.6 per cent (USD 1.3

billion) during 2021 reflecting the negative impact

of the sovereign rating downgrades.

Off-balance sheet exposures: Due to the

challenging business environment, off-balance

sheet exposures reported a negative growth of

3.2 per cent (decrease of Rs. 160.6 billion) during

2021 compared to a growth of 16.1 per cent

(Rs. 675.2 billion) recorded during 2020.

Significant decreases were observed in FX

exposures (Rs. 410.9 billion) and undrawn credit

lines (Rs. 81.5 billion), while guarantees & bonds

(Rs. 139 billion) and trade related exposures

(documentary credit (Rs. 138.9 billion) and

acceptances (Rs. 92 billion) reported increases

during 2021.

Risks in the Banking Sector

Credit Risk

As the pandemic continued during 2021 in

different scales, several extensions until 2022

were granted for the debt moratoria offered for

pandemic affected individuals and businesses

in certain sectors. Classification of loans and

advances to non-performing categories was frozen

during the period under moratoria, and normal

classification rules will be applied upon cessation of

the moratoria. However, banks have commenced

identifying risk elevated sectors due to COVID-19

for estimating expected credit losses. Despite the

freezing of classification of credit facilities under

moratoria, Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) increased

by Rs. 20.1 billion during 2021 compared to an

increase of Rs. 66.4 billion during 2020. However,

due to the comparatively higher increase in loans

and advances during 2021, the gross NPL ratio

decreased from 4.9 per cent as at end 2020 to 4.5

per cent by end 2021. With the downward migration

of NPLs to categories requiring higher provisions,

the net NPL ratio also reduced during 2021. The

total loan loss provisions increased by Rs. 80.2

billion, of which specific provisions accounted for

84.7 per cent. Despite the increase in NPLs, the

higher increase in provisions resulted in increases

in specific and total provision coverage ratios to 64

per cent and 75.8 per cent, respectively, in 2021.

As a result, the credit risk is at a manageable level

as the banking sector operated with sufficient

provisions and capital buffers to absorb the adverse

impact arising from credit shocks.

Out of the total loan portfolio, 63.8 per cent

of loans were mainly concentrated in 5 sectors

comprising of consumption, construction

& infrastructure, trade, manufacturing, and

agriculture. Manufacturing, wholesale & retail

trade, agriculture, construction, forestry & fishing,

and tourism sectors reported NPL ratios higher

than the total banking sector average of 4.5

per cent as at end 2021.

In addition, according to the Sri Lanka

Financial Reporting Standards 9 (SLFRS 9)

after the implementation of the expected loss

model, the ratio of stage 3 loans to total loans

in the banking sector indicated 7.64 per cent

and the ratio of stage 3 loans (net of stage

3 impairment) to total loans (net of stage 3

impairment) indicated 4.26 per cent as at end

2021.

Market Risk

Interest Rate: The interest rate sensitivity

ratio (interest bearing assets as a share of

interest-bearing liabilities with maturities of

less than 12 months) increased to 79.6 per cent

as at end 2021 from 74.9 per cent as at end

2020, indicating a reduction in the exposure to

interest rate risk by end 2021 compared to end

2020. Capital gains on Treasury bonds during 2021

stood at Rs. 4.1 billion and was lower than Rs. 12.2

billion recorded during 2020. This was mainly due

to the low interest rates that prevailed in 2020 that

led to higher gains while the upward adjustment of

interest rates was observed during the latter half

of 2021 with the tightening of the monetary policy.

Equity Prices: The equity risk of the

banking sector was minimal throughout 2021.

The exposure of banks’ trading portfolio to the

equity market was Rs. 12.5 billion, which was only

0.1 per cent and 2.1 per cent of the total assets

and investments held for trading, respectively, as

at end 2021.

Exchange Rates: The net foreign currency

exposure of the banking sector increased to

a long position of US dollars 133.2 million as

at end 2021 compared to a short position of

US dollars 30 million as at end 2020, with a

higher decrease in foreign currency liabilities

percentage of banks’ on-balance sheet foreign

currency assets stood at 1.3 per cent as at end

2021, increasing from 0.3 per cent at end 2020.

During 2021, on-balance sheet foreign currency

assets increased mainly due to the increase in

loans, placements with banks and investments,

and the increase was lower than the decrease in

off-balance sheet assets resulting from decreases

in forward purchases and other derivative

products. Meanwhile the increase in on-balance

sheet foreign currency liabilities was attributed

to the increase in customer deposits and the

decrease in off-balance sheet liabilities was

mainly from forward sales. The banking sector

reported a net foreign currency revaluation gain of

Rs. 28.7 billion during 2021 compared to Rs. 16.5

billion during 2020.

Liquidity Risk: On an overall basis, the

banking sector was in compliance with the

minimum Statutory Liquid Assets Ratio

(SLAR) of 20 per cent. The Domestic Banking

Units (DBUs) of LCBs and LSBs are required to

maintain a minimum SLAR of 20 per cent. SLAR of

DBUs declined from 37.8 per cent as at end 2020

to 33.8 per cent as at end 2021, while the SLAR of

Off-shore Banking Units (OBUs) decreased

from 43.2 per cent to 34 per cent during the

corresponding period. Despite the higher increase

in credit during 2021, the credit to deposits and

borrowings ratio decreased marginally while the

liquid assets to total assets and liquid assets to

deposits ratios decreased.

The rupee and all currency Liquidity

Coverage Ratios (LCRs), which is the stock

of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets

that can be converted easily and immediately

into cash in the secondary market to meet

liquidity needs for a period of 30 days under

a liquidity stress scenario of the banking

industry stood at 217.8 per cent and 171.8

per cent, respectively, by end 2021, well above

the regulatory minimum of 100 per cent. In

addition, the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR),

i.e., the amount of available stable funding relative

to the amount of required stable funding, stood

at 135.1 per cent by end 2021, well above the

regulatory requirement of 100 per cent. Total liquid

assets amounted to Rs. 5 trillion as at end 2021,

of which investments in government securities

represented 75.2 per cent. The cumulative maturity

gap as a percentage of cumulative liabilities of

the banking sector for maturity buckets less than

30 days and beyond 12 months widened as at

end 2021 compared to end 2020, indicating better

management of assets and liabilities in the short

term, considering the declining trend in interest

rates where more liabilities get repriced at lower

banks being able to meet the minimum liquidity

requirements, excessive widening of the maturity

gap may lead to an increase in liquidity risk.

Performance of the Banking Sector

Profitability: Interest income of the banking

sector increased by 3.2 per cent compared

to a decrease of interest expenses by 11.5

per cent during 2021, resulting in an increase

in net interest income by 28.5 per cent. As a

result, the net interest margin increased from 3.1

per cent as at end 2020 to 3.4 per cent as at end

2021. Net interest income increased by Rs. 121.8

billion during 2021 compared to the previous

year, while non-interest income increased by

Rs. 24.6 billion, mainly due to higher foreign

currency revaluation gains during 2021. Non-

interest expenses increased by Rs. 47.4 billion,

largely due to the increase in staff cost by Rs. 20.5

billion, while loan loss provisions increased by

Rs. 7.7 billion during 2021 compared to 2020. As

a result, profit before corporate tax was Rs. 258.7

billion in 2021 as per the regulatory reporting, which

was Rs. 69 billion more than the previous year.

Profit after tax of the banking industry was

Rs. 198.4 billion by end 2021 which recorded

an increase of 46 per cent compared to the

previous year. The increase in profits was

reflected in Return on Assets (ROA) – before

tax, which improved from 1.4 per cent as at end

2020 to 1.6 per cent as at end 2021, while Return

on Equity (ROE) – after tax improved from 11.4

per cent in 2020 to 14.5 per cent in 2021. Further,

through retention of profits (Rs. 70 billion) and

issuance of new shares (Rs. 16.8 billion) during

2021. The regulatory capital of the banking sector

reported a growth of 4.3 per cent during the year,

of which Tier 1 capital contributed to 75.7 per cent

of the increase.

Supervisory and Regulatory Developments during 2021

During 2021, the Central Bank continued

to introduce prudential policy measures and

regulations to strengthen the financial and

operational resilience of licensed banks to ensure

the safety and soundness of the banking sector.

In the meantime, the Central Bank cautiously

relaxed some of the regulations to facilitate the

banking sector to adjust to the new normal and

to continue providing concessions to economic

sectors affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.

The Central Bank introduced a priority sector

lending target on credit granted by licensed banks

to individuals and businesses in the Micro, Small

and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector, with a

view to promoting economic sectors with high

growth potential in terms of domestic economic

growth and exports earnings leading to a broad

based revival of the economy. Accordingly,

licensed banks were required to increase their

credit to individuals and businesses in the MSME

sector by not less than 20 per cent per annum on

year-on-year basis, over the outstanding stock

of lending to MSMEs at the end of the previous

year. Further, licensed banks were also required

to suspend recovery actions against paddy millers

in the Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) sector

for a period of six months, starting from 1 January

2021, considering the Government’s initiatives

to support SME paddy millers affected by the

COVID-19 pandemic, for the upcoming harvesting

season.

the efficiency ratio improved from 51.8 per cent in

2020 to 48.1 per cent in 2021 as a result of the

decrease in operating costs.

Capital: The banking sector was in

compliance with the capital requirements

during 2021. None of the banks drew down the

capital conservation buffer during the period

concerned.

Considering the challenges in raising fresh

capital, the deadline to meet the enhanced

minimum capital requirement for banks was

extended till December 2022. Banks were

encouraged to raise high quality capital after

recognising the first day impact from implementation

of SLFRS 9. As a result, banks raised Tier I capital

The Central Bank continued its efforts to

support businesses and individuals affected

by the COVID-19 pandemic, while ensuring the

safety and soundness of the financial system,

despite the impact of the prolonged debt

moratoria. Policy measures adopted include

providing concessions for lease facilities obtained

by the affected businesses and individuals

engaged in passenger transportation services for

six months commencing from April 2021, extending

the debt moratoria granted to COVID-19 affected

businesses and individuals in the tourism sector for

another six months commencing from April 2021,

and extending the relief measures and concessions

provided to businesses and individuals who were

adversely affected by the third wave of COVID-19

outbreak. These concessions were subsequently

extended in September 2021 until end 2021, and

in the case of the tourism sector, up to end June

2022, considering the subsequent upsurge of

the pandemic. As at end 2021 approximately 6

per cent of the loans of the banking sector were

under moratoria. However, the potential impact of

these loans will be net of the underlying security

values and impairment already made on these

loans.

As an alternative to moratoria, banks were

requested to consider providing the borrowers

with an option to restructure their existing

facilities over a longer tenure at the prevailing

low interest rates in the market, considering the

future cash flows and subject to the submission

of a viable revival plan. Further, the suspension

of all types of recovery actions such as ‘parate’

execution and forced repossession of leased

assets against affected borrowers was extended

until end March 2022 and until end June 2022 for

the tourism industry.

The restrictions imposed on discretionary

payments of licensed banks were temporarily

relaxed in January 2021 and reimposed in July

2021. Accordingly, licensed banks were permitted

to pay cash dividends and repatriate profits only

after the completion of the audit of the financial

statements for the year 2020, while refraining

from engaging in share buy-backs and increasing

non-essential expenditure and exercising extreme

due diligence and prudence when incurring

capital expenditure until end June 2021. The

restrictions were reviewed and reimposed in July

2021, in light of the possible adverse impact on

liquidity and other key performance indicators of

licensed banks due to the subsequent upsurge of

the COVID-19 pandemic.

During 2021, the Central Bank continued to

take proactive regulatory measures to curtail the

possible/potential outflow of foreign exchange

from licensed banks to avoid excess volatility

in the foreign exchange market, to ease the

pressure on the exchange rate, and minimise

the impact on banks’ risk management. These

measures included temporary restrictions on

entering forward contracts of foreign exchange

by licensed banks, margin requirements against

imports and the temporary suspension of the

purchase of Sri Lanka International Sovereign

Bonds (ISBs) by LCBs and National Savings

Bank (NSB). Further, the Central Bank introduced

amendments to the Banking Act Directions on

foreign currency borrowings by licensed banks

to stimulate capital formation in the real economy

and to support the foreign currency needs of the

country.

The credit risk management and governance

framework in relation to financial instruments

of licensed banks were strengthened and

aligned with the classification, recognition

and measurement criteria for credit facilities

and other financial assets under the Sri Lanka

Accounting Standard ‘SLFRS 9: Financial

Instruments’ to establish consistent and prudent

practices in the banking industry. It is expected

that the implementation of these new Directions

will facilitate a more accurate assessment of the

current as well as potential future risks of credit

facilities and other financial assets of licensed

banks.

Improving the operational resilience of the

licensed banks was one of the key focus areas

of the Central Bank during 2021. Accordingly,

in June 2021, licensed banks were informed

to maintain recovery plans to deal with shocks

to capital, liquidity and all other aspects that

may arise from institution-specific stresses,

market-wide stresses, or a combination of both.

A regulatory framework for technology risk

management and resilience of licensed banks

was introduced to prompt banks to upgrade

and strengthen their information systems and

technology platforms in line with international

standards and best practices. This framework sets

minimum regulatory requirements on technology

risk management and resilience for licensed banks

in general as well as based on the sensitivity of

data, the criticality of information systems, and

the type of information system infrastructure used.

These requirements are also aimed at improving

the governance framework for technology risk

management.

Maximum interest rates on foreign currency

deposits of LCBs and NSB were imposed

considering the prevailing interest rates of foreign

currency denominated deposits, and maximum

interest rates on mortgage-backed housing loans

were also imposed considering the current and

expected macroeconomic developments.

Several other policy measures were

also introduced in 2021 as per regulatory

requirements. These include amending capital

requirements under Basel III for licensed banks on

the risk weights applicable for foreign claims on the

central Government, determination of Thai Baht

as a designated foreign currency, recognition of

Lanka Rating Agency Ltd. as an acceptable credit

rating agency, provision of banking services during

the lockdown periods, and introduction of a new

structure for the annual license fee of licensed banks

for the year 2022. The list of all policy changes and

measures introduced during 2021 is available in the

Major Economic Policy Measures 2021 section of

this report.

The Central Bank upgraded its Statutory

Examinations of banks to a more robust risk based

examination mechanism and a comprehensive

supervisory guidance framework based on the

internal rating model named Bank Sustainability

Rating Indicator (BSRI). Accordingly, internal ratings

were assigned to all 30 licensed banks and statutory

examinations of all banks were conducted in line with

the BSRI framework and BSRI is being improved to

facilitate risk based supervision. Ways and means

to improve internal ratings assigned to banks will

be focused during future statutory examinations

by allocating more resources to examine high risk

areas and weak/inefficient operations of banks.

Further, Consolidated Risk Based Supervision of

selected banking groups was conducted, extending

the scope of statutory examinations of the Central

Bank to the risks stemming from group entities.

The biggest economic challenge faced by humankind in the past century

COVID-19 is arguably the biggest health and economic challenge faced by humankind in this century. In 2020, over 90 per cent of the countries worldwide recorded contractions in their economic activities. The interconnectedness and interdependence of the global economy made the impact of the pandemic unprecedented, surpassing the effects of the two world wars, the great depression, and the global financial crisis (The World Bank, 2022).

How did Central banks react to COVID-19?

Central banks and monetary authorities worldwide introduced both conventional and unconventional policy responses to address the multifaceted challenges of the pandemic. These measures include monetary policy relaxations, asset repurchasing/quantitative easing programmes, and regulatory forbearances, as well as government-led fiscal measures such as tax reductions/deferments, direct cash payments, insolvency support and payment freezes/moratoria (International Monetary Fund, 2022).

In the wake of the pandemic, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) also introduced a series of extraordinary policy measures to provide liquidity to the economy and regulatory forbearances to provide operational flexibility to licensed banks and non-banking financial institutions (NBFIs), (hereinafter referred to as financial institutions, FIs) to assist their customers.

Accordingly, CBSL requested FIs to provide a six-month moratorium on capital and interest payments on loans obtained by borrowers affected by the pandemic and to waive off any accrued and unpaid penal interest charged on such loans. Considering the subsequent waves of the pandemic, this was extended for more than 18 months for customers who were severely affected.

Additionally, CBSL also introduced a Rs. 50 billion refinancing and credit guarantee scheme to provide low-cost funding for Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) customers, reduced interest rates on targeted lending products, provided liquidity facility to the construction sector and other government suppliers, suspended recovery actions against non-performing loans, and reduced fees and charges on several banking services to provide relief to retail customers.

New Challenges and Opportunities created by the Pandemic

COVID-19 affected businesses disproportionately. Some businesses and economic sectors came to a complete standstill while some found new opportunities and avenues to grow their businesses amidst the pandemic.

BOX 9COVID-19 Concessions and Moratoria: Challenges and Way Forward

As the pandemic unfolds, many businesses worldwide adopted remote working and flexible working arrangements, which have now become a norm due to its’ versatility and cost savings. Similarly, many businesses have already replaced expensive business travels and meetings with online conferences and virtual meetings. These shifts in preferences have forced businesses to rewire their infrastructure to be predominantly hybrid (Sadun, Simcoe, & Conti, 2021; Nugent, 2021). Further, the increased consumer preferences towards digital services and online shopping have pushed many businesses in the service sector such as supermarkets, retail, fashion, and entertainment to bring their businesses mobile-first. This phenomenon was also apparent in the local context such as increasing demand for online retail shopping, video consultations for doctors, online learning and tuition service providers and reduced demand for cinemas, large wedding receptions, concerts, exhibitions, and events. While these changes affected some businesses and their value chains adversely, many firms have embraced the change to spur innovation turning the changes into opportunities.

Similarly, FIs as well as the financial sector witnessed their fair share of pains and gains during the pandemic. Liquidity and credit risks were the most significant challenges faced by FIs worldwide during the pandemic. Closure of businesses, loss of jobs and income due to the pandemic and induced economic disruptions made it increasingly difficult for borrowers to honour their debt repayment obligations. Even for those who were repaying promptly, the probability of default in the future increased significantly, due to the increasing uncertainty in the global economy. This significantly impacted the asset quality of FIs. Liquidity positions of FIs also tightened as borrowers delayed their repayments and depositors withdrew their monies more often. This impaired FIs' ability to lend, curtailing credit flows to revive economic activities.

Raising new funds and rolling over the existing funding lines was another challenge faced by FIs as lenders, depositors, and investors of FIs were reluctant to commit more funds due to the increased uncertainty. This increased the cost of funding and refinancing risk of FIs.

The pandemic also increased other risks such as operational risk, health & safety risk, and business continuity risk. The increased reliance on digital delivery channels elevated the cybersecurity risk and technology risk, compelling FIs to commit more resources to mitigate these emerging risks and threats. Ultimately, the foregoing translated into increased strategic risk. FIs were required to reassess their risks, rearrange their priorities, and refocus their business directions as strategies planned before the pandemic became no

longer valid in the “new normal”.

However, certain business segments such as online banking, cashless payments and digital wallets witnessed exponential growth during the pandemic. FIs benefited from the reduced interest rates generally observed globally and in the local context, and from the exchange rate movements, due to mark-to-market gains on foreign currency assets. CBSL monitored these developments and introduced timely regulatory measures, where necessary, to prudently manage the increased risks in the financial sector.

Balancing Basics: Concessions and Stability

CBSL, as the apex financial authority in the country, took timely measures to provide concessions and revive the affected economic sectors while avoiding excessive risk buildup which can impact the core objectives of CBSL: to maintain economic and price stability and the financial system stability.

CBSL introduced the debt moratorium as a short-term remedy for borrowers who faced cashflow difficulties amidst the pandemic and to prevent loans of such borrowers from getting into non-performing category and its ensuing consequences. However, as the tenure of the moratoria and the value of loans grew bigger, FIs had to find alternative funding to pay their depositors and to meet other operating costs during the moratorium period. Considering the above, CBSL permitted FIs to charge a nominal interest on the moratoria, sufficient to cover the costs of funds. Subsequently, CBSL initiated preparatory works to introduce a mechanism to provide a least-cost solution to both borrowers and FIs, having considered the difficulties faced by borrowers due to charging additional interest.

Despite sparking much debate among the public, this additional interest allowed FIs to permit their borrowers to defer loan repayments for more than 18 months, without creating undue stress on depositors’ funds and maintaining the stability of the individual FIs and the financial system.

Unwinding Moratoria: The Importance of Timing

As economic activities are returning to normalcy and countries opening their borders for trade, Central banks worldwide gradually phased out the extraordinary policy measures placed in response to COVID-19. However, experts warn that a premature upliftment of support measures that maintained liquidity and solvency of the economy may cause widespread credit constraints, debt foreclosures, insolvencies, and increased unemployment. This can be detrimental to post-pandemic economic revival and the self-reinforcing nature of these effects can have both short and long term consequences due to the feedback effect (Financial Stability Board, 2021).

On the other hand, maintaining support measures for

too long can result in increased indebtedness, excessive risk-taking by firms and households, increased credit risk and creating moral hazard. The cost of running concessions for too long can be prohibitively expensive for countries with tight fiscal positions. Further, it can also slow down the necessary economic adjustments such as culling weak and unviable business/business models to reallocate economic resources to more efficient sectors, and technological transformation (Financial Stability Board, 2021).

What’s beyond moratoria?

Unwinding moratoria and other relief measures can be challenging for both borrowers and FIs. As discussed above, the pandemic made permanent changes in several industries making some business models no longer profitable as they used to be (Jacobides & Reeves, 2020).

From a business continuity point of view, the pandemic was an acid test for firms that lack capital, contingency planning and agile decision making. For some firms, the main factor that kept such businesses afloat during the pandemic was the concessionary measures. Therefore, any efforts to revive businesses by FIs should focus on firms that are financially viable but suffering from liquidity and solvency problems caused directly by the pandemic. Also, such interventions should be transparent and should not distort the market competition (OECD, 2021).

Considering the above, CBSL issued guidelines to licensed banks to establish post-pandemic economic revival units in licensed banks to revive viable businesses. Accordingly, licensed banks will formulate revival plans and identify under-performing and non-performing borrowers with viable businesses who require rehabilitation assistance, including those who require liquidity support to unwind moratoria.

A mix of financial and non-financial assistance will be available to such borrowers to restructure/reschedule their existing credit facilities and will also grant additional credit facilities and/or any other appropriate support measures on a need basis to revive their businesses.

However, these will not be available to borrowers that have been identified as willful defaulters, defaulters who have diverted the borrowed funds for other purposes and those with unviable businesses or business projects and those who have defaulted due to mismanagement and/or fraud in their businesses.

The Way Forward: A Sustainable, Inclusive Economic Recovery

The end goal of all the above interventions is to minimise disruptions to the economy and restore normalcy in the livelihood of the people. In this regard, all stakeholders of the economy should collectively reflect on the lessons learnt from the pandemic and make conscious efforts to secure a sustainable and inclusive post-pandemic economic recovery.

Going forward, both FIs and firms should rethink their business models, explore new business opportunities created by the pandemic and redesign their processes and procedures to improve efficiency and competitiveness. Investing in technology and upgrading IT infrastructure while prudently managing increased risks will be another priority going forward. In doing so, they may also have to be mindful of their debt levels and seek to consolidate, restructure, or reschedule their debt to match their new cashflows and repayment capacities or find alternative avenues for low-cost funding or internal capital formation to maintain solvency and support such growth.

In this regard CBSL has initiated several policy measures to promote internal capital formation, recovery planning, technology risk management, provide long-term low-cost funding and orderly disposal of non-performing assets of FIs.

Business Expansion

Outreach: By end 2021, the sector comprised

39 LFCs1 and 3 SLCs. There were 1,707 branches

and 309 other outlets, of which 1,359 branches and

outlets (67.4 per cent) were located outside the

Western Province.

Assets: The asset base of the sector

increased by 6.1 per cent (by Rs. 86 billion) to

Rs. 1,487.7 billion in 2021, compared to the 2.2

per cent contraction observed in 2020. The sector

expansion was mainly driven by the growth in the

loans and advances portfolio. Loans and advances

accounted for 76.8 per cent of the total assets of

the sector. The loans and advances portfolio of the

sector was highly concentrated on finance leases

which accounted for 48.3 per cent of total loans and

advances as at end 2021. The growth of the leasing

portfolio declined mainly due to the restrictions

imposed by the Government on the importation of

motor vehicles as a measure to restrict FX outflows.

However, the loans and advances portfolio of the

sector recorded a growth during the year due to

the increase in other secured loans and advances

and pawing advances. Accordingly, the loans and

advances provided by the LFCs and SLCs sector

increased by 9.9 per cent (Rs. 102.7 billion) to

Rs. 1,142.5 billion in 2021 compared to the

contraction of 5.7 per cent in 2020.

The investment portfolio of the LFCs and

SLCs sector comprises investments in equities,

corporate debt instruments, government

securities and investment properties. The

investment portfolio recorded only a marginal growth

of 5.4 per cent reaching Rs. 167.4 billion in 2021

compared to the significant growth of 20.2 per cent

in 2020, mainly due to the increased investments

in government securities maturing in less than 12

months. Other assets that mainly include cash and

cash balances with banks and financial institutions

declined by 12.4 per cent in 2021.

Liabilities: Customer deposits continued to

dominate the liabilities of the LFCs and SLCs

sector accounting for a share of 52.7 per cent.

The deposits increased by 4.6 per cent (Rs. 34.7

billion) to Rs. 783.3 billion, while borrowings declined

by 0.6 per cent (Rs. 2.1 billion) to Rs. 325.9 billion

during the year.

Profitability: The net interest income of the

sector significantly increased by 18.2 per cent

(Rs. 20.2 billion) in 2021 reaching Rs. 131.4

billion. This was due to the significant decline

in interest expenses by 27.1 per cent (Rs. 31.8

billion) despite the decline in interest income by 5

per cent (Rs. 11.5 billion). The net interest margin

of the sector (net interest income as a percentage

of average assets) increased to 8.6 per cent in

2021 from the 7.3 per cent in 2020, due to a greater

increase in the net interest income compared to the

marginal increase in (gross) average assets.

The non-interest income increased by 54.5

per cent (Rs. 17.5 billion) and non-interest

expenses increased by 11.1 per cent

(Rs. 8.7 billion) during 2021 which significantly

contributed to the profitability of the sector.

Non-interest expenses increased mainly due

to the increases in salaries, wages, and other

benefits to the staff (Rs. 4.7 billion), administrative

expenses (Rs. 2.8 billion), and other expenses

(Rs. 3 billion). The loan loss provisions made

against NPLs declined by Rs. 27.1 billion, largely

due to increased collection during the period. The

sector’s profit after tax significantly grew by 307.1

per cent from Rs. 13.7 billion in 2020 to Rs. 55.6

billion in 2021, mainly due to the substantial increase

in non-interest income by Rs. 17.5 billion including

gains from trading or investment securities by

Rs. 1.2 billion, service charges by Rs. 1.8 billion and

default charges by Rs. 6.8 billion. The increase in

profitability was reflected in the sharp increase in the

Return on Equity (ROE) to 20.2 per cent and Return

on Assets (ROA) before tax to 5.4 per cent in 2021,

relative to 6.1 per cent and 1.7 per cent recorded

respectively, in 2020. High ROA and ROE figures

would be beneficial for the sector’s capital generation

enabling the attraction of new investors to the

sector. The cost to income ratio also improved to 69

per cent in 2021, from 89.7 per cent in 2020, largely

due to the reduction in total expenses and increased

income during the period, while the efficiency ratio

improved to 51.3 per cent during 2021.

Capital: The sector continued to remain

resilient with capital maintained above the

minimum regulatory requirement during the

year. The capital base improved to Rs. 251.6 billion

by end 2021 compared to Rs. 218.9 billion recorded

by end 2020, with the infusion of new capital by

several LFCs to meet regulatory requirements of

Rs. 2 billion by 01 January 2021 and Rs. 2.5 billion

by 01 January 2022. The sector’s core capital and

total capital ratios increased to 15.5 per cent and 17

per cent, respectively, by end 2021 from the reported

levels of 14.5 per cent and 15.7 per cent at end 2020.

In 2021, the Masterplan was introduced to

build a strong and stable 25 Non-Bank Financial

Institutions complying with prudential

requirements with diversified business models.

6 preliminary approvals have already been

granted to 12 LFCs/SLCs for acquisitions and

amalgamations under the Masterplan. In addition

to the introduction of the Masterplan, several

regulatory actions were also initiated by the Central

Bank with a view to avoiding further deterioration

of the financial positions, maintaining the stability

of such institutions, and safeguarding the interests

of depositors.

Risks in the LFCs and SLCs Sector

Credit Risk: Total gross NPLs reduced by 13.9

per cent (Rs. 22. billion) by end December 2021

on a year-on-year basis, compared to an increase

of 26.2 per cent (Rs. 33.4 billion) recorded at end

December 2020. Although the gross NPL ratio

declined to 11 per cent by end 2021 from 13.9

per cent reported as at end 2020, still the NPL

ratio of the sector remains high. The net NPL ratio

reduced to 2.7 per cent by end 2021 from 4.2 per

cent reported by end 2020, due to higher provision

coverage for NPLs. The provision coverage ratio

increased to 66.8 per cent in December 2021,

compared to 58.9 per cent reported in December

2020. Though the underlying credit risk of the

sector still remains manageable, the impact of

the freezing of classification of loans under the

moratoria needs to be factored in when assessing

the credit risk of the sector. Similarly, following

the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increasing

trend in pawning advances and gold loans in 2021

(by Rs. 58 billion). Hence, any potential price

drop in the gold market would adversely affect the

performance of the sector and its NPLs.

Market Risk: The sector continued to

experience a low market risk which comprises

interest rate risk and equity risk.

Interest Rate Risk: With the recent persistent

upward revisions of Treasury bill interest rates,

reference rates for deposits were revised upward

from 01 November 2021. Accordingly, interest rate

risk may increase due the negative mismatch in

the maturity profile of the interest-bearing assets

and liabilities.

Equity Risk: Equity risk of the sector remained

low during the period under review as the exposure

to equity market in the form of investments in listed

shares declined to 0.8 per cent in 2021 from 1

per cent of total assets in 2020.

Liquidity Risk: The sector maintained liquidity

well above the minimum required level during 2021.

The overall regulatory liquid assets available in

the sector was Rs. 155.9 billion by end December

2021, against the stipulated minimum requirement

of Rs. 89.9 billion. However, the liquidity surplus

by end 2021 declined by 25.9 per cent (Rs. 23

billion) compared to the liquidity surplus of Rs. 89

billion recorded in December 2020, mainly due to

the increase in minimum liquidity requirements

consequent to the discontinuation of regulatory

relaxations imposed on liquid asset requirements in

response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The liquidity

ratio (liquid assets against deposits and borrowing)

increased to 14.1 per cent by end December 2021,

compared to 13 per cent recorded by end 2020.

Primary Dealer Companies in Government Securities

As at end 2021, there were 6 LCBs and 7

Primary Dealer Companies (PDCs) appointed

as Primary Dealers (PDs) in the government

securities market. Pan Asia Banking Corporation

PLC (PABC) and Perpetual Treasuries Limited

(PTL) were suspended from carrying on business

and activities of a PD on 15 August 2017 and 06

July 2017, respectively. The participation in primary

auctions was prohibited for Entrust Securities PLC

(ESP) w.e.f. 24 July 2017. Accordingly, only 5

LCBs and 5 PDCs were active in the government

securities market as PDs as at end of 2021.

Assets and Liabilities: Total assets of PDCs

decreased by 9.8 per cent to Rs. 78.7 billion in

2021. The total investment portfolio of government

securities, consisting of trading, available for sale

and HTM portfolios amounted to Rs. 70.5 billion as

at end 2021, which recorded a decline of 12 per cent

during the year. The trading portfolio decreased to

Rs. 54.9 billion by end 2021 from Rs. 62.6 billion

recorded as at end 2020, while the HTM portfolio

declined to Rs. 12 billion as at end 2021 from

Rs. 14.7 billion as at end 2020. The available for

sale portfolio increased to Rs. 3.6 billion by end of

2021 compared to Rs. 2.8 billion as at end 2020.

Profitability: PDCs reported a loss after

tax of Rs. 0.4 billion during 2021 compared to

the profit after tax of Rs. 4.9 billion reported

during 2020, indicating a significant decline in

profitability consequent to the increase in yield

rates. The significant drop in capital gains along

with the considerable increase in mark-to-market

losses recorded by PDCs in 2021 compared to

2020, largely contributed to the after-tax loss

reported in 2021. Furthermore, ROA and ROE

of PDCs contracted to negative 0.7 per cent and

negative 3.2 per cent, respectively, by end of 2021

from 7.6 per cent and 30.5 per cent, respectively,

as recorded in 2020.

Capital: Equity of PDCs contracted by 6.7

per cent mainly due to losses incurred during

the year. The Risk Weighted Capital Adequacy

Ratio (RWCAR) of the PDCs was well above the

minimum required amount of 10 per cent and

increased to 42.8 per cent as at end 2021 from 27

per cent reported as at end 2020.

Risks in the PDCs Sector

Market Risk: The proportion of the trading

portfolio in the total investment portfolio of PDCs

decreased marginally and was recorded at 77.9

per cent as at end 2021 compared to 78.2 per cent

as at end 2020, reflecting a marginal decrease in

the relative market risk exposure of the industry.

Liquidity Risk: The overall liquidity risk

exposure of PDCs increased due to the increase

in overnight negative mismatch in the maturity

profile of assets and liabilities of PDCs by

end 2021. The overnight negative mismatch

increased to Rs. 20.3 billion as at end 2021 from

Rs. 13 billion (79.5 per cent) as at end 2020.

This is an increase in overnight liabilities by 82.8

per cent as at end 2021. In view of holding a large

volume of government securities, which is free

of credit risk, by PDCs and the ability to use such

government securities as collateral for obtaining

funds to bridge any unforeseen liquidity gaps, the

liquidity risk profile of PDCs remained low throughout

the year except ESP which was facing liquidity

issues. Most of the PDCs had standby contingency

funding arrangements to bridge any liquidity gaps.

Market Conduct

Primary Market Activities: The participation

in primary auctions in respect of Treasury bills

and Treasury bonds by PDCs showed a mixed

performance during 2021. Of the total bids accepted

at 52 Treasury bills auctions conducted in 2021, the

effective participation of LCBs appointed as PDCs,

PDCs and Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF)

accounted to 43.1 per cent, 56.3 per cent and 0.6

per cent, respectively. At 22 Treasury bond auctions

conducted during 2021, effective participation

of LCBs appointed as PDCs, PDCs and EPF

accounted to 36 per cent, 27.5 per cent and 36.5

per cent, respectively.

Secondary Market Activities of PDCs:

Secondary market transactions in government

securities (in terms of value) by PDCs decreased

by 33.1 per cent to Rs. 5,068.3 billion in 2021, out

of which repo transactions accounted to 63.5

per cent. During 2021, outright purchases decreased

by 56 per cent and outright sales by PDCs increased

by 11.4 per cent, compared to 2020.

Licensed Microfinance Companies

The Licensed Microfinance Companies (LMFC)

sector consisted of 4 companies and reported a

27.2 per cent growth of its assets base reaching

Rs. 8.4 billion as at end 2021. Microfinance loans

and advances accounted for the largest share of

total assets with 74.6 per cent. Microfinance Loans

and Advances amounted to Rs. 6.3 billion as at end

2021 in comparison to the Rs. 5.3 billion as at end

2020, reporting a growth of 14.8 per cent. NPLs

of LMFCs stood at 16.8 per cent as at end 2021.

The total deposit base of the sector grew by 11

per cent in 2021 from Rs. 488 million in 2020 to

Rs. 544 million in 2021. Despite the increase in

total liabilities of the sector by 29 per cent from

Rs. 4.4 billion in 2020 to Rs. 5.5 billion in 2021, the

debt-to-equity ratio increased to 2.0 per cent by end

2021 with the increase of equity from 1.9 per cent

recorded at end 2020. In order to utilise the available

liquid assets to meet operational costs during the

COVID-19 pandemic, the Monetary Board continued

its decision to withdraw the requirement for LMFCs

to maintain liquid assets as per the Microfinance Act

No. 6 of 2016. The core capital level of the sector

remained at Rs. 2.7 billion and all LMFCs were in

compliance with the minimum prudential regulations

on core capital.

Unit Trusts

The number of Unit Trusts (UTs) remained

unchanged at 75 at end 2021 similar to end 2020,

while the number of UT management companies

decreased to 16 at end 2021, from 18 reported at

end 2020. The UTs funds were mainly dominated

by money market funds and followed by Income

Funds with the representation of 23 per cent and 21

per cent of the UT industry, respectively. In addition,

Gilt Edged Funds, Growth Funds and Balanced

Funds accounted for 15 per cent, 13 per cent and 12

per cent of the UT industry, respectively.

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

of net assets increased to 9.1 per cent at end

2021 compared to 7 per cent at end 2020.

Insurance Sector

By end 2021, there were 27 insurance

companies operating in the country

comprising 13 long term insurance

companies, 12 general insurance companies

and 2 companies involved in both long term

and general insurance business.

The insurance sector reported a modest

growth in its asset base in 2021. The total assets

of the insurance sector grew by 11.4 per cent by

end 2021 on a year-on-year basis and reached

Rs. 879.8 billion. The asset base of the long term

insurance subsector grew by 12.3 per cent to

Rs. 633 billion by end 2021 compared to a growth

of 16.1 per cent recorded at end 2020, whereas

the asset base of the general insurance subsector

increased by 9.2 per cent and reached Rs. 246.8

billion at end 2021. The share of the asset base of

the long term insurance subsector over the total

insurance sector asset base remained high at

71.9 per cent by end 2021 which was a marginal

increase from 71.4 per cent recorded by end 2020.

Corresponding to this increase, the share of general

insurance subsector assets over total assets

declined to 28.1 per cent by end 2021 from 28.6

per cent recorded at end 2020.

Gross written premium of the insurance

sector grew by 12.2 per cent to Rs. 233.8

insurance subsector increased to 7.2 per cent

and 8 per cent, respectively, at end 2021 from 6.3

per cent and 7.6 per cent at end 2020.

Superannuation Funds

The total assets of the superannuation funds

were reported at Rs. 3,876.3 billion by end 2021

contributing to 14.5 per cent of the financial

sector assets. The sector is dominated by the

EPF, which accounts for 81.7 per cent of the total

assets of the superannuation sector. In addition

to the EPF, there are two other publicly managed

funds, namely, the Employees’ Trust Fund (ETF)

and the state sector Public Service Provident Fund

(PSPF).

Employees’ Provident Fund

As per the Employees’ Provident Fund Act

No. 15 of 1958 (EPF Act), the Monetary Board

of the Central Bank is entrusted with the

custodianship of the Employees’ Provident

Fund (EPF/Fund), while the Commissioner

of Labour is entrusted with the general

administration of the Fund. The EPF Department

of the Central Bank facilitates the Monetary Board

to perform its duties and functions as per the

provisions of the EPF Act.

The total value of the Fund increased by

Rs. 341.8 billion to Rs. 3,166.1 billion as at

end 2021 from Rs. 2,824.3 billion reported by

end 2020, recording a 12.1 per cent growth.

This growth was an outcome of a combined effect

of the net contributions of the members (amount

of contributions received less refunds paid) and

the income generated through investments of

the Fund. Total liability to the members stood at

Rs. 3,066.9 billion as at end 2021 recording a 10.8

per cent increase from Rs. 2,767.8 billion as at

end 2020. The total contribution for the year 2021

increased by 9.9 per cent to Rs. 165.7 billion, while

the total amount of refunds to the members and their

legal heirs was Rs. 118.2 billion in 2021, which was

an increase of 7.7 per cent over 2020. Accordingly,

the net contribution to the Fund was Rs. 47.5 billion

compared to Rs. 41.0 billion recorded in the previous

year. The annual profit of the Fund increased by

22.1 per cent to Rs. 299.1 billion in 2021 from

Rs. 244.9 billion recorded in the previous year. This

was mainly due to the increase in the net gain on

financial instruments at fair value through profit or

loss (listed equities) by Rs. 36.8 billion.

The total investment portfolio (book value)

of the Fund grew by 12.2 per cent to Rs. 3,173.3

billion as at end of 2021 from Rs. 2,829.5 billion

as at end of 2020. The investment policy of the

Fund is focused on providing long term positive

real returns to the members, while ensuring the

safety of the Fund and the availability of adequate

level of liquidity to meet refund payments and other

expenses of the Fund. Accordingly, as at end of

2021, the investment portfolio consisted of 93.2

per cent in government securities, 3.8 per cent in

equity, 0.8 per cent in corporate debentures, 1.8

per cent in fixed deposits, and the remaining 0.4

per cent in Reverse Repurchase agreements.

Investment Income: The total investment

income of the Fund was Rs. 342.2 billion in

2021 and recorded an increase of 19.9 per cent

compared to previous year. Interest income

continued to be the major source of income to

the Fund which grew by 5.9 per cent to Rs. 293.7

billion in 2021 from Rs. 277.4 billion in 2020.

Dividend income increased by 124.0 per cent to

Rs. 6.7 billion in 2021 compared to Rs. 3.0 billion

in 2020. Net Gain/Loss on financial instruments at

fair value through profit or loss recorded a net gain

of Rs. 41.8 billion in 2021 compared to net gain of

Rs. 5.0 billion in 2020.

Overall Return of the Fund: The Fund earned

a total gross income of Rs. 342.4 billion in

2021, recording an increase of 19.9 per cent

compared to the previous year. After adjusting

for operating expenditure and tax expenditure, the

net profit for the year 2021 was Rs. 299.1 billion

which is an increase of 22.1 per cent compared

to that of 2020. Accordingly, the Return on

Average Investment of the EPF in 2021 was 11.40

per cent. Further, the Fund was able to maintain

operating expenses to gross income ratio at 0.48

per cent in 2021. However, the tax expenditure of

the Fund increased by Rs. 2.6 billion compared

to 2020 following the increase of profit in 2021.

Nevertheless, the adoption of SLFRS 9, the

Accounting Standard applicable for classification

and measurement of Financial Instruments, where

listed equity instruments are measured at fair

value and also due to the favourable performance

observed in the listed equity market, a net gain

of Rs. 41.8 billion was recorded as an income for

the year 2021. Accordingly, the EPF declared an

interest rate of around 9.00 per cent on member

balances in 2021.

Activities of the EPF Department were

conducted while adhering to the risk management

and internal control requirements in place, even

while experiencing certain disruptions during

the year to its regular operating mechanisms

due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, all

investment activities were conducted in line with

the requirements specified in the Monetary Board

approved Investment Policy Statement, Strategic

Asset Allocation and Investment Guidelines,

while ensuring the safety and optimal return to

the Fund. The investment climate prevailed in

the country during the year was quite challenging

due to significant changes in the market interest

rates, fluctuations in the equity market and

other economic conditions. Accordingly, robust

investment decisions were taken while addressing

any risks of the changing economic environment.

Further, actions were taken to revisit and revise

the prevailing investment guidelines in order to

facilitate investment decisions considering the

market conditions, international standards and

best practices with the collaboration of Risk

Management Department of the Central Bank.

Employees’ Trust Fund

The ETF, which contributed to 10.8

per cent of the asset base of the

superannuation sector, recorded an

improvement in its asset base, total

contributions, and investments while the

number of member accounts registered a

decline. Out of 14.7 million member accounts of

the ETF, only 2.1 million accounts were active as at

end 2021. The number of employers contributing to

the fund declined to 44,501 at end 2021 from 75,756

at end 2020. The total member balance of the ETF

increased by 8.3 per cent year-on-year to reach Rs.

406.3 billion at end 2021. The total contributions

received to the ETF increased by 11 per cent

year-on-year and reached Rs. 29.7 billion, while total

benefits paid to members increased by 6.6 per cent

year-on-year and reached Rs. 20.2 billion at end

2021.

Meanwhile, the total assets of the ETF

increased by 11.3 per cent year-on-year

and reached Rs. 419.1 billion at end 2021.

Investments made by the ETF increased to

Rs. 410.1 billion at end 2021, which is an increase

of 10.5 per cent compared to end 2020. Out of

these investments, 86 per cent was invested in

government securities at end 2021, compared to

80 per cent at end of the previous year. The share

of investments in fixed deposits considerably

decreased to 6.9 per cent at end 2021 compared

to 14.3 per cent at end 2020. The ETF managed

to pay a return of 7.3 per cent on its member

balances for 2021, a decline from the 8 per cent of

return paid during the previous year.

Other Superannuation Funds

The PSPF, which accounted for 2.2

per cent of the superannuation sector,

increased in terms of assets, investments, and

net contribution during 2021. The fund grew

by 19.1 per cent and reached Rs. 83.5 billion in

terms of assets at end 2021. The number of active

members of the fund was 241,384 at end 2021

when compared to 235,884 active members at

end 2020. Meanwhile, the investments of the

fund also grew by 16.4 per cent reaching Rs. 81

billion at end 2021. The PSPF has invested 57.4

per cent of its total investments in government

securities while other investments accounted for

42.6 per cent of the total investments as at end

2021. The net contribution was Rs. 835 million

during 2021 compared to the net contribution of

Rs. 507 million reported during the previous year.

The rate of return on member balances was 8

per cent in 2021 compared to 9.75 per cent in

2020.

Approved Pension and Provident Funds

(APPFs) accounted for 5.4 per cent of the

superannuation sector by end 2021. The

number of members covered by APPFs was

estimated to be 76,692 and total assets of the

funds were estimated to be Rs. 207.6 billion at

end 2021.

transactions by the Central Bank. However, surplus

liquidity in the domestic money market declined

thereafter, mainly due to foreign loan repayments

by the Government, currency withdrawals by LCBs,

maturities of Treasury bills held by the Central

Bank, and maturing of foreign currency buy-sell

swap transactions of the Central Bank with LCBs.

With the reversal of the accommodative monetary

policy stance in mid-August 2021 and the increase

of the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) by 2.00

percentage points to 4.00 per cent with effect from

the reserve maintenance period commencing 01

September 2021, liquidity of the domestic money

market declined significantly. Accordingly, market

liquidity, which remained at a surplus of Rs. 206.8

billion by end 2020, recorded a deficit of Rs. 119.6

billion by end September 2021. As guided by the

monetary policy stance, a deficit was maintained in

the overnight money market liquidity through open

market operations by conducting repo auctions

since late August 2021. Moreover, the Central

Bank conducted auctions of outright sales of

Treasury bills in November and December 2021,

in order to mop up excess liquidity on a permanent

basis, resulting mainly from primary purchases of

Treasury bills by the Central Bank and special

allocations of Treasury bills to the Central Bank,

thereby curbing any downward pressure on the

Average Weighted Call Money Rate (AWCMR).

Meanwhile, the Central Bank conducted term

reverse repo auctions, on two occasions, to ease

liquidity pressures experienced by certain banks,

towards the second half of 2021. However, by end

2021, domestic money market liquidity recorded a

deficit of Rs. 366.2 billion.

Money Market Interest Rates

AWCMR, which is the operating target of the

monetary policy framework, moved gradually

towards the upper bound of the Standing

Rate Corridor (SRC) with the tightening of

money market liquidity conditions since 2021,

alongside the upward adjustment of policy

interest rates in August 2021. Since mid-July

2021, AWCMR remained above the middle of

the SRC in line with the declining money market

liquidity. Accordingly, other short term money

market rates also showed an upward adjustment

from July 2021 onwards. Increased borrowings

a certain extent. The depreciation pressure was

largely abated by the significant supply of foreign

exchange liquidity, through substantial outright

interventions along with a series of bilateral

sell-buy foreign exchange swap transactions,

to facilitate essential import bills by the Central

Bank. Since early September 2021, following the

Central Bank’s instructions to all banks to execute

FX transactions within the USD/LKR exchange

rate between Rs. 200 - Rs. 203, the average

spot exchange rate in the domestic interbank

FX market hovered within the specified range.

Meanwhile, a number of incentive schemes were

introduced in line with the policy directions taken

by the Government and the Central Bank to foster

foreign exchange conversions while attracting

more foreign exchange inflows to the country. In

line with the overall depreciation of Sri Lankan

rupee against the US dollar, the average US dollar

buying and selling exchange rates of commercial

banks for telegraphic transfers as of end 2021 were

at Rs. 198.50 and Rs. 203.00, whilst comparative

figures in end 2020 were at Rs. 184.12 and

Rs. 189.18, respectively. Meanwhile, during the

year 2021, the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated

against the sterling pound, the Indian rupee and

the Australian dollar.

The Central Bank was a net seller in the

domestic forex market in 2021. Despite the

modest purchases of foreign exchange from

banks, mainly under the requirement imposed

on banks to sell a certain percentage of foreign

exchange to the Central Bank of converted

workers’ remittances and to mandatorily convert

export proceeds to build up the gross official

reserve position, the Central Bank significantly

supplied foreign exchange to the market to

facilitate essential imports. This supply of foreign

exchange by the Central Bank helped address

the foreign exchange liquidity shortage in the

domestic foreign exchange market to a limited

few foreign banks as well as the exposure limits

applicable for money market transactions among

market participants contributed to the increase in

domestic money market interest rates. Further,

with the upward adjustment in policy interest rates

by 50 basis points on 19 August 2021, AWCMR

increased further and remained at 5.94 per cent

at end September 2021. However, by end 2021,

AWCMR broadly stabilised closer to the upper

bound of the SRC. The Average Weighted Repo

Rate (AWRR) also moved in line with AWCMR

during this period. As at end 2021, AWCMR and

AWRR stood at 5.95 per cent and 5.98 per cent,

respectively.

Domestic Foreign Exchange Market

During 2021, the Sri Lanka rupee depreciated

against the US dollar by 7 per cent from

Rs. 186.41 as at end 2020 to Rs. 200.43 as at

end 2021. The exchange rate, which levelled

off around Rs. 186 at the beginning of the year,

came under pressure during the first quarter

of the year with the elevated demand in the

foreign exchange market mainly due to high

import volumes and continuous external debt

service payment requirements despite the limited

supply caused by the effects of the COVID-19

pandemic such as the delay in the revival of

tourism industry, comparatively low remittances

and restricted access to international capital

markets amidst consecutive sovereign rating

downgrades. The persistent liquidity shortage in

the domestic forex market was further aggravated

by lower exporter conversions and divergence

of workers’ remittances into informal channels

with the emergence of shadow foreign exchange

markets. Since the end of April 2021, banks

mutually agreed to execute FX transactions within

the USD/LKR exchange rate band of Rs. 200 -

Rs. 203, in order to curb the depreciation pressure

and market speculation on the exchange rate to

extent. Accordingly, the Central Bank absorbed

US dollars 506 million and supplied US dollars

1,253 million, resulting in a net sale of US dollars

747 million in 2021.

Moreover, with the objective of attracting

more FX inflows to the country and thereby to

improve the liquidity in the domestic FX market,

the Government together with the Central

Bank, offered several incentives for workers’

remittances channelled through the formal

banking sector. The public were also incentivised

with a number of temporary measures, including

an additional Rs. 10 per US dollar, when converting

their foreign currency notes into Sri Lanka rupees.

In 2021, the total volume of inter-bank

foreign exchange transactions amounted to US

dollars 12.2 billion, compared to US dollars 18.4

billion in 2020. Accordingly, trading volumes in

the domestic foreign exchange inter-bank market

declined by 33.9 per cent compared to that of

2020. In line with this development, the average

daily volumes in the inter-bank foreign exchange

market declined to US dollars 50 million in 2021

from US dollars 77 million in 2020.

Government Securities Market

The yield curve of government securities

increased and settled at higher levels towards the

latter part of 2021. The yield rates of government

securities adjusted upward in response to the

monetary policy actions in August 2021 with a

50 basis point increase in the policy rates and

a 200 basis point increase in the SRR. Another

round of upward adjustments in yield rates was

observed with the removal of the announcement

of maximum acceptance yield rates in September

2021, coupled with negative sovereign rating

actions and increased government borrowings

amid allocations of unsubscribed Treasury bills to

the Central Bank.

At the primary auctions of Treasury bills, the

market preference was towards 91-day maturity,

particularly towards the latter part of the year.

On the contrary, the longer tenure Treasury bonds

were preferred by investors in general at the primary

auctions. The short term 91-day Treasury bill yield

rates remained broadly stable towards the end of

2021 at 8.16 per cent while benchmark 182-day

and 364-day remained at 8.33 per cent and 8.24

per cent, respectively. However, 91-day, 182-day

and 364-day Treasury bill yield rates increased

by 314, 334 and 324 basis points respectively

as at end 2021 from end 2020. The yield rates of

Treasury bonds also increased noticeably during

Developing and implementing a National

Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) for Sri Lanka

was identified during the recent past as a key

focus area of the country in order to achieve the

Sustainable Development Goals. The Central

Bank successfully launched the NFIS of Sri Lanka

in March 2021 and several actions were taken to

operationalise the implementation of the NFIS to

identify and promote financial inclusion across the

country. In recognition of the need for improving

financial education as a priority action across all

policy pillars of the NFIS, an island wide financial

literacy survey was successfully completed

in 2021, and the modules and educational

materials are being developed by the Ministry of

Education in collaboration with the Central Bank

and other relevant stakeholders to incorporate

financial education into the school curriculum as

a compulsory subject starting from Grade 6 to 11.

Financial literacy is one of the main pillars

identified under the NFIS and a main role has

to be played by the Regional Development

Department (RDD) of the Central Bank in order

to enhance financial literacy of the country’s

people. With the objective of enhancing financial

literacy throughout the country, RDD initiated

several programmes during the year with the

support of 6 Regional Offices of the Central

Bank. Accordingly, 08 Training of Trainers (TOT)

discussions, 17 Radio and TV programmes, 07

knowledge sharing programmes and more than

330 financial literacy, entrepreneurship and skill

development programmes were conducted in

2021. Amidst the constraints associated with

widespread uncertainties of the COVID-19

pandemic, several programmes were carried

out as online programmes utilising the newly

developed online oriented training and awareness

materials.

a range of credit supplementary services during

2021. Total loans released during 2021 was

Rs. 27,268 million among 80,899 beneficiaries

through Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs)

under 14 refinance loan schemes and 6 interest

subsidy and credit guarantee schemes of which

58 per cent accounted for refinance schemes and

42 per cent accounted for interest subsidy and

credit guarantee schemes.

Extraordinary measures were taken by

the Central Bank to cope with the COVID-19

Pandemic. The Central Bank continued to

implement several extraordinary policy measures

throughout the year providing concessions

to businesses and individuals affected by the

pandemic. Accordingly, moratoria were offered for

the concessionary credit schemes implemented

by the Central Bank viz extending the repayment

period up to 36 months from 24 months and grace

period until 30 September 2021 and subsequently

extended until 31 December 2021. Further, the

tourism sector was facilitated with extraordinary

measures by extending the grace period for loans

until 30 June 2022. The Central Bank continued

to support MSMEs by providing moratoria and

implemented several credit schemes. With the

intention of establishing market driven value

chain financing in the country, the Central Bank

implemented a Domestic Agriculture Development

programme (DAD-PP) as a pilot project to identify

gaps and opportunities to develop a comprehensive

value chain programme for the agriculture sector

in Sri Lanka. Further, Operating Instructions

were issued to introduce and implement a credit

guarantee and interest subsidy scheme for MSME

rice mill owners and intensification of shrimp

farms in Sri Lanka. A credit guarantee and interest

subsidy scheme to enhance the dairy farming and

developing MSMEs were initiated in 2021.

Introduction

Financial inclusion can be broadly defined as the state, where individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs – transactions, payments, savings, credit and insurance – delivered in a responsible and sustainable way.1 Financial inclusion is also identified as inclusive finance, since it strives to remove barriers for individuals and businesses to participate in the formal financial sector and to use financial services to improve their sources of income and standards of living.

The concept of financial inclusion has become a central part of global policy agenda since early 2000. Many countries use financial inclusion as an effort to promote a level playing field for individuals and businesses to work towards elevating themselves out of poverty and contribute to sustainable economic growth. Increasing access to financial services and products for those who are excluded from the financial sector enables them to plan and better manage their finances, while opening up opportunities for better standards of living. Access to finance for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) encourages them to invest in new and more productive business activities, contributing to economic growth while generating employment opportunities. Although, financial inclusion alone cannot elevate people out of poverty, it helps to promote building better lives. Further, the importance of financial inclusion is now widely recognized in building a strong foundation of a country’s financial stability, which in turn will facilitate inclusive economic development. In this regard, upgrading financial inclusion concepts and efforts to the policy platforms requires assessment and quantification of level of financial inclusion and careful scrutinisation of the actual requirements of the economy and the individuals.

In this backdrop, assessment of the level of financial inclusion in Sri Lanka has been carried out by the Sri Lankan policy makers with the intention to set targets at national level and to monitor the progress of the financial inclusion initiatives under three dimensions:

BOX 10National Financial Inclusion Strategy of Sri Lanka: “Better Quality Inclusion for Better Lives”

“Access” dimension reflects the depth of outreach of financial services, i.e. penetration of bank branches, ATMs or Point of Sale (POS) devices, or demand-side barriers faced by customers to access financial institutions, such as cost or information. “Usage” dimension reflects how customers use financial services, such as the frequency and duration of the financial product/service over time. “Quality” of the products and the service delivery describe the availability of choices to meet the needs of the customer, as well as aspects of financial consumer protection and the degree of the awareness and understanding of financial products and services.2

Where does Sri Lanka Stand on Financial Inclusion?

Sri Lanka’s long-standing efforts to increase financial inclusion date back to the early 20th century. As a result of these efforts, Sri Lanka has made significant advancements in financial inclusion. According to the National Financial Inclusion Survey conducted by CBSL, supported by International Finance Corporation (IFC), World Bank Group, in 2018, account ownership in Sri Lanka stands at 88 per cent, which is higher than the South Asia average.3 Noticeably, it has been reported of having no gender disparity or any significant difference in account ownership among less advantaged segments of the population, including rural residents, or low-income people. Sri Lanka also enjoys high level of bank branch penetration, with bank branch density of 16.4 branches per 100,000 adults as of December 2021.4 However, in contrast to the high literacy level (92.9%5) among the Sri Lankans, the low level of financial literacy (35%6) has been recognized among certain pockets as an impediment to the universal achievements.

More broadly, despite high levels of access, usage of accounts and uptake of other financial products and services such as mobile money, insurance, retirement schemes and bond and equity instruments are modest. More importantly, access to appropriate credit products from formal providers remains a significant barrier for both individuals and MSMEs.7 Although, urban and industry MSMEs get better access to formal financial sources, small scale village based MSMEs are often denied of access to financial facilities in Sri Lanka. As a result, vulnerable groups have been forced to resort

The NFIS clearly defines a set of specific policy objectives that are centered around four key policy pillars.

I. Digital Finance and Payments, II. Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Finance, III. Consumer Protection and IV. Financial Literacy and Capacity Building.

A set of core enablers has also been identified to support achieving progress in these focus areas, namely; Data, Infrastructure and Policy Tools and Enabling Regulatory Environment.

The Framework of the NFIS

By assessing the current state of financial inclusion and identifying obstacles and opportunities relevant to each pillar, necessary policy initiatives have been identified and the Action Plan of the NFIS has been formulated accordingly to achieve higher level of financial inclusion. The Action plan comprises a set of sequenced and time-bound actions with clear indication of institutional level responsibilities.

In operationalising the NFIS of Sri Lanka, a governance structure comprising 04 levels of entities has been established. The National Council at the top level is to provide overall policy guidance relevant to implementation of the NFIS with the Management Committee entrusted to oversee the day-to-day implementation of the NFIS and to provide regular updates to the National Council. Meanwhile, Working Groups under each policy pillar are to serve as consultation forums with the NFIS Secretariat established at the CBSL to ensure coordination and monitoring across different implementing entities to

to the informal sector, thereby exposing them to higher risks, difficulties due to financial malpractices and make them more vulnerable to poverty. The potential for further growth in usage of digital payments and other Digital Financial Services has been highlighted by the National Financial Inclusion Survey 2018. However, the nation has failed in reaping maximum possible benefits to a sustainable extent, due to lack of financial skills and capability to make use of available financial products and services. Lack of an effective regulatory authority and legal protection for affected groups have been the major factors that have contributed to the financial exclusion practices observed in Sri Lanka.

In this context, the formulation of the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) of Sri Lanka is considered as a timely initiative, bringing together all key stakeholders for the first time to carry out a long-term, comprehensive and coordinated strategy for achieving financial inclusion in Sri Lanka. The development of the NFIS has been led by the CBSL with the collaboration of all stakeholders, including government institutions, formal financial service providers and other relevant professional bodies. The NFIS was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in March 2020 and launched in March 2021 by the CBSL and currently in operation in collaboration with more than 20 implementing entities.

NFIS Policy Framework and Implementation

The aim of the NFIS is to provide a long-term, comprehensive, standardised and well-coordinated approach for all stakeholders to move towards improving the financial inclusiveness of the country.

The vision of the NFIS of Sri Lanka provides the strategic direction for the priorities of the Strategy, that reflects the aspirational, long-term goal that stakeholders of the NFIS seek to collaboratively achieve.

"Better quality inclusion for better lives"

All individuals and enterprises in Sri Lanka have well-informed, fair and equitable access to a range of high-quality, appropriate, secure and affordable financial products and services that they can use to contribute to economic growth and improve their standard of living.

The vision incorporates important concepts beyond simple “access” to financial services, where prevalence of enabling environment for well-informed consumers to select and use financial products and services appropriately. The NFIS focuses on ensuring expanded access to high-quality financial products that are appropriately designed, affordable and delivered through formal financial sector.

Sri Lanka’s country definition of financial inclusion is aligned with the vision of the NFIS, which recognised financial inclusion is not as a stand-alone goal, yet lead to positive economic and social impact to the community.

secure achieving NFIS targets within the intended time frame.

NFIS Governance Structure

The National Results Framework of NFIS under the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system explicitly articulates the expected outcomes throughout the process with the key objectives of financial inclusion translated into measurable indicators. Encompassing all policy areas, the need of improving financial education has been highlighted as a priority action in the overall process. Prioritising the actions introduced under the policy areas of financial literacy and capacity building, respective stakeholders are actively collaborated in implementing the actions. As a timely and an effective policy tool to ensure financial inclusion among future generations, the Ministry of Education has undertaken several measures along with relevant stakeholders in order to incorporate the financial education into school curriculum as a compulsory element from grade 6 to 11.

In order to standardise the adult’s financial education programmes, education modules on financial literacy and digital literacy were developed and Training of Trainers (TOT) programs are being rolled out. Further, an island wide financial literacy survey was conducted in 2021 to assess the level of financial literacy of the country. The data collected through the survey will be used to assess the level of financial literacy among Sri Lankans. The survey has been designed according to standard financial literacy score system recognized internationally under three key elements of financial knowledge, financial behavior and financial attitudes. Considering the importance of moving towards a single direction, a coordination mechanism is being developed to improve synergies across all the stakeholder entities conducting financial literacy programmes and MSME support programmes. Going beyond, the proposed Financial Literacy and Capacity Building Road Map will set out the strategic direction and principles for development and implementation of financial education and MSME support programmes.

How NFIS will support achieving the financial inclusion goals in Sri Lanka ?

The strategy is not limited to improving the overall national financial inclusion level, but also is aimed at reducing disparities in levels of financial inclusion combined with social and demographic attributes such as income, geographical location, age, gender etc., by the conclusion of the NFIS.

It is expected to increase access to financial products and services that help unserved and underserved segments to improve their financial resilience. Further, with the increased access to finance, MSMEs will grow and become more productive towards generating income and creating more formal employment opportunities.

In parallel, with well-designed, coordinated and comprehensive financial literacy initiatives will broader the right financial knowledge, skills and behavior of financial consumers and will ensure the ability of future Sri Lankans to meet their basic financial needs. More financially capable and empowered consumers will eventually promote good market conduct and improve financial services, resulting in a virtuous cycle for financial inclusion. Through the NFIS, consumer protection will also be reinforced by having appropriate regulatory environment to strengthen the market conduct of all types of financial service providers. The best practices to be established for well-being of customers, while increasing trust of consumers facilitating the broader objective of financial system stability.

The significant improvements in the digital finance ecosystem on the other hand, will be a boon for financial inclusion, as they facilitate significant cost efficiencies and viable delivery of financial services to the low-income individuals and small enterprises of the society complemented by a more conducive regulatory environment and necessary digital infrastructure, enabling market players to deliver more innovative financial services.

8.6 Financial Infrastructure

Payment and Settlement Systems

Amidst several waves of the COVID-19

pandemic during 2021, the Central Bank

continued to facilitate economic activities

by ensuring uninterrupted payment and

settlement services in the country. The Central

Bank continued to regulate and supervise the

payment and settlement systems in the country to

facilitate an efficient and secure national payment

infrastructure.

The LankaSettle System, which consists

of the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)

System, and the LankaSecure System operated

smoothly to accommodate the increasing

transaction volumes during the period under

review. The value of RTGS transactions recorded

a significant increase of 96.3 percent during 2021.

In value terms, the share of RTGS transactions

in total non-cash payments accounted for 94

per cent during the period under review. The

Central Bank continued to provide the interest

free Intra-day Liquidity Facility (ILF) against

the collateral of government securities to the

Participating Institutions (PI) of the RTGS System

to avoid any disruptions that could arise due to any

liquidity issues of PIs. During 2021, the Central

Bank released a daily average value of Rs. 208.5

billion per business day to PIs who requested the

ILF.

The aggregate of Scripless Securities

held in LankaSecure as at end 2021 was

Rs. 9,238.6 billion (Face Value) which comprised

of Treasury bills and Treasury bonds worth

Rs. 2,270.7 billion and Rs. 6,967.9 billion,

respectively. LankaSecure facilitated transactions3

amounting to Rs. 262.8 trillion during 2021.

3 The LankaSecure system settles all government securities related transactions including transactions of primary issuances, secondary market trades (outright, repurchase trans-actions, pledge transactions), Open Market Operations, and Intra-Day Liquidity Facility.

During 2021, the Cheque Clearing System

of the country operated by LankaClear (Pvt.)

Ltd (LCPL) cleared a total volume of 33 million

cheques amounting to Rs. 8,311.5 billion. Even

though the volume of cheques cleared by LCPL

demonstrates a marginal decrease of 1.8 per cent,

the value of the cheques recorded a 11 per cent

growth compared to the previous year.

The Sri Lanka Interbank Payment System

(SLIPS), which is operated by LCPL, mainly

facilitates low value retail bulk payments, and

recorded a growth in terms of both the volume

and value of payments by 13.7 per cent and

26.8 per cent to 41.9 million and Rs. 2,862.2

billion, respectively, during 2021.

Common ATM Switch (CAS), the first

phase of Common Card and Payment Switch

(CCAPS), enables cash withdrawals and

balance inquiries from any Automated Teller

Machine (ATM) connected to the CAS network.

The transaction volume of CAS increased by 18.8

per cent to 58.2 million, while the value of CAS

transactions increased by 32.4 per cent to Rs. 671

billion, respectively, during the period under review.

As at end 2021, 29 financial institutions were

integrated to the CAS network. Shared ATM Switch,

which was launched in 2015 to provide services to

financial institutions, which do not have the capacity

to operate their own card management system, had

two members and continued its operations smoothly

during the review period.

Common Electronic Fund Transfer Switch

(CEFTS), which was launched in 2015, facilitates

retail fund transfers among member institutions

on a real time basis. The volume of CEFTS

transactions demonstrated a significant growth of

97.8 per cent from 27.6 million to 54.7 million, while

the CEFTS transaction value increased by 104

per cent to Rs. 4,926.6 billion from Rs. 2,415.3 billion

during 2021. This was mainly due to the promotional

per cent to Rs. 2,487 million, respectively, with

126,670 joining as new LANKAQR merchants.

With the aim of popularising LANKAQR payments

among small and medium merchants as well as

consumers, the “LANKAQR Nationwide Rollout

Campaign” was launched in October 2021.

Further, the maximum Merchant Discount Rate of

0.5 per cent for LANKAQR initiated transactions

was extended until further notice to encourage

merchants to accept LANKAQR as a payment

mode.

The Central Bank continued its regulatory

and supervisory activities with regard

to payment cards and mobile payment

systems, in terms of the provisions of the

Payment Cards and Mobile Payment Systems

Regulations No. 1 of 2013. Accordingly, two

financial institutions were licensed to function as

issuers of debit cards as per the Regulations. Due

to the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic and

the Government imposing travel restrictions, virtual

onsite supervision was carried out with respect to a

service provider of mobile payment systems while

off-site supervision was strengthened to continue

to monitor compliance with the regulations imposed

on service providers of payment cards and mobile

payment systems to ensure smooth functioning of

licensed service providers.

The Central Bank successfully concluded

the deployment and testing of the Proof of

The National Payments Council (NPC), the

industry consultative and monitoring committee

on payment and settlement systems continued

to monitor the Payment System Road Map for

campaigns conducted continuously by the Central

Bank and financial institutions to promote digital

payment methods and consumers switching to

digital payment methods since the Government

reimposed travel restrictions due to the COVID-19

pandemic.

EPF, Import and Export Control Department,

Sri Lanka Standard Institution and the

Department of Inland Revenue also joined the

LankaPay Online Payment Platform (LPOPP),

which was launched in order to facilitate

online payments to government institutions

via CEFTS during the period under review. The

LPOPP transaction volume significantly increased

by 433.9 per cent, from 96,258 transactions to

513,961 transactions, while the LPOPP transaction

value grew from Rs. 75.3 billion to Rs. 198.2 billion

by 163.1 per cent during the period under review.

The increase in the volume and value of LPOPP

transactions was largely due to the increase in

transactions related to the Sri Lanka Customs and

the Department of Inland Revenue joining LPOPP

during the review period.

Introduction

Banking has had a close relationship with technology for decades, from computerised banking systems to automated teller machines (ATM) to internet banking systems. Adoption of technology has enabled banks to continuously increase efficiencies, lower intermediation cost, and increase profitability. The intensive use of technology by banks to increase profitability has attracted the attention of the technology investors and has created new business avenues, giving rise to the modern day’s FinTech industry.

FinTech or Financial technology as it is more formally known, has grown rapidly during the last decade and is now posing challenges to both traditional banking business models as well as traditional banking supervisory methodologies.

In addition to increased efficiencies, products and services enabled by FinTech also offer opportunities for unbanked and underbanked population, who may have limited or no access to banks, to receive traditional financial services through non-traditional channels. This is mainly due to the use of smart mobile phones as a primary channel to deliver FinTech based banking services and relatively high mobile phone penetration even among the underprivileged segments of population. Accordingly, it is evident that FinTech provides opportunities for more competition, increased efficiency, and reduced intermediation cost in banking business. However, complacency on the part of traditional banks will see them rapidly losing business to emerging FinTech driven companies as a result of flight to efficiency by banking customers.

The rapid emergence of FinTech has given rise to potential new risks relating to technology, data governance, and market conduct. This poses the need for a supervisory approach that supports fintech adoption by the banking industry. Such an approach needs to address relevant risks to protect consumers while fostering innovation and competition.

Fintech innovations that will impact traditional banking

Even though there are many FinTech innovations, some will significantly impact the traditional banking channel. Virtual banking, open banking, peer-to-peer lending, and digital currencies are four such FinTech innovations that have the potential to materially change the way traditional banking is conducted. These are explained in detail below:

Virtual banking

A bank that offers its services entirely through electronic channels without requiring physical interaction with

BOX 11The FinTech Invasion: Way forward for Banking Supervisors

customers is considered a virtual bank. This will provide significant cost savings due to reduced need for physical locations and staff. Both existing and newer banks are pursuing virtual banking due to the cost attractiveness. Customers of a virtual bank will be able to perform all banking activities from account opening to making deposits to borrowing funds via mobile application or through internet banking instead of visiting a bank branch. Virtual banking will also be one of the most convenient ways for traditional banks to successfully counter challenges emerging from FinTech driven banks and services offered by other FinTech businesses, due to the decision making and processing functions being similar for banking products offered through both traditional and virtual banking.

Open banking

Open banking allows consented third parties to access customer data in a bank using application programming interfaces (API). This enables third-party FinTech providers to present variety of solutions to consumers such as mobile applications that allow accessing banking data from different financial institutions and easily perform transactions using multiple banks. A bank that has enabled open banking will become significantly different from a traditional institution. Open banking puts customers in control of their data, which gives consumers the opportunity to take advantage of customized and precision designed financial services that their original bank could not offer initially. Accordingly, both individual customers and businesses will be able to manage their finances more efficiently with open banking. Even more importantly, open banking facilitate innovation in the FinTech industry, allowing new technologies to emerge and reengineer how financial services are offered by banks.

Peer-to-peer lending platforms

Peer-to-peer lending is probably the most direct challenge posed to the traditional banking model by emerging FinTech businesses. Peer-to-peer lending platforms intend to directly connect lenders and borrowers, thereby drastically reducing the cost of financial intermediation. The peer-to-peer lending platforms initially emerged as an alternative funding source for unbanked and underbanked customers who do not have access to bank lending. However, due to its cost efficiency peer-to-peer lending is now attracting usual customers of traditional banks as well. Even a medium scale migration of banking customers to peer-to-peer lending platforms will become a financial stability concern for banking supervisors, given that there are no prudential measures such as capital adequacy or liquidity requirements as well as safety net measures like deposit insurance for peer-to-peer lending activities.

Digital currencies

The emergence of digital currencies is probably the biggest FinTech driven challenge faced by traditional monetary and banking systems. Two types of digital currencies, cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), are likely to become significant as banking and financial transactions conducted by general public becomes more digital. Cryptocurrency is a digital asset that is secured by cryptography and operates using blockchain technology, which is a distributed ledger that utilizes a large decentralized network of computers. Cryptocurrencies are not issued by any central authority such as a Central Bank. This also make cryptocurrencies less affected by government interventions and thereby possibly impacting the effectiveness of central bank monetary policy. On the other hand, CBDCs that will be issued by a country’s monetary authority will act as a digital token of the country's official currency. As CBDCs are issued by a country’s monetary authority they are fully backed by the issuing government and will be under the full policy control of the issuing monetary authority.

What should be the regulatory and supervisory approach towards FinTech

The need to adopt an open yet cautious regulatory approach when facilitating banks’ adoption of FinTech

The rapid rise of FinTech raises questions to banking supervisors, such as the need to expand the supervisory limits to include new risks; whether existing regulations are adequate for newer types of digital financial services; and how to identify, monitor and mitigate the risks faced by banks due to FinTech innovations and exposures to FinTech businesses.

Further, FinTech driven products and services are heavily reliant on range of information systems and data connected to the internet. Therefore, technology, cybersecurity and data protection related risks associated with FinTech needs to be well understood and prudently managed.

However, it should be noted that excessive regulation and supervision may deter innovation and could place banks at a competitive disadvantage while also discouraging consumers. Therefore, banking supervisors need to carefully assess risks and benefits and avoid hindering required innovation.

There are two extremes in the supervisory approaches that could be taken by banking supervisors when it comes to the supervision of FinTech products and services. The first is the “laissez faire” approach, where innovation is permitted without any supervisory intervention up to the point where serious risks to the banking system emerge. The other extreme approach is to limit innovation only to products and services desired by the supervisors by enforcing regulations that limit innovation.

The need for supervisors to move on with Supervisory Technology (SupTech)

It is the responsibility of the banking supervisors to keep the banking system stable while utilizing the benefits of FinTech for the betterment of both the consumers and the banks. The current supervisory policies, techniques, and resources, that are designed to address risks posed by traditional banking channels, could be inadequate to address the risks introduced by FinTech. Further, the amount of resources of a banking supervisor is limited. Therefore, the adoption of supervisory practices that enable effective supervision, with the use of limited resources and a focus on risk and stability of financial institutions has become imperative.

These factors have required bank supervisors developing and implementing new technology based supervisory approaches, broadly referred to as Supervisory Technology or SupTech. The adoption of SupTech by banking supervisors will have a deep impact on how banks are supervised.

Essential SupTech capabilities for banking supervisors

Sophisticated supervisory information systems, advanced data analytic capabilities, and use of artificial intelligence to extract knowledge from relevant unstructured data sources are some of the key SupTech capabilities required for any modern banking supervisor. These are detailed below:

Supervisory information systems

A supervisory information system is an information system that facilitate collection, validation, and analytics of information reported by banks and other financial institutions. The features of such includes functionality for banks to submit data or for the supervisor to retrieve data; a data warehouse with facilities to store, manage, and secure documents and data; smaller databases or datamarts to enable data querying and analysis by different teams within the banking supervisor; and data analytics and business intelligence tools that enable generation of supervisory insights.

Advanced data analytics capabilities to generate accurate and timely early warning signals

Banking supervisors will benefit immensely by implementing advanced data analytics capabilities together with a supervisory information system. This will include capabilities for querying, analysis, and visualization of data. An analytics platform will facilitate end-to-end computation of both standardized and ad hoc data analysis requirements of bank supervisors.

A comprehensive data analytics platform will enable generation of early warnings for different risk categories, banks, and clusters of banks through predictive analytic

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

2688

models using structured data submitted by banks, data insights from credit bureau and other external data repositories, and macroeconomic forecasts. Such a platform will also enable the banking supervisors to conduct periodic forward looking stress tests based on macroeconomic forecasts and institutional trends.

Use of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate supervisory insights from public and non-public unstructured data

Fully developed data analytics capabilities should enable banking supervisors to conduct analysis and interpretation of both structured and unstructured data using conventional statistical tools as well as emerging artificial intelligence-based technologies. Accordingly, use of artificial intelligence based technologies by banking supervisors to generate supervisory insights from public and non-public unstructured data will focus on extracting knowledge from various unstructured (text based) data sources to augment structured data based analytics and computations already conducted on the data analytics platform including bank ratings and early warning computations.

Initiatives already taken by CBSL

CBSL has taken multiple steps to facilitate FinTech as well as to address the key risks. Some of these initiatives are detailed below:

Regulatory framework on technology risk management and resilience

The CBSL in 2021 introduced regulatory framework on technology risk management and resilience as a set of minimum regulatory requirements for licensed banks. The key characteristics of the framework are the introduction of enhanced information security, system availability, and resilience requirements for critical information systems, enhanced information security requirements for sensitive data, and higher risk management measures for domestic systemically important banks.

The components of the regulatory framework include requirements relating to governance framework for technology risk management, information security, information system availability and disaster recovery, staff competencies, compliance with international standards, and use of third-party infrastructure including cloud computing.

Proof-of-concept (POC) on KYC data sharing

In 2021, CBSL also completed the process of developing and testing a Blockchain technology based shared Know-Your-Customer (KYC) Proof-of-Concept (POC) solution. The purpose of developing a Blockchain Technology based POC of an industry-wide Shared KYC process was to assess the potential to improve customer experience, lower operational costs and reduce the operational risk of banks and other financial institutions.

It is expected that digitalization of the KYC process, especially with user friendly and secure designs, would encourage customers to use digital financial services and increase their access to financial services.

The findings demonstrated several salient features of Blockchain Technology that enabled secure and efficient sharing of customer KYC information between banks. This was a pioneering national project initiated by the CBSL that drew the voluntary participation of the Banking Industry and the Information Technology Industry to collaboratively explore the potential of Blockchain Technology to enable innovations in many financial services.

Regulatory sandbox

In 2020, CBSL commenced operations of a FinTech Regulatory sandbox with the objective of encouraging and enabling FinTech initiatives that promote greater efficiency and increased access to financial products and services. The sandbox is intended to provide a safe space for selected innovators to test their products and services, without the risk of infringing on regulatory requirements.

Way Forward

In order to obtain the maximum economic benefits from FinTech while ensuring that it does not impact the financial system stability adversly, the financial sector regulators will need to adopt a two-fold approach. The financial regulators shall make necessary changes to the regulatory framework to ensure that the regulatory environment facilitates FinTech innovations appropriately, while risks posed by such innovations are adequately monitored and mitigated. Further, such FinTech enabling regulatory framework shall need to be continuously evolving to reflect the changes introduced by rapidly developing FinTech industry. On the other hand, the supervisory capacity of banking supervisors needs to be significantly enhanced by moving to more technology based and automated supervisory methodologies. These will include implementing modern supervisory information systems, developing advanced data analytics capabilities, and introducing artificial intelligence assisted supervisory technology (SupTech) tools. Such a supervisory environment will enable the banking supervisors to effectively supervise the banking system in a FinTech driven era.

Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism

The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the

Central Bank performed its key role of receiving,

analysing, and disseminating information on

suspicious financial transactions relating to

Money Laundering/Terrorist Financing (ML/TF)

or any other unlawful activity. During the year

2021, FIU received 4,696 Suspicious Transaction

Reports (STRs) and Information Requests from

Reporting Institutions (RIs), Law Enforcement

Agencies (LEAs), Regulatory Authorities (RAs) and

the general public. After conducting operational

and strategic analyses of the STRs received, 1,830

STRs were referred where necessary to relevant

LEAs and RAs for further investigation or regulatory

actions. In the period under review, 2,220 STRs

were kept under surveillance and 641 STRs were

kept for initial analysis and further studies, while

the remaining STRs were categorised as no further

action required. Further, in terms of Section 6 of

the Financial Transactions Reporting Act (FTRA)

No. 6 of 2006, FIU received 5.7 million (provisional)

Cash Transactions Reports (CTRs) and 9.2

million (provisional) Electronic Fund Transfers

(EFTs-inwards and outwards) exceeding the

reporting threshold of Rs. 1 million or its equivalent

in any foreign currency from RIs, during the year

2021.

FIU continued conducting risk based

Anti-Money Laundering/Terrorist Financing

(AML/CFT) supervision during the year in

order to ensure institutional compliance with

the AML/CFT legal framework of the country.

Risk based examinations were conducted in

Financial Institutions (FIs) as well as Designated

Non-Finance Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs)

in Sri Lanka. Despite certain difficulties faced in

conducting the planned onsite examinations due to

the pandemic situation, FIU successfully conducted

2 risk based onsite examinations, 7 joint risk based

onsite examinations and 7 spot examinations.

Further, 4 offsite follow-up examinations were

initiated to assess AML/CFT compliance of FIs.

Moreover, 5 thematic reviews were conducted

on FIs, and 2 thematic reviews were conducted

on DNFBPs to assess the sector wide AML/CFT

compliance. Based on the examinations conducted

in 2021, administrative penalties amounting to

Rs. 10.5 million were imposed on 4 LCBs and 5

LFCs on violations of Customer Due Diligence

(CDD) Rules in relation to the United Nations

sanctions screening, customer identification and

verification, Suspicious Transactions Reporting and

implementation of proper risk controls and mitigation

measures. In addition, 9 show cause letters and

5 warning letters were issued during the year to

FIs on non-compliance with the provisions of the

FTRA and CDD Rules, regulations and guidelines

issued thereunder. The AML/CFT supervision of

DNFBPs was further strengthened by implementing

continuous measures to enhance the number of

DNFBP institutions for AML/CFT compliance.

Several initiatives were taken to introduce

legislative amendments to the legal framework

on AML/CFT with the objective of improving

the effectiveness of the AML/CFT regime of the

country during the year 2021. Furthermore, FIU

initiated updating the National Risk Assessment

(NRA) on ML/TF with technical assistance from the

World Bank, in compliance with Recommendation 1 of

the Financial Action Task Force Recommendations.

The NRA working groups consist of 66 public and

private stakeholder agencies with more than 123

officials.

FIU initiated various steps to enhance

awareness among all stakeholders involved.

In order to strengthen the AML/ CFT supervision

process and institutional compliance, FIU issued

several guidelines and circulars and provided

resource assistance to 50 awareness/training

programmes during the year.

Legal Reforms Related to the Financial Sector

The Central Bank continued introducing

law reforms to major pieces of legislation

administered with the view of providing a

stronger legal foundation for the regulatory and

supervisory framework of the Central Bank. As

such, the Central Bank concluded the second round

of discussions pertaining to a new Banking Act in

2021 with the expectation of further strengthening

and streamlining the provisions of the Banking Act

on par with international standards. In addition, to

enhance regulatory and supervisory powers of the

Central Bank over the non-bank financial institutions

including the resolution authority of the Central Bank,

necessary amendments to the Finance Business

Act, No. 42 of 2011 were prepared by the Central

Bank.

The Central Bank also engaged in

developing new pieces of legislation, namely,

the Trading, Clearing and Netting Act, Financial

Assets Management Act and Microfinance and

Credit Regulatory Authority Act. The objective of

introducing a new Trading, Clearing and Netting Act

for Sri Lanka is to provide for enhanced regulations

on trading, clearing, netting, settlement, and

custody related to the transactions of government

securities and foreign exchange. This Act primarily

focuses on introducing a comprehensive legal and

technological infrastructure that may transform

the markets for government securities and

foreign exchange into safer, modern, competitive,

and fair marketplaces supported by modern

post-trade clearing, central counterparty systems,

multi-currency RTGS System, etc. The Financial

Assets Management Act was developed with

the aim of introducing a concept based legal

framework to establish financial asset management

companies in Sri Lanka with a view of easing the

burden of the balance sheets of regulated financial

institutions caused by underperforming assets.

The new Microfinance and Credit Regulatory

Authority Act was drafted in order to establish a

separate regulatory authority for the regulation

and supervision of business of money lending

and business of microfinance to ensure consumer

protection.

In addition, amendments were proposed

by the Central Bank to the Registered Stock

and Securities Ordinance, No. 07 of 1937

and subsidiary pieces of legislation issued

thereunder to strengthen the issuance

procedure of Treasury bonds and to improve

investor confidence in the government

securities market in Sri Lanka. Moreover,

amendments to the Foreign Exchange Act, No. 12

of 2017 were proposed with a view of facilitating the

smooth functioning of the foreign exchange market

and strengthening the regulatory powers.

The Central Bank contributed to review

legislation that is relevant to the Central Bank

and the financial sector drafted by several

other stakeholders, such as the Colombo Port

City Economic Commission Bill, Coronavirus

Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Temporary

Provisions) Bill, Finance Bill, Data Protection

Bill, National Savings Bank Act, and the Bank

of Ceylon Ordinance. During such reviews,

the Central Bank assessed the impact of said

enactments/amendments to the existing regulatory

and supervisory framework of the Central Bank

given the national importance embedded therein. In

order to maintain the resilience of public confidence

towards the financial system, the Central Bank

continued litigation related to unauthorised finance

companies, prohibited schemes and other issues

in the financial sector, with the assistance of the

Attorney General’s Department and other Law

Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) under the provisions

of the Finance Business Act, No.42 of 2011 and the

Banking Act, No. 30 of 1988.

Financial Consumer Protection

The financial consumer protection

framework aims to protect the interests of

financial consumers and promote fairness

and transparency for consumers of financial

products and services. New initiatives were

taken by the Central Bank in streamlining the

processing of complaints and requests, introducing

suitable legal provisions to facilitate financial

consumer protection framework either through

new legislations or by making amendments to

existing legislations and conducting examinations/

investigations on specific complaints. These

measures will empower authorities to take prompt

actions on financial consumer protection related

issues. The Financial Consumer Relations

Department (FCRD) of the Central Bank received

6,186 complaints and requests during 2021, with

an average of around 500 complaints per month.

Out of the complaints that require action, more

than 91 per cent were attended and approximately

45.7 per cent of the total complaints were settled

succeesfully. It is observed that most of the

complaints were from COVID-19 affected small

and medium scale businesses and individuals with

respect to moratoria, rescheduling of loans, high

interest rates, unacceptable/unethical practices,

and early settlement of credit facilities. In 2021, the

FCRD of the Central Bank introduced a simplified

Complaint Submission Form (CSF), improving the

efficiency of the complaint handling process.

Resolution and Enforcement Action on Weak Financial Institutions

The Central Bank continued to manage Sri

Lanka Deposit Insurance and Liquidity Support

Scheme (SLDILSS). In addition to the regulations

issued to increase the maximum compensation

payable amount from Rs. 600,000 to Rs. 1,100,000,

a new regulation, viz Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance

Liquidity Support Scheme Regulations No. 02 of

2021, was issued repealing and replacing previous

regulations of SLDILSS to improve operations and

management of SLDILSS in line with international

best practices. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic,

the Central Bank ensured the smooth functioning

of compensation payments to insured depositors

of the license cancelled/suspended finance

companies, namely, Central Investments and

Finance PLC (CIFL), The Standard Credit Finance

Ltd. (TSCFL), TKS Finance Ltd. (TKSFL), The

Finance Company PLC (TFC), ETI Finance Ltd

(ETIFL) and Swarnamahal Financial Services

PLC (SFSP) during the corresponding period.

The Central Bank paid compensation through

SLDILSS to 70,832 depositors amounting to

Rs. 29,251.46 million in relation to the above six (06)

companies, as at 31 December 2021 by following

an internally developed payment mechanism and

under the Agency Banking Agreement with the

People’s Bank. The loan outstanding (capital) of

one member institution, given under the liquidity

support facility as at 31 December 2021 was

Rs. 1.4 billion.

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2021

The Central Bank conducted several

investigations on prohibited schemes under

the relevant provisions of the Banking Act

No. 30 of 1988 upon receiving complaints from

the general public. Further, several awareness

programmes were conducted island wide with a view

of improving the financial literacy of different segments

of the general public to educate them on the ill effects

of joining prohibited schemes. The Central Bank is

in the process of formulating a resolution framework

for licenced banks and licenced finance companies

within the existing regulator framework.

Regulation and Supervision of Foreign Exchange

The Central Bank continued to regulate and

supervise foreign exchange transactions during

the year, amidst the challenges faced due to the

pandemic. Several policy measures were introduced

under the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Act

No. 12 of 2017 (FEA) with a view to preserving

foreign currency reserves and improving liquidity in

the domestic foreign exchange market.

A revised set of Regulations, Orders and

Directions were issued under the FEA with

effect from 22 March 2021 replacing the

previously issued Regulations, Orders and

Directions in order to address practical issues

and concerns of Authorised Dealers (ADs)

and other stakeholders, with the purpose of

achieving greater efficiency in the domestic

foreign exchange market. Further, considering

liquidity issues in the domestic foreign exchange

market, certain outward remittances in respect

of capital transactions were limited by an Order

issued by the Minister of Finance under Section 22

of the FEA. Opening of Special Deposit Accounts

(SDAs), which was introduced in the year 2020, was

extended for another one year period from 08 April

2021 considering its positive impact on the country

in terms of the increase in inward remittances.

Moreover, Directions were issued facilitating

resident companies to receive proceeds for equity

in foreign currency from non-resident investors,

while also enabling them to utilise such proceeds for

current transactions, without converting them into

Sri Lanka rupees. Further, in order to attract more

inward remittances, companies incorporated in

Sri Lanka were permitted to purchase ISBs issued

by the Government of Sri Lanka from the secondary

market, out of the externally borrowed funds.

In an effort to attract foreign currency

in the hands of residents into the formal

channels, an Order under Section 4 of the

FEA was issued by the Minister of Finance

permitting hotels registered with the Sri Lanka

Tourism Development Authority to accept

foreign currency from persons resident in

Sri Lanka who have foreign currency in their

possession. Additionally, to improve the liquidity

of the domestic foreign exchange market, Rules

were issued under the Monetary Law Act No. 58

of 1949 (MLA) requiring exporters to repatriate

export proceeds into the country within 180

days and to convert the same into Sri Lanka

rupees. These rules were amended from time

to time as necessary, adjusting the percentage

of export proceeds required to be converted into

Sri Lanka rupees. Accordingly, the amount of export

proceeds repatriated to Sri Lanka and converted

into Sri Lanka Rupees as required by the Rules

showed a gradual improvement throughout the

year, supporting the domestic foreign exchange

market to a certain extent.

Activities of Restricted Dealers (RDs) who

are authorised to engage in money changing

business were continuously monitored to

ensure their compliance with the Rules and

Regulations. The overall performance of RDs

deteriorated during the year given the subdued

economic activities amidst the pandemic.

Additionally, data on export proceeds collected

from ADs on a monthly basis were continuously

monitored to ensure compliance by exporters

and ADs with the Rules issued under the MLA.

Actions were also taken during 2021 to implement

a comprehensive cross border foreign currency

transactions monitoring system to collect data from

ADs in terms of the Regulations and Directions

issued under the FEA, including inflows/ outflows

of the domestic foreign exchange market, whilst

supporting macroeconomic decision making on

foreign exchange operations.

Credit Information

Despite the challenging environment posed

by COVID-19 pandemic, the Credit Information

Bureau (CRIB) continued its operations by

providing 8.37 million credit reports to member

lending institutions during 2021. However,

reports issued recorded a slight decrease of 3.2

percent compared to the previous year. Demand for

the self-inquiry credit reports (iReports) recorded

a 0.6 per cent decline in 2021, compared to the

year 2020. During the year 2021, 8,114 customers

visited the Bureau to obtain their iReports and

1,438 customers applied for their iReports through

banks. CRIB issued 2,988 self-inquiry credit

Implementation of the Road Map for Sustainable Finance in Sri Lanka

The Central Bank joined the Sustainable

Finance Network supported by the International

Finance Corporation (IFC) in 2016, with a view

to promoting sustainable finance practices in Sri

Lanka. Subsequently, with the technical assistance

of the IFC and the financial assistance of the United

Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the

Central Bank launched a ‘Road Map for Sustainable

Finance in Sri Lanka’ in April 2019. This Road Map

provides a broad direction to financial regulators,

financial institutions, and the markets to effectively

manage environmental, social and governance

(ESG) risks associated with projects they finance

and promotes assistance to businesses that are

greener, climate-friendly, and socially inclusive.

In operationalising the actions of the Road

Map, the Central Bank initiated a process

of devising an applicable Green Finance

Taxonomy in 2021, which is a key requirement

in facilitating the financial sector towards

sustainable finance. The said taxonomy will

establish a classification and measurement

system for green activities and provide a common

consensus to financial institutions in determining

green/sustainable projects. The Central Bank

is working closely with the IFC, which provides

technical and financial support in developing the

Green Finance Taxonomy, and expects to launch it

in the first half of 2022.

Accordingly, Rs. 6,469 million was disbursed for the 2016 Yala season and the figure for 2016 is only for the 2015/16 Maha season, while Rs. 10,304 million was disbursed for 2017. Further, Rs. 8,002 million was disbursed for the 2017/18 Maha season. Cash grant system was eliminated w.e.f. the 2018 Yala season. Hence the figure for 2018 is only for the 2018 Yala season.

(b) The exchange rates have been defined in terms of indices so that the appreciation/depreciation of the rupee relative to other currencies is directly reflected by a rise/fall in the values of the effective exchange rates indices, respectively.

(c) The NEER is the weighted average of nominal exchange rates of the 24 trading partner and competitor countries.

Weights are based on the trade shares reflecting the relative importance of each currency in the currency basket.

(d) The REER is computed by adjusting the NEER for inflation differentials (based on CCPI) with the countries whose currencies are included in the basket. The REER Indices for 2020 are provisional.

(Contd.)(a) M2b is based on the aggregated data pertaining to the Central Bank and both Domestic Banking Units (DBUs) and Offshore Banking Units (OBUs) of Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) operating in Sri Lanka. Definitional changes have been adopted in aggregating DBUs and OBUs to avoid double counting and misclassification of assets and liabilities. The major changes are:

(1) All DBU placements with OBUs are recorded as domestic assets, while all DBU borrowings from OBUs are recorded as domestic liabilities.

(2) Foreign currency deposits with DBUs are classified on the basis of ownership rather than on the basis of currency. Hence, the following apply: (i) One half (50 per cent) of Non Resident Foreign Currency (NRFC) deposits are treated as

domestic deposit liabilities

(ii) All Resident Non National Foreign Currency (RNNFC) balances are treated as foreign liabilities

(iii) All other domestic foreign currency accounts are treated as domestic deposit liabilities

(b) External assets (net) of the Central Bank and commercial banks (including outward bills)

(c) Currency and demand deposits held by the public

(d) Time and savings deposits of the public held with commercial banks

(e) This includes NFA of the Central Bank as well as the Government’s Crown Agent’s balance reported by

the Department of State Accounts.

(a) Under Sections 10c, 93, 94, 96 and 97 of the amended Monetary Law Act (Chapter 422), commercial banks and other financial institutions are required to maintain reserves against their deposit liabilities as prescribed by the Monetary Board. Currently, only commercial banks are subject to reserve requirements. With effect from 24 January 1992, an amount of till cash over and above two per cent of the total deposit liabilities, but not exceeding four per cent, could be maintained as a part of required reserves in the form of Sri Lanka currency notes and coins. With the reduction of Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) to 2.00 per cent with effect from 16 June 2020, the Central Bank also reduced till cash adjustment for the SRR compilation to an amount over and above two per cent of the total deposit liabilities, but not exceeding three per cent. Details of required reserve ratios, which were applicable in the past and computation methods have been published in the Appendix table on the ‘Reserve Position of Commercial Banks’ in the Annual Reports prior to 2003. (b) With effect from June 2013, the basis for computing the SRR was changed and 7 day reserve calculation and maintenance periods were increased to two periods per month, first from 1st to 15th and the second from 16th to end of each month. Up to May 2013, Reserve data were for the last reserve week of each

month and from June 2013 onwards, Reserve data are for the second reserve period of each month. The required reserves recorded in the table refer to the cumulative reserves for the reserve period, while commercial banks’ deposits with the Central Bank are the cumulative deposits for that particular period. Excess/Deficit on SRR is the difference between the cumulative SRR for the reserve period and cumulative deposits of the commercial banks for the period.(c) Excludes interbank deposits(d) SRR reduced to 5.00 per cent, 4.00 per cent and 2.00 per cent, with effect from the reserve maintenance periods commencing 01 March 2019, 16 March 2020 and 16 June 2020, respectively. Subsequently, SRR increased to 4.00 per cent, with effect from the reserve maintenance period commencing 01 September 2021.(e) A Margin Deposit Requirement on Letters of Credit / Documents against acceptance terms was imposed with effect from October 2018 to March 2019. The balances of these margin accounts are included in the Total Reserves.

Estimates for the period 1950 - 1958 have been computed using the growth rates in “Estimates of Sri Lanka’s Gross National Product from 1950 - 1981”, T. Savundranayagam, Staff Studies Vol. 12 No.2 September 1982 and Vol. 13 No.1 and 2 April - September, 1983. Therefore, from 1950-1958 the sum of sectoral shares does not add to 100%. National Accounts data from 2002 onwards are based on the estimates of the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS). National Accounts estimates were rebased in 1970, 1982, and 1996 by the Central Bank and in 2002 and 2010 by the DCS. The GDP and GNI estimates before the base year revisions are given below. 1970 (CBSL estimates) : GDP (current factor cost prices) = Rs. 11,705 mn, GNI (current factor cost prices) = Rs. 12,671 mn 1982 (CBSL estimates) : GDP (current factor cost prices) = Rs. 91,943 mn, GNI (current factor cost prices) = Rs. 89,609 mn 1996 (CBSL estimates) : GDP (current factor cost prices) = Rs.695,934 mn, GNI (current factor cost prices) = Rs. 684,676 mn 2002 (CBSL estimates) : GDP (current market prices) = Rs. 1,581,885 mn, GNI (current market prices) = Rs. 1,599,867 mn 2010 (DCS estimates) : GDP (current market prices) = Rs. 5,604,104 mn, GNI (current market prices) = Rs. 5,534,327 mn(b) Estimates are updated with the latest population figures(c) This series has been computed by splicing several series of implicit GDP deflators obtained with different base years. Hence, it would differ from a series compiled using the current and constant values of GDP.(d) Revised(e) Provisional

(a) All values except Money Multiplier and Velocity of Money are in Rs. million(b) M2b is based on the aggregated data pertaining to the Central Bank, and both Domestic Banking Units (DBUs) and Offshore Banking Units (OBUs) of LCBs operating in Sri Lanka. Definitional changes have been adopted in aggregating DBUs and OBUs to avoid double counting and misclassification of assets and liabilities. (c) NDA is equal to the sum of net credit to government (NCG), claims on public corporations/State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs), claims on private sector and other items (net). (d) Demand deposits held by the public (e) Time and savings deposits held by the public (f) This includes NFA of the Central Bank as well as the Government’s Crown Agent’s balance reported by the Department of State Accounts.(g) The Central Bank adopted International Accounting Standards in January 2002. Accordingly, since then foreign assets are recorded at market value, which reflects its impact in NFA and NDA of Monetary Authorities. Therefore, the values for the period prior to January 2002 are not comparable with the values thereafter.(h) Credit extended to the Government by the banking system, net of government deposits with banks and government’s cash balances(i) Monetary data since 1990 were reclassifed to be consistent with standard international practices. Accordingly, rupee deposits held by non-residents are excluded from the total demand, time and savings deposits held by the public. The excluded amount is classified under foreign liabilities.(j) Velocity of money, which is calculated based on annual average M2b, is computed based on year-end M2b only for 1991.(k) Revised
