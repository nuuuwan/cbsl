Money 
Through Hawala Channels
Informal money remitting channels provide a convenient 
platform 
laundering  and 
laundering is simply the conversion of money generated 
from illicit crimes into legally accepted money. The process 
of  money  laundering  involves  the  following  three  steps. 
The first step is the placement where proceeds of the illicit 
crime  are  placed  in  the  financial  channel,  i.e.,  in  bank 
accounts. The second step is layering, which involves a 
series of transactions involved to conceal the origin of the 
proceeds of the illicit crime. The final step is integration 
where proceeds of the illicit crime are absorbed into the 
economy. Terrorist financing is the act of funding terrorist 
activities  and/or  organisations.  The  source  of  financing 
terrorism  can  be  legal  or  illegal.  Continuous  inflows 
to  backup  terrorist  activities  are  a  must  to  continue  the 
agendas of terrorist groups. Hence, different avenues are 
misused by terrorists for their funding needs. 
There  are  several  ways 
support  money  laundering  and  terrorist  financing.  The 
absence  of  a 
identify  any  drawbacks  and  negative  consequences  of 
these  channels  is  one  of  the  key  factors  making  them 
vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing. 
The absence of proper record retention procedures by 
these agents is another supportive factor. Compared to 
the banking sector, the lack of attention to the source and 
use of funds during these transactions also encourage 
money launderers and terrorist financiers. The difficulty 
to initiate legal proceedings is another notable feature. 
Risks of Using Informal Channels 
Many  innocent  people  get  caught  in  law  enforcement 
investigations as a result of their choice to use Hawala 
channels to transfer funds arising from otherwise lawful

communications between members of Hawala dealers. 
Hence, there is no way to prove the transaction and there 
is a high possibility of losing all the hard earned money 
that needs to be transferred. Sometimes Hawala dealers 
are  directly  or  indirectly  involved  in  criminal  activities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
