unprecedented, surpassing the effects of the two world 
wars,  the  great  depression,  and  the  global  financial 
crisis (The World Bank, 2022).
How did Central banks react to COVID-19?
Central  banks  and  monetary  authorities  worldwide 
introduced both conventional and unconventional policy 
responses to address the multifaceted challenges of the 
pandemic.  These  measures 
include  monetary  policy 
relaxations, 
asset 
repurchasing/quantitative 
easing 
programmes,  and  regulatory  forbearances,  as  well  as 
and payment freezes/moratoria (International Monetary 
Fund, 2022).
In  the  wake  of  the  pandemic,  the  Central  Bank  of  Sri 
Lanka (CBSL) also introduced a series of extraordinary 
policy measures to provide liquidity to the economy and 
regulatory forbearances to provide operational flexibility 
to licensed banks and non-banking financial institutions 
(NBFIs), (hereinafter referred to as financial institutions, 
FIs) to assist their customers.
Accordingly, CBSL requested FIs to provide a six-month 
moratorium on capital and interest payments on loans 
obtained  by  borrowers  affected  by  the  pandemic  and 
to  waive  off  any  accrued  and  unpaid  penal  interest 
charged  on  such  loans.  Considering  the  subsequent 
waves of the pandemic, this was extended for more than 
18 months for customers who were severely affected.
Additionally,  CBSL  also

customers,  reduced  interest  rates  on  targeted  lending 
products,  provided  liquidity  facility  to  the  construction 
sector  and  other  government 
recovery  actions  against  non-performing 
reduced fees and charges on several banking services 
to provide relief to retail customers.
