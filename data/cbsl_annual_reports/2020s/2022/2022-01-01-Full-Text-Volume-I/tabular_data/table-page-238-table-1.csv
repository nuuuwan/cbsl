"Current Status of SOEs in Sri Lanka
Proposed Major SOE Reforms
a. Introduction of Cost Reflective Pricing Policies
Over  the  last  three  decades,  successive  governments 
have alternated between attempts at privatisation and 
Often SOEs have to strike a fine balance between helping 
nationalisation.  Currently,  there  are  over  400  SOEs 
the  Government  achieve  its  socioeconomic  objectives 
operating 
in 
several  key 
sectors 
including  power, 
while  ensuring  the  enterprise’s  financial  viability.  This 
energy, finance and insurance, water, aviation, health 
challenge  stems  from  the  engagement  of  SOEs  in  the 
and education, among others. While a large majority 
of SOEs are regulated by the ‘Administer Part II’ of the 
Finance Act No. 38 of 1971, of recent times, several 
have been established under the Companies Act No. 
07 of 2007. Of these, 52 SOEs have been identified 
as State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs) as they 
are 
regarded 
to  be

their  pivotal 
strategic  sectors,  the  poor  financial  performance  of 
SOEs has become a heavy fiscal burden with significant 
macroeconomic implications. The excessive reliance of 
SOEs  on  the  banking  system  to  fund  their  losses  has 
not  only  crowded  out  productive  investments  but  has 
also rendered the financial system vulnerable to their 
weak financial performance. Macroeconomic stability 
is also threatened as their burgeoning financial losses 
weigh down on their ability to smoothly fulfill domestic
