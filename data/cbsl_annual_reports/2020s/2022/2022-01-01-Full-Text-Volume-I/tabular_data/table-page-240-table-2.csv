"The  composition  of  Boards  plays  a  crucial  role  in  the 
quality  of  corporate  governance. 
It 
is  vital 
that 
the 
Government  promotes  the  appointment  of  competent, 
experienced  and  professional  individuals  to  Boards  to 
ensure  strong  accountability.  Appointments  should  be 
on the basis of fixed term contracts that are independent 
of election cycles. This can ensure efficacious strategic 
planning  suited  for  transformation  over  the  medium 
term rather than the implementation of transient fixes. 
It 
is 
also 
management  of  SOEs  act  diligently  and  with  extreme 
care  considering  that  the  resources  entrusted  to  them 
are ultimately the resources of the general public. The 
recent issuance of Guidelines on Corporate Governance 
and an Operational Manual for State Owned Enterprises 
in  late  2021  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  is  a  timely 
initiative in this regard. Rigorous monitoring on the part 
of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  to  ensure  that  all  SOEs  are 
operating in line with these guidelines can catalyse the 
transformation process of these entities. Regular reviews 
of  the  guidelines  are  also  necessary  to  continuously 
align SOE corporate governance standards in line with 
best international practices. 
Good  corporate  governance  helps  to  operate  SOEs 
more efficiently, improve access to capital, and mitigate 
risk 
while 
Research  findings  reveal  several  direct  advantages  for 
SOEs  that  have  undergone  governance  reforms.  Such 
benefits 
include 
increased  access 
through  domestic  and 
financing for infrastructure development, reduced fiscal 
burden  of  SOEs  and  increased  net  contribution  to  the 
budget through higher dividend payments, and reduced 
corruption and improved transparency.
Reforms in SOEs: International Experiences
Countries across the world have made attempts across 
several decades to turnaround the performance of their 
SOEs.  Selected  SOE  reform  experiences,  as  could  be 
pertinent to Sri Lanka, are described below.
Singapore
In the case of Singapore, the investment holding company 
Temasek has seen much success. It was established in 
1974  to  own  and  commercially  manage  investments 
and  assets  previously  held  by 
Singapore. Following independence in 1965, the lack of 
raw natural resources drove Singapore to commence an
