Initiatives  were 
taken 
to  encourage 
workers’ remittances through formal channels including 
the provision of incentives above the normal exchange 
rate  for  the  foreign  exchange  remittances  converted 
at licensed banks, reimbursement of transaction costs 
incurred on account of workers’ remittances, and the 
launch  of  a  National  Remittance  Mobile  Application 
branded as “Lanka Remit”. Further, rules were issued 
requiring  hotel  service  providers  registered  with  the

services 
rendered 
residents  only  in  foreign  exchange.    Moreover,  the 
Central  Bank  has  also  been  able  to  secure  foreign 
financial assistance from regional central banks by way 
of  bilateral  currency  swaps.  Although  the  short  term 
policy  measures  have  been  effective  in  reviving  the 
external  sector  to  a  certain  extent,  policies  spanning 
over  medium  to  long  term  are  required  to  enhance 
the resilience and maintain continuous stability in the 
external sector. Such policies should be focused on the 
following key areas:
