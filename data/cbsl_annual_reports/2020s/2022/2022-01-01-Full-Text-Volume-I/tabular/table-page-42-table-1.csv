"","depreciation of the exchange rate on the society. However, the outcome of the exchange rate flexibility that"

"","Price  stability,  which  was  the  strongest  pillar  for  macroeconomic  stability  over  the  last  decade  or  so,"
"","was  challenged  since  the  second  half  of  2021  due  to  the  combined  impact  of  global  and  local  supply"
"","driven causes as well as the build-up of excessive demand pressures on prices, primarily caused by the"
"","lagged impact of extraordinary monetary accommodation, including unprecedented monetary financing that"
"","became required due to the lack of fiscal space. Moreover, the external sector remained on the brink of a"
"","precarious state since late 2021 due to the mounting Balance of Payments (BOP) pressures reflected in"
"","the meagre level of official reserves amidst significant debt servicing obligations along with the dire need"
"","to finance essential imports at a time when the domestic foreign exchange market remained largely illiquid."
"","Calamities in the power and energy sector, acute shortages of essentials and raw materials and the spillover"
"","effects  of  these  on  every  nook  and  cranny  of  the  economy  could  disrupt  economic  activity  excessively"
"","unless resolved urgently. The actions and policy measures taken on a piecemeal basis to fix or postpone"
"","these severe conditions have proven to be unsuccessful or created novel issues. Any notable intervention"
"","by fiscal authorities to ease these domestic economic conditions to restore normalcy remained a remote"
"","possibility due to historically high public debt levels, further weakening of fiscal balances and extremely low"
"","sovereign rating. As a result, the Central Bank took swift measures in early April 2022 to preempt further"
"","deterioration  of  macroeconomic  stability  and  to  restore  price  stability  through  a  significant  tightening  of"
"","monetary policy, among others. These policy initiatives would be imperative to commence bold structural"
"","reforms to revitalise medium to long term macroeconomic stability, which remains a necessary condition for"
"","long term inclusive growth."
"","In this regard, the implementation of several structural reforms is vital at this juncture by the Government"
"","to complement the Central Bankâ€™s remedial policies. Implementing strong fiscal adjustments, which have"
"","been long delayed and often reversed in the past, will lead to a visible turnaround in the current complex"
"","economic turmoil. Sustainable containment of the budget deficit through an upward level shift to government"
"","revenue along with the rationalisation and prioritisation of government expenditure would help contain the"
"","expansion  of  government  borrowing  going  forward.  Further,  a  comprehensive  and  coherent  approach"
"","to  achieving  and  maintaining  public  debt  sustainability  is  a  must  to  take  any  step  forward  in  addressing"
"","the  current  economic  problem.  These  essential  fiscal  adjustments  have  to  be  supported  by  financially"
"","independent and autonomous State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs) by introducing, among others,"
"","cost  reflective  pricing  structures,  institutionalisation  of  good  governance  and  accountability  mechanisms,"
"","notable productivity enhancement and service delivery in the overall public sector, and strengthening of well"
"","targeted social safety net schemes. While it is necessary to strengthen legal frameworks to ensure public"
"","accountability of state institutions, exercising existing legal powers in policy formulation and implementation"
"","by relevant authorities would ensure lasting economic welfare in the country. These changes would ensure"
"","increased participation of the private sector with ease, while the public sector continues to play a facilitator"
