In this context, long term stability in the external sector, characterised by a sustainable external debt position and a manageable external current account deficit, has been identified as an important near to medium term priority in macroeconomic policymaking.

The development strategy of the Government was based on encouraging import substitution and domestic agricultural expansion to reduce import expenditure and achieve self sufficiency in essential commodities. By the mid 1960s, the economy was heavily regulated with protectionist measures and an overvalued fixed exchange rate was maintained.

As an integral part of the liberal policy regime, the dual exchange rate system was abolished by establishing a unified exchange rate. The transition from a fixed exchange rate regime to a managed float exchange rate regime, which determined the exchange rate based on market demand and supply conditions, was a radical shift in Sri Lanka\u2019s exchange rate policy. A plethora of exchange control relaxation measures were also implemented. These policy measures included removal of restrictions on current transactions, lifting of quantitative import restrictions, rationalisation and simplification of import tariff structure, and removal of price controls and licensing requirements. Simultaneously, in view of reducing the adverse implications stemming from fiscal sector imbalances, many fiscal reforms, such as restructuring of food subsidies, privatising government enterprises and promoting private sector led growth, were introduced. Incentives were provided to encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) to export industries and export processing zones. Foreign financial flows gradually started to increase after 1977, with the relaxation of exchange restrictions. Subsequently, with the economy",

Trade openness, which is the total value of exports and imports in relation to the country\u2019s GDP, was 36.4 per cent in 1977 and it nearly doubled to 72.2 per cent by 1979. However, Sri Lanka\u2019s international trade performance has not been impressive in terms of trade openness, declining to levels that were seen during the pre-liberalisation era by 2019, where Sri Lanka's trade openness was 38.0 per cent.

When comparing the external debt as a percentage of GDP with its regional peers, Sri Lanka has recorded the highest ratio after Bhutan, Maldives and Cambodia.

Total external debt service payments as a percentage of export of goods and services has increased from 13.2 per cent in 2011 to 30.0 per cent in 2021 indicating that nearly one third of Sri Lanka\u2019s annual export earnings are consumed for debt servicing.

While the exchange rate was maintained at around Rs. 200 \u2013 203 per US dollar during most of 2021 and until early March 2022, mainly through moral suasion by the Central Bank, a notable development of parallel markets for foreign exchange was observed. However, following the adjustment in the exchange rate in early March 2022 and subsequent market pressure, the Sri Lanka rupee depreciated sharply by 33.0 per cent against the US dollar by end March 2022. However, some stability in the exchange rate is expected with the significant tightening of the monetary policy stance in early April 2022 along with other corrective measures currently being considered to be implemented with immediate effect, which mainly include, initiating discussions with the IMF for an economic adjustment programme, suspension of external debt servicing for an interim period leading to an orderly and consensual debt restructuring process, and fiscal consolidation, along with the negotiations to obtain bridging financing.",

Further, rules were issued requiring hotel service providers registered with the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority to accept payments in respect of services rendered to non residents only in foreign exchange. Moreover, the Central Bank has also been able to secure foreign financial assistance from regional central banks by way of bilateral currency swaps. Although the short term policy measures have been effective in reviving the external sector to a certain extent, policies spanning over medium to long term are required to enhance the resilience and maintain continuous stability in the external sector. Such policies should be focused on the following key areas:",

Such debt management process may involve a comprehensive debt restructuring plan, which would be conditional upon an agreement to an economic reform programme with the IMF. In parallel, the Government announced on 12 April 2022 that it would temporarily suspend external debt servicing for an interim period pending consensual external debt restructuring.

Hence, increasing the country\u2019s gross official reserves remain the most important medium term objective of the external sector. The country envisages to enhance gross official reserves to cover a minimum of 4 months of merchandise imports. While these targets remain significantly challenging, the ongoing efforts towards debt restructuring and envisaged foreign currency inflows are expected to increase gradually over the medium to long term, enabling the gradual build-up of gross official reserves. While the medium term objective of the Central Bank is to gradually increase the quantity of reserves, the composition is also expected to be improved by organic build-up of reserves through non-borrowed sources.",

The existing NES was designed and implemented with a view to transforming Sri Lanka into an export hub driven by innovation and was expected to be implemented within a 5-year horizon from 2018 - 2022. It will be important to revive the NES with some modifications to suit the more recent developments in international trade and provide much needed policy support to the exports sector and such policies should continue without interruption under any political regime. Implementation of a broad based and consistent NES is expected to create steady and sustainable growth in exports while unlocking potential export sectors to create new job opportunities and facilitating value addition through increased participation in global value chains and product sharing networks. Along with these, measures should be introduced and monitored in attracting investment to the tradable sector, especially for industries producing intermediate goods for the export sector and industries oriented mainly towards global trade.",

It is imperative that the long neglected structural reforms are introduced in the immediate future to reduce the external current account deficit and the fiscal deficit, which remained the root cause of the recurring external sector instability for decades. Managing the twin deficits at sustainable levels is crucial to ensure long term sustainability in country\u2019s external debt, while maintaining healthy levels of reserves to withstand economic headwinds, thereby ensuring long term stability of the external sector.",

Further, narrowing of the gap between the official exchange rate and the grey market rate is also expected to help attract higher foreign remittances formally. Active stakeholder engagement to promote foreign employment, diversifying foreign employment market and upskilling of migrant employees are expected to secure more foreign employment opportunities with higher earnings, thereby increasing the contribution of workers\u2019 remittances to cushion the impact of the widening trade deficit.",
