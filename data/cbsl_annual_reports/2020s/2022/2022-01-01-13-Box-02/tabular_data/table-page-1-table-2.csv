"Partial Liberalisation of the Economy from Late 1960s 
Introduction
to 1970
In  an  open  economy,  stability  in  the  external  sector  is 
vital  as  external  imbalances  could  cause  widespread 
Partial liberalisation of international trade was allowed 
spillover  effects  across  all  sectors  of 
the  economy, 
thereby 
threatening 
the 
overall 
macroeconomic 
stability.  The  external  sector 
in  Sri  Lanka  has  been 
cent in 1967 and the introduction of the dual exchange 
facing 
amidst headwinds caused by the COVID-19 pandemic 
and  adverse  developments  in  the  global  economy.  In 
this  context,  long  term  stability  in  the  external  sector, 
characterised  by  a  sustainable  external  debt  position 
and a manageable external current account deficit, has 
been  identified  as  an  important  near  to  medium  term 
priority 
in  macroeconomic  policymaking.  Sri  Lanka 
needs sustainable solutions to ensure long term stability 
in the external sector vis-a-vis short term measures. 
Evolution of External Sector Related Economic 
Policies in Sri Lanka
At  the  time  of  gaining  independence  from  the  British, 
Sri  Lanka  was  an  agriculture  based  open  economy 
characterised by a plantation sector and a subsistence 
agriculture  sector  with  a  fixed  exchange  rate  regime. 
Exports were based on three main plantation crops; tea, 
rubber  and  coconut,  which  accounted  for  around  90 
per cent of total exports. 
External Sector Policies in the Post-Independence Era
Free Trade Policy in Early 1950s
Sri  Lanka  maintained  a  free  trade  policy  regime  in  the 
early period of independence and the country was one 
of the most liberalised economies in Asia. Until the late 
1950s,  Sri  Lanka  was  able  to  sustain  the  open  trade 
policy regime with large trade surpluses supported by two 
commodity booms, which had led to significant build-up 
of  foreign  reserves.  However,  substantial  trade  deficits 
were recorded since 1957 owing to the rapid growth of 
import expenditure and deterioration of terms of trade.
Import Controls from Mid 1950s to Mid 1960s 
Large trade deficits exerted pressure on the balance of 
payments (BOP) resulting in a sharp depletion of gross 
official reserves after 1956. In response, by establishing 
a Foreign Exchange Budget Committee, the Government 
imposed  rigorous  import  control  measures  including 
imposition  of  quotas,  licenses  and  tariffs  on  imports 
except  food,  petroleum  and  pharmaceutical  imports. 
The  development 
strategy  of 
based on encouraging import substitution and domestic 
agricultural  expansion 
to 
reduce 
and  achieve  self  sufficiency  in  essential  commodities. 
By the mid 1960s, the economy was heavily regulated 
with  protectionist  measures  and  an  overvalued  fixed 
exchange 
rate  was  maintained.  Meanwhile,  export","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
