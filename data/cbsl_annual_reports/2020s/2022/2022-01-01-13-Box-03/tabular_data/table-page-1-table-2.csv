The outbreak of the pandemic and related uncertainties 
have severely affected Sri Lanka, prominently the fiscal 
sector, as reported in many other lower middle-income 
and market access countries. Despite insufficient fiscal

intervention, 
the  Sri 
Lankan  Government  also  committed 
to  providing  a 
number  of  fiscal  stimuli  to  address  pressing  priorities 
since the onset of the pandemic. With increased expenses 
for healthcare and pandemic control measures as well 
as financial and in-kind transfers to vulnerable groups, 
the  Government  spent  at  least  Rs.  117.5  billion  and  
Rs. 165.6 billion as pandemic related expenses for 2020 
and 2021, respectively. The Government instituted a low 
tax regime to boost the sluggish economic activity since 
the latter part of 2019 and this low tax environment was 
upheld during the pandemic period. Several tax reliefs 
for certain essential imports such as medicines were also 
granted  during  this  period.  Consequently,  government 
revenue  dwindled  sharply  during  the  pandemic  period 
owing  to  modest  tax  rates,  and  diminished  tax  base 
due  to  the  increases  in  tax  free  thresholds  as  well  as 
subpar  economic  growth.  Accordingly, 
in  2020  and  2021  increased  to  11.1  per  cent  and  
12.2  per  cent  of  the  GDP,  respectively.  Meanwhile, 
as  per  the  Fiscal  Monitor  Database  of  Fiscal  Policy 
Responses to COVID-19 Pandemic â€“ October 2021, the 
cumulative value of additional spending and foregone 
revenue by the Sri Lankan Government in relation to the
