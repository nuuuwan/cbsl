    "text": "Fiscal policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic curbed the scarring effects on economies across the world facilitating post pandemic recovery, albeit with a notable bearing on public finances, and in turn resulting in fiscal stress in these countries. The swift fiscal measures deployed in response to the unanticipated and unprecedented economic headwinds were disparate in scale, type, and coverage and were dependent on the specific structural, inherent and fiscal leeway of each economy. Advance markets and large emerging markets were in relatively better positions with ample fiscal space to accommodate such fiscal stimuli, compared to small emerging markets and developing economies. Direct budgetary measures such as increased spending on health, provision of unemployment benefits and other reliefs, tax concessions and tax deferments, liquidity support, equity injections, and indirect actions including provision of guarantees for deferred debt repayments were among common fiscal policy measures implemented by numerous countries. The steady stream of fiscal stimuli via deficit spending, and lingering effects of the pandemic together with the slowdown in economic growth have put pressure on fiscal operations of most economies, thereby threatening macroeconomic stability in respective countries.",

    "text": "The outbreak of the pandemic and related uncertainties have severely affected Sri Lanka, prominently the fiscal sector, as reported in many other lower middle-income and market access countries. Despite insufficient fiscal space to undertake hefty fiscal intervention, the Sri Lankan Government also committed to providing a number of fiscal stimuli to address pressing priorities since the onset of the pandemic. With increased expenses for healthcare and pandemic control measures as well as financial and in-kind transfers to vulnerable groups, the Government spent at least Rs. 117.5 billion and Rs. 165.6 billion as pandemic related expenses for 2020 and 2021, respectively. The Government instituted a low tax regime to boost the sluggish economic activity since the latter part of 2019 and this low tax environment was upheld during the pandemic period. Several tax reliefs for certain essential imports such as medicines were also granted during this period. Consequently, government revenue dwindled sharply during the pandemic period owing to modest tax rates, and diminished tax base due to the increases in tax free thresholds as well as subpar economic growth. Accordingly, fiscal deficit in 2020 and 2021 increased to 11.1 per cent and 12.2 per cent of the GDP, respectively. Meanwhile, as per the Fiscal Monitor Database of Fiscal Policy Responses to COVID-19 Pandemic \u2013 October 2021, the cumulative value of additional spending and foregone revenue by the Sri Lankan Government in relation to the pandemic was around 1.1 per cent of the GDP, which",

In addition, with limited fiscal space to manoeuvre, pandemic affected individuals and businesses in Sri Lanka were mainly supported by accommodative monetary policy. Moreover, reduced foreign inflows amidst the pandemic and substantial debt service payments added further stress on the fiscal and external sectors. With limited avenues for new foreign financing sources, liquidity constraints in the international capital markets as well as sovereign rating downgrades of Sri Lanka, the Government was compelled to resort to higher domestic borrowings, especially through the Central Bank and the banking sector, to meet the government financing gaps. Such fiscal imbalances led to the government debt reaching 100.6 per cent and 104.6 per cent of GDP by end 2020 and end 2021, respectively.",

For several decades, Sri Lanka has been plagued by persistent fiscal deficits, compelling the Government to continually borrow from both domestic and foreign markets and accumulate public debt. As a result, a large fraction of government revenue and foreign currency inflows to the country are required to be channelled for debt service payments, permitting little leeway for productive investments. Since 1994, revenue and grants have not been sufficient to meet at least recurrent expenditure of the Government, necessitating government borrowings to cover recurrent expenses that generally do not contribute to future growth and",

Blanchard (2004) also asserts that inflation targeting only through monetary policy may not be successful in a high debt environment. The monetary authority\u2019s attempt to raise the real interest rate with the aim of maintaining inflation at a targeted rate may aggravate debt levels through increased borrowing costs, if the fiscal authority is disinclined for fiscal consolidation. Moreover, rising debt levels could intensify sovereign default risk and exert exchange rate depreciation pressure, and thereby result in higher inflation instead of lower inflation. Therefore, Blanchard (2004) emphasises that in a high debt environment, inflation should be managed through fiscal policy by attempting to reduce fiscal deficits, and thereby government debt levels, instead of only using monetary policy to combat inflation. Meanwhile, some academics have argued that inflation and financial repression1",

Therefore, at this critical juncture, the objective of attaining macroeconomic stability by resolving the macroeconomic imbalances supersedes the objective of achieving near term higher growth. Contrary to the traditional Keynesian view, recent studies have also indicated the possibility of offsetting contractionary effects of fiscal consolidation, when the fiscal consolidation is large and perceived to be credible by the public, especially when public debt levels are high (Giavazzi & Pagano, 1990). On one hand, private consumption could increase if households perceive there is a permanent reduction in the government borrowing requirement when the Government is committed to achieving fiscal consolidation. Such a reduction in government borrowings implies lower taxes in future and thus, a higher lifetime income for the households, encouraging them to increase their consumption from the current period. On the other hand, a reduction in government borrowing requirements will reduce inflation risk premia and default risk premia associated with public debt issuances due to lower inflation expectations and fewer economic uncertainties. This will lead to a fall in real interest rates and promote more productive private investment. As such, given the serious macroeconomic imbalances emanating from weak fiscal conditions, well-planned fiscal consolidation measures are more likely to be beneficial for the Sri Lankan economy, particularly to ensure macroeconomic stability and growth in the medium to long term. However, it is crucial that Sri Lanka implements the optimal combination of consolidation strategies to minimise possible contractionary effects in the short term and thereby avert fiscal austerity being a \u2018self-defeating\u2019 strategy.",

Accordingly, as a result of attempts for fiscal consolidation, a country\u2019s fiscal performance may even deteriorate further due to lower revenue collection and lower nominal GDP following the slowdown in economic growth. Hence, as the economic growth of the country has already been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, fiscal consolidation during the pandemic period itself may be a greater concern for policymakers.

However, given the low tax revenue to GDP ratio, Sri Lanka still has space for manoeuvring fiscal consolidation through revenue policies with minimal disruptions on output. Successful revenue based fiscal consolidation measures in other countries, such as in Brazil, Canada, Finland, New Zealand, and South Africa, have focused on broadening the tax base and introducing reforms to simplify tax administration (Okwuokei, 2014). Since raising indirect tax rates such as Value Added Tax (VAT) could disproportionately affect consumption of low income households during these hard times, widening the VAT base (increasing the number of VAT paying businesses) would be the appropriate option to augment government revenue while minimising output and distributional effects. In this regard, the VAT free threshold could be revised downwards to the levels that prevailed prior to the last VAT threshold adjustment.3 Meanwhile, considering the modest impact on economic growth, taxes on capital income could be raised at the personal level.",

    "text": "Past experiences of other countries suggest that fiscal austerity through expenditure reduction is more successful since expenditure cuts reflect greater commitment of the Government and efficiency gains (Price, 2010). Although a reduction in wages and transfers are proven to be more effective in fiscal consolidation in other countries, such a move will not be an easy feat in the Sri Lankan context given the associated political cost and stringent labour market conditions. Hence, at least, new government recruitments and major public wage revisions should be considered with caution along with better targeting of subsidies. On the other hand, the reduction in capital expenditure and expenditure on health and education could create more contractionary effects both in the short and long term, especially due to the country\u2019s deficiencies in physical and soft infrastructure. Therefore, fiscal consolidation through sizeable capital expenditure cuts should be achieved through \u2018value for money\u2019 strategies, instead of across the board expense cuts. In this regard, the Central Government as well as local government authorities should streamline capital expenditure by selecting infrastructure projects that generate the highest economic value and future growth potential. Moreover, streamlining and digitalising",

Since the debt burden of inefficient, loss-making State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs) translates into contingent liabilities of the Government, reforms related to SOBEs should be expeditiously implemented in tandem with fiscal austerity. Cost-reflective pricing mechanisms, institutional restructuring for efficiency gains, and market-oriented product and service delivery are several overdue reforms related to SOBEs. In addition, legislative and administrative reforms are required to monitor the progress of fiscal consolidation, strengthen public scrutiny over the consolidation process, and ensure accountability of the policymakers and government officials for meeting austerity targets. It may be noted that the continuous reliance of major SOBEs on the two state banks, and eventually on central bank financing, has created numerous challenges to price stability. Hence, SOBEs should be held accountable for their operations and such entities should not pass their debt burden on commercial banks and the Central Bank.",
