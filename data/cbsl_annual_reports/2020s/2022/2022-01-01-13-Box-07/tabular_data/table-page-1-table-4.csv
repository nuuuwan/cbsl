especially 
in  developing  countries.  This 
is  primarily 
because SOEs continue to be the providers of essential 
infrastructure and public services which have the highest 
impact on economic growth, development and overall 
wellbeing  of  the  population.  However,  SOEs  in  the 
developing world generally tend to be straddled by low 
productivity,  while  distorting  competition  and  being 
afflicted by corruption. This has resulted in them being 
a significant burden on the budget and the government, 
and  in  some  cases  leading  to  fiscal  and  economic 
crises. It is essential that Sri Lanka remains wary of the 
performance of its own SOEs in this context. 
Evolution of SOEs in Sri Lanka
The  development  of  public  sector  enterprises 
Lanka dates back to the Second World War period of 
1939 – 1945, when several SOEs were set up to provide 
essential goods whose supply had been curtailed during 
the  war.  In  the  mid  1950s,  the  interest  in  socialism 
piqued with the successes in the Soviet Union and the 
adoption of a socialist ideology of development in India 
during the same time. Accordingly, the Government of 
the time considered central planning as essential for the 
development of the country. 
During  this  period,  two  key  enactments  catalysed  the 
development  process  of  SOEs,  i.e.  the  Government 
Sponsored  Corporations  Act  No.  19  of  1955  and  the 
State 
Industrial  Corporations  Act  No.  49  of  1957, 
respectively.  The  former  sought  to  incorporate  existing 
industrial undertakings, while the latter empowered the 
Government to set up and carry out any industrial activity. 
By  1957,  several 
operations, 
including 
those 
paper,  ceramics,  leather  and  footwear.  Another  key 
development during this period was the nationalisation 
of bus companies leading to the formation of the Ceylon 
Transport Board in 1958.
1 There  is  no  commonly  accepted  definition  for  an  SOE  (European  Commission,  2013; 
IMF 2014; OECD 2015). However, some characteristics of SOEs are as follows: (1) the 
entity has its own, separate legal personality; (2) the entity is at least partially controlled by 
a government unit; and (3) the entity engages predominantly in commercial or economic 
activities  (IMF,  2020).  The  Government  Financial  Statistics  Manual  2014  (IMF,  2014) 
states that assessing government control of any entity involves judgment. Accordingly, a 
government may exercise significant influence over corporate decisions even when it owns 
a small number of shares.","","","","long,  State  Owned  Enterprises
