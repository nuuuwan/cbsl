The creation of SOEs was expected to be beneficial as it was premised that, as natural monopolies, they would supply services or products at costs which were below than what potential private players could offer and that they would also be able to meet the demand of the entire market, perhaps also with export potential. Accordingly, in subsequent years, there was nationalisation of privately owned business undertakings such as those engaged in port services, passenger transport and plantations, among others. By the mid 1970s, major economic and social activities such as banking, plantations, large scale industries, transport, insurance, telecommunications, postal services, ports, electricity, import and distribution of petroleum, roads, health and education were either public sector monopolies or were largely undertaken by public enterprises. The numbers of SOEs rose rapidly from 14 in 1962 to over 280 public enterprises by the mid 1980s.",

These included operational inefficiencies translating into poor financial performance, subpar quality of products and services and supply shortages, recruitments driven by political considerations rather than the needs of the SOEs, inability to mobilise resources to meet large investment requirements, and, excessive dependence on the government budget. The growing burden of SOEs on the budget alongside multilateral donor agencies highlighting the urgent need for macroeconomic stabilisation led to the Government announcing privatisation as a state policy in 1988. The divestiture programme commenced in 1989 and, over the period till 1993, partial or full divestitures of about 43 commercial enterprises were undertaken. However, this divestiture programme came under much criticism in the period thereafter. Many of Sri Lanka\u2019s experiences with privatisation highlight that the weaker the economy and governing institutions, the more arduous it is to reap the benefits of privatisation.",

Macroeconomic stability is also threatened as their burgeoning financial losses weigh down on their ability to smoothly fulfill domestic demand for essential goods and services. Recognising the issue, in recent years, the Government undertook several initiatives to reform SOEs. Key reforms in this regard are the introduction of a Statement of Corporate Intent (SCI) as a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding signed by the respective enterprise, line Ministry and Ministry of Finance and the introduction of a regulatory framework for SOEs that provides commercial freedom, while increasing their level of accountability. Policy reforms have also been identified to amalgamate or consolidate SOEs with similar objectives and those at similar stages of the value chain thereby creating \u2018economies of scale\u2019 for these enterprises. Further, the Government also recently formed Selendiva Investments Ltd, a fully state owned company, to manage and consolidate several high end real estate assets in a bid to capitalise on the success of \u2018holding company\u2019 models, as seen in Singapore and Malaysia.",

Despite a brief episode of frequent price adjustments of fuel products in line with global developments, no price revisions were undertaken between September 2019 and June 2021, after which three rounds of upward price revisions were undertaken to compensate for both the rising global prices of crude oil and the financial losses incurred by the CPC over several years. Tariffs for water and electricity continue to remain unrevised since 2012 and 2014, respectively. It must be reiterated that, in the case of enterprises such as the CPC and the CEB that rely on imported intermediate goods, their exposure to changes in global commodity prices as well as exchange rate fluctuations warrants regular price revisions. Hence, long periods of unchanged prices or tariffs are unacceptable as evidently losses on account of these external shocks cannot be absorbed by the relevant enterprises.",

Subsidised prices cause price distortions and misallocation of resources that entail significant macroeconomic costs which could translate into insurmountable disruptions in the economy, as depicted by the power and energy crisis that emerged in early 2022. A cost reflective pricing mechanism will also ensure that SOEs pass on benefits of lower costs to consumers in a transparent and timely manner without negative implications on bottom line profits.

Following independence in 1965, the lack of raw natural resources drove Singapore to commence an aggressive industrialisation and economic development programme. As the Government established startups in several strategic sectors, Temasek was established to relieve relevant ministries from the commercial management of these enterprises in which the Government had a controlling stake. With time, the fund encouraged portfolio companies to expand into other markets as well as to pursue mergers and acquisitions to become more internationally competitive. Revisions to the charter over several rounds led Temasek to evolve into a global investment company with the mission of generating sustainable returns beyond the present",

Reforms relating to the implementation of a transparent pricing mechanism, improvement of strategic direction and enhancement of financial accountability are also imperative to improve the performance of SOEs in the short term. These not only ensure improved government revenue but also reduces the need for loss financing through budget transfers or as borrowings from the banking system. This can help release substantial volumes of resources to be channeled to more productive income generation or asset creation by households and enterprises. Accordingly, there will be a multiplier effect on government revenue in the short run and on growth in the medium to long run.",

    "text": "With due consideration to the key role that SOEs play in the economic development process, especially with their wide presence in strategic sectors, it is crucial that these enterprises perform effectively and deliver favourable socioeconomic outcomes without financially burdening the state. In this regard, the Government must conduct individual feasibility studies of SOEs and initiate timely action regarding the sale of some of their assets to domestic or foreign entities. Subsequently, the Government may also consider restrategizing these SOEs without politicizing them to ensure sustainable and viable operations. The Government must also recognise that although such reforms may require some unpopular policy initiatives at the outset, these can pave way for the creation of SOEs that are financially viable and economically beneficial over the medium to long run. The transformation of existing SOEs from \u2018fiscal burdens\u2019 and into \u2018value creators,\u2019 through such reforms, is vital for them to emerge as facilitators of Sri Lanka\u2019s progress onto a high growth trajectory, rather than serve as stumbling blocks.",
