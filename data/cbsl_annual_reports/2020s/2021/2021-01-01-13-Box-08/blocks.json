    "text": "The COVID-19 outbreak, an unprecedented global health crisis that emerged in late 2019 has led to many adverse social and economic implications necessitating countries to introduce new strategies and economic measures to overcome the ensuing adverse situation. The lockdown measures implemented owing to the COVID-19 outbreak have restricted cross border movement of people and goods resulting in disruption to economic and trade activities worldwide. Further, reduced investment, i.e., foreign direct investment, and remittances have adversely impacted emerging economies. Therefore, the sharp decline in global GDP amidst the COVID-19 outbreak may result in a slower economic recovery than expected, since the virus is still prevalent with multiple outbreaks and spikes in infections still being reported worldwide. Hence, given the uncertainty and prolonged nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, individuals and business entities including banks need to adapt and transform their business operations to suit the \u2018new normal\u2019.",

Therefore, alternative methods have been adopted to address these limitations such as more intensified off-site supervision and monitoring of banks. Accordingly, banks are required to report more granular data at a higher frequency with existing data templates/formats being updated and specific reporting formats being developed on an ad-hoc basis as and when required, to support the enhanced off-site supervisory monitoring requirements. Further, regulators have also taken measures to continuously reassess supervisory priorities based on risks emanating from the COVID-19 outbreak such as asset quality, capital adequacy, liquidity profiles, and operational resilience of banks. This is to confirm the adequacy of safeguards and buffers to ensure the resilience of banks. In this regard, stress testing is being carried out by supervisory authorities to assess the post COVID-19 impact on banks against a range of possible scenarios to assess credit exposures, liquidity positions, capital, and solvency of individual banks as well as the banking sector. Further, regulators have also required banks to review and strengthen their recovery plans which are essential tools for crisis management in order to identify recovery options that could be quickly implemented, if required.",

Consequently, regulatory authorities would also need to continuously adapt and monitor early warning frameworks of banks to identify and remedy banks\u2019 critical deficiencies and gauge whether supervisory action towards specific banks is warranted on the basis of risk assessments. The Central Bank will also continue to closely monitor the liquidity and capital positions of licensed banks and any early warnings of stress to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking sector. Further, the Central Bank may also consider implementing additional extraordinary regulatory measures to address any potential challenges to the banking sector, if required. Therefore, supervisory flexibility to quickly respond to such changes is essential in the \u2018new normal\u2019 amidst the COVID-19 outbreak. Hence, supervisory authorities including the Central Bank would need to improve and extend the use of technology, viz. Suptech via Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning and data analytics, etc. Adoption of Suptech could help improve oversight, surveillance and analytical capabilities of supervisory authorities, and help generate real time risk indicator dashboards to support more forward looking, risk based supervisory approaches and practices going forward in the \u2018new normal\u2019 amidst the COVID-19 outbreak.",
