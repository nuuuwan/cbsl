(vii)The operational details of the Scheme are as set out in sections 2 to 6 of this Circular.

2.Performing Loans(i)Eligible borrowers with aggregate outstanding fund based exposure of up to Rs. 300 mn as at 31.12.2019 with a licensed bank may avail of the concessions under this scheme from such licensed bank.

(ii)Upon a written request being made by a borrower on or before 31.01.2020, licensed banks shall offer a capital moratorium during 01.01.2020 to 31.12.2020 in respect of all eligible Rupee term loans.

(iii)Licensed banks shall extend the existing tenure of loans eligible for capital moratorium by the moratorium period without increasing the value of instalments.

(iv)During the period of deferment, the interest shall be charged on the contracted basis without any penal component.

(v)Permanent overdraft facilities falling due for settlement or maturing or are reviewed during the period up to 31.03.2020, shall be extended up to 30.06.2020.

2.2 Every LCB and LSB shall ensure that the continuous decline in market interest rates are reflected on the interest rates charged for all other credit facilities at the time of their renewal or when repricing of such facilities

2.3 Every LCB and LSB shall reduce the penal interest rates charged on all loans and advances, including credit facilities already granted, to a level not exceeding 200 basis points per annum, for the amount in excess of an approved limit or in arrears.

To: CEOs of All Licensed Commercial Banks

Liquidity Facility to the Construction Sector upon ‘Letter of Acceptance of Payments

of Outstanding Bills Due to Contractors’ Issued by the Treasury on behalf of

the Government

This Operating Instructions (OI) replaces OI No. 35/03/023/0001/001 issued on 18.06.2020 on ‘Liquidity Facility to the Construction Sector upon Promissory Notes/Guarantees Issued by the Government’.

This OI will be effective from 03.07.2020 until further notice.

1. Introduction

1.1 Having identified the national importance of reviving economic activities that was adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the instructions of the Government of Sri Lanka, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has introduced a liquidity facility scheme to support the construction sector through Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs).

1.2 The Monetary Board has approved a ‘Liquidity Facility to the Construction Sector’ (LFCS), initially on 16.06.2020 and subsequently on 26.06.2020, for the construction sector enterprises to borrow from LCBs, backed by a ‘Letter of Acceptance of Payments of Outstanding Bills Due to Contractors’ (LAPC) issued by the Treasury on behalf of the Government. In turn, LCBs shall provide promissory notes secured by pledged Treasury bills and Treasury bonds in their own holding to the CBSL to obtain credit facilities at a concessionary rate of interest under Section 83(1) of the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949 (MLA) for on-lending to the construction sector.

1.3 Accordingly, the intention of this OI is to enable LCBs to provide credit facilities to the construction sector backed by the LAPC issued by the Treasury on behalf of the Government and to obtain LFCS from the CBSL at concessionary rates of interest.

Part III

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020

Part III - 37

2. Main Features of the Liquidity Facility

2.1 LFCS provided by the CBSL to LCBs is expected to serve as a liquidity support to address liquidity needs of the construction sector enterprises arising from outstanding dues from the Government of Sri Lanka on account of construction projects carried out in the past.

2.2 LCBs are required to enter into a Loan Agreement and a Pledge Agreement with the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka each time this LFCS is drawn by the LCBs.

2.3 Under LFCS, the CBSL may grant loans to LCBs at a concessionary rate of one per cent (1%) per annum for a period not exceeding 180 days for on-lending to the construction sector enterprises under Section 83(1) of the MLA, upon receipt of promissory notes from LCBs secured by pledged Treasury bills and Treasury bonds with the CBSL. Immediate fresh facilities shall be made available upon submission of similar fresh promissory notes by the LCBs backed by pledged Treasury bills and Treasury bonds with the CBSL.

2.4 LCBs may maintain an interest margin not exceeding three per cent (3%) per annum for this facility, so that the construction sector enterprises shall have access to credit at an interest rate not exceeding four per cent (4%) per annum.

3. Key Operational Requirements

3.1 In order to seek this LFCS, an LCB shall forward details of the construction sector enterprises that have been issued with LAPCs by the Treasury on behalf of the Government as set out in Schedule I and the promissory note as set out in Schedule II, along with the details of government securities which are expected to be pledged for this facility as in Schedule III, to the CBSL. LCBs are advised to submit duly authenticated hard copies of Schedule I and II to the Director of the Domestic Operations Department (DOD). The soft copies of all schedules should be sent to DOD in advance, to facilitate accounting procedures.

3.2 LCBs are required to enter the details of Treasury bills and Treasury bonds to be pledged with the CBSL electronically through the Online Electronic Bidding System (OEBS) and the days to maturity of such pledged securities should be not less than 180 days. Pricing of the pledged securities is based on the existing price calculation used for the government securities by the CBSL.

3.3 On the receipt of duly completed hard copies of the schedules and agreements from an LCB, the Director of the DOD will make arrangements to credit an amount equivalent to the face value of the promissory note to the Current Account of the respective LCBs after verifying the adequacy of the pledged securities in the Schedule III. However, funds shall not be disbursed on the same day unless the hard copies of the duly completed schedules and agreements are received before 12:00 hrs.

3.4 LCBs are required to maintain an adequate amount of securities in their own holding to pledge at the time of releasing funds. Securities pledged under this facility will be transferred to a Securities Settlement Account in the LankaSecure System.

3.5 CBSL may inform LCBs of the details of upcoming maturities two weeks prior to the maturity date of the promissory note.

3.6 On the maturity date of the loan, the CBSL may deduct the principle amount of the loan plus the interest from the Current Account of the respective LCBs. LCBs are required to immediately repay the loan and the interest in the event that the government settles the due payments as set out in the LAPC.

3.7 LCBs should ensure that LFCS is exclusively utilised for on-lending to the construction sector enterprises backed by LAPCs.

3.8 LCBs are required to report to DOD on a fortnight basis on the utilisation of funds obtained under LFCS, as per Schedule IV, as at 15th and 30th of each month within 3 working days from the due date.

3.9 The Bank Supervision Department and the DOD may jointly monitor the implementation of this facility.

Activities mentioned in 2(i) and 2(ii) above are hereinafter referred to as “Captured Activities”.

3. These Guidelines are issued for the purpose of assisting the Service Providers in identifying, assessing and managing Money Laundering (ML) and Terrorist Financing (TF) risks, when carrying out Captured Activities.

4. These Guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive and can be considered only as indicative guidance when developing policies, procedures and controls to achieve compliance with FTRA and other rules and regulations issued thereunder.

- Beneficial Owner means a natural person who ultimately owns or controls a customer or the person on whose behalf a transaction is being conducted and includes the person who exercises ultimate effective control over a person or a legal arrangement.

- CDD means Customer Due Diligence;

- Client means “Customer” as defined in Section 33 of the FTRA;

Vulnerabilities of Accounting Services

6. Some of the services provided by the accountants are more susceptible to money laundering and terrorist financing risks. Therefore, they can be exploited by potential money launderers and terrorist financiers. Accountants are used as gatekeepers in utilizing their expertise to conceal the proceeds of crime. Some such services include:

a) Buying or selling of property – criminals may use property transfers to serve either as a cover for transfers of illegal funds or as a final investment of illicit proceeds, while the transaction may be wholly or part of the laundering process.

2 As defined in Subsection (k) of Designated Non-Finance Business in Section 33 of the FTRA.

Part III

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

Part III - 79

b) Performing financial transactions – criminals or would be offenders may use accountants to carry out or facilitate various financial operations on their behalf (e.g. cash deposits or withdrawals on accounts, retail foreign exchange operations, issuing and cashing cheques, purchase and sale of stock, sending and receiving international funds transfers, etc.).

c) Gaining introductions to financial institutions- criminals may use accountants as introducers or intermediaries. This can occur both ways as criminals may use financial institutions to gain introductions to accountants as well.

d) Company and Trust formation – criminals may attempt to confuse or disguise the links between the proceeds of a crime and the perpetrator through the formation of corporate vehicles or other complex legal arrangements.

7. The professional knowledge, skills and abilities of Accountants are vulnerable to be misused by criminals when conducting ML/TF activities. If, Service Providers are involved knowingly or unknowingly in the case of their clients engaged in ML/TF activities they will have to suffer various disadvantages including loss of reputation and possible legal actions.

8. Criminals or would be offenders may abuse the services provided by accountants to attribute a sense of legitimacy to falsified accounts in order to conceal the source of funds. For example, accountants may review and sign off such accounts for businesses engaged in criminality, thereby facilitating the laundering of the proceeds. Insolvency practice, which may be conducted by certain accountancy professionals also pose a risk of criminals concealing the audit trail of money laundered through a company and transferring the proceeds of crimes.

Vulnerabilities of Trusts or Company Service Providers

9. Trusts or Company Service Providers (TCSPs) provide services relating to the formation and management of companies and trusts which are considered as vulnerable for ML/TF activities.

10. Criminals and would be offenders often use companies, trusts and other similar legal arrangements to hide the origin and ownership of the criminally earned assets/finance terrorist activities.

11. Further, money launderers and terrorist financiers form shell companies which do not have independent operations, significant assets, ongoing business activities, or employees to conceal beneficial ownership, conduct transactions, or bring about a perception of legitimacy.

12. Criminals and would be offenders use address of TCSPs instead of using their physical location which allow them to keep anonymity and distance from the transactions and activities they are undertaking. Further it adds perception of legitimacy to their activities.

13. Criminals and would be offenders obtain the services of TCSPs for the management positions of the companies or trusts in order to provide greater respectability and legitimacy to the company or trust and its activities, to launder money and to finance terrorist activities.

14. Criminals and would be offenders use TCSPs as nominee shareholders or nominee directors or trustees of the companies or trusts or other legal arrangements to obscure their ownership of assets. This may provide a false impression of legitimacy for the activities undertaken by the company or legal arrangement enabling the criminals to use their companies or other legal arrangements for laundering money, financing of terrorism or other crimes without being detected.

Part II

Risk-Based Approach

15. Every Service Provider is required under the CDD Rules to identify and assess their exposure to ML/TF risk and develop suitable policies, procedures and controls to effectively manage and mitigate such risk. It is also expected to monitor the ongoing effectiveness of those policies, procedures and controls. The Risk Based Approach enables the service providers to allocate more resources to areas where the risks are higher.

16. Each Service Provider is expected to use their own judgment, knowledge and expertise to develop an appropriate risk-based approach for their particular organizational structure and business activities based on the nature and size of the Service Provider. Risk assessment is the key starting point of the risk based approach and it is required to commensurate with the nature, size and complexity of the business. Some of the factors that can be considered when developing a risk-based approach are as follows.

- Risks related to the size, geographical location and organizational complexity of the Service Provider.

- Risks related to the specific services offered by the Service Provider

- Risk related to the specific types of the clients

- Risk related to the delivery channels

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020

Part III

Part III - 80

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

These factors can be considered either independent of one another or in combination in order to determine ML/TF risk. For example, a Service Provider that incorporates one or more Captured Activities as formation of companies, managing clients’ money, having clients with complex beneficial ownership structures or known political exposure or in high risk and other monitored jurisdictions3 and/or functioning in a high risk business sector could be more vulnerable to ML/TF than a firm that is exposed to only one of these risk categories.

17. In the context of ML/TF, the Risk-Based Approach encompasses the following steps:

A. Identify the ML/TF risks;

B. Assess the ML/TF risks;

C. Design and implement controls to manage and mitigate the ML/TF risks;

D. Monitor and improve the effective operations of the Risk-Based controls.

(A) Identify the ML/TF Risk

18. As the first step of the Risk-Based Approach, the Service Provider should identify their direct and indirect ML/TF risk factors associated with clients, geographical locations, services and delivery channels.

19. When identifying the risks associated with above mentioned aspects, the Service Provider should consider and document the risk related to:

- Clients including their beneficial owners

• Business or professional activities of clients/ beneficial owners.

• Reputation of clients/ beneficial owners.

• Nature and the behavior of clients/ beneficial owners.

- Geographical locations

• The geographical origin and location of the client/beneficial owner.

• Places of business of the customer/beneficial owner.

• The geographical locations where the customer/beneficial owner have relevant personal links.

- Services

• Types of services offered by the Service Providers.

• Complexity of transaction.

• Value or size of the transaction.

- Delivery channels

• The extent to which the business relationship is conducted on non-face to face basis.

• Any introducers or intermediaries used in the transaction process and nature of their relationship.

20. Examples for ML/TF risks associated with the Captured Activities and sample checklist for ML/TF risk identification and assessment is given respectively in Annexure I and II as a guidance. Service Provider is encouraged to develop a checklist of their own based on their own ML/TF risk identification and assessment, and to this end the Annexure II would provide some guidance.

(B) Assess the ML/TF Risks

21. The ML/TF Risk Assessment is required to be carried out once the Service Provider’s ML/TF risk factors are identified.

The ML/TF Risk Assessment is an analysis of potential threats and vulnerabilities of ML/TF to which the Service Provider is exposed. The complexity of the ML/TF Risk Assessment depends on, among the other factors, the nature, size and ML/TF risks faced by the Service Provider.

22. ML/TF Risk Assessment is carried out irrespective of any existing Policies, procedures and controls on customer identification, record keeping and reporting requirements.

(C) Design and Implement Controls to Manage and Mitigate the ML/TF Risks

23. Risk mitigation is about implementing controls to address risk drivers or the sources of the risk (i.e. threats, vulnerabilities) in a timely manner, which is tolerable to the Service Provider. Controls should be in the form of written policies and procedures.

3 The FATF identifies jurisdictions with weak measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing (AML/CFT) in two FATF public documents.

Annexure II

An Example of a Checklist for Service Provider’s ML and TF Risk Assessments

The following checklist is intended to provide an example of how to assess risk for your customers, products, services, delivery channels and geographic locations. This is only a starting point and the service provider should customize the checklist according to your business. If you already use another risk assessment tool, you can continue to use it or enhance it as necessary.

When risk indicators are high or medium, you should consider risks for money laundering or terrorist financing and appropriate risk responses in the form of policies, procedures and controls to avoid or to control and mitigate the risks, as appropriate for your practice.

Notes to the Risk Assessment

S/NRisk FactorDescription on the Risk Factor

1) Assessing Nature, size and complexity of the Institution

1.1Size of the businessLarger the business, possibility of occurring suspicious activities and transactions during the course of business is higher.

Large organisations may have difficulty in monitoring the implementation of AML/CFT measures to meet AML/CFT requirements.

1.2Ownership structureThe ML/TF risk is higher when the ownership is under foreign/dual citizens or another entity compared to local/ individual ownership.

1.3Complexity of the servicesGreater complexity decreases the transparency of business transactions and activities, increases ML/TF vulnerability and may reduce the effectiveness of AML/CFT measures.

1.4Nature of the services provided and activities recognised as being associated with ML/TF vulnerability

Services or activities which have been identified as high or medium level vulnerable to ML/TF during the National Risk Assessment or high cash intensive businesses.

2) Client Risk

2.1Ownership structureComplex and non-transparent structures may hide and disguise beneficial ownership/effective control and disguise ML/TF activities. Client may establish legal entities in a chain of multi-jurisdictional structures to hide the true ownership and control of assets held overseas.

2.2Clients in high-risk occupationsSome occupations can have greater vulnerability to ML/TF. (For example, cash intensive businesses, gatekeeper occupations, jewellers, high-value goods dealers, real estate agents, travel agents, import/export companies, remitters and money service businesses)

2.3Clients residing outside Sri LankaClients who are foreigners or Sri Lankan expatriates residing in other countries.

2.4Clients reside in high-risk jurisdictionClient reside in a high-risk jurisdiction pose a higher level of ML/TF vulnerability to the service provider.

2.5Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs)Due to their position and influence, PEPs are in positions that potentially can be abused for the purpose of committing ML offences and related predicate offences, including corruption and bribery, as well as conducting activity related to TF.

2.6Clients are located in a known high crime rate areaClients reside in a knowing area for high crime rate may create a higher level of ML/TF vulnerability to the service provider.

2.7Client’s physical locationIt is difficult to track down the true identity of a client who does not have an address or who have several addresses. This will result in high ML/TF vulnerability to the service provider.

2.8Clients with criminal records or links to organized crimeWhen the clients have prior criminal records or links to organised crimes. The ML/TF vulnerability posed by such customers become high.

3) Services risk

3.1Services support physical cash deposits and/or withdrawalsThe ease of movement of cash without audit trail makes it highly vulnerable to ML/TF activity. If the offered services by your Institution provide platform to deposit or obtain cash (e.g. at ATMs, at point of sale, or through a cash advance transaction) then ML/TF risk of such occasions should be considered. When these cash transactions are in a large amounts it will compound the ML/TF risk.

3.3Services that facilitates international fund transfersIf the services facilitate inward or outward remittances, such remittances which are received or paid avoided the stipulated mechanisms (IIA, OIA).

3.3Services support payments to/from third parties or non-clientsThis can disguise the beneficial ownership or effective control of funds. The presence of multiple intermediaries and agents can hide and disguise beneficial ownership.

3.4Services support transactions that can be conducted remotely or without interaction with the service provider

Less face-to-face interaction with a customer increases vulnerability to ML/TF activity. Especially online activity can facilitate high-frequency and high-value activity on an international level, often with little or no interaction between the service provider and client.

Part III

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

Part III - 89

3.5Provide services linked with establishing, operating or managing of a shell company, company in nominal ownership.

Shell companies (also called phantom firms or anonymous companies) are entities that are used to disguise the identity of their true owner) who ultimately control or profit from the company.

3.6Conducts transactions without clear commercial rationaleCriminals do transactions without any specific reason to hide criminally earned money. This will create a high ML/TF vulnerability.

4) Delivery Channels/Business Relationships Risk

4.1Method of delivery remove or minimise face-to-face contact with the customer

Non- face-to-face interaction with a customer increases vulnerability to ML/TF activities.

4.2Third party can be used as delivery channelsThis may result in your client’s identity, beneficial owner or effective controller not being transparent, which increases ML/TF risk.

4.3Delivery channels involving cross-border paymentsCross border payments, foreign remittances, and transfers from foreign currency accounts involve high ML/TF risk.

4.4Delivery channels involving cash paymentsThe ease of movement of cash without audit trail makes it highly vulnerable to ML/TF activity. If there are high volume cash payments involved then ML/TF risk of such occasions should be considered.

5) Geographical Risk

5.1Dealings with countries that have weak or ineffective AML/CFT measures or subject to sanctions, embargoes or similar measures issued by the United Nations Securities Council Resolution (UNSCR)

Some countries have been identified by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as non-cooperative in the fight against money laundering or terrorist financing aa well as United Nations impose sanctions against some countries. Clients from such countries poses high ML/TF risk to the service provider.

5.2Dealings with countries where illegal activities are taken place.The presence of a high level of organised crime is an important consideration in determining country risk.

5.3Dealings with countries that have a high degree of corruption and bribery

The presence of a high level of bribery and corruption is an important consideration and a primary driver in determining country risk. Bribery and corruption fundamentally weaken any AML/CFT regime.

5.4Dealings with countries that are in a conflict zone or have significant terrorism activity or as providing funding or support for terrorist activities

Conflict zones present an extremely high risk of TF and ML. Tracing the flow of funds into and through these regions is extremely difficult. Non-profit organisations operating in these zones may be vulnerable to abuse or used as cover.

5.5Any country identified as a financial secrecy haven or jurisdiction

Financial secrecy occurs when there is a refusal to share financial information of a person/entity with legitimate authorities - for example, tax authorities and police authorities. Hence, when dealing with customers from such countries the barriers on obtaining their financial information shall be assessed in terms of high or low ML/TF risk.

5.6Branches and subsidiaries of the Institution are located in other countries

When the service provider’s branches or agents are located in other jurisdictions the ML/TF risk may be high or low depending on the factors such as AML/CFT deficiencies, measures and laws prevailing in those countries.

Financial Institutions are advised to be vigilant to emerging Money Laundering/ Terrorist Financing risks

Further to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) Email dated March 23, 2020 on the above,

The Financial Institutions (FIs) are advised to increase the vigilance/ due diligence and take appropriate measures to protect the financial system from possible money laundering/terrorist financing risks arising during the global COVID-19 Pandemic. Accordingly, your attention is drawn to following factors,

a) The FIU has been informed of several cyber-attacks and hacking incidents where the funds have been transferred using false/erroneous email credentials. Accordingly, FIs are requested to continue to remain alert against possible security breaches and take measures to prevent such incidents occurring, and alert the possible victims of such attacks immediately.

b) The disclosures received by the FIU from state intelligence and law enforcement agencies and STRs received has led the FIU to believe an increasing trend of terrorist financing, financial fraud and use of charitable organizations to exploit the vulnerabilities that arose with the global Covid-19 pandemic situation.

c) FIs should take precautionary measures against cyber criminals and hackers looking to take advantage of the current situation prevailing within and outside the country. As with the COVID-19 outbreak customers were encouraged to use more online/internet banking which may have led to unforeseen increase in system vulnerabilities.

Guidelines for Non Face-to-Face Customer Identification and Verification Using Electronic Interface Provided by the Department for Registration of Persons, No. 3 of 2020 Part I

Introduction

1. These Guidelines are issued pursuant to section 15(1) (j) of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 06 of 2006 (FTRA).

2. These Guidelines are issued to Financial Institutions (FIs) and Insurers1 (INs) to facilitate verification of identity (verification against the original document) when onboarding non face-to-face2 individual customers (natural persons) using electronic interface provided by the Department for Registration of Persons (hereinafter referred to as DRP).

3. These Guidelines will come into force with immediate effect and shall be read together with the FTRA and Financial Institutions (Customer Due Diligence) Rules, No. 01 of 2016 (FI CDD Rules) and Insurers (Customer Due Diligence) Rules, No. 1 of 2019 (IN CDD Rules)as amended from time to time.

4. These Guidelines may be modified from time to time or withdrawn in the event of any unforeseen risks arising in the future or when more effective and reliable methods for establishing and verifying customer identity in non face-to-face onboarding come into force.

Part II

Scope

5. These Guidelines provide alternate methods to meet the requirement of “verification against original document” for individual customers who are natural persons as detailed in the following:

a) Schedule to the FI CDD Rules under Rule 27 – Item (1) (b)(i)—verification of identity document b) Schedule to the FI CDD Rules under Rule 27 – Item (1) (b)(ii)—verification of addressc) Schedule to the IN CDD Rules under Rule 26 and 41 – Item (1) (b)(i)—verification of identity document d) Schedule to the IN CDD Rules under Rule 26 and 41 – Item (1) (b)(ii)—verification of address

6. All other requirements imposed under CDD Rules will be applicable to customers onboarded using the above method without any exception.

Part III

Methods of Application

7. Verification of individual customer identity document

a. Claimed Identity3. FIs must continue to identify their customers in full accordance with CDD Rule 27(1)(a) and obtain all information described in Rule 27(1)(b) from the customer.

Claimed identity information may be obtained by the FI/IN in any manner that safeguards its integrity during the process of transmission. Potential modes of obtaining identity information include but are not limited to electronic forms, mobile app, video conferencing, secure email, kiosks/ ATMs/ CDMs, registered post, etc.

b. Existence of Claimed Identity. FIs may use electronic interface published by the DRP to obtain information to independently validate the customer’s claimed identity, provided:

i. The interface is accessed with the unique credentials assigned to the FI/IN by the DRP; ii. The interface is accessed strictly in accordance with its terms of use;iii. The interface returns to the FI/IN:

(a) a record that uniquely matches the claimed identity information provided by the customer in a form suitable for verification of customer identity claims, and(b) such record includes an image of the person to whom the identity has been assigned to, and(c) the image rendered is suitable for the purpose of associating the record with the claimed identity of the customer;

iv. The FI/IN has no reasonable indication to believe that the interface, or the effectiveness thereof, has been maliciously compromised in any way.

1. Insurers shall have the same definition as provided for in the Rule 2 of the Insurers (Customer Due Diligence) Rules, No. 1 of 2019,2. Non-face-to-face interactions are considered to occur remotely, meaning the parties are not in the same physical location and conduct activities by digital or other non-physically-present means3. Claimed Identity refer to an applicant’s declaration of not validated and unverified personal attributes.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020

Part III

Part III - 96

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

c. Associating Claimed Identity with Customer. The following steps must be performed in order to associate the claimed identity with the customer:

i. Obtaining Customer Imagery and other documents from the Customer:

High-quality still images4 of the customer, ID documents and address verification documents must be obtained. For customers not physically present in Sri Lanka, passport images must also be obtained containing customer biographical data, a current visa and an entry stamp or any other entry permitting official document for the country where they are located. The imagery should be of sufficient quality to read details and to inspect generic security features5 of the identity document, to identify unique facial features of the customer, and to detect any potential alterations to the document. Ideally, the imagery should be obtained from a device known to be associated with the customer (e.g. a mobile phone) or from a dedicated device operated by, or on behalf of, the FI/IN (e.g. kiosk devices).

ii. Obtaining Customer Real-Time Video from the Customer

A staff member of the FI/IN must engage in a high-quality real-time video6 conference with the customer and verify the possession of his identity documents and address verification documents during this real-time video conference. For customers not physically located in Sri Lanka, passport and visa data from (i) must also be verified. The customer should respond via real-time video conference to FI/IN inquiries in order to establish the authenticity of the imagery and the accuracy of other customer provided information.

iii. Obtaining Customer Imagery from DRP

FIs must use electronic interface published by DRP in order to obtain information to authenticate the validated identity information against the customer claimed identity, in accordance with the provisions detailed in paragraph 7(b). As a practical matter, the only currently available information for this purpose is a photographic image associated with a National Identity Card (NIC).

FI/IN must maintain a record on identity information obtained through DRP electronic interface for each customer (eg. audit log, unique reference, or screenshot).

iv. Authenticating Claimed Identity to Customer

The following modes shall be used to authenticate the claimed Identity to the Customer:

1. Algorithmically: FIs that intend to authenticate a claimed identity algorithmically using data and images obtained from both the customer and DRP must obtain prior approval from the FIU in the form of an “enforcement forbearance” by submitting an application to the CBSL “Regulatory Sandbox” and completing the FIU’s addendum to the application. Without such forbearance obtained and followed up by entering to an FI/IN agreement with the FIU to abide by the terms of the forbearance, FIs/INs are not permitted to authenticate claimed identities using this mode.

The Sandbox Framework documents along with the Sandbox application form can be downloaded at https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/en/public-notices. For any inquiries or clarification contact Payments and Settlements Department of Central Bank of Sri Lanka on 2477542, 2477642 or e-mail to sandbox@cbsl.lk.

2. Manually: Manual comparison by employees of the FI/IN should be made in all cases when an algorithmic comparison has not been approved by the FIU through guidelines or specific letters of forbearance [e.g. obtained through the CBSL Regulatory Sandbox]. The standard for successful non face-to-face authentication should be at least as rigorous as for the FI/IN’s face-to-face mode.

3. A combination of algorithmic and manual modes may also be used. However, if the algorithmic mode employed has not been approved by the FIU through guidelines or specific letters of forbearance then the manual mode must function as the sole determinative.

When the claimed identity cannot be verified or authenticated the FI/IN must not enter into a business relationship with the customer or process transactions on behalf of the customer using this alternative verification method.

8. Verification of Individual Customer Address

Individual Customer addresses may be verified using data matching the customer’s claimed identity obtained by the FI/IN through a DRP electronic interface. If the residential address provided by the customer differs from the address obtained through a DRP electronic interface, the FI/IN must instead verify the customer’s address using independent data or services provided electronically FI/IN from one or more sources7 or obtaining high quality images of the address verification documents

4. High-quality still images refer to resolution equivalent to 300 PPI/ DPI (Pixels Per Inch / Dots Per Inch) or higher.5. Generic security features refer to features of the identity document generally visible when the physical document is inspected6. High-quality real-time video refers to consistent resolution equivalent to 360p (pixels) or higher with minimal frame droppage7. Independent data or services provided electronically from one or more sources (for address verification) refer to use of utility service providers websites or mobile applications for bill payments which indicate the address with the name.

Part III

or obtaining e-statements of address verification documents specified in Schedule to the FI CDD Rules under Rule 27- Item (1)(a)(a1)(iii) or IN CDD Rules under Rule 26 and 41- Item (1)(a)(a1)(iii).

9. Instances where FIs should refrain from opening accounts or establishing business relationships non face-to-face.

a. When non face-to-face customer uses any other identification document other than national identity card such as passport or driver’s license to identify himself.

b. When high quality interactive real time video of the customer cannot be obtained.

c. When high quality data and still images of customer identity documents cannot be obtained.

d. When identity documents presented by the customer appear to be damaged or degraded to the point that the documents are no longer fit for the purpose of identification.

e. When identity documents presented by the customer appear altered or when document’s generic security features cannot be validated or when the integrity of the document is suspected under any other reason.

f. When the customer refuses or unable to comply with any aspect of the FI/IN’s established non face-to-face onboarding procedures. The customer cannot be on boarded using the non-face-to-face mode if customer fails to cooperate with full completion of the FI/IN’s established non face-to-face onboarding procedure. Such non-compliance can take many different forms including but not limited to a refusal or inability to adjust ambient lighting, a refusal or inability to remove anything that obscures a clear view of the customer’s face, customer’s refusal or inability to remain still or to still the image capturing device, customer’s refusal or inability to answer questions posed by the onboarding officer(s).

g. When a failure of FI/IN systems prevents the FI/IN from fully executing their established non face-to-face onboarding procedures to include, for example, recording and secure storage of onboarding video and image captures of identity documents.

h. When the claimed identity cannot be shown to exist using the DRP electronic interface.

i. When details of the customer’s claimed identity are not consistent with details obtained for the claimed identity through the DRP electronic interface.

j. When a non face-to-face customer presents a NIC with a photo image, which the onboarding officer matches with data and imagery from the DRP, but unable to positively match with the current appearance of the customer claiming the identity.

k. When a non face-to-face customer appears to have intentionally modified his appearance in a manner intended to compromise the ability of the FI/IN to accurately identify and verify the customer and to fully complete its established non face-to-face onboarding procedure.

l. When a claimed identity cannot be authenticated to the customer due to an inability to match, with a high degree of confidence, the images obtained of the customer and of the customer identity documents with corresponding images obtained from DRP.

m. When the FI/IN has reason to doubt the veracity of any customer claims, whether related to identity or otherwise.

n. When customer behavior causes the FI/IN to doubt the legal intents or purposes of the customer in establishing business relations.

o. When the FI/IN is unable to identify the current location (eg. using Global Positioning System (GPS) or any other suitable mechanism to identify the location8 and to determine whether customer is a resident or a non-resident) of the customer by the FI.

p. Where the FI/IN has a reasonable suspicion on the authenticity of the document(s) in any manner.

10. Policies, Training, Record Keeping and Audit

a. The FI/IN must establish clear policies and procedures for non face-to-face customer identification and onboarding prior to applying the alternate methods described herein.

b. The FI/IN must conduct at least an entry level training programme and carry out ongoing training for relevant onboarding staff prior to applying the alternate methods described herein. The FI/IN should extend adequate training to staff relevant

8. any other suitable mechanism to identify the location refer to use of IP address, calling landline phone number, calling foreign phone number, current visa and an entry stamp or any such mechanism to identify resident, non-resident status.

d. FI/IN customer identification programmes using the alternate methods described herein must be included in the FI/IN’s internal audit scope under Anti Money Laundering and Combating the Finance of Terrorism (AML/CFT) aspects in order to determine efficacy of the programme and to detect operational deviations from policy.

Part IV

Risk Management

11. The non face-to-face methods of identity verification described herein must be considered in the context of the FI/IN’s “risk-based approach” prior to use. The FI/IN’s risk assessment must be updated to reflect the impact of the non face-to-face methods.

12. Customer risk profiles must reflect any non face-to-face methods of identification used for the purpose of their identification.

Creation of necessary user accounts in CIMM in order to facilitate this process is the sole responsibility of individual Banks. If new user accounts are required to create in this regard, Banks are required to inform the same to IOD to make necessary arrangements to facilitate it.

3. In case, if any Bank is required to make any amendment to the previously submitted NOP report;

(i) Such Bank is required to inform to the Domestic Forex Market Division of IOD via the hotlines of 0112477595 / 0761754680 and with a request including a brief explanation for the amendment through an e-mail to dfx@cbsl.lk.

(ii) Upon reverting the previously submitted NOP report of such Bank in CIMM by IOD, such Bank is required to re-enter and approve the accurate NOP report in the CIMM and inform IOD immediately.

4. If a Bank is unable to submit the daily NOP report through the CIMM within the stipulated time, for reasons beyond its control, such Bank is required to submit such daily NOP report electronically via an e-mail to dfx@cbsl.lk or paper return via fax (0112346282) on a temporary basis adhering to the same time frame as given above. However, such Bank is required to submit the same through the CIMM at its earliest possible time.

Operating Instructions for the Incentive Scheme on Inward Worker Remittances

With an objective of encouraging more workers’ remittances to the country through formal fund transferring channels, the budget 2021 has proposed to pay Rs. 2 per dollar above the normal exchange rate for the foreign exchange remittances sent by foreign workers to banks in Sri Lanka (the mechanism)”. It is expected that the benefit of such incentive is passed to the workers and / or their beneficiaries and not to the intermediaries which are associated in the process of channeling such worker remittances into the country.

Accordingly, all Licensed Banks (LBs) are hereby instructed to adhere to the following Operating Instructions (OIs) in operatizing the mechanism.

1. Scope of Application

Applicable to all LBs which are engaged in collecting and disbursing workers’ remittances flowing into the country.

2. Remittances Qualifying for the Incentive

(i) The foreign currency income earned through an employment by a Sri Lankan national who is working/has worked abroad will qualify to receive an additional LKR 2.00 per US Dollar (USD) remitted and converted to LKR w.e.f. 28.12.2020.

(ii) Accordingly, all LBs are required to maintain comprehensive due diligence procedures and internal controls to identify qualifying remittances for the incentive.

3. Payment of the Incentive

The Table 01 below depicts possible formal channels of worker remittances and the point of paying an additional LKR 2.00 per USD (hereafter referred as “the incentive”).

Table 01: Possible Formal Channels of Worker Remittances and Point of Paying the Incentive

Channel of RemittancePoint of Paying the Incentive

(a) Direct Fund Transfers to Personal Foreign Currency Accounts (PFCAs)When the PFCA is debited for the foreign currency amount and the same is converted in to LKRIf the converted LKR amount is used to transfer to an institution for the purposes such as bills, loans etc., the LB should debit the PFCA at a lesser foreign currency amount by adjusting the incentive of Rs. 2.00 per USD.

(b) Converting Foreign Currency NotesWhen the foreign currency notes are converted in to LKR

(c) Intermediaries*When the customer and / or a beneficiary is paid in LKRThe incentive should be paid and recorded by the LB where the customer and / or a beneficiary receives LKR either over the counter or credit to an account

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020

Part III

Part III - 104

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

* When worker remittances are channeled through an intermediary in LKR, the LKR amounts of each customer and /or ben-eficiary should be converted in to USD by using the “Middle USD / LKR Exchange Rate (rounded-off to its two decimal places)” published by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) at the end of the previous business day and the incentive should be calculated and paid based on such converted amount (rounded-off to its two decimal places) of USD. The “Mid-dle USD / LKR Exchange Rate” should be derived through the average of buying and selling USD / LKR exchange rates for Telegraphic Transfers (TT) published by the CBSL.

4. Payment of the Incentive on Remittances in Foreign Currencies Other than USD

LBs shall use the available indicative exchange rate published by the CBSL on previous business day to derive the USD amount for the calculation and payment of the incentive on worker remittances which are denominated in foreign currencies other than USD (rounded-off to its two decimal places). When there is no indicative exchange rate published by the CBSL, LBs shall use an appropriate reflective exchange rate.

Hence, Derived USD amount should be;

(Amount in Other Currency x Other Currency / LKR Indicative or Reflective Exchange Rate) ÷ Middle USD / LKR Exchange Rate as specified in Section 3 above

5. Accounting and Reporting of Incentive Payments

(i) LBs are required to maintain separate accounts in respect of the incentives paid in a distinct receivable account with all necessary documents to support the payments.

(ii) Within 15 days after the end of each quarter, LBs are required to submit information on incentives paid during the quarter to the International Operations Department (IOD) of the CBSL (with a copy to the Bank Supervision Department of the CBSL) as per the template provided by IOD to arrange the reimbursement of the same by the General Treasury. The template for the information to be submitted to IOD will be issued by the Director/IOD in due course.

6. For further information, you may contact IOD of the CBSL on 0112398711, 0112477595 or 0761754680.

Transaction Reference Number (TRN) Format

TRN field contains 16 digits.

New TRN format requires the first 4 digits to be allocated specifically for classifying the transaction and the remaining 12 digits can be used by the Participant for own referencing/ numbering.

For a single Trade and its relating transactions, the ‘Participant Generated Reference Number’ (PGRN) should be the same (if required, last digit(s) sequencing2 may be used).

E.g. TRN for reversal of Repos which are to be input on auto reversal instructions (SWIFT field :20C::SECO//) should follow the same number format, where 2nd digit (X2 below) should be “V” to represent the reversal of a repo transaction followed by the original repo transaction reference given in PGRN.

(d) Usual components of working capital, such as raw material, etc., shall be excluded if the business is non-operational.

3. Priority:

(a) PFIs shall give priority to applications from micro, small and medium sized businesses and businesses that are pivotal in protecting employment and production.

(b) In this regard, first priority should be given for micro and small sized businesses which can manage with less than Rs. 10 million working capital and the second priority should be on the medium and high-medium sized businesses which can manage with a working capital of between Rs 10 million and Rs. 25 million.

(c) Applications from other eligible businesses and businesses whose working capital requirement is above Rs 25 million should be considered on a case by case basis, depending on the importance of such businesses for employment and production, in consultation with the Regional Development Department (RDD) of CBSL.

It was observed that that there are different loan types or different names used by different companies in addition to the general loan facilities they provided like “term loans” “leases”, etc., and several customer complaints have received by us and the CBSL management that LFCs/SLCs are refusing to provide moratorium for those types of facilities saying that such loans are not covered in the cited circulars.

We would like to inform you that though those different names are not mentioned in the circulars issued by CBSL, if these facilities have obtained for the sectors identified in the Section 2 of the circular No 5 of 2020, and Individual’s income/Business have been really affected by covid-19 and with sufficient proof of documents that person/Business obtained the facility for that purpose, those customers are eligible for the moratorium. i.e., customer may have obtained a facility for tourism related activity but the loan name is not mentioned in the circular. If customer can prove that facility has obtained for the tourism related activity and his income got affected due to the current situation, he is eligible for the moratorium.

Finance Business Act Directions No. 05 of 2020 18 June 2020

AMENDMENT TO THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DIRECTION

In terms of powers conferred by Section 12 of the Finance Business Act No.42 of 2011, the Monetary Board hereby issues the following amendment to the Finance Companies (Corporate Governance) Direction No. 03 of 2008, issued to Licensed Finance Companies (LFCs) in Sri Lanka.

Having considered the limited ability especially in the presently prevailing, challenging environment, of attracting experienced personnel with impeccable track records to the Board of Directors (BODs) of the non-banking financial institution sector, the Monetary Board considers that it is prudent to provide a degree of continuity in BODs, subject to the qualification that such continuity, from an objective perspective, is in the best interests of the LFCs.

1.Applicability and ScopeNotwithstanding the provisions of Direction 5(1) of the Finance Companies (Corporate Governance) Direction No. 3 of 2008, an LFC may, with the prior approval of the Monetary Board, permit a Director who is already holding office, and who attains the age of 70 years on or after the date of this Direction comes into effect, to continue in office as director, subject to strict adherence to the following requirements and conditions of this Direction and the accompanying Guidelines.

2.Prior Approval of the Monetary Board Any extension of the time period, will be subject to the prior approval of the Monetary Board.

3.Terms and ConditionsThe terms and conditions and the procedure to be followed, are stipulated in the Guidelines annexed to this Direction.

4.Effective Date and Validity periodThe Direction will be effective with immediate effect and the Direction shall be in effect for a period of three years from the date of the said Direction, subject to renewability upon the completion of three year period, at the discretion of the Monetary Board.

1.1. The provisions of this Guideline shall be applicable only in respect of Directors of an LFC who are serving in the said capacity, as at the date of the Direction, and in the event of any such LFC deciding to continue the service of such Directors beyond the age of 70 years, in the future.

2. Assessment Criteria

2.1. The Directors who have reached the age of 70 years, will be assessed by the Monetary Board (MB) of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), based on the criteria that have been formulated in order to objectively assess fitness and propriety, as well as the contribution made by such Directors to the financial institution and the level of regulatory compliance of such financial institution.

2.2. If an LFC wishes to continue a Director beyond the age of 70 years, the following documents are required to be submitted in order for the MB to evaluate the suitability of approving any extension of the period of service, which will be done by the MB on a case by case basis. However, in no instance will a Director be permitted to function beyond the age of 75 years.

The resolution shall be adopted not more than 6 months prior to the date on which exemption will be required to be effective.

(iii) The reasons set out in such resolution must be sufficiently descriptive and adequate, in order to permit the MB to arrive at an informed decision on the matter and must be supported by documentation, as far as possible. In the event of the MB requiring any further documentation in support of the request for extension, the relevant LFC shall duly furnish the same to the Director, Department of Supervision of Non-bank Financial Institutions (D/SNBFI), for submission before the MB.

CBSL observed that the proposed Scheme may not cause an undue level of stress or threaten the stability of the NBFI sector considering the lower level of exposure to the tourism sector by NBFI sector and measures proposed by the Ministry of Tourism to revive the tourism industry. Accordingly, this Circular is issued to give effect to the Scheme in a consistent manner across all NBFIs.

(iii) Debt moratorium refers to moratorium for both capital and interest for a further period of six months commencing 1 October 2020 to 31 March 2021.

Finance Business Act Guidelines No. 01 of 2020 30 November 2020

PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION FRAMEWORK

FOR LICENSED FINANCE COMPANIES

In terms of powers conferred by Section 13 of the Finance Business Act No. 42 of 2011 (FBA), the Monetary Board hereby issues the following Guidelines on the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) Framework for Licensed Finance Companies (LFCs) with a view to ensuring financial soundness through better risk management policies and practices, improve governance structure in order to protect the interest of depositors and maintain public confidence in the financial system.

In terms of the Section 60 (2) of the FBA, the Monetary Board hereby delegates the authority to take actions mentioned below in terms of Section 12 (1) read with Section 12 (5) and Section 25 (1) to Director, Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions (Director, DSNBFI), where necessary. Regulatory actions mentioned below falling under Section 31 and 37 will be initiated in terms of the provisions of the FBA.

1.Applicability of the Guidelines1.1PCA is applicable to all LFCs and outlines the minimum corrective actions applicable when certain capital-based triggers are met.

1.2This Guideline shall be applicable with effect from 01 July 2022.

2.PCA Capital Categories2.1Five (5) PCA capital categories have been established based on the requirements of minimum capital adequacy ratios in terms of the Finance Business Act Direction No. 03 of 2018 on Capital Adequacy Requirements: (i) well capitalized; (ii) adequately capitalized; (iii) under-capitalized; (iv) significantly under-capitalized; or (v) critically under-capitalized.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020

Part III

Part III - 266

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

4.4Further, if a material event occurs between reporting periods that causes a LFC to be placed in a lower PCA capital category, the LFC must notify the Director DSNBFI that the LFC’s PCA capital ratios have changed (i.e. due to accounting adjustments resulting from an external audit). The LFC must provide details of the change in writing to the CBSL within ten (10) working days of the material event.

4.5LFCs may appeal for review of their PCA category between reporting periods if there is sufficient evidence available that they meet the minimum requirements for a higher PCA category. An Appeal Committee within the Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions will review the request for appeal and will accept or reject the appeal within seven (7) working days.

5.Supervisory Discretion in Determining PCA Category5.1The Director DSNBFI maintains a robust supervisory framework for LFCs and regularly evaluates capital, asset quality, liquidity, operational soundness, etc., through a robust on-site and off-site review process. These efforts assist the Director DSNBFI to detect potential deterioration in the financial soundness of LFC, assess it risk profile and enact appropriate supervisory actions. If a LFC is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or engaged in an unsafe practice, the Director DSNBFI may under certain circumstances, reclassify a LFC to the successive PCA category. Once reclassified, the LFC may be subject to one or more limitations, requirements, and restrictions applicable to that category under PCA.

5.2The Director DSNBFI will recommend a change in PCA category to the MB citing evidence of determination that the LFC is operating in unsafe and unsound condition. If the Monetary Board concurs with the findings, a notice will be sent to the LFC informing of the proposed change in status and citing both the cause and the additional requirements associated with the revised PCA category.

5.3The LFC will have ten (10) days to appeal the change in status. If upon review, the Monetary Board determines that the new PCA category remains warranted, the LFC will be so notified and the PCA category will be put into effect.

6.Disclosure of PCA status6.1When a LFC is less than adequately capitalized and for each successive PCA category, the Director DSNBFI will disclose the corrective action to the public together with proposed action to rectify the non-compliances. Once the institution is determined to be no longer under prompt corrective action status, the Director DSNBFI will update the public accordingly.

6.2LFCs are prohibited from disclosing their PCA capital categories in advertisements or promotional materials, unless such disclosure is required by a direction or authorized by the Director DSNBFI.

7.Capital Restoration Plan7.1An under-capitalized LFC shall submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to the Director DSNBFI within thirty (30) days of notification that it is under-capitalized.

7.2The capital restoration plan shall specify:(a) a strategic plan for the LFC;(b) current and pro-forma financial statements;(c) current and long-term budgets;(d) an analysis of prospective sources of capital;

(e) a list of supporting assumptions;(f) the steps the LFC will take to become adequately capitalized; (g) the levels of capital to be attained during each year in which the plan will be in effect; (h) how the LFC will comply with the provisions in effect under PCA; (i) the types and levels of activities in which the LFC will engage;(j) provide any additional information/documents as required by the CBSL;

7.3The Director DSNBFI will review the capital restoration plan for its viability and ensure that the plan is likely to succeed in restoring the LFC’s capital, will not materially increase the risk to the LFC and includes affidavits that the LFC will comply with the plan until the LFC has been adequately capitalized on average during each of four (4) consecutive calendar quarters.

Part III - 267

7.4The Director DSNBFI will review the capital restoration plan within ten (10) working days after the plan is submitted and inform the LFC of acceptance/rejection of the aforementioned plan.

7.5The Director DSNBFI will closely monitor the LFC’s financial condition on a monthly basis and evaluate progress against the capital restoration plan and compliance with applicable provisions. If the capital restoration plan, restrictions or requirements are insufficient for supporting a return to health, the CBSL may downgrade the LFC’s PCA category (notwithstanding the PCA provisions as per Guideline 3), enact more stringent regulatory actions or require a new capital restoration plan, as needed.

7.6The Director DSNBFI may require a LFC to submit all relevant documents or information, including documents or information relating to an individual / investing entity, investing entity’s associate or related companies, and their ultimate beneficial owners (Annex I).

8.Asset Growth Restrictions of Under-capitalized LFCs8.1Average total assets of an under-capitalized LFC during any calendar quarter must not exceed its average total assets during the preceding quarter unless:

(a) the CBSL has approved its capital restoration plan;(b) the increase in total assets is consistent with the approved capital restoration plan; and(c) the LFC’s total risk-based capital ratio increases during the calendar quarter at a rate sufficient to enable it to become adequately capitalized within a reasonable time.

9.Restrictions on Interest Rates Payable on Deposits by Under-capitalized LFCs

9.1LFCs which are under-capitalized shall be restricted from paying interest rates in excess of the prevailing rates on deposits of comparable amounts and maturities, if necessary, as per below;(a) 100 basis points lower than the maximum interest rate payable as per the direction10. Time line to improve PCA Category10.1Non-compliant LFCs (under-capitalized or significantly under-capitalized LFCs) are granted a maximum period of one (1) year to improve the status of LFCs as adequately capitalized.

10.2When such LFCs fail to comply with above, they shall consolidate/exit as per the CBSL approved plan.

11. Transitional Provisions11.1LFCs which are noncompliant with CAR currently, are subject to any PCA provisions recommended by the CBSL.

12. Reporting Requirements12.1Progress of the regulatory actions taken shall be reported to the Monetary Board on quarterly basis.
