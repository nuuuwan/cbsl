These measures were implemented to facilitate licensed banks to assist businesses and individuals affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Consequently, while overall market interest rates have declined in recent weeks, the Monetary Board anticipates a further reduction in overall market lending rates, thereby encouraging borrowing for productive economic activity and reinforcing support for COVID- 19 hit businesses as well as the broader economy, given the conditions of subdued inflation. The Monetary Board has therefore, decided to adopt targeted measures to reduce specific interest rates that it considered to be excessive, which would help marginal borrowers.",

    "text": "With a view to meeting the challenges faced by the tourism industry due to the Easter Sunday Attack and the outbreak of COVID-19, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has implemented debt moratorium schemes since April 2019. Considering the ongoing travel restrictions, disruption to economic activities and representations made by the Ministry of Tourism and related agencies, CBSL requests licensed commercial banks and licensed specialised banks (hereinafter referred to as licensed banks), to provide a debt moratorium to COVID-19 affected businesses and individuals in the tourism sector (hereinafter referred to as the Scheme) for a further period of six months commencing from 1 October 2020 to 31 March 2021. CBSL observed that the proposed Scheme may not cause an undue level of stress or threaten the stability of the banking system considering the lower level of exposure to the tourism sector by licensed banks, the capital buffers maintained by licensed banks and measures proposed by the Ministry of Tourism to revive the tourism industry. Accordingly, this Circular is issued to give effect to the Scheme in a consistent manner across all licensed banks. However, licensed banks may offer any additional concessions to borrowers in a way that the overall benefits to borrowers are not less than the benefits offered under this Circular.",

Considering the ongoing travel restrictions, disruption to economic activities and representations made by the Ministry of Tourism and related agencies, CBSL requests licensed finance companies and specialised leasing companies (hereinafter referred to as Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs), to provide a debt moratorium to COVID-19 affected businesses and individuals in the tourism sector (hereinafter referred to as the Scheme) for a further period of six months commencing from 1 October 2020 to 31 March 2021. CBSL observed that the proposed Scheme may not cause an undue level of stress or threaten the stability of the NBFI sector considering the lower level of exposure to the tourism sector by NBFI sector and measures proposed by the Ministry of Tourism to revive the tourism industry. Accordingly, this Circular is issued to give effect to the Scheme in a consistent manner across all NBFIs. However, NBFIs may offer any additional concessions to borrowers in a way that the overall benefits to borrowers are not less than the benefits offered under this Circular.",
