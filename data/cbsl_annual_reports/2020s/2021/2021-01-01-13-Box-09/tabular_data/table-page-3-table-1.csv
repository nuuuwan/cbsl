on  maximising 
the  usage  of  available  cybersecurity 
resources to protect their IT assets.   
d)  User awareness
User awareness can be considered as the most important 
part of cybersecurity, as it is the users who create system 
vulnerabilities 
that  pave  way 
criminals to enter into the organisational systems.  The 
demarcation between official and personal tasks seems 
to have disintegrated as observed in the use of personal 
devices  for  official  work  and  vice  versa.  Hence,  this 
too,  is  a  risk  to  cybersecurity  if  such  devices  are  not 
maintained properly with the required security features. 
Users  are  often  unaware  of  these  risks.  This  puts  the 
onus  of  awareness  on  cybersecurity  and  staying  safe 
on all individuals.  Organisations must focus more on 
creating  user  awareness  among  employees.  Schools 
and universities should also do the same.
e)  Working closely with National Computer 
Incident Response Teams (CIRT)
Most  of 
the 
countries 
Computer Incident Response Teams (CIRT) that serve as 
the  national  focus  point  for  coordinating  cybersecurity 
incident  responses  to  cyber-attacks  within  a  country.","","Coordination  Centre  (Sri  Lanka  CERT)  is  the  national 
CIRT 
for  Sri  Lanka  and 
their  mission 
is 
to  protect 
Information Technology users in the public and private 
sector organisations and the general public by providing 
up-to-date 
information 
on 
potential 
threats 
and 
vulnerabilities and by undertaking computer emergency 
response handling services. Therefore, any individual or
