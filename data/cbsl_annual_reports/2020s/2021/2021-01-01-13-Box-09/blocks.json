In order to curb the spread of the virus, the immediate response across countries was to impose varying degrees of mobility restrictions. The urgent manner in which these were undertaken necessitated the urgent transition of workers from physical places of work to \u2018work-from-home\u2019 arrangements. Neither workers nor organisations were equipped with the appropriate infrastructure for such working arrangements. This dearth was observed not only in terms of equipment, such as laptops, but also in terms of secure access to organisational systems and networks. In addition to the increased use of email and the internet, many organisations immediately adopted the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPN) for this purpose. Further, personal electronic devices were also being used for official work on a large scale within a very short period. Most of these personal devices were not secured adequately in line with industry accepted standards.",

The demarcation between official and personal tasks seems to have disintegrated as observed in the use of personal devices for official work and vice versa. Hence, this too, is a risk to cybersecurity if such devices are not maintained properly with the required security features. Users are often unaware of these risks. This puts the onus of awareness on cybersecurity and staying safe on all individuals. Organisations must focus more on creating user awareness among employees. Schools and universities should also do the same.",
