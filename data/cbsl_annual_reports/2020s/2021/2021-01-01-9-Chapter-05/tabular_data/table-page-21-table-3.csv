Government, in consultation with the Monetary Board of

scheme to attract more inward remittances to the country 
in 2020. The Government together with the cooperation 
of  other  relevant  stakeholders  has  established  a  Task 
Force to propose recommendations aiming at improving 
remittances.
Way Forward
The  importance  of  remittance  inflows  as  a  non-debt 
creating source of foreign exchange has increased in the 
face of the pandemic and calls for immediate actions to 
keep  remittances  flowing.  Promoting  financial  inclusion 
to  improve  access  to  the  banking  sector,  strengthening 
competition 
and 
could substantially reduce remittance costs and increase 
remittances  while  shifting  a  larger  share  of  remittances 
from informal to formal financial channels. Incentivising 
digital  money 
channels,  mobile  money  and  transfers  through  Fintech 
would also contribute to reduce transaction costs.
There  is  a  dire  necessity  to  find  alternative  destinations 
for migrant workers rather than relying upon the Middle 
Eastern  region,  which  is  often  subjected  to  economic 
crises driven by the swings in oil prices and geopolitical 
tensions. In this regard, exploring new labour markets and 
entering  into  bilateral  agreements  with  other  advanced 
economies,  including  Singapore,  Japan  and  European 
countries  are  imperative  to  reduce  the  exposure  of  Sri 
Lankan  foreign  remittances  being  sourced  largely  from 
one  single 
region.  Progressive  up-skilling  of  migrant 
workers through investments in competency development 
through vocational training and by providing high quality 
training on par with international standards, is beneficial in 
securing employment opportunities with higher and stable 
earnings. In addition, attention should also be drawn to 
improving
