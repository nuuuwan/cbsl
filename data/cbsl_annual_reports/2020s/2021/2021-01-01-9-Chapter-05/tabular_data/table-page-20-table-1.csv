the international demand for jobs and Sri Lanka’s supply 
insurance during economic crises or after natural disasters 
(Bettin and Zazzaro, 2016 and De et al., 2016, cited in 
World  Bank,  2019).  Remittances  have  also  become  a 
way of sharing prosperity in various aspects such as its 
living of the beneficiary households. 
Migration for foreign employment is often associated with 
social and financial costs which hinder the realisation of 
maximum benefits to the country. The foremost cost of 
labour migration is the social cost emanating from the 
impact on the wellbeing of the family members, especially 
the children who are left behind in the country. Most of 
the  time,  the  health,  nutrition  and  security  of  children 
are compromised in the families of migrant employees, 
especially  with  maternal  migration.  Moreover,  lack  of 
financial  literacy  of  some  migrant  workers  as  well  as 
their family members often leads to poor management 
of remittances for productive purposes making it difficult 
to  attain  the  expected  improvement  in  the  standard 
of 
living  of 
their  households. 
remittances  are  spent  on  consumption  of  alcohol  or 
are  more  prominent  in  the  families  of  women  who 
migrate for housemaid jobs.
Barriers to Enhance Remittances and Policy 
Prescriptions
Apart  from  social  issues,  several  other  factors  act  as 
impediments 
to 
migrant  employees  and 
In  terms  of  the  skills  profile  of  migrant  employees,  Sri 
Lanka  is  heavily  dependent  on  housemaids.  However, 
the  housemaids  category,  which  accounted 
largest share of annual migrations of over 50 per cent 
two  decades  ago,  has  declined  drastically  to  a  share 
of  below  30  per  cent  by  2020.  In  contrast,  the  share 
of 
labour  migration  under  professional  and  skilled 
employee  categories  combined  has  almost  doubled 
from 21 per cent to 37 per cent during the same period. 
Even though an upward trend in skilled labour migration 
can be witnessed, there exists a large mismatch between","ability  to  reduce  poverty  and  improve  the  standard  of","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
