5.1 OverviewS

ri Lanka’s external sector suffered a major setback in 2020 with the outbreak of the COVID-19

pandemic, requiring swift policy measures by the Government and the Central Bank.

Merchandise exports declined sharply in the months in which the spread of the virus and the

resultant containment measures were more intense, but reached close to the pre-pandemic levels

sooner than expected. In response to the policy measures taken by the Government to restrict most

non-essential imports and low crude oil prices, merchandise imports reported a significant decline

in 2020. The combined effect of the gradual recovery in earnings from merchandise exports and the

continuous decline in expenditure on merchandise imports resulted in the trade deficit to contract

notably to record the lowest trade deficit since 2010. The tourism sector was incapacitated by the

global isolation measures and the closure of borders of the country for tourists since mid March 2020.

However, Sri Lanka opened its borders to tourists from January 2021 as one of the few countries in

Asia that opened borders for tourism following pandemic related disruptions. A notable increase in

growth of the computer services sector was observed in 2020 with the environment created by the

new normal, though other inflows to the services sector, particularly sea and air freight services,

moderated. Workers’ remittances rebounded quicker than expected from a fall recorded during the

early months of the pandemic to record an overall increase during the year. Outflows from the primary

income account moderated in 2020 with lower interest and coupon payments on foreign holdings of

government securities as well as moderated payments in terms of dividends and reinvested earnings

from direct investment enterprises (DIEs). These developments led the external current account

deficit in 2020 to contract notably to US dollars 1.1 billion, accounting for 1.3 per cent of GDP. With

heightened uncertainties, limited foreign direct

investments (FDIs) were observed in 2020 and

these relatively small FDI inflows were mainly on

account of ongoing projects. Meanwhile, outflows

were recorded from the government securities

market and the Colombo Stock Exchange

(CSE), induced by the pandemic driven turmoil

in global financial markets. The exchange rate

depreciated but remained relatively stable in

2020 despite intermittent volatilities observed

in March and April and since end November.

The Central Bank actively intervened in the

domestic foreign exchange market by supplying

foreign exchange and engaging in interbank

sell-buy swap arrangements during periods of

volatility. However, on a net basis, the Central

Bank was able to absorb foreign exchange from

the domestic foreign exchange market in 2020.

Despite the obstacles to access the international

financial markets for foreign borrowings, Sri

Lanka maintained its unblemished record of debt

servicing. Nevertheless, the large debt service

payments falling due each year for the next

few years remains a challenge. Realising this

challenge and aiming to ensure the continuous

stability of the external sector and to gradually

reduce the country’s external debt burden, a target

driven programme to strengthen the domestic

economy by enhancing non-debt creating foreign

exchange inflows is being implemented in

coordination with the public and private sectors,

as the major policy initiative of the Government

in strengthening the external sector. It is also

expected that the planned fiscal consolidation

in line with the Government’s policy agenda will

dampen the spillover effects of excessive fiscal

expansion on the balance of payments (BOP),

thereby enhancing external sector stability in the

period ahead.

5.2 Current Account Balance

The current account deficit narrowed notably

in 2020, supported by the significantly reduced

trade deficit, increased workers’ remittances and

relatively low primary income deficit, despite

the notable reduction reported in the surplus of

the services account. The trade deficit declined by

around US dollars 2.0 billion in 2020, mainly due to

reduced import expenditure following the restrictions

imposed on the importation of non-essential goods

as well as the eased crude oil prices. The surplus in

the services account declined sharply as a result of

the downturn in the tourism industry and disruptions

to air and sea freight transport services, despite the

increased inflows observed on account of information

technology led business process outsourcing (IT/

BPO) related services. The deficit in the primary

income account contracted with the decline in

interest and coupon payments on foreign investment

in government securities and payments related to

dividends and reinvested earnings of DIEs. Inflows to

the secondary income account increased, with higher

than expected workers’ remittances, particularly in

the second half of 2020. These developments led the

external current account deficit to narrow to US dollars

1.1 billion in 2020, from US dollars 1.8 billion in 2019.

As a percentage of GDP, the current account deficit

was at 1.3 per cent in 2020, compared to 2.2 per cent

in 2019.

result of export earnings reaching the pre-pandemic

levels sooner than expected following the COVID-19

pandemic-related setbacks, and import expenditure

declining in response to the policy measures

introduced to curtail non-essential imports along

with relatively low global oil prices. As a result, the

smallest trade deficit since 2010 was recorded in

2020. As a percentage of GDP, the trade deficit

declined to 7.4 per cent in 2020, from 9.5 per cent

in 2019.

Export and Import Performance, Terms of Trade and Direction of Trade

Export Performance

Earnings from merchandise exports were

severely impacted during the months in which

containment measures were more intense with

the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, but

recovered towards the pre-pandemic levels

faster than expected. Lockdowns and other public

health restrictions enforced in Sri Lanka to combat

the spread of COVID-19 negatively affected

the production of exportable goods in 2020.

Meanwhile, subdued external demand, disruptions

to shipping and supply chains, issues in importing

necessary inputs due to lockdown measures in

foreign countries and adverse price movements

also affected the overall export performance during

the year. As a result, earnings from exports fell

to US dollars 10,047 million in 2020, a 15.9 per

cent decline compared to 2019. As a percentage

of GDP, export earnings in 2020 declined to 12.4

per cent from 14.2 per cent in 2019. The largest

year-on-year declines in exports were recorded

in the months of March, April and May 2020,

while considerable reductions were also recorded

in June, October and November 2020 when

COVID-19 related health restrictions were more

intense. In July and September, export earnings

were higher than the corresponding months in

the previous year with a notable increase in the

export of personal protective equipment (PPE).

Compared to 2019, most of the industrial goods

registered a decline in exports, while agricultural

exports showed a mixed performance with notable

increases in some products.

Industrial exports registered a broad-based

decline in earnings, with an overall reduction

of 18.6 per cent in 2020 compared to 2019. The

export of textiles and garments, the single largest

export of Sri Lanka, registered a decline in earnings

of 21.0 per cent in 2020. Earnings from petroleum

product exports declined due to a reduction in

quantities supplied and prices in relation to bunker

and aviation fuel. Disruption to maritime and

aviation activities across the world contributed to

this decline. However, the food, beverages and

tobacco category recorded an increase in earnings

mainly due to the export of value-added coconut

products. Further, PPE, such as textile face masks,

surgical and other gloves, and plastic clothing

articles categorised under textiles and garments,

rubber products and plastics and articles thereof,

increased during 2020. Sri Lanka’s exports of PPE

related items increased to US dollars 942 million in

2020 compared to US dollars 693 million in 2019.

Agricultural exports registered a decline in

earnings of 5.1 per cent in 2020 compared to

2019, due to weaker earnings from tea, seafood

and unmanufactured tobacco, while earnings

from spices, coconut, minor agricultural

products, rubber and vegetables increased.

Both volumes and unit values of tea exports

weakened substantially during the first wave of

the COVID-19 spread, but recovered to some

extent later in the year. Agricultural exports such

as cinnamon, pepper, dried vegetables, arecanuts,

coconut oil and fibres and natural rubber registered

increases in earnings during the year, mostly driven

by higher volumes.

Earnings from mineral exports declined

by 25.9 per cent in 2020 compared to 2019.

Earnings from mineral exports remained low and

in 2020, although importing countries use these

resources for high value-adding production

activities. Recognising this, the Government

aims to discourage the export of minerals in low

value-added form and encourage the domestic

production of goods with local minerals.

Import Performance

Expenditure on imports declined by 19.5

per cent to US dollars 16,055 million in 2020

compared to 2019, with declines in imports

of intermediate goods, investment goods and

non-food consumer goods. The overall decline

in import expenditure was a result of restrictions

imposed by the Government on the importation of

non-essential goods, low oil prices in the global

market, and the reduction in the importation of

intermediate goods due to subdued economic

activity in the country and disruptions to global

supply chains.

Expenditure on intermediate goods

declined by 20.2 per cent to US dollars 9,076

million in 2020. Expenditure on crude and

refined petroleum, the largest import item among

intermediate goods, declined to US dollars 2,325

million in 2020 from US dollars 3,677 million in

2019, mainly due to the decline in prices. Volumes

imported of crude oil and refined petroleum also

declined by 9.3 per cent and 15.0 per cent,

respectively, in the year under review. Meanwhile,

import volumes of coal increased by 8.8 per cent

in 2020, with the average price per metric tonne

declining to US dollars 83.60 from US dollars

89.79 in 2019, leading to an increase of 1.3 per

cent in the import value of coal. Import expenditure

on textiles and textile articles fell by 19.7 per cent

in 2020 compared to 2019, due to the decline

in the production volumes of garments as well

as the difficulties in sourcing textiles when the

global COVID-19 spread was acute. Among other

intermediate goods, a broad-based decline in

import expenditure was observed in 2020, though

with increased expenditure on some items, such

as wheat, fertiliser and agricultural inputs.

Expenditure on investment goods declined

by 22.6 per cent to US dollars 3,563 million

in 2020. Declines in import expenditure in all

three main categories of investment goods, i.e.,

machinery and equipment, building material and

transport equipment, were observed in 2020

compared to 2019. Import restrictions as well as

other effects of the pandemic on the global and

local economy resulted in this outcome. Although

import expenditure on almost all items under the

abovementioned categories of investment goods

declined during the year, increases were noted

in machinery and equipment parts, machinery

and mechanical appliances, turbines, agricultural

tractors, agricultural machinery and computers.

Expenditure on non-food consumer

goods registered a broad-based decline,

except medical and pharmaceutical goods

and telecommunication devices. Accordingly,

the decline in the non-food consumer goods

category was 27.0 per cent in 2020 compared to

the previous year, with the largest contribution

to the decline arising from motor vehicles for

personal use. Import restrictions imposed by the

Government on non-essential imports during the

year, together with other factors mentioned above

resulted in the decline in expenditure on most of

the non-food consumer goods.

Sri Lanka’s food and beverages import bill

stood at US dollars 1,554 million in 2020, with

an increase of 8.9 per cent over the previous

year. The three categories that recorded the

largest increase in value were; oils and fats

(due to the increase in the import of coconut oil);

sugar (mainly in the second half of the year);

and dairy products (due to the increase in import

expenditure on milk powder). Coconut oil, though

classified as a consumer good, is also used as

an intermediate good. Meanwhile, expenditure

on vegetable imports increased during the year,

mainly due to increases recorded in relation to

lentils, garlic and other onions, chickpeas and

potatoes. Expenditure on spices increased, mainly

because of expenditure on chillies, coriander

seeds, cumin, fennel seeds and vanilla, while

expenditure on turmeric and pepper declined.

Import expenditure on seafood and beverages

also declined substantially.

5cent from the 103.9 points recorded in 2019. This

improvement was a result of the import price

index falling by 8.2 index points or 9.1 per cent

(driven to a large extent by the reduction in crude

oil and refined petroleum prices, among others),

and the export price index falling by 6.4 index

points or 6.8 per cent during the year.

The overall export price index declined in

2020 due to the decline in the price index for

industrial exports, despite the improvement

in the price index for agricultural exports.

The price index of industrial exports declined by

8.6 index points or 9.4 per cent during the year,

mainly due to the decline in the price index for

petroleum exports (bunkering, aviation fuel and

other petroleum products), which was a result

of lower global oil prices in 2020 compared to

2019. In addition, price indices relating to base

metals and articles; transport equipment; wood

and paper products; leather, travel goods and

footwear; ceramic products; and animal fodder

were among the other exports that recorded a

decline during the year. A few key exports marked

modest increases in 2020, such as textiles and

apparel; gems, diamonds and jewellery; and

food, beverages and tobacco. The price index for

agricultural exports increased by 2.7 index points

or 2.5 per cent in 2020, driven by increases in the

price indices for tea, coconut, spices, seafood and

minor agricultural products. However, price indices

for unmanufactured tobacco and vegetables

decreased during the year. Meanwhile, the price

index for mineral exports increased by 8.7 index

points or 6.1 per cent in 2020.

The overall import price index declined

in 2020 with price indices for intermediate,

investment and consumer goods declining. The

import price index of intermediate goods declined by

10.1 index points or 11.1 per cent, due to declines

in prices recorded in most of the subcategories,

including fuel, fertiliser, plastic and articles thereof

and chemical products during the year. However,

the price indices of wheat and maize; diamonds,

precious stones and metals; and food preparations

increased in 2020. The price index of investment

goods declined by 8.5 index points or 10.7 per

cent in 2020 mainly due to the decline in prices

of machinery and equipment. However, the price

index of transport equipment increased. The import

price index of consumer goods declined by 2.6

index points or 2.3 per cent during the period under

review due to a decline in the price index for non-food

consumer goods, which surpassed the increase

in the food and beverages price index. Within the

non-food consumer goods category, almost all

subcategories recorded declines in price indices

in 2020 except household and furniture items and

telecommunication devices. Meanwhile, the price

index of food and beverages increased by 2.7 index

points or 3.0 per cent during the year, with most of

the indices for subcategories increasing, including

spices; sugar and confectionery; vegetables, oils

and fats; and seafood. However, the import price

index for beverages declined during the year.

The reduction in trade volumes drove down

both export earnings and import expenditure to

a considerable extent in 2020. The export volume

indices for all three main categories of exports i.e.,

industrial, agricultural and mineral exports, declined

during the year, while import volume indices for all

three main categories of imports i.e., consumer,

intermediate and investment goods, declined as

well.

Direction of Trade

Sri Lanka’s major trading partners broadly

remained unchanged from the previous year,

despite the significant decline in both exports

and imports and the disruptions caused to the

supply chains across the world during 2020. In

value terms, China surpassed India as the major

trading partner of Sri Lanka in 2020, followed by

the USA, and these three countries contributed

around 40 per cent of the total trade (both exports

and imports) of Sri Lanka. Total trade with China,

India and USA, which was at US dollars 12.6 billion

in 2019, declined to US dollars 10.5 billion during

the period under consideration driven by the impact

of the pandemic. Total trade with most of the other

top trading partners also declined during 2020,

while total trade with some smaller trading partners,

such as Oman, Kuwait and South Africa, improved.

Considering the countrywise trade balances in

2020, notable trade surpluses were recorded with

countries such as the USA (US dollars 2 billion), the

UK (US dollars 698 million), Germany (US dollars

254 million), as well as Belgium, Netherlands and

Italy. Sri Lanka recorded significant trade deficits

with Asian countries such as China (US dollars

3.4 billion), India (US dollars 2.5 billion), the UAE

(US dollars 845 million), followed by Singapore,

Malaysia and Japan. This shows the requirement

of focused measures on increasing export earnings

and reducing import expenditure from the countries

in the Asian region to improve the trade balances

with them.

The USA and European countries continued

to be major destinations for Sri Lankan exports

in 2020. The USA remained the single largest buyer

of Sri Lankan exports with more than US dollars 2.5

billion worth of exports in 2020, which accounted

for 24.9 per cent of total exports, followed by the

UK (9.0 per cent), India (6.0 per cent), Germany

(5.7 per cent) and Italy (4.5 per cent). In line with

the decline in total export earnings, exports related

to most destinations, including the top ten export

destinations of Sri Lanka, declined during 2020.

However, export earnings from several smaller

export destinations recorded marginal increases

during the year. Export earnings from the USA were

mainly on account of garments, rubber products,

made up textile articles (such as face masks),

food, beverages and tobacco, and spices. Despite

recording a decline of about US dollars 700 million

compared to 2019, the USA continued to be the

single largest garment export destination for Sri

Lanka, accounting for about 42 per cent of total

garment exports in 2020. Exports to the UK in 2020

mainly consisted of garments (about 14 per cent of

total garment exports), plastics and articles thereof

(such as plastic clothing articles), made up textile

articles, rubber products, and food, beverages

and tobacco. Exports to India included animal

fodder, spices, textiles, petroleum products, and

minor agricultural products. Meanwhile, exports to

Germany and Italy were dominated by garments,

rubber products, food, beverages and tobacco, tea,

and seafood. Exports to the EU (including the UK),

the most dominant region for Sri Lankan exports,

accounted for about 32 per cent of total exports in

2020, and consisted mainly of garments (about 44

per cent of total garment exports). Other major items

exported to the EU were rubber products, food,

beverages and tobacco, tea, plastics and articles

thereof and seafood, most of which were exported

under the EU Generalised System of Preferences

(GSP) + Scheme. In 2020, the Middle East and the

Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) led by

Russia were the main export destinations for tea,

contributing about 60 per cent of total tea exports of

the country. Taken together, the USA and the EU

accounted for about 57 per cent of the total export

earnings of Sri Lanka in 2020, reflecting the lack of

market diversity of the export sector of Sri Lanka.

Countries in the Asian region continued to

be the major sources for Sri Lankan imports

in 2020. China continued to be the main source

of imports for the second consecutive year,

recording more than US dollars 3.5 billion of

imports in 2020, with a share of about 22 per cent

of total imports. This was followed by India (19.2

per cent), the UAE (6.4 per cent), Singapore

(4.3 per cent) and Malaysia (3.8 per cent). In

line with the decline in total import expenditure

during 2020, expenditure related to most import

sources, including the top ten import sources

of Sri Lanka, recorded a decline. Expenditure

on most major import items from China, such

as textiles and textile articles, machinery and

equipment, building material, and chemical

products, declined in 2020, although expenditure

on telecommunication devices (such as mobile

phones) increased. Similarly, expenditure on

textiles and textile articles; building materials;

and machinery and equipment imports from India

declined, although expenditure on medical and

pharmaceuticals; and sugar and confectionery

increased. The major import item from the UAE,

Singapore and Malaysia was petroleum in 2020.

Other major import items from the UAE were

base metals, seafood and mineral products, while

machinery and equipment, chemical products,

plastics and articles thereof were among the

other top imported items from Singapore. Food

preparations (such as palm oil), chemical

products, machinery and equipment, building

material and oils and fats (such as coconut oil)

were the other major import items from Malaysia.

Japan, as an import source, declined to the 6th

position in 2020 from the 5th position in 2019,

mainly due to lower vehicle imports resulting

from import restrictions that were in place.

External Trade Policies, Developments and Institutional Support

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an

unprecedented disruption to the global

economy and world trade, prompting the

Government to take several measures to

mitigate its adverse effects. While taking

urgent mitigation measures, the Government

focused on a trade policy that supports

domestic producers through the development of

import alternatives and export promotion. The

Government established a Tariff Determination

Committee (TDC) in April 2020, consisting of

major stakeholders related to international trade,

mandated to design a trade and tariff policy in

line with the priorities identified in the policy

framework of the Government. The extreme

economic conditions in the first half of 2020 led

to the adoption of unprecedented measures,

including import controls by the Government

and the Central Bank. Imposing restrictions

on the importation of non-essential goods as a

temporary measure helped ease the pressure on

the exchange rate and the BOP of the country to

a great extent. The reduction in expenditure on

items subject to import restrictions accounted for

about 36 per cent (approximately US dollars 1.3

billion) of the decline in overall import expenditure

during the period from April to December 2020

when compared with the corresponding period

of 2019. The Export Development Council of

Ministers meeting was chaired by His Excellency

the President in September 2020 after a lapse

of 28 years. In 2021, the Presidential Task

Force on Economic Revival and Poverty

Alleviation focused its attention on encouraging

export earnings and other non-debt inflows of

foreign exchange through a combined effort of

relevant stakeholders to align their activities in a

streamlined and targeted manner.

Several measures were taken to improve

the institutional support to the external

sector during 2020. The Export Development

Board (EDB) continued the implementation of the

National Export Strategy (NES) 2018-2022, while

paying special attention to revive export sectors

impacted by COVID-19. Meanwhile, the EDB

continued market development programmes

through online methods during the pandemic

period. The trade chambers also contributed

towards export promotion, which helped link

the public and private sector stakeholders in

policymaking and grievance handling. Formulation

and upgrade of national standards helped local

manufacturers to compete with foreign products.

Accordingly, to improve national standards to be

in line with international standards, the Sri Lanka

Standards Institution published 327 standards by

end 2020. On the implementation of the World

Trade Organisation’s (WTO) Trade Facilitation

Agreement (TFA), the Sri Lanka Customs (SLC)

streamlined its activities further. Accordingly,

the SLC is revamping the system based post

clearance audit, which allows the SLC to further

simplify customs procedures and minimise cost

of facilitation, while maintaining internal controls.

Modifications were done on the Automated

System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) system to

handle scanned images of Customs Declarations,

which became useful to continue work without

interruptions at ports during COVID-19 related

lockdowns. Meanwhile, a committee has been

appointed to analyse and advise on modernising

the SLC and a Presidential Commission of Inquiry

was appointed in February 2021 to investigate

and report on matters related to the SLC with a

view to improve processes and prevent revenue

leakages.

Sri Lanka’s exports under trade

agreements declined in 2020 in line with the

decline in overall earnings from exports.

During the period under review, interactions with

the main trading partners, namely, the EU and

the USA, under GSP schemes were expected to

pave the way for increased market opportunities.

Sri Lanka is expected to benefit from the current

EU GSP+ scheme till its validity period ends

in 2023, after Sri Lanka was reclassified as a

lower middle income country in July 2020. The

US GSP scheme expired on 31 December 2020

and is expected to be re-authorised as per the

general practice of the US Government. The

GSP scheme offered by Japan, which expired

on 31 March 2021, is currently undergoing a

review process. In addition, Sri Lanka continued

to benefit from GSP schemes offered by several

other countries, such as the Russian Federation,

Turkey, Australia, Canada, Switzerland, Norway

and New Zealand, although their contribution to

exports remained relatively low. The UK’s Global

from the EU, came into effect on 01 January 2021.

However, export of EU GSP+ eligible Sri Lankan

products to the UK will continue to enjoy duty

free access, as long as Sri Lanka continues to

benefit from duty free market access under the

EU GSP+ scheme. Under bilateral Free Trade

Agreements (FTAs), the Indo-Sri Lanka Free

Trade Agreement (ISFTA) and the Pakistan-

Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (PSFTA)

continued to benefit Sri Lanka, although exports

under these FTAs declined in 2020. However,

exports through FTAs with India and Pakistan

remained high in 2020 as a share of total exports

to these countries at 59 per cent and 71 per

cent, respectively. Meanwhile, imports under

the ISFTA and the PSFTA continued to be low

during the year, with shares of only 5.2 per cent

(US dollars 159 million) and 3.3 per cent (US

dollars 11 million) of total imports from India

and Pakistan, respectively. Under regional trade

agreements, exports under the Asia Pacific

Trade Agreement-APTA (due to higher exports

to China, South Korea and Bangladesh) and

Global System of Trade Preferences-GSTP (due

to higher cinnamon exports to Peru) improved

during 2020. However, exports under the SAARC

Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) and

the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA),

continued to remain at low levels during 2020,

requiring engagement with regional preferential

trade agreements to be further strengthened

given the importance of enhancing cooperation

among regional trade and services networks. Lack

of product diversification, ad hoc policy changes

and non-tariff barriers, such as procedural

delays, continue to hinder the full potential of

bilateral and regional trade agreements. In 2020,

the Department of Commerce (DOC) took several

steps to address the issues of the possible

misuse of FTA concessions through re-routing

of third country origin products under FTAs.

Sri Lanka’s multilateral trade engagement with

the WTO continued in 2020 although the 12th

Ministerial Conference, which was scheduled to

be held in June 2020, was postponed due to the

COVID-19 pandemic until June 2021.

Opinions of stakeholders about the

desirability of FTAs vary significantly,

but there is widespread recognition that

conditions therein should not be harmful

to local industries and enterprises. Official

bilateral negotiation rounds on proposed

partnership agreements with China, India and

Thailand have shown little progress since 2018.

Several scheduled meetings on bilateral and

regional agreements were postponed during 2020

due to the disruptions caused by the pandemic,

while some meetings were held virtually. In

addition, in response to concerns raised by

several stakeholders over the Singapore-Sri

Lanka Free Trade Agreement (SSLFTA), a review

process was carried out during 2018/19, through

which recommendations for amendments to the

existing FTA, had been provided. Accordingly,

as per approval granted by the Cabinet of

Ministers in January 2021, a technical support

committee was formulated to carry out proposed

amendments and to conduct negotiations with

Singapore. Meanwhile, varied views have been

expressed by stakeholders on the potential costs

and benefits of comprehensive agreements with

major trading partners of Sri Lanka, including India

and China. Such views highlight the requirement

of consulting all relevant stakeholders and arrive

at a broad consensus in national interest, prior

to commencing negotiations with the foreign

counterparts, in order to reap desired benefits

to Sri Lanka through trade negotiations. Such

consensus should be embodied in the national

trade policy of the country that is being formulated,

in order to drive future actions on FTAs.

5.2.2 Services Account

The surplus in the services account

recorded a notable decline in 2020 owing to

the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The

surplus in the services account reduced by US

dollars 2.0 billion in 2020 with the shrinkage in

earnings from tourism and transport services.

Travel and Tourism

Earnings from tourism recorded a sharp

decline in 2020, with the suspension of all

passenger flights and ship arrivals from

18 March 2020 together with the issuance of

tourist visas. During the year, the total number

of tourist arrivals was limited to 507,704, which

comprised 507,311 tourists that arrived during

the first three months of 2020, and a group of

393 tourists from Ukraine, who arrived under a

pilot project based on the ‘bio bubbles’ concept

in December 2020. Accordingly, tourist arrivals

recorded a decline of 73.5 per cent compared to

the previous year. Earnings from tourism in 2020,

which are estimated based on tourist arrivals,

recorded a decline of 81.1 per cent to US dollars

682 million.

Several measures were taken by the

Government and the Central Bank to support

the stakeholders in the tourism sector who

were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic,

including measures to extend relief granted

following the Easter Sunday attacks in 2019.

The debt moratoria granted by Licensed Banks,

Licensed Finance Companies and Specialised

Leasing Companies at the request of the Central

Bank on account of the Easter Sunday attacks,

which were initially effective until 31 March 2020,

were extended until 31 March 2021 in view of the

adverse effects on the sector from the pandemic.

These moratoria were extended again by another

six months from 01 April 2021. Moratoria on

lease rentals of tourism related vehicles were

also provided and extended in tandem with the

debt moratoria. Furthermore, businesses and

individuals involved in the sector were able to avail

loans under the 4.00 per cent Saubagya COVID-19

Renaissance Facility implemented by the Central

Bank, which helped a range of tourism sector entities

to manage their liquidity, solvency and maintain

employment opportunities. The Government also

provided a host of relief measures to various

parties involved in the sector. The Government

allowed the tourism sector to operate quarantine

centres and implemented health and safety

standards and checks, which helped the tourism

sector to some extent during this period. A grace

period to pay electricity bills was provided such that

bills accrued from 01 March 2020 to 28 February

2021 can be paid on an instalment basis from

01 April 2021. Measures carried out through the

SLTDA during the year included one off payments

to tour guides and tourist drivers registered with

the SLTDA; waivers on the annual renewal fee

for the accommodation sector, travel agents, tour

guides and tourist drivers for 2020; and provisional

registration to support the informal sector within the

industry. VAT exemptions provided in December

2019 for hotels, guest houses, restaurants or other

similar businesses registered with the SLTDA, and

in April 2020 for services of inbound tours by travel

agents registered with the SLTDA, also helped the

sector.

Sri Lanka was able to open up the country

for tourists in January 2021 due to extensive

measures undertaken by the Government

together with the private sector to implement

novel methods to welcome tourists while

ensuring the safety of the local community.

Following the issuance of tourism safety protocols

by the Ministry of Tourism with the help of the

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

131

Ministry of Health and the World Health Organisation

(WHO), Sri Lanka was able to obtain the “Safe

Travel Stamp” from the World Travel and Tourism

Council in August 2020. An independent auditing

firm was appointed to conduct detailed audits for

the “Safe and Secure” certification, which includes

a QR code allowing tourists to provide feedback

on health and safety protocols followed by hotels.

The costs related to such audits are borne by the

SLTDA. Supporting this initiative, the first “Sri

Lanka Tourism Travel App Mobile Version 0” is

being developed with the support of the Information

and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA),

and the United Nations Development Programme

(UNDP). This application, which will share some

links with the Electronic and Travel Authorisation

(ETA) web portal of the Department of Immigration

and Emigration, will be used to provide travel

information for tourists while maintaining

information on adherence to health protocols. In this

background, the Government piloted a programme

to welcome tourists under the ‘bio bubble’ concept

in December 2020. Under this concept, tourists

must stay in approved hotels and visit tourist sites

on approved days and times in regulated transport.

Thus, contact with the local community is curtailed,

while tourists do not have to undergo conventional

quarantine requirements of staying in one building/

place for 14 days. Apart from the 393 tourists who

visited Sri Lanka under the pilot programme for bio

bubbles in 2020, a further 9,629 tourists visited Sri

Lanka under bio bubbles in the first three months

of 2021. Meanwhile, the SLTDA granted approval

for 29 projects worth US dollars 118 million during

2020, which are mainly related to the construction

of tourism facilities. Further, efforts were made to

develop lesser known attractions with the support

of respective Provincial Councils, and to expand

and develop existing tourist destinations and

attractions. The ‘national sustainable destination

certification’ was initiated with the destinations

proposed by Provincial Councils for all nine

Provinces. With these planned tourism revival

strategies adopted by Sri Lankan authorities

together with the private sector, earnings from

tourism are expected to gradually normalise in

2021, and pick up substantially thereafter as the

vaccination programmes worldwide subside the

pandemic fear.

Transport, Telecommunications, Computer and Information Services and Other Services

In 2020, computer and information services

subsector was a key contributor to earnings

from services, while earnings from the

transport sector declined substantially with

the disruptions to global logistical networks.

With IT/BPO services increasing notably in 2020,

particularly after the initial pandemic period, the

computer services subsector recorded higher

inflows during the year. There was a notable

decline in container handling as well as some

moderation in transshipment carried out in the

Colombo and Hambantota Ports, due to supply

chain disruptions and restrictions on non-essential

imports, especially motor vehicles. In line with the

cessation of tourist arrivals with the pandemic,

there was a substantial reduction in earnings

from air passenger services. Passenger services

outflows also reduced due to limited operations

of non-resident airlines due to the pandemic.

Most of the other subsectors, including insurance,

financial services, construction services and other

business services recorded declines in both inflows

and outflows in 2020 due to low economic activity

globally. With these developments, the surplus in

the services account contracted substantially to US

dollars 819 million in 2020, compared to US dollars

2,849 million in 2019.

5.2.3 Primary Income

The deficit in the primary income account,

which has continuously increased over the

past decade, recorded a notable contraction in

2020. This contraction was mainly a result of the

significant decline in interest and coupon payments

on foreign investment in government securities and

the reduction in dividend payments and reinvested

earnings of DIEs. There was a notable reduction in

coupon and interest payments as the outstanding

amount of Treasury bills and Treasury bonds owned

by non-residents declined drastically during the

year. With the significant increase in the purchases

of ISBs in the secondary market by resident banks

and other financial institutions, during the year, the

coupon payments on ISBs paid to non-residents

in 2020 increased only marginally compared to

the previous year. Further, interest payments on

foreign loans of the Government, increased with

the increase in outstanding foreign loans of the

Government during the year, whereas interest

payments on foreign loans by the private sector,

state owned business enterprises and Board of

Investment (BOI) companies declined during the

year. The combined effect of these developments

resulted in an overall decrease in interest payments

on foreign loans in 2020 compared to the previous

year. A notable reduction in reinvested earnings

and dividend payments of DIEs also contributed to

the contraction in the deficit in the primary income

account. FDIs in the form of reinvested earnings,

which are considered as outflows from the primary

income account, declined in 2020, in line with the

general reduction in FDIs observed during the

year. Due to subdued economic activity, DIEs

declared lower dividends compared to the previous

year, contributing favourably to the reduction in

the primary account deficit. It is envisaged that the

deficit in the primary income account would contract

further in the period ahead, with the emphasis of

the Government to further limit the dependence on

external debt in the medium term. Meanwhile, in

terms of inflows to the primary income account, the

return on investment of reserve assets decreased

in 2020, with the decline in gross official reserves

during the year.

5.2.4 Secondary Income

The secondary income account strengthened

in 2020 with a healthy growth in workers’

remittances. Although a growth was recorded

during the first two months of 2020 compared to

the previous year, remittances declined during the

period from March to May 2020 with the return of

migrant workers from countries affected by the

COVID-19 pandemic, job terminations of some

workers abroad as well as the cessation of new

departures for employment. However, workers’

remittances increased continuously thereafter to

record a 5.8 per cent growth in 2020 compared

to a decline of 4.3 per cent in 2019. This growth

may be attributed to the increased stay period of

migrant workers as a result of the closure of most

international borders, increased use of formal

channels, and a possible increase in the amount

remitted by migrant workers to families in Sri

Lanka to manage the pandemic driven hardships.

Meanwhile, personal transfers and related

Workers’ remittances have been the largest single source of foreign exchange inflow in Sri Lanka’s balance of payments (BOP) over the past decade. Contrary to the global expectation of a possible slowdown in workers’ remittances in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, Sri Lanka and a few other countries in South Asia stood out as exceptions, recording healthy remittance flows in 2020, demonstrating a sharp recovery from a dip recorded during the first half of the year. In this backdrop, it is imperative to recognise the importance of workers’ remittances as a non-debt creating external financing source and the socio-economic challenges related to labour migration that need to be resolved in enhancing remittances to be a sustainable foreign exchange inflow to the country. Accordingly, this article discusses the historical trends and economic benefits of workers’ remittances as well as social considerations related to labour migration while highlighting the challenges in enhancing remittances and measures to improve remittances.

Historical Trends in Workers’ Remittances

Workers’ remittances have long been a cushion against the current account shortfall, which emanated from the deficits in the trade and primary income accounts. Workers’ remittances constitute almost 100 per cent of the inflows to the secondary income account of the external current account. Over the past two decades, annual remittances have represented nearly one fourth of the total credits to the external current account, on average, and exceptionally, this share exceeded more than one third (35 per cent) in 2020, reiterating the significance of remittances in mitigating external sector vulnerabilities and in maintaining macroeconomic stability. Being a major source of financing the trade deficit, workers’ remittances have covered around 80 per cent of the annual trade deficit on average over the past two decades and remittance inflow has exceeded the trade deficit in 2020 accounting for around 118 per cent of the trade deficit. In 2020, the increase in workers’ remittances helped abate the impact of the sharp decline in tourist earnings.

BOX 4Workers’ Remittances: Trends, Issues and Way Forward

Workers’ remittances as a percentage of GDP, which averaged around 5.7 per cent during 1981-2000 period, increased to around 8.0 per cent of GDP during the period from 2001-2020, reflecting the increased importance of workers’ remittances in relation to Sri Lanka’s GDP. Nevertheless, remittances have shown a declining trend during the past six years, except for 2016 and 2020. In the second half of 2020, workers’ remittances increased significantly and recorded the highest monthly remittances in the history in December 2020. Accordingly, during 2020, workers’ remittances increased by 5.8 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 7.1 billion. Sri Lanka’s regional peers, i.e. Bangladesh and Pakistan have also started to demonstrate a partial recovery in remittances since the third quarter of 2020.

In the global context, several Asian countries take the lead as top remittance recipients. While India is the highest remittance recipient in the world with US dollars 83 billion recorded in 2019, China, Philippines, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Vietnam are also amongst the top ten nations receiving remittances (World Bank, 2019). Although Sri Lanka is behind its regional peers in South and South East Asia in terms of nominal inward remittances, Sri Lanka’s performance of workers’ remittances in relation to GDP places it amongst the top five remittance recipients in the two regions.

Economic Benefits of Workers’ Remittances and Social Considerations Related to Labour Migration

Workers’ remittances deliver clearly visible and tangible benefits particularly to low- and middle-income countries like Sri Lanka. Remittances augment the recipients’ incomes and generate positive multiplier effects while increasing their country’s foreign exchange reserves (Ratha and Maimbo, 2005). Further, in contrast to capital flows which tend to be cyclical, remittances are relatively stable and often consumption smoothing, acting as an

insurance during economic crises or after natural disasters (Bettin and Zazzaro, 2016 and De et al., 2016, cited in World Bank, 2019). Remittances have also become a way of sharing prosperity in various aspects such as its ability to reduce poverty and improve the standard of living of the beneficiary households.

Migration for foreign employment is often associated with social and financial costs which hinder the realisation of maximum benefits to the country. The foremost cost of labour migration is the social cost emanating from the impact on the wellbeing of the family members, especially the children who are left behind in the country. Most of the time, the health, nutrition and security of children are compromised in the families of migrant employees, especially with maternal migration. Moreover, lack of financial literacy of some migrant workers as well as their family members often leads to poor management of remittances for productive purposes making it difficult to attain the expected improvement in the standard of living of their households. In some households, remittances are spent on consumption of alcohol or drugs by the family members rather than on education of the children or for investment purposes. These issues are more prominent in the families of women who migrate for housemaid jobs.

Barriers to Enhance Remittances and Policy Prescriptions

Apart from social issues, several other factors act as impediments to improving the earning capacity of migrant employees and thus affecting remittances. In terms of the skills profile of migrant employees, Sri Lanka is heavily dependent on housemaids. However, the housemaids category, which accounted for the largest share of annual migrations of over 50 per cent two decades ago, has declined drastically to a share of below 30 per cent by 2020. In contrast, the share of labour migration under professional and skilled employee categories combined has almost doubled from 21 per cent to 37 per cent during the same period. Even though an upward trend in skilled labour migration can be witnessed, there exists a large mismatch between

the international demand for jobs and Sri Lanka’s supply capabilities. A higher demand is generated in advanced economies for specialised services such as nursing and elderly care with the changes in demographics including population ageing and increased female labour force participation rates. These jobs have a relatively high earning potential than in the case of housemaids. However, Sri Lanka has limited training institutions with international accreditation, recognised by foreign employers, to provide job-oriented training to bridge the skills gap and increase the readiness of Sri Lankan migrant employees to international markets.

Despite being a relatively stable source of foreign exchange, workers’ remittances to Sri Lanka are highly vulnerable to economic and political volatilities in source countries due to over reliance on the Middle Eastern region as a destination for labour migration. The Middle Eastern region remains the primary market for Sri Lankan migrant workers, accounting for 80-90 per cent of annual departures for foreign employment from the country and more than half of the total remittance receipts. As such, the declining trend in remittances observed since 2015 may be partly attributed to the fall in the income of oil exporting countries in the Middle East. Unavailability of social security programmes for migrant employees also discourages employees from searching for employment opportunities abroad. Moreover, COVID-19 has also adversely impacted migrant workers as some employers have terminated employment of migrant workers during the first round of the pandemic. These workers faced many hardships due to COVID-19 related travel restrictions. Sri Lanka currently does not operate any contributory job loss insurance scheme for migrants that would ensure a minimum income to migrant workers even if they lose employment due to various factors, including a pandemic or a retirement benefit scheme that would ensure a continuous income stream for these workers in the latter stages of their lives.

High remittance costs are one of the major concerns of migrant employees across the globe. The 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set forth by the United Nations also include a target for reducing

remittance costs to 3 per cent by 2030 to achieve the SDG of reducing inequality within and among countries. However, remittance costs still remain higher than the target where globally, sending remittances costs an average of 6.51 per cent and South Asia remains the lowest cost receiving region, with an average cost of 4.88 per cent (World Bank, 2020).

In view of enhancing remittance inflows to the country by overcoming the existing challenges related to foreign employment, the Government introduced several policy initiatives in Budget 2021. These measures included proposals to implement an integrated programme with the participation of all stakeholders to direct skilled workers for foreign employment and diversify the foreign employment market, establishing a contributory pension scheme for migrant employees and to pay Rs. 2 per dollar above the normal exchange rate for the foreign exchange remittances converted at licensed banks. Further, the Government, in consultation with the Monetary Board of the Central Bank, introduced a Special Deposit Account scheme to attract more inward remittances to the country in 2020. The Government together with the cooperation of other relevant stakeholders has established a Task Force to propose recommendations aiming at improving remittances.

Way Forward

The importance of remittance inflows as a non-debt creating source of foreign exchange has increased in the face of the pandemic and calls for immediate actions to keep remittances flowing. Promoting financial inclusion to improve access to the banking sector, strengthening competition and developing financial infrastructure could substantially reduce remittance costs and increase remittances while shifting a larger share of remittances from informal to formal financial channels. Incentivising digital money transfers such as online remittance channels, mobile money and transfers through Fintech would also contribute to reduce transaction costs.

There is a dire necessity to find alternative destinations for migrant workers rather than relying upon the Middle Eastern region, which is often subjected to economic crises driven by the swings in oil prices and geopolitical tensions. In this regard, exploring new labour markets and entering into bilateral agreements with other advanced economies, including Singapore, Japan and European countries are imperative to reduce the exposure of Sri Lankan foreign remittances being sourced largely from one single region. Progressive up-skilling of migrant workers through investments in competency development through vocational training and by providing high quality training on par with international standards, is beneficial in securing employment opportunities with higher and stable earnings. In addition, attention should also be drawn to improving the language proficiency, financial literacy and cultural preparation of migrant employees at the pre-departure training programmes.

of family members of migrant employees in Sri Lanka on remittance management is also imperative to ensure the proper utilisation of remittances for the betterment of the households. Most importantly, continuous monitoring systems and other measures to support families left behind, such as childcare and education support for children are required at the grass root level. With the support of other relevant authorities, the regional offices of Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment could help establish a continuous monitoring programme and provide counselling services for family members of migrant employees.

The economic crisis that originated from the pandemic has exposed significant data gaps that restricted real time monitoring of remittance flows as well as movements of migrants. Hence, there is a pressing need to improve the data collection systems on remittances. In this regard, the Central Bank is in the process of implementing an International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS), which is a comprehensive cross border and foreign currency transactions monitoring system that will be executed through licensed banks. This will help improve BOP statistics including but not limited to a wide range of data on workers’ remittances while also supporting to reconcile any statistical discrepancies. The ITRS will provide disaggregated workers’ remittances data based on the country of origin, currency, remittance receiving districts, demographics of remitters and recipient banks which will enable to better estimate the distribution of remittances and identify emerging trends that would be of use in devising policies to enhance remittances.

The Government envisions achieving a robust economic growth while enhancing non-debt sources of foreign exchange earnings and inflows to fill the resource gap of the country. In this regard, workers’ remittances play a vital role by contributing to offset BOP deficits, improved liquidity conditions in the domestic foreign exchange market, augment the international reserve levels and thereby improve the country’s credit worthiness, poverty reduction and promotion of savings and investments. In order to maximise the positive effects of remittances on economic growth and development, the role of the Government and the policy makers should be focused on making remittances and labour migration cheaper, safer and more productive with the collective effort of all the relevant stakeholders.

payments by non-residents living in Sri Lanka also

declined during the year. With these developments,

net inflows to the secondary income account

increased to US dollars 6.2 billion compared to US

dollars 5.8 billion in 2019.

5.3 Capital Account Balance

Inflows to the capital account remained

broadly unchanged in 2020. Capital transfers to

the Government increased marginally, while those

to the private sector recorded a decline in 2020,

compared to the previous year. Consequently, the

capital account recorded a surplus of US dollars 28

million in 2020 compared to a surplus of US dollars

23 million in 2019.

5.4 Financial Account

In the financial account of the BOP, both net

incurrence of liabilities and net acquisition of

assets recorded a significant reduction in 2020.

Net incurrence of liabilities recorded a net reduction

of US dollars 1,566 million in 2020 compared to a

net increase of US dollars 2,974 million in 2019.

Meanwhile, net acquisition of assets recorded

decline in liabilities in 2020 was mainly due to

higher net outflows of foreign investments from

the rupee denominated government securities

market, maturity of an ISB, net outflows of foreign

investments from the CSE, lower FDI inflows,

as well as net sales of Sri Lanka’s ISBs by non-

residents in the secondary market. Notable inflows

to the financial account were the receipt of the

foreign currency term financing facility from the

China Development Bank in March 2020, and the

SAARCFINANCE swap arrangement provided

by the Reserve Bank of India in July 2020.

FDIs, including foreign loans to BOI companies,

were limited to US dollars 670 million in 2020,

in comparison to US dollars 1,189 million in

2019. The moderation in FDIs could be primarily

attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic related

uncertainties in global financial markets that led to

global FDI flows recording a significant decline in

2020. FDIs, excluding foreign loans to DIEs, also

declined in 2020. FDIs in 2020 were primarily in the

form of intercompany borrowings and reinvested

earnings from existing FDI companies, while FDIs

to new companies were negligible as a result of

the pandemic related investment uncertainties

and travel restrictions that affected foreign

investors in general. On a sector wise breakdown,

major FDIs were received by projects related

to property development, telecommunications,

textile and hotels sectors. Despite the moderation

in FDIs in 2020, the Government expects FDIs,

particularly to the Colombo port city and the

Hambantota port project, to materialise in the

near term, with the finalisation of the Colombo

port city legislative framework and the interest

shown by foreign investors in recent times.

Portfolio investments in equity, which consist of

foreign residents’ investments in the CSE other

than direct investment transactions, recorded

a net outflow of US dollars 217 million in 2020,

compared to a net outflow of US dollars 4 million

in 2019. The net outflow of US dollars 217 million

comprised net outflows of US dollars 276 million

from the secondary market and inflows of US

dollars 59 million to the primary market. Portfolio

investments in the form of ISBs recorded a

significant net outflow of US dollars 1,635 million in

2020, with the maturity of an ISB in October 2020

and net sales made by non-residents to residents

from secondary market transactions related to

ISBs as per the data collected from a new survey

conducted by the Central Bank. Meanwhile, the

changing landscape of global capital flows as

a result of the COVID-19 pandemic caused a

sizeable net outflow of US dollars 553 million from

the rupee denominated government securities

market during the year. Meanwhile, currency and

deposit liabilities of deposit taking corporations

declined. However, the currency and deposit

liabilities of the Central Bank increased due to the

receipt of the SAARCFINANCE swap arrangement

of US dollars 400 million in July 2020, which matured

in February 2021. Net loans obtained by deposit

taking corporations recorded an increase in 2020.

Further, a net foreign loan inflow to the Government

was recorded in 2020 with the receipt of the foreign

currency term financing facility of US dollars 500

million from the China Development Bank in March

2020. Foreign liabilities of the Government in the

form of ISBs, Treasury bills, and Treasury bonds,

recording net outflows during the year demonstrated

constraints faced by the Government in terms of

foreign financing. The net incurrence of liabilities

of trade credit and advances increased in 2020.

Further, other accounts payable, mainly consisting

of Asian Clearing Union (ACU) liabilities managed

by the Central Bank, recorded a decline in 2020.

The net acquisition of financial assets

declined in 2020, primarily driven by the decline

in gross official reserves. The net acquisition of

financial assets declined by US dollars 1,825 million

in 2020 compared to an increase of US dollars 514

million in 2019. The decline in financial assets was

mainly due to the significant decline in gross official

reserves by US dollars 1,704 million in 2020, with

sizeable foreign debt service payments made on

behalf of the Government during the period amidst

moderate foreign financing to the Government.

Reserve related transactions during the year were

characterised by a notable strategic reduction in

monetary gold assets by the Central Bank. Currency

and deposit assets of the banking sector also

recorded an increase in 2020. Meanwhile, the net

acquisition of assets on trade credit and advances,

which represents trade credit and advances given

by Sri Lankan exporters to their overseas trading

partners, also recorded a decline during the year.

Other accounts receivable of Licensed Commercial

Banks (LCBs) recorded a marginal net increase

during the year.

5.5 Overall Balance

The overall balance, which is equal to the

change in net international reserves, recorded

a deficit in 2020 following the surplus recorded

in 2019. The moderation of inflows to the financial

account during the year and the significant external

debt service payments resulted in a notable

reduction in gross official reserves during the year.

Net international reserves also recorded a notable

decline, resulting in the overall balance recording a

deficit of US dollars 2,328 million in 2020.

5.6 International Investment Position

Sri Lanka’s net International Investment

Position (IIP), which is the difference between

the total external asset and liability positions

held with non-residents, improved in 2020.

Accordingly, the IIP improved from a net liability

position of US dollars 51.2 billion at end 2019 to a

net liability position of US dollars 47.9 billion at end

2020. This was as a result of a notable reduction in

the country’s external liability position to US dollars

58.8 billion as at end 2020 from US dollars 64.1

billion as at end 2019, while the country’s external

asset position declined to US dollars 10.9 billion as

at end 2020 from US dollars 13.0 billion as at end

2019.

Sri Lanka’s external asset position with

non-residents recorded a significant decline

during 2020. The stock position of external assets

decreased primarily due to the decline in gross

official reserves to US dollars 5.7 billion at end

2020 from US dollars 7.6 billion at end 2019.1

Total international reserves, which comprise gross

official reserves and foreign assets of the banking

sector, also decreased in 2020, primarily due to the

decrease in gross official reserves, while holdings of

commercial bank foreign assets recorded a modest

increase. Meanwhile, the direct investment asset

position that represents direct investments abroad

by Sri Lankan residents increased marginally during

the year. The asset position in the form of currency

and deposits and other accounts receivable of

deposit taking corporations also increased in 2020,

resulting in an increase in the foreign asset position

of the banking sector during 2020. Meanwhile,

the outstanding asset position of trade credit and

advances at end 2020, which reflects the trade

credit and advances given to non-residents by

deposit taking corporations and the private sector,

decreased from the position observed at end 2019.

Sri Lanka’s total liability position to non-

residents, as reflected in the IIP, recorded a

significant decline by end 2020, mainly due to the

valuation reduction in Sri Lanka’s ISBs as well

as a reclassification of a part of Sri Lanka’s ISB

holdings as resident holdings. The total liability

position declined to US dollars 58.8 billion as at end

2020, compared to US dollars 64.1 billion recorded

as at end 2019. This decline is mainly attributable

to the significant decline in portfolio investment

liability position due to the decline in market prices of

outstanding Government ISBs coinciding with high

secondary market yields triggered by uncertainties

in international capital markets exaggerated by

the COVID-19 pandemic and the downgrade of

Sri Lanka’s sovereign ratings. Furthermore, based

on a new survey conducted by the Central Bank

on outstanding holding of Sri Lanka’s ISBs by

resident entities, the reclassification of part of the

country’s ISBs as domestic liabilities at end 2019

and end 2020 also contributed to the reduction

to the portfolio investment liability position at end

2020 and revised position at end 2019. In addition,

outflows of foreign investments recorded from the

rupee denominated government securities market

as well as from the CSE also contributed to the

decline in portfolio investment liability position. As

a result of these developments, the outstanding

portfolio investment liability position amounted

to US dollars 8.4 billion at end 2020 compared

to US dollars 15.9 billion at end 2019. However,

the direct investment liability position increased

to US dollars 13.8 billion at end 2020 with net

direct investment inflows during the year. Further,

the liability position of debt instruments of DIEs

increased, reflecting the increase in loans and

advances given by direct investors. The foreign

loan liability position of the IIP increased as at end

2020, contributed by modest increases in foreign

loan liabilities of the Government, the Central

Bank, deposit taking corporations and the other

sector, which consist of private sector corporations

and State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs).

Although the currency and deposits liability position

of the Central Bank increased by end 2020 with

the SAARCFINANCE swap arrangement, the total

currency and deposit liability position declined

marginally as the currency and deposit liability

position of deposit taking corporations declined

notably due to the reduction in deposit liabilities of

non-residents. Further, outstanding trade credits

received by Sri Lankan importers increased

despite a reduction in trade credits received by

the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), while

the outstanding position of other accounts payable

declined with a reduction in ACU related liabilities

of the Central Bank during 2020.

5.6.1 Reserve Asset Position

Gross official reserves declined to US

dollars 5.7 billion by end 2020, in comparison to

US dollars 7.6 billion recorded at end 2019, due

to substantial debt service payments of the

Government amidst reduced inflows. Foreign

currency debt service payments, which included

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

141

repayment of a matured ISB of US dollars 1 billion,

principal payments of foreign project loans, foreign

currency term financing facility related repayments,

Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs), Offshore

Banking Units (OBUs) related loan repayments,

and interest payments mainly accounted for

the decline in gross official reserves during the

year. Main inflows that replenished gross official

reserves during the year included the foreign

currency term financing facility of US dollars 500

million, OBU loans of US dollars 720 million, and

the SAARCFINANCE swap arrangement of US

dollars 400 million. Accordingly, the end year gross

official reserve level was equivalent to 4.2 months

of imports and 43 per cent of the country’s short

term debt and liabilities on remaining maturity

basis. Meanwhile, total international reserves,

which comprise gross official reserves and foreign

assets of the banking sector, also declined by end

2020 primarily due to the decline in gross official

reserves, while holdings of commercial bank

foreign assets recorded a modest increase. Total

foreign assets were equivalent to 6.4 months of

imports by end 2020.

5.7 External Debt and Debt Servicing

5.7.1 External Debt

Sri Lanka’s outstanding external debt

declined significantly in 2020. The external debt

stock position of the country, based on market

value of tradable debt instruments, declined

to US dollars 49.2 billion at end 2020 from US

dollars 54.8 billion at end 2019, mainly due to the

significant decline in market prices of Sri Lanka’s

outstanding ISBs, the repayment of the ISB that

matured in October 2020, the reclassification of a

portion of outstanding ISBs as domestic liabilities,

and the decline in the non-resident holding of

rupee denominated government securities. The

foreign currency term financing facility of US

dollars 1 billion obtained in 2017 was fully repaid

in 2020 with the repayment of the final instalment

of US dollars 333 million in May 2020. With these

developments, the outstanding external debt of the

Government reduced substantially to US dollars

28.2 billion by end 2020 compared to US dollars

34.2 billion as at end 2019. However, it must be

noted that in spite of the reduction in the market

price of ISBs that is taken in to consideration in

arriving at this computation, the actual liability in

terms of outstanding ISBs remains higher at their

face value. Meanwhile, the outstanding external

debt of the Central Bank increased by end 2020 in

comparison to end 2019 with the SAARCFINANCE

swap arrangement of US dollars 400 million from

the Reserve Bank of India. The outstanding

external debt of the banking sector decreased

by end 2020 compared to end 2019, owing to

the significant reduction in currency and deposits

and long term foreign loans despite the increase

in short term foreign loans obtained by banks.

Also, the outstanding external debt of the private

sector and SOBEs increased in 2020 with the

increase in foreign loans, and outstanding trade

credits received by the private sector, despite a

modest reduction in foreign loans of SOBEs.

Market price of the outstanding international

bond issued by SriLankan Airlines also reduced

significantly during the period, contributing to the

reduction of the outstanding external debt liability

of the private sector and SOBEs during the year.

Further, intercompany borrowing of DIEs recorded

an increase during 2020, with a number of DIEs

receiving intercompany loans and shareholder

advances during the year.

The total outstanding external debt of the

country as a percentage of GDP recorded a

notable decline during 2020. The total outstanding

external debt as a percentage of GDP stood at

60.9 per cent by end 2020, compared to 65.3 per

cent by end 2019, as the stock of outstanding

external debt, depicted in market prices of

tradable debt instruments, declined substantially

compared to the reduction in GDP. The total

external debt with long term maturities as well as

short term maturities, when depicted in nominal

terms, declined in 2020. In line with the above

developments, the outstanding government foreign

debt, which remains the largest component of total

external debt, declined to 57.3 per cent of total

external debt by end 2020, in comparison to 62.5

per cent at end 2019. Despite these reductions

in nominal values and ratios of external debt, the

country’s external debt, particularly that of the

Government, remains significantly high compared

to peer countries. Recognising this challenging

situation, the Government has already taken a

number of steps to reduce the economy’s reliance

on foreign financing and enhance non-debt foreign

exchange inflows, while ensuring that the servicing

of outstanding loans are continued.

5.7.2 Foreign Debt Service Payments

Sri Lanka’s external debt service payments

were lower in 2020 compared to the previous

year, with lower capital repayments and a

marginal decrease in interest payments. Capital

repayments on external debt declined to US dollars

2,851 million in 2020, compared to US dollars 4,096

million in 2019 mainly with the repayment of only

one matured ISB, of which US dollars 859 million

was owed to non-residents in 2020, compared to

two ISBs amounting to US dollars 1.5 billion repaid

in 2019. Based on a recent survey of the Central

Bank on ISB holdings of the domestic commercial

banks, it has been identified that a sizeable portion

of the country’s previously paid sovereign bonds is

owned by domestic commercial banks at the time

of maturity. Accordingly, of the US dollars 1 billion

ISB settled in 2020, US dollars 859 million were paid

to non-residents upon maturity while the remaining

settlement was received by residents. However, this

information is not available for the previous year for

comparison purposes. Further, capital repayments

of foreign loans of the Government increased

during the year, which included the repayment of

foreign project loans of US dollars 1,380 million and

the repayment of the final instalment of a foreign

currency term financing facility of US dollars 333

million. Meanwhile, capital repayments of foreign

loans by the private sector, SOBEs and deposit

taking corporations declined significantly during

the year, compared to 2019, possibly due to

extensions received by private corporations

on their outstanding debt due to the pandemic

related financial difficulties. During 2020, the

Central Bank serviced the first instalment of US

dollars 14 million of the International Monetary

Fund–Extended Fund Facility (IMF-EFF) obtained

over the period 2016-2019. Meanwhile, interest

payments on external debt recorded a decline

during the year to US dollars 1,530 million, from

US dollars 1,661 million in 2019. Further, coupon

payments of ISBs issued and interest payments

on foreign loans of the Government recorded

a modest increase during the year. However,

interest payments on foreign investments in

the rupee denominated government securities

market declined during the year, with the decline

in the outstanding stock of Treasury bills and

Treasury bonds held by non-residents. Since

earnings from merchandise exports and services

were significantly lower in 2020 compared to

the previous year, total external debt service

payments as a percentage of export of goods

and services increased to 33.5 per cent in

2020 from 29.7 per cent in 2019. Further, with

the Government’s external debt representing

the majority of the country’s debt stock, the

Government’s debt service payments accounted

for 90.7 per cent of total debt service payments

in 2020.

5.8 Exchange Rate Movements

The exchange rate, which remained

relatively stable prior to the domestic spread

of the pandemic and the initial lockdown,

came under significant pressure in March –

April 2020, and during the latter part of 2020.

The Sri Lankan rupee depreciated significantly

during the period from mid-March to mid-April

2020, reaching a peak of Rs. 199.75 per US dollar

on 09 April 2020. In addition to the measures

taken by the Central Bank and the Government

to curtail non-essential imports and other outflows

from mid-March 2020, the depreciation pressure

that prevailed during this period necessitated active

intervention by the Central Bank in the domestic

foreign exchange market through supply of

foreign exchange and entering in to sell-buy swap

agreements with LCBs in view of enhancing foreign

exchange liquidity in the market. However, the

situation reversed from mid-April and the exchange

rate remained stable until November 2020. Since

end November 2020, driven by speculative market

behaviour due to Sovereign rating downgrades

and the gradual increase in imports, a build up

of pressure on the exchange rate was observed,

prompting further measures by the Central Bank.

Accordingly, the annual depreciation of the rupee

was limited to 2.6 per cent against the US dollar

at end 2020. Reflecting cross currency exchange

rate movements, the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated

against the euro (11.2 per cent), the Japanese yen

(7.5 per cent) and the pound sterling (6.2 per cent)

by end 2020, and remained unchanged against the

Indian rupee.

Other major currencies showed mixed

movements against the US dollar. Accordingly,

at the end of 2020, the euro (9.8 per cent), the

Japanese yen (5.4 per cent) and the pound sterling

(3.9 per cent) appreciated against the US dollar,

whilst the Indian rupee (2.6 per cent) depreciated.

With the combined effect of the depreciation of the

rupee against most major currencies, the Sri Lankan

rupee depreciated against the SDR by 6.4 per cent

during the year.

5.8.1 Nominal and Real Effective Exchange Rates

Effective exchange rate indices, which

measure the movement of the Sri Lankan rupee

against a basket of currencies, declined during

the year. Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER)

indices declined, reflecting the nominal depreciation

of the Sri Lankan rupee against the US dollar and

other major currencies considered in the baskets.

Accordingly, the 5-currency and the 24-currency

NEER indices declined by 5.3 per cent and 4.2

per cent, respectively. Meanwhile, the 5-currency

and the 24-currency Real Effective Exchange Rate

(REER) indices, which indicate Sri Lanka’s external

competitiveness implied by the inflation differential

between countries along with the variation in

nominal exchange rates, also dropped during the

year, by 2.4 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively.

REER indices remained well below the base year

level (2017=100), indicating the continued support

of the exchange rate to the country’s external

competitiveness.

5.8.2 Developments in the Domestic Foreign Exchange Market

The transaction volumes in the domestic

foreign exchange market declined in 2020.

Accordingly, the volume of interbank foreign

exchange transactions declined to US dollars

18,408 million in 2020, in comparison to US dollars

19,377 million in 2019. Notably, the total volume

of spot transactions declined to US dollars 10,445

million (56.7 per cent of total transactions) in

2020, in comparison to US dollars 11,643 million

in 2019. In contrast, the total volume of forward

transactions increased to US dollars 7,964 million

in 2020 from US dollars 7,734 million in 2019.

Meanwhile, the Central Bank intervened in the

domestic foreign exchange market by purchasing

US dollars 282.5 million, on a net basis, in 2020,

to build up the international reserves. This was

a result of purchases of US dollars 685.4 million

and a supply of US dollars 402.9 million.
