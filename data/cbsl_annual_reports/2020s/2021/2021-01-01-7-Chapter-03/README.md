3.1 OverviewA

mid the varied and multi-faceted challenges posed by COVID-19 in 2020, that are still continuing,

the economic and social infrastructure of the country experienced several setbacks in relation to

both service delivery and development activities. However, the strong infrastructure base of the

country served as a buffer and facilitated the continuation of economic activity, during this period of unique

challenges. Domestic transport activities, which reached an almost standstill level with the nationwide

mobility restrictions from mid-March to end-April 2020, gradually picked up thereafter, despite a few

episodes of declines due to localised lockdowns. International airports of the country remained closed for

tourist arrivals in 2020 from mid-March onwards. During the year, the performance of the ports sector

was adversely affected by the disruptions to global logistical networks and the identification of several

COVID-19 positive patients at the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. Several infrastructure development projects

progressed at a modest pace due to mobility restrictions, physical distancing, and other COVID-19 related

health regulations. While the nationwide lockdown during the second quarter of the year caused a significant

reduction in the demand for energy, it gradually returned to pre-pandemic levels thereafter. Despite the

disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the resilient growth performance of the economy was

underpinned by the consistent investment in socioeconomic infrastructure over the past several decades.

The continuity of economic activity amid several COVID-19 related restrictions was greatly facilitated by the

telecommunications sector, which proactively adapted to the challenges posed by COVID-19 and strived to

ensure seamless virtual connectivity during the lockdown period. Throughout the year, operators proactively

offered several innovative packages at competitive prices targeted at providing cost-effective data solutions

for education and work purposes, as well as ensuring social connectivity amidst the physical distancing

measures during the pandemic. Meanwhile, the proactive and efficacious service delivery of the health

sector in collaboration with numerous other stakeholders enabled the effective curbing of the spread of the

virus, low fatality rates, and the relatively rapid restoration of normalcy to economic activity. However, the

country continued to struggle with the burden of Non-Communicable Diseases and several health sector

initiatives were undertaken to ensure the continuity of medical care to affected patients despite COVID-19

related restrictions. Amidst the intermittent closure of schools and universities, educational activities

continued through digital platforms, except in a few remote areas where transmission facilities were not

available. National examinations for the academic year, although delayed, were successfully held. In light of

the disproportionately high impact of COVID-19 on low-income segments of the population, the Government

paid an allowance and provided other relief measures to vulnerable families and individuals enabling them

to meet their daily needs. However, issues relating to targeting poverty relief continued to weigh negatively

on the efficacy of these costly interventions. As observed in 2020, consistent investment in uplifting both

the quantity and quality of socioeconomic infrastructure can serve as a buffer to the macroeconomy, in

terms of resilience and continuity of economic activity, and the microeconomy, in terms of preventing any

further widening of prevalent socioeconomic disparities. Considering the changing nature and the severity of

economic shocks and volatilities, a robust infrastructure base can smoothen the resultant adverse economic

consequences and ensure that the growth process over the medium term, remains sustainable and inclusive.

3.2 Economic Infrastructure Policies, Institutional Framework and Performance

Petroleum

While the COVID-19 pandemic caused global

crude oil prices to reach unprecedentedly low

levels in March 2020, a rapid recovery in prices

was registered towards the end of the year.

The average crude oil price (Brent) declined by

32.3 per cent to US dollars 43.35 per barrel in 2020

compared to the average price of US dollars 64.04

per barrel recorded in the previous year. However,

throughout the year, crude oil prices displayed

significant volatility. Crude oil prices, which were

buoyed by geopolitical tensions at the beginning of

the year, declined sharply with the spread of the

COVID-19 pandemic. The lowest Brent crude oil

price since 2000 was recorded in mid April 2020.

The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price fell to

negative levels for the first time in history, recording

negative US dollars 37.63 per barrel in April 2020,

due to continued production despite weak demand

and lack of storage capacity. On the demand

front, the imposition of lockdowns and mobility

restrictions weighed negatively on prices whereas

in relation to supply, the Organisation of the

Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) undertook

several supply cuts throughout the year to keep

prices elevated. However, from November 2020

onwards, an upward trend in global crude oil prices

was observed with renewed economic optimism.

By the end of the year, daily crude oil prices had

risen to US dollars 51.34 per barrel. In line with

the trends in global crude oil prices, the average

price of crude oil imported by the Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation (CPC) declined to US dollars 45.57

per barrel during 2020 compared to the average

import price of US dollars 68.80 per barrel recorded

during 2019. During the first quarter of 2021, as

well, crude oil prices were volatile on a daily basis

and remained largely within the range of US dollars

60 – 70 per barrel with markets weighing in several

factors such as the deployment, supply and health

concerns regarding the COVID-19 vaccines, fresh

lockdowns amidst rising cases and new variants of

the virus, the continued push by governments for

economic recovery, OPEC’s supply cuts as well as

the brief blockage of the Suez Canal. The average

Brent crude oil price in the first quarter of 2021

stood at US dollars 61.22 per barrel.

Subsequent to the price revisions made in

September 2019, no revisions were undertaken

to domestic retail prices of key petroleum

products. Nevertheless, prices of both Furnace

Oil 800 and Furnace Oil 1,500 were reduced by

Rs. 26.00 to Rs. 70.00 per litre respectively, in 2020,

to afford some concession to the Ceylon Electricity

Board (CEB) for thermal power generation. The

concession was later extended to Independent

Power Producers (IPPs) as well. Meanwhile, the

Lanka IOC PLC (LIOC) revised domestic retail

prices three times during the first half of 2020.

In March 2020, the Fuel Price Stabilisation

Fund (FPSF) was established with a view to

ensure equitable distribution of the benefits of

the unusual decline in international oil prices

across the economy, rather than revising

domestic fuel prices. Upon establishment,

Rs. 47.5 billion of funds were raised from the

Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) through Treasury

bill issuances in March 2020. From end April 2020,

fuel surcharges were imposed on imports of petrol,

super diesel and auto diesel and funds collected

from the surcharges were channeled to the FPSF.

However, the surcharge on imports of Petrol 92

was lifted in June 2020, while the surcharges on

Petrol 95, Auto Diesel and Super Diesel were

revised downwards. Subsequently, all existing

surcharges on imports of petroleum products were

lifted in February 2021. During 2020, approximately

Rs. 69.2 billion had been accumulated in the FPSF,

including funds raised from the CBSL, of which

Rs. 48.0 billion was utilised for the partial

settlement of the dues of the CEB to the CPC and

approximately Rs. 21.0 billion was utilised for the

settlement of Treasury bills issued to the CBSL.

During the year, sales volumes of petroleum

products in the domestic market contracted by

16.8 per cent, reflecting the impact of mobility

restrictions and the slowdown in economic

activity due to the disruptions caused by

the COVID-19 outbreak, particularly in the

second quarter of the year. Accordingly, sales

volumes of the CPC and the LIOC contracted by

16.9 per cent and 15.7 per cent, respectively, during

the year. In line with the overall slowdown in sales

of petroleum products in the domestic market, the

sales volume of the CPC to the transport sector

recorded an overall decline of 13.6 per cent in

2020. Meanwhile, with the decline in the thermal

share of power generation, sales of diesel for power

generation registered a notable contraction of 61.0

per cent in 2020, while sales of furnace oil for thermal

power generation increased by around 8.9 per cent

during the period. Further, the effects of COVID-19

on activity in the industrial and aviation sectors led

to contractions in the sales of petroleum products to

these sectors during the year.

During 2020, refinery output of the CPC

recorded an overall decline of 7.7 per cent. While

overall crude oil throughput declined by 9.6 per cent,

refinery output of diesel and petrol contracted by

13.9 per cent and 11.6 per cent, respectively. The

total volume of imports of refined products by the

CPC also declined by 22.0 per cent during the year,

reflecting subdued domestic demand for fuel due to

COVID-19 related mobility restrictions.

The CPC’s financial performance improved

in 2020 as domestic prices of key petroleum

products were maintained without change,

despite the relatively low level of global oil

prices. As per unaudited provisional financial

estimates, the CPC recorded an operational profit of

Rs. 33.9 billion in 2020 compared to an operational

loss of Rs. 19.1 billion in the previous year. Sales of

petroleum products to the major sectors of transport,

power generation, aviation and industries yielded

operational profits in 2020. However, the depreciation

of the rupee against the US dollar resulted in an

exchange rate variation loss of Rs. 21.8 billion to the

CPC during the year given the large foreign currency

exposure of the CPC. This weighed negatively on

the overall profit (before taxes) of the CPC, which

stood at Rs. 2.4 billion in 2020 in comparison to

a loss of Rs. 11.8 billion recorded in the previous

year. Meanwhile, borrowings of the CPC from the

banking sector increased by Rs. 74.1 billion during

the year to Rs. 381.8 billion in 2020, while deposits

with domestic Licensed Commercial Banks reached

Rs. 63.9 billion by end 2020 compared to Rs. 30.0

billion at end 2019. The CPC’s outstanding trade

receivables from public corporations declined by

Rs. 10.5 billion to Rs. 142.7 billion in 2020 due to

the CEB’s partial settlement of liabilities during

the year. By end 2020, trade receivables from the

CEB and SriLankan Airlines accounted for around

89.2 per cent of total trade receivables of the CPC.

Infrastructure development projects in the

petroleum sector continued at a slow pace during

2020. The Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery Expansion

and Modernisation (SOREM) project, which had not

seen much progress over the past decade due to

the lack of investment, was cancelled in 2020 by the

CPC. The Cabinet of Ministers granted approval in

November 2020 for the initiation of a new feasibility

study by the CPC for the establishment of a new

refinery in Sapugaskanda under a Public-Private

Partnership (PPP) model with a capacity of 100,000

barrels per day. The feasibility study is also expected

to consider the changing fuel needs of the economy

and recent advancements in related technologies.

In an attempt to induce investor appetite for gas

exploration in Sri Lanka by the Petroleum Resources

Development Secretariat (PRDS), the regulatory

body for off-shore hydrocarbon exploration,

development and production work undertaken by

the Government, the National Policy on Natural Gas

was gazetted in October 2020.

Electricity

Total electricity generation registered a

decline of 1.3 per cent to 15,714 GWh in 2020. A

significant decline in generation was observed in the

months of March, April, and May 2020 due to reduced

electricity demand amidst lockdown measures

which were imposed to curb the COVID-19 spread.

A rebound in electricity generation was observed

in June 2020 with the removal of the nationwide

lockdown and the gradual return of the economy

to normalcy. However, a declining trend in total

generation was recorded towards the latter part of

the year owing to the second wave of the pandemic.

In terms of the generation mix, hydropower

generation increased during 2020 supported by

sufficient rainfall received in the catchment areas

leading to healthy reservoir levels. Coal power

generation also increased during 2020, since units

of the Kerawalapitiya coal power plant did not

experience any extended closures as observed in the

previous years. Further, electricity generation through

coal is cheaper than fuel oil-based power generation,

which includes the use of products such as furnace oil

and diesel. The combined effect of increased hydro

and coal power generation supported the notable

reduction in the more expensive fuel oil-based power

generation. Meanwhile, power generation through

Non-Conventional Renewable Energy (NCRE)

sources, including mini-hydro generation, registered

an increase in 2020. Overall, the CEB contributed

70.9 per cent of total power generation, while

Independent Power Producers (IPPs) accounted for

the remainder.

As per provisional estimates, electricity

sales registered a decline of 2.2 per cent to

14,287 GWh in 2020, largely due to the reduced

demand from the industrial sector that outweighed

the growth in demand from the domestic sector.

The reduction in sales was driven by the decline

in demand from the industrial, general-purpose

and hotel categories, reflecting subdued economic

activities as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Meanwhile, mobility restrictions imposed to curtail

the COVID-19 pandemic required people to stay at

home, resulting in a significant increase in sales to the

domestic sector. During the year under consideration,

sales to the domestic, government, industrial, general-

purpose and hotel sectors accounted for 35.6 per cent,

1.4 per cent, 29.1 per cent, 19.9 per cent and 1.3 per cent

of total sales, respectively. However, issues in manual

billing of electricity consumption during lockdown

periods inconvenienced both electricity consumers

and the CEB. This highlights the importance of shifting

to smart metering technology, which will allow remote

access to consumption data and enable estimation of

real-time usage. Such technology is particularly

relevant during periods of social or physical disruptions.

The financial performance of the CEB was

relatively better during 2020 in comparison to

the preceding year, due to the reduced reliance

on costly fuel oil-based generation owing to

lower demand and the favourable generation

mix. As per unaudited provisional financial data, the

CEB recorded a loss of Rs. 62.6 billion during 2020,

compared to a loss of Rs. 97.4 billion reported in

the previous year. Short term liabilities of the CEB,

primarily to the banking sector, the CPC and the

IPPs, decreased to Rs. 212.9 billion by end 2020,

from Rs. 223.8 billion at end 2019, whereas long

term outstanding liabilities of the CEB increased to

Rs. 477.1 billion by end 2020 from Rs. 433.6 billion

recorded at end 2019. The persistently weak financial

position of the CEB underscores the need to adopt

a cost reflective pricing mechanism for electricity

tariffs while augmenting the generation capacity

of economical energy sources, which will ensure

the expeditious implementation of the long-term

generation expansion plan.

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka

(PUCSL) strived to ensure effective service

provisioning to electricity consumers amidst

the pandemic in 2020. The PUCSL, together with

the CEB and Lanka Electricity Company Private

Limited (LECO), prepared a guideline stipulating

the bill calculation method on a pro-rata basis to

ensure fairness to consumers despite delays in

meter reading. Further, considering the financial

difficulties of the consumers, grace periods were

granted to pay electricity bills during the lockdown

periods. At the same time, the PUCSL encouraged

consumers to pay their bills on time to ensure the

financial viability of the CEB and the LECO. The

PUCSL launched a provincial mobile service to

address customer complaints while providing

information regarding electricity services. A

database was also established containing the

information of registered electricians and plumbers

residing in each district, so that consumers may

conveniently seek the assistance of electricians or

plumbers in the proximity of their area. Meanwhile,

as per the instructions of the PUCSL, the CEB

revised the Least Cost Long Term Generation

Expansion Plan for the period 2020-2039 with

a view to ensuring the energy security of the

country with due consideration to low cost power

generation.

Construction activities of several power

projects continued, albeit at a slower pace due

to COVID-19 related restrictions. Construction

activities of the Uma Oya hydropower project

(120 MW), the Moragolla hydropower project

(30.5 MW) and the Broadlands hydropower

project (35 MW) were under progress during the

year, achieving physical progress of 96 per cent,

26 per cent and 78 per cent, respectively, by the

end of 2020. The Mannar wind power project (100

MW) achieved 81 per cent physical progress by

the end of the year and the plant is expected to

be connected to the national grid by June 2021.

Meanwhile, during the year, 33 rural electrification

schemes were completed and 4,400 consumers

joined the Soorya Bala Sangramaya (solar power

generation) project, adding 64 MW capacity to the

national grid.

Road Development

Despite the disruptions caused by the

pandemic, particularly during the period from

mid-March to end-April, the Road Development

Authority (RDA) continued to carry out its

development activities during 2020. As at

end 2020, the total length of National Highways,

comprising class A and B roads, maintained by the

RDA measured 12,224 km approximately, while the

total length of expressways was 271.7 km. During

the year, the RDA incurred Rs. 226.1 billion for the

maintenance and development of expressways

and highways, widening and improvement of

roads, construction of bridges and flyovers, and

rehabilitation of roads affected by natural disasters.

This expenditure was 48 per cent higher than the

expenditure incurred in 2019. Accordingly, during

the year, the RDA spent Rs. 99.7 billion and

Rs. 92.6 billion on the development of expressways

and highways, respectively, while spending

Rs. 17.5 billion on the construction of bridges and

flyovers. However, the actual expenditure incurred

during the year remained below the allocation of

Rs. 249.5 billion for 2020.

Development activities targeted at

improving the expressway network in the

country continued to progress during the year.

The extension of the Southern Expressway Project

from Matara to Hambantota and the development

of an expressway link to Mattala continued during

the year. Accordingly, the expressway link that

connects Godagama, Palatuwa, Beliatta and

Barawakumbuka was opened to the public in

February 2020. Construction activities of the

expressway from Mattala to Hambantota through

Andarawewa were also completed in 2020.

Meanwhile, construction work of the Central

Expressway, which comprises two expressway

sections from Kadawatha to Meerigama and from

Meerigama to Kurunegala continued during the

year under review. Although the physical progress

attained of the Kadawatha to Meerigama section

was merely 5.4 per cent by end of 2020, the

physical progress of the Meerigama to Kurunegala

section averaged around 83 per cent for contract

packages A, B, C and D. Delays were experienced

in land acquisition activities relating to the Central

Expressway sections from Pothuhera to Galagedara

and from Kurunegala to Dambulla due to lack of

funds as well as the accumulation of outstanding

payments during the year. Although the feasibility

study of the proposed Ruwanpura expressway

was completed during the first half of 2018, it was

reassessed in 2020 for the Ingiriya to Pelmadulla

section of the Expressway, with special emphasis

on the environmental impact. Land acquisition

under Phase I of the Ruwanpura Expressway,

which covers the section from Kahathuduwa

to Ingiriya, had attained physical progress of

60 per cent by end 2020.

In light of the mobility restrictions

implemented during the year, vehicular traffic

along the expressways declined. Accordingly,

the daily average number of vehicles that travelled

on the Southern Expressway (from Kottawa to

Godagama), the Colombo Katunayake Expressway

and the Outer Circular Highway declined by

16.6 per cent, 26.4 per cent and 0.5 per cent,

respectively, during 2020. As a result, the overall

revenue generated from expressways declined by

15.5 per cent to Rs. 7.3 billion in 2020.

Amid COVID-19 related disruptions, the RDA

continued several road and bridge development

programmes during 2020. With the imposition of

lockdown measures in early 2020, several road

development projects came to a temporary halt

due to the restricted mobility of workers as well as

limitations relating to the importation of required

construction materials. Meanwhile, land acquisition

for the Baseline Road Project - Phase III was in

progress during the year and 48.6 per cent of

required land lots had been acquired by end 2020.

The environmental impact assessment of Phase

I of the Elevated Highway project was completed

in 2020 and the land acquisition and resettlement

processes were underway. The feasibility study

of Phase II of the same project, which comprises

the section from Rajagiriya to Athurugiriya was

also completed during the year. In 2020, feasibility

studies related to the construction of the flyovers

in Alawwa, Muththettugala and Slave Island were

also completed, while those for the Kochchikade

Bypass and the Marine Drive extension project

from Dehiwala to Panadura were underway.

Aligning with the National Policy Framework, a

programme to develop an alternative road system

of 100,000 km to increase access to main roads

and expressways commenced during the year.

Further, under the Central Expressway Section 2

project, road improvement activities related to two

national roads from Pasyala to Giriulla and from

Alawwa to Dampalassa commenced in 2020 to

enhance the Central Expressway connectivity.

Road Passenger Transportation

Road passenger transportation recorded a

subdued performance in terms of both public

and private sector transport operations due

to the imposition of COVID-19 related mobility

restrictions. The island-wide lockdown imposed

from mid-March to end-April resulted in a temporary

suspension of public passenger transportation.

Although public passenger transportation activities

gradually improved with the easing of mobility

restrictions from early May, transport activities

were again affected in the final quarter of 2020

due to localised lockdowns. Accordingly, the

Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) and private

bus operators registered substantial declines in

operated kilometrage and passenger kilometrage

during 2020. During the year, operated kilometrage

and passenger kilometrage of the SLTB recorded

declines of 28.4 per cent and 32.2 per cent,

respectively. Meanwhile, the average number of

buses operated by the SLTB declined from 5,048

in 2019 to 4,045 in 2020. Passenger kilometrage

and operated kilometrage of private bus operators

witnessed significant declines of 65.8 per cent and

64.9 per cent, respectively, during 2020. As at

end 2020, only 53.6 per cent of the total number

of private buses were in operation, compared to

92.9 per cent as at end 2019. Meanwhile, as at the

end of the year, 3,069 inter-provincial and 17,054

intra-provincial bus permits had been issued by the

National Transport Commission (NTC) for private

bus operations.

The transport expansion activities that were

to be implemented by the NTC experienced

significant disruptions during 2020. During the

year under review, the NTC continued to focus on

extending its special bus services, namely Sisu

Seriya, Gemi Seriya and Nisi Seriya in collaboration

with the SLTB, to provide special public transport

services amid the COVID-19 pandemic. There

were 30 new additions to the Sisu Seriya services

in early 2020. Due to disruptions in public transport

activities, only one new Gemi Seriya service was

initiated during the year, raising the total number

of Gemi Seriya services to 16 by end 2020.

During the year, 13 new Nisi Seriya bus services

were introduced to facilitate public transportation

during the night hours, thereby increasing the

total number of services to 192 by end December

2020. The expenditure incurred on the Sisu Seriya,

Gemi Seriya and Nisi Seriya services amounted to

Rs. 385.6 million, Rs. 4.2 million and Rs. 12.3

million, respectively, during 2020. Due to seating

capacity limitations introduced to transport services,

in view of the COVID-19 health regulations, private

bus operators raised concerns regarding declining

revenues. Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers

granted special approval in November 2020 for the

upward revision of bus fares for normal services by

20 per cent.

The SLTB’s financial performance was

negatively affected by the limited operation and

usage of public transport amidst the COVID-19

pandemic. According to provisional unaudited

financial statements, total revenue of the SLTB

declined by 28.2 per cent to Rs. 31.2 billion owing to

reduced passenger movements. The SLTB, which

had been operationally profitable in recent years,

reported an operating loss of Rs. 2.3 billion in 2020

compared to an operating profit of Rs. 1.6 billion

recorded in 2019. Meanwhile, subsidies granted by

the Government for the operation of uneconomical

routes and for subsidised season tickets amounted

to Rs. 10.7 billion in 2020, in comparison to

Rs. 10.9 billion recorded in 2019.

New registrations of motor vehicles declined

drastically during 2020 as a result of policy

measures taken by the Government and the

Central Bank to curtail non-essential imports,

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

85

including the importation of motor vehicles for

personal use. Accordingly, new registrations of

motor vehicles declined by 44.8 per cent in 2020.

Notable reductions in registrations were witnessed

across all vehicle categories with new registrations

of motor cars, buses and three wheelers declining

by 45.0 per cent, 64.2 per cent, and 53.8 per cent,

respectively.

Rail Transportation

The operations of the Sri Lanka Railways

(SLR) recorded a weak performance during

2020, impacted by mobility restrictions

imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19.

Accordingly, overall operated kilometrage and

passenger kilometrage of the SLR declined notably

by 28.9 per cent and 46.6 per cent, respectively,

during the year. With the removal of the nationwide

mobility restrictions from end-April 2020 onwards,

rail passenger kilometrage recovered gradually,

but remained below the average rail passenger

kilometrage recorded in the pre-pandemic period.

Although goods kilometrage recorded a significant

contraction during the period from March to May

2020, the overall decline during the year was

limited to 1.1 per cent with a recovery observed in

freight transportation in the latter part of the year.

The financial performance of the SLR

continued to weaken in 2020, reflecting the

impact of the decline in train operations

during the year. The SLR’s operating loss further

expanded to Rs. 10.1 billion in 2020, in comparison

to the operating loss of Rs. 7.6 billion in 2019. Total

revenue of the SLR declined by 42.2 per cent in

2020, largely driven by a 45.6 per cent contraction

in revenue generated from passenger transport. In

the meantime, the 35.9 per cent increase in the total

expenditure of the SLR is to be primarily attributed

to the substantial increase in capital expenditure

during the period under review. This was due to the

increase in payments made for the procurement

of rolling stocks and for the Maho-Omanthei track

rehabilitation project.

Infrastructure development and improvement

activities undertaken by the SLR to ensure

efficient passenger and freight transportation

in the country were disrupted by the COVID-19

pandemic. However, the SLR continued to carry

out several development and enhancement activities

during the period, albeit at a slower pace. During

2020, the rehabilitation of the Maho-Omanthei

railway line project continued, while double tracking

of the railway lines from Polgahawela to Kurunegala

and from Payagala South to Aluthgama commenced

during the period. Rehabilitation activities of railway

stations continued during the year with several railway

stations located in areas with tourist attractions

undergoing renovation with the financial assistance

of the Sri Lanka Tea Board. Meanwhile, with a view

to enhancing the rolling stock position, the SLR

procured ten locomotives, six normal power sets,

nine up country service-related power sets, twenty

float wagons and thirty oil tank wagons during 2020.

Advance payments were made to purchase two

air-conditioned power sets and 160 passenger

coaches from India. The project to rehabilitate 200

passenger coaches continued and 50 passenger

an extension of this project, the Cabinet of Ministers

granted approval for the rehabilitation of an additional

100 passenger carriages. With the intention of

improving the safety of railway crossings, initiatives

were underway to procure 200 protected level

crossing systems under the New Hungarian Credit

Line.

Civil Aviation

The performance of the civil aviation sector

experienced a notable setback in 2020, due to

the sharp decline in travel and tourism related

activities in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak.

The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic crippled

the global air travel industry. As per the International

Air Transport Association (IATA), international

passenger demand declined by about 76 per cent in

2020. Domestically, the continued closure of airports

from mid-March onwards till early 2021 weighed

negatively on aviation activities in the country.

Total number of aircraft movements through the

Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) showed

a notable decline of 65.4 per cent to 24,931 aircraft

movements, comprising 20,437 international aircraft

movements and 4,494 domestic aircraft movements.

Total international passenger movements at the BIA,

including transit passengers, decreased significantly

by 77.4 per cent to 2.6 million during 2020. Although

most of the airlines utilised their aircraft for cargo

operations during this period, total volume of cargo that

was moved through the BIA during the year declined

by 44.8 per cent to 136,043 MT. Further, the Mattala

Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA), which was

used as an alternative airport to handle repatriation

flights, recorded 15,482 passenger movements and

505 aircraft movements during 2020. Following the

outbreak of COVID-19, international operations

were not carried out by the Jaffna International

Airport (JIA) from mid-March to December 2020,

while four domestic flights were operated with 20

passengers onboard after resuming operations for

domestic travel in October 2020. Accordingly, total

passenger movements and aircraft movements at

the JIA were reported as 3,502 and 140, respectively,

during 2020. Further, total passenger movements in

the Ratmalana Airport and the Batticaloa Domestic

Airport declined by 14.7 per cent and 63.4 per cent,

respectively. Although the recovery in air travel

remains subdued thus far, the rapid deployment

of vaccines across the world is expected to create

a steady improvement in traveler sentiment. The

reopening of Sri Lanka’s borders in January 2021,

with ‘bio bubble’ arrangements, will enable the

country to reap the benefits of renewed interest in air

travel. Meanwhile, the BIA received the 'Certificate

of Accreditation' in January 2021 by the Airports

Council International (ACI) for its commitment to

prioritising health and safety measures in accordance

with international recommendations. This credential

is expected to boost the confidence of international

travelers and airlines and validate Sri Lanka as a safe

travel destination during this pandemic.

The COVID-19 outbreak and related lockdowns

dampened the progress of several aviation

development projects during 2020. Airport and

Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Limited (AASL) initiated

a project comprising the construction of a second

terminal at the BIA (package A) and the construction of

remote apron and taxiways (package B). Construction

work of package A commenced in November 2020

and the project is scheduled to be completed within

36 months, while package B registered a progress of

92 per cent and is scheduled to be completed within

the first half of 2021. The construction of an import

cargo terminal at the BIA with an additional annual

capacity of 150,000 MT is also underway. Meanwhile,

activities related to the Master Plan (2018-2030) to

develop the Ratmalana Airport as an ‘Exclusive

Gateway to Colombo’ was in progress during 2020.

The AASL was also engaged in the restructuring

and remodelling of the existing passenger terminal

building to extend the capacity at the BIA, and in

the development of a dedicated access road to the

BIA with a view to easing traffic congestion during

peak hours. In collaboration with other Government

institutions, the AASL also undertook several

health and safety measures in light of COVID-19.

This included the issuance of Standard Operating

Procedures to passengers and airlines, installation

of a PCR laboratory and thermal scanners within the

BIA premises and facilitating special flights for the

repatriation of migrant workers.

Travel restrictions associated with the

COVID-19 pandemic weighed negatively on the

performance of SriLankan Airlines (SLA). As per

provisional financial statements, SLA incurred an

operating loss of Rs. 30.9 billion in the period from

April 2020 to January 2021, in comparison to the

Rs. 13.9 billion loss recorded during the period

from April 2019 to January 2020, which also

included the impact of the Easter Sunday attacks.

During the period under review, revenue of SLA

registered a notable decline of 75.9 per cent, while

operating expenditure declined by 58.4 per cent.

SLA initiated cost-cutting measures including aircraft

lease contract renegotiation, employee related cost

reduction, renegotiation of contractual obligations

and suspension of non-essential service contracts

and renegotiation of fuel prices, with a view to

mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on

the financial performance of SLA. During 2020, the

airline continued to engage in the repatriation of Sri

Lankan nationals dispersed globally, while some

charter operations were also carried out to meet new

requirements. Accordingly, 39,583 passengers were

repatriated through 159 flights from 01 April 2020 to

10 January 2021. Cargo operations of SLA were also

expanded in view of facilitating export activities, and

the current cargo network comprises 18 destinations.

disruptions in supply chains, it rebounded to

some extent by the end of the year. Despite the

positive growth momentum observed at the beginning

of 2020, the negative impact of the pandemic was

evident in port activities during March and throughout

the second quarter of 2020. However, a turnaround

in the performance of port activities was observed

in the third quarter, where both container and cargo

handling activities recorded positive performance

with the easing of mobility restrictions. Meanwhile,

the outbreak of the second wave of the pandemic

in early October weighed negatively on port sector

activities during the final quarter of the year, largely

due to a number of COVID-19 cases being reported

among staff of the Port of Colombo. As a combination

of these factors, both container handling and cargo

handling activities at the Port of Colombo witnessed

year-on-year contractions in 2020, along with a

decline in ship arrivals. Container handling, including

transshipment handling, declined in all terminals

of the Port of Colombo. The Colombo International

Container Terminal (CICT), Sri Lanka Ports Authority

(SLPA), and South Asia Gateway Terminal (SAGT)

accounted for 42.1 per cent, 30.6 per cent, and

27.3 per cent, respectively, of the total volume of

containers handled at the Port of Colombo. Although

SLPA and SAGT registered declines in volumes of

cargo handling, CICT recorded a marginal growth

of 0.6 per cent in the same. The operations of the

first quay wall of the East Container Terminal (ECT)

commenced in October 2020 and 41,741 Twenty-foot

Equivalent Container Units (TEUs) were handled by

the ECT by end December 2020.

Although vehicle handling declined notably

at the Port of Hambantota during 2020, cargo

handling registered a significant expansion with

the diversion of some vessels from the Port

of Colombo to the Hambantota Port with the

outbreak of COVID-19 at the Port of Colombo. The

total number of vehicles handled at the Hambantota

Port declined by 14.3 per cent to 352,917, especially

due to the 51.8 per cent decline in domestic vehicle

handling to 16,896 vehicles. Policy measures taken

by the Government to curtail motor vehicle imports

contributed to the slowdown in vehicle handling

at the Port of Hambantota. Meanwhile, vehicle

handling carried out at the Port of Hambantota for

transshipment purposes also witnessed a year-on-

year contraction of 10.8 per cent to 336,021 vehicles

in 2020.

The Government’s efforts to enhance

infrastructure facilities in the major ports of

the country continued during 2020, although

several setbacks were caused by the

COVID-19 pandemic and trade union actions.

A feasibility study for the Colombo North Port

Development Project was underway in 2020.

The environmental impact assessment for the

development and extension of the Kankesanthurai

Port was completed in 2020 and the Cabinet of

Ministers granted approval for land acquisition

for this project. Further, the financial feasibility

study for the expansion of the Ashraf Jetty at

the Trincomalee Port was completed during the

year. Subsequent to trade union action against

the proposed foreign partnership for the ECT

development project, the Cabinet of Ministers

granted approval in February 2021 to operate the

ECT as a container terminal fully owned by the

SLPA. Further, approval was granted to develop

and operate the West Container Terminal (WCT) of

the Colombo Port through a partnership between

SLPA and parties nominated by the Governments

of India and Japan on the basis of returning the

same within 35 years.

The financial performance of the SLPA

improved during 2020 despite the decline in

port activities. Total revenue of the SLPA declined

by 4.5 per cent to Rs. 38.9 billion, while operating

expenditure also declined by 20.6 per cent to

Rs. 29.7 billion. Accordingly, the SLPA recorded

a profit before taxes of Rs. 20.3 billion in 2020

compared to that of Rs. 16.2 billion recorded in

2019.

Communication Services

The telecommunications sector of the

country served as the cornerstone to the

continuity of several key economic activities,

amid mobility restrictions and health

regulations imposed to curb the spread of

COVID-19. Despite the mobility restrictions that

were in place across the country and public

health measures imposed curbing in-person

attendance, activities across several key sectors,

such as banking, health, education, retail and

public administration, were able to continue to

a great extent due to the innovative services

provided by telecommunications providers. With

the immediate need to transit away from physical

platforms and thereby the growing demand for

telecommunications services, there was a notable

growth in the numbers of telephone connections.

The number of mobile phone connections

registered a decline.

With the introduction of ‘work-from-home’

arrangements and the imposition of mobility

restrictions, there was a substantial growth in

internet usage. As people were largely confined

to their residences amid the pandemic, there

was a considerable rise in internet usage, for

work, education, shopping, banking and leisure

purposes. Accordingly, total internet connections,

comprising mobile and fixed internet connections,

grew by 30.7 per cent during 2020. While data

usage continued to grow throughout the year, a

sharp peak was observed during the nationwide

lockdown in March and April and a second peak

was observed during the second wave, during

the months of October and November. Although

the sector is preparing to move from 4G to 5G

services, concerns have been raised regarding

the quality of internet services in Sri Lanka.

Continued investment in the existing network

infrastructure can help resolve quality issues.

This will be essential as the economy’s pace of

digitialisation grows rapidly.

Given the importance of improved

telecommunications services amidst the

pandemic, several initiatives were undertaken

by the Telecommunications Regulatory

Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) and the

Information and Communication Technology

Agency (ICTA) to proactively guide the sector

during 2020. The TRCSL commenced the

Gamata Sannivedanaya project to identify areas

of the country that are unserved or underserved

in relation to 4G/Broadband coverage. Further,

considering the growing demand for internet data

volumes at affordable prices for work-from-home

and study-from-home arrangements, the TRCSL

approved several special tariff plans of various

operators during the pandemic period. However,

school children in some remote areas experienced

numerous difficulties in accessing on-line teaching

sessions, due to lack of internet and broadband

coverage. This calls for remedial steps to be taken

under the Government's island-wide digitalisation

programme. The TRCSL is also engaged in

innovative initiatives suited to the changing needs

of the economy, such as mobile number portability

and unlimited internet packages, which are expected

to materialise during 2021. The ICTA continued to

implement several projects aimed at improving

the digital infrastructure base of the economy.

This included the Lanka Government Network

2.0, Lanka Government Cloud 2.0, Digital Health

Project and Industry Development Programme.

Further, in collaboration with other institutions,

the ICTA also established a video conferencing

platform for Sri Lanka’s state sector (meet.gov.

lk), an online tool for tracing COVID-19 infected

data shared by medical authorities (MyHealth

app), a web portal for overseas Sri Lankans who

require support from the Government (www.

contactsrilanka.mfa.gov.lk) and a national website

for providing COVID-19 related information (www.

covid19.gov.lk).

In accordance with the National Policy

strategy of ‘Establishing a Technology-based

Society’, several activities were carried out by

the Government towards firmly establishing

a digital government, digital economy and

digital services. Accordingly, several projects,

including the e-Grama Niladari project, Sri Lanka

Digital Economy Strategy and Enhancement of

Digital Literacy of Students and Teachers were in

progress during the year. Meanwhile, a National

Certification Authority was established by the Sri

Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team

(SLCERT) Coordination Centre with a view to

facilitating the legal, administrative and technical

framework for granting, managing and enforcing

the use of digital certificates.

The performance of the Department of Posts

(DOP) was subdued throughout 2020 due to

the COVID-19 pandemic. The outbreak weighed

negatively on postal services as the Government

restricted the movement of people and goods to

contain the transmission of COVID-19. Disruptions

in international postal networks also hampered

the performance of the DOP. Amid these

constraints, the DOP established a system to

deliver medicines required by patients registered

at clinics in Government hospitals. Further, the

DOP also continued to facilitate the payment of

government pensions, farmers' pensions, and

elderly and other social beneficiary allowances.

The DOP carried out these services through 653

main post offices, 3,409 sub post offices and 134

agency post offices. Overall, the financial position

of the DOP remained weak in 2020. As per

provisional financial statements, the DOP recorded

an operating loss of Rs. 7.7 billion in 2020, in

comparison to the loss of Rs. 5.3 billion in 2019.

This was the combined outcome of a 24.2 per cent

decline in revenue to Rs. 6.4 billion and a 2.2 per

cent increase in operating expenditure to Rs. 14.0

billion during 2020. With due consideration to the

lack of improvements in revenue compared to the

rising expenses, the DOP developed a Business

Development Plan with strategies to create

effective income generating avenues. Considering

the changing nature of activities and the needs

of the economy, it is essential to focus on the

urgent modernisation of the DOP’s domestic and

international services to reap the benefits of the

growing demand for courier services.

Water Supply and Irrigation

In accordance with the Government’s policy

priority of ensuring the provision of clean and

safe drinking water to the entire population,

the National Water Supply and Drainage Board

(NWS&DB) strived to increase the access to

pipe borne water during 2020. Despite COVID-19

related disruptions, 122,733 new water supply

connections were provided by the NWS&DB, and

as at end 2020, there were 2.6 million connections.

Further, access to safe drinking water in Sri Lanka

increased to 93.2 per cent in 2020 from 91.9 per cent

in the previous year. During the year, non-revenue

water usage of the country declined slightly to

24.6 per cent from 25.1 per cent in 2019.

Meanwhile, the NWS&DB recorded a net profit

of Rs. 532.9 million during the year, compared to

the loss of Rs. 1.2 billion recorded in the previous

year. This was largely due to the increase in

total revenue during the period under review.

During the year, the NWS&DB undertook several

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2020

92

projects to enhance access to safe drinking

water. Accordingly, the Ruwanwella Water Supply

Project was commenced in 2020, aiming to

provide safe drinking water to 35,000 people living

in Ruwanwella, Bulathkohupitiya and Yatiyantota.

Meanwhile, the Kelani Right Bank Water Supply

Project II, which commenced in 2017, was

completed during the year. This project seeks

to provide potable water supply facilities to meet

the increasing demand for water in urban areas,

particularly in Kelaniya, Kadawatha, Wattala,

Peliyagoda, Mahara, Ragama, Biyagama,

Welisara, Kandana, Ja-ela, Pamunugama, and

Ekala. Despite these efforts, some remote villages

continue to experience many hardships due to

non-availability of pipe-borne drinking water. The

Water Supply and Sanitation Project in Jaffna and

Kilinochchi was also underway during the year.

The project will expand access to safe drinking

water for 689,000 people in the city of Jaffna,

surrounding suburbs and several townships in the

peninsula. In addition, the Greater Matale Water

Supply Project, which aims to address issues

pertaining to low quality drinking water and low

coverage of pipe borne water supply in the Matale

District, was also underway during the year and is

expected to be completed in 2021.

The Irrigation Department continued its

activities during 2020, ensuring sustainable

management of water resources for irrigation

and other domestic purposes. There were 25

irrigation projects in progress during 2020 under

the purview of the Irrigation Department. The total

expenditure incurred during the year on irrigation

projects amounted to Rs. 6.7 billion, of which

expenditure on the Yan Oya Reservoir project

was Rs. 5.4 billion during the year. The Uma

Oya downstream development project achieved

physical progress of 91.5 per cent by end 2020.

The Climate Resilience Improvement Project

(CRIP), which has been designed as a 5-year

project spanning from 2014 to 2019 with the

objective of implementing adverse climate shock

resilience improvements in hydraulic infrastructure,

was extended to 2020. The approved estimated

cost of the CRIP is Rs. 5,736.5 million, of which

Rs. 4,038.7 million had been spent by end 2020.

The Productivity Enhancement and Irrigation

System Efficiency Improvement project (PEISEIP),

which commenced in 2017, continued to progress

in 2020, albeit at a slower pace due to COVID-19

related disturbances. The project aims at enhancing

land, water and crop productivity of 80 irrigation

schemes in the country.

3.3 Social Infrastructure Policies, Institutional Framework and Performance

Health

Although Sri Lanka faced severe challenges

in containing the two waves of the COVID-19

outbreak, collaborative actions of the health

sector and other stakeholders enabled

the country to maintain the case load at a

manageable level during 2020. Following the

identification of the first COVID-19 case in January

Although the fatalities increased, in comparison

to the first wave, it remained low relative to many

other countries with a similar number of reported

cases. Collaborative actions of the health sector,

the tri forces, the police, universities and the

research community, intelligence services, and

numerous other public and private sector workers

contributed to the effective management of the

outbreak. By 31 March 2021, total number of cases

and total number of deaths were 92,706 and 568,

respectively. This reflected 4,229 cumulative cases

per one million persons and a 0.61 per cent fatality

rate. A majority of the COVID-19 deaths occurred

due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs)

related complications that were aggravated by

the COVID-19 infection. Notably, deaths in the

above 60-years category accounted for around

70 per cent of the COVID-19 related deaths,

as the aged population is more prone to NCDs.

Meanwhile, 89,407 COVID-19 patients recovered

by 31 March 2021 registering a 96.4 per cent

recovery rate. Further, Sri Lanka commenced the

COVID-19 vaccination programme in January

2021, by inoculating the health sector and other

front-line workers in the battle against COVID-19.

By 31 March 2021, the number of vaccination

doses administered per 100 people amounted to

4.2 in Sri Lanka.

2020, Sri Lanka took proactive measures to rein

in the outbreak through screening at entry points

to the country, augmenting the testing facilities,

isolating and hospitalising all infected persons,

contact tracing and quarantining contacts at

designated centres, and upscaling the human

and physical resources to combat the pandemic,

such as increasing the hospitals designated

for treating COVID-19 patients and increasing

intensive care unit capacities. During the first

wave, the Government took early and decisive

steps to curtail the spread of the virus through the

imposition of a nationwide lockdown and mobility

restrictions from mid-March to end-April. Although

the lockdown was gradually eased from early May,

limitations on social gatherings, social distancing

measures and mandatory use of facemasks were

continued to limit the possibility of a resurgence

of the outbreak locally. Guidelines were issued

instructing all sectors and the general public to

embrace and work under new normal conditions,

ensuring strict adherence to prevention and control

measures of COVID-19. Accordingly, the first wave

of the pandemic was successfully contained by

end-July 2020, and since then, locally acquired

COVID-19 cases were not reported until the end

of the third quarter. However, the second wave of

COVID-19 emerged in early October, resulting in

a rapid spread of the pandemic across the country

with new clusters appearing in industrial zones

and main food supply chains, especially in the

densely populated Western Province. Learning

from the experiences in the first local outbreak

and global pandemic responses, the Government

implemented regional lockdown measures,

depending on the risk of disease spread in different

areas, instead of locking down the entire economy.

Despite the sharp escalation in the number of cases

during the second wave, Sri Lanka was still able

to maintain the case load at a manageable level

with the existing resources of the health sector.

Several other outbreaks of communicable

diseases were observed in Sri Lanka in 2020.

During the year, the Dengue epidemic was subdued

to some extent since mobility restrictions compelled

people to stay in their residences thereby enabling

them to maintain a cleaner environment while

keeping their premises free of mosquito breeding.

Accordingly, a total of 31,017 Dengue cases with

36 deaths were reported during the year reflecting a

fatality rate of 0.12 per cent, as opposed to 105,049

Dengue cases and a fatality rate of 0.15 per cent, in

2019. Due to social distancing measures, as well as

the usage of facemasks, the usual seasonal Influenza

pattern was also not observed during the year. A total

of 8,545 cases of leptospirosis were identified locally

in 2020. Meanwhile, in July 2020, the World Health

Organization (WHO) certified that Sri Lanka has

eliminated Rubella, three years ahead of the target

set by the WHO.

Although the priorities of the country’s health

sector changed in 2020 with attention deviating

from NCDs to communicable diseases, the

public health system continued its efforts to

reduce the NCD burden in the country. Although

most activities planned to prevent and control NCDs

were disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the

Ministry of Health (MoH) continued with surveillance

and monitoring activities related to NCDs, while

attempting to provide uninterrupted services to

patients who were receiving long term care from

government hospitals. Accordingly, the MoH took

measures to distribute medicines to the homes of

NCD patients who were undergoing long term follow

up at government hospitals. This was carried out

by postal delivery and delivery through health and

non-health government officers, village leaders and

volunteers. Awareness campaigns were conducted

through mass media and social media to promote

healthy lifestyles and to educate the general public

on the identification of warning signs of emergencies

related to NCDs and how to obtain medical services

in an emergency. Public Health Nursing Officers,

who provide NCD related care to the community,

were given guidelines on how to provide home-based

essential palliative care to needy NCD patients in

the community. Further, a telemedicine system was

launched in 16 Nephrology clinics in government

hospitals to facilitate communication with high risk

immunity compromised patients.

The Government continued its efforts to

augment physical and human resources in the

health sector. Construction activities related to

district general hospitals in Hambantota and Nuwara

Eliya and the construction of National Nephrology

Hospital in Polonnaruwa were completed during the

year. Numerous physical infrastructure development

projects, such as the Matara District Maternal and

New-born Health Care Strengthening Project,

Northern Province hospitals development project,

the development of Ambulatory Care Centre at the

National Hospital Sri Lanka, Primary Healthcare

System Strengthening Project, and the construction

of a maternity hospital in Karapitiya and the Heart

Centre at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital continued

during 2020. During the two waves of the COVID-19

pandemic, the Government spent approximately

Rs. 4.5 billion for the distribution of medical

equipment to combat the pandemic. In terms of

indicators, there was one doctor for every 1,117

persons, one nurse for every 582 persons and

3.5 beds for every 1,000 persons in the state

hospitals by end 2020. Meanwhile, government

hospitals contained 715 Intensive Care Unit (ICU)

beds as at end 2020, reflecting 3.3 ICU beds

per 100,000 persons. Enhancement of physical

resources in the health sector, particularly intensive

care facilities, is needed to combat not only the

COVID-19 pandemic, but also other contagious

diseases, such as Dengue.

Private sector healthcare services also

played a vital role in 2020, despite the challenges

posed by the pandemic. There were 217 private

hospitals in operation by end 2020, with a capacity

of 5,173 beds. Guidelines were issued to private

healthcare providers on clinical management of

COVID-19 patients and suspected patients as well

as on PCR testing. Amidst mobility restrictions,

leading healthcare providers resorted to the use

of novel approaches, such as provision of online

disease screening facilities and consultation

services via telemedicine, to address the medical

needs of patients. In order to provide home delivery

of drugs for those who usually purchase drugs

from the private sector, a web based mechanism

was established with state and private pharmacies

in collaboration with the Pharmacy Owners

Association. More than 1,800 pharmacies around

the country were involved and this service covered

96.3 per cent of Medical Officer of Health areas in

the country.

Education

With the establishment of the Presidential

Task Force on Education in early 2020, the

Ministry of Education commenced a rigorous

review of the current education system,

along with relevant stakeholders. Proposed

educational reforms are to include the revision of

curriculum and learning strategies, broadening

and standardisation of teacher development,

recognition of the relationships between education,

occupation and productive moral and social

contribution as members of society. The review

and subsequent implementation of proposals,

although spearheaded by the Ministry of Education

(MOE), are to be undertaken in collaboration

with all stakeholders, including the relevant State

Ministries. With the view of increasing the number

of national schools to 1,000 through the upgrading

of selected provincial schools, 123 schools have

already been identified to be upgraded under phase

I and another 671 schools under phase II. Further,

one new trilingual school is to be established per

district. The ‘13 Years of Mandatory Education

programme’ was expanded to cover 421 schools

and a financial incentive of Rs. 500 per day was

granted to institutionalised students, based on their

attendance. Under this programme, 1,142 students

completed National Vocational Qualification (NVQ)

Level 4 training and another 5,650 students are to

commence the NVQ training. Throughout the year,

physical and teaching infrastructure were upgraded

to ensure the success of this programme. Other

key initiatives of the MOE included programmes

to improve the quality of school infrastructure and

to expand student exposure to subjects, such as

Mathematics, Science, English and other foreign

languages, Technological Education, Business

Studies and Accounting, among others. Initiatives

towards teacher development, education and

management were also undertaken. In early

2020, approval was obtained from the Cabinet

of Ministers to implement the National Policy

on Pre-School Education to uplift the quality of

pre-school education. The approval was obtained in

March 2021 to establish the National Management

and Regulatory Committee on Early Childhood

Education, comprising field experts and other key

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2020

96

public stakeholders to regulate, monitor and provide

national guidance on pre-schools, early childhood

development centres and daycare centres.

Despite intermittent school closures from

March 2020 onwards, with the longest periods

of closure seen across the Western Province,

several innovative initiatives were undertaken

to facilitate the continuity of educational

activities. In an attempt to continue educational

activities to some degree, the MOE partnered with

telecommunications providers to facilitate online

teaching and learning. The national e-learning

portal of the MOE, e-thaksalawa was rapidly

developed to disseminate a wide variety of learning

material for all grades to facilitate continued learning

from home. The MOE continued to collaborate

with relevant stakeholders to broadcast several

educational programmes titled ‘Guru Gedara’,

both in Sinhala and Tamil via dedicated television

channels, while launching a new television channel

with the National Institute of Education (NIE) for

G.C.E. Ordinary Level and G.C.E. Advanced

Level students. Before the reopening of schools,

the MOE provided instructions on COVID-19

prevention measures such as disinfection, water

supply for hand washing, classroom arrangements,

and other aspects required to create a safe

learning environment. Amid the challenges of

COVID-19, the Grade 5 Scholarship and G.C.E.

Advanced Level and Ordinary Level Examinations

were successfully held by the Department of

Examinations with special examination centres

being set up and transport facilities being provided

for those in quarantine areas and for those who

were undergoing treatment in hospitals. During

both waves of the pandemic in the second and

fourth quarters of the year, the Western Province

experienced the longest school closures. For

grades 5, 11 and 13, educational activities resumed

prior to their respective national examinations

for short periods of time. Subsequent to the

second wave, educational activities for all grades

were resumed with the reopening of schools

from end March 2021 in a phased manner and

with student attendance being determined by

the size of the class. While commending the

multi-sector solutions developed by the MOE to

tackle the challenges arising from COVID-19, it

must be emphasised that the experience during the

COVID-19 pandemic must be used in designing

any future transition initiatives to online education

and other alternatives to ‘in-school’ learning.

Online teaching and learning experiences over the

past year highlight that, despite the relatively quick

adoption of new teaching and learning methods by

teachers, students, and relevant authorities, there

are significant disparities in access to technology-

related infrastructure at school level as well as

student level and limitations on teachers’ capacity

to utilise devices for teaching. There needs to

be a coordinated multi-sectoral infrastructure

investment initiative to continue blended learning

approaches. This is crucial for the creation of

effective educational outcomes, especially among

disadvantaged student groups across varied

family income levels and across various learning

difficulties.

The higher education system continued

to undertake academic activities via remote

learning systems amidst the disruptions

caused by the pandemic. During the period of

closure, universities rapidly initiated online learning

through the Learning Management System (LMS),

which had been a part of the blended learning

system pursued by state universities. 502,000

Zoom sessions were conducted with a total of

22.3 million online participations over the period

from end March 2020 till end January 2021.

Such rapid adoption of education technology by

both staff and students and their enthusiastic

engagement is highly commendable. However,

as in the case of school education, disadvantaged

student groups may have been disproportionately

impacted by the change in the mode of delivery of

higher education as well. During the period, the

University Grants Commission (UGC) stipulated

guidelines for alternative assessment methods

due to the inability to conduct closed book

written examinations. Meanwhile, the Cabinet of

Ministers granted approval to uplift the Gampaha

Wickramarachchi Ayurveda Institute into a

fully-fledged University that is aligned with the

development goals of the Gampaha district. The

Cabinet of Ministers approved an amendment

to the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978 to enable

the establishment of two separate universities

as ‘universities with specific purposes’ to replace

Colleges of Nursing and Teacher Training

Colleges. A ‘Virtual University’ based on modern

information and communication technologies,

is to be established by the Government as

a public sector, non-profit institution with the

aim of improving access to high quality higher

education programmes in an affordable manner

and with no geographical barriers. In line with the

Government’s development agenda, proposals

are underway to establish ‘City Universities’ in 10

districts to cater to their own unique developmental

needs. The UGC also continued to expand the

academic capacity of state universities through

the granting of approvals for the establishment of

new faculties, departments, and undergraduate

and postgraduate programmes. With the view of

addressing the continued prevalence of ragging,

the UGC provided communication portals

for complaints while conducting awareness

and orientation programmes for new entrants

regarding the same.

The private sector continued to engage in

the provision of tertiary education alongside

the Government. As at end 2020, there were

21 Non-State Higher Education Institutes (NSHEIs)

recognised as degree awarding institutes offering

164 accredited degree programmes. During

the year, three new NSHEIs were recognised

as degree awarding institutes and 18 new

degree programmes offered by NSHEIs were

recognised. Meanwhile, reviews of several new

programmes were underway. The MOE, with

the view of formulating a legal framework to

establish the ‘Quality Assurance and Accreditation

Commission’, drafted a bill that was gazetted after

obtaining the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers.

The gazette is currently undergoing stakeholder

consultation. With due consideration to the issue of

employability of graduates, approval was granted

by the Cabinet of Ministers to consider STEM+A

subjects, i.e., Science, Technology, Engineering

and Mathematics through Art.

With due consideration to the contemporary

skill needs of the economy, the Technical and

Vocational Education and Training (TVET)

sector continued its activities to improve the

skills base of the labour force. By the end of 2020,

there were 1,239 registered institutions in the TVET

sector conducting over 3,400 accredited courses.

In an attempt to improve the relevancy of vocational

qualification programs, the Tertiary and Vocational

Education Commission (TVEC) developed new

National Competency Standards for over forty NVQ

programmes while revising said standards for over

twenty five NVQ programmes. Responding to the

transition of TVET to online platforms, the TVEC

developed evaluation criteria for the registration

of training institutes providing online courses and

an online system to collect information on the

training performance of students. To ensure some

continuity of educational and training endeavours,

the TVEC conducted several webinar sessions and

collaborated with television channels to broadcast

a series of lessons for vocational trainees across

a range of subject areas during this period. The

TVEC also continued to liaise closely with industry

representatives and developed a database of

industry representatives. Currently, initiatives are

underway to match the local NVQ framework with

other similar foreign qualification frameworks to

improve the employability of the qualified workforce

abroad.

Housing and Urban Development

Impacted by the adverse consequences

of the COVID-19 pandemic, housing and

urban development activities led by the

Government remained subdued in 2020. The

Urban Development Authority (UDA) continued

to carry out the Middle Income Housing project

in 2020, which seeks to provide housing for

government employees and professionals at

reasonable prices. Accordingly, the ‘Oval View’

and ‘Lake Crest’ government servants’ housing

schemes were completed during 2020. Further,

the UDA commenced an Upper Middle Income

Housing Project in Borella, comprising 400 housing

units, while two other housing projects are to be

commenced in Thalawathugoda. In the meantime,

another affordable housing scheme comprising

5,000 housing units is to be commenced in 2021,

targeting the middle income population in Colombo

and other major cities. Further, the National Housing

and Development Authority (NHDA) launched a

new housing programme ‘Obata Geyak - Ratata

Hetak’, with the intention of catering to the housing

requirements of low income families. The initial

project target of constructing 14,022 housing units

annually was later revised in 2020 to 10,000 housing

units due to limited budgetary allocations as well

as disruptions to construction activities caused by

the pandemic. Under this programme, the NHDA’s

plan is to provide a grant of Rs. 600,000 for at least

one low income earning family per Grama Niladhari

division. Under this programme, measures were

taken to commence construction of 9,972 housing

units in 2020, of which 3,949 housing units were

completed on participatory basis during the year.

Development activities in the Colombo

Port City project continued in 2020. More than

90 per cent of work in relation to infrastructure

development, including the waste water system,

irrigation reservoir, potable reservoir and pumping

stations had been completed by end 2020, while

construction activities of external utility supply

services were under progress during the year.

Although construction activities related to the Port

City project were put on hold during the months of

March and April due to COVID-19 related mobility

restrictions imposed by the Government, these are

currently being expedited. The project is expected

to emerge as a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in

the South Asian region. Accordingly, preliminary

work on the construction of the Financial and

Commercial centre has already commenced at a

cost of US dollars 1.1 billion. The Colombo Port

City Economic Commission Bill was gazetted in

end March 2021, outlining the establishment of the

SEZ and the regulatory framework that is to govern

the SEZ.

The Government’s efforts to establish

an efficient waste management system in

urban areas continued to progress in 2020.

Development activities under the Metro Colombo

Solid Waste Management Project (MCSWMP)

continued during the year, attaining cumulative

financial and physical progress of 80 per cent

by the end of the year. Although the project was

planned to be completed by end 2020, construction

activities were delayed due to the outbreak of

COVID-19. Under the said project, construction

activities of the Aruwakkalu sanitary landfill facility

attained progress of almost 98 per cent, while

pre-commissioning of the leachate treatment plant

at Aruwakkalu was initiated in 2020. Construction

activities relating to the solid waste transfer stations

at Kelaniya and Aruwakkalu under the MCSWMP

continued during the year, recording physical

progress of 60 per cent and 92 per cent, respectively,

by end 2020. Further, the Kerawalapitiya Waste

Project (KWP), which was initiated after the

failure of the Meethotamulla open dump in 2017,

continued during 2020. In addition, in line with the

Government’s policy concept of ‘converting waste

to resource’, the first waste to energy power plant

in Sri Lanka commenced operations in early 2021

in partnership with a private company.

Poverty Alleviation and Safety Nets

The COVID-19 pandemic may pose a

significant challenge to maintaining the

progress in poverty reduction over the

past three decades. According to the

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2020

100

Household Income and Expenditure Survey

(HIES)-2016, the Poverty Headcount Ratio

(PHCR) had declined to 4.1 per cent in 2016 from

6.7 per cent recorded in 2012/13. In 2016, it

was estimated that the number of individuals

living below the poverty line had declined from

1.3 million during the 2012/13 survey period to

0.8 million in 2016. Despite this decline in the

poor population between the two survey periods,

2016 survey data showed that significant

disparities in the level of poverty across provinces

and districts continued to persist with those in

the Western Province being better off than their

peers across the country. COVID-19 may have

aggravated these disparities between urban,

rural, and estate areas. The pandemic may have

also had a significant impact on urban poverty,

which had been consistently low in the past, as

several urban cities, especially within Colombo,

experienced the longest periods of lockdown

or mobility restrictions due to the spread of

COVID-19 in these densely populated areas.

Across the country, the COVID-19 outbreak

is expected to have had the highest impact

on the informal sector low-wage workers in

low-income households whose nature of employment

neither allowed for ‘work-from-home’ options nor

provided any paid leave during the peak of the

pandemic. Despite the return of the economy

to normalcy, lingering effects of the pandemic

will weigh negatively on the livelihoods of

these population segments. With almost

57.4 per cent of those employed lying outside the

ambit of formal employment, the socioeconomic

security of such population segments is weak in

the wake of these shocks.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the

Government undertook several measures

to protect low-income and vulnerable

households while striving to mitigate the

financial burden on households stemming

from the loss of livelihoods during the

lockdown and thereafter. In the wake of the

COVID-19 outbreak, the Government, recognising

the fragile financial status of low-income

households, provided an allowance of Rs. 5,000

per vulnerable household in two rounds. In each

of these rounds, approximately 5 million families

had benefited, and Rs. 25 billion was disbursed.

In the meantime, the Government and the

Central Bank, working closely with the financial

sector, continued to facilitate debt moratoria on

capital and interest, provided working capital at

low-interest rates, and reduced interest rates.

The rapid implementation of such measures is

expected to have mitigated the financial burden

on households to some extent. However, the

low-income and vulnerable households, which

have little access to formal financial markets, are

likely to have been disproportionately affected

by these economic shocks. As a new initiative

towards alleviating poverty the Government

also commenced the provision of employment

opportunities to unskilled workers from extremely

poor households, who have no formal education

or with educational attainment lower than G.C.E.

Ordinary Level.

The Government continued to implement

various projects and programmes during the

year to uplift the socio-economic wellbeing

of low-income and vulnerable individuals

and households. The Department of Samurdhi

Development (DSD) distributed Rs. 52.5 billion

among 1.8 million beneficiary families under the

Samurdhi Relief programme during 2020. With the

view of offering a financial buffer during any special

occasions or difficult times, Rs. 1.6 billion was

distributed among 358,343 beneficiary families

under the Samurdhi Social Security programme.

The DSD also continued several livelihood,

entrepreneurship, and social development

programmes to help beneficiaries improve their

overall socio-economic well-being. During the

year, despite several disruptions, the State Ministry

of Women and Child Development, Pre-Schools

and Primary Education, School Infrastructure

and Education Services continued the nutrition

allowance programme targeting expectant and

lactating mothers and the morning meal programme

for pre-school children and/or early childhood

development centres, especially targeting

low-income families. The latter programme, which

cost Rs. 76.5 million, covered 85,798 children.

Several other initiatives to promote day care

centres, upskill women, and safeguard the rights

of women and children were also undertaken by

the State Ministry during the year. Meanwhile,

the rapidly ageing population is likely to have

substantial implications on poverty in the coming

years. With a substantial portion of the labour force

being in the informal sector and in the private sector,

both of which do not benefit from a formal pension

system, there is a dire need for a nationwide

contributory pension scheme to support future

retirees. In the absence of such a scheme, retirees

may resort to other social security schemes of the

Government in the future creating a substantial

fiscal burden over several years along with the

consistent rise in life expectancy. This will further

aggravate existing issues in the Government’s

financial support and poverty alleviation schemes,

such as ambiguous identification, entry and exit

procedures, which lead to ineffective targeting.

Environment

Striking a balance between economic

growth and protection of the environment is

vital to ensure sustainable growth and thereby,

macroeconomic stability. Economic growth

derived through an unsustainable rate of resource

consumption and disregard for environmental

impact mitigation measures, can result in the

depletion and degradation of natural resources,

such as forests, water bodies and soil, and can

also lead to the accumulation of waste and thereby

environmental pollution. In turn, these can culminate

in climate change. Needless to say, these will

negatively impact agricultural productivity, energy

generation and tourism sector activities, especially

considering that ecotourism is a growing niche in

the country. In the Global Climate Risk Index 2019,

Sri Lanka was ranked 30 out of 180 countries in

2019 and was ranked 23 out of 180 countries in

terms of overall performance over the period 2000

– 2019. While the country has moved out of the

'10 most affected countries’ category in the index,

climate change related vulnerabilities still persist

with far reaching impact, as seen in the case of both

droughts and floods in Sri Lanka. Impact of climate

change on economic activity, human population

and ecosystems may be irreversible and potentially

systemic as its materialisation could transform

the functioning of the entire economy. With due

consideration to these, there is a growing need for

policymakers and relevant stakeholders to urgently

prioritise responsible resource consumption,

environmental conservation measures and climate

change adaptation strategies in the development

policy agenda of the country.

During 2020, the Central Environment

Authority (CEA) continued to engage in

initiatives pertaining to the control of

environmental pollution and waste management

activities. In addition to monitoring industrial

activities to ensure pollution control, the CEA

continued to ensure compliance with environmental

standards while encouraging prevention of pollution,

waste minimisation and cleaner production by

industries, through the issuance of Environmental

Protection Licenses (EPLs) to industries.

Accordingly, during the year, 1,242 EPLs were

issued for industrial activities and 3 EPLs were

issued to BOI zones. Further, the CEA issued two

Environmental Impact Assessment certificates and

98 Initial Environmental Examination certificates

during the year. Under the e-waste management

programme, the CEA, with the support of the DOP,

collected 77.5 MT of e-waste from households and

handed over to e-waste collectors. Meanwhile, the

CEA developed an online spatial database for the

management of environmental resources in Sri

Lanka and updated the data layers, such as wildlife

reserves and forest reserves.

According to the Forest Cover Assessment

Survey – 2015 (published in 2020) of the

Department of Forest Conservation, the

estimated total forest cover of the country was

1,865,671 hectares representing 28.4 per cent

of the land in Sri Lanka. As per the preceding

Forest Cover Survey that was published in 2010,

the forest cover estimate was 29.7 per cent. Since

forest cover estimation is not adjusted for the

extent of land reforested and deforested annually

until the findings of the next survey is published,

recent forest cover estimates do not provide the

current situation with regard to forest resources

in the country. Therefore, Sri Lanka needs to

maintain a database on forest cover with up to

date information collected through new digital

geospatial technologies to identify unauthorised

and environmentally unsustainable level of

deforestation.

The Department of Meteorology (DoM),

the National Building Research Organisation

(NBRO) and the Disaster Management Centre

(DMC) continued to carry out numerous

activities to provide early warnings and to

improve the country’s disaster preparedness

and disaster responses. During 2020, the DoM

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

103

issued 5,718 forecasts and 513 warnings and

advisories to the general public, related disaster

management authorities and fisheries community

to facilitate early preparedness activities and to

minimise the natural disaster risks. In addition,

the DoM, in collaboration with the Indian National

Centre for Ocean Information Services, issued

three oil spill advisories indicating the hypothetical

oil drift pattern from the vessel New Diamond,

which caught fire off the Eastern coast of Sri Lanka

in September 2020, to identify the trajectory and

zones that could have been affected by the oil spill.

The DMC coordinated with other stakeholders to

implement national, district-wise, divisional and

local level disaster preparedness and post-disaster

response activities during the Amphan and Burevi

tropical cyclones in 2020. Meanwhile, the NBRO

adopted structural mitigation measures for three

unstable slopes and sites of potential landslides

selected on a priority basis. In 2020, the NBRO

expanded its network of automated rain gauges

to 300 gauges in 14 landslide prone districts for

monitoring rainfall and real time data acquisition for

effective landslide early warning.
