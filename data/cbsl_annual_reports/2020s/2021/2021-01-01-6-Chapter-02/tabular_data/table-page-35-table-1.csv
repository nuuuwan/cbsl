"Lack  of 
focus,  motivation  and  productivity  due 
distractions  in  home  working  environment,  conflicts  in 
work and household responsibilities, poor infrastructure 
arrangements  on  a 
large  scale  during  pandemic 
and  network 
facilities,  and  absence  of 
face-to-face 
period, benefits of this paradigm shift can be reaped 
monitoring are the disadvantages of WFH arrangements. 
Accordingly,  with  a  drastic  change  in  the  employer-
employee 
managing,  controlling  and  measuring  performance 
of  employees  should  also  be  established  in  order  to 
maintain the motivation levels and performance of the 
employees. This includes, moving away from traditional 
command  and  control  style  of  management  towards 
results-based  management  (ILO,  2020)  and  frequent 
communication and checks. In addition, new methods 
of communicating and interacting should be in place to 
maintain company culture and team cohesiveness, and 
to minimise the mental strain of employees. Meanwhile, 
maintaining 
should be a priority in the permanent adoption of WFH 
arrangement  in  order  to  prevent  overworking  related 
long term effects on the physical and mental health of 
the  employees,  work-family  conflicts  and  maintain  an 
optimal level of productivity in the long run. 
Employees 
between  work  and  household  responsibilities  through 
proper arrangements for dependent care and household 
responsibilities 
regular  communication  and  interaction  with  the  team, 
and  using  proper  physical  infrastructure  are  important 
in  achieving  an  optimal  level  of  productivity  in  WFH 
arrangements in the long run.","","","","to
