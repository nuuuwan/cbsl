infrastructure and private sector ventures, particularly in the 
last  decade.  However,  given  the  persistent  gap  between 
savings  and  required  investment,  difficulties  in  attracting 
Such difficulties have had a multifaceted impact on growth, 
employment and income distribution. In the current context, 
the unforeseeable future bundled with the global pandemic 
has escalated the spectrum of challenges for Sri Lanka to 
address, including the need to reduce overdependency on 
debt creating foreign inflows, in order to sustain medium 
to  long  run  economic  growth  and  stability.  Against  this 
backdrop, the country has redoubled its efforts to attract 
foreign  direct 
non-debt  creating  inflows.  In  doing  so,  it  is  crucial  to 
improve the investment landscape, which could be done 
by  focussing  on  improving  Sri  Lanka’s  global  rankings 
(Table  B  2.1),  thereby  enhancing  the  country’s  viability 
as a preferred destination for investors based on different 
aspects of socio-economic conditions.

Sri  Lanka  was  positioned  at  the  99th  place  out  of  190 
countries in the Ease of Doing Business Index1 of the World 
Bank in 2020, advancing by one position from the ranking 
in 2019. An overall score of 61.8 was recorded covering 
10 areas of focus. In terms of the Global Competitiveness 
Index2 compiled by the World Economic Forum, Sri Lanka 
was  positioned  at  the  84th  place  in  2019  out  of  141 
countries, and this was also an advancement of one place 
from  the  previous  year.  Both  these  reports  highlight  the 
areas  of  the  economy,  which  hinder  investor  confidence 
and competitiveness. Based on the results, the followings 
could  be  highlighted  as 
attention and timely redressal, not only to attract potential 
foreign investors, but also to facilitate domestic investments 
(Figure B 2.1).
Macroeconomic Stability
Maintaining  macroeconomic  stability,  including  low  and 
stable inflation, is an important prerequisite for attracting 
investors.  In  a  volatile  environment,  investors  are  unable 
to predict their future performance and profitability. During 
the past several years, with the support of prudent monetary
