2.1 OverviewT

he Sri Lankan economy contracted by 3.6 per cent in 2020 on year-on-year basis in the backdrop of unprecedented disturbances to socio-economic activities due to adverse impacts of COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic itself, together with related restrictions to contain the spread of pandemic, dragged down the

performance of economies all over the world and Sri Lanka was no exception. Some of the business sentiment

indices compiled by the Central Bank recorded their lowest values in 2020, particularly during the second quarter,

reflecting the adverse impact of the nationwide lockdown. The pandemic situation severely affected economic

activities for which physical engagement is vital, such as construction, manufacturing and transportation, in addition

to the whole ecosystem built around the tourism industry. The setback in construction and manufacturing activities

caused the contraction in Industry activities, while Services activities were adversely affected predominantly due

to the contraction in transportation, other personal services, and accommodation, food and beverage services

activities. Meanwhile, Agriculture activities also recorded a decline largely due to the pandemic-related disturbances,

though the conducive policy environment supported the continuation of most Agriculture activities even during the

lockdown periods. Investment expenditure contracted in 2020, mainly due to the uncertainty on the recovery timeline

of the pandemic, locally as well as globally, whilst consumption expenditure recorded a slower growth. External

demand also weakened during the year on the grounds of a loss of growth momentum across geographies with

the pandemic. However, the rationalisation of non-essential imports curtailing the merchandise imports during the

year, partly contributed to buffer the deterioration in net external demand amidst the contraction in exports. In 2020,

the national savings-investment gap as a percentage of GDP narrowed on account of the considerable contraction

in investment expenditure though national savings recorded a decline of 3.6 per cent during the year, compared to

2019. In line with the adverse impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on economic activities, the labour market

exposed its long term fragilities and vulnerabilities, deepening structural issues and inequalities further. Accordingly,

resulting in a loss of family incomes, the unemployment rate increased to 5.5 per cent in 2020, the highest since 2009,

amidst a considerable decline in labour force mainly due to the drop in female labour force participation. Meanwhile,

the unemployment rate amongst females, youth and educationally qualified persons increased considerably in

2020 aggravating the inequalities further. In addition, departures for foreign employment declined sharply amidst

the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, while Sri Lankan migrant workers were also severely affected.

2.2 Gross Domestic Product (GDP),1 Gross National Income (GNI) and GDP Per Capita

Reflecting the adverse impacts related to

the COVID-19 pandemic, the GDP at constant

market prices (constant prices) contracted by

3.6 per cent, recording Rs. 9,530.6 billion in 2020,

compared to the growth of 2.3 per cent in 2019.

Meanwhile, GDP at current market prices (current

prices) was estimated at Rs. 14,973.0 billion (US

dollar 80.7 billion) in 2020, which is a decline of

0.3 per cent compared to 2019, where it stood at

Rs. 15,013.0 billion (US dollar 84.0 billion). Accordingly,

the GDP implicit deflator increased to 3.4 per cent in

2020, from 2.7 per cent recorded in 2019.

GNI, which is derived by adjusting GDP for

net primary income from the rest of the world,

recorded a marginal contraction of 0.1 per cent

at current prices in 2020, compared to the growth

of 4.9 per cent in 2019. This contraction in GNI

was attributable to the decline in the GDP at current

prices, even in the midst of an improvement in net

primary income in 2020.

GDP per capita was estimated at

Rs. 683,106 (US dollars 3,682) in 2020, compared to

Rs. 688,573 (US dollars 3,852) in 2019. The decline

in GDP per capita in rupee terms was mainly on

account of the contraction in GDP at current prices,

while the decline in GDP per capita in US dollar terms

was a combined outcome of the contraction in GDP

at current prices and the weakening of domestic

currency against the US dollar on an annual average

basis. Meanwhile, GNI per capita was estimated at

Rs. 664,620 (US dollars 3,582) in 2020, compared to

Rs. 668,748 (US dollars 3,741) in 2019.

2.3 Contribution from

Institutional Sectors

The Household and Non-Profit Institutions

Serving Households (HH and NPISH) sector

continued to be the major contributor to the

Gross Value Added (GVA) of the economy

at current prices in 2020. Accordingly, the HH

and NPISH sector grew at a marginal rate of

0.4 per cent in 2020, accounting for 48.6 per cent

of GVA of the economy. Meanwhile, the Non-

Financial Corporations (NFC) sector recorded

a contraction of 2.5 per cent, while the General

Government (GG) and Financial Corporations

(FC) sectors recorded growth rates of 7.7 per cent

and 17.7 per cent, respectively. When considering

the contribution of the institutional sectors to major

economic activities, the HH and NPISH sector

remained as the major contributor to the value

added of Agriculture and Services activities in

2020, while the value added of Industry activities

was mainly driven by the NFC sector.

2.4 Output, Policies, Institutional Support and Issues

Agriculture

Agriculture activities recorded a contraction

of 2.4 per cent in 2020 in value added terms,

compared to the growth of 1.0 per cent in

2019, due to the considerable decline in some

of the major Agriculture activities, including

fishing, growing of oleaginous fruits (including

coconut), tea, forestry and logging, and animal

production. This setback in Agriculture activities

was largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic

related disturbances on certain plantations and

fishing activities. Especially, tea production was

severely affected, particularly during March at the

beginning of the first wave of the pandemic while

fishing activities were hit hard during the first wave

as well as in the last quarter of the year following

the second wave of the pandemic. Meanwhile,

growing of vegetables, rice, cereals (except

rice), fruits and spices expanded during the year

positively contributing to the overall Agriculture

activities while conducive policy environment,

specific actions initiated by the Government and

favourable weather also supported to minimise

pandemic related downturn.

Agriculture Production

The Agriculture Production Index, which

measures only the output of the agriculture

and fisheries sectors,2 recorded an increase

of 2.3 per cent in 2020 supported by the

growth in sub-indices of paddy, rubber and

other crops (other field crops, vegetables and

fruits). However, tea, coconut, livestock and

fisheries sub-indices declined in comparison to

the previous year.

Paddy

Paddy production in 2020 increased to an

all-time high level, supported by favourable

weather conditions and conducive policies

of the Government. Paddy production, which

recorded a bumper harvest in 2019, further

increased by 11.5 per cent to 5.1 million metric

tons in 2020. The production in the 2019/2020

Maha season, which accounted for around

62 per cent of total annual production, increased by

4.0 per cent, while paddy output in the 2020

Yala season recorded an increase of 26.6 per

cent. Government intervention in the form of

guaranteed paddy purchasing price and the

provision of free fertiliser for paddy cultivation

contributed to the significant improvement in

production in 2020. Further, these government

interventions raised the household income

levels of the paddy farming community, thereby

2 Agriculture Production Index does not cover the forestry and logging sector

improving their living standards. Annual paddy

production in 2020, which is equivalent to

3.3 million metric tons of rice, is estimated to be

sufficient to meet the household rice demand of

the country for approximately 17 months.3

Paddy prices in the open market remained

elevated during 2020 compared to the

preceding year, despite the increase in

production in 2019 as well as in 2020. The

average open market paddy price of Nadu

increased by 11.0 per cent, year-on-year, to

Rs. 47.73 per kilogramme in 2020, while the

average open market paddy price of Samba

also increased by 18.2 per cent to Rs. 50.56

per kilogramme. The increase in certified paddy

purchasing prices by the Government and

the competition among private mill owners to

purchase paddy stocks above the certified prices

contributed to the increase in paddy prices. The

certified paddy purchasing price for a kilogramme

of rice for Samba and Keeri Samba (dry) paddy

varieties was increased from Rs. 41.00 in 2019

to Rs. 50.00 in 2020, while the same for Nadu

(dry) varieties was increased from Rs. 38.00 in

2019 to Rs. 50.00 in 2020. Meanwhile, certified

price for paddy with high moisture content was

set at Rs. 44.00 per kilogramme. Due to higher

market power enjoyed by a few rice millers, retail

rice prices remained higher than the maximum

retail prices imposed by the Government.

The average retail price of Samba rice was

Rs. 104.37 per kilogramme in 2020 compared to

Rs. 102.29 per kilogramme in 2019. Meanwhile,

the average retail price of Nadu rice increased to

Rs. 100.01 per kilogramme in 2020 in comparison to

Rs. 93.48 per kilogramme recorded in the previous

year. Further, rice imports declined to 15,770 metric

tons in 2020, registering a 34.8 per cent decline

over the previous year in response to higher

production and import control measures.

Tea

The production of tea registered a notable

decline of 7.1 per cent in 2020 due to adverse

weather conditions and labour supply

disruptions due to COVID-19 containment

measures. Although a significant decline of

18.0 per cent was recorded in the first half of the

year, tea production recovered in the second half of

the year, with a 4.9 per cent year-on-year growth.

Production of high, medium and low grown tea,

which contributes about 22 per cent, 17 per cent

and 61 per cent of the total production, respectively,

declined by 1.3 per cent, 0.9 per cent and

10.5 per cent, respectively, in 2020. In the meantime,

the average yield in the smallholder sector declined

from 1,765 kilogrammes per hectare, compared to

1,938 kilogrammes per hectare reported in 2019,

mainly due to the drought conditions that prevailed

in tea growing areas.

Tea prices at the Colombo Tea Auction

(CTA) remained elevated throughout the year

in comparison to the corresponding prices

in 2019. The average price of tea increased by

15.9 per cent to Rs. 633.85 per kilogramme during

2020, from Rs. 546.67 per kilogramme recorded

in the previous year. Average tea prices for high,

medium and low grown tea reported year-on-year

increases of 15.5 per cent, 18.7 per cent and

16.0 per cent, respectively, in 2020. Further, the

average price received by smallholders for green

leaves increased to Rs. 94.36 per kilogramme in

2020 from Rs. 80.15 per kilogramme in 2019. The

average export price (FOB) of tea increased by

1.6 per cent to US dollars 4.67 per kilogramme during

2020, compared to US dollars 4.60 per kilogramme

recorded in the preceding year. Although the increase

in tea prices can be partly attributed to the decline

in the quantity supplied to the CTA due to reduced

local production, a significant drop in tea exports from

global competitors due to setbacks caused by the

COVID-19 pandemic enabled domestic exporters to

attract a comparably higher price during 2020.

Rubber

Rubber production recorded an increase

of 4.6 per cent in 2020 largely due to attractive

market prices and favourable weather

conditions that prevailed in the second half of

the year. Although rubber production declined by

10.1 per cent in the first half of 2020 due to less

tapping days amidst mobility restrictions during

the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and dry

weather conditions in rubber growing areas, rubber

production improved considerably by 23.2 per cent

during the second half of the year, supported by

relatively favourable weather conditions. Among

the major categories of rubber produced, sheet

rubber production, which accounts for nearly

50 per cent of the total production, grew by 4.6 per cent

to 39.1 million kilogrammes. However, the production

of crepe rubber, which contributes 17 per cent of the

total rubber production, declined by 10.2 per cent

to 13.0 million kilogrammes in 2020. Meanwhile,

the production of unspecified categories of rubber,

which represents approximately 33 per cent of the

total production, recorded a significant increase

of 14.0 per cent to 26.1 million kilogrammes

during the year. In 2020, domestic consumption

of raw rubber in the Industrial sector decreased to

112.1 million kilogrammes, while total rubber

exports increased by 21.3 per cent, year-on-year, to

15.8 million kilogrammes.

Rubber prices increased at the Colombo

Rubber Auction, particularly towards the

end of the year, supported by the surge in

natural rubber prices in global markets. The

witnessed an increase of 21.8 per cent to

Rs. 351.46 per kilogramme in 2020, though RSS1

was not traded at the Colombo Rubber Auction

from April to August 2020 due to lower global

demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Average price of latex crepe increased by

18.8 per cent to Rs. 359.04 per kilogramme

during 2020. Meanwhile, average auction prices

of RSS1 and latex crepe stood at Rs. 440.00

per kilogramme and Rs. 462.17 per kilogramme,

respectively, in December 2020. Average FOB

price of rubber also registered an increase of

2.6 per cent to US dollars 1.91 per kilogramme

in 2020, in comparison to US dollars 1.86

per kilogramme in 2019. Recovery in Chinese demand

during the second half of 2020, lower production in

Thailand due to mobility restrictions and spread of

a fungal disease in rubber plantations in South East

Asia were the key reasons for the escalation of natural

rubber prices in global markets.

Coconut

The supply of coconut and coconut products

experienced a contraction in 2020. Coconut

production showed a notable decline of 9.5 per cent

in 2020, as a result of the lag effect of insufficient

rainfall received by major coconut growing areas

in 2019. The contraction in nut production and

supply side disturbances that emerged amidst the

COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted coconut

related industries. Accordingly, desiccated coconut

production declined substantially to 25,255 metric

tons in 2020 from 44,081 metric tons in 2019.

Due to the limited supply of fresh coconuts to oil

mills, coconut oil output also declined considerably

by 55.7 per cent to 19,759 metric tons, whereas

virgin coconut oil production increased by

18.1 per cent in 2020. Meanwhile, the importation

of coconut oil increased significantly to 79,060

metric tons in 2020 from 4,628 metric tons in 2019.

The Government adjusted the Special Commodity

Levy (SCL) on coconut oil, virgin coconut oil and

palm oil imports several times during 2020 with the

aim of supporting the domestic coconut oil industry.

Moreover, measures were taken to import sliced

dry copra instead of importing coconut oil, in order

to protect local oil manufacturers and to develop

coconut based industries. In comparison to 2019,

copra exports and fresh nut exports declined by

72.4 per cent and 25.2 per cent, respectively, in

2020. Despite the reduction in nut production,

coconut cream and coconut milk production grew

during 2020, though the production of coconut milk

powder recorded a decline.

Severe shortage of coconuts for

consumption and industrial usage due to

low domestic production resulted in prices

of coconut and coconut based products

escalating in 2020. Accordingly, average retail

price of coconut increased significantly by

45.8 per cent to Rs. 73.82 per nut compared to

the preceding year. The average auction price

of coconut at the Colombo Coconut Auction also

increased to Rs. 48.89 per nut from Rs. 27.55 per

nut in 2019. The increase in market price of fresh

coconuts pushed up the cost of coconut based

products. Accordingly, average price of coconut

oil increased significantly by 31.9 per cent to

Rs. 343.18 per 750 ml bottle in 2020, while the

average local market price of desiccated coconut

also increased to Rs. 447.56 per kilogramme in

2020 from Rs. 251.03 per kilogramme in 2019.

Further, a 36.5 per cent decline in desiccated

coconut exports was observed while export price

of desiccated coconut increased by 37.3 per cent

during the year. Although the Government imposed

maximum retail prices for coconuts in September

2020, ranging from Rs. 60.00 to Rs. 70.00 per nut

based on the circumference of coconuts, coconuts

were sold above the controlled prices in local

markets due to limited supply.

Minor Export Crops

According to the provisional estimates of

the Department of Export Agriculture (DEA), the

performance of minor export crops rebounded

in 2020, registering a 23.6 per cent growth. The

production of ginger, turmeric, cinnamon, pepper,

cocoa, cardamom, and arecanut increased during

the year, while the production of clove and nutmeg

declined. Due to the import restrictions imposed

by the Government on export agriculture crop

products such as ginger, pepper and turmeric,

farmers showed a significant interest in cultivating

such crops. Accordingly, raw turmeric production at

25,506 metric tons in 2020, recorded a remarkable

growth of 170.9 per cent, while production of ginger

increased by 64.7 per cent to 22,705 metric tons.

Pepper production also increased by 8.2 per cent to

23,970 metric tons during the year. The production

of cinnamon increased marginally to 20,866 metric

tons in 2020, while the production of arecanut grew

by 15.7 per cent to 20,526 metric tons. Meanwhile,

the production of clove and nutmeg declined by

26.6 per cent and 46.3 per cent to 3,512 metric tons

and 2,751 metric tons, respectively, in 2020, owing

to the belated harvesting period due to delayed

crop cycles.

Other Field Crops

Restrictions imposed on the importation

of certain other field crops (OFCs) led to a

notable increase in local production, with local

producers receiving premium prices.

Accordingly, the overall production of OFCs

increased by 21.7 per cent, year-on-year, to

664,380 metric tons in 2020. This was the

combined outcome of a growth of 13.8 per cent in

the 2019/2020 Maha season and a 38.2 per cent

growth in the 2020 Yala season. The output of

maize, finger millet (kurakkan), big onion, red onion,

green gram, black gram, ground nut, sorghum,

and cowpea increased in 2020, compared to the

previous year. Meanwhile, big onion production,

which declined by 33.7 per cent in 2019,

bounced back with a significant growth of 131.2

per cent during the year. However, importation

of big onions increased by 10.7 per cent to

265,863 metric tons in 2020. Moreover, potato

production declined by 36.0 per cent to 65,085

metric tons in 2020 and potato imports also dropped

by 10.8 per cent. It is expected that the improved

local supply of OFCs would support domestic

industries that use such produce, dampening

the demand for imports. In order to strengthen

domestic food security, further efforts are required

to improve the supply of all OFCs by promoting

seed production, pest management, expanding

storage capacity, adopting best practices on

climate resilient agriculture and increasing access

to diverse markets for better price realisation.

Vegetables

According to the estimates of the DCS,

vegetable production increased to 1.7 million

metric tons in 2020, registering a growth of

13.0 per cent despite COVID-19 related supply

chain interruptions. This increase was supported

by a 7.0 per cent increase in production in the

2019/2020 Maha season and a 20.7 per cent

growth in the 2020 Yala season. However,

there were wide fluctuations in vegetable

prices throughout the year owing to supply

chain disruptions caused by COVID-19 related

lockdowns and mobility restrictions. Therefore,

agricultural produce was transported to economic

centres with delays, resulting in comparatively high

post-harvest losses at the farm gate and economic

centres, creating frequent price fluctuations in

retail markets. Meanwhile, 33,206 metric tons

of vegetables worth US dollars 36.6 million were

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2020

44

exported, while 716,494 metric tons of vegetables

worth US dollars 352.9 million were imported during

2020. Improving storage and distribution, optimal

usage of agricultural inputs such as fertiliser

and pesticides, and adopting climate smart and

sustainable agricultural practices have become

imperative to ensure higher incomes for farmers,

protect consumers and increase the sustainability

of the sector.

Fruits

The production of fruits increased in 2020

by 3.1 per cent compared to the decline of

3.1 per cent recorded in the previous

year, with significant improvements in the

production of mango, banana, papaw, guava,

and melon. During the year under review, 38,725

metric tons of fruits worth US dollars 33.1 million

were exported, while 52,778 metric tons of fruits,

including apples, mandarins, oranges and grapes,

valued at US dollars 58.1 million were imported.

Despite good export demand for local fruits and

vegetables, the inability to supply large quantities

of good quality products on a continuous basis by

the local producers was a major constraint for the

development of the fruit export sector. Promoting

good agricultural practices, especially with regard

to the usage of agricultural inputs and harvesting,

establishing direct links between producers and

exporters, and further development of the contract

farming system are key to improving fruit exports.

Sugar

The production of sugar increased by

14.5 per cent to 59,869 metric tons in 2020,

supported by increased extent cultivated

and the quantity of cane crushed. The

production at Gal Oya and Sevenagala sugar

factories increased by 81.3 per cent and

0.6 per cent to 20,173 metric tons and 16,114

metric tons, respectively. However, output

at Pelwatte sugar factory, which accounts

for around 39 per cent of the total domestic

sugar production, declined by 6.3 per cent to

23,582 metric tons in 2020 owing to low yield

caused by dry weather conditions and low

sugar recovery rate.4 Negotiations on the

re-establishment of the Kantale sugar factory

and the sugarcane plantation progressed during

the year. Meanwhile, a new sugar factory under

Ethimale plantations (Pvt) Ltd. commenced

sugarcane cultivation with a view to launching

manufacturing operations in the near future.

Overall, the sugar recovery rate declined to

6.8 per cent in 2020 from 7.2 per cent in the

previous year, and domestic sugar production

in 2020 was sufficient to meet around 9 per cent

of the total sugar requirement of the country.

Sugar imports increased by 22.7 per cent to

682,553 metric tons in 2020, especially after the

reduction of the SCL on sugar imports in October

2020. Considering the potential for the expansion

of the domestic sugar production and the

significant amount of foreign exchange incurred

in importing sugar, it is crucial to revitalise the

sugar industry with the use of modern technology,

high yielding sugar cane varieties and better crop

management practices.

Livestock

Output in the domestic livestock sector

declined in 2020, except for milk production.

According to the estimates of the DCS, the total

national milk production increased notably by

9.8 per cent, year-on-year, to 492 million litres in

2020. The increase in production can be attributed

to farmers receiving attractive prices for raw milk,

growing demand for raw milk from milk collectors

and part time farmers actively involved in animal

rearing during the pandemic period. The average

cost of production of a litre of milk was Rs. 49.28,

which was an increase from Rs. 48.32 reported

in 2019. With regard to the poultry sector, egg

production declined by 10.3 per cent in 2020 due

to production losses resulting from early culling of

commercial layers and limited availability of feed

material. Further, as per the provisional data of

the Department of Animal Production and Health

(DAPH), poultry meat production decreased by

3.5 per cent to 216,160 metric tons. Local

production of broiler parents recorded an increase

while the importation of broiler parents declined

during 2020 due to restrictions imposed on live

animal importation, resulting in lower availability

of broiler day-old chicks in 2020. However, the

importation of layer parents increased, in response

to high demand for layer chicks for egg production.

Meanwhile, the production of beef, pork and

mutton declined by 54.5 per cent, 4.7 per cent and

11.0 per cent, respectively, to 13,580 metric

tons, 8,580 metric tons and 1,610 metric

tons, respectively, in 2020. Reduced demand

from the leisure sector and the curtailment of

social activities with the onset of the pandemic

contributed negatively to the performance of the

domestic livestock sector.

Fisheries

The fisheries sector experienced a setback

in 2020. The total fish production declined by

15.2 per cent in 2020, mainly due to a decline

in marine fish production, which accounts for

76 per cent in total fish production. A considerable

contraction in deep sea and coastal fishing

activities was experienced due to frequent weather

disturbances and restrictions imposed on fishing

and other supply chain activities during the

pandemic, especially with the emergence of a

COVID-19 cluster within the fish supply chain. In

contrast, the total inland fish production witnessed

a growth of 12.7 per cent supported by the inland

capture and the shrimp farm production. Improved

practices of stocking and releasing of fingerlings

into inland water bodies contributed to a notable

increase in the inland fisheries production.

Meanwhile, the domestic fish consumption of the

household and hotel sectors, which was affected

by the domestic and global lockdown measures,

and the fear about fish being a carrier of the virus,

resulted in volatile prices throughout the year. In

terms of prices, on average, large fish varieties

recorded a marginal decline of 0.4 per cent

while small fish varieties recorded an increase of

19.2 per cent during the year. Meanwhile, seafood

exports witnessed a decline of 29.5 per cent during

2020, as a result of lower demand from key export

destinations and the disturbances to global logistic

chains.

Agriculture Policies and Institutional Support

The Government introduced several

measures to enhance paddy production and

stabilise paddy prices. Accordingly, under the

fertiliser subsidy programme, fertiliser was issued

to farmers at a subsidised price of Rs. 500.00

per 50 kilogrammes bag in the 2019/2020 Maha

season. Accordingly, around 193,322 metric tons

of fertiliser were issued to paddy farmers during the

said season. Moreover, the Government decided to

provide fertiliser free of charge for paddy farmers for

a maximum land extent of two hectares from 2020

Yala season onwards and 131,309 metric tons of

fertiliser were issued in the 2020 Yala season. In

order to ensure that the paddy farmers receive a

remunerative price and to stabilise paddy market

prices, the Government took steps to implement

the paddy purchasing programme at a guaranteed

price. The Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) purchased

around 26,000 metric tons of paddy stocks from

the 2019/2020 Maha harvest, but only around

4,000 metric tons were purchased in the 2020 Yala

season since the prevailing market prices were

higher than the guaranteed price offered by the PMB.

Meanwhile, the Rice Research and Development

Institute (RRDI) developed new hybrid short duration

rice varieties with drought resistant modifications.

Moreover, the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA)

continued its support services including extension

services, crop insurance and pest management,

while implementing a special mid-season cultivation

programme, popularising climate smart agricultural

practices.

The Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB), Tea Small

Holdings Development Authority (TSHDA) and

the Tea Research Institute (TRI) continued their

development activities aimed at productivity

and technological enhancements. During the

pandemic period, the tea auction was shifted

from the conventional physical presence system

to an e-auction platform where buyers were

able to bid from remote locations. Accordingly,

over 200 million kilogrammes of tea were sold

through e-auctions during the period under review.

Meanwhile, the Government decided to increase

the daily wage of the plantation sector workers up to

Rs. 1,000.00 through the Wages Board in order to

resolve prolonged wage issues in the sector. The

SLTB initiated a Model Tea Garden project for

middle scale tea estates by providing Rs. 1 million

per acre of model tea gardens. Under the Tea

Sector Revival and Modernisation Programme of

the SLTB, Rs. 168 million was granted to 56 tea

factories in 2020. The TSHDA continued its efforts

on tea replanting and new planting programmes

and crop rehabilitation subsidy programmes. In

2020, around 648 hectares of tea lands were

replanted and about 424 hectares of new lands

were converted into tea lands, whilst 2.1 million tea

plants were used for infilling vacancies in tea lands.

Several measures were implemented by

the Rubber Development Department (RDD)

and the Rubber Research Institute (RRI) to

improve productivity and to expand the extent

of rubber cultivation. Accordingly, 720 hectares

of new rubber cultivations were established under

the new planting programme in 2020. Meanwhile,

815 hectares of land were improved under the

productivity improvement programme while 955

hectares were replanted during the year. In 2020,

300 hectares of untapped land were brought to the

tapping stage. Meanwhile, the subsidy for fixing

a rain guard per tree was increased for both the

smallholder sector and the corporate sector in 2020.

The RRI continued its research and development

on all aspects of rubber cultivation, processing and

product development. Accordingly, the RRI initiated

special development programmes for rubber

growers under four categories, namely, small

scale growers, medium scale growers, regional

plantation companies / estates and growers who

have abandoned tapping. The RRI carried out

activities related to the upgrading and accrediting

of technological laboratories of rubber, promoting

slow release fertiliser technology and promoting

of the rubber industry as an environmentally

sustainable industry.

The Government implemented several

measures in the coconut sector to support the

nut production and coconut based industries.

Drought conditions and supply chain disturbances

caused by mobility restrictions, such as increased

wastage due to market closures, labour shortage

and logistic difficulties, adversely affected the

coconut sector in 2020. Therefore, the Coconut

Development Authority (CDA) took steps to

continue production activities amid containment

measures while minimising the impact of

COVID-19 on the coconut sector. The CDA

initiated e-auction facilities to enable a continuous

exchange process and to maintain reasonable

price levels. Activities such as the introduction of

a general subsidised price for coconut seedlings

(Rs. 100.00 per plant) for systematic cultivation

and home gardening, provision of financial support

to implement a systematic irrigation system and

control of pests and diseases, and conducting

of training programmes were undertaken by the

Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB) with a view

to establishing sustainable coconut cultivation

strategies. Meanwhile, the Coconut Research

Institute (CRI) introduced a new coconut hybrid

variety (CRISL 2020) with high yielding and early

flowering traits, while taking steps to establish a

new coconut seed garden jointly with Kurunegala

Plantations Ltd., to produce a high yielding

Kapsuwaya hybrid coconut cultivar.

The DEA supported stakeholders of the

export agriculture sector, including growers,

collectors, processors and exporters, in

various ways amid the COVID-19 outbreak.

Accordingly, several measures were introduced

to increase the production of export agriculture

crops by expanding new planting activities while

improving the yield of existing cultivations. The

DEA implemented several crop value addition

programmes to motivate pepper farmers, while

an ‘accelerated turmeric cultivation development

programme’ was also initiated with the aim of

achieving self-sufficiency in turmeric by 2021.

The Food Production National Programme

(FPNP) for the period 2020-2022 focuses on

several targets, including making the country

self-sufficient in crops such as maize, onion

and potato through crop diversification and

productivity improvements. Accordingly, the

Department of Agriculture continued its efforts to

popularise Good Agricultural Practices (GAP),

expand the extent under cultivation of OFCs,

ensure soil conservation, improve efficient crop

management techniques, and ensure high yielding

seeds usage and improve water management.

Moreover, the MOA continued the Nutrition Sensitive

Home Gardening programme and the Cluster Village

Development programme under the FPNP, with the

aim of developing the production of OFCs. However,

the country needs to adopt a well coordinated

and comprehensive approach towards increasing

productivity in relation to all food categories through

efficient agricultural input usage, climate smart

practices and post-harvest practices, rather than

attempting to achieve food self-sufficiency only by

increasing the land extent cultivated.

During the year, the Sugarcane Research

Institute (SRI) carried out several research

activities and extension services aimed

at enhancing domestic sugar production.

Accordingly, the SRI started a programme to introduce

imported sugarcane varieties with high sugar content

for commercial cultivation. Further, steps have been

taken to expand sugarcane cultivation in Kilinochchi,

mainly for jaggery and syrup production. The SRI

extended its technical information and assistance

to new investors to establish new sugar factories at

Vavuniya and Welioya.

The DAPH implemented several development

programmes in 2020 to improve the national

livestock population and productivity. Under

the Livestock (Dairy) Breeding Project, the

implementation of artificial insemination services,

strengthening and maintenance of artificial

insemination centres, progeny testing of bull-calves

for natural breeding and pasture development

programmes were conducted to upgrade the

existing cattle population in order to increase

domestic milk production. Accordingly, 202,516

artificial inseminations were carried out on cattle

and buffalos through divisional veterinary offices in

2020. Institutional support for the livestock sector

development was continued through the Field

Veterinary Services Improvement programme.

Further, 410,459 animals were immunised

against Foot and Mouth disease, 178,243 animals

were immunised against Black Quarter disease

and 279,407 animals were immunised against

Haemorrhagic Septicaemia in 2020, under the

Control of Contagious and Infectious Diseases

Project.

Policy measures of the Government for the

fisheries sector underlined the necessity to

increase fish production against the backdrop

of emerging challenges. The National Aquaculture

Development Authority (NAQDA) continued its

efforts to increase inland fish production through

proper management of water bodies and stock

enhancements. Construction work of Dambulla

freshwater fish genetic development centre, which

was aimed at producing high quality brood stock,

increasing fish seed quality and developing new

strains of indigenous species, was completed in

2020. During the period under review, the NAQDA

stocked 77.7 million freshwater prawn post larvae

and 92.9 million fingerlings in water bodies.

Moreover, steps were taken to promote the export-

oriented fisheries sector, including the initiation of

an ornamental fish breeding centre in Polonnaruwa,

the establishment of two crab cities in Hambantota,

the commencement of large scale sea bass

farming in Trincomalee, and the establishment of

sea cucumber export villages in Kilinochchi and

49

Jaffna. In addition, the construction of a milkfish

hatchery in Puttalam was commenced. The NAQDA

took steps to intensify the shrimp culture activity in the

North Western Province through the introduction of a

water recirculation system and enhanced biosecurity

of farming areas. However, lack of investment, low

adoption of modern fishing technologies, delays in

obtaining land and sea area on lease for aquaculture

projects and low value addition in exports remain as

barriers for the expansion in the fisheries sector.

Industry

Reflecting the adverse impacts of the

COVID-19 pandemic, mainly on construction,

manufacturing, and mining and quarrying

activities, Industry activities contracted by

6.9 per cent in 2020 in value added terms,

compared to the growth of 2.6 per cent recorded

in 2019. The adverse impacts of the pandemic on the

major export markets also spilled over to Sri Lanka,

weakening the demand, especially for textile and

wearing apparel related manufacturing activities.

In the meantime, electricity, gas, steam and air

conditioning supply activities, and sewerage, waste

treatment and disposal activities slightly contracted

during the year. However, water collection, treatment

and supply activities contributed positively towards

the Industry activities in 2020. Reflecting the

contraction in Industry activities, the Demand and

Production sub-indices related to the Industry sector

of the Business Outlook Survey (BOS) conducted by

the Central Bank on a quarterly basis, declined on

average during the year.

Manufacturing

Owing to the pandemic related disturbances,

the value addition from manufacturing

activities recorded a contraction of 3.9 per

cent in 2020, compared to the growth of 1.8 per

cent recorded in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic,

which first spread in Sri Lanka in mid-March 2020

and the subsequent imposition of strict restrictions

to contain it, adversely affected the manufacturing

activities, particularly during the first half of the

year. Apart from that, being a global pandemic,

the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 on major

trading economies also spilled over to the Sri

Lankan economy. Weaker external demand as

well as disturbances to the global supply-chain of

inputs further deteriorated the capacity utilisation

and volume produced in manufacturing firms as a

whole. Accordingly, a significant contraction was

observed in the manufacturing of textiles, wearing

apparel and leather-related products, the second

largest sub-activity of manufacturing, especially

during the second quarter. Further, the contraction

recorded in most of the other manufacturing sub-

activities also contributed to the overall contraction

of manufacturing activities in 2020. However,

manufacturing of food, beverages and tobacco

products, which is the largest sub-activity of

manufacturing, recorded a growth during the year.

Considering the manufacturing-related indicators,

the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) compiled

by the DCS recorded a decline in 2020. Further,

reflecting the adverse impact of the first wave of

the COVID-19 pandemic on the manufacturing

activities, the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI)

for manufacturing activities, compiled by the Central

Bank on a monthly basis, recorded its historically

lowest index value in April 2020, which subsequently

indicated signs of recovery from the third quarter

onwards.

Index of Industrial Production

Although occasional shutdowns across

key manufacturing sectors, due to the spread

of COVID-19, led to a significant decline in the

overall annual performance of the Index of

Industrial Production (IIP), a notable recovery

was observed in the second half of the year. As

reflected in the IIP, manufacturing sector activities

contracted by 10.2 per cent in 2020 compared to

an expansion of 1.3 per cent recorded in 2019.

While manufacturing activities across certain key

sub-sectors deteriorated during 2020, the

manufacture of food products, and basic

pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical

preparations, and printing and reproduction of

recorded media sub-sectors recorded an expansion

in activity. The expansion recorded in the categories

of food products and basic pharmaceutical

products was driven by the essential nature of

these sectors during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Although manufacturing activities experienced

significant disruptions during the second quarter

of 2020 due to the nationwide lockdown and

other mobility restrictions to curtail the spread of

COVID-19, manufacturing activities returned to

pre-pandemic levels by July 2020 with the easing

of mobility restrictions and gradual restoration of

normalcy to the economy. Notably, the marginal

contraction recorded in the IIP during the third and

fourth quarters were largely driven by the wearing

apparel sector that suffered from several setbacks,

including COVID-19 outbreaks in factories. Amid

these setbacks, manufacturing activities recorded

a positive performance, on a year-on-year basis, in

December 2020 despite the contractions recorded

in October and November 2020.

Although the disruptions caused by the

COVID-19 pandemic had a lesser impact on the

food manufacturing sector due to the essential

nature of the products, beverage manufacturing

activities experienced a contraction during

2020. During 2020, the manufacture of food

products sub-sector, the largest sub-sector

in the IIP, recorded a growth of 3.3 per cent

largely driven by the essential nature of food

products and increased demand due to consumer

stockpiling during the pandemic. The sector’s

positive performance was driven by the increased

production of milk powder, wheat flour, yoghurt and

biscuits. In contrast, the manufacture of beverages

sub-sector recorded a contraction of 6.7 per cent

during the year on account of reduced production

of beer, arrack and soft drinks. The closure of

restaurants and liquor shops, low demand from the

hotel sector and subdued leisure activities adversely

affected beverage manufacturing. However, during

the second half of 2020, beverage manufacturing

activities recorded a substantial growth of

11.5 per cent with the resurgence of economic

activity compared to the 23.9 per cent contraction

during the first half of 2020. The recovery of the sector

during the second half of the year is significant when

weighed against the minor expansion of 1.8 per cent

recorded in the corresponding period of 2019.

The disruptions in global supply chains,

limited availability of labour owing to domestic

mobility restrictions together with poor local

availability of raw materials adversely affected

the manufacturing of wearing apparel and

textiles industries in 2020. As reflected in the IIP,

the manufacture of wearing apparel sector recorded

a contraction of 30.8 per cent in 2020, compared to a

growth of 1.9 per cent recorded in the previous year,

largely due to COVID-19 containment measures

and decline in orders from export destinations. The

nationwide lockdown measures imposed throughout

the month of April resulted in the sector sharply

contracting during the month. However, with factories

gradually returning to normal operational levels from

the latter part of May, a strong rebound was observed

in the manufacturing performance of the sector

with occasional declines due to the second wave of

infections, which resulted in several short closures

within the sector. Decline in the wearing apparel

sector was limited to a certain extent with several

key apparel producers shifting to the production of

personal protective equipment (PPE) targeting the

United States and European markets. Although the

manufacture of textiles sector recorded an overall

contraction during the year, the sector grew by

11.9 per cent in the second half of 2020 signalling

the restoration of normalcy to economic activity

and diversification of production lines to cater to

new demands arising from the health sector, PPE

products in particular. The increased production

of finished fabrics, coir fibre and printing of fabrics

largely contributed to the growth momentum in the

second half of 2020.

Although the manufacture of other

non-metallic mineral products, the manufacture

of basic metals and the manufacture of

fabricated metal products sub-sectors

registered overall contractions in 2020,

some signs of recovery were observed

in the second half of the year. The decline

in the production of floor tiles, porcelain

tableware and glass bottles largely contributed

to the slowdown in the manufacture of other

non-metallic mineral products sub-sector. Subdued

demand from the local construction sector and

global markets along with import restrictions,

contributed to reduced production in the other non-

metallic mineral products sub-sector. The decline

in the production of lead and aluminium bars, owing

to subdued demand, contributed to the overall

contraction of the manufacture of basic metals and

the manufacture of fabricated metal products sub-

sectors.

The manufacture of coke and refined

petroleum products sub-sector witnessed

a contraction of 20.3 per cent during the

first half of 2020, but recorded a growth of

1.6 per cent during the second half of the year.

The initial decline could be attributed to the decline

in production of petrol, auto diesel, furnace oil,

and bitumen stemming from reduced demand for

refined petroleum products in the domestic market

and the partial closure of the Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation (CPC) refinery for 45 days since 15

February 2020.

The manufacture of tobacco products

sub-sector continued to remain subdued in

2020. Accordingly, the manufacture of tobacco

products sub-sector recorded a contraction of

11.0 per cent during 2020, following the

contractionary trend observed in 2018 and 2019.

The high level of taxes on tobacco products and

muted consumer demand stemming from the

COVID-19 outbreak resulted in a reduction in the

manufacture of tobacco products in 2020.

The manufacture of rubber and plastic

products, leather and related products, and

chemicals and chemical products sub-sectors

contracted in 2020. The decline in the production

of rubber sheets, plastic bottles, tyres, rubber

bottles and zippers, that cater to international

markets, underpinned the slowdown experienced

in the rubber and plastic products sub-sector.

Leather and related products sub-sector recorded

a contraction of 33.5 per cent in 2020 caused by

a decline in production of finished leather, leather

bags, school shoes and leather jackets. Although

the manufacture of chemicals and chemical

products sub-sector witnessed a contraction of

23.2 per cent in the first half of 2020 due to the

decline in production of paints, fertiliser and

poly bags, the sector recorded an expansion of

6.7 per cent in the second half of 2020, with the

revival of economic activity with the easing of

nationwide lockdown measures.

The manufacture of basic pharmaceutical

products and pharmaceutical preparations

sub-sector witnessed an expansion in 2020. In

response to the increased demand for medicines

and other health related products following the

COVID-19 outbreak, notable increases were

observed in the production of capsules and

Ayurvedic balms. This sub-sector is expected

to continue its growth momentum with the

2

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE, INCOME AND EMPLOYMENT

53

Government’s goal of meeting half of local medicine

demand through local production by 2024. The

Government’s commitment to support indigenous

medicine sector, domestic pharmaceutical

manufacturing and establishing new pharmaceutical

manufacturing zones in Hambantota, Anuradhapura

and Horana is expected to support the industry in the

period ahead.

The IIP sub-sectors relating to the

manufacture of paper and paper products, and

wood products (except furniture), electrical

equipment, machinery and equipment, and

furniture recorded subdued performance in

2020. On account of the decline in the production

of corrugated paper, cardboard boxes, paper

bags and exercise books, the manufacture of

paper and paper products sub-sector weakened

in 2020. Despite the growing consumer base and

the increased penetration of locally produced

electronic goods in the consumer durables

segment, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the

growth momentum of the manufacture of electrical

equipment and furniture during the year.

Industrial Policies and Institutional Support

The activities of government agencies

overseeing industrial activities continued

albeit at a slower pace amidst the COVID-19

outbreak in 2020. The State Ministry of Skills

Development, Vocational Education, Research

and Innovation, and the Ministry of Environment

were in the process of finalising the National

Policy on Mineral Resources. The policy is

expected to create an enabling environment for

mineral-based industries to expand their scope for

value addition. In collaboration with the Ministry of

Foreign Employment, the State Ministry of Skills

Development, Vocational Education, Research

and Innovation also undertook measures to

expand vocational education opportunities to cater

to the changing needs of the domestic and foreign

job markets. Further, the Ministry successfully

conducted the National Technology and Innovation

Exhibition – Inno Tech 2020 in March 2020 in

Homagama. The exhibition sought to promote

science literacy among all social segments. The

State Ministry also began the Multi-Purpose

Development Task Force training programme

through the National Apprentice and Industrial

Training Authority (NAITA) for 100,000 unskilled

individuals from low-income households who had

been provided public sector employment. In the

meantime, the Ministry of Industries developed

Standard Operating Procedure guidelines for

the automobile manufacturing, assembling and

manufacturing of spare parts industry in Sri

Lanka with the assistance of relevant government

agencies, leading industrialists, and professionals

in the sector. At the beginning of 2021, the Cabinet

of Ministers granted approval to implement the

provisions outlined in the said guidelines.

Intending to create a production economy,

several other government authorities

also undertook measures to promote and

strengthen the domestic industrial sector.

The National Enterprise Development Authority

(NEDA) established an E-Commerce Trade

Portal in 2020 to facilitate market access for

Micro, Small and Medium scale entrepreneurs

(MSMEs). This project is expected to enhance

market access of scattered and isolated

entrepreneurs and to modernise their enterprises

through the integration of their activities on

an online platform. The NEDA also conducted

several short-term capacity development training,

financial assistance, market facilitation, and other

enterprise development services islandwide. In

2020, the NEDA trained 4,855 entrepreneurs and

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2020

54

implemented cluster development programmes

for several selected industrial clusters. The

National Productivity Secretariat continued to

conduct productivity enhancement programmes for

small scale entrepreneurs. Further, the NEDA took

measures to establish incubation and technology

transfer centres in each province, while launching

a ‘Made in Sri Lanka’ logo to affirm the domestic

origins and authenticity of products. Meanwhile,

the Industrial Development Board (IDB) in

collaboration with the Ministry of Industries and a

state bank, launched the ‘Made in Sri Lanka’ loans

programme in keeping with the Government’s

national policy framework that aims to support

domestic industries with greater potential for

export, import substitution, domestic value addition,

and employment generation. This loan programme

is expected to boost the development of local

export-oriented and import alternative industries,

while improving the quality of local products. The

IDB is expected to provide necessary technical

and managerial support, while the state bank

provides specialised financial support to ensure

the sustainability of their businesses. As at end

2020, around 600 MSMEs were registered for this

special loan scheme. The IDB also established an

accredited food laboratory at Katubedda with the

assistance of the Ministry of Industries, focusing

on the testing and development of new products

to promote small and medium scale domestic food

manufacturers. Around 112 small and medium scale

industrialists were facilitated through this project,

while providing laboratory reports for 246 samples

of food products. Meanwhile, during the year, the

Industrial Technology Institute (ITI) developed

twenty herbal-based products and ten food-based

products to cater to novel needs arising from

COVID-19. Technology developed in relation to the

manufacturing of hand sanitiser was transferred

from ITI to small business industries. The Sri Lanka

Institute of Nanotechnology (SLINTEC) has filed

fifteen patents up to now and seven patents are in

the pipeline for 2020/21. The SLINTEC evaluated

over 100 research projects in 2020 giving priority to

revenue generating projects.

Several initiatives were underway by Industrial

Chambers and other relevant institutions to

promote the domestic industrial sector amidst

disruptions caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.

The National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka

(NCCSL) continued its endeavour to educate and

uplift MSMEs by conducting training programmes in

2020. The NCCSL took a major step in introducing

a digital B2B (business-to-business) platform that

connects Sri Lankan exporters with global markets.

The NCCSL also continued to work on MSME

development activities at both the district and

provincial levels, addressing key entrepreneurial

issues, including access to finance, markets and

technology. The NCCSL entered into several

Memoranda of Understanding with industry

associations and provincial chambers to enhance

cooperation across several different business sectors.

Meanwhile, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce

(CCC) continued to facilitate trade related training

programmes, webinars and trade fora to promote

trade and investment, while submitting several

proposals to the Government on accelerating

economic recovery. The CCC conducted a series

of webinars to educate, empower and boost the

confidence of COVID-19 affected businesses,

MSMEs and entrepreneurs. The CCC also launched

the ‘Trade Watch’ web page, a dedicated page to

keep the private sector updated on trade services

offered by key government agencies in the wake of

COVID-19.

The Export Development Board (EDB) of

Sri Lanka and the Board of Investment (BOI)

undertook various measures to ensure the

continuity of business operations of enterprises

amidst the lockdown. The EDB established a

2

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE, INCOME AND EMPLOYMENT

55

24-hour help desk to address queries relating

to operations during the lockdown period. The

EDB intervened to facilitate cargo movements

throughout the lockdown period in coordination

with relevant authorities. Also, the EDB proactively

coordinated with Sri Lanka Missions overseas

by organising weekly online meetings with the

Foreign Ministry to share quick intelligence

reports with exporters on new opportunities.

The EDB also facilitated the procurement of

essential raw materials for certified export orders

by establishing an online mechanism to submit

applications. The EDB established online B2B

promotions and regular webinars to educate

exporters and MSMEs on branding, marketing,

and financial issues. Meanwhile, with the

imposition of travel restrictions, which directly had

an impact on both inward and outward promotion

missions, the BOI moved its promotional strategy

to virtual platforms. Permission was granted for

BOI enterprises to engage in additional product

lines to cater to the changing and rising demand

for certain products as a result of the COVID-19

pandemic. In 2020, the BOI granted approvals

for 50 companies to engage in the production of

PPEs as an additional activity. The BOI, as the

facilitator for zonal enterprises, undertook various

measures to assist businesses in recommencing

their operations during the lockdown period

by obtaining the necessary approvals from

relevant authorities. The BOI also implemented

a paperless import and export documentation

process for BOI exporters, in consultation with

Sri Lanka Customs. To enhance the domestic

value addition of rubber-based manufacturing,

the BOI facilitated two key projects, which are

expected to attract foreign direct investment of

US dollars 550 million. The first phase of a project

on producing passenger car radial tyres was

completed during 2020 with realised investment

of US dollars 100 million, and operations

commenced in January 2021. Phase two of the

same project is expected to be completed by

mid-March 2022. In the meantime, an agreement

was signed in November 2020 towards

constructing a tyre manufacturing plant on a

land extent of 121 acres within the Hambantota

International Port. This project is expected to

attract foreign direct investment of US dollars

300 million.

The Government, in collaboration with

the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, introduced

an expansive relief package including debt

relief, debt moratorium, and working capital

loan facilities to SMEs, self-employed

persons, and individuals severely affected

by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Central

Bank introduced the ‘Saubhagya COVID-19

Renaissance Loan Scheme Facility’ in three

phases to provide working capital loans to

businesses adversely affected by COVID-19

related disruptions. Under this facility, the

Central Bank provides funds to participating

banks at a concessionary interest rate and this is

on-lent by commercial banks at an interest rate of

4 per cent per annum, with a repayment period

of 24 months, inclusive of a grace period of

6 months. By the end of the year, 59,854 loan

applications received from COVID-19 affected

businesses, for a sum of Rs. 173.9 billion had

been approved. Further, the Small and Medium

Enterprise Line of Credit Scheme and the Rooftop

Solar Power Generation Line of Credit Scheme

funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB)

continued in 2020. By the end of 2020, Rs. 32.8

billion had been granted under these two credit

schemes. Further, the total government subsidy

payments for the ‘Enterprise Sri Lanka’ loan

programme amounted to Rs. 6.0 billion in 2020.

Construction, and Mining and Quarrying

Health-related concerns severely affected

the performance of construction, and mining

and quarrying activities leading these activities

to contract by 13.2 per cent and 12.5 per cent,

respectively, in 2020, which grew by 4.0 per cent

and 2.8 per cent, respectively, in 2019. Mining

and quarrying activities mainly include mining

activities that provide inputs to the construction

activities such as sand mining, other than gem

mining and other mining activities. The setback

in construction activities, owing to the adverse

impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related

restrictions on mobility, had mainly contributed to

the contraction in mining and quarrying activities.

The contraction in construction activities was

reflected in the total cement availability of the

country, which recorded a significant contraction of

11.5 per cent in 2020. Moreover, building material

imports also contracted, partly due to the policy

measures adopted to encourage import substitution

industries. However, this in turn increased the

demand for local supplies. Meanwhile, a recovery in

construction activities and hence in mining activities

was observed during the latter part of the year.

Indicating this recovery, credit to the private sector

granted by Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) for

construction activities, including personal housing

construction activities, recorded a considerable

growth as at the end of December 2020,

supported by the low interest rate environment.

Meanwhile, the construction sector related

business surveys conducted by the Central Bank

demonstrated that most of the construction firms

experienced a subdued performance, especially

during the second quarter of the year, due to the

health-related concerns that arose with the

pandemic.

Electricity, Water and Waste Treatment

With the subdued performance in the

economy, the value added of electricity, water,

and waste treatment activities contracted

marginally by 0.8 per cent in 2020 compared

to the growth of 4.9 per cent recorded in 2019.

Among the sub-economic activities within the

category, the largest activity of electricity, gas,

steam and air conditioning supply contracted by

1.6 per cent in 2020 compared to the growth of

4.0 per cent recorded in 2019. Considering electricity

generation data, the total electricity generation

recorded a marginal contraction in 2020, largely

driven by the decrease in demand for electricity

from the industry sector with a low level of economic

activities, especially during the second quarter of

the year. With regard to the other sub-economic

activities within the category, the value added of

water collection, treatment and supply activities

grew by 4.8 per cent in 2020, while sewerage,

waste treatment and disposal activities recorded a

contraction of 1.0 per cent during the year.

Services

The COVID-19 pandemic had a positive

impact on some Services activities, especially

related to IT and telecommunication, while it

caused severe disturbances to mobility and

tourism-related activities leading to an overall

contraction in Services in 2020 by 1.5 per cent in

value added terms, in comparison to the growth

of 2.2 per cent recorded in 2019. The pandemic

particularly affected tourism-related services

activities as tourist arrivals dropped drastically since

mid-March 2020 due to restrictions imposed on

arrivals. Accordingly, transportation, other personal

services, and accommodation, food and beverage

service activities which were severely interrupted by

restrictions on mobility, were the largest contributors

2

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE, INCOME AND EMPLOYMENT

57

to the contraction in overall Services activities.

However, IT programming and telecommunication

services benefitted from the boost in demand for

digital platforms and communication services.

Further, financial services, wholesale and retail

trade, human health, public administration and

education services expanded during the year.

Reflecting the overall subdued performance in

Services activities caused by the pandemic, the

PMI for Services activities, compiled by the Central

Bank indicated a contraction on a month-on-month

basis during the months where the COVID-19

pandemic severely affected the country. Further, the

Demand and Sales sub-indices of BOS related to

Services activities remained in the negative territory

during the year. Moreover, Google Community

Mobility reports have also witnessed a decline in

some of the key Services activities during 2020.

Wholesale and Retail Trade

In the backdrop of subdued demand

conditions and limited mobility, the value

added of wholesale and retail trade activities

grew only by 1.4 per cent in 2020, compared

to the growth of 3.0 per cent recorded in 2019.

Besides the developments in demand front, the

rationalisation of non-essential imports, together

with the restrictions on mobility imposed to contain

the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly during and

ahead of key festive seasons, largely attributed

to this slowdown in trade activities in 2020. The

total import volume index declined during the year

on top of the decline recorded in the previous

year, limiting the space for trade. Considering the

sub-categories of import volume index, the

consumer goods import volumes continued to

decline further during the year, largely driven by

the decrease in non-food consumer goods imports.

Meanwhile, import volumes of the intermediate

goods and investment goods also declined in 2020.

Transportation and Storage

Transportation of goods and passengers,

including warehousing activities, contracted

by 6.7 per cent in 2020 in value added terms,

in comparison to the growth of 1.4 per cent

recorded in 2019, mainly due to the COVID-19

pandemic related restrictions on mobility and

the set back in the tourism industry. Indicators

related to transportation activities witnessed this

hindrance in transportation services. Considering

the land transportation, total kilometres operated by

the bus operators as well as the Sri Lanka Railway

declined sharply in 2020, compared to 2019. The

subdued passenger traffic was also reflected in

Google Community Mobility trends for Sri Lanka

with respect to public transport. Meanwhile, air

transportation activities also contracted significantly

during the year, mainly due to the restricted

operations of Sri Lankan airports since mid-March

2020, as a measure of containing the pandemic.

Accordingly, the passenger kilometres flown by

SriLankan Airlines contracted significantly during the

year. Considering the water transport activity related

indicators, the container traffic (measured in terms

of TEUs - Twenty Foot Equivalent Units) and cargo

handled by Sri Lankan ports also declined during the

year compared to 2019.

Accommodation and Food Service Activities

With the significant contraction in tourist

arrivals, accommodation, food and beverage

service activities contracted significantly by

39.4 per cent in 2020 in value added terms, on

top of the decline of 4.6 per cent recorded in

2019. Tourist arrivals, which were affected by the

Easter Sunday attacks in 2019, declined further

by 73.5 per cent in 2020 amidst the restrictions

imposed on tourist arrivals to contain the spread

of the pandemic. Accordingly, the earnings from

tourism as well as the average room occupancy rate

in graded hotel establishments approved by the Sri

Lanka Tourism Development Authority decreased

significantly in 2020 compared to the previous

year. Further, owing to the restrictions on mobility

and gatherings, the local community stayed away

from dining at restaurants which adversely affected

the performance of food and beverage services.

Financial, Insurance and Real Estate Activities including Ownership of Dwellings

Financial, insurance, and real estate

activities, including ownership of dwellings

expanded by 5.0 per cent in 2020, in comparison

to the growth of 2.4 per cent recorded in 2019,

mainly supported by the substantial growth in

financial services, which benefitted from the

accommodative monetary policy stance that

prevailed during the year. Accordingly, financial

service activities and auxiliary financial services

grew by 10.9 per cent in 2020, compared to

the growth of 2.0 per cent recorded in 2019.

Considering the financial services related

indicators, the aggregate of gross loans and

advances in banks and non-bank financial

institutions grew in 2020, compared to the previous

year. This was also reflected by the expansion in

the sub-index of demand for bank credit in BOS.

Moreover, as per the Survey on Credit Supply

conducted by the Central Bank on a quarter-on-

quarter basis, the overall willingness to lend by the

banking sector increased during 2020. Further, the

aggregate deposit base of banks and non-bank

financial institutions also grew in 2020 despite the

prevailing low interest rate environment. In the

meantime, insurance, reinsurance, and pension

funding related activities grew marginally by

0.6 per cent in 2020, while real estate activities,

including ownership of dwellings, recorded a

contraction of 1.2 per cent during the year.

Information and Communication

Telecommunication, and IT programming

consultancy and related services grew by

14.1 per cent in 2020 compared to the growth of

16.2 per cent recorded in 2019, benefitting from

the increased demand for telecommunication

and IT services during the year under social

distancing-related measures. Accordingly,

telecommunication activities sustained a high

growth of 15.4 per cent in 2020 on top of the

growth of 17.2 per cent recorded in 2019, as

telecommunications infrastructure played a pivotal

role, particularly under the working-from-home

and learning-from-home arrangements adopted

by most workplaces and educational institutions

amidst the COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions

on mobility and physical distancing requirements.

Meanwhile, reflecting the growing demand for IT-

enabled services including e-commerce and digital

platforms that connect and ensure continuous

functioning of businesses, governments, and

societies, IT programming consultancy and

related activities also grew at a healthy rate of

10.0 per cent in 2020 on top of the growth of 13.1

per cent recorded in 2019.

Other Services Activities

Considering other services-related activities,

other personal services and professional services

contracted largely owing to the adverse impact

of the pandemic, while public administration,

education, and human health-related services

expanded during 2020 compared to 2019. Public

health-related concerns, restrictions on mobility

and social distancing requirement discouraged the

demand for personal services, such as entertainment

activities and beauty culture activities while the

setback in tourism-related activities also led the

demand for personal services related to hotels and

restaurants to decline during the year. Accordingly,

other personal services activities, which recorded

a growth of 2.1 per cent in 2019, contracted by

6.5 per cent in 2020. In the meantime, professional

services also declined by 2.7 per cent during the

year. However, public administration, defence, and

compulsory social security services and human

health-related services grew by 1.6 per cent and

4.3 per cent, respectively, in 2020, supported by

the government’s involvement in combatting the

COVID-19 pandemic throughout the year. Further,

education services grew by 0.9 per cent in 2020.

2.5 Expenditure

Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE), which

consists of consumption and investment

expenditure, recorded broadly a stagnant

performance at current prices in 2020 compared to

3.8 per cent growth in 2019. Accordingly, investment

expenditure contracted by 6.2 per cent in 2020, while

consumption expenditure grew at a moderate pace of

2.1 per cent in nominal terms in 2020 compared to

2019. On the external front, export of goods and

services declined significantly by 28.5 per cent

compared to 2019, reflecting the lack of demand from

export destinations which were severely affected

from COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the import of

goods and services also contracted by 21.8 per cent

compared to 2019, contributing favourably to the net

external demand, partly due to the measures taken

to rationalise non-essential imports and encourage

import substitution industries. Consequently, net

external demand at current prices contracted by 3.5

per cent in 2020 compared to the growth of 13.4

per cent in 2019. As a combined outcome of these

developments, GDP at current prices, which is the

aggregate of GDE and the net external demand,

contracted marginally by 0.3 per cent in 2020

compared to the growth of 5.1 per cent in 2019. At

constant prices, GDE contracted by 4.6 per cent in

2020, a higher rate compared to the marginal decline

of 0.7 per cent in 2019, owing to the decline in both

consumption and investment expenditure. In the

meantime, even amid the notable decline in exports,

net external demand at constant prices grew by

14.9 per cent in 2020 due to the positive contribution

from curtailing imports. As a result of these

developments, GDP at constant prices declined

by 3.6 per cent in 2020 compared to the growth of

2.3 per cent in 2019.

Consumption

Consumption expenditure, which accounted

for 81.1 per cent of the aggregate expenditure

of the economy at current prices in 2020, grew

at a moderate pace of 2.1 per cent during the

year compared to the growth of 7.4 per cent

in 2019, hampered by the lockdowns and the

cautious consumer spending due to income

uncertainty. This moderation is mainly attributable

to the considerable slowdown in private consumption

expenditure (PCE), which is the main consumption

expenditure category, while prices of most of the

consumer goods categories remained high during

the year. In the meantime, government consumption

expenditure (GCE) grew at a higher rate of

9.8 per cent in 2020 compared to the previous year.

Reflecting the negative impact on consumer

behaviour from the COVID-19 pandemic, PCE

at current prices grew only marginally by

1.0 per cent in 2020 compared to the growth

of 7.3 per cent in 2019. The pandemic formed

adverse conditions in many consumer markets

during the year led by restrictions on mobility,

working-from-home arrangements and other health-

related precautions which made consumers stay

away from the markets, contracting most PCE

categories such as transport, restaurants and

hotels, and clothing and footwear. However, being

essential goods and services, PCE on food and

non-alcoholic beverages, housing, water, electricity,

gas and other fuels, health and communication

categories expanded during the year even amidst a

pandemic.

The involvement of foreign investors has been notable in Sri Lanka’s mega scale development projects related to infrastructure and private sector ventures, particularly in the last decade. However, given the persistent gap between savings and required investment, difficulties in attracting enough foreign investments remain a major bottleneck that has slowed down Sri Lanka’s journey towards development. Such difficulties have had a multifaceted impact on growth, employment and income distribution. In the current context, the unforeseeable future bundled with the global pandemic has escalated the spectrum of challenges for Sri Lanka to address, including the need to reduce overdependency on debt creating foreign inflows, in order to sustain medium to long run economic growth and stability. Against this backdrop, the country has redoubled its efforts to attract foreign direct investments (FDIs) as a key source of non-debt creating inflows. In doing so, it is crucial to improve the investment landscape, which could be done by focussing on improving Sri Lanka’s global rankings (Table B 2.1), thereby enhancing the country’s viability as a preferred destination for investors based on different aspects of socio-economic conditions.

Sri Lanka was positioned at the 99th place out of 190 countries in the Ease of Doing Business Index1 of the World Bank in 2020, advancing by one position from the ranking in 2019. An overall score of 61.8 was recorded covering 10 areas of focus. In terms of the Global Competitiveness Index2 compiled by the World Economic Forum, Sri Lanka was positioned at the 84th place in 2019 out of 141 countries, and this was also an advancement of one place from the previous year. Both these reports highlight the areas of the economy, which hinder investor confidence and competitiveness. Based on the results, the followings could be highlighted as the key areas which require attention and timely redressal, not only to attract potential foreign investors, but also to facilitate domestic investments (Figure B 2.1).

Macroeconomic Stability

Maintaining macroeconomic stability, including low and stable inflation, is an important prerequisite for attracting investors. In a volatile environment, investors are unable to predict their future performance and profitability. During the past several years, with the support of prudent monetary

BOX 2Improved Global Rankings: Steppingstone for Investors

policy, inflation has been maintained in mid-single digits levels, although maintaining macroeconomic stability in terms of the performance of the external and fiscal sectors has been challenging. The country was positioned at the 118th place in 2019 in terms of macroeconomic stability in the Global Competitiveness Index, mainly due to low scores on debt dynamics. Strong commitment towards strict fiscal discipline, as envisaged in the national policy agenda, is key to improving the country’s standing on the global rankings.

Labour Market

Rigidities in the labour market is another concern of foreign investors due to mismatch of skillset, increasing cost of labour, unionisation and high compensation stemming from labour laws. Sri Lanka was ranked at the 118th position in terms of the labour market in the Global Competitiveness Index. This was driven by low scores on the ease of hiring foreign labour, internal labour mobility and redundancy costs. Investors face difficulties in terminating existing contracts under the prevailing labour laws. Further, labour mobility within the country is limited, thereby creating a lacuna in labour supply. While the protection of the workforce is essential, it must be understood that creating employment through attracting foreign investments and enhancing domestic investments is equally important. Ongoing government programmes for early identification of talent and promoting multiple vocational training programmes are expected to bear fruit in future, particularly as the country prepares for a high economic growth path. Labour market reforms will also support accruing benefits to the country with the establishment of the Colombo Port City and related development projects.

Government Policies

Economic and foreign policies of the Government have a direct bearing on foreign investor perception about the country. A stable and strong government with consistent policies will always be beneficial to establish a solid foundation for investor relations. Further, frequent reversals of the stance on existing or ongoing foreign investments

will tarnish the image of the country as an investment destination. In addition, one of the most common criticism of many governments around the world is corruption. Sri Lanka was ranked at the 94th position in the Corruption Perception Index3 in 2020 among 180 countries, whereas Denmark and New Zealand jointly have been ranked the least corrupted nations. Therefore, in establishing an investor friendly environment, strengthening the ongoing efforts to curtail corruption too is a decisive factor.

Tax Structure

A simple and effective tax system will increase the country’s attractiveness for doing business. Frequent changes in the tax structure of Sri Lanka have been a critical issue faced by investors in terms of long term planning. As per the Ease of Doing Business Index in 2020, the number of tax payments by a corporate per year in Sri Lanka was 36 and the average time spent on paying taxes has been 129 hours per annum placing the country at 142nd position under paying taxes. Tax system of Sri Lanka was recently updated with a more simplified structure and the Government is keen on maintaining the current tax policy for the medium term to support the businesses. Modernisation of return submission and other services with the use of technology will help simplifying the tax systems and in turn will motivate the taxpayers to honour the tax obligations without evading. Further, the ongoing efforts to increase the use of technology in paying taxes, which was enabled through the Revenue Administration Management Information System (RAMIS), will also be beneficial. While a considerable amount of work is left to be completed, authorities are on track to bring in necessary reforms to simplify the system and improve doing business indices.

Trade Openness

Complexity of the tariff structure, prevalence of non-tariff barriers and lack of border clearance efficiency have led to very low trade openness rank of 140th position out of 141 countries in the Global Competitiveness Index. Sri Lanka’s lacklustre performance in relation to regional trade blocs has been disadvantageous in connecting to global supply chain networks. In line with Government policy, all the foreign trade agreements are being revisited and necessary adjustments are expected in order to improve the bilateral trade balances with Sri Lanka’s key trading partners.

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Adoption

Sri Lanka has continued to embrace the latest technologies related to communication. However, industrial ICT adoption is not at a commendable level. The state sector usage of ICT systems is not in par with the private sector, although there have been notable improvements during the pandemic. In the Global Competitiveness Index, the country was ranked at 107th position for ICT adoption, with comparatively low usage of broadband, fibre and internet technologies. Sri Lanka has produced world class IT professionals and firms that engage in global projects. Therefore, improving the ICT systems in-house would be feasible as well as rewarding for the local talent while also reducing brain drain. Designated IT industrial zones (IT

Parks) and other targeted projects through Public-Private Partnerships have recently contributed to improve the overall level of IT adoption, and strengthening these efforts will be beneficial for investment.

Legal Processes

In terms of enforcing legal contracts, Sri Lanka was ranked at the 164th position in the Ease of Doing Business Index with an average time of 1,318 days for resolving a legal matter. Steps have been taken in the recent past to use technology for expediting the judicial processes. Preliminary work is underway to introduce e-courts and expedite the longstanding cases within a strict time frame. However, there is still a considerable progress required to improve legal processes. Releasing lands for various projects is also a tedious task for investors, due to rigidities in the land registration process and outdated laws related to land ownership. Therefore, the legal system needs to be restructured to facilitate investment. Establishment of an arbitration centre and additional Commercial Courts to resolve urgent business and investor cases would also be beneficial in improving the overall efficiency of the legal system.

Infrastructure Network

Infrastructure is one crucial element that holds together all other elements facilitating investment. A good road network and other modern commuter transport solutions, state-of-the-art seaports and airports and the provision of utilities without delays and interruptions are crucial to attract investment. During the past decade, Sri Lanka has accelerated improving the infrastructure network, hence positioning itself at the 61st place in the Global Competitiveness Index in terms of infrastructure. However, still there are concerns regarding road connectivity, efficiency of transport services and access to utilities. Addressing these concerns will contribute to attracting potential investors.

Way Forward

With unparalleled locational advantage, Sri Lanka’s potential as an investment destination has been well recognised, as evidenced by the positive responses received from the global investor community, at various investor fora, roadshows and many other promotional activities carried out by Sri Lankan authorities to attract FDIs to the country. However, such positive responses have not resulted in sufficient investment inflows due to the weaknesses discussed above. The Government has already initiated a programme to improve the country’s ease of doing business conditions, which will complement enhancing Sri Lanka’s position in global rankings. Provision of ‘One-Stop Shop’ facilities for investors would support the Government’s endeavours to entice investors. Meanwhile, the establishment of the Colombo Port City Commission is expected to provide a doing business environment that is in par with investment hotspots around the world, thereby raising the prospects to enhance the FDI inflows to new heights. While overcoming the complex challenges associated with the COVID-19 Pandemic, efforts must continue to address the identified weaknesses with a focussed approach, to establish the necessary steppingstones required for sustainable relationships with strategic investment partners.

GCE at current prices grew by 9.8 per cent in

2020, at a higher rate compared to the growth

of 8.1 per cent in 2019. A significant expansion

of 17.8 per cent in 2020 on top of the higher

growth of 28.0 per cent in 2019, was observed

in the individual consumption expenditure of

the Government, which includes the service

categories such as health and education,

contributing to the overall growth in GCE. Further,

the collective consumption expenditure, the

main GCE category that comprises the general

Government's expenditure on services such as

defence, public services and social protection,

which benefit households collectively, grew by

5.8 per cent in 2020, compared to the marginal

growth of 0.2 per cent in 2019. The Government’s

involvement in curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic

contributed to the expansion in GCE, especially

in the areas of health, public order and safety,

and defence.

Investment

Investment expenditure at current prices

further contracted by 6.2 per cent in 2020

compared to the contraction of 5.5 per cent

in 2019, mainly affected by the uncertainty

on the recovery timeline of the pandemic,

locally as well as globally. This decline

was driven by the noticeable contraction in

gross fixed capital formation by 6.4 per cent in

2020 compared to the growth of 8.1 per cent

in the previous year. Accordingly, the major

categories of gross fixed capital formation,

such as construction, transport equipment,

and machinery and equipment, contracted

in 2020 against the positive contributions

recorded in 2019. Construction activities, the

largest contributor to investment, experienced a

setback due to pandemic-related disturbances

severely affecting investment growth. However,

investment expenditure on categories such

as information and communication technology

equipment and intellectual property products

recorded a growth compared to the previous

year. Moreover, changes in inventories depleted

during the year.

Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) to BOI

companies, including loans, decreased by

42.2 per cent to US dollars 687.0 million5 in

2020, compared to US dollars 1,188.7 million

recorded in 2019. The contraction in FDIs was

witnessed across all the sectors. In the meantime,

the total value of projects approved by the BOI in

2020, under Sections 16 and 17 of the Board of

Investment (BOI) Act No. 4 of 1978, is estimated

at Rs. 406.3 billion depicting a contraction of

91.4 per cent compared to 2019. The estimated

investment value of projects that commenced

commercial operations, under Sections 16 and

17 of the BOI Act, amounted to Rs. 1,547.0 billion

and Rs. 34.5 billion, respectively, reflecting an

overall decline of 13.0 per cent compared to the

previous period.

5 This includes receipts, including loans, to companies registered with the BOI and differs from the estimates presented in Chapter 5, mainly due to the inclusion of FDIs to non-BOI companies in the latter. Accordingly, total FDIs amounted to US dollars 670 millions in 2020.

was recorded in the share of resources utilised for

investment purposes which was 20.5 per cent in 2020.

Further, the share of resources utilised for export

purposes also declined. Meanwhile, the resource

utilisation at constant prices contracted mainly due to

the decline in consumption and investments during

the year.

Savings

Both domestic and national savings of the

economy at current prices further contracted

in 2020. Domestic savings contracted by

9.1 per cent in 2020 contributed by a considerable

surge in government dis-savings mainly due to

the lower government revenue on account of the

reduction in taxes and decline in economic activities

due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and a slower

growth in private savings. Consequently, domestic

savings as a percentage of GDP decreased to

18.9 per cent in 2020 compared to 20.7 per cent in

2019. Meanwhile, even though net primary income

as well as the net current transfers from rest of the

world grew during the year in rupee terms, national

savings contracted by 3.6 per cent in 2020, largely

owing to the contraction in domestic savings.

Consequently, national savings as a percentage of

GDP decreased to 23.9 per cent in 2020. Further,

despite the contraction in national savings, the

national savings-investment gap narrowed to

1.4 per cent of GDP in 2020, from 2.1 per cent of GDP

in 2019, due to the considerable decline in investment

expenditure.

2.6 Income

Gross Operating Surplus (GOS) continued to

be the largest income component of the economy

during the year, followed by Compensation of

Employees (CE) and taxes less subsidies on

production. GOS grew marginally by 0.7 per cent at

current prices in 2020, accounting for 63.4 per cent

of GDP. This slower growth was mainly attributable

to the slowdown in Net Operating Surplus (NOS)

during the year. With respect to the other major

sources of income, CE recorded a growth, while

taxes less subsidies on production contracted during

the year. When considering the institutional sector

classification, the highest contribution to the income

was generated by the HH and NPISH sector followed

by NFC, GG and FC.

2.7 Population, Labour Force and Employment

Population

The mid-year population in Sri Lanka was

estimated at 21.919 million in 2020 as per the

mid-year population estimates compiled by the

Registrar General’s Department. Accordingly,

the population growth rate moderated further to

0.5 per cent in 2020 from 0.6 per cent recorded in

2019. The highest contributions for the population

growth were from Eastern and Western Provinces,

respectively. The lowest contributions for the

population growth were from Northern and North

Central Provinces, respectively. Continuing the

same trend observed, Western Province continued

to account for the highest share of mid-year

population of 28.1 per cent, followed by Central

and Southern Provinces accounting for shares of

12.7 per cent and 12.2 per cent of the mid-year

population, respectively, in 2020. Meanwhile,

Northern Province continued to account for

the lowest share of mid-year population of

5.3 per cent.

Labour Force

The labour force, which is the economically

active population,6 declined to 8.467 million

in 2020 from 8.592 million recorded in

2019. Accordingly, the economically inactive

population increased to 8.273 million in 2020 from

7.832 million in 2019. The persons who lost

employment suspending their availability to work and

active job search steered this significant increase

6 This is the current economically active population, i.e. the number of persons (aged 15 years and above), who are employed or unemployed during the reference one-week period.

in inactivity. The lack of interest towards working

was possibly due to the containment measures that

restricted movement, discouragements with regard to

lack of job openings and health risks, which prevailed

amidst the spread of COVID-19 pandemic.

In line with the decline in labour force and

increase in inactive population, the labour force

participation rate (LFPR), which is the ratio of

the labour force to the household population,

decreased to 50.6 per cent in 2020 from

52.3 per cent in 2019. Accordingly, the male and

female LFPRs decreased to 71.9 per cent and

32.1 per cent, respectively, in 2020 from 73.0 per cent

and 34.5 per cent, respectively, in 2019. Meanwhile,

the pandemic period intensified the deep-rooted

gender inequalities in the labour force, soaring the

gender gap in LFPR further to 39.8 per cent in 2020

from 38.5 per cent in 2019.

Employment

The employed population7 decreased to

7.999 million in 2020 from 8.181 million in 2019.

The decline in employment was caused by the

declines observed, particularly in temporary and

casual categories of employment, in Industry and

Services. In contrast, employment in Agriculture

recorded a growth, possibly due to the exemptions

that existed in relation to Agriculture activities

during the lockdown periods with a view to ensuring

food security amidst import restrictions and

pandemic related disruptions to global food supply

chains. Accordingly, the share of employment in

Agriculture increased to 27.1 per cent in 2020 from

25.3 per cent in 2019. Meanwhile, the shares of

employment in Industry and Services, which was

the foremost employment generator, declined to

26.9 per cent and 46.0 per cent, respectively, in 2020

from 27.6 per cent and 47.1 per cent, respectively,

in 2019. Nevertheless, some new jobs, such as PPE

makers and delivery workers, were also created with

new demands that emerged during the pandemic.

Meanwhile, the private sector continued to remain the

main employment generator in Sri Lanka representing

the largest share of 42.7 per cent followed by own

account workers, which accounted for 33.2 per cent

of the total employment during 2020.

As per the Public Sector Employment Survey

conducted by the Central Bank, total public

sector employment increased to 1.528 million

at the end of 2020 compared to 1.467 million

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic had an unprecedented impact on the labour market. Especially the pandemic affected the deep-rooted work routines and cultures due to the precautionary and containment measures taken to combat the spread of the pandemic, which restricted the performance of work in the usual working environment. Accordingly, work from home (WFH), flexible hours and roster systems were adopted on a broad basis. Even though WFH had already been adopted in some areas of industries and occupations, it was largely popularised during the pandemic as a temporary measure of business continuity. The pandemic has presented with an unprecedented opportunity to rethink the importance of presence, proximity and workspace planning to many entities. At the same time the WFH has challenges as well, where the success of broad based adoption of this strategy depends on many factors, including shared responsibility, commitment and mutual understanding between the employer and employee.

Advantages, Disadvantages and Challenges of Working from Home

WFH provides many benefits to employees as well as to employers. From the employee’s point of view, reduced commuting time and related expenses, greater flexibility in terms of location and working time, less distractions and better work life balance are the key benefits. Reduced operational expenses related to utility costs and workspace, and staff expenses related to overtime and transport allowances, improved productivity, engagement and employee satisfaction, and reduced turnover are the key benefits of such arrangements, from the employer’s point of view. In addition, WFH has been continuously highlighted as a measure to improve female labour force participation in Sri Lanka, which has been stagnating at a low level for a prolonged period. WFH is a mechanism to augment resource availability in the country, thereby promoting the economic growth in the long run. Positive impact on the environment through reduced carbon emissions and reduced traffic congestion and oil imports as a result of less vehicular movements, and reduced urbanisation are additional benefits of such arrangements at the national level.

Nevertheless, WFH arrangements come with some limitations and challenges in its practical implementation. At the outset, all industries, occupation types and job functions are not feasible under WFH arrangements. Even though email communication was formalised during the period, as all the paperwork and procedures are still not digitised, especially in the public sector, there would be omissions and inefficiencies

BOX 3COVID-19 Instigated Paradigm Shift in Work Routines towards Work from Home

in carrying out relevant tasks off work premises. For instance, the WFH implemented in the public sector of Sri Lanka, in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, was not fully successful due to the issues existed with related to Information and Communications Technology (ICT) infrastructure, ICT literacy as well as manual processes and procedures. In addition, most of the public sector job functions are less suitable to perform in WFH arrangements as the public services provided to the general public should be performed in person given the current status of digitalisation. Hence, there should be a clear identification and assessment of the industries, companies, occupation types and job functions that are feasible in WFH arrangements with proper legislations with regard to terms and conditions related to such arrangements. Further, ICT literacy level, required supervision level and the capacity to perform work outside the work premises in terms of the adequate availability and quality of physical and ICT infrastructure and equipment, living arrangements, and other responsibilities of the employees should be assessed on a case-by-case basis (International Labour Organization (ILO), 2020). In particular, low levels of computer and digital literacy in Sri Lanka, which stands at 30.8 per cent and 46.0 per cent, respectively (Department of Census and Statistics, 2020), and the increase in threats related to data security breaches are also key concerns. Hence, when continuing WFH arrangements in the long run, expanding the network coverage, and improving the computer and digital literacy would be essential. In addition, improving required network infrastructure and cyber security to support remote working arrangements and transitioning towards an online working environment through digitising paperwork and approval procedures are also important.

Specific and targeted training with regard to the use of technology in performing duties, communicating and interacting is important for smooth functioning of such arrangements. Most importantly, changes in the terms and conditions of employment contract or clear guidelines of company policies with regard to the place of rendering service and WFH schedule (total or partial) and term (indefinite or fixed term) should be established at the initial stage (Carey, 2020). Further, the responsible party for the setup and related expenses of physical and ICT infrastructure, designated communication channels, and provision on working hours and resting periods that are in line with national legislation should also be established through terms and conditions of employment contract or guidelines of company policies to minimise conflict of interest and achieve an optimal level of productivity (ILO, 2020).

in 2019. This includes employees in ministries,

departments, district secretariats, divisional

secretariats, provincial councils and semi-

government institutions. The increase observed

in public sector employment was due to the

Government programme to provide jobs for

60,000 unemployed graduates and 100,000

persons in the lowest strata of income earners.

Exposing the deep-rooted vulnerabilities,

informal employment was severely affected

by the COVID-19 pandemic. Amidst the

containment measures taken to curb the spread

of the COVID-19 pandemic, the informal sector

was severely affected due to the disruptions to

their capacity to earn a living. As the informal

sector employment is not covered by any

Lack of focus, motivation and productivity due to distractions in home working environment, conflicts in work and household responsibilities, poor infrastructure and network facilities, and absence of face-to-face monitoring are the disadvantages of WFH arrangements. Accordingly, with a drastic change in the employer-employee relationship, new methods of engaging, managing, controlling and measuring performance of employees should also be established in order to maintain the motivation levels and performance of the employees. This includes, moving away from traditional command and control style of management towards results-based management (ILO, 2020) and frequent communication and checks. In addition, new methods of communicating and interacting should be in place to maintain company culture and team cohesiveness, and to minimise the mental strain of employees. Meanwhile, maintaining clear demarcations of working hours should be a priority in the permanent adoption of WFH arrangement in order to prevent overworking related long term effects on the physical and mental health of the employees, work-family conflicts and maintain an optimal level of productivity in the long run.

Employees should also have clear demarcations between work and household responsibilities through proper arrangements for dependent care and household responsibilities to minimise disturbances from living arrangement in delivering an optimal level of productivity. In addition, maintaining mental and physical health by regular communication and interaction with the team, and using proper physical infrastructure are important in achieving an optimal level of productivity in WFH arrangements in the long run.

Way Forward

Given the opportunity to check the feasibility of WFH arrangements on a large scale during pandemic period, benefits of this paradigm shift can be reaped even in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic to achieve higher economic growth of the country in medium to long term via increased labour force participation and savings. However, addressing the practical difficulties, challenges and downsides is vital for its smooth functioning and in reaping the desired benefits from such arrangements. In addition, the large public sector should also undergo a drastic change technologically in being work from home ready in terms of ICT infrastructure, digital systems and ICT literacy. Embracing a permanent adoption of the COVID-19 pandemic driven digital transformation of work, which was previously less convincing for employers would be a way of propelling the economy to a higher growth path and enhancing living standards of the people, while simultaneously improving the work-life balance and satisfaction of the workforce in the country.

Foreign Employment

Departures for foreign employment

declined sharply by 73.6 per cent to 53,713

in 2020, from 203,087 in 2019 with the spread

of COVID-19 pandemic. This sharp decline was

attributable to the temporary ban imposed by Sri

Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE)

on departures of migrant workers registered

with them, travel restrictions at labour receiving

countries, suspension of recruitment of foreign

workers, and reduced demand for migrant labour.

Both male and female departures for foreign

employment declined by 73.5 per cent and

73.7 per cent, respectively, in 2020 compared to

2019. In line with the decline in total departures

for foreign employment, departures for foreign

employment under all skill categories, namely,

professional, middle level, clerical and related,

skilled, semi-skilled, unskilled and housemaid,

declined drastically in 2020 compared to the

previous year. Meanwhile, the Middle East region

continued to remain the main foreign employment

destination in 2020 as well, accounting for 82.0

per cent of the total departures for foreign

employment. However, the departures for foreign

employment to the Middle East region declined

by 74.5 per cent, compared to 2019.

the unemployment rate during the pandemic

period reduced as the decline in the employed

population not being completely translated into

the increase in the unemployed population.

This was because the job losers temporarily or

permanently halted searching and accepting new

jobs due to the situation prevailed. However,

underemployment increased significantly during

2020 due to the underutilisation of the productive

capacity of the labour force as reflected by the

significant decrease in the labour hours.

Aggravating the inequalities further,

the unemployment rates amongst females,

youth and educationally qualified persons

increased considerably in 2020. Accordingly,

the unemployment rate of females increased

significantly to 8.4 per cent in 2020 from

7.4 per cent in 2019. Meanwhile, the

unemployment rate of males also increased to

4.0 per cent in 2020 from 3.3 per cent in 2019.

The persistent issues with the employability skills

of females and gender related mismatches have

kept the unemployment rate of females more

than two times higher than their counterparts.

Sri Lankan migrant workers were severely

affected by the spread of the COVID-19

pandemic in the labour receiving countries.

With the spread of the first wave of the COVID-19

pandemic in the European region, a large number

of Sri Lankan migrant workers returned to the

country in panic in the beginning of 2020 from Italy,

South Korea and other European countries. Since

the closure of the airports to incoming commercial

flights in order to prevent the transmission of

COVID-19 into Sri Lanka, a considerable number

of migrant workers looked forward to being

repatriated. The need for repatriation amplified

amidst the panic with regard to health risks, and

contract expirations, job losses and pay cuts

resulted from the economic downturn caused by

the pandemic. As the domestic labour market

is already in a turmoil with the negative impact

of COVID-19, appropriate measures have to

be introduced to facilitate the reemployment of

migrant workers who were repatriated due to

job losses as well as persons who missed the

anticipated foreign employment opportunities due

to the halt in departures in foreign destinations by

continuously exploring opportunities. Meanwhile,

the establishment of appropriate social security

measures are imperative to face future distresses

in the international labour market.

Labour Relations and Labour Market Reforms

The number of man days lost due to

strikes decreased during 2020 possibly with

the restrictions prevailed to curb the spread

of COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, the total

number of man days lost due to strikes declined

significantly by 59.7 per cent in 2020 compared

to 2019 with the significant declines observed in

the number of man days lost due to strikes in both

plantation sector and other private institutions.

Further, the number of workers involved in strikes

also declined by 19.5 per cent in 2020 compared to

2019 mainly with the decline in number of workers

involved in strikes in other private institutions.

However, the number of strikes increased during

2020 compared to 2019 due to the increase in the

number of strikes in the plantation sector.

several acts. Accordingly, amendments are to be

introduced to the Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of

1950: to empower the Labour Tribunal enforcing

orders; to authorise a representative to appear

for a worker who makes an application regarding

the termination of employment; and to enable

a lawyer to appear before the Commissioner

General of Labour in inquiries on behalf of parties.

Further, amendments are to be introduced to the

National Minimum Wage of Workers Act No. 03 of

Several measures were taken by the

Ministry of Labour9 during 2020 to improve

industrial harmony. Accordingly, a task force

consisting of trade unions and employers was

established by the Ministry of Labour to handle

labour issues during the pandemic period.

Thereby, consensus was arrived at regarding the

retention of employees in institutions, where work

was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic,

and implementing a roster system or any other

suitable mechanism to ensure that all employees

were given monthly work proportionately in

situations, where all employees could not be called

for work. Further, consensus was arrived at paying

50 per cent of the last paid basic salary or

Rs. 14,500 per month, whichever was more

favourable to the employee, in situations, where

employees were required to stay at home due to

lack of work in the months of May and June 2020.

Consequently, this agreement was extended up

to 30 September 2020 and further extended up to

31 December 2020, where all sectors except the

tourism sector needed to obtain the approval from

the Commissioner General of Labour. Meanwhile,

9 The name of the Ministry of Skills Development, Employment and Labour Relations was changed as Ministry of Labour with effect from 09 August 2020.

2016 to increase the national minimum wage to

Rs. 12,500.00 per month from Rs. 10,000.00

per month, and Employees’ Provident Fund Act No.

15 of 1958 to make it mandatory to inform to the

Department of Labour within specific period of time

about new employee recruitments. Furthermore,

the Employment of Women, Young Persons and

Children Act No. 47 of 1956 is to be amended to

update the hazardous occupations list for young

persons below 18 years of age. In addition, the

Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special

Provisions) Act No. 45 of 1971 is due to be

amended to provide for increasing the maximum

limit of compensation of the compensation formula

from Rs. 1.25 million to Rs. 2.5 million, and the

Workmen's Compensation Ordinance No. 19 of

1934 to provide for increasing compensation for

workers up to Rs. 2.0 million from Rs. 0.5 million.

Labour Productivity

Labour productivity, measured in terms

of Gross Value Added (GVA) (in 2010 prices)

per hour worked increased by 12.5 per cent to

Rs. 577.17 per hour worked in 2020 from

Rs. 513.17 per hour worked in 2019.

This considerable increase in overall labour

productivity was underpinned by the increase

in labour productivity in Industry and Services

activities by 13.2 per cent and 22.4 per cent,

respectively. Accordingly, labour productivity

in Industry and Services activities increased to

Rs. 611.89 per hour worked and Rs. 764.29

per hour worked, respectively, in 2020 from

Rs. 540.70 per hour worked and Rs. 624.33

per hour worked, respectively, in 2019. This was

mainly due to the significant reduction in hours

worked amidst the restrictions that prevailed to

contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic,

regardless of the comparatively small drop in

GVA. In contrast, reversing the gradual increasing

trend, labour productivity in Agriculture activities

declined by 7.8 per cent to Rs. 177.54 per hour

worked in 2020 from Rs. 192.46 per hour worked

in 2019 owing to the increase in hours worked

amidst the employment shift towards Agriculture

activities and the decline in GVA. Accordingly,

in terms of the level of productivity, Services

activities continued to exhibit the most efficient use

of labour resource, recording the highest labour

productivity level, followed by Industry activities,

while Agriculture activities recorded the lowest.
