"2.1 Overview"
"The  Sri  Lankan  economy  contracted  by  3.6  per  cent  in  2020  on  year-on-year  basis  in  the  backdrop  of"
"indices compiled by the Central Bank recorded their lowest values in 2020, particularly during the second quarter,"
"reflecting  the  adverse  impact  of  the  nationwide  lockdown.  The  pandemic  situation  severely  affected  economic"
"activities for which physical engagement is vital, such as construction, manufacturing and transportation, in addition"
"to the whole ecosystem built around the tourism industry. The setback in construction and manufacturing activities"
"caused the contraction in Industry activities, while Services activities were adversely affected predominantly due"
"to  the  contraction  in  transportation,  other  personal  services,  and  accommodation,  food  and  beverage  services"
"activities. Meanwhile, Agriculture activities also recorded a decline largely due to the pandemic-related disturbances,"
"though the conducive policy environment supported the continuation of most Agriculture activities even during the"
"lockdown periods. Investment expenditure contracted in 2020, mainly due to the uncertainty on the recovery timeline"
"of the pandemic, locally as well as globally, whilst consumption expenditure recorded a slower growth. External"
"demand also weakened during the year on the grounds of a loss of growth momentum across geographies with"
"the pandemic. However, the rationalisation of non-essential imports curtailing the merchandise imports during the"
"year, partly contributed to buffer the deterioration in net external demand amidst the contraction in exports. In 2020,"
"the national savings-investment gap as a percentage of GDP narrowed on account of the considerable contraction"
"in investment expenditure though national savings recorded a decline of 3.6 per cent during the year, compared to"
"2019. In line with the adverse impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on economic activities, the labour market"
"exposed its long term fragilities and vulnerabilities, deepening structural issues and inequalities further. Accordingly,"
"resulting in a loss of family incomes, the unemployment rate increased to 5.5 per cent in 2020, the highest since 2009,"
"amidst a considerable decline in labour force mainly due to the drop in female labour force participation. Meanwhile,"
"the  unemployment  rate  amongst  females,  youth  and  educationally  qualified  persons  increased  considerably  in"
"2020 aggravating the inequalities further. In addition, departures for foreign employment declined sharply amidst"
"the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, while Sri Lankan migrant workers were also severely affected."
