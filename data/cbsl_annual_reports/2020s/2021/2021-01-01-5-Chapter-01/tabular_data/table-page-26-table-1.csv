and  Health  Survey 
(DHS)-2016  conducted  by 
to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the 
United Nations, food security is the condition that exists

preventive measures, such as lockdowns and mobility 
live  an  active  and  healthy  life.  This  definition  covers 
four  major  dimensions  of  food  security:  availability, 
access, utilisation, and stability. Therefore, the concept 
of food security is broader than basic food production 
and  ensuring  availability  of  an  adequate  food  supply. 
It  encompasses  numerous 
dimensions  of  food  security  such  as  food  production, 
distribution  and  storage,  spatial  availability  of  food, 
nutritional adequacy, economic and social accessibility, 
preferences,  non-food  aspects  such  as  clean  water, 
sanitation and other healthcare services, which improve 
food utilisation by individuals, as well as constancy of 
adequate food availability even during sudden shocks 
such  as  pandemics,  wars  or  any  seasonal,  cyclical 
or  other  unexpected  events.  Food  insecurity  results  in 
hunger  in  the  short-run,  but  persistent  food  insecurity 
causes  malnutrition 
issues,  such  as 
of  underweight,  stunting,  wasting  and  micronutrient 
deficiencies, 
and 
even 
Unhealthy  food  choices  compelled  by  food  insecurity, 
carbohydrate rich diets for example, can lead to obesity 
and  non-communicable  diseases 
hypertension. Generally, children are mostly affected by 
chronic  food  insecurity,  resulting  in  lower  educational 
outcomes that will limit their economic opportunities in 
adulthood. Hence, ensuring food security is crucial for 
reducing  hunger  and  poverty  in  Sri  Lanka  in  line  with 
the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs),  thereby 
improving the general wellbeing of the population and 
has  made  significant  progress  towards  ensuring  food 
security of the population in the past few decades, the 
onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened food 
insecurity at national and household levels.  
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Status 
of Food Security 
As per the FAO, 8.9 per cent of the world population, 
i.e., approximately 690 million people, were estimated 
to  be  undernourished  prior 
preliminary  estimation  by  the  FAO  indicates  that  the 
COVID-19  pandemic  may  add  between  83  million 
to  132  million  people
