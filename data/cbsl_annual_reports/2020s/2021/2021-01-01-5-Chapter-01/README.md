1.1 OverviewT

he complex challenges encountered by the Sri Lankan economy in 2020 were efficaciously

addressed through extraordinary policy interventions by the Government and the Central Bank.

These interventions were essential to mitigate the socioeconomic impact of the spillovers of the

COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant scarring of households and enterprises. Such interventions were

also required to uphold the confidence in the economy, thereby averting acute stresses on macroeconomic

and financial system stability.

Alongside the global economic downturn induced by the pandemic, the Sri Lankan economy contracted by

3.6 per cent in real terms in 2020, recording the deepest recession since independence. Mobility restrictions

and other containment measures imposed locally and internationally, with a view to preventing the spread

of COVID-19, hampered real economic activity across all sectors. The sharp contraction observed in

Industry activities during the year was driven by the significant slowdown in construction and manufacturing

activities. Services activities also registered a notable contraction due to the pandemic driven deceleration in

transportation, other personal services, and accommodation, food and beverage services. The Agriculture

sector, too, registered a contraction during the year as the impact of the pandemic outweighed the positive

effects of timely policy support and favourable weather conditions. Investment expenditure contracted in

2020, reflecting subdued investor sentiments, while consumption expenditure displayed a marginal growth.

The contraction of investment expenditure exceeded the reduction in national savings, resulting in a decline

in the savings-investment differential in 2020. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate rose above 5 per cent

for the first time since 2009, with a decline in the labour force participation rate, in the wake of uncertainties

surrounding the pandemic. Reflecting the combined effect of the contraction in Gross Domestic Product

(GDP) at current market prices and the depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee against the US dollar,

GDP per capita declined to US dollars 3,682 in 2020 from US dollars 3,852 in the previous year. The

pandemic also caused a decline in the overall size of the economy to US dollars 80.7 billion in 2020 from

US dollars 84.0 billion in 2019. In spite of the overall contraction, the economy began to show strong signs

of recovery during the second half of 2020, responding to the pro-growth policy initiatives across the fiscal

and monetary policy fronts.

Supported by timely policy measures undertaken by the Government and the Central Bank, the external

sector battled strong headwinds in 2020. The slump in merchandise exports due to the mobility restrictions

and lockdown measures was swiftly overcome, demonstrating the resilience of Sri Lankan exporters.

Accordingly, export earnings rebounded within a relatively short span of time to reach pre-pandemic

levels. Measures to curtail non-essential imports, together with the significantly low global petroleum prices,

helped reduce the import expenditure in 2020, resulting in a notable improvement in the trade deficit. The

tourism sector was severely affected by global travel restrictions. Foreign inflows, in terms of trade in services

relating to the Information Technology and Business Process Outsourcing (IT/BPO) sector, recorded a

significant improvement, supported by the surge in novel work arrangements amidst the pandemic. Workers’

remittances recorded a notable recovery during 2020, despite the decline witnessed at the onset of the

pandemic. With these developments and policy induced adjustments, the external current account deficit

improved to 1.3 per cent of GDP in 2020 from 2.2 per cent of GDP in 2019. Meanwhile, inflows to the

financial account moderated amidst heightened global uncertainties and the cautious approach adopted

by investors towards foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio investment. Despite pressures

experienced during March-April 2020, and in late 2020, significant volatilities in the exchange rate were

prevented with timely measures, and the depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee against the US dollar was

contained at 2.6 per cent in 2020. Overall, the Central Bank absorbed foreign exchange from the domestic

foreign exchange market on a net basis during 2020, and gross official reserves were recorded at US dollars

5.7 billion at end 2020, which provided an import cover of 4.2 months.

Fiscal policy was reoriented towards supporting an ailing economy at the turn of the year. However,

fiscal operations were faced with significant challenges during 2020 amidst the pandemic, which resulted in

lower-than-expected revenue mobilisation and high recurrent expenditure. Capital expenditure was

curtailed due to limited fiscal space as well as the impact of the pandemic on economic activity. Reflecting

the increased pressure on fiscal operations, the overall fiscal outcome was weaker than initially expected,

with a widened deficit in the current account balance and the primary balance, and the overall budget

balance being recorded at 11.1 per cent of GDP in 2020. Pressures on the fiscal sector were aggravated

by constrained access to foreign financing in 2020 amidst unfavourable global financial market conditions

and downgrades of Sri Lanka’s rating by sovereign rating agencies. Financing of the budget deficit was

met from domestic sources in 2020, reflecting the limited access to mobilising funds from foreign sources

and the Government’s explicit financing strategy, aimed at reducing the foreign exposure over the

medium term. Reflecting the expanded budget deficit and resultant large financing requirements as well

as the contraction of GDP, the outstanding central government debt rose to 101.0 per cent of GDP at end

2020, from 86.8 per cent of GDP at end 2019. Nevertheless, the relative share of outstanding foreign debt

to total central government debt declined notably to 40.0 per cent at end 2020, from 47.6 per cent at end

2019. Amidst adverse speculation, the Government continued to maintain its impeccable debt service

record. Despite the limited fiscal space, the Government continued to provide relief to the businesses and

individuals facing severe hardships stemming from the pandemic, with financial support from the Central

Bank and the banking sector.

Meanwhile, subdued inflationary pressures and well-anchored inflation expectations provided the

necessary space for the Central Bank to significantly relax its monetary policy stance during 2020.

These measures were focused on lowering costs of funds for businesses and individuals, ensuring

adequate liquidity in the money market, and facilitating the smooth functioning of the financial system

under the challenging circumstances caused by the pandemic. The Central Bank implemented extremely

accommodative monetary policy measures during 2020, through the reduction of the key policy interest

rates to historic lows with a downward adjustment of 250 basis points in total, and the lowering of the

Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) applicable on rupee deposit liabilities of licensed commercial banks

(LCBs) by a total of 300 basis points and the Bank Rate by 650 basis points. In addition, the Central

Bank introduced several concessionary loan schemes aimed at providing working capital for businesses

affected by the pandemic. Moreover, the Central Bank used direct measures as well as moral suasion

to accelerate the reduction in lending rates pertaining to selected financial products. Accordingly, credit

extended to the private sector began to rebound in the second half of 2020. Meanwhile, the Central Bank

and the banking sector provided necessary financing to the Government to carry out fiscal operations

in an undeterred manner amidst the pandemic. Consequently, net credit to the government from the

banking system increased substantially during 2020, alongside the expansion of credit to other sectors,

thereby resulting in a notable expansion of broad money supply. Meanwhile, the Central Bank ensured

the maintenance of financial system stability by introducing several measures aimed at safeguarding the

interests of financial institutions as well as those of depositors, while enabling the financial sector to provide

the extraordinary support required by the economy due to the pandemic.

While addressing near term vulnerabilities stemming from the pandemic remains an immediate priority,

resolving the persistent structural impediments that hinder the country’s long term growth prospects is

essential in the period ahead. The novel economic policy framework of the Government is expected to

address impediments to growth and promote domestic production, especially through the agriculture sector

and earmarked manufacturing and export industries, while enhancing non debt creating foreign exchange

inflows. The challenges brought about by the pandemic reinforced the need for a novel approach to achieve

sustained growth, development and long term stability of the economy. In support of this framework, the

Government is expected to continue its pro-growth fiscal policy stance and actively implement productivity

enhancing reforms, while remaining committed to ensuring fiscal consolidation over the medium term. In

the meantime, the Central Bank will remain committed to maintaining economic, price and financial system

stability, and thereby facilitating the pursuit of the economy to attain its high growth potential over the

medium term.

Developments in 20201

Real Sector Developments and Inflation

The Sri Lankan economy contracted in

2020, reflecting the effects of the COVID-19

pandemic. As per the provisional national accounts

estimates of the Department of Census and Statistics

(DCS), the Sri Lankan economy contracted by

3.6 per cent in 2020, compared to the 2.3 per cent

growth recorded in the preceding year. This overall

contraction in 2020 was driven by the year-on-year

contraction of 16.4 per cent experienced during the

second quarter of the year, due to the nationwide

lockdown measures imposed to contain the

COVID-19 outbreak. Nevertheless, the economy

rebounded during the second half of the

year, registering a real growth of 1.3 per cent,

year-on-year, in spite of the disruptions caused

during October-November with the second wave of

the pandemic. All sectors of the economy contracted

during 2020 (agriculture, forestry and fishing by 2.4

per cent, industry by 6.9 per cent, and services by

1.5 per cent), compared to the previous year. Of the

agricultural sector, the subsectors of marine fishing

and marine aquaculture, and forestry and logging

activities contracted notably due to the disruptions

caused by the pandemic, while growing of oleaginous

fruits also contracted owing to lagged effects of dry

weather conditions that prevailed in 2019. On the

other hand, the subsectors of growing of vegetables,

rice, fruits and cereals other than rice, recorded a

healthy performance during 2020, supported by the

Government’s policy initiatives to promote domestic

agricultural production. Within the industrial sector,

subdued performance in construction, manufacturing

of textiles, apparel, leather and leather related

products, and mining and quarrying subsectors

primarily contributed to the contraction of industrial

activities during 2020, although manufacturing of

food, beverages and tobacco products recorded

a growth during the year. Of the services sector,

financial services and auxiliary financial services,

telecommunication, and wholesale and retail trade

activities grew during 2020, thereby lessening the

impact of the contraction of subsectors of transportation

of goods and passengers, including warehousing,

other personal services, and accommodation, food

and beverage service activities, which were affected

by mobility restrictions, social distancing measures

and border closures during 2020. The taxes less

subsidies component of the GDP contracted by

8.0 per cent in 2020, reflecting the impact of low tax

revenue and increased production subsidies during

the year.

In nominal terms, the Sri Lankan economy

contracted by 0.3 per cent in 2020, compared to

the expansion of 5.1 per cent in the previous year.

This, along with the depreciation of the Sri Lankan

rupee, caused the overall size of the economy to

contract to US dollars 80.7 billion in 2020 from US

dollars 84.0 billion in the previous year, and per capita

GDP to decline to US dollars 3,682 in 2020 from

US dollars 3,852 in 2019. On the expenditure front,

final consumption expenditure recorded a moderate

growth of 2.1 per cent in 2020 at current prices,

in comparison to a growth of 7.4 per cent in 2019.

Particularly, the growth of household consumption

expenditure moderated to 1.0 per cent in 2020

from 7.3 per cent growth in the preceding year.

hand, grew by 9.8 per cent, in nominal terms during

2020, compared to the growth of 8.1 per cent in 2019.

Consequently, the share of consumption expenditure

in GDP at current prices increased from 79.3 per cent

in 2019 to 81.1 per cent in 2020. Meanwhile, gross

capital formation, which registered a contraction of

5.5 per cent in 2019, shrank further by 6.2 per

cent in 2020 at current prices. The share of gross

capital formation in nominal GDP declined from

26.8 per cent in 2019 to 25.2 per cent in 2020. Net

external demand for goods and services contracted

by 3.5 per cent at current prices in 2020, compared

to the growth of 13.4 per cent in 2019, reflecting the

combined effect of the slowdown in global demand,

border closures that severely affected tourism,

as well as the imposition of import restrictions,

aimed at easing pressures in the external sector.

Although private savings increased, dissavings

of the Government caused domestic savings

as a percentage of nominal GDP to decline to

18.9 per cent in 2020 from 20.7 per cent in 2019. The

domestic savings-investment gap as a percentage of

GDP widened from -6.1 per cent in 2019 to -6.4 per

cent in 2020, reflecting the decline in domestic savings

exceeding the decline in gross capital formation in

2020. However, improvements in net primary income

and net current transfers from the rest of the world

limited the decline in national savings to 23.9 per

cent of GDP in 2020 from 24.7 per cent in 2019.

Deeper contraction in domestic investment caused

the national savings-investment gap to improve from

-2.1 per cent of the GDP in 2019 to -1.4 per cent of

GDP in 2020.

Effects of the pandemic were observed in

the unemployment rate as well as the labour

force participation rate (LFPR). Accordingly, the

unemployment rate increased to 5.5 per cent in 2020

from 4.8 per cent in the previous year. Unemployment

rates amongst males and females increased from

3.3 per cent and 7.4 per cent in 2019, respectively, to

4.0 per cent and 8.4 per cent, respectively, in 2020.

Meanwhile, with the mobility restrictions imposed to

curtail the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, LFPR

declined to 50.6 per cent in 2020 from 52.3 per

cent recorded in the preceding year. LFPR of both

males and females declined from 73.0 per cent and

34.5 per cent, respectively, in 2019 to 71.9 per cent

and 32.1 per cent, respectively, in 2020. Agriculture,

industry and services sectors accounted for

27.1 per cent, 26.9 per cent and 46.0 per cent of the

total employment, respectively.

Headline inflation remained broadly within

the desired range of 4-6 per cent during 2020,

while core inflation remained low throughout

the year. Subdued demand conditions, well-

anchored inflation expectations,2 and downward

revisions to administered prices helped maintain

inflation at the targeted level, despite upward

pressures from food inflation, particularly due to

elevated prices of certain essential food items and

inflation, as measured by the Colombo Consumer

Price Index (CCPI, 2013=100), hovered around

the upper bound of the desired range during early

2020 and accelerated to 6.2 per cent, year-on-year,

by February 2020. However, with the moderation

of food and non-food inflation, year-on-year

headline inflation decelerated and was recorded at

4.2 per cent by end 2020, compared to 4.8 per cent

recorded in December 2019. Headline inflation,

based on the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI,

2013=100), which attaches a relatively high weight

to food items, broadly followed the trend in CCPI

based headline inflation. NCPI based year-on-year

headline inflation decelerated gradually from a peak

of 8.1 per cent in February 2020 to 4.6 per cent

by end 2020, compared to 6.2 per cent recorded

in December 2019. Further, deceleration in both

food and non-food inflation and the statistical effect

of the high base that was recorded in the same

period in 2020 caused CCPI based year-on-year

headline inflation to decline below the lower bound

of the inflation target during the first two months in

2021, before returning to the targeted range and

recording 4.1 per cent by March 2021. Following

inflation, which excludes the subcategories of volatile

food, energy, and transport from headline inflation,

and reflects the underlying inflationary trends by

removing seasonal price fluctuations and the effects

of key administratively determined prices, remained

subdued throughout 2020, as per the CCPI and

the NCPI. Accordingly, year-on-year core inflation

based on the CCPI and the NCPI decelerated to

3.5 per cent and 4.7 per cent, respectively, by end

2020, compared to 4.8 per cent and 5.2 per cent,

recorded at the end of 2019, respectively. Further,

4.3 per cent by March 2021.

External Sector Developments

Sri Lanka’s external sector exhibited

resilience amidst unprecedented uncertainties

during the COVID-19 pandemic, supported

by the measures taken by the Government

and the Central Bank. Merchandise exports,

which declined significantly during the second

quarter of 2020, recovered faster than expected,

reaching pre-pandemic levels by the end of the

year. Merchandise imports declined significantly

in 2020, mainly reflecting the impact of policy

measures to restrict non-essential imports and

relatively low international petroleum prices during

the year. Accordingly, the trade deficit declined

by US dollars 1,989 million to US dollars 6,008

million in 2020, compared to the previous year.

The surplus in the services account also declined

considerably in 2020, compared to 2019, mainly

reflecting the impact of the pandemic on earnings

from tourism. However, the computer services

sector continued to record a healthy growth with

undisrupted functioning of information technology

and business process outsourcing (IT/BPO)

related services during 2020. Overall, the surplus

in the services account declined to US dollars

819 million in 2020, in comparison to US dollars

2,849 million in 2019. The deficit in the primary

income account declined to US dollars 2,101

million in 2020, compared to the deficit of US

dollars 2,462 million in 2019, mainly due to the

reduction in dividend payments and reinvested

earnings of Direct Investment Enterprises (DIEs),

and the reduction in interest payments on foreign

investment in government securities. Workers’

remittances, which recorded a setback at the

onset of the pandemic, recovered steadily in the

second half of the year, registering a healthy

growth, thereby strengthening the surplus in the

secondary income account to US dollars 6,207

million in 2020, compared to US dollars 5,766

million in 2019. With these developments, the

deficit in the external current account narrowed

to US dollars 1,083 million in 2020 (1.3 per cent

of GDP), from US dollars 1,843 million in 2019

(2.2 per cent of GDP). Inflows to the financial

account remained modest in 2020. Major inflows

to the financial account during the year included

the foreign currency term financing facility of US

dollars 500 million from China Development Bank

and US dollars 400 million from the Reserve Bank

countries. Inflows on account of foreign direct

investment (FDI), including foreign loans to DIEs,

remained low at US dollars 670 million in 2020, in

comparison to US dollars 1,189 million in 2019.

Despite the challenges in mobilising external

financing, Sri Lanka continued to maintain its

unblemished record of debt servicing. Sri Lanka

successfully settled the International Sovereign

Bond (ISB) of US dollars 1 billion that matured in

October 2020. The outstanding external debt of

the country, which is a key concern of sovereign

rating agencies, declined to US dollars 49.2 billion

at end 2020 from US dollars 54.8 billion at end

2019, mainly due to the significant decline in

market prices of Sri Lanka’s outstanding ISBs,

maturing of the ISB in October 2020, the increase

in the resident holdings of Sri Lanka's outstanding

ISBs, and the decline in the non resident holding

of rupee denominated government securities

during the year.

The exchange rate remained relatively stable

during 2020, despite intermittent volatilities

at the beginning of the pandemic and again

towards the end of the year. The re-emergence

of exchange rate volatility since late 2020 was

mainly driven by speculative market behaviour due

to sovereign rating downgrades and low levels of

liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market.

The Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indices

remained well below the base year level (2017=100),

indicating external competitiveness. Gross official

reserves declined to US dollars 5.7 billion by end

2020, in comparison to US dollars 7.6 billion recorded

at end 2019, amidst foreign debt service payments

and limited foreign exchange inflows. Overall, the

Central Bank was able to absorb foreign exchange

from the domestic foreign exchange market, on a net

basis, during 2020. The Central Bank continued to

absorb foreign exchange from the domestic foreign

exchange market, in early 2021, supported by the

measures introduced to sell a share of conversions

of workers’ remittances and export proceeds to the

Central Bank by licensed banks.

Fiscal Sector Developments

At the turn of the year, the Government took

a firm decision to conduct fiscal policy with the

intention of stimulating the stagnant economy,

but the fiscal outcome was severely affected by

the pandemic. Amidst numerous challenges, the

Government continued to support businesses and

individuals affected by the pandemic to ensure a

fast recovery of economic activity and return of the

economy to a high growth path. Fiscal operations

in 2020 were carried out under Votes-on-Account

(VoAs) and the authorisation of His Excellency the

President under the provisions of the Constitution,

as the submission of an annual budget for approval

by the Parliament was delayed until November

2020. Government revenue moderated in 2020,

mainly due to weakened revenue streams owing

to the contraction of economic activity as well as

the fiscal stimulus measures implemented via tax

revisions since late 2019. Government revenue as

a percentage of GDP declined to 9.1 per cent from

12.6 per cent in 2019, reflecting the sharp decline

in tax revenue collection. On the expenditure

front, the Ministry of Finance made an adjustment

to fiscal statistics by shifting the expenditure

incurred on payment of arrears amounting to

Rs. 422.6 billion from 2020 to 2019. Accordingly,

total expenditure and net lending were recorded

at 20.3 per cent of GDP in 2020, compared to

22.2 per cent in 2019. However, recurrent

expenditure rose to 17.0 per cent of GDP in

2020 from 16.1 per cent of GDP in 2019, mainly

on account of an increase in salaries and wages,

subsidies and transfers, and interest payments.

Outweighing the impact of the rise in recurrent

expenditure, capital expenditure contracted notably

to 3.3 per cent of GDP in 2020, compared to

6.1 per cent of GDP in 2019.

The effects of the pandemic caused the key

fiscal balances to deteriorate notably in 2020.

The overall budget deficit, as a percentage of GDP,

increased to 11.1 per cent in 2020 from 9.6 per

cent in 2019. The current account deficit, which

reflects dissavings of the Government, increased to

7.9 per cent of GDP in 2020 from 3.6 per cent of

GDP in 2019. Meanwhile, the primary balance,

which excludes interest payments from the overall

budget deficit and reflects the discretionary

component of fiscal policy, recorded a deficit of 4.6

per cent of GDP in 2020, compared to the deficit

of 3.6 per cent of GDP in 2019. The outstanding

central government debt increased to 101.0 per

cent of GDP (Rs. 15,117.2 billion) by end 2020,

compared to 86.8 per cent of GDP (Rs. 13,031.5

billion) at end 2019, reflecting the combined impact

of the increase in the outstanding debt stock as

well as the contraction of GDP during the year. The

relative share of foreign debt in total debt declined to

40.0 per cent by end 2020 from 47.6 per cent at end

2019, as the Government financed the budget deficit

through domestic sources during 2020, reflecting

the expressed preference of the Government for

domestic financing over foreign financing as well

as the limited access to foreign financing amidst

unfavourable global market conditions. Despite

adverse speculation of rating agencies, the

Government settled all its debt servicing obligations

in 2020, including the settlement of the ISB of US

dollars 1 billion in October 2020.

Monetary Sector Developments

The Central Bank continued to relax the

monetary policy stance during 2020 with a view

to supporting the economy to recover from the

effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and to regain

the growth momentum, given the subdued

inflation conditions. The key policy interest rates,

i.e., the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR)

and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR),

were reduced by a total of 250 basis points on

five occasions to their historically lowest levels of

4.50 per cent and 5.50 per cent, respectively,

during 2020. The SRR applicable on rupee deposit

liabilities of LCBs was reduced on two

occasions by a total of 3 percentage points to

2.00 per cent during 2020, thereby increasing

liquidity in the domestic money market amidst

heightened uncertainty emanating from cashflow

disruptions and urgent funding requirements

of financial institutions. Meanwhile, in order to

signal the availability of emergency funding for the

financial sector at an affordable cost, the Central

Bank reduced the Bank Rate by a total of 650

basis points to 8.50 per cent during 2020, while

allowing it to be determined automatically with

a margin of 300 basis points above the SLFR.

Further, the Central Bank implemented regulatory

measures to reduce excessive interest rates

charged on certain financial products, including

credit cards and pawning, thereby quickening the

monetary policy transmission process and helping

marginal borrowers. A maximum interest rate of

7.00 per cent per annum was imposed on mortgage-

backed housing loans for a tenure of at least five

years for salaried employees in both public and

private sectors. Reflecting the impact of these

policy, operational and regulatory measures,

aggregate market lending rates declined to historic

lows, with new lending rates declining to single

digits levels, on average. Market deposit rates also

decreased substantially, causing some deposit

products to generate negative real returns, despite

low levels of inflation. Meanwhile, the Central Bank

implemented concessional loan schemes under the

Saubagya COVID-19 Renaissance Facility, enabling

licensed banks to grant working capital loans at a

concessional rate of 4.00 per cent to businesses

affected by the pandemic. Considering the cashflow

difficulties of the Government amidst the pandemic,

the Central Bank extended financial support to

the Government, mainly by purchasing Treasury

bills from the primary market. This contributed

towards increasing surplus market liquidity, while

also facilitating a notable reduction in yields on

government securities during 2020, amidst the

accommodative monetary policy stance. With

improving market sentiments and the reduction in

lending rates, a gradual recovery in credit to the

private sector by LCBs was observed towards late

2020. Credit to the private sector increased by

Rs. 374.1 billion during 2020, recording a growth

of 6.5 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2020. In April

2021, the Central Bank also introduced targets for

banks on lending to micro, small and medium scale

enterprises (MSMEs) in priority sectors. Meanwhile,

credit to the public sector increased substantially

during the year, primarily reflecting the notable

increase in net credit to the government, resulting

in a rapid expansion of broad money supply. The

Central Bank conducted monetary policy under its

flexible inflation targeting (FIT) framework, which

allowed anchoring of inflation expectations on the

one hand, and supporting the revival of the economy

on the other, given the prevailing negative output

gap and the restrictions on non-essential imports

and other foreign exchange outflows.

Financial Sector Developments

The stability of Sri Lanka’s financial system

was preserved amidst uncertainties and

challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The banking sector exhibited moderate growth

despite risks emerging from the challenging

economic environment due to the effects of the

pandemic. The deterioration in credit quality

and the moderation of foreign exchange inflows

due to the pandemic remained the major

macroprudential concerns on banking sector

operations. Meanwhile, the sluggish performance

of the Licensed Finance Companies (LFCs) and

Specialised Leasing Companies (SLCs) sector

was reflected through the decline in the asset

base, credit and deposits, and profitability, and

the increase in non performing loans (NPLs)

during the year, mainly due to the pandemic

related impediments and the deterioration in

public confidence. The Central Bank provided a

number of regulatory forbearances with a view

to managing the adverse impact of the above

outcomes on the banking sector and the LFCs and

SLCs sector, while implementing extraordinary

policy measures to provide relief to businesses

and individuals affected by the pandemic. Other

institutional sectors in the financial system, such

as insurance and provident funds, recorded a

mixed performance. The Central Bank ensured

the availability of liquidity in the money market,

particularly considering the need to support the

financial system, thereby facilitating economic

activities amidst the pandemic. Subdued

foreign exchange inflows due to the pandemic

exerted pressure on the exchange rate, which

was managed mainly through restrictions on

foreign exchange outflows. The Colombo Stock

Exchange (CSE) recovered from the significant

decline recorded at the onset of the pandemic,

to record a notable improvement since mid-July

2020, supported by the improved appetite of

domestic investors for equity investment, despite

net outflows of foreign investment from the CSE

in 2020.

1.3 Global Economic Environment and Outlook

In 2020, the global economy recorded its

worst recession in decades. According to the

World Economic Outlook (WEO) of the International

Monetary Fund (IMF), released in April 2021, the

global economy contracted by 3.3 per cent in 2020,

compared to a growth of 2.8 per cent in 2019. During

2020, advanced economies were estimated to have

contracted by 4.7 per cent, while a contraction of

2.2 per cent was estimated in relation to emerging

market and developing economies. Meanwhile, in

China, where the COVID-19 pandemic originated,

the economy recorded a growth of 2.3 per cent

in 2020. Unparalleled policy support on several

fronts, including health, fiscal, monetary and social,

facilitated an upturn in most economies towards the

second half of 2020.

Extensive policy support at national and

multilateral levels and the successful rollout

of the COVID-19 vaccination programme

have raised optimism about the expeditious

recovery of global economic activity, despite

uncertainties. Projections for global growth for

the next few years have been revised upward by

the IMF to 6.0 per cent in 2021 and 4.4 per cent in

2022, reflecting a stronger-than-expected recovery

from the pandemic. However, the global economic

recovery is expected to vary across and within

regions, attributed to variations in the magnitude

of disruptions, the size and effectiveness of

policies, pre-pandemic fiscal and socioeconomic

conditions, and coverage of vaccine rollout.

Advanced economies are expected to recover

faster than most emerging market economies,

due to increased access to vaccines and large

policy space available to maintain accommodative

macroeconomic policies for an extended period.

Accordingly, advanced economies are projected

to grow by 5.1 per cent and 3.6 per cent, in 2021

and 2022, respectively. The United States is

projected to grow by 6.4 per cent in 2021 and by

3.5 per cent in 2022, compared to the contraction

of 3.5 per cent in 2020, supported by large fiscal

support and continued monetary accommodation.

Growth in the euro area is projected to pick

up from a contraction of 6.6 per cent in 2020 to

4.4 per cent in 2021 and 3.8 per cent in 2022. In

the United Kingdom, economic activity is expected

to record a growth of 5.3 per cent in 2021.

Emerging market and developing economies are

projected to record a strong growth of 6.7 per cent

in 2021. However, the expected recovery of these

economies is subject to regional differences in the

severity of the pandemic, idiosyncratic features

of their economies and health systems, exposure

to specific shocks, such as those on commodity

exports or tourism, and policy space available to

aggressively respond to the pandemic. Emerging

and Developing Asia, which contracted by

1.0 per cent in 2020, is expected to grow by

8.6 per cent in 2021, driven by expected high

growth of China and India. The Chinese economy

is expected to grow by 8.4 per cent in 2021, while

the growth projection for India is 12.5 per cent.

Meanwhile, global oil prices are expected to

increase in 2021 due to demand-supply

mismatches, with risks to the projection being

on the upside. Global inflation is expected to be

subdued in the near term, reflecting the staggered

revival of aggregate demand and subdued wage

growth. Notably, in most advanced and emerging

market economies, inflation expectations appear

to be well-anchored, supported by the improved

monetary frameworks.

Global growth projections entail significant

risks due to the uncertainties associated with

the pandemic, despite being tilted to the upside

over the medium term. Major upside risks include

expedited vaccine production and rollout, strong

fiscal support and well-coordinated fiscal and other

economic policies along with strong international

cooperation. Major downside risks include the

possibility of resurgence of the pandemic, tighter

financial conditions, substantial and persistent

damage to supply potential, intensified social

unrest, natural disasters, and geopolitical, trade

and technology risks.

1.4 Medium Term Macroeconomic Outlook

The Sri Lankan economy is expected to

rebound strongly in 2021 and sustain the high

growth momentum over the medium term,

buoyed by growth oriented policy support.

The impact of the pro-growth policy agenda of the

Government and the accommodative monetary

policy stance of the Central Bank are expected to

contribute to the growth of the economy in 2021,

supported by the effect of the low base. The local

and international vaccination drive and the return of

most economic activities to normalcy are expected

to help the economy to achieve a high growth rate

in 2021. The spillover effects from the expected

recovery of the global economy would positively

impact external demand, inflows of workers’

remittances, portfolio investment, and FDIs. The

Government’s efforts towards strengthening the

production economy will support domestic agrarian

production, agro- and natural resource-based

industries and other emerging industries and

services, and improve overall productivity of the

economy as well. Measures to foster self sufficiency

in key agrarian products, with necessary protection

against dumping and other malpractices, would

encourage domestic producers to make long term

investment in large scale farming and production

facilities. While the export-oriented manufacturing

sectors are expected to be strengthened with the

establishment of dedicated industrial zones, the

opening up of the Colombo Port City for foreign and

domestic investment would bolster the country’s

services sector, in particular. Further, the task forces

established for the purpose of strengthening export

earnings, with the participation of public and private

stakeholders, are expected to support earmarked

export sectors. Further, the benefits of the fiscal

stimuli provided in the form of substantial tax reliefs

and subsidies are expected to materialise in the

near term, through the improvement of profitability

of firms and the enhancement of investment

capacity. The notable reduction of interest rates, and

the resultant low cost of borrowing would help pave

the way for high growth with the active participation

of the private sector in the period ahead. The high

growth momentum is expected to persist over the

medium term, supported by expeditious measures

aimed at expanding the production possibility

frontier and resolving structural impediments in

the economy, including the rigid doing business

environment, and also by maintaining policy

consistency and macroeconomic stability, and

envisaged improvements in the external sector

through the expected revival of exports of goods

and services and financial flows.

While cautious management of external

sector pressures in the near term is crucial

in maintaining macroeconomic stability, the

implementation of policies to strengthen non

debt creating foreign exchange inflows is

expected to improve the resilience of the sector

in the medium term. Earnings from exports are

expected to strengthen in the period ahead with

the envisaged recovery in global demand and the

policy drive to improve the tradable sector. To

manage the near term pressures in the external

sector, close management of expenditure

on imports is expected in 2021, although

higher petroleum prices and the recovery of

domestic economic activity are likely to increase

expenditure on imports somewhat during the year.

Expenditure on imports is expected to increase

over the medium term with the envisaged

expansion of domestic demand and exports,

although the expected improvements in the

domestic supply of consumer and intermediate

goods may dampen the demand for such imports.

The envisaged improvement in earnings from

exports is expected to result in a contraction of

the trade deficit in the medium term. The surplus

in the services account is expected to improve,

underpinned by the recovery of the tourism

industry with the reopening of the borders to

international tourists and the expected relaxation

of travel restrictions globally. Further, the rebound

of activities in transport services and the expected

high growth in the IT/BPO services subsector is

expected to support trade in services over the

medium term. The growth momentum of workers’

remittances is expected to continue, supported

by the prospective rebound of global activity, and

the measures implemented by the Government to

encourage foreign employment of skilled workers,

alongside the incentive framework for migrant

workers that is being put in place. With the expected

improvements in the merchandise and services

exports and workers’ remittances, the external

current account is expected to improve in 2021 to

record a marginal deficit, strictly conditional on the

continuation of close management of expenditure

on non-essential imports and the recovery of

global tourism flows in the second half of the

year. The external current account is expected to

improve to record surpluses over the medium term,

backed by the measures that are being introduced

by the Government to promote merchandise

and services exports, alongside strengthened

institutional support. It is also expected that the

planned increased reliance on renewable energy

sources for power generation and improvements

in public transportation systems will also contribute

to the management of the total energy import

bill in the future. The expected improvement in

investor sentiment would help attract financial

flows, including FDI inflows, portfolio investments

to the CSE and the government securities market,

as the effects of the pandemic dissipate over the

period ahead. Major inflows of foreign investment

are expected to the Colombo Port City and the

Industrial Zone projects, among others. The

improvement in the current account balance and

enhanced non debt financial flows are expected

to strengthen the gross official reserves over

the medium term, while easing pressure on the

domestic foreign exchange market. The near term

need to meet large foreign currency debt service

payments of the Government is expected to be

fulfilled with the support of bilateral and multilateral

sources of financing, while ongoing improvements

in the external debt profile and efforts to enhance

non debt creating foreign exchange inflows are

expected to ensure the sustainability of Sri Lanka’s

external debt in the period ahead.

In line with the Government’s policy agenda,

the fiscal sector is expected to improve over the

medium term, underpinned by the envisaged

revival of economic activity. The business friendly

tax regime, which was put in place from end 2019,

is expected to continue over the medium term,

thereby facilitating a gradual increase of government

revenue as businesses and other economic

activities continue to expand. The expected rebound

of government revenue would also be facilitated by

revenue administration reforms to strengthen the

tax net. Government expenditure, as a percentage

of GDP, is expected to moderate, facilitated by

the rationalisation of recurrent expenditure and

improved efficiency of capital expenditure in the

period ahead. The fiscal burden stemming from

underperforming State Owned Business Enterprises

(SOBEs) is expected to be reduced with productivity

improvements and enhanced managerial efficiency.

Although the need for fiscal support for economic

activities to recover from the effects of the COVID-19

pandemic would keep the budget deficit elevated in

the near term, it is expected to decline to 4.0 per cent

of GDP over the medium term with the envisaged

improvements on the government revenue and

expenditure fronts. Meanwhile, the reliance of deficit

17

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

financing on foreign sources would be minimised

in line with the expressed preference of the

Government to reduce exposure to foreign liabilities.

Measures have already been taken to streamline

foreign funded public investment projects, while

encouraging public-private partnerships, thereby

lessening the debt burden of the Government.

Consequently, the outstanding debt of the Central

Government is expected to gradually reduce from

the current elevated levels to around 80 per cent

of GDP by the year 2025. In line with the change

in the deficit financing strategy, foreign currency

debt servicing of the Government is also expected

to decline over the medium term. Commitment

to improving the fiscal sector performance over

the medium term is expected, in order to ensure

sustained macroeconomic stability and to prevent

disruptions to the envisaged high growth path.

With proactive policies to rollback any

excessive policy stimulus when aggregate

demand conditions normalise, inflation is

anticipated to be maintained within the targeted

range over the medium term. Inflation is projected

to hover around lower single digit levels during

most of 2021, reflecting the slack in economic

activity. The impact of accommodative monetary

policy and fiscal stimulus measures, which were

targeted at reviving the economy affected by the

pandemic, is expected to induce a gradual buildup

of aggregate demand and demand driven pressures

on inflation. The rebound of global energy prices

and rising global food prices could cause direct and

second-round inflationary pressures across the

globe. In the meantime, benefiting from continued

commitment and policies of the Government

targeted at revitalising the economy through

enhanced production and measures to control

the cost of living, muted supply driven inflationary

pressures are foreseen over the medium term.

However, possible weather related disturbances are

likely to result in transitory volatilities in food prices,

which must be addressed by strengthening supply

chain management. Adherence to the envisaged

fiscal consolidation path by the Government as

well as appropriate monetary policy adjustments

made in a forward-looking manner as economic

conditions normalise, will help stabilise inflation

and anchor inflation expectations in the 4-6 per

cent range over the medium term within the FIT

framework.

The envisaged low inflation environment

will help the maintenance of the low interest

rate structure, facilitating credit flows to the

private sector at reasonable cost and thereby

supporting the expected high economic

growth, while providing a reasonable real

return to savers. The growth of credit to the private

sector is projected to accelerate, supported by the

prevailing historically low market lending rates, the

revival of economic activity buttressed by fiscal and

monetary stimuli and the focused efforts to support

the MSME sector. The envisaged expansion of

credit to the private sector together with the likely

increase in credit to the public sector from the

banking system is expected to cause the growth

of broad money supply to remain elevated in 2021,

and moderate thereafter over the medium term

aided by the gradual rollback of policy stimulus as

economic growth accelerates. Such moderation

of fiscal and monetary expansion will not impede

the envisaged growth path, as economic growth

in the medium term is expected to be driven by

productivity improvements and the removal of

structural impediments and bottlenecks to growth.

The Central Bank will continue to closely monitor

the monetary and macroeconomic developments

and undertake proactive policy interventions to

arrest any undue surge in aggregate demand

18

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2020

1

generated through excessive monetary expansion,

while reacting to slippages in terms of foreign

exchange outflows and fiscal outcomes. In the

meantime, the Central Bank will also continue to

take steps to channel credit to priority sectors of

the economy, particularly segments that display

high potential for domestic growth and export

earnings. The expansion of credit at reasonable

cost to such segments, which would mostly

contain MSMEs, would support the development

of an entrepreneurship culture within Sri Lanka,

and promote inclusive and sustained growth.

While the prevailing low interest rate structure

presents tremendous opportunities for new and

existing business ventures, it also poses significant

challenges for economically vulnerable groups that

rely on incomes from interest-bearing deposits.

The increased focus towards the introduction of

safe and alternative financial products that yield

reasonably high returns would benefit savers who

are adversely affected by the low interest rates.

In this context, the financial sector as a whole,

is expected to play a proactive role in effective

financial intermediation, by developing innovative

products to fulfil the needs of the borrowers as well

as savers.

1.5 Issues and Policies

Improvements in the Sri Lankan economy

over the medium term are expected to be driven

by the implementation of the Government’s

novel economic policy framework based on

Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour, which aims

at addressing longstanding macroeconomic

imbalances and ensuring equitable, shared

and sustained economic growth. While the

monetary and financial measures by themselves

cannot ensure economic revival and regaining of

the growth momentum, wide-ranging economic

reforms undertaken by the Government are

essential for the country’s continued progress. For

several decades, the Sri Lankan economy has

grappled with numerous structural impediments to

growth and macroeconomic stability. Despite the

widespread recognition among policymakers and

analysts about the need for reform, the needed

reforms have been postponed repeatedly. This

is reflected in the country’s incessant twin deficit

burden from the fiscal and external sectors. On the

one hand, export earnings have stagnated over the

years without much improvement in the production

base in the tradable sector, diversification of

products and markets, integration into global

and regional value chains and on exploiting the

untapped potential of services exports. On the

other hand, import expenditure has continued

to escalate due to the dependence of industrial

exports on imported raw materials and thereby the

inelastic nature of demand for such products, the

increasing demand for imported goods from the

growing middle class and the increasing demand

for petroleum for power generation and transport

activities. While workers’ remittance flows have

cushioned the external current account deficit,

the low level of FDI flows has led to the excessive

reliance on external borrowings to bridge the

gap between savings and investment. On the

fiscal front, the economy has been grappling with

high and rigid expenditure and persistently low

revenue mobilisation largely due to the lack of any

sizeable expansion in the tax base and weak tax

administration. The resultant expansion in the fiscal

deficit has led to the rapid accumulation of debt to

disconcerting levels. The COVID-19 pandemic has

exacerbated these incessant economic concerns.

However, the pandemic has also offered an

opportunity to reset the economy’s focus and to

address these longstanding structural weaknesses

and establish a production based, productivity

driven economy. In this context, the Government’s

19

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

policy focus on building a strong domestic

production economy that is export oriented and

capable of effectively catering to the growing

domestic demand, is a welcome transformation.

The Central Bank’s maintenance of a low interest

environment will also enable domestic ventures to

benefit from the Government’s pro-growth policies

focused on expanding the productive potential of

the economy. Improved domestic production can

help increase household incomes, paving way

for an expansion in the tax base and revenue

collection in the period ahead, thereby supporting

the planned fiscal consolidation path over the

medium term. A key initiative that is underway is

the effort to improve the production capacity of

the economy and to strengthen non debt creating

foreign exchange flows to sectors with export

potential, with the active participation of the public

and private sector stakeholders in the relevant

sectors. National level recognition of these deep-

rooted structural problems and the initiatives taken

thus far to address them are appreciable. Timely

implementation of suitable and coherent policies

to redress these issues is vital for the economy

to rapidly progress on the envisaged high growth

trajectory in a sustainable manner.

Sluggish improvement in productivity

remains a major challenge for sustained

economic growth of Sri Lanka. The country

demands more planned and determined efforts to

remove bottlenecks in increasing productivity in

order to achieve sustained high growth. Productivity

improvements in the traditional agriculture sector

remain a priority in ensuring equitable growth

and development. Substantially low levels of

productivity have adverse effects on incomes

of farmers and other workers in the agriculture

sector. Increasing economies of scale, promoting

modern technology based agriculture, adopting

smart farming technologies for efficient usage of

resources, such as Good Agricultural Practices

(GAP) and Geographic Information Systems

(GIS), and efficiently connecting farmers with

supply chains are among the major aspects that

could enhance the productivity of the agriculture

sector. Further, utilisation of nanotechnology for

soil improvement and crop disease diagnosis,

promoting hydroponics methods, selecting

hybridised and high yielding crops, improved post

harvesting treatment techniques for packaging,

storage and distribution would also help improve

productivity in the agriculture sector. Productivity

improvements in the industry sector also remain

sluggish compared to regional peers. Major

factors that hinder productivity improvements in

the industry sector include high energy and labour

intensity, barriers for small and medium scale

enterprises (SMEs) to establish and develop,

obstacles in attracting FDIs and inadequate

investment in research and development (R&D).

Improving technical competencies of the labour

force, establishing industrial zones and introducing

agglomeration economic policies, and enhancing

innovative capacities are among the major factors

that could allow the industrial sector to achieve

high efficiency levels and benefit from improved

productivity. In the services sector, process

and product innovation and adoption of new

technologies remain vital for productivity

improvements. Adoption of the latest technology

and better management practices would help

resolve productivity related issues that result

in the underutilisation of existing resources. In

addition, adoption of new technology, particularly

in the backdrop of the Fourth Industrial Revolution

(4IR), use of data and decisive technologies, such

as Machine Learning, Artificial Neural Networks

(ANN) and Internet of Things (IoT), would

essentially enhance the productivity of all sectors

of the economy. Knowledge workforce is an

important lever that Sri Lanka could use to increase

20

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2020

1

productivity. Knowledge workers boost capabilities

of industries to fully utilise the available resources

and allow adoption of new technologies, while

improving the innovative capacity of the economy

and raising the quality of jobs. Thus, policy

reforms are necessary to promote industry related

vocational training, and re-skilling of labour. This

would also include reforms for improving the quality

of teaching, and enhancing the scope of education,

thereby facilitating productivity improvements,

both in the public sector and the private sector, in

the period ahead. In the meantime, traditional job

creation and seniority based promotion policies

at public institutions need a strategic breakaway

with increased attention paid to employee skills

development and technological enhancement.

Prioritised export promotion is essential,

alongside taking measures to implement

long overdue structural reforms to address

legacy issues and revive the export sector.

Although Sri Lanka recorded its historically highest

export earnings in 2019 prior to the pandemic hit

performance in 2020, such earnings are meagre

when compared to those recorded by similar-sized

economies in the region. Steering the export sector

through the impact of the pandemic and fostering

competitiveness in the new global environment

are essential, while catching up with peers. In

this regard, in the short term, prioritising export

promotion in selected sectors, i.e., potential winning

industries of the country, will drive the overall export

performance, while enhancing domestic production.

Concentrating on earmarked subsectors rather than

the whole export sector could yield speedy results.

Such results are imperative, given the pressing and

urgent requirement of improving export earnings

to support the external sector. In this regard, the

focused sectors identified in the National Export

Strategy and by the Presidential Task Force of

Economic Revival and Poverty Alleviation could be

a starting point. Such potential winning industries

include pharmaceuticals, rubber products, coconut

related products, spices, electronics and electrical

components, ship and boat building, food and

beverages, cosmetics, toys, machinery and

mechanical appliances and ceramic products,

among others. Additionally, appropriate revisions

to the import tariff regime and other taxes,

such as corporate tax, could be used to boost

selected economic sectors and also to discourage

undesirable sectors with marginal domestic value

addition. Further, coordinated efforts on branding

not only for the country but also for targeted export

products are imperative. In the medium term, it is

vital to develop policies to diversify exports, in terms

of both products and markets. Exploring new export

opportunities to upgrade Sri Lanka's export base

towards high value added technologically intensive

exports remains important. Lack of export oriented

FDI flows is also an impediment to the growth of the

export sector. Consistent economic policies, stable

macroeconomic conditions, a competitive exchange

rate, low and stable interest rates, improving doing

business conditions, and appropriate management

of foreign relations are necessary to enhance

investor confidence in the export sector, to attract

FDI flows to export oriented winning industries, and

to resolve the numerous legacy issues that straddle

performance of the export sector.

Enhancing services exports through

exploiting their untapped potential in a productive

manner remains a key strategy for improving

Sri Lanka’s external current account outcome.

Vulnerability of earnings from tourism to unexpected

domestic and global disruptions has highlighted the

need to diversify services exports to other services

with high potential, while continuing to harness the

full potential of the tourism sector. IT/BPO, transport

services, financial services and other professional

services are key services export sectors that

21

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

Sri Lanka can and must focus on beyond tourism,

in order to enhance foreign exchange earnings on

a sustainable basis. The IT/BPO sector possesses

enormous undiscovered potential to become a

global industry, benefiting from the ongoing global

digitalisation, with its commercial attractiveness,

and access to skilled labour coupled with improving

Information and Communication Technology

(ICT) related infrastructure. IT/BPO/ICT sectors

performed well during the pandemic, all over the

world. However, in Sri Lanka, earnings of this sector

remained relatively low compared to regional peers

with similar capabilities, primarily due to the lack of

promotion and branding of Sri Lanka as a digital

nation. Building such an image would help promote

FDIs and attract leading global IT firms to set up

regional headquarters in Sri Lanka, which would

substantially enhance foreign exchange inflows

to the country. The unfavourable ease of doing

business rankings affect FDIs and other start-up

investments in this sector as well. Furthermore, the

unavailability of international payment gateways for

inward foreign exchange flows affects SMEs in this

sector. In addition to bringing in foreign exchange

to the country, this sector would provide job

opportunities, especially for the younger workforce

and females in the country, offering higher earning

potential and flexible working conditions. Although

the country possesses a talented, young workforce,

it is insufficient to meet the required demand from

the industry. Sri Lanka could be actively promoted

as a working hub for highly paid IT professionals and

digital nomads, competing with other popular hubs

in the region. Meanwhile, the strategic location of

Sri Lanka in the Indian Ocean provides the country

with a massive opportunity to emerge as a maritime

and logistics hub in Asia. The addition of the East

Container Terminal along with the expeditious

development of the West Container Terminal would

improve the volumes of container, transshipment

and cargo handling, thereby increasing earnings

from port services. Improving the export of financial

services is also a feasible option for Sri Lanka.

Development of the Colombo Port City as a financial

hub is expected to bolster financial services exports,

thereby increasing export earnings.

Innovative strategies to entice both

international and domestic tourists are

necessary to keep the tourism sector functioning

in the new normal that has been created by

the pandemic. Sri Lanka opened its borders for

international tourists in January 2021, after being

closed for 10 months, using the innovative concept

of “bio-bubbles”, where the health and safety of both

international tourists and the local communities are

ensured through strict social distancing, while also

avoiding quarantine requirements for tourists. While

the pandemic persists, bio-bubbles can be expanded

to include more authorised accommodation

providers and tourist sites, while inviting tourists of

many different countries to visit Sri Lanka. Further,

regional bio-bubbles can be negotiated with

countries like the Maldives, which has opened up

for tourism, while creating travel corridors with other

countries. At the same time, increasing opportunities

for those who have been vaccinated against

COVID-19 to travel without testing and quarantining

can also be explored. Meanwhile, there is further

space to develop local tourism in Sri Lanka to help

the tourism sector, especially the informal sector,

as it is mostly the formal sector that can operate

under bio-bubbles. Additionally, the promotion of

local tourism could also reduce the number of Sri

Lankans from travelling abroad for leisure, thereby

helping to minimise foreign currency outflows. In

this regard, tourism related authorities should work

with the private sector to improve domestic tourism

further, through measures such as scheduled tour

packages for weekends, customised tours for

different age groups, educational tours, and retreats

and tours for different income groups. Further, there

22

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2020

1

is also a need to create more user friendly and

localised information portals on local attractions

and information on arranged tours for locals. At

the same time, connectivity can be enhanced by

providing transportation to tourist sites from city

centres. Moreover, the country needs to make use

of the opportunity created in the pandemic period

to address issues that have kept some tourists

away in the past, such as concerns on personal

safety, lack of facilities at tourist sites, having to buy

costly tickets at individual tourist attractions, noise

pollution, and overcrowding. Further, reducing the

informality in the sector and introducing insurance

schemes and social safety mechanisms for those

who are engaged in the sector are imperative to

build the resilience of the sector to face unexpected

challenges, locally or internationally, especially if the

sector is to expand further over the medium term.

Additionally, mechanisms to recover due taxes from

unregulated accommodation providers and other

service providers, including websites that provide

a platform for tourism services to be marketed for

a fee, must be developed and strictly executed.

Immediate attention for the timely implementation

of such measures would help the tourism sector to

develop in the face of the new normal, while building

resilience of the sector to sustain as a major foreign

exchange earner of the country.

The Colombo Port City, the first of its kind

in South Asia, is expected to bring numerous

socioeconomic benefits to the country,

conditional on the country’s ability to attract

strategic investments by offering an investor

friendly atmosphere expeditiously. The Colombo

Port City is being developed with a modern business

atmosphere that can compete with other popular

investment hubs, such as Dubai, Singapore and Hong

Kong, to attract investors, entrepreneurs, innovators,

companies, and financial institutions through a well

structured and competitive legal, tax and regulatory,

and dispute resolution mechanism. Despite there

being many financial service centres in the world,

the Colombo Port City has the proximity advantage to

major cities in South Asia and East Asia. Expected

foreign investment flows to the Colombo Port City

would be critical to finance the balance of payments

(BOP) of the country over the medium term. Further,

this project is expected to support the national

economy, through the generation of employment

opportunities, while contributing to economic growth

and government revenue. Additionally, as Colombo is

popular for its favourable living conditions compared

to other cities in South Asia and with the pool of

skilled workforce, it is expected that the Colombo

Port City project will create high quality employment

opportunities, which would also reduce the issue of

brain drain faced by the country. In the meantime,

there is a dire need to maintain policy consistency,

improve doing business conditions and expedite

approval and the implementation processes to

facilitate FDIs as planned with the establishment of

the Colombo Port City Commission, which would

enable Sri Lanka to successfully compete with other

financial hubs in the world.

The country’s continued failure to attract

sizeable FDIs highlights the structural,

institutional and policy impediments that need

to be addressed urgently, while maintaining a

consistent policy framework with a long term

view. Unlike other capital flows, FDIs embody

many desirable features, such as the transfer of

technology, providing a boost to foreign exchange

earnings and the development of human capital

through technical and managerial know-how.

Further, FDIs facilitate integrating with regional and

global value chains, infrastructure development and

technology innovation, while creating employment

opportunities and enabling access to new markets.

FDIs are generally a long term source of funds to

an economy, compared to other financial flows,

23

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

such as portfolio investments and debt flows.

Many countries that have attracted substantial

levels of FDIs over the past decade have been

able to maintain foreign borrowings at manageable

levels, thereby maintaining their external debt at

sustainable levels. Attracting a high level of FDIs,

mainly to tradable sectors and infrastructure,

would be the way forward for Sri Lanka to improve

external debt sustainability. Developing the

Colombo Port City, promoting the Colombo and

Hambantota ports as commodity trading hubs

and establishing modern investment zones for

local and foreign private investors, are expected

to attract considerable foreign investments to the

country in the period ahead. In this context, while

the expected FDIs to these identified projects

must be expedited, continuous dialogue with

potential investors to attract investments beyond

these zones should also be prioritised. To sustain

a healthy momentum of FDIs over the medium

term, implementing structural and policy reforms

to address the issues that hindered the receipt of

FDIs over the past several decades must be

pursued as a national priority. Sri Lanka’s doing

business ranking remains low, regardless of

the measures taken to improve the rankings.

Therefore, concerted efforts are necessary to

expedite improving the doing business environment

and remove unnecessary bureaucratic delays

in investment approval and implementation

processes. There are several areas Sri Lanka

should improve in order to attract high levels of

FDIs in the future, including the establishment of

a coherent investment policy, enhancing efficiency

seeking FDIs as well as market seeking investment,

establishment of investment legislation on par with

international best practices, labour and land market

reforms, developing a monitoring and evaluation

framework, improving investment promotion

activities, effective management and development

of economic zones, establishing an effective

mechanism to address investor grievances,

and systematic evaluation of the effectiveness

of investment incentives. There should also be

a transparent mechanism for investors to stay

updated about the possible areas of investment

and the relevant legal frameworks applicable for

such investment.

Improving the external current account

balance and the fiscal balance is necessary to

continue reversing the expansion in external

debt, in order to ensure macroeconomic

stability and prevent disruptions to long term

economic growth. For many decades, Sri Lanka

has been experiencing twin deficits, namely,

deficits in the government budget and deficits in

the external current account, emanating from

imbalances in the country’s fiscal and external

sectors. High budget deficits have been propelled

by rigid government expenditure and relatively

low growth in government revenue. External current

account deficits have been magnified by large

trade deficits. This has worsened in recent years

with merchandise imports being twice as much

as merchandise exports, in value. Maintaining a

reasonable trade deficit is considered usual for a

small emerging market economy like Sri Lanka,

although a gradually worsening trade deficit is

detrimental to any economy. The current account

deficit is reflected in the savings-investment gap,

which has necessitated the country to seek foreign

capital to finance investment activities. The real

issue is not twin deficits per se, but how a country

is financing such deficits. For example, many

economies with twin deficits manage to finance

such deficits through non debt creating means.

However, in Sri Lanka, these deficits have been

mostly financed through external borrowings,

thereby leading to a vicious cycle. The vulnerability

of Sri Lanka’s external sector was amplified further

in 2020 by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,

24

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2020

1

which has resulted in much needed foreign flows

drying up, including income from tourism, while

limiting access to the international capital market.

As already recognised by the Government,

improving the domestic production economy and

attracting more non debt creating flows remain vital

for Sri Lanka to break this vicious cycle. Initiatives

have already been taken by the Government to

this end, but in the short run, several additional

measures, such as the continuation of restrictions,

to suppress the expenditure on non-essential

imports and other foreign exchange outflows, may

be needed. Focused facilitation effort to improve

the doing business environment is necessary

to attract FDIs, prioritising the export oriented

manufacturing sector. Meanwhile, efforts are

necessary to improve domestic savings through

the introduction of innovative financial products in

the context of the low interest rate environment,

while minimising dissavings by the Government.

Major fiscal challenges that need to be

addressed by the Government include the

persistently low revenue, rigid recurrent

expenditure, rising gross financing needs and

the resultant elevated debt level, as well as

the need to improve the financial performance

of SOBEs. Tax revenue mobilisation has been

impeded by various tax exemptions/holidays, tax

evasion and weak tax administration for decades.

Certain tax reforms introduced by the Government

are aimed at addressing these issues, despite the

near term setback due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The adverse near term impact on tax revenue

collection due to the fiscal stimulus measures is

expected to be offset by the envisaged rebound of

economic activity in the period ahead. It is imperative

to enhance government revenue by improving the tax

base and simplifying documentation requirements in

the tax system, while strengthening the capacity for

risk based revenue administration to improve tax

compliance, within a simple, efficient, and equitable

tax system as envisaged by the Government.

Meanwhile, the rising share of non discretionary

fiscal expenses, such as interest payments, salaries

and wages, and pension payments, continues

to add pressure on fiscal operations, thereby

challenging the expenditure rationalisation plans

of the Government. Relatively large government

expenditure, given the low revenue mobilisation

and tightening financial conditions, has resulted

in high budget deficits, necessitating effective

management of government expenditure to avoid

significant stresses in the period ahead with

increasing borrowing requirements, coupled with

large debt service payments of the Government

falling due in the near to medium term. This

underscores the need for deficit financing through

non expansionary sources in the period ahead.

Past efforts towards fiscal consolidation by phasing

out the relatively high fiscal deficit and government

debt have fallen short of expectations. Against this

backdrop, the Government needs to strike a fair

balance between firming up fiscal consolidation

and continuing the facilitation of the envisaged

economic recovery and growth in the period ahead.

Policy adjustments in the period ahead

must give due consideration to the fact that the

COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate

impact on underprivileged segments of the

population and has aggravated inequalities,

not only related to income, but also in relation

to other aspects that affect socioeconomic

wellbeing in the short run and productivity in

the long run. As observed across the world and in

Sri Lanka, COVID-19 has not had a uniform impact

on everyone. The most vulnerable segments have

been low wage workers in low income households

whose nature of employment neither allows for ‘work

from home’ options nor provides any paid leave. In

terms of income inequalities, Sri Lanka has seen

25

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

little change over the past several decades, despite

the substantial decline in poverty. Between the

household survey rounds of 1953 and 2016, there

has been little change in the share of household

income received by the poorest 20 per cent. When

considering the Household Income and Expenditure

Survey (HIES) rounds from 1980/81 till 2016, the

Gini coefficient has stagnated in the range of

0.43-0.48. Considering the loss of livelihoods and

incomes from employment during the pandemic,

income inequalities are likely to have worsened,

despite the several relief measures that were

granted by the Government, which may have

helped maintain the living standards of recipients

to some extent under trying conditions. In recent

years, there have also been several concerns

highlighted about the targeting and thereby efficacy

of the Government’s poverty alleviation efforts

considering the significant fiscal expenditure that

it entails. The ongoing development of a social

registry information system to store information

related to welfare programmes is expected to

address the prevailing ambiguous exit and entry

procedures and to streamline the provision of these

benefits. The COVID-19 pandemic also highlighted

inequalities in terms of access to education. While

the rapid transition of educational activities to digital

platforms is appreciable, concerns have been

raised about the effectiveness of such initiatives,

especially among children from low income families

and those living in remote areas. Although mobile

penetration is high in Sri Lanka, computer literacy

stands at 32.0 per cent, and only 22.2 per cent of

households owned a desktop or laptop computer, as

per the Computer Literacy Survey for the first half

of 2020, highlighting that there are issues in terms

of access to online education. As the economy is

gradually returning to normalcy, such inequalities

related to income and education are likely to

create future inequalities relating to opportunity

and social mobility over the medium to long run.

In turn, the persistent effects of such inequalities

can have implications on generations, leading to

perpetuating inequality that will negatively affect

economic growth and socioeconomic wellbeing.

While the timeline of the pandemic remains

uncertain, other structural changes arising from

similar unforeseen events or even known ones,

such as digitalisation, unless properly planned,

can aggravate existing inequalities in the future.

Despite universal access to education and health,

which are essential predistributive policies, there is

a need to assess the quality, quantity and relevance

of these services in the context of the changing

nature of the economy. This will be pivotal to the

success of these services in breaking the cycle of

inequality. While the Government continues to focus

on the implementation of predistributive policies,

innovative mechanisms ought to be introduced

to improve the inclusivity, equity and resilience of

communities, without increasing the fiscal burden.

As a significant share of the labour force is engaged

in the informal sector, they remain outside the

ambit of any pension or superannuation scheme.

Considering the vulnerability of this segment of the

labour force, introduction of a nationwide contributory

pension scheme is essential to serve as a safety

mechanism, especially in view of the rapidly ageing

population. The lack of such a retirement scheme

for informal sector workers as well as inadequate

insurance coverage may lead to increased reliance

of vulnerable workers on the public safety net

mechanism in the future. Furthermore, allowing

public participation in welfare initiatives led by the

Government can help improve the coverage, and

potentially the quality of provisioning of essential

goods and services.

Increasing food self sufficiency in Sri Lanka

is crucial to address food security issues

and to ease external sector pressures, while

boosting economic growth through increased

agricultural production. Although Sri Lanka is

generally self sufficient in certain food categories,

1Food Security

Amongst the myriad economic and social concerns that intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, issues related to food security have garnered greater attention from policymakers, academics and the general public, locally as well as globally. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations, food security is the condition that exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meet their food preferences and dietary needs to live an active and healthy life. This definition covers four major dimensions of food security: availability, access, utilisation, and stability. Therefore, the concept of food security is broader than basic food production and ensuring availability of an adequate food supply. It encompasses numerous factors related to major dimensions of food security such as food production, distribution and storage, spatial availability of food, nutritional adequacy, economic and social accessibility, preferences, non-food aspects such as clean water, sanitation and other healthcare services, which improve food utilisation by individuals, as well as constancy of adequate food availability even during sudden shocks such as pandemics, wars or any seasonal, cyclical or other unexpected events. Food insecurity results in hunger in the short-run, but persistent food insecurity causes malnutrition issues, such as the prevalence of underweight, stunting, wasting and micronutrient deficiencies, and even death in acute cases. Unhealthy food choices compelled by food insecurity, carbohydrate rich diets for example, can lead to obesity and non-communicable diseases like diabetes and hypertension. Generally, children are mostly affected by chronic food insecurity, resulting in lower educational outcomes that will limit their economic opportunities in adulthood. Hence, ensuring food security is crucial for reducing hunger and poverty in Sri Lanka in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), thereby improving the general wellbeing of the population and productivity of the labour force, and reducing persistent health and malnutrition issues. Although Sri Lanka has made significant progress towards ensuring food security of the population in the past few decades, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened food insecurity at national and household levels.

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Status of Food Security

As per the FAO, 8.9 per cent of the world population, i.e., approximately 690 million people, were estimated to be undernourished prior to the pandemic. A preliminary estimation by the FAO indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic may add between 83 million to 132 million people to the total undernourished population in the world. Based on data prior to the

BOX 1Sri Lanka’s Food Security in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic

pandemic, Sri Lanka was ranked 66th among 113 countries in the Global Food Security Index (GFSI) -2019, which considers the dimensions of food availability, affordability, quality, and safety of foods. Meanwhile, child malnutrition has been a longstanding issue in Sri Lanka. According to the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)-2016 conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), stunting, wasting and underweight among children aged 5 years or below were 17.3 per cent, 15.1 per cent and 20.5 per cent, respectively. With unprecedented preventive measures, such as lockdowns and mobility restrictions taken globally and locally, economic activities of the country were disrupted, impacting supply chains and livelihoods of people, and thereby food security, despite the measures taken to ensure uninterrupted food production and distribution during the pandemic period. The experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic emphasise the importance of ensuring food security of the public during such unprecedented economic shocks, and the possibility of the aggravation of existing food insecurity issues in the country if such issues are not addressed appropriately.

Groups at Risk of Food Insecurity during the COVID-19 Pandemic

During the COVID-19 pandemic, risks to food security disproportionately aggravated for vulnerable groups of the population that were already facing food insecurity prior to its onset. The most vulnerable groups during the pandemic were individuals who have limited or irregular income, who have limited emergency reserves of food and savings, people with poor health, such as those with malnutrition issues and chronic diseases, those who are living in remote areas with less access to a variety of supplies and markets, certain groups of urban population who are entirely dependent on markets for their food needs, people who have limited social networks, people with limited or no transportation facilities, and other vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, homeless or displaced people and vulnerable children. Meanwhile, employment, either full or part-time, has been dampened by the pandemic-induced worker layoffs and the reduction in working hours in most affected sectors such as tourism, food and beverages, caregiving, and transport, thereby increasing the economic vulnerability of individuals engaged in these sectors.

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Food Systems

Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic transmit to food systems through both demand and supply sides. Although crop cultivation activities were not restricted in Sri Lanka, mobility restrictions resulted in a shortage

27

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

of manpower for labour-intensive crop cultivation and other food supply chain activities during the lockdown period. Accordingly, intermediary processes of food manufacturing, including processing, packaging, storage, and distribution, were impacted with labour shortages arising from the islandwide mobility restrictions imposed during the period from March to end April 2020, in particular. Meanwhile, post-harvest losses in perishable products increased notably during the lockdown due to disruptions to food distribution channels and closure of markets. Such supply side disruptions drove up food prices, adversely impacting vulnerable groups with less purchasing power, which prompted the Government to interfere through various measures to mitigate the situation. Nevertheless, as depicted in Figure B 1.1, food price inflation in Sri Lanka remained at elevated levels throughout 2020, making food less affordable for low income households and threatening their food security. Further, the disruption to international food trade due to the pandemic was a major concern for food security in many countries. In the wake of the pandemic, several countries restricted food exports to ensure stable domestic supplies. Such restrictions challenged the food security of net food importing countries during the pandemic, depending on the level of importance of imported food items in a country’s food consumption pattern.

On the demand side, loss of livelihoods of individuals due to the pandemic-induced economic downturn in the Sri Lankan economy could have limited individuals’ access to a healthy diet, particularly among the poor. With the emergence of the pandemic, demand for essential food items increased significantly due to panic buying and hoarding of food, thereby limiting access to essential food items for vulnerable groups of the population. Further, people’s opinion on the channels of disease spread also played a major role in determining demand for food during the pandemic, resulting in demand for meat products and fish, which are the major sources of protein, declining in 2020, especially during the second wave of the pandemic.

Policies Adopted to Ensure Food Security amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic

The Sri Lankan Government, with the support of several stakeholders of the economy, implemented numerous measures to address immediate supply and demand side issues related to the pandemic. Accordingly, the Government expanded the social protection programmes to protect people living in lockdown or isolated areas, vulnerable groups, and those who were employed in the most affected sectors in the economy by offering cash and in-kind grants. In addition, the Government continued its nutritional support programmes that target children, and pregnant and lactating mothers during the lockdown period by home delivery of foods. Meanwhile, the World Food Programme also attempted to minimise the disruptions to the school meal programme due to the closure of schools by providing take-home rations to homes of primary school children during July-August 2020. However, prolonged school closures remained a challenge for the continuation of the school meal programme. From a supply side perspective, it was imperative to facilitate emergency financing needs of all stakeholders in the food supply chain, with targeted measures such as the provision of concessional loans, debt moratoria, and business continuity loans, thereby supporting them to withstand the effects of the pandemic. Aligning with this goal, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka eased its monetary policy stance substantially by bringing interest rates to historically low levels in the market. Further, several concessional financing facilities were introduced, including interest subsidy schemes, refinance facilities as well as credit guarantee schemes, as a coordinated effort of both fiscal and monetary policy pillars to support businesses and individuals affected by the pandemic. However, alleviating liquidity constraints of producers and consumers may not be sufficient to ensure food security during a pandemic when intermediaries have greater market power. In such a situation, government procurement and public distribution, as well as stronger monitoring and regulation of markets are necessary to ensure better functioning of the food system and to avoid high food price inflation. Further, the Government’s policy agenda to encourage domestic agriculture, which re-introduced and promoted the concept of small family farming and urban farming, was supportive in fulfilling basic food needs of the population to a certain extent during the pandemic. The Government continued the fertiliser subsidy programme to support food production and offered fertiliser free of charge for paddy cultivation. In addition, health authorities took several measures to ensure strict adherence to health and safety regulations by the participants of food supply chain to prevent disease spread through food systems and ensure continuous functioning of food supply chains.

Way Forward

Although COVID-19 was an unprecedented event, it has underscored the significance of building resilience of the country’s food systems and households to cope

with such shocks and ensure food security of the population. Hence, food security issues of the country need to be addressed with a holistic policy approach with near to long-term strategies to ensure food security to withstand possible future shocks. While improving productivity levels in the agriculture sector, policy focus should also be on providing necessary inputs and water on time, improving marketing and distribution channels, especially through new technological avenues such as digital platforms and home delivery systems targeting needy groups, which will support food accessibility even during extreme events. Further, food production databases and public sector distribution channels should also be strengthened with institutional support from local government authorities in addition to national authorities to prevent consumer exploitation and malpractices by the private sector during a pandemic. Moreover, facilitating regional as well as cross country food trading is crucial to avoid risks to food security since Sri Lanka is import dependent on several major food commodities in the food balance sheet. Promotion of domestic production of these food items remains to be a necessary condition to ensure long-term food security in the country, while managing the short-term challenges when implementing conducive policies towards this end. Moreover, improving warehousing and storage facilities, including cold storage, enhancing packaging and transportation services are important in the medium to long-term to reduce post-harvest losses, prevent food

shortages and maintain food inflation at subdued levels. Meanwhile, wild animals such as elephants, monkeys, peacocks and wild boars create significant crop losses, which in turn threaten domestic food security, requiring a holistic and integrated approach to resolve human-wildlife conflict in an equitable and sustainable manner. Meanwhile, enabling income generation opportunities for economically vulnerable groups will enhance their resilience to cope with unanticipated shocks in the future. In addition, policies must be targeted at educating the public, particularly in relation to nutrition and food safety, to promote healthy eating habits and healthy eating choices amongst individuals. It is expected that these aspects will be taken into consideration when finalising the proposed National Agriculture Policy of the Government.

such as meat and eggs, it relies on imports for

major food categories, such as cereals, pulses,

milk and milk products, sugar, starchy crops,

and certain fruits and vegetables. Further, Sri

Lanka is compelled to import the country’s

staple food, rice, during the years of drought.

Accordingly, food and beverages imports account

for around 8 per cent of the total imports of the

country. Amidst the external sector imbalances

that worsened during the pandemic, increasing

domestic food production has become essential

to narrow the country’s trade deficit. Further, the

slow growth in the agriculture sector in recent

years has dampened the overall economic growth,

resulting in lower incomes for households who

are engaged in agricultural activities. Meanwhile,

logistical and supply side disruptions that

emerged with the pandemic, domestically as well

as globally, have impacted the food availability

and food choices while escalating food prices in

the market. Consequently, food security at the

household level has been threatened, especially

for the poorest and most vulnerable segments

of the economy. Thus, there is renewed interest

in increasing food self sufficiency of the country,

particularly in relation to food products that can

be produced domestically. With the drive towards

increasing food self sufficiency, the Government

has committed to providing free fertiliser for

paddy production and fertiliser subsidies for

several other major crops, while safeguarding

local agricultural producers by discouraging

imports of certain agricultural products. These are

welcome moves towards encouraging domestic

production and raising income levels of farmers.

Going forward, however, it may be necessary

to focus on promoting food self sufficiency by

augmenting agriculture sector productivity, since

over-reliance by farmers on subsidies will pose a

heavy burden on the Government budget. Further,

29

a heavily subsidised and protected agriculture

sector will lead to inefficient resource allocation

in the economy in the medium to long term, and

may even threaten household food security due

to inaccessibility of low cost and a wide range of

food products. Therefore, institutional support

needs to be provided to the farming community

to upscale production, and enhance technology

usage and productivity in agriculture activities.

In addition, developing markets for agricultural

products, reducing post harvest losses,

enhancing warehousing and storage facilities

and strengthening forward linkages in the value

chain, especially by promoting food industries,

are essential to encourage domestic agricultural

production and thereby increasing food self

sufficiency. Such policies will also ensure better

price realisation by farmers, which will enhance

their household income and re-investment

capacities. In addition, land market reforms are

also needed to support the productive use of

land and address the land fragmentation issue,

thereby promoting technology and machinery

usage in agricultural activities. Such reforms will

also support farmers in accessing credit through

the formal financial sector for investments in

agricultural production activities.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the

fragilities and vulnerabilities in Sri Lanka’s

labour force, emphasising the need for urgent

labour market reforms to pave way for the

creation of a resilient and dynamic labour force

that can contribute to the country’s transition

to a high income economy. There was a notable

disconnect between quarterly GDP and labour

market indicators during the year, highlighting the

presence of possible shortcomings in labour force

surveys and measurements, which is not unique to

Sri Lanka and has been observed worldwide during

the pandemic. The lack of suitable high frequency

indicators in Sri Lanka, in addition to limited quarterly

data, renders it difficult to carry out any real time

analysis of labour force trends during such volatile

periods. Although the economy is steadily returning

to normalcy, concepts of ‘physical distancing’ and the

stringent health regulations that are to be adhered to

will have some lingering effects on the economy. In

such situations, the most vulnerable people are low

wage workers in low income households, i.e., broadly

informal sector workers and lower occupational

categories among formal sector workers. Based on

the Annual Labour Force Survey for 2019, it was

estimated that over 57 per cent of those who were

employed were engaged in the informal sector and

of this, almost 61 per cent were engaged in the

non agricultural sector. A more detailed analysis

across occupational categories shows that the

most vulnerable occupations of services and sales

workers, workers in the agricultural sector, craft

workers, plant and machine operators, and those

engaged in elementary occupations comprise

around 88 per cent of informal sector employment

and 50 per cent of total employment. The unskilled

nature of workers in these sectors makes them

vulnerable not only during disruptions such as

COVID-19 but also in the wake of digitalisation

and automation in the future. In this regard, the

Government’s initiatives to provide permanent

employment opportunities to those with low levels

of educational attainment and those hailing from

low income households is commendable from a

social perspective, as it provides an opportunity for

such households to free themselves from the vicious

cycle of poverty. Despite the gradual transformation

of the economy and the simultaneous presence

of ‘Generation X’ and ‘Generation Y’ or ‘Millennial’

workers in the labour force, it is surprising that there

has been no evident shift in employment patterns

from the public to the private sector. This could

be a reconfirmation of the presence of a wedge

between ‘good jobs’ and ‘bad jobs’, stemming from

30

the unconditionally permanent nature of public

sector employment alongside pension benefits and

wages not being linked to performance. Further,

the lack of any performance driven criteria can

weigh negatively on the productivity of the growing

public sector, which could also have given rise to

underemployment and ‘hidden unemployment’.

A concerted effort is also required to upskill the

labour force, across all education levels, while

aligning them with the sectoral priorities of the

country. Discussions with various industries

reveal a broadbased shortage of skilled and semi-

skilled workers across all key sectors. This is to

be weighed against the persistently high levels

of youth unemployment, a large share of which

comprises those with an educational attainment

of G.C.E. Advanced Level (A/L) and above. There

is an urgent need for the education sector to work

with key public and private industry stakeholders

to identify the labour needs of the economy and

focus on upskilling and reskilling efforts. These

should also include the development of future

proof digital skills through a process of continued

work based learning. Further, for Sri Lanka’s

labour force to be able to make a productive

contribution to the economy’s progress while

reducing their vulnerabilities and assuring them

of dignified employment, a concerted effort needs

to be made in consultation with all stakeholders to

address longstanding issues, such as low levels of

female labour force participation and high levels

of informal employment in the economy, while

addressing the changing nature of employment

with the increasing numbers of ‘gig workers’. As

stated earlier, another required crucial reform in the

labour market is the introduction of a nationwide

contributory pension scheme, which could enhance

labour market flexibility while reducing future fiscal

burdens on social welfare. On the whole, labour

market reforms have to be undertaken with a multi-

sectoral approach that encompasses not only the

qualitative aspects of the labour force but also

legislative aspects that affect the flexibility of the

labour market, and in turn, the productive capacity

of the economy.

There is widespread recognition that

MSMEs are vital for the generation of inclusive

and sustainable growth, highlighting the need

to devise unique policy interventions to uplift

this segment. MSMEs play a key role in terms

of employment generation and smoothing out of

regional disparities. With the growing recognition of

the need for a domestic production economy, there

is a need to recognise the dearth of support for

MSMEs, which are the backbone of a sustainable

production economy. One of the key hindrances

faced by the sector is access to finance. On the

one hand, MSMEs struggle with issues such as

lack of collateral, poor project management and

financial planning, poor understanding of risks,

and overall lack of understanding about financing

opportunities available to them and to get support

from financial institutions. On the other hand,

despite the prevalence of several government

backed schemes for MSME funding, the financial

sector remains apprehensive about lending to

these enterprises. This is partially attributable to

the general dearth of expertise or knowledge in

development finance, which is essential for project

evaluation and feasibility assessment and is rather

different from conventional lending practices.

Accordingly, the formal financial sector is required

to consider the unique needs and constraints

faced by MSMEs and develop innovative banking

products and services specially focusing on

this sector. Although various credit guarantee

schemes have had some success in Sri Lanka, the

establishment of a well designed and well managed

Credit Guarantee Institution can play a pivotal

role in bridging this financing gap, as observed

in countries such as Chile and Malaysia. The

31

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

establishment of a National Development Banking

Corporation as proposed by the Government is also

timely. In addition to enhancing the ‘availability’ of

credit to MSMEs, there is also a need to focus on

improving their ‘bankability’ to improve access to

formal channels of finance and thereby ensuring

that they are profitable, productive, and sustainable

over the medium to long run. One other means of

addressing the issue of ‘bankability’ of MSMEs

is through technical awareness programmes

conducted by numerous public institutions and

other organisations that work with MSMEs. Such

programmes should focus on financial discipline,

financial reporting, and organisational and business

management. Improved access to finance and

financial literacy by MSMEs can have a positive

cyclical impact on their performance and progress,

which in turn will enable them to adopt newer

technologies, increase productivity, improve quality,

and enhance their profitability and sustainability.

The recently launched National Financial Inclusion

Strategy (NFIS) and also the efforts to develop

domestic value chains are expected to strengthen

the contribution of MSMEs towards inclusive and

sustained growth and development.

The financial sector of Sri Lanka needs to

evolve fast to cater to the emerging needs of

the economy in the prevailing low inflation,

low interest rate environment. On the one hand,

a low interest rate structure poses significant

challenges for economically vulnerable groups,

particularly senior citizens, due to low returns

on their deposits. On the other hand, lending

rates must remain low to encourage investment

spending. However, financial institutions often find

it challenging to fund emerging demand for large

scale investment and business ventures due to

the lack of balance sheet strength. Meanwhile,

the absence of financial institutions specialising

in financing large scale development projects

has also restricted the funding avenues for large

scale investors. These drawbacks and challenges

highlight the importance and the need for financial

sector development in Sri Lanka, particularly in the

context where the Government is attempting to

promote domestically funded investment in large

scale projects. To address concerns with respect

to low deposit rates, financial institutions should

focus on introducing alternative, novel, safe, and

attractive financial products, particularly for savers

who are adversely affected by low returns. Rising

cost to the Government in continuing the additional

interest offered for deposits of senior citizens also

highlights the importance of introducing alternative

financial products. Moreover, measures should

be taken to enhance financial literacy and public

awareness on the merits of usually unsought

and under-advertised financial products, such as

life insurance, annuities, unit trusts, repurchase

agreements, and equity. Further, the public should

be made increasingly aware of value added services,

such as wealth management and other financial

advisory services, offered by financial institutions

at present. Such alternatives would provide the

community of savers, including the elderly, with a

range of financial products and services that would

yield better returns. With respect to enhancing the

lending capacities of financial institutions in the

context of envisaged high economic growth and

the low interest rate environment, the possibilities

of financial sector consolidation should be actively

pursued. Such consolidation would enhance the

resilience of the domestic financial sector, while

also addressing the existing weaknesses in the

sector through the creation of a large capital

base, enhancing its potential to finance large

scale transactions and attract foreign investment,

widening the range of financial services, and

thereby improving the efficiency and profitability of

the overall financial sector in the economy. Most

importantly, stronger balance sheets of financial

32

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2020

1

institutions would enable improved credit flows to

needy and productive sectors, while increasing

capacity to service the growing financing needs of

the economy.

As the country’s interest rate structure is

expected to remain in single digit levels, the

general public needs to be more vigilant of

offers and opportunities promoted by various

unscrupulous parties. With interest rates on

savings reducing to significantly low levels, some

social groups, who have been adversely affected

by low returns on savings, are attracted to risky

alternatives that are said to yield better returns.

The resurgence of illegal deposit mobilising

entities generally gathers pace in a low interest

rate environment. Such entities attempt to lure

unsuspecting depositors by promising extremely

attractive returns despite frequent warnings by the

Central Bank on risks involved. Moreover, pyramid

schemes, which are prohibited in Sri Lanka, tend to

operate in the form of multi level marketing (MLM)

or network marketing opportunities that promise

extraordinary returns for referrals. As investment

in such programmes entails a high degree of risk,

the public needs to be vigilant of such prohibited

schemes and illegal entities. The public should

take all necessary precautions, and conduct due

diligence on alternative investment opportunities,

while refraining from investing in prohibited

schemes. The public could also direct their queries

and concerns to the Financial Consumer Relations

Department of the Central Bank and seek

assistance to avoid the pitfall of being scammed

by illegal, ‘too good to be true’ financial schemes.

Although the usage of digital payment

methods accelerated with the unexpected

circumstances created by the pandemic, fast

evolving technology demands preparedness

of stakeholders in the financial sector and

improved financial literacy among the general

public to make use of the technology. The

pandemic created opportunities for the financial

sector to attract more people towards digital

payment systems. Digitalising payment systems

provides various financial as well as non financial

benefits to the customer, the merchant and the

financial institution. Although the initial capital

investment in the payment digitalisation process is

relatively high, transaction and administration costs

are notably low along with increased speed and

improved transparency, compared to cash or paper

based transactions. As mobile phone penetration

has increased notably over the past few years,

promoting digital payments would aid in improving

financial inclusion in the country by a broad based

attraction of the public to the formal financial

system, thereby enhancing prospects of inclusive

growth. With rapid technological developments

globally, new methods of payments evolve via

social media platforms, open banking models, etc.

In this regard, the adoption of blockchain technology

into the banking system and the introduction of

virtual currencies into the monetary system have

been deliberated extensively. The outbreak of the

COVID-19 pandemic provided the opportunity

to progress on this front. Although Sri Lanka

has recorded a notable progress in digitalising

payment systems with the introduction of mobile

payments apps, Quick Response (QR) code related

transactions, Point of Sale (POS) transactions as

well as e-commerce, a majority of retail transactions

takes place through cash or paper based methods

in the economy. Against this backdrop, the financial

sector needs to further capitalise on Sri Lanka’s

wider penetration of mobile phones in order to attract

the masses towards digital payment systems. While

the younger generation adapts fast to innovative

payment methods, a larger share of the population

remains outside these systems due to factors such

as lack of self-confidence and safety concerns.

33

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

Hence, further measures are needed to popularise

the usage of digital payments in the country in

order to reap maximum benefits of technological

developments to enhance efficiency in the financial

system and increase financial inclusion.

Environmental issues in Sri Lanka

increasingly exert considerable macroeconomic

implications, underscoring the importance of

a sustainable development policy framework.

Environmental issues that have repeatedly

surfaced over the past several years, such as

climate change, depletion of forest cover, land

degradation, solid waste disposal including non-

degradable and e-waste, threats to wildlife, coastal

erosion, air pollution, and pollution of water bodies,

generally receive less attention, as environmental

conservation and economic growth are often seen

as conflicting objectives. However, recurrent natural

disasters and climate change have increased the

vulnerability of the Sri Lankan economy in the recent

past, affecting domestic production and economic

activity, BOP as well as energy security. The

Global Climate Risk Index (GCRI) that estimates

countries’ vulnerability to extreme weather events

in terms of direct consequences, i.e., deaths and

economic losses, has ranked Sri Lanka among the

top ten countries that are most affected by climate

change in three consecutive years from 2016 to

2018. Vulnerability of Sri Lanka to climate change

induced frequent and extreme natural disasters

poses a major threat to the agricultural sector.

Hence, these climate related risks have a direct

effect on agricultural productivity and threaten food

security and increase inequalities. Meanwhile,

energy security of Sri Lanka is highly compromised

during dry weather conditions, and the country

faces significant external pressure during drought

periods since hydropower generation has to

be substituted with high cost and environment

unfriendly thermal power generation. Further,

climate challenges can also disrupt the economy by

diverting resources, especially from technology and

innovation to reconstruction and replacement, while

restricting funds available for other development

projects. Therefore, a proactive and holistic disaster

management and a sustainable development

framework is essential to mitigate the adverse

impact of climate change. Several measures

have already been adopted to address emerging

negative consequences of disasters, and these

need to be strengthened within a framework with

emphasis on policy reforms on disaster prevention,

preparedness, response and recovery measures

with a view to reducing the climate vulnerability of

the economy while increasing the resilience of the

entire community against climate risks. Moreover,

special attention on comprehensive environmental

impact assessments of development projects,

development and promotion of environment related

market instruments, such as polluter-payment

systems, environmental taxes and green financial

instruments, public awareness and involvement

in environmental conservation, enforcement

of regulations, and monitoring system with

institutional support are essential to enhance the

country’s disaster management profile and drive

the economy on a sustainable growth path.

Accurate and timely data play a key role in

information based societies. While high quality

data enable policymakers and stakeholders of

the economy to evaluate alternatives and make

informed decisions, poor and delayed data lead to

the formation of misjudged public opinion as well as

policy errors, incurring economic and social costs,

thereby impacting economic progress and stability.

Mitigating such implications relies on accurate

and adequate coverage of samples, vigilant

processing of data, and prompt dissemination. This

requires increased transparency and adherence

to internationally accepted data compilation

34

methodologies and standards. Traditional

data collection and compilation methods were

challenged amidst the pandemic due to lockdown,

mobility restrictions and inadequate tools and

technical know-how to capture data through non-

traditional methods. One key concern associated

with the existing compilation methods of measuring

GDP during the pandemic is about capturing data

on new economic activities that emerged, such as

work from home, and informal service provision

using online platforms. Traditional structured

approaches to obtain data in predefined frequencies

will be insufficient to estimate the performance of

a particular sector that adapts fast to changing

circumstances. Therefore, it is vital to build the

capacity of state agencies that are responsible for

data collection and dissemination and empower

relevant personnel with knowledge, expertise and

technology required to overcome such challenges.

Countries across the globe tend to use high

frequency online surveys on indicators of economic

activity. This became vital during the pandemic as

delays in disseminating economic statistics and

releasing highly provisional estimates at predefined

deadlines and subsequent large revisions resulted

in inaccurate signals to the market. Development

of effective data management processes could

be considered a central part of policy formulation

assisted by proper sourcing, management, and

analysis of data for the use of stakeholders of the

economy. The use of decision supporting tools,

such as artificial intelligence and automation,

largely depends on timeliness and accuracy of data.

This reiterates the need for high quality and timely

data, and the use of novel technologies for data

collection as well as for data dissemination, thereby

facilitating prompt and accurate decision making

and informed opinion formation by stakeholders of

the economy.

The preceding non-exhaustive discussion

highlights the necessity, urgency and

complexity of required policy adjustments

to ensure the country’s progression along a

high, sustainable and equitable growth path

while enhancing macroeconomic stability.

In 2020, amidst headwinds from multiple fronts,

the Sri Lankan economy once again showed its

resilience, supported by swift policy responses

from the Government and the Central Bank. The

COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the establishment

of a Government with a strong mandate endorsed

by a large majority of people, also provided

an opportunity to reset policies to address

longstanding vulnerabilities of the economy. As

the economy carefully treads through rough

terrain in the near term as it did in 2020, the

implementation of the macroeconomic framework

envisioned by the Government, including much

needed reforms to enhance overall productivity

and efficiency of the economy with the support of

the private sector, is expected to strengthen the

economic outlook for the medium term, thereby

enabling the achievement of the Government's

goals of prosperity and splendour for the country

as a whole as well as the different segments of its

people.
