    "text": "Workers\u2019 remittances have been the largest single source of foreign exchange inflow in Sri Lanka\u2019s balance of payments (BOP) over the past decade. Contrary to the global expectation of a possible slowdown in workers\u2019 remittances in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, Sri Lanka and a few other countries in South Asia stood out as exceptions, recording healthy remittance flows in 2020, demonstrating a sharp recovery from a dip recorded during the first half of the year. In this backdrop, it is imperative to recognise the importance of workers\u2019 remittances as a non-debt creating external financing source and the socio-economic challenges related to labour migration that need to be resolved in enhancing remittances to be a sustainable foreign exchange inflow to the country. Accordingly, this article discusses the historical trends and economic benefits of workers\u2019 remittances as well as social considerations related to labour migration while highlighting the challenges in enhancing remittances and measures to improve remittances.",

    "text": "Workers\u2019 remittances have long been a cushion against the current account shortfall, which emanated from the deficits in the trade and primary income accounts. Workers\u2019 remittances constitute almost 100 per cent of the inflows to the secondary income account of the external current account. Over the past two decades, annual remittances have represented nearly one fourth of the total credits to the external current account, on average, and exceptionally, this share exceeded more than one third (35 per cent) in 2020, reiterating the significance of remittances in mitigating external sector vulnerabilities and in maintaining macroeconomic stability. Being a major source of financing the trade deficit, workers\u2019 remittances have covered around 80 per cent of the annual trade deficit on average over the past two decades and remittance inflow has exceeded the trade deficit in 2020 accounting for around 118 per cent of the trade deficit. In 2020, the increase in workers\u2019 remittances helped abate the impact of the sharp decline in tourist earnings.",

Nevertheless, remittances have shown a declining trend during the past six years, except for 2016 and 2020. In the second half of 2020, workers\u2019 remittances increased significantly and recorded the highest monthly remittances in the history in December 2020. Accordingly, during 2020, workers\u2019 remittances increased by 5.8 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 7.1 billion.

The foremost cost of labour migration is the social cost emanating from the impact on the wellbeing of the family members, especially the children who are left behind in the country. Most of the time, the health, nutrition and security of children are compromised in the families of migrant employees, especially with maternal migration. Moreover, lack of financial literacy of some migrant workers as well as their family members often leads to poor management of remittances for productive purposes making it difficult to attain the expected improvement in the standard of living of their households. In some households, remittances are spent on consumption of alcohol or drugs by the family members rather than on education of the children or for investment purposes. These issues are more prominent in the families of women who migrate for housemaid jobs.",

    "text": "Apart from social issues, several other factors act as impediments to improving the earning capacity of migrant employees and thus affecting remittances. In terms of the skills profile of migrant employees, Sri Lanka is heavily dependent on housemaids. However, the housemaids category, which accounted for the largest share of annual migrations of over 50 per cent two decades ago, has declined drastically to a share of below 30 per cent by 2020. In contrast, the share of labour migration under professional and skilled employee categories combined has almost doubled from 21 per cent to 37 per cent during the same period. Even though an upward trend in skilled labour migration can be witnessed, there exists a large mismatch between",

A higher demand is generated in advanced economies for specialised services such as nursing and elderly care with the changes in demographics including population ageing and increased female labour force participation rates. These jobs have a relatively high earning potential than in the case of housemaids. However, Sri Lanka has limited training institutions with international accreditation, recognised by foreign employers, to provide job-oriented training to bridge the skills gap and increase the readiness of Sri Lankan migrant employees to international markets.",

    "text": "Despite being a relatively stable source of foreign exchange, workers\u2019 remittances to Sri Lanka are highly vulnerable to economic and political volatilities in source countries due to over reliance on the Middle Eastern region as a destination for labour migration. The Middle Eastern region remains the primary market for Sri Lankan migrant workers, accounting for 80-90 per cent of annual departures for foreign employment from the country and more than half of the total remittance receipts. As such, the declining trend in remittances observed since 2015 may be partly attributed to the fall in the income of oil exporting countries in the Middle East. Unavailability of social security programmes for migrant employees also discourages employees from searching for employment opportunities abroad. Moreover, COVID-19 has also adversely impacted migrant workers as some employers have terminated employment of migrant workers during the first round of the pandemic. These workers faced many hardships due to COVID-19 related travel restrictions. Sri Lanka currently does not operate any contributory job loss insurance scheme for migrants that would ensure a minimum income to migrant workers even if they lose employment due to various factors, including a pandemic or a retirement benefit scheme that would ensure a continuous income stream for these workers in the latter stages of their lives.",

Further, the Government, in consultation with the Monetary Board of the Central Bank, introduced a Special Deposit Account scheme to attract more inward remittances to the country in 2020. The Government together with the cooperation of other relevant stakeholders has established a Task Force to propose recommendations aiming at improving remittances.",

In this regard, exploring new labour markets and entering into bilateral agreements with other advanced economies, including Singapore, Japan and European countries are imperative to reduce the exposure of Sri Lankan foreign remittances being sourced largely from one single region. Progressive up-skilling of migrant workers through investments in competency development through vocational training and by providing high quality training on par with international standards, is beneficial in securing employment opportunities with higher and stable earnings. In addition, attention should also be drawn to improving the language proficiency, financial literacy and cultural preparation of migrant employees at the pre-departure training programmes.

Hence, there is a pressing need to improve the data collection systems on remittances. In this regard, the Central Bank is in the process of implementing an International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS), which is a comprehensive cross border and foreign currency transactions monitoring system that will be executed through licensed banks. This will help improve BOP statistics including but not limited to a wide range of data on workers\u2019 remittances while also supporting to reconcile any statistical discrepancies. The ITRS will provide disaggregated workers\u2019 remittances data based on the country of origin, currency, remittance receiving districts, demographics of remitters and recipient banks which will enable to better estimate the distribution of remittances and identify emerging trends that would be of use in devising policies to enhance remittances.",
