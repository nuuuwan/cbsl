    "text": "The involvement of foreign investors has been notable in Sri Lanka\u2019s mega scale development projects related to infrastructure and private sector ventures, particularly in the last decade. However, given the persistent gap between savings and required investment, difficulties in attracting enough foreign investments remain a major bottleneck that has slowed down Sri Lanka\u2019s journey towards development. Such difficulties have had a multifaceted impact on growth, employment and income distribution. In the current context, the unforeseeable future bundled with the global pandemic has escalated the spectrum of challenges for Sri Lanka to address, including the need to reduce overdependency on debt creating foreign inflows, in order to sustain medium to long run economic growth and stability. Against this backdrop, the country has redoubled its efforts to attract foreign direct investments (FDIs) as a key source of non-debt creating inflows. In doing so, it is crucial to improve the investment landscape, which could be done by focussing on improving Sri Lanka\u2019s global rankings (Table B 2.1), thereby enhancing the country\u2019s viability as a preferred destination for investors based on different aspects of socio-economic conditions.",

Sri Lanka was ranked at the 118th position in terms of the labour market in the Global Competitiveness Index. This was driven by low scores on the ease of hiring foreign labour, internal labour mobility and redundancy costs. Investors face difficulties in terminating existing contracts under the prevailing labour laws. Further, labour mobility within the country is limited, thereby creating a lacuna in labour supply. While the protection of the workforce is essential, it must be understood that creating employment through attracting foreign investments and enhancing domestic investments is equally important. Ongoing government programmes for early identification of talent and promoting multiple vocational training programmes are expected to bear fruit in future, particularly as the country prepares for a high economic growth path. Labour market reforms will also support accruing benefits to the country with the establishment of the Colombo Port City and related development projects.",

Tax system of Sri Lanka was recently updated with a more simplified structure and the Government is keen on maintaining the current tax policy for the medium term to support the businesses. Modernisation of return submission and other services with the use of technology will help simplifying the tax systems and in turn will motivate the taxpayers to honour the tax obligations without evading. Further, the ongoing efforts to increase the use of technology in paying taxes, which was enabled through the Revenue Administration Management Information System (RAMIS), will also be beneficial.

    "text": "In terms of enforcing legal contracts, Sri Lanka was ranked at the 164th position in the Ease of Doing Business Index with an average time of 1,318 days for resolving a legal matter. Steps have been taken in the recent past to use technology for expediting the judicial processes. Preliminary work is underway to introduce e-courts and expedite the longstanding cases within a strict time frame. However, there is still a considerable progress required to improve legal processes. Releasing lands for various projects is also a tedious task for investors, due to rigidities in the land registration process and outdated laws related to land ownership. Therefore, the legal system needs to be restructured to facilitate investment. Establishment of an arbitration centre and additional Commercial Courts to resolve urgent business and investor cases would also be beneficial in improving the overall efficiency of the legal system.",

A good road network and other modern commuter transport solutions, state-of-the-art seaports and airports and the provision of utilities without delays and interruptions are crucial to attract investment. During the past decade, Sri Lanka has accelerated improving the infrastructure network, hence positioning itself at the 61st place in the Global Competitiveness Index in terms of infrastructure. However, still there are concerns regarding road connectivity, efficiency of transport services and access to utilities. Addressing these concerns will contribute to attracting potential investors.",

However, such positive responses have not resulted in sufficient investment inflows due to the weaknesses discussed above. The Government has already initiated a programme to improve the country\u2019s ease of doing business conditions, which will complement enhancing Sri Lanka\u2019s position in global rankings. Provision of \u2018One-Stop Shop\u2019 facilities for investors would support the Government\u2019s endeavours to entice investors. Meanwhile, the establishment of the Colombo Port City Commission is expected to provide a doing business environment that is in par with investment hotspots around the world, thereby raising the prospects to enhance the FDI inflows to new heights. While overcoming the complex challenges associated with the COVID-19 Pandemic, efforts must continue to address the identified weaknesses with a focussed approach, to establish the necessary steppingstones required for sustainable relationships with strategic investment partners.",
