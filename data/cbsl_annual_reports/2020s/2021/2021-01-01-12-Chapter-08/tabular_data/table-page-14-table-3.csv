and  advances  to  licensed  banks  based  on  acceptable

were issued temporarily restricting discretionary payments 
of licensed banks to ensure maintenance of appropriate

by  banks.  Further,  licensed  banks  were  also  required

the  requirements  to  adhere  to  health  guidelines  and  to

of which would, in return accrue to the banking sector to 
remain resilient.
To ease the pressure on the exchange rate and the stress 
on  financial  markets  due  to  the  impact  of  COVID-19 
outbreak,  the  Central  Bank  issued  Directions  extending 
the  maximum  period  for  the  settlement  of  export  credit 
facilities  out  of  export  proceeds  to  180  days  from  the 
date  of  shipment,  and  measures  to  curtail  certain  non-
essential  imports  and  foreign  currency  investments  by 
respective banks.
The Central Bank took various steps to keep the general 
public 
informed  of 
amidst the COVID-19 outbreak by issuing press releases, 
having a dedicated webpage in the Central Bank website 
providing information on COVID-19 relief measures and 
conducting  virtual  educational  seminars  for  the  public. 
Further,  the  Central  Bank  also  developed  a  pictorial 
and  digitally,  which  was  displayed  in  the  Central  Bank 
website and social media and was also circulated among 
licensed  banks.  This  poster  drew  the  attention  of  the 
general public to be vigilant with respect to scams.
Supervisory Measures Adopted in Relation to 
On-site and Off-site Supervision
Following the initial COVID-19 outbreak, the timelines for 
addressing supervisory concerns by licensed banks were 
re-set by granting extended time periods for addressing 
supervisory  concerns  which  were  to  be  addressed  up 
to  31  May  2020  depending  on  the  severity.  Further, 
the deadline for submission of statutory returns to Bank 
Supervision  Department  was  extended  by  two  weeks, 
and the publication of quarterly financial statements was 
extended by one month.
During  the  lockdown  period,  on-site  examinations  of 
licensed banks were temporarily halted and examinations 
of licensed banks were conducted on a remote basis based","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
