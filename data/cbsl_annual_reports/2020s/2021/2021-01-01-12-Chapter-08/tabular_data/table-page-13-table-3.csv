Therefore, regulators have facilitated banks to provide

restructured  in  ways  that  may  be  beneficial  for  both 
banks and borrowers, to avoid placing borrowers with 
immediate cash flow constraints in the ‘default’ category

been utilised by regulators to allow banks to absorb losses 
arising from the COVID-19 outbreak without breaching

create space for credit growth and facilitate key banking 
services to the real economy. Further, relaxations have 
also  been  provided  by  reducing  liquidity  buffers,  viz. 
Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding
