8.1 OverviewD

uring the year 2020, the stability of Sri Lanka’s financial system was preserved amidst challenging

domestic and global market conditions posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the challenging

economic environment resulting from the pandemic, and regional or countrywide lockdown periods

disrupting business activities to a larger extent, the banking sector exhibited moderate growth in terms of

loans and advances, investments, and deposit base. However, deterioration in credit quality, sovereign

rating downgrades and decreased foreign inflows due to the pandemic, exerted pressure on the banking

sector operations. Having identified the importance of reviving adversely affected sectors in the economy,

the Central Bank implemented several extraordinary regulatory measures to provide flexibility to Licensed

Commercial Banks (LCBs) and Licensed Specialised Banks (LSBs) in supporting businesses and individuals

affected by the pandemic. The Licensed Finance Companies (LFCs) and Specialised Leasing Companies

(SLCs) sector recorded sluggish performance as reflected by the decline in asset base, loans and advances

and deposits as well as increasing Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) and declining profitability during the year,

mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic related growth impediments and the lack of public confidence in

some weak LFCs. The Central Bank initiated several regulatory actions along with the introduction of the

Financial Sector Consolidation Master Plan to avoid further deterioration of the financial position of LFCs,

maintain the stability of the sector and safeguard the interest of depositors. Other sectors in the financial

system recorded a mixed performance. Meanwhile, the Central Bank ensured the availability of liquidity

in the money market, particularly considering the need for supporting the financial system and facilitating

economic activities during the COVID-19 pandemic period by introducing several monetary policy relaxation

measures in 2020. Though the pressure on the exchange rate observed in March - April eased thereafter,

with the imposition of restrictions on non- essential imports and selected outward remittances, improved

workers’ remittances and the rebound of export earnings, the pressure re-emerged due to relatively low level

of Foreign Exchange (FX) inflows together with the gradual relaxations of restrictions and FX repatriations.

This situation was further aggravated by the consecutive sovereign rating downgrades by global rating

agencies. However, owing to the modest FX interventions and several policy measures taken by the Central

Bank, the exchange rate stood at around Rs. 185 by end 2020. The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE)

recovered from the significant decline it witnessed with the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, to a record

high in terms of overall price index. Domestic investors’ preference shifting towards equity investments

in a low interest rate regime helped market recovery although foreign outflows continued. Meanwhile, the

Central Bank continued to ensure uninterrupted payment and settlement services in the country amidst the

COVID-19 pandemic.

8.2 Performance of the Banking Sector

Despite enduring challenges stemming from

the COVID-19 pandemic, the banking sector

remained resilient mainly due to the capital and

liquidity buffers built over the past few years,

and continued to expand at a notable pace

during 2020 compared to 2019. Additionally, to

alleviate the impact of the pandemic, the Central

Bank implemented a number of extraordinary

regulatory measures to provide flexibility to licensed

banks in supporting businesses and individuals

affected by the pandemic.

The banking sector dominated the financial

sector accounting for 72.5 per cent of total

assets as at end 2020. Despite the challenging

economic environment resulting from the on-going

pandemic and regional or countrywide lock-down

periods disrupting business activities to a greater

extent, credit growth of the banking sector improved

during 2020 compared to 2019. Deposits were

the dominant source of funding, while there was

a notable decline in foreign currency borrowings

during 2020 due to decreased FX inflows as a result

of the pandemic and sovereign rating downgrades.

The banking sector profits improved compared

to the previous year due to notable increase in

non-interest income as a result of movements in

the interest rates and exchange rates, decrease in

non-interest expenses and reduction of taxes.

Business Expansion: By end 2020, the

banking sector comprised 30 banks, i.e., 24

LCBs including 11 branches of foreign banks,

and 6 LSBs. Upon completion of the closure

procedures which commenced in 2019, based

on decisions taken by their Head Offices, the

banking licences issued to ICICI Bank Limited and

Axis Bank Limited to operate in Sri Lanka were

cancelled during the year 2020. The banking sector

continued to support economic growth and promote

financial inclusion by enhancing banking services

and expanding the banking network. In 2020, with

the restrictions on physically accessing banks

due to curfew and lockdowns imposed to prevent

the spread of COVID-19, most banks introduced

technology-based products/services to facilitate

financial inclusion.

Assets: The banking sector asset base

increased by Rs. 2.1 trillion during the year

surpassing Rs. 14.6 trillion by end December

2020, recording a year-on-year growth of

17.1 per cent compared to that of 6.2 per cent

reported as at end 2019. Despite the challenging

economic and business environment due to the

on-going pandemic, growth in investments and

credit contributed to the assets growth. Growth in

loans and advances improved from 5.6 per cent

in 2019 to 11.9 per cent in 2020. Approximately,

83 per cent of the increase in the loan portfolio

during 2020 was attributed to the increase in rupee

loans. Increase in credit was diversified across the

major sectors of the economy. In terms of products,

re-scheduled loans (38.0 per cent), housing loans

(18.0 per cent) and term loans (14.1 per cent) were

the main products which reported higher growth

rates during 2020. Meanwhile, the year-on-year

growth in investments exceeded that of credit

during the year, increasing from 12.2 per cent

as at end 2019 to 40.0 per cent as at end 2020.

The Held to Maturity (HTM) portfolio grew by 41.8

per cent during 2020 due to Treasury Bonds and

Treasury Bills increasing by Rs. 804.7 billion and

Rs. 55.9 billion, respectively, while investments in

Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) decreased

by Rs. 73.3 billion. The trading portfolio grew

by 32.4 per cent, with investments in Treasury

bills, Treasury bonds and SLDBs increasing by

Rs. 78.8 billion, Rs. 68.3 billion and Rs. 35.5 billion,

respectively.

Liabilities: Deposits continued to be the

main source of funding followed by borrowings.

Term deposits accounted for 47.0 per cent of

the increase in deposits during the year despite

a decrease in its share in total deposits from

66.5 per cent as at end 2019 to 63.0 per cent as at

end 2020. Meanwhile, savings and current deposits

accounted for 28.3 per cent and 6.2 per cent,

Introduction

Sustainable Finance can be broadly defined as financial services integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria into the decision-making process and business activities of firms, aiming at long lasting benefits for the firm, its clients and the society at large. However, there is no single, agreed global definition on what constitutes Sustainable Finance.

Green Finance is a component of Sustainable Financing. Green Finance, in general, refers to the channelling of financial flows towards meeting the challenges of climate change and the transition into a low-carbon economy. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines Green Finance as finance for achieving economic growth while reducing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, minimising waste and improving efficiency in the use of natural resources.

Today, as a consequence of population growth, environmental degradation, climate change, poverty and inequality, Sustainable Finance practices are fast becoming the future in banking. The United Nations (UN) also recognised the importance of sustainable development and introduced the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to address such challenges and call for action by all countries to promote prosperity while protecting the planet.

Sustainable Finance Journey and Roadmap of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

The importance of initiating Sustainable Finance in Sri Lanka has been widely discussed among the stakeholders of the financial sector. In 2016, the Central Bank joined the International Finance Corporation (IFC) supported Sustainable Banking Network (SBN), which represents 86 per cent of banking assets in emerging markets.

In 2017, the Central Bank initiated the process of developing a Roadmap for Sustainable Finance in Sri Lanka to facilitate and promote sustainable finance practices in consultation with relevant government agencies, the banking industry and a wide range of financial sector stakeholders. The Central Bank also appointed a steering committee to facilitate developing the Sustainable Finance Roadmap for the financial sector in Sri Lanka through an inclusive multi-stakeholder process.

The Roadmap for Sustainable Finance was launched in June 2019 with the financial assistance of the Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN) of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) along with technical assistance of the IFC. The Roadmap was developed in consultation with stakeholders including the Sri Lanka Banks’ Association (Guarantee) Ltd. (SLBA), the Finance Houses Association of Sri Lanka, the

BOX 7A New Era in Banking : Green and Beyond

Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka.

This Roadmap provides a broader direction to financial regulators and financial institutions to effectively manage ESG risks associated with projects they finance, and promote assistance to businesses that are greener, climate-friendly and socially inclusive. It attempts to scale up the contribution of the financial sector, including banking and finance, capital markets and insurance industry, and help build a more resilient and sustainable green economy.

The SLBA launched the Sustainable Banking Initiative (SL-SBI) in July 2015. Its purpose is to provide a platform to enhance understanding and action on responsible banking practices that can facilitate sustainable economic growth in Sri Lanka. Since its inception, the SL-SBI has successfully crafted and launched a set of 11 Sustainable Banking Principles. These principles, developed by a committee of participating banks, define how the Sri Lankan banking sector can conduct business to facilitate more sustainable economic growth locally.

Each country has adopted a unique route to promote Sustainable Finance in response to its local context and priorities. In countries such as Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Morocco, Nigeria and Vietnam, regulators have taken the lead through policy-based initiatives. On the contrary, in countries such as Colombia, Ecuador, Kenya, Mexico, Mongolia, South Africa and Turkey, banking associations have coordinated voluntary, industry-led initiatives. Sri Lanka is in a unique position with the SLBA launching the SL-SBI, the Central Bank collaborating with stakeholders, and launching the Roadmap where both approaches have been harmonised.

Most of the large licensed banks in Sri Lanka have already set up Sustainable Finance banking units and have launched sustainability initiatives focusing on areas such as renewable energy, entrepreneur development, environment protection and women empowerment. Many Sri Lankan licensed banks have been reporting on ‘Sustainability’ in their Annual Reports for over a decade using the guidelines published by the Global Reporting Initiative. Further, SLBA led initiatives and the Centre for Banking Studies have conducted many programmes to enhance the awareness and capacity on Sustainable Finance within the banking industry, and the SL-SBI also launched an e-Learning platform to facilitate capacity building on Sustainable Finance.

Banking Regulation and Sustainable Finance

The Central Bank is currently in the process of implementing the Action Plan as set out in the Roadmap to achieve targeted actions with the support of relevant stakeholders.

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2020

1948

A key issue identified by many of the Green and Sustainable Finance initiatives is the need to develop standard definitions, a taxonomy of what constitutes Sustainable Finance, comparable metrics, and methodology for measuring the impact of Sustainable Finance. A sustainable taxonomy is a classification system, establishing a list of environmentally and socially sustainable economic activities.

In operationalising the actions of the Roadmap, the Central Bank has recognised the need for devising an applicable taxonomy, which is a key requirement in facilitating the financial sector towards sustainable finance. Currently, the Central Bank is in the process of developing a taxonomy for the financial sector of Sri Lanka to serve as a classification system that enables categorisation of economic activities/sectors that play key roles in climate change mitigation and adaptation in the Sri Lankan context.

The Regulatory Toolkit available for regulators on Sustainable Finance includes tools such as:

• Introduction of ceilings on credit extension to

certain carbon intensive or polluting activities

• Green Finance Guidelines and Frameworks

• Climate-related stress testing

• Disclosure requirements on climate related and

green financing risks

• Directed Green Credit Policy Instruments, and

• Green Differentiated Reserve Requirements.

Sri Lanka intends to initiate suitable instruments for the purpose of promoting Sustainable Finance, in line with the Roadmap of the Central Bank, considering market developments and needs. Sustainable Finance tools such as Green Finance Guidelines and Frameworks will be considered for implementation in the future after giving due supervisory considerations.

Regulators around the globe have thus far not explicitly taken into account the green or brown nature of the underlying assets when computing their perceived riskiness. Some central banks and supervisors have further integrated climate-related risks into the supervisory framework by adjusting and communicating their supervisory expectations.

Going forward, banks could also look at the feasibility of incorporating scenarios that estimate the potential impact on financial stability from supplying credit to environmentally unsustainable or sustainable activities over time into the banks’ Pillar 2 Supervisory Review stress tests under the Basel Capital Framework.

Challenges

Currently, no uniform Sustainable Finance taxonomy has been implemented globally. This has led to ESG factors considered in the assessment of Sustainable Finance being inconsistent and incomparable.

Lack of expertise and capacity will be a barrier faced by all stakeholders including the regulators. Especially new green products and technologies will evolve dynamically, and expertise and experience will be required to assess viability. Therefore, capacity building efforts and technical guidance are paramount for the successful implementation of the Sustainable Finance initiative.

Information asymmetry on Sustainable Finance from both loan origination and risk management may hinder Sustainable Finance initiatives. Therefore, information systems and information flows must be improved to cater to evolving Sustainable Finance needs.

In the future, financial institutions will be expected to integrate ESG risks comprehensively into the risk management framework to ensure ESG risks are considered holistically in risk management practices. Accordingly, going forward, finding the right recipe for Sustainable Finance initiatives to thrive in the Sri Lankan context would be a challenge for all stakeholders involved.

Way Forward

The Roadmap of the Central Bank articulates a series of strategic activities to implement Sustainable Finance in Sri Lanka, while detailing an action plan to be implemented over the short, medium and long term by the respective stakeholders. The Central Bank expects to issue a taxonomy on Sustainable Finance in collaboration with stakeholders by the end of 2021. Disclosures by financial institutions and other entities on material information on sustainability should be further strengthened giving due consideration to all ESG aspects.

The economic shock stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for enhanced resilience in the global economy. Accordingly, policymakers across the globe will focus on ensuring that the recovery from the pandemic is carried out in a sustainable manner. Going forward, coordinated policy actions are needed to ensure enhanced readiness for Sustainable Finance initiatives across regions and countries. Accordingly, in the new era of post pandemic banking, Sustainable Finance will become an essential lever for achieving social, economic and environmental goals in an economy.

Accordingly, Current and Savings Account (CASA)

ratio increased from 31.4 per cent as at end 2019

to 34.5 per cent as at end 2020. Total borrowings

of the banking sector increased by Rs. 12.8 billion

(0.8 per cent) in 2020 compared to a decrease of

Rs. 84.0 billion (negative growth of 4.8 per cent)

in 2019. This increase was mainly attributed to

Sri Lankan rupee borrowings which reported a

growth of 14.3 per cent (Rs. 99.4 billion) in 2020,

while foreign currency borrowings decreased by

11.1 per cent (US dollar 603.1 million) during 2020

along with the sovereign rating downgrades.

Off-balance sheet exposures: Despite

the challenging business environment,

off-balance sheet exposures reported a growth

of 16.1 per cent (Rs. 675.2 billion) during 2020

compared to a negative growth of 5.3 per cent

(decrease of Rs. 233.5 billion) during 2019.

The main increases during 2020 were in undrawn

(Rs. 278.3 billion) and guarantees & bonds

(Rs. 66.8 billion).

Risks in the Banking Sector

Credit Risk: Considering the difficulties

faced by borrowers due to COVID-19 pandemic,

moratoria were introduced initially for different

segments of the economy and further extended

for certain sectors considering the longer

recovery period of those sectors affected by

the COVID-19 pandemic. Classification of loans to

non-performing categories were frozen during the

period under moratorium and normal classification

rules will be applied upon cessation of the

moratorium. Despite the freezing of classification of

credit facilities under moratorium, NPLs increased

by Rs. 66.4 billion during 2020 compared to an

increase of Rs. 118.5 billion during 2019, stemming

from the challenging business environment that

prevailed for a substantial period in 2020 resulting

in an increase in gross NPL ratio to 4.9 per cent

by end 2020. However, the migration of NPLs to

categories requiring higher provisions had reduced

the net NPL ratio during 2020. Nevertheless,

the actual NPL position will only be reflected

subsequent to cessation of the moratoria which

are still in effect for certain sectors of the economy.

During 2020, total provisions increased by Rs. 74.9

billion, of which specific provisions accounted for

93.5 per cent. Despite the growth in NPLs, higher

increase in provisions resulted in increases in

specific and total provision ratios.

Although 73.1 per cent of credit was mainly

concentrated to 6 economic sectors, individual

banks have diversified their businesses among

various sectors in the economy. Out of the

main sectors, manufacturing, wholesale & retail

trade, agriculture, forestry & fishing, tourism, and

construction sectors reported NPL ratios higher

than the total banking sector average of 4.9 per cent

as at end 2020. Despite the increase in NPL ratios

during 2020, it is still at a manageable level as the

banking sector operated with sufficient provisions

and capital buffers to absorb any adverse impact.

Market Risk

Interest Rate: Interest rate sensitivity ratio

(interest bearing assets as a share of interest-

bearing liabilities with maturities of less than

12 months) decreased to 74.9 per cent as at

end 2020 from 76.5 per cent as at end 2019,

thereby increasing the exposure to interest rate

risk by end 2020 compared to end 2019. Capital

gains on Treasury bonds during 2020 stood at

Rs. 12.2 billion and was higher than Rs. 3.4 billion

recorded during 2019. This was due to more funds

being directed to government securities in 2020

compared to 2019 and the downward movement

in interest rates.

Equity Prices: Equity risk of the banking

sector was minimal throughout 2020. The

exposure of banks’ trading portfolio to the equity

market was Rs. 11.7 billion, which was only

0.1 per cent and 1.5 per cent of total assets and

investments held for trading, respectively, at end

2020.

Exchange Rates: The net foreign currency

exposure of the banking sector decreased to

a short position of US dollar 30.0 million as

at end 2020 compared to a long position of

US dollar 90.3 million as at end 2019, with a

higher increase in foreign currency liabilities

compared to the increase in foreign currency

assets. The net foreign currency exposure as

currency assets stood at 0.3 per cent as at end

2020, decreasing from 1.1 per cent at end 2019.

During 2020, on-balance sheet foreign currency

assets increased mainly due to the increase in

placements with banks and investments, while

the increase in off-balance sheet assets was from

forward purchases and other derivative products.

The increase in on-balance sheet foreign currency

liabilities was attributed to the increase in customer

deposits while the increase in off-balance sheet

liabilities was mainly from forward sales. The

banking sector reported a net foreign currency

revaluation gain of Rs. 16.5 billion during 2020

compared to Rs. 14.2 billion during 2019.

Liquidity Risk: With a higher portion of funds

being directed to liquid assets during 2020,

the banking sector operated with an adequate

level of liquidity. The Domestic Banking Units

(DBUs) of LCBs and LSBs are required to maintain

their Statutory Liquid Assets Ratios (SLARs) above

20.0 per cent. The DBU SLAR increased from

31.0 per cent in December 2019 to 37.3 per cent

in December 2020, while the SLAR of Offshore

Banking Units decreased from 47.1 per cent to

43.2 per cent during this period. Further, the higher

growth in investments during 2020 resulted in a

decrease in the credit to deposits and borrowings

ratio while liquid assets to total assets and liquid

assets to deposits ratios increased.

The Rupee and All Currency Liquidity

Coverage Ratios (LCRs) of the banking

industry stood at 255.9 per cent and 202.1 per

cent, respectively, by end 2020, well above the

regulatory minimum of 90.0 per cent applicable

till end June 2021. In addition, the Net Stable

Funding Ratio (NSFR) introduced in 2019, stood

at 140.7 per cent, well above the regulatory

requirement of 90 per cent applicable until end

June 2021. Total liquid assets amounted to

Rs. 4.9 trillion as at end 2020, of which investments

in government securities represented 69.6 per

cent. The cumulative maturity gap as a percentage

of cumulative liabilities of the banking sector

for maturity buckets up to less than 12 months

maturities widened as at end 2020 compared

to end 2019, indicating better management of

assets and liabilities in the short-term considering

the declining trend in interest rates where more

liabilities get repriced at lower interest rates

compared to assets. However, excessive widening

of maturity gap may lead to an increase in liquidity

risk.

Profitability: Despite interest income of

the banking sector contracting at a lower rate

(4.2 per cent) compared to interest expenses

(6.0 per cent) during 2020 compared to the

previous year, net interest income contracted

only marginally (0.9 per cent). As a result, the

net interest margin decreased from 3.6 per cent

as at end 2019 to 3.1 per cent as at end 2020.

Net interest income decreased by Rs. 3.8 billion

during 2020 compared to the previous year, while

non-interest income increased by Rs. 9.8 billion,

mainly due to higher capital gains on Treasury

bonds and higher foreign currency revaluation

gains during 2020, as a result of depreciation of

Sri Lanka rupee against US dollar. Non-interest

expenses decreased by Rs. 12.1 billion, largely

due to the premises, equipment and establishment

expenses reducing by Rs. 7.7 billion, while loan

loss provisions increased by Rs. 22.6 billion during

2020. As a result, profit before corporate tax was

Rs. 190.0 billion in 2020, which was Rs. 18.2 billion

higher than the previous year.

Profit after tax of the banking industry was

Rs. 136.0 billion during 2020 and increased by

21.7 per cent compared to the previous year

due to changes in tax policies commencing

from year of assessment 2020/21. The increase

in profits was commensurate with the increase

in assets and was reflected in Return on Assets

(ROA) – before tax remaining static at 1.4 per

cent as at end 2019 and end 2020. Meanwhile,

Return on Equity (ROE) – after tax improved from

10.3 per cent to 11.4 per cent. The decrease in

operating costs resulted in the improvement of

the efficiency ratio from 52.6 per cent in 2019 to

51.8 per cent in 2020.

Capital: The banking sector was in

compliance with the capital requirements

during 2020. Despite the relaxation provided

to drawdown the Capital Conservation Buffer

(CCB) by 100 basis points for Domestic

Systematically Important Banks (D-SIBs) and

50 basis points for non D-SIBs considering the

difficulties faced by the banking sector due to

the COVID-19 pandemic, the banking sector

was largely in compliance with the required

Capital Adequacy Ratios without drawing down

the CCB.

Considering the challenges in raising

fresh capital under the current environment,

the deadline to meet the enhanced minimum

capital requirement for banks was extended

till December 2022. With the extension

of recognising the first day impact from

implementation of Sri Lanka Financial Reporting

Standards 9 (SLFRS 9) which is considered for

capital on a staggered basis over a period of

4 years and also to comply with the Basel III

capital requirements, banks were encouraged

to raise high quality capital. As a result, banks

had raised Tier I capital through issuance of new

shares (Rs. 10.2 billion) and buildup of reserves

(Rs. 8.2 billion) during 2020. The regulatory

capital of the banking sector reported a growth

of 3.3 per cent during the year, of which Tier I

capital contributed to 63.2 per cent.

Supervisory and Regulatory Developments

During 2020, the Central Bank continued

to introduce prudential policy measures

and regulations to strengthen the safety

and soundness of the banking sector, while

cautiously relaxing some of the regulations to

facilitate banking sector to adjust to the new

normal and to provide concessions to economic

sectors affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.

A credit support scheme to accelerate the

economic growth was introduced for eligible

Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) borrowers

to complement the fiscal incentives announced

by the Government. This credit support scheme

was followed by a six-month moratorium

scheme and a Rs. 50 billion re-finance scheme

to support the businesses and individuals

affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which

was introduced in March 2020. In this regard,

the Central Bank also introduced a series of

extraordinary regulatory measures to provide

flexibility to licensed banks to support affected

businesses and individuals and to provide

liquidity to banks, considering the potential

impact of COVID-19 on the licensed banks.

Introduction

Economic Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak

The COVID-19 outbreak, an unprecedented global health crisis that emerged in late 2019 has led to many adverse social and economic implications necessitating countries to introduce new strategies and economic measures to overcome the ensuing adverse situation. The lockdown measures implemented owing to the COVID-19 outbreak have restricted cross border movement of people and goods resulting in disruption to economic and trade activities worldwide. Further, reduced investment, i.e., foreign direct investment, and remittances have adversely impacted emerging economies. Therefore, the sharp decline in global GDP amidst the COVID-19 outbreak may result in a slower economic recovery than expected, since the virus is still prevalent with multiple outbreaks and spikes in infections still being reported worldwide. Hence, given the uncertainty and prolonged nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, individuals and business entities including banks need to adapt and transform their business operations to suit the ‘new normal’.

BOX 8Regulation and Supervision of Banks in the ‘New Normal’ amidst the COVID-19 Outbreak

Impact on the Banking Sector

The COVID-19 outbreak has adversely impacted the income and earning capacity of borrowers affecting their ability to service their debt obligations to banks. Further, the creditworthiness of certain borrowers may deteriorate in the long term, and accordingly, the credit quality of the banking sector will depend on the nature and pace of economic recovery. Therefore, it is difficult for banks to fully assess the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on loan classification, expected credit losses, provisioning, credit risk weightings, and capital.

The governments and regulatory authorities have mandated, encouraged, or granted payment holidays and debt moratoria to borrowers under which repayments of interest and principal are delayed creating a potential adverse impact on the cash flows and liquidity positions of banks. Therefore, reduced revenue flows and higher potential losses may adversely affect profitability and reduce capital ratios of banks.

Consumers switching to digital banking platforms and services could also become victims of financial crime or misconduct as deceptive parties may identify

opportunities for fraud, scams or other unlawful activities which may pose legal risks to banks. Many institutions including banks have moved to flexible working arrangements in the ‘new normal’, such as working from home and other remote working arrangements, duty shifts, flexible hours, etc. However, work from home arrangements may also have an adverse impact on operational activities of banks in terms of IT and data security, internal and external fraud, cyber-attacks, internal network capacity, and control mechanisms such as anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements.

Regulatory Measures adopted to suit the ’New Normal’

Regulatory and supervisory authorities worldwide have adopted a wide range of regulatory measures to facilitate banks to support individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 outbreak whilst ensuring the safety and stability of the banking sector. The regulatory measures adopted by several regulatory and supervisory authorities to facilitate supply of credit to the economy are given in Table B 8.1.

Therefore, regulators have facilitated banks to provide debt moratoria including credit guarantee schemes to provide relief to affected borrowers. These measures have allowed credit facilities to be rescheduled or restructured in ways that may be beneficial for both banks and borrowers, to avoid placing borrowers with immediate cash flow constraints in the ‘default’ category and to help restore their business activities. Accordingly, various regulatory authorities have provided guidance on the assessment of asset quality of banks by providing more flexible interpretations on conditions for reclassification of loans.

Flexibility given in global standards, viz. Basel III framework to draw down available capital buffers, i.e. Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB) and Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) built during good times, have been utilised by regulators to allow banks to absorb losses arising from the COVID-19 outbreak without breaching applicable minimum regulatory requirements and to create space for credit growth and facilitate key banking services to the real economy. Further, relaxations have also been provided by reducing liquidity buffers, viz. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) to below 100 per cent to provide liquidity to banks in accordance with guidelines under the Basel III framework.

Many regulatory authorities have also imposed temporary restrictions on capital distributions and other discretionary payments of banks to help preserve capital levels and provide flexibility for banks to support the real economy. Further, certain regulators have deferred the implementation of some regulatory standards and/or extended transitional arrangements, viz. Basel III implementation, capital requirements and accounting rules, to ease the regulatory and compliance burdens on banks.

Supervisory Capacity: Supervisory Processes and Procedures in the ‘New Normal’

The increase in banking sector risks arising from the COVID-19 outbreak, along with pressures on supervisory capacity due to lockdowns, travel restrictions and the need to maintain social distancing, have restricted the conduct of on-site supervision and holding physical meetings with management of banks. Therefore, alternative methods have been adopted to address these limitations such as more intensified off-site supervision and monitoring of banks. Accordingly, banks are required to report more granular data at a higher frequency with existing data templates/formats being updated and specific reporting formats being developed on an ad-hoc basis as and when required, to support the enhanced off-site supervisory monitoring requirements. Further, regulators have also taken measures to continuously reassess supervisory priorities based on risks emanating from the COVID-19 outbreak such as asset quality, capital adequacy, liquidity profiles, and operational resilience of banks. This is to confirm the adequacy of safeguards and buffers to ensure the resilience of banks. In this regard, stress testing is being carried out by supervisory authorities to assess the post COVID-19 impact on banks against a range of possible scenarios to assess credit exposures, liquidity positions, capital, and solvency of individual banks as well as the banking sector. Further, regulators have also required banks to review and strengthen their recovery plans which are essential tools for crisis management in order to identify recovery options that could be quickly implemented, if required.

With on-site supervision being restricted due to lockdown measures, regulatory authorities have taken steps to maintain channels of communication with management and relevant officers of banks through virtual communication modes to obtain the required information. Further, regulatory authorities have also resorted to conducting virtual meetings rather than in person meetings with the Board of Directors, senior management and staff of banks, considering the necessity of adhering to social distancing requirements in the ‘new normal’.

Regulatory and Supervisory Measures adopted by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka amidst the COVID-19 Outbreak

Regulatory Measures Adopted

Various relief measures were provided by the Central Bank to assist businesses and individuals adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak to tide over the difficulties faced during the lock down period by way of debt moratoria, provision of credit facilities at concessionary interest rates and credit guarantee schemes. Further, the Central Bank also implemented various extraordinary regulatory measures to provide flexibility to licensed banks to facilitate credit flows to the economy including permitting Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) and non D-SIBs to draw down the CCBs built during good times, allowing relaxations on classification of non-performing loans, permitting recovery of foreign currency loans in rupees subject to conditions, deferring the enhancement

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2020

2028

of minimum capital requirements by licensed banks from end 2020 to end 2022, and permitting certain assets to be considered as liquid assets, subject to conditions, for the purpose of computing the Statutory Liquid Assets Ratio.

Further, the minimum requirement for LCR and NSFR was reduced to 90 per cent until 30 June 2021 subject to enhanced supervision and frequent reporting. Licensed banks were also allowed to avail of liquidity in rupees, if required, under the framework of emergency loans and advances to licensed banks based on acceptable collateral and liquidity forecasts. Banking Act Directions were issued temporarily restricting discretionary payments of licensed banks to ensure maintenance of appropriate levels of liquidity and prudent management of cash flows by banks. Further, licensed banks were also required to exercise prudence and extreme due diligence when incurring capital expenditure, and to refrain to the extent possible from incurring non-essential expenditure. Accordingly, it is expected that licensed banks would avail these relaxations in the best interest of supporting their customers, and the economy at large, the benefits of which would, in return accrue to the banking sector to remain resilient.

To ease the pressure on the exchange rate and the stress on financial markets due to the impact of COVID-19 outbreak, the Central Bank issued Directions extending the maximum period for the settlement of export credit facilities out of export proceeds to 180 days from the date of shipment, and measures to curtail certain non-essential imports and foreign currency investments by respective banks.

The Central Bank took various steps to keep the general public informed of the regulatory measures adopted amidst the COVID-19 outbreak by issuing press releases, having a dedicated webpage in the Central Bank website providing information on COVID-19 relief measures and conducting virtual educational seminars for the public. Further, the Central Bank also developed a pictorial poster informing the general public on how to conduct banking activities during the COVID-19 outbreak safely and digitally, which was displayed in the Central Bank website and social media and was also circulated among licensed banks. This poster drew the attention of the general public to be vigilant with respect to scams.

Supervisory Measures Adopted in Relation to On-site and Off-site Supervision

Following the initial COVID-19 outbreak, the timelines for addressing supervisory concerns by licensed banks were re-set by granting extended time periods for addressing supervisory concerns which were to be addressed up to 31 May 2020 depending on the severity. Further, the deadline for submission of statutory returns to Bank Supervision Department was extended by two weeks, and the publication of quarterly financial statements was extended by one month.

During the lockdown period, on-site examinations of licensed banks were temporarily halted and examinations of licensed banks were conducted on a remote basis based

on information obtained via e-mails and other electronic means in a secure manner (password protected). Off-site monitoring and supervision of licensed banks were strengthened during the lock down period, requiring more frequent reporting and submitting of returns and information by banks to ensure the safety and soundness of banks.

Subsequent to the lifting of the curfew, on-site examinations were recommenced with the emphasis on reviewing the status of addressing previous supervisory concerns, level of internal controls, and nature and extent of actions taken by the bank in response to the pandemic, along with a review of details of any internal assessments of the impact. Bank supervision examiners were advised to strictly adhere to health guidelines published by the authorities and to limit physical interactions with front line bank employees. Measures were also taken to conduct more virtual meetings rather than in person meetings with banks’ management, auditors, etc., considering the requirements to adhere to health guidelines and to minimise possibilities of contracting COVID-19.

Way Forward

The COVID-19 outbreak required supervisory and regulatory authorities as well as the banking sector to adapt to the operational constraints and heightened risks resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. Consequently, regulatory authorities would also need to continuously adapt and monitor early warning frameworks of banks to identify and remedy banks’ critical deficiencies and gauge whether supervisory action towards specific banks is warranted on the basis of risk assessments. The Central Bank will also continue to closely monitor the liquidity and capital positions of licensed banks and any early warnings of stress to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking sector. Further, the Central Bank may also consider implementing additional extraordinary regulatory measures to address any potential challenges to the banking sector, if required. Therefore, supervisory flexibility to quickly respond to such changes is essential in the ‘new normal’ amidst the COVID-19 outbreak. Hence, supervisory authorities including the Central Bank would need to improve and extend the use of technology, viz. Suptech via Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning and data analytics, etc. Adoption of Suptech could help improve oversight, surveillance and analytical capabilities of supervisory authorities, and help generate real time risk indicator dashboards to support more forward looking, risk based supervisory approaches and practices going forward in the ‘new normal’ amidst the COVID-19 outbreak.

by LCBs and National Savings Bank to ease

the pressure on the exchange rate and the

stress on financial markets due to the impact of

COVID-19 outbreak, amending the regulations

on ownership limits on issued capital carrying

voting rights for licensed banks, considering

the benefits to the banking system through

the investments by Multilateral Financial

Organisations (MFOs) in the shareholdings of

licensed banks, and introducing amendments

to regulations to facilitate Financial Derivative

Transactions of licensed banks considering the

necessity to encourage foreign currency inflows

to the country.

During the year 2020, amendments were made

to certain regulations applicable for licensed

banks. Guidelines on adoption of SLFRS

9: Financial Instruments by licensed banks

were issued to establish consistent practice

of accounting treatments by banks amidst the

COVID-19 environment. Enhancing the annual

turnover threshold for SMEs to Rs. 1 billion

for regulatory purposes of licensed banks and

updating the eligibility criteria for valuers of

licensed banks under the Regulatory Framework

on Valuation of Immovable Properties of

licensed banks, are some other amendments

done during the year. All prudential regulations

issued to licensed banks during the year 2020,

including extraordinary measures taken amidst

COVID-19 outbreak, are provided in Part III of

this report.

During 2020, the Central Bank adopted a

more robust risk-based examination mechanism,

and a comprehensive supervisory guidance

framework based on the rating outcomes of an

internal rating model: Bank Sustainability Rating

Indicator (BSRI). The Central Bank also initiated

formulating a framework for Group-wide

Consolidated Risk-based Supervision (GCRS)

Further concessions were granted in 2021 to

identified economic sectors such as tourism

and passenger transportation sectors, on need

basis, considering the ongoing travel restrictions

and disruption to economic activities due to the

subsequent waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Maximum interest rates applicable on lending

products were reduced to support marginal

borrowers. Maximum interest rates for pawning

advances were imposed considering the

necessity to provide relief to individuals who

are pawning gold jewellery to meet short-term

financing needs due to the adverse economic

conditions resulting from the COVID-19

outbreak. Interest rates on lending products of

licensed banks were further reduced in August

2020 to help marginal borrowers. Further, in

December 2020, the maximum interest rate

for mortgage-backed housing loans obtained

by salaried employees in confirmed service in

the public and private sectors was capped at

7 per cent per annum, considering the reduction

of policy interest rates, significant levels of

excess liquidity prevailing in the domestic

money market and the need for a continued

downward adjustment in lending rates to revive

the economy. This measure is also expected to

support the expansion of home ownership of

salaried employees and provide an additional

stimulus to the domestic construction sector

and its supply chains.

Considering the multifaceted challenges faced

by the economy during 2020, the Central Bank

introduced a range of policy measures to ensure

stability of the financial sector. These policy

measures include the extension of the maximum

period for the recovery of accommodation to

exporters to 180 days from the date of shipment,

measures to curtail imports and investments in

Sri Lanka International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs)

of banking groups and necessary amendments

to facilitate GCRS are also being drafted in

the new Banking Act, considering the need

to address any contagion risk to the licensed

banks arising from the entities within banking

groups.

Further, the Central Bank prepared a Concept

Paper to establish a dedicated Asset Management

Company (AMC) to purchase and manage

non-performing assets of both banks and

non-banking financial institutions (NBFIs)

which are under resolution and are operating

in a viable manner. Establishment of an AMC

will be beneficial in reinforcing the financial

system stability by enabling banks and NBFIs

to restructure their balance sheets through

reduction of NPLs and to utilise liquidity

generated through such measures to direct

credit to more productive economic sectors.

8.3. Performance of Non-Bank Financial Institutions

Licensed Finance Companies (LFCs) and Specialised Leasing Companies (SLCs) Sector

The LFCs and SLCs sector performance

deteriorated during the year, with negative

credit growth and high NPLs. In addition to the

COVID-19 pandemic related growth impediments,

the reduction of consumer confidence due to

issues observed in the sector contributed towards

the sluggish performance. However, despite

certain institutions encountering difficulties to

fulfill regulatory requirements at an individual

level, the sector remained stable with capital and

liquidity maintained at healthy levels above the

minimum regulatory requirements. Total assets

of the sector stood at Rs. 1,401.6 billion by

end-December 2020, representing 5.9 per cent

of Sri Lanka’s financial system. The funding mix

was dominated by deposits while borrowings of

the sector declined compared to the previous

year. The Central Bank continued to introduce

prudential measures to maintain the stability of

the sector and granted regulatory flexibility to

support the sector to face the challenges posed

by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Business Expansion

Outreach: At end-2020, the sector comprised

40 LFCs1 and 3 SLCs. There were 1,517 branches

and 460 other outlets of the sector, of which 1,001

branches (66.0 per cent) were concentrated outside

the Western Province.

Assets: Assets of the sector contracted,

recording a negative growth rate of 2.2 per

cent (Rs. 31.0 billion) during the year reaching

Rs. 1,401.6 billion compared to the 0.1 per cent

growth reported in 2019. Loans and advances

accounted for 74.2 per cent of the total assets

of the sector. Finance leases accounted for the

highest share of loans and advances, representing

53.7 per cent, followed by the secured loans

and advances (36.2 per cent). Lending of the

sector slowed considerably during the year as

business activities continued to contract amidst the

COVID-19 lockdowns and curtailment of vehicle

imports. Credit provided by the LFCs and SLCs

sector contracted by 5.7 per cent (Rs. 62.9 billion)

to Rs. 1,039.9 billion compared to the contraction

of 3.0 per cent in the corresponding period of 2019.

The investment portfolio recorded a growth

of 20.2 per cent to Rs. 158.8 billion in 2020

compared to the growth of 20.5 per cent in

2019, mainly due to increase in prices of

shares, increased investments in unit trusts,

debt securities held for trading and government

securities maturing in less than 12 months free

of lien. Other assets, mainly cash balances with

banks and financial institutions and fixed assets,

increased by 2.6 per cent during the year.

Liabilities: Customer deposits continued to

dominate the liabilities of the LFCs and SLCs

sector, accounting for a share of 53.4 per

cent of liabilities. The deposits contracted by

1.1 per cent (Rs. 8.1 billion) to reach Rs.748.6

billion while borrowings recorded a sharp decline of

19.1 per cent (Rs. 77.6 billion) reaching Rs. 328.0

billion during the year.

Resources

Profitability: Net interest income of the sector

during the year was Rs. 111.2 billion, which

was a decline of 5.3 per cent (Rs. 6.2 billion)

compared to 2019. This was due to the decline in

economic activities with the COVID-19 outbreak

resulting in a reduction in both interest income

and interest expenses. The interest income

and interest expenses declined by 12.0 per cent

(Rs. 31.3 billion) and 17.6 per cent (Rs. 25.0 billion),

respectively. Net interest margin of the sector

(net interest income as a percentage of average

assets) declined to 7.3 per cent in 2020 from the

7.7 per cent in 2019, due to a decline in the net

interest income and a marginal increase in (gross)

average assets.

Non-interest income declined by 18.7 per cent

(Rs. 7.4 billion), while non-interest expenses

declined by 16.4 per cent (Rs. 15.4 billion) during

2020, affecting sector profitability. Non-interest

expenses declined mainly due to decreased

administrative expenses (Rs. 6.0 billion), loss

on valuation/disposal of repossessed items

(Rs. 1.9 billion), reduction in staff costs (Rs. 3.3

billion) and other expenses (Rs. 2.2 billion). The

loan loss provisions made against NPLs during

the year was Rs. 38.2 billion, which was an

increase of 26.4 per cent (Rs. 8.0 billion), when

compared with the provision made in 2019.

The sector posted a profit after tax of Rs. 13.7

billion, a decline of 6.1 per cent compared to the

profit recorded in year 2019, mainly due to the

significant decline in interest income recorded

during the period.

Capital: The sector as a whole remained resilient

with capital maintained above the minimum

required levels during the year. The capital base

improved to Rs. 218.9 billion by end December

2020 compared with Rs. 182.0 billion recorded

by end December 2019, with the infusion of new

capital by LFCs to meet regulatory requirements

and cancellation of licence of a LFC with a large

negative net worth. Upon reaching the deadline,

an extension of 12 months was granted to LFCs

to comply with minimum core capital requirements

considering the economic impact of the COVID-19

outbreak. The new target is to reach Rs. 2.5 billion

by 01 January 2022. The sector core capital and

total risk weighted capital ratios increased to

14.5 per cent and 15.7 per cent, respectively, by

end December 2020 from the reported levels of

11.1 per cent and 12.5 per cent at end December

2019.

Further, the Financial Sector Consolidation

Master Plan (FSCMP) was introduced to

address non-compliance with the minimum

core capital requirement and/or the minimum

capital adequacy ratios by several LFCs. Several

regulatory actions were initiated by the Central

Bank in addition to introducing the FSCMP with a

view to avoid further deterioration of the financial

position, maintain the stability of such institutions

and safeguard the interest of depositors.

Risks in the LFCs and SLCs Sector

Credit Risk: Total gross loans and advances

reduced by 3.0 per cent (Rs. 35.9 billion) by

end December 2020 on year-on-year basis,

compared to a reduction of 0.9 per cent

(Rs. 10.3 billion) recorded at end December

2019. The gross NPL ratio increased to

13.9 per cent by end December 2020 from

10.6 per cent reported as at end December 2019,

showing a severe deterioration in the asset quality

of the sector. The net NPL ratio also increased

to 4.2 per cent by end December 2020 from

3.4 per cent reported at end December 2019. This

was mainly due to the slowing down in the economic

activities following the COVID-19 pandemic. Gross

NPL ratio has slightly reduced when compared with

the end June 2020 ratio of 14.1 per cent. NPLs of

the sector could be underestimated due to debt

moratorium together with other concessions and

NPL levels may increase further after the end of

the debt moratorium. Provision coverage ratio

marginally increased to 58.9 per cent in December

2020, compared with 56.6 per cent reported in

December 2019.

Market Risk: The sector continued to experience

low market risk which comprise of interest rate

risk and equity risk.

Interest Rate Risk: With the objective of reducing

interest rates on lending, maximum interest rates

on deposits and debt instruments were further

reduced since April 2020. Accordingly, interest rate

risk of the sector decelerated with the prevailing

negative mismatch in the maturity profile of the

interest-bearing assets and liabilities.

Equity Risk: Equity risk of the sector remained low

during the period under review as the exposure to

equity market in the form of investment in listed

shares is 1.0 per cent of the sector assets at the

end December 2020.

Liquidity Risk: The sector maintained adequate

liquidity buffers well above the regulatory

minimum levels by end December 2020. The

overall regulatory liquid assets available in the

sector indicated a surplus of Rs. 89.0 billion as

against the stipulated minimum requirement of

Rs. 50.7 billion. The regulatory relaxations of

the Central Bank by relaxing the liquid asset

requirements also facilitated the sector to escalate

the liquidity surplus. The liquidity ratio (liquid assets

against deposits and borrowing) increased to

13.0 per cent by end December 2020, compared

to 11.3 per cent recorded at end December 2019.

Primary Dealer Companies in Government Securities

As at end 2020, there were 6 LCBs and 7 Primary

Dealer companies appointed as Primary

Dealers (PDs) in the government securities

market. Union Bank of Colombo PLC ceased its

operations as a PD with effect from 01 May 2020

and the appointment of the Natwealth Security

Limited (NWSL) was withdrawn w.e.f. 30 November

2020. Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC (PABC)

and Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) have been

suspended from carrying on business and activities

of a PD since 15 August 2017 and 06 July 2017,

respectively. Participation in primary auctions

was prohibited for Entrust Securities PLC (ESP)

w.e.f. 24 July 2017. Accordingly, only 5 LCBs and

5 PD companies were active in the government

securities market as PDs.

Assets and Liabilities: The total assets of

PD companies increased by 12.4 per cent to

Rs. 87.2 billion in 2020. The total investment

portfolio of government securities, consisting of

trading, available for sale and held to maturity

portfolios amounted to Rs. 80.1 billion at end 2020,

recording an increase of 15.5 per cent during the

year. The trading portfolio increased to Rs. 62.6

billion by end 2020, from Rs. 57.5 billion recorded

at end 2019 while the held to maturity portfolio

increased to Rs. 14.7 billion at end 2020 from

Rs. 8.6 billion at end 2019. Available for Sale

Portfolio decreased to Rs. 2.8 billion by end 2020

compared to Rs. 3.3 billion as at end 2019.

Profitability: PD companies reported profit

after tax of Rs. 4.9 billion during 2020 against

that of Rs. 3.8 billion during 2019, indicating

a significant improvement in profitability

consequent to the decline in yield rates. The

significant increase in capital gains recorded in

2020 compared to 2019 has largely contributed to

the increase in profits despite the mark-to-market

loss recorded by PD companies in year 2020.

Consequently, Return on Assets (ROA) and Return

on Equity (ROE) of PD companies increased to

7.6 per cent and 30.5 per cent, respectively, by end

2020 from 6.0 per cent and 28.5 per cent recorded

in 2019, respectively.

Capital: Equity of PD companies increased

by 11.2 per cent largely due to accumulation

of profit during the year. The Risk Weighted

Capital Adequacy Ratio (RWCAR) of the PD

companies was well above the minimum required

amount of 10.0 per cent despite marginal decline to

27.0 per cent as at the end 2020 from 27.6 per cent

reported as at the end 2019.

Exposure to Risks

Market Risk: The proportion of trading portfolio

to total investment portfolio of PD companies

decreased marginally and was recorded at

78.2 per cent as at end 2020 compared to

82.9 per cent as at end 2019, reflecting a marginal

decrease in the relative market risk exposure of

the industry.

Liquidity Risk: The overall liquidity risk

exposure of PD companies increased due to

the increase in over-night negative mismatch in

the maturity profile of assets and liabilities of

the PD companies by end 2020. The overnight

negative mismatch increased to Rs. 13.1 billion or

79.5 per cent of the overnight liabilities as at end

2020, from Rs. 11.0 billion (72.1 per cent) as at

end 2019. In view of holding a large volume of

government securities, which are free of credit risk,

by PDs and also the ability to use such government

securities as collateral for obtaining funds to bridge

any unforeseen liquidity gaps, the liquidity risk

profile of PDs remained low throughout the year

except for one PD who was facing liquidity issues.

Most of the PDs had stand-by contingency funding

arrangements to bridge any liquidity gaps.

Market Conduct

Primary Market Activities: The participation in

primary auctions in respect of Treasury bills

and Treasury bonds by PDs has shown a mixed

performance during 2020. Of the total bids accepted

at 53 T-bills auctions conducted in 2020, the

effective participation of LCBs appointed as PDs,

PD Companies and Employees’ Provident Fund

(EPF) accounted to 58.4 per cent, 41.3 per cent and

0.3 per cent, respectively. At 15 T-bond auctions

conducted during 2020, effective participation of

LCBs appointed as PDs, PD companies and EPF

accounted to 31.5 per cent, 35.3 per cent and

33.2 per cent, respectively.

Secondary Market Activities of PD companies:

Secondary market transactions in government

securities (in terms of value) by PD companies

decreased by 6.6 per cent to Rs. 7,576.5 billion in

2020, out of which repo transactions accounted

to 72.4 per cent. During 2020, outright purchases

and outright sales by PD Companies increased by

12.5 per cent and 35.8 per cent respectively,

compared to 2019.

Licensed Microfinance Companies

Licensed Microfinance Companies (LMFC) sector

reported assets of Rs. 6.8 billion as at end 2020

with a 16.0 per cent growth, compared to the

preceding year. Sejaya Microcredit Limited was

granted a licence, under the Microfinance Act, No.

6 of 2016 by the Monetary Board of the Central

Bank as the fourth LMFC. Microfinance loans and

advances accounted for the largest share of total

assets with 85.3 per cent. Microfinance loans and

advances were recorded at Rs. 5.8 billion by end

2020 in comparison to the Rs. 4.7 billion reported

at end 2019, with a growth of 21.5 per cent. The

LMFCs were adversely affected by the COVID-19

pandemic, which resulted in the sector reporting a

loss of Rs. 0.1 billion during 2020. In order to enable

such LMFCs to utilise the available liquid assets

to meet operational costs the Monetary Board

withdrew the requirement for LMFCS to maintain

liquid assets as per the Microfinance Act. The core

capital level of the sector remained at Rs. 2.2 billion

and all LMFCs were compliant with the minimum

prudential regulations on core capital.

Insurance Sector

By end 2020, there were 27 insurance companies

operating in the country, comprising 13

long-term insurance companies, 12 general

insurance companies and 2 companies involved

in both long-term and general insurance business.

The insurance sector reported a significant

growth in its asset base in 2020. The total assets

of the insurance sector grew by 14.6 per cent by

end 2020 on a y-o-y basis and reached Rs. 790.1

of profitability was observed in general insurance

sub-sector by 104.9 per cent during the year

while a decline in profitability was observed in the

long-term insurance subsector by 19.1 per cent in

2020. Decline in claims due to lockdowns imposed

by the Government for controlling the spread of

COVID-19 virus, may have contributed to this

increase. Meanwhile, the underwriting profits of the

6.8 per cent by end 2019. Also, the general

insurance subsector’s investment on equity

decreased to 7.4 per cent by end 2020 from

7.7 per cent recorded by end 2019.

Superannuation Funds

The total assets of the superannuation funds

were reported to be Rs. 3,639.7 billion at

end 2020 contributing to 15.4 per cent of the

financial sector assets. The sector was dominated

by the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), which

accounts for 77.6 per cent of the total assets of the

superannuation sector. In addition to EPF, there

are two other publicly managed funds, namely, the

Employees’ Trust Fund (ETF) and the state sector

Public Service Provident Fund (PSPF).

Employees’ Provident Fund

As per the Employees’ Provident Fund Act,

No. 15 of 1958, the Monetary Board of the Central

Bank is entrusted with the custodianship of

the Fund while the Commissioner of Labour

is entrusted with the general administration

of the Fund. The EPF Department facilitates the

Monetary Board to perform its powers, duties and

functions as per the provisions of the EPF Act.

The total value of the Fund increased by

Rs. 283.9 billion to Rs. 2,824.3 billion as at end

2020 from Rs. 2,540.4 billion recorded by end

2019, recording an 11.2 per cent growth. This

increase was due to the combined effect of the

net contributions of the members (contributions

less refund payments) and the income generated

through investments of the Fund. Total liability

to the members stood at Rs. 2,767.8 billion as at

end 2020 recording a 10.8 per cent increase from

Rs. 2,497.6 billion as at end 2019. The total

contribution for the year 2020 decreased by

4.1 per cent to Rs. 150.7 billion, while the total

amount of refunds made to the members and

their legal heirs was Rs. 109.7 billion in 2020,

which was a decrease of 13.1 per cent over 2019.

Accordingly, the net contribution to the Fund

was Rs. 41.0 billion compared to Rs. 30.9 billion

recorded in the previous year. The annual profit of

the Fund increased by 9.9 per cent to Rs. 244.9

billion in 2020 from Rs. 222.8 billion recorded in the

previous year. This was mainly due to the increase

in the interest income by Rs. 22.7 billion.

The total investment portfolio (book value) of

the Fund grew by 11.0 per cent to Rs. 2,829.5

billion as at end of 2020 from Rs. 2,548.7 billion

as at end of 2019. The investment policy of the

Fund is focused on providing a long-term positive

real rate of return to the members, while ensuring

the safety of the Fund and availability of adequate

level of liquidity to meet refund payments and other

expenses of the Fund. Accordingly, as at end 2020,

the investment portfolio consisted of 93.4 per cent

in government securities, 2.8 per cent in equity,

1.2 per cent in corporate debentures, 2.0 per cent

in fixed deposits and the remaining 0.6 per cent in

Reverse Repurchase agreements.

Investment Income: The total investment

income of the Fund was Rs. 285.4 billion in

2020, and recorded an increase of 10.2 per cent

compared to previous year. Interest income,

including amortisation gains, continued to be

the major source of income to the Fund which

Fund. Further, the regular processes of reporting

the departmental risks to the Monetary Board

through the related oversight committees of the

Central Bank was continued throughout the year

to maintain the accountability and transparency of

such activities. However, the significant changes

that took place during the year due to sharp

reductions in the market interest rates, unexpected

fluctuations in the equity market and changes in

risk ratings of counterparties led the necessity of

reshaping the prevailing risk parameters as well.

Accordingly, action has been initiated to revisit

and revise the prevailing investment guidelines

in order to provide an acceptable avenue for the

business units to take the investment decisions

considering the market situations.

Employees’ Trust Fund

The Employees’ Trust Fund (ETF) that

contributed to 10.5 per cent of the asset

base of the superannuation sector

recorded an improvement in terms of its

asset base, number of members and the

total contributions during the year. Out of

15.9 million member accounts of the ETF, only

2.5 million accounts were active in 2020. The

number of employers contributing to the fund

declined to 75,756 by end 2020 from 82,375

by end 2019. Total member balance of the

ETF increased by 2.5 per cent and reached

Rs. 347.6 billion by end 2020 compared to

Rs. 339.2 billion by end 2019. The total contribution

of the ETF decreased by 1.8 per cent and reached

Rs. 27.0 billion, while total refunds decreased by

6.1 per cent and reached Rs. 18.6 billion, during

2020.

The total assets of the ETF increased by

10.8 per cent during the year and reached

Rs. 380.4 billion by end 2020. ETF’s

investments improved to Rs. 358.4 billion in 2020,

grew by 8.9 per cent to Rs. 277.4 billion in 2020

from Rs. 254.7 billion in 2019. Dividend income

decreased by 52.2 per cent to Rs. 3.0 billion in

2020 compared to Rs. 6.2 billion in 2019. Net

Gain/Loss on financial instruments at fair value

through profit or loss recorded a net gain of

Rs. 5.0 billion in 2020 compared to net loss of

Rs. 1.9 billion in 2019.

Overall Return of the Fund: The Fund earned

a total gross income of Rs. 285.6 billion in

2020, recording an increase of 10.1 per cent

compared with the previous year. After adjusting

for operating expenditure and tax expenditure,

the net profit for the year 2020 was Rs. 244.9

billion which is an increase of 9.9 per cent

compared to that of 2019. EPF was able to earn

10.6 per cent Return on Average Investment

in 2020 while maintaining operating expenses

to gross income ratio at 0.58 per cent in 2020.

Furthermore, the tax expenditure of the Fund

increased by Rs. 4.1 billion compared to 2019.

Nevertheless, the adoption of SLFRS 9, the

Accounting Standard applicable for classification

and measurement of Financial Instruments,

where listed equity instruments were measured

at fair value and under the prevailed market

conditions, a marked to market gain of Rs. 5.0

billion was recorded as an income for the year

2020. Accordingly, EPF has taken measures to

declare an interest rate of around 9.0 per cent

on member balances in 2020 after transferring

Rs. 13.0 billion to the Profit Equalisation Reserve.

Risk Management: Even under the COVID-19

pandemic situation, the investment activities

were conducted in adherence with the

existing risk management framework while

maintaining the internal control environment

as appropriate. Accordingly, the investment

activities were continued throughout the year

while ensuring the safety and optimal return of the

which is an increase of 6.9 per cent compared

to 2019. Out of these investments, in 2020,

81.0 per cent was invested in government

securities compared to 77.7 per cent recorded in

2019. The share of investments in fixed deposits

decreased to 13.6 per cent in 2020 compared

to 16.7 per cent in 2019. However, the share of

investments in equity increased marginally to

3.3 per cent in year 2020 compared to

3.2 per cent reported in 2019. The fund managed

to secure a rate of return of 8.0 per cent on its

member balances for the year.

Other Superannuation Funds

The Public Service Provident Fund (PSPF),

which accounted for 1.9 per cent of the

superannuation sector, increased in terms

of the number of members and the net

contributions, while reporting a growth of

10.1 per cent and reached Rs. 70 billion in

terms of assets. The number of active members

of the fund increased to 235,884 by end 2020,

compared to 222,739 by end 2019. Meanwhile,

the investments of the fund also grew by

11.7 per cent reaching Rs. 69.6 billion by end

2020. The net contribution was Rs. 507.0 million

during 2020, compared to the net contribution

of Rs. 491.0 million reported in 2019. PSPF

invested 40.5 per cent of its total investments in

government securities in 2020. The rate of return

on member balances was 9.8 per cent for the

year 2020.

Approved Pension and Provident Funds

(APPFs) accounts for 10.0 per cent of the

superannuation sector by end 2020. The

number of members covered by private provident

funds was 186,491 at end 2020 and total assets

of the APPFs is estimated to be Rs. 364.9 billion

at end 2020.

8.4 Performance of Financial

Markets

Domestic Money Market

Market Liquidity

The domestic money market recorded a

persistent liquidity surplus during 2020. This

was mainly driven by a number of factors, such

as the reduction in the Statutory Reserve Ratio

(SRR), purchasing Treasury bills at the primary

market and foreign exchange purchases by the

Central Bank. Funds disbursement under the

special loan schemes introduced by the Central

Bank in view of the COVID-19 pandemic and the

monetary operations of the Central Bank also

contributed to the liquidity surplus. The Central

Bank continued its accommodative monetary

policy stance in order to address disturbances

arising due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and

reduced the policy interest rates by a cumulative

of 250 basis points in five occasions during

2020. As a result, the Standing Deposit Facility

Rate (SDFR) and Standing Lending Facility Rate

(SLFR) were reduced to their lowest levels of

4.50 per cent and 5.50 per cent, respectively.

In addition, the Central Bank introduced

several monetary policy relaxation measures

to ensure certainty of the availability of liquidity

in the money market, considering the need for

supporting the financial system and economic

activities. Further, the Central Bank also reduced

the SRR applicable on rupee deposit liabilities of

LCBs by 3.00 percentage points during the year

in two stages in March and June 2020 to a low

level of 2.00 per cent, thereby injecting around

Rs. 180 billion liquidity to the domestic money

market. At the same time, since mid-April 2020,

with the view to provide more flexibility in liquidity

management, LCBs were permitted to reduce

the minimum daily reserve balances held by a

LCB with the Central Bank from 90 per cent to

20 per cent of the required reserves on any given

day. Along with the revision to SRR, the amount

of till cash (currency notes and coins at the vaults

of LCBs) considered for the computation of SRR

of LCBs was also reduced to 1.00 per cent from

2.00 per cent from mid-June 2020. In order to

ensure the availability of emergency funding to

banking institutions at reduced interest rates, the

Central Bank reduced the Bank Rate, which is an

administratively determined interest rate by the

Central Bank, by 650 basis points in April, May

and July 2020 to 8.5 per cent while allowing it to

be determined automatically with a margin of 300

basis points above the SLFR.

The Central Bank conducted both

repurchase and reverse repurchase auctions

under Open Market Operations (OMOs)

in the first half of 2020 depending on the

variations in market liquidity levels. However,

as surplus liquidity position continued to prevail

in the domestic money market, the Central

Bank abstained from conducting auctions under

OMOs during the period from 17 June 2020 to

24 September 2020, while continuing to absorb

excess liquidity through the Standing Deposit

Facility (SDF) on overnight basis. Recognising

the need for ensuring the availability of adequate

liquidity, mainly in view of the anticipated reduction

in domestic rupee liquidity due to scheduled

foreign loan repayments of the country, the

auctions under OMOs were recommenced since

25 September 2020, in spite of the continued

surplus liquidity in the domestic money market.

Accordingly, the Central Bank conducted long

term and short term reverse repo auctions for

LCBs, and Standalone Primary Dealers (SPDs)

on need basis. As the domestic money market

liquidity was augmented to substantially high

levels due to primary purchases of Treasury bills

by the Central Bank, auctions under OMOs were

not conducted since 12 November 2020.

Money Market Interest Rates

Following the monetary policy relaxation

measures of the Central Bank, the Average

Weighted Call Money Rate (AWCMR), which

is the operating target of the current monetary

policy framework of the Central Bank, was

allowed to move towards the lower bound of

the Standing Rate Corridor (SRC) in order to

induce a downward adjustment in the market

interest rates. During the first half of 2020, the

Central Bank was able to maintain the AWCMR

around the middle rate of the SRC through its

monetary operations. Nevertheless, during the

second half of the year, with an aim to drive down

market lending rates in a bid to bolster economic

activities, while allowing high liquidity surplus to

prevail in the money market, the Central Bank

facilitated the AWCMR to remain closer to the floor

rate of the SRC. Accordingly, by end December

2020, the AWCMR remained just above the lower

bound of the SRC at 4.55 per cent. At the same

time, the Average Weighted Repo Rate (AWRR)

also moved broadly in line with the movements

of the AWCMR. Accordingly, AWRR remained at

4.57 per cent by end December 2020 indicating

a substantial fund availability in the repurchase

market.

Other Developments

Monetary policy implementation of the Central

Bank during 2020, was focused on assuring the

availability of adequate liquidity in the domestic

money market. Adequate liquidity with low interest

rates, enabled smooth operations of the financial

system during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020,

the Central Bank provided long-term liquidity

assistance to LCBs through long term reverse repo

auctions for an extended period of three months.

Moreover, the Central Bank extended the Liquidity

Support Facility (LSF) for SPDs for a period up

to 15 days. Introduction of new loan schemes

by the Central Bank to provide credit facilities

at concessionary interest rates towards the

businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic

was instrumental in expanding the collateral base

eligible for obtaining funds from the Central Bank.

In order to ensure availability of adequate funds

towards economically significant sectors having

special liquidity needs during the COVID-19

pandemic period and to support the revival of

economic activities, the Central Bank introduced

new credit schemes based on the provisions

of the Section 83(1) of the Monetary Law Act,

No. 58 of 1949 (MLA). Accordingly, the Central

Bank introduced a liquidity facility, namely Liquidity

Facility to the Contractors and Suppliers (LFCS)

to provide funds to LCBs at a concessionary

rate of 1.00 per cent per annum for a period of

up to 180 days for the purpose of on-lending to

the contractors and suppliers of the Government

in construction, pharmaceutical and such

other identified sectors at a rate not exceeding

4.00 per cent. The LCBs provided credit facilities to

such contractors and suppliers of the Government,

upon the receipt of a letter of acceptance for

payment of outstanding bills issued by the

Government, and the Central Bank disbursed

funds under the LFCS to LCBs based on the

promissory notes from such LCBs which have

been backed by Treasury bills and Treasury bonds

as eligible collaterals. As at end December 2020,

about Rs. 7.2 billion was disbursed by the Central

Bank to LCBs under the LFCS in order to support

the eligible borrowers. In addition, the Central

Bank provided funds to LCBs under the Saubagya

COVID-19 Renaissance Facility (SCRF) at the

concessionary rate of 1.00 per cent against the

pledge of a broad spectrum of collaterals, on the

condition that LCBs in turn will on-lend to domestic

By end December 2020, about Rs. 83.4 billion was

disbursed to LCBs under SCRF.

Domestic Foreign Exchange Market

During the year, Sri Lankan rupee

depreciated against US dollar by 2.6 per cent

from Rs. 181.63 as at end December 2019 to

Rs. 186.41 as at end December 2020. Subsequent

to the post-election economic stability, the year

2020 started at an enduring exchange rate around

Rs. 181 level, however, which did not prevail for

long. A significant pressure on the exchange rate

was observed since mid-March and exchange

rate reached almost Rs. 200 levels in April due to

lower levels of export conversions, tourism related

inflows and remittances as well as increased

repatriations of foreign investments from the

capital markets following the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, this pressure was eased through modest

FX interventions by the Central Bank along with the

introduction of new Sell – Buy FX Swap auctions

to the market and the policy directions taken by

the Government and the Central Bank. Though the

pressure was gradually eased towards the end-

September 2020, with the emergence of a second

wave of COVID-19 pandemic, the pressure on the

exchange rate was again observed due to low level

of FX inflows to the market together with the FX

outflows on account of imports with the gradual

relaxations of the restrictions and FX repatriations,

such as dividends and FX loan repayments. This

situation was further aggravated by the consecutive

rating downgrading of Sri Lanka by global rating

agencies. However, owing to the modest FX

interventions and several policy measures taken

by the Central Bank, exchange rate was stood at

around Rs. 185 levels by end 2020. Further, in line

with the overall depreciation of Sri Lankan Rupee

against the US dollar, the average US dollar buying

and selling exchange rates of commercial banks

for telegraphic transfers as of end 2020 were at

Rs. 184.12 and Rs. 189.18, whilst comparative

figures in end 2019 were at Rs. 179.66 and

Rs. 183.33, respectively. Meanwhile, during the

year 2020, the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated

against euro, Sterling pound, Japanese yen and

Australian dollar.

The Central Bank was a net buyer in the

domestic foreign exchange market during the

year 2020. Despite the modest sale of foreign

exchange to the market to minimise the excessive

volatility in the exchange rate, the Central Bank

was able to resume purchasing of FX from the

market to build-up foreign exchange reserves of

the country. Accordingly, during the year 2020, the

Central Bank absorbed US dollars 685.4 million

and supplied US dollars 402.9 million resulting in a

net purchase of US dollars 282.5 million.

During the year 2020, trading volumes in the

domestic foreign exchange inter-bank market

decreased by 5.4 per cent compared to that

of 2019. The total volume of inter-bank foreign

exchange transactions amounted to US dollars

18.4 billion during the year 2020 compared to

US dollars 19.4 billion in 2019. In line with this,

the daily average volumes in the inter-bank

foreign exchange market decreased to US dollars

77 million in 2020, from US dollars 80 million in 2019.

securities. Accordingly, the primary market

Weighted Average Yield Rate (WAYR) of the

benchmark 364-day Treasury bill reduced to

5.05 per cent by end 2020 from 8.45 per cent

recorded at end December 2019 while other

government securities’ primary market yield rates,

including medium to long-term Treasury bonds also

recorded significant reduction in yields by end 2020.

The unfavourable international capital

market conditions with elevated secondary

market yield levels for Sri Lanka’s International

Sovereign Bonds (ISBs), continuous tension

with respect to sovereign rating actions and

general risk averseness by investors for papers

issued by frontier and developing economies

restricted raising new funds from the

conventional foreign capital markets in 2020.

As a result, the ISB matured in October 2020 was

settled without resorting to new ISB issuance with

a strategic perspective to reduce external liabilities

through a mixture of financing, accumulation of

foreign reserves and management of foreign

exchange outflows. In the domestic foreign

currency financing front, significantly reduced

demand and liquidity for Sri Lanka Development

Bonds were observed and only US dollars 507.0

million was raised against the maturing amount of

US dollars 952.8 million during 2020.

Reflecting the withdrawal of foreign portfolio

investments from the frontier and developing

economies due to pandemic and Sri Lanka

Government Securities Market

A downward adjustment in government

securities yield rates was generally observed

throughout 2020. The predictable issuance

calendar published in line with envisaged strategic

issuance arrangements, resource availability,

and enhanced money market liquidity were the

contributory factors for the downward adjustment

in the short-term government securities yield rates

during the early part of 2020. Meanwhile, in view

of the measures taken to combat the adverse

economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic,

particularly the continuation of the accommodative

monetary policy stance, issuance arrangements

envisaged in line with the availability of debt service

payment in the market and the arrangements to

publish the maximum yield rates for acceptance

for Treasury bills and Treasury bond maturities

offered at primary auctions, resulted in continuous

downward momentum in the primary market yield

rates in the second and third quarters of 2020.

However, with the on-set of a second wave of the

COVID-19 pandemic and negative rating actions

towards the latter part of the year, during the

fourth quarter of 2020, reversal of the downward

momentum in the yield rates was observed in both

primary and secondary markets of government

specific credit rating downgrades, net outflows

of foreign investments in the Sri Lankan

government securities market was observed

in 2020. Total net outflow of foreign investments

in Treasury bonds and Treasury bills amounted

to US dollars 552.7 million during the year. The

outstanding foreign holdings of Treasury bonds

and Treasury bills at end 2020 amounted to Rs. 6.7

billion compared to Rs. 103.9 billion at end 2019,

recording a noteworthy decrease.

Among the main focuses of the Government’s

medium-term debt management strategy, the

reduction of the share of foreign debt to total

debt by converting part of the foreign debt

to domestic debt was successful in 2020.

Accordingly, the share of foreign debt reduced

to 42.8 per cent at end December 2020 from

49.1 per cent recorded at end December 2019 and

expected to further reduce to around one third of

the total public debt in the medium-term. However,

outstanding amount of short-term domestic debt

stock partly increased relative to the long-term debt

stock mainly owing to issuances of new Treasury

bills and short-term Treasury bonds to meet the

cash flow requirement of the Government during

the pandemic period. Accordingly, average time to

maturity of outstanding central government domestic

currency debt stock decreased to 4.71 years by end

2020 compared to 5.78 years at end 2019.

As a result of the introduction of maximum

yield rate announcements, along with

accommodative monetary policy stance, raising

domestic currency denominated debt at all time

low yields was possible during 2020, resulting

in a substantive amount of cost savings to the

Government compared to previous years. The

WAYR of Treasury bills and Treasury bonds observed

around 300 basis point reduction in 2020 compared

to 2019. Treasury bonds amounting to Rs. 1,332.1

billion with a WAYR of 7.39 per cent were issued in

2020 compared to Rs. 798.0 billion with a WAYR

of 10.74 per cent in 2019. Moreover, Treasury bills

amounting to Rs 2,590.5 billion were issued in 2020

with an overall WAYR of 5.82 per cent compared

to Rs. 1,719.3 billion with an overall WAYR of

8.92 per cent in 2019.2

Equity Market

The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE)

experienced short-term volatilities throughout

the year due to unprecedented challenges

created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Index-based

circuit breakers were activated on several occasions

due to excessive volatility in the market. The All Share

Price Index (ASPI) on 12 May 2020 recorded its

lowest point in over a decade but recovered recording

a growth of 10.5 per cent by end 2020, the highest

annual increase since 2014. Even though S&P SL20

index showed a similar trend and recovered since

mid-May, it recorded a 10.2 per cent decline during

the year.

The majority of stock market indicators

showed an improvement since mid-May

2020. Market capitalisation increased by

3.8 per cent during 2020 compared to end 2019

and stood at Rs. 2,960.6 billion by end 2020.

2 The overall WAYR includes the total average borrowing cost, including the cost of administratively instructed issuances.

The CSE recorded an extraordinary average daily

turnover during 2020 which amounted to Rs. 3.2

billion compared to Rs. 711.2 million in 2019. This

daily average turnover recorded in 2020 was the

highest recorded for a year since 2011. This was

mainly driven by domestic investors’ preference

shifting towards equity investments due to the

prevailing low interest rate regime and attractive

market valuations. Sri Lanka recorded one of the

lowest Price to Earnings Ratio (PER) among its

regional peers. The PER and Price to Book Value

stood at 11.3 and 1.1, respectively, by end 2020.

However, net foreign outflows continue to

remain a concern. Foreign contribution towards

the total turnover was subpar compared to the

previous year. Only 19.8 per cent of the total

turnover originated from foreign purchases as

against 36.4 per cent reported in the previous

year. The CSE recorded Rs. 51.3 billion foreign

outflows during 2020 compared to an outflow of

Rs. 11.7 billion recorded during 2019.

The Securities and Exchange Commission of

Sri Lanka (SEC), together with CSE, introduced

a number of progressive measures during the

year. Amendments to listing rules, introduction of

three tiered circuit breaker structure, digitalisation

and launch of new products, such as Real Estate

Investment Trusts (REITs), were some of the new

measures implemented towards ensuring the

development and smooth functioning of the market.

Corporate Debt Securities Market

The Commercial Paper (CP) market was

relatively active in 2020 compared to 2019. During

2020, Rs. 4.5 billion was raised through the CPs

issued with the support of licensed banks compared

to Rs. 4.2 billion raised through issues in 2019.

Interest rates of CPs varied in the range from 6.50 to

15.50 per cent during the year compared to a range

of 13.00 to 16.25 per cent reported in the previous

year.

Activities of the corporate bond market were

affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the

temporary closure of the CSE for a period of

seven weeks. During 2020, there were 16 IPOs

of corporate debentures issued by 8 companies in

the CSE which raised Rs. 21.9 billion compared to

Rs. 57.9 billion raised in 2019. Debentures with

fixed interest rates were in the range of 9.00 to

13.25 per cent compared to the range of 12.30 to

15.50 per cent in the previous year.

(MSMEs) during 2020, in addition to the

continuation of several refinance, interest

subsidy and credit guarantee loan schemes.

Extraordinary Measures taken by the Central

Bank to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic: The

Central Bank implemented the Saubagya COVID

-19 Renaissance Facility (SCRF) in three phases,

in order to provide working capital loans at an

interest rate of 4.00 per cent to the borrower with a

repayment period of 24-months, including a grace

period of 6-months to COVID-19 affected MSMEs,

including self-employed individuals.

Under Phase- I of the SCRF, Central Bank

provided refinancing facility to the participating

financial institutions (PFIs) in terms of Section 88

of the MLA. Under Phase – II of the SCRF, Central

Bank provided loans to PFIs against collaterals

approved by the Monetary Board in terms of Section

83 of the MLA. Under Phase - III of the SCRF , PFIs

are expected to use their own funds to grant loans to

the businesses and individuals at 4.00 per cent and

the Central Bank provides credit guarantee ranging

50-80 per cent on loans granted and a 5.00 per cent

per annum interest subsidy for PFIs to cover their

credit risk and cost of funds in terms of the Section

108 of MLA.

The total value of working capital loans (WCLs)

approved by the Central Bank under SCRF stood

at Rs.179.3 billion for 62,573 beneficiaries at the

end December 2020. About 52 per cent of the total

WCLs approved by the Central Bank was provided

to the services sector, while about 33 per cent

and 15 per cent were provided to the SMEs and

individuals in the industry sector and the agriculture

sector, respectively.

Other Measures to Support the MSMEs:

The Central Bank implemented the Supply Chain

Re-Energising Loan Scheme (SCREL), a WCL

scheme for the Tea Sector, in collaboration with

the Ministry of Plantation and Sri Lanka Tea

Board. Further, the Central Bank implemented

a Credit Guarantee Loan Scheme for working

capital requirements for MSMEs affected due to

Easter Sunday Attack in collaboration with the

Ministry of Finance.

The annual interest rates charged on loans

granted under New Comprehensive Rural Credit

Guarantee Scheme (NCRCS) and Saubagya

Loan Scheme were reduced to 4.00 per cent per

annum. The maximum loan amounts granted per

borrower under the Self Employment Promotion

Initiative (SEPI) loan scheme and Swashakthi

Loan Scheme were increased.

Financial Inclusion: The National Financial

Inclusion Strategy (NFIS), developed with

the assistance of the International Finance

Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank Group was

officially launched on 04 March 2021 and the NFIS

Secretariat was also established to coordinate

the financial inclusion efforts in the country.

The six Regional Offices of the Central Bank

were brought under the Regional Development

Department (RDD) in July 2020, with a view to

strengthening the activities of Regional Offices in

line with the financial inclusion objectives of the

Central Bank.

Financial Literacy: The Central Bank

continued to conduct programmes to improve

financial literacy, targeting those who have

been excluded from the formal financial sector.

During 2020, 183 programmes on financial

literacy, entrepreneurship development and skill

development and MSME issues were conducted.

Out of the 183 awareness programmes, six

Regional offices conducted 157 programmes

while RDD conducted 26 programmes including

3 Training of Trainers (TOT) programmes.

The Cheque Clearing System of the country

operated by LankaClear (Pvt.) Ltd (LCPL)

functioned smoothly during 2020. When

compared with 2019, the total volume of cheques

cleared through the Cheque Clearing System

recorded a negative growth of 28.1 per cent and the

total value declined by 24.0 per cent in 2020.

During the year under review, the Sri Lanka

Interbank Payment System (SLIPS), which

mainly facilitates low-value retail bulk payments,

recorded a growth in terms of both the volume

and value of payments by 0.6 per cent and

7.2 per cent, respectively.

Common ATM Switch (CAS), the first phase

of Common Card and Payment Switch (CCAPS),

enables cash withdrawals and balance inquiries

from any ATM connected to the CAS network.

In 2020, the transaction volume and value of CAS

increased by 3.2 per cent to 48.9 million and by

19.2 per cent to Rs. 506.9 billion, respectively. As at

end 2020, 30 financial institutions were integrated to

the CAS network. Shared ATM Switch (SAS) was

launched in 2015 to provide services to financial

institutions, which do not have the capacity to

operate their own card management system had

two members and continued its operations smoothly

during the review period.

Common Electronic Fund Transfer Switch

(CEFTS), another phase of CCAPS, was

launched in 2015 to facilitate retail fund transfers

among member institutions on a real time

basis. The CEFTS transaction volume increased by

86.8 per cent to 27.6 million, while the CEFTS

transaction value grew by 74.7 per cent to

Rs. 2,415.3 billion in 2020. The Central Bank

reduced the CEFTS transaction fee from Rs. 50.00 to

Rs. 30.00 per transaction, and revised the minimum

liability manager limits in CEFTS, thus increasing the

utilisation of excess capacity of electronic payment

systems.

8.6 Financial Infrastructure

Payment and Settlement Systems

The Central Bank continued to ensure

a well-functioning national payment and

settlement system in the country, in order to

cater to the payment needs of the individuals

and institutions and to successfully facilitate

the economic activities of the country. Amidst

the COVID-19 pandemic, the Central Bank ensured

the smooth functioning of the financial system by

effectively mitigating the risks associated with the

national payment and settlement system.

The LankaSettle System, which consists of

the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System,

the country’s only large-value electronic

payment system and the LankaSecure System

functioned effectively and efficiently during

the year under review. Accordingly, value of

the RTGS transactions recorded an increase of

28.1 per cent, when compared with the previous

year. In value terms, the share of RTGS transactions

in total non-cash payments accounted for

90.9 per cent in 2020. The Central Bank continued

to provide the interest free Intra-day Liquidity

Facility (ILF) against the collateral of government

securities to the Participating Institutions (PIs) who

experienced liquidity problems. During the review

period, the daily average of ILF utilised by PIs of

the RTGS System was recorded an average value

of Rs. 66.0 billion. During the year under review, the

maximum per transaction fee of RTGS was reduced

to Rs. 400.00 from Rs. 1,000.00. Simultaneously,

the operator charge levied by the Central Bank as

the operator of RTGS System was reduced from

Rs. 450.00 to Rs. 200.00 per transaction.

At end 2020, total value of scripless

securities held in LankaSecure amounted to

Rs. 7,340.9 billion (Face Value). This consisted

of Treasury bills of Rs. 1,621.4 billion and Treasury

bonds of Rs. 5,719.5 billion.

Introduction

During 2020, COVID-19 created an unprecedented change in the lifestyles of people around the world. Demand for traditional goods and services changed significantly with demand for Information Technology related services increasing rapidly. The adoption of these new changes has led to the creation of new markets and opportunities, which have both positive and negative impacts. Two such key issues, which have garnered attention among both organisations and the general public, in the current situation, are cybersecurity and cybercrime.1

New Information Technology-based Economic Activities

Mobility restrictions adopted by countries due to the pandemic had led to the emergence of several new trends in the carrying out of conventional economic activities. Some of the key trends, which are mostly dependent on information technology and related services, are listed below.

a) Work from Home (WFH)

During the first wave of the pandemic, most countries did not have significant prior experience or did not possess the readiness to face the novel circumstances arising from the pandemic. In order to curb the spread of the virus, the immediate response across countries was to impose varying degrees of mobility restrictions. The urgent manner in which these were undertaken necessitated the urgent transition of workers from physical places of work to ‘work-from-home’ arrangements. Neither workers nor organisations were equipped with the appropriate infrastructure for such working arrangements. This dearth was observed not only in terms of equipment, such as laptops, but also in terms of secure access to organisational systems and networks. In addition to the increased use of email and the internet, many organisations immediately adopted the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPN) for this purpose. Further, personal electronic devices were also being used for official work on a large scale within a very short period. Most of these personal devices were not secured adequately in line with industry accepted standards.

BOX 9Implications of the COVID-19 on Technology Adoption and Cybersecurity

b) Online learning

Educational institutions experienced intermittent closures. Accordingly, all educational activities were shifted to online platforms with teaching staff delivering lessons through platforms, such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams. Assignments and other coursework were also shared through these platforms and others, such as WhatsApp, in order to improve the extent of outreach to students. Even pre-school children started having online learning sessions of 30 minutes to 1 hour. This provided the students the opportunity to use internet enabled mobile devices for longer durations than earlier without much restriction or supervision of their parents.

c) E-commerce

Many merchants who relied on conventional sales through physical outlets rapidly adopted online sales platforms. At the same time, customers also rapidly shifted to online shopping due to lockdowns and travel restrictions imposed to prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19. However, such a swift and widespread transition of sellers and customers to online platforms could not be handled by existing systems leading to system downtimes and interruptions. There was also a reduction in the usage of physical money, in light of the pandemic, thereby leading to a surge in online transactions.

d) Online financial services

Most banks and financial institutions (FI) encouraged their customers to use online financial services to minimise their visits to bank branches. This resulted in increased usage of online banking websites and mobile banking applications. People who possessed low levels of IT literacy also had to use these online financial services for their daily needs, and FIs had to relax some restrictions to widen the reach of these financial services.

e) Virtual meetings and conferences due to travel restrictions

With the pandemic induced travel restrictions and social distancing recommendations, many organisations had to shift in-person meetings and conferences to virtual platforms to ensure continuity, increased accessibility and inclusion. Although online meetings were not an entirely novel concept, it was a relative new experience for a substantial segment of workers. As different organisations used different tools for this purpose, it posed several challenges to data security. A wide range of confidential information including intellectual property and trade secrets had to be shared online and most meeting hosts and participants were not aware of security measures which were essential to preserve the confidentiality of meeting proceedings.

1 Cyber security is the application of technologies, processes and controls to protect systems, networks, programs, devices and data from attack, damage, or unauthorised access. Cybercrime is any criminal activity that involves a computer, networked device or a network. While most cybercrimes are carried out in order to generate profit for the cybercriminals, some cybercrimes are carried out against computers or devices directly to damage or disable them, while others use computers or networks to spread malware, illegal information, images or other materials.

Cyber Criminal Activities amidst Pandemic-Induced Online Activity

a) Phishing emails

Work-from-home arrangements have provided several opportunities for cyber criminals to launch different types of cyber-attacks. Such attacks began with phishing or spam emails, which lure email users to disclose sensitive and confidential information to an unknown third party without their knowledge. Phishing emails have been created targeting a specific group of people or organisations. The sophistication of such phishing emails has increased to the extent that they can surpass spam filters. Through the collection of confidential information from these phishing mails, they were able to plan and execute cyber-attacks to business-critical systems and gain financial benefits.

b) Device sharing and free/cracked software

Many students have to use their parents’ devices for their studies and cyber attackers have launched specific attacks targeting these students. Children tend to visit malicious websites, download and install free software and games to these devices. Such freeware come with malware used for different purposes, such as stealing information, key logging2 and acting as bots3 that initiate cyber-attacks on other devices connected to the internet.

c) Fake websites/apps

The boom of e-commerce has made it easy for cyber criminals to steal customers’ sensitive data, such as credit card details by sending spam emails and setting up fake websites or mobile apps pretending to be an online store, banking website etc. Some organised criminals steal sensitive data from victims and create online banking profiles for accounts that belong to the victims and steal money from these accounts.

d) Loss of information security focus

With the sudden increase in demand for work-from-home arrangements, remote access and other needs, many organisations have lost focus on information security amidst trying to cope up with this surge in demand. When information security professionals also work from home and their focus is also diverted towards these new challenges, general work related to cybersecurity (system updates, patch management, log monitoring, and forensic investigation of security incidents) go unattended paving way for circumstances that provide a good opportunity for the cyber-attackers.

Way Forward

The pandemic could prevail for a while, but the implications of the pandemic would linger on for several years to come. Therefore, it is vital for organisations to have short-term, medium-term and long-term plans to progress in line with the new norms and enhance cybersecurity and cyber resilience.

a) Strengthen cyber resilience

Sophistication of cybercrimes is continuously on the rise and even organisations that have adopted very high levels of cybersecurity measures have not been able to assure that they are fully secured against cyber-attacks. It is believed that some malware can stay undetected in an organisation’s network for very long periods, as much as 240 days before an actual attack. Therefore, most organisations tend to concentrate on achieving cyber resilience, which ensures that the organisation could resume its normal operations with minimal disturbances subsequent to any cyber-attack related disruptions to IT systems. Developments in the IT infrastructure industry, including cloud computing, have enabled businesses to achieve the required business resilience.

b) Business Continuity Planning (BCP) for pandemic-related circumstances

It is mandatory for many industries, including the financial sector, to plan, test and implement business continuity programmes. Many of these BCPs cover test scenarios, such as natural or man-made disasters, technical failures, etc. However, it was observed that pandemic related BCPs had not been implemented or tested in many organisations. A pandemic is a special scenario where physical accessibility to information systems is not possible due to lockdowns and thereby the potential unavailability of key personnel. Organisations may not have enough information security professionals to duplicate or share roles. If these employees are affected by these unusual circumstances, it would create a vacuum in that particular area of work. Therefore, it has become essential for organisations to include remote working arrangements and adequate human resources in their business continuity planning.

c) Allocate adequate budget

With the new norms of work-from-home, it has been extremely difficult for organisations to protect their information systems as done in the past through restricted access and other stringent controls. While allowing these new facilities, organisations should implement immediate and long-term plans to protect their IT assets. Cybersecurity comes with an enormous cost that even large-scale organisations struggle with when deciding on budget allocations for information security. Cooperation among organisations, within a specific sector, to share information security related resources would be beneficial for all in the long term. In

In order to facilitate online payments to

governmental institutions, LankaPay Online

Payment Platform (LPOPP) was launched in

2017. LPOPP currently facilitates online real time

payments to three government Institutions and

during the year under review, 85,010 transactions

with an aggregate value of Rs. 66.9 billion were

processed through LPOPP.

The Central Bank initiated the National

Quick Response (QR) Code Standard for local

currency payments, branded as “LANKAQR”

in 2018. During the year under review, the total

volume and value of LANKAQR transactions

amounted to 159,218 and Rs. 539.2 million

respectively. As at end 2020, there were 169,214

registered LANKAQR merchants. The Central Bank

together with financial institutions with LANKAQR

enabled mobile payment apps launched “rg mqrdu

LANKAQR” public awareness campaign during the

year under review.

the short term, organisations should increase their focus on maximising the usage of available cybersecurity resources to protect their IT assets.

d) User awareness

User awareness can be considered as the most important part of cybersecurity, as it is the users who create system vulnerabilities that pave way for the entry of cyber criminals to enter into the organisational systems. The demarcation between official and personal tasks seems to have disintegrated as observed in the use of personal devices for official work and vice versa. Hence, this too, is a risk to cybersecurity if such devices are not maintained properly with the required security features. Users are often unaware of these risks. This puts the onus of awareness on cybersecurity and staying safe on all individuals. Organisations must focus more on creating user awareness among employees. Schools and universities should also do the same.

e) Working closely with National Computer Incident Response Teams (CIRT)

Most of the countries have established National Computer Incident Response Teams (CIRT) that serve as the national focus point for coordinating cybersecurity incident responses to cyber-attacks within a country.

Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team Coordination Centre (Sri Lanka CERT) is the national CIRT for Sri Lanka and their mission is to protect Information Technology users in the public and private sector organisations and the general public by providing up-to-date information on potential threats and vulnerabilities and by undertaking computer emergency response handling services. Therefore, any individual or organisation can obtain their services and consultancy in relation to cybersecurity when required.

Conclusion

Cybersecurity should be made a topic of the boardroom and given extra attention considering the growing threats during the pandemic. While going through the second wave of the pandemic and with concerns of a possible third wave, every organisation should implement preventive measures for cyber-attacks while strengthening cyber-attack detection, response and recovery capabilities. It is the responsibility of every individual and management to protect themselves and their workplaces from cybercrimes in today’s connected world. At the same time, a collective approach is required at organisational, sectoral, national and international levels to fight against cybercrimes and build a safer world for the present and future generations.

The Central Bank continued its regulatory

and supervisory activities with regard to

payment cards and mobile payment systems,

in terms of the provisions of the Payment Cards

and Mobile Payment Systems Regulations

No. 1 of 2013 (Regulations). Accordingly, two

financial institutions were granted licence under

the National Card Scheme, while another financial

institution was granted a licence to function as a

financial acquirer of payment cards, in terms of

the Regulations during the year 2020. Further,

on-site and off-site supervisions were carried out

by monitoring compliance with the regulations

imposed to Service Providers of Mobile Payment

Systems to ensure smooth functioning of the

mobile phone based e-money systems.

The Central Bank took several measures

to fulfil the payment needs of the general

Act, No. 6 of 2006 (FTRA), the FIU performed its

key role of receiving, analysing and disseminating

of information on suspicious financial transactions

relating to Money Laundering (ML)/Terrorist

Financing (TF) or any other unlawful activity. During

the year 2020, the FIU received 3,665 Suspicious

Transaction Reports (STRs) from reporting

institutions (RIs), law enforcement agencies (LEAs),

regulatory authorities (RAs) and general public.

Upon analysis of the information received through

STRs together with other relevant information

obtained from various sources, during the year,

2,825 STRs were referred, where necessary, to

relevant LEAs and RAs for further investigation or

regulatory actions. Further, in terms of Section 6

of the FTRA, the FIU continued to receive Cash

Transactions Reports (CTRs) and Electronic Fund

Transfers (EFTs-inwards and outwards) exceeding

the reporting threshold of Rs. 1.0 million or its

equivalent in any foreign currency from the RIs.

Accordingly, 4.6 million CTRs and 7.3 million EFTs

were reported to the FIU during the year.

registration facilities and facilitating Know-Your-

Customer requirements digitally to all Licensed

temporarily increasing the limits imposed on

several payment solutions to cater for the increased

demand in online transactions.

The Central Bank announced the year 2020

as the “Year of Digital Transactions” and

carried out number of programmes to increase

customer awareness on digital payment

mechanisms during the year.

The FinTech Regulatory Sandbox, launched

in 2020, received several applications from

innovators during 2020 to test their products

and services without infringing the regulatory

requirements. The Central Bank took several

measures for the deployment and testing of

the Proof Of Concept (POC) for the Blockchain

Technology based Shared KYC facility, while the

National Payments Council (NPC), the industry

consultative and monitoring committee on payment

and settlement systems, appointed two working

In order to ensure institutional compliance

with the AML/CFT requirements set out in the

FTRA, Financial Institutions (Customer Due

Diligence) Rules, No. 1 of 2016 (CDD Rules)

and regulations issued under the FTRA, the

FIU continued to conduct risk-based on-site

examinations on Financial Institutions (FIs)

and Designated Non-Finance Businesses and

Professions (DNFBPs) during the year 2020. The

FIU conducted 11 risk-based on-site examinations,

7 follow-up examinations and 16 on-site spot

examinations on FIs, including joint examinations

with sector specific regulators. Further, 11 risk-based

on-site examinations and 7 follow-up examinations

were conducted on high risk DNFBPs, i.e. real

estate agents and gem and jewellery dealers. Based

on the examinations conducted in 2020, penalties

amounting to Rs. 2.3 million in total were imposed

on 3 FIs for the violations of CDD Rules in relation to

United Nations Security Council sanctions screening.

Also, 14 letters informing the identified deficiencies

and 8 show cause letters were issued to FIs on

non-compliances with the provisions of the FTRA and

the CDD Rules and regulations issued thereunder.

The FIU also issued letters to 15 DNFBPs informing

the identified deficiencies. Further, an interim offsite

ML/TF risk assessment was conducted on DNFBPs

during July 2020 to identify the impact on their

business operations due to COVID-19 pandemic.

The FIU initiated various steps to enhance

the awareness among all stakeholder involved.

In order to strengthen the AML/ CFT supervision

process and institutional compliance, the FIU

issued several guidelines and circulars as well as

conducted awareness programmes during the year

2020. In order to further strengthen the LEAs’ effort

in combating ML related to illicit drug trade, the FIU

conducted awareness sessions for investigators and

FIs, including their senior management and Boards

of Directors. The FIU entered into a Memorandum

of Understanding (MOU) with the Chief of National

Intelligence to exchange intelligence related to the

offences of ML/TF and related crimes, thereby

increasing the total number of MOUs signed with

domestic agencies by the FIU to 12 by end 2020.

In May 2020, the European Commission (EC)

de-listed Sri Lanka from its list of High Risk

Third Countries that have strategic deficiencies

in their AML/CFT regimes. Sri Lanka was listed as

a High Risk Third Country by the EC in February

2018, subsequent to Sri Lanka being identified

by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as a

jurisdiction with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies in

its Compliance Document a.k.a “the Grey List” in

October 2017. Subsequent to the de-listing by the

FATF, the EC de-listed Sri Lanka from its list of High

Risk Third Countries in May 2020. It is expected that

the de-listing by the FATF and EC will negate the

adverse consequences that prevailed during the

previous years and further strengthen the positive

economic outlook and financial integrity of the

country.

Legal Reforms related to the Financial Sector

The Central Bank continued to introduce

law reforms to major legislations administered

by the Central Bank such as the Banking Act,

Finance Business Act and the Registered Stock

and Securities Ordinance, with the objective of

strengthening and enhancing the regulatory and

supervisory powers vested therein, in 2020. The

new Banking Act would provide for a stronger legal

foundation for regulation and supervision of licensed

banks, enhanced governance requirements and an

effective resolution regime for licensed banks while

the amendments introduced to the Finance Business

Act would augment the regulatory and supervisory

powers on non-bank financial institutions. In

addition, the Central Bank was engaged in drafting

amendments to the Registered Stock and Securities

Ordinance and the Finance Leasing Act. Further,

during the year under review, multiple initiatives

have been taken by the Central Bank under the

capital market development project which aimed at

introducing new laws on Netting and Clearing and

insolvency, establishment of central counterparty

and electronic trading platform for securities trading,

which entailed significant changes to be made to the

existing legal framework applicable for the capital

market.

Financial Consumer Protection

With the objective of strengthening the

financial consumer protection framework in

Sri Lanka within the entities regulated by the

Central Bank, Financial Consumer Relations

Department (FCRD) was established in August

2020.

The department is expected to initiate new

measures, which include but not limited to

streamlining the processing of complaints and

grievances, introducing suitable legal provisions

to facilitate financial consumer protection

framework either through new legislations or

by making amendments to existing legislations

and conducting examinations/ investigations

on specific complaints. These measures will

empower authorities to take prompt actions on

financial consumer protection related issues, which

will support to strengthen the financial system

stability.

Since its inception in August 2020, the FCRD

has attended to over 22,000 telephone calls while

the complaints/ grievances received through

faxes, emails and letters during the same

period was over 3,500. Out of the said complaints/

grievances, about 44 per cent were related to LCBs

and LSBs while about 35 per cent were related

to LFCs and SLCs. Further, about 13 per cent of

complaints/grievances received by FCRD were

related to the entities not regulated by the Central

Bank and about 5 per cent of the total complaints

were related to 6 finance companies whose licenses

were suspended or cancelled by the Central Bank.

About 2 per cent of complaints were related to

unauthorised financial institutions operating in

Sri Lanka. The complaints and grievances directed

to FCRD were mainly in the areas of high interest

rates charged for financial facilities, higher penal

interest rate, higher early settlement costs, various

fees and chargers, Credit Information Bureau (CRIB)

related issues, guarantor obligations, non-disclosure

of information to the customer, unauthorised finance

businesses, request for concessions on repayment

of facilities and re-possession of leased vehicles.

Resolution and Enforcement Action on Weak Financial Institutions

The Central Bank continued with both

resolution and enforcement functions while

managing Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance and

Liquidity Support Scheme (SLDILSS) during the

corresponding period. Payment of compensation

to the depositors of the licence cancelled/

suspended finance companies namely, The Finance

Company PLC (TFC), ETI Finance Ltd. (ETIFL) and

Swarnamahal Financial Services PLC (SFSP), was

commenced during 2020 in addition to continuation

of the payment of compensation to the depositors

of three (03) licence cancelled finance companies

namely, Central Investments and Finance PLC

(CIFL), The Standard Credit Finance Ltd. (TSCFL)

and TKS Finance Ltd. (TKSFL) through SLDILSS.

As an extension to the existing compensation

payment procedure, Agency Banking concept was

introduced during the year under review for the

purpose of compensating the insured depositors

through SLDILSS in a timely and efficient manner.

Accordingly, the People’s Bank was appointed as

the Agent Bank for the compensation payments to

the depositors of TFC, ETIFL and SFSP. The Central

Bank has paid compensation through SLDILSS to

66,731 depositors amounting to Rs. 21,114.9 million

in relation to above six (06) companies, as at end

2020.

Enforcement actions were continued with the

cooperation of the Attorney General’s Department

and the Criminal Investigation Department (CID)

of Sri Lanka Police. Upon receiving complaints

from the general public, several investigations

were conducted on prohibited schemes under the

relevant provisions of the Banking Act No.30 of 1988.

Further, actions were taken to coordinate and follow

up the investigations already referred to the Attorney

General’s Department for prosecutions with the

support of Legal and Compliance Department (LCD)

of the Central Bank. Further, several awareness

programmes were conducted island-wide with a

view of improving the financial literacy of different

segments of the general public to educate them on

the ill-effects of joining in various type of prohibited

schemes.

The Central Bank is also in the process of

formulating a resolution framework for banks

and non-bank financial institutions with the

assistance of international consultants, within

the existing regulatory framework in which the

resolution authority and its resolution powers

are specified. Further, arrangements were made for

inclusion of the provisions on resolution procedures

and deposit insurance for banks, in the proposed

new Banking Act.

Regulation and Supervision of Foreign Exchange

The Central Bank continuously engaged

in facilitating foreign exchange operations

during the year. Thus, considering the recent

developments in the domestic foreign exchange

market due to the pandemic, including the

weakening foreign reserves, several measures

were introduced under the provisions of the Foreign

Exchange Act, No. 12 of 2017 (FEA). Accordingly,

Directions were issued to Authorised Dealers (ADs)

limiting release of foreign exchange for certain

current transactions. Further, to support foreign

currency reserve position of the country, an Order

was issued under Section 22 of FEA, restricting

outward remittances of certain capital transactions,

including migrant fund transfers.

Moreover, to attract foreign currency inflows

to the country, Special Deposit Accounts

(SDAs) with an additional interest payment by

the Government were introduced during early

April 2020. With the view of enhancing more SDA

deposits in the form of foreign currency, another

Order was issued under Section 8 of FEA increasing

the foreign currency possession by persons in,

or resident in Sri Lanka up to US dollars 15,000.

Directions were also issued permitting ADs to

recover existing foreign currency loans granted to

foreign exchange earners and to migrant workers,

in Sri Lankan rupees, as a last resort, considering

the difficulties faced by such foreign currency

borrowers. In line with the provisions of FEA, the

Central Bank continuously monitored foreign

exchange transactions.

Activities of Restricted Dealers (RDs) who

are authorised to engage in money changing

business, were continuously monitored to

further develop domestic foreign exchange

market. During the year, RDs have deposited US

dollars 132.71 million to the banking system and

sold US dollars 3.64 million recording a decline of

51 per cent and 83 per cent, respectively, compared

to 2019. Overall, RDs showed declined performance

inter-alia due to subdued economic activities

caused by the pandemic. Actions were also taken

to implement a comprehensive cross border and

foreign currency transactions monitoring system to

collect data from ADs in terms of the Regulations

and Directions issued under FEA, including inflows/

outflows of the domestic foreign exchange market

and whilst to support macroeconomic decision

making on foreign exchange operations.

Credit Information

During 2020, the Credit Information Bureau

(CRIB) issued 8.6 million credit reports to

the industry (out of which 8.3 million were

obtained by lending institutions) recording a

17.0 per cent decrease compared to the previous

year. Demand for the self- inquiry credit reports

(iReports) recorded a 43.0 per cent decrease in

2020, compared to 2019. During the year 2020,

10,724 customers have visited the Bureau to obtain

their iReports and 1,903 customers have applied

their iReports through banks. A total of 225 new

individuals have been registered for the iReport

online service and 1,336 users have accessed their

iReports online in 2020. Mobility restrictions and

bank lending interruptions caused by COVID-19

pandemic may have contributed to this decline.

Several developments were made to improve

the facilities offered by CRIB in 2020. One such

development was the launch of “ONLINE iReport”

service in December 2020, which enables public

to apply and obtain their iReport/CRIB Score

report through the Bureau website. Further, CRIB

issued the necessary data reporting guidelines

to member lending institutions to report data

during the moratorium period, so that the eligible

borrowers in this scheme will not have an impact

on their credit score in the future. CRIB facilitated

all member lending institutions to enable access to

credit information via the new Host-to-Host modality,

starting from June 2020 which enables institutions

to directly connect the core banking system with

the Bureau system. Further, “CRIB Score”, a credit

score, was developed through a partnership with

Creditinfo International GMBH and was officially

launched in January 2020. Further, member

lending institutions are enabled to obtain CRIB

scores for their existing customers in bulk mode,

for risk evaluation purposes. Furthermore, the

“Retrospective CRIB Score Analysis Report”, which

can be used to predict the future, based on the past

behavior of the credit portfolio, was also released to

the member lending institutions in February 2020.

Steps are being taken to reduce the price, changed

for CRIB reports especially for microfinance service

providers and digital lenders.
