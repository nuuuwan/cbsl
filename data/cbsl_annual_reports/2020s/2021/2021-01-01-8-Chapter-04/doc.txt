4.1 OverviewT

he general price level as measured in terms of official consumer price indices, increased at a slow

pace during 2020. This was mainly supported by subdued demand for non-essential goods and

services associated with the lockdowns and containment measures imposed to mitigate the spread

of the COVID-19 pandemic. With a considerable increase at the beginning of the year, prices of items in the

Non-food category, where most of the non-essential goods and services are included, exhibited only marginal

increases during 2020. Moreover, the absence of periodical price revisions of Airfare, Health and Education

had a favourable impact on the behaviour of the general price level in 2020. Meanwhile, the prices of items in

the Food category increased noticeably throughout 2020, even in the presence of administrative price control

measures introduced by the Government to maintain prices at stable levels. Within the Food category, prices

of Volatile food items, which increased at the beginning of the year as a result of supply shortage due to crop

damages, instigated by the prolonged rainy conditions prevailed in the latter part of 2019, displayed mixed

movement during 2020, alongside the prices of other food items, which exhibited an overall increasing trend.

However, the pressure emanating from higher food prices on the general price level was partially moderated

by the marginal increase observed in the prices of the items in the Non-food category, which accounts for a

larger share in the official price indices. Meanwhile, amidst the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,

even though nominal wages increased across the economy, real wages of formal private sector employees,

whose wages are governed by the wage boards and informal private sector employees declined in 2020.

This was the first time that the employees in informal private sector experienced a real wage erosion since

2012. However, real wages of public sector employees increased in 2020 with the introduction of a new

non-pensionable monthly interim allowance of Rs. 2,500, and the addition of the final tranche of the special

allowance and interim allowance to the basic salary.

4.2 Prices

Movements of the General Price Level

In the light of the low demand for non-food

items prevailed in local markets, the general

price level measured by both Consumer Price

Indices (CPIs), namely, the NCPI and CCPI,1

mostly followed the price movement of the items

in the Food category during 2020. Accordingly,

the general price level, which increased in January

2020, moved on a declining trend until April

2020 and increased thereafter. During 2020, the

behaviour of prices of items in the Food category

exhibited mixed movements, while items in the

Non-food category showed modest changes,

signifying the low demand for non-essential goods

and services in the lockdown period. Hence, though

prices of items in the Non-food category showed

an increasing momentum during January to March,

they exhibited broadly a stable behaviour between

April and June 2020. However, they increased

again from July onwards with increases observed

mainly in the sub-categories such as Transport

(Bus fare) and Clothing and Footwear amidst the

decrease observed in the Health sub-category in

August 2020.

Rice, Coconut, Vegetable, Onion and

Potato prices made a considerable impact on

the behaviour of the Volatile Food2 category

throughout 2020. Accordingly, prices of items

in the Volatile Food category, which increased at

the beginning of the year due to crop damages

instigated by the prolonged rainy conditions

prevailed in the latter part of 2019, moved on a

declining trend till May 2020, and followed an

overall increasing trend thereafter. Price increases

of vegetables, coconut and red onion mainly

contributed to the uptick observed in the Volatile

Food category in January 2020. The prices of

Volatile Food, which increased since April 2019,

declined from February to May 2020, in which

price declines of rice, vegetables, onion, large

fish, and green chilli made a substantial impact

on the behaviour of the Volatile Food category

between February and April 2020. Meanwhile, in

May 2020, prices of coconut, fresh fruit, potato

and red onion decreased, whereas increases

were observed in items such as rice, vegetables,

fresh fish, and meat. The increase observed in the

prices of Volatile Food items in June 2020, was

mostly due to price increases in items such as rice,

vegetables, fresh fish, and chicken. However, this

increasing trend reversed in July 2020, attributed

to price decreases in rice, coconut, vegetables,

and onions. Nevertheless, the prices of items in

the Volatile Food category increased afterwards

in 2020, owing to the price increases observed in

rice, vegetables, coconut, big onion, and potato,

while fruit prices also made a substantial impact

on the price increases observed in August and

September 2020. Though the fish prices mostly

behaved as in the recent past, substantial price

declines were observed with the identification

of the COVID-19 cluster of the Peliyagoda fish

fish prices recovered to some extent in December

2020, with the normalisation of trading activities

with the pandemic situation being under control.

Moreover, prices of lime and green chilli also made

a considerable impact on the price level of Volatile

Food items during the year.

In 2020, the Government made a considerable

effort to maintain Volatile Food prices at a stable

level by way of price controls. With a view to

reducing escalating rice prices, the Maximum Retail

Prices (MRPs), which were imposed on 10 April 2020

amounting to Rs. 90 per 1kg each for Samba and

Nadu rice and Rs. 85 per 1kg for Kekulu rice, were

revised upwards to Rs. 98, Rs. 96 and Rs. 93 per 1kg

on Samba, Nadu and Kekulu rice, respectively, with

effect from 28 May 2020. Later, maximum wholesale

prices of Rs. 94, Rs. 92 and Rs. 89 per 1kg were

imposed on Samba, Nadu and Kekulu rice with effect

retail prices of rice at stable levels. However, towards

the latter part of 2020, a supply shortage in Samba

rice was observed even with the receival of the Yala

harvest to the market. Despite, the efforts made

by the Government to keep prices at stable levels,

rice prices continuously increased from September

onwards, remaining above the respective MRPs.

In 2020, prices of coconut made a notable impact

on the behaviour of prices of the Volatile Food

category. During the year, except in May and July

2020, prices of coconut increased, while remaining

above the prices prevailed in the corresponding

period of 2019. As a result, MRPs of Rs. 60,

Rs. 65 and Rs. 70 were imposed on coconut, of

which the circumference is below 12 inches, between

12-13 inches and above 13 inches, respectively, with

effect from 25 September 2020. However, coconut

prices continuously increased afterwards remaining

above the MRPs, highlighting the need to introduce

proper measures to manage the gap between the

demand and supply, which prevails in the domestic

market. During the period from February to April

in 2020, big onion prices remained well above the

prices that prevailed in the corresponding months

since 2014, thereby compelling the Government

to impose MRPs of Rs. 190 and Rs.150 per 1kg,

with effect from 23 February 2020 and 18 March

2020, respectively to protect consumers from

higher prices. Subsequently, reflecting the lower

prices in the international market, big onion prices

followed a declining trend during the period from

April to July 2020. Afterwards, big onion prices

increased mainly due to the decline observed in

domestic production owing to crop damages and

the export ban imposed by India with effect from

15 September 2020. Meanwhile, the Special

Commodity Levy (SCL) on imported big onion

was increased to Rs. 15 and Rs. 50 per 1kg with

effect from 01 May 2020 and 01 August 2020,

respectively. However, the Government revised

the SCL downwards on imported big onion to

25 cents per 1kg with effect from 14 October 2020,

in view of curtailing difficulties that had arisen with

the re-emergence of the pandemic. Moreover, the

availability of varieties with different qualities from

countries like Egypt, Turkey, Pakistan and the

Netherlands also contributed to stabilise the big

onion prices between November and December

of 2020. Furthermore, red onion prices, which

recorded its highest in the recent past at the

beginning of the year, decreased comparatively

between July to September 2020, though the

SCL increased to Rs. 50 per 1kg with effect from

22 May 2020. However, prices of red onion

increased continuously from October onwards.

Remaining above the price levels observed in

previous years, the price of potatoes mostly

followed a similar movement observed in recent

years. Meanwhile, with effect from 22 May 2020

and 15 August 2020, SCL on 1kg of imported

potatoes increased to Rs. 50 and Rs. 55,

respectively. Accordingly, Volatile Food indices

of both CPIs followed an overall increasing trend

during 2020, even though the respective increase is

lower compared to 2019.

Prices of food items excluding Volatile

Food moved on an overall increasing trend in

2020, exerting pressure on the general price

level, despite the Government involvement

to maintain food prices at a stable level.

Intermittent price changes observed in dhal, sugar,

coconut oil, egg, rice flour, milk powder, cereal,

dried fish, canned fish, and turmeric powder

made a notable impact on the price behaviour

of this category. Dhal prices, which increased

substantially towards the end of 2020, remained

high compared to the previous year except in

March and April 2020. MRPs of Rs. 65 per 1kg of

dhal and Rs. 100 per 425g tin of canned fish, which

were imposed with effect from 18 March 2020 as

provisions of relief to the consumers during the

situation prevailed in the country following the

COVID-19 outbreak, were removed from 30 April

2020. Meanwhile, reflecting a partial impact of the

price controls, canned fish prices decreased in

March and April 2020. Imported milk powder prices

remained unchanged throughout 2020, whereas

the price of local milk powder increased from Rs.

345 to Rs. 380 per 400g packet with effect from

28 April 2020 to par with the price of imported milk

powder. Reduction of egg prices to Rs. 10 each

with effect from 23 March 2020 as a relief measure

during the lockdown period resulted in the lowest

egg prices for the year during the period from April

and May 2020. However, from May to August,

egg prices increased continuously, necessitating

the decision to decrease the price per egg by

Rs. 2 with effect from 07 September 2020. As a

result, egg prices decreased from September

to November, though it increased again in

December 2020. In order to maintain chicken

prices at reasonable levels, the Government

imposed MRPs of Rs. 430 and Rs. 500 per 1kg on

broiler chicken (with skin) and chicken (skinless),

respectively, with effect from 12 March 2020. Even

though chicken prices declined accordingly in April

2020, the prices exhibited an increasing trend

afterwards during May to September 2020, while

showing a marginal decline afterwards. Moreover,

the MRP of maize was also brought to Rs. 55

per 1kg, with effect from 12 March 2020, mainly

as a measure to control the increase of chicken

prices. Prices of turmeric powder which exhibited

minor behavioral changes in the past, showed a

continuous increasing momentum in 2020 with a

significant increase between May to August, due to

the restrictions imposed on turmeric powder imports

effective from 06 December 2019 with the objective

of increasing the local production. Although a MRP

of Rs. 750 was imposed on 1kg of turmeric powder

with effect from 21 April 2020, its prices spiked in

the following months owing to the substantial gap

between local supply and demand, resulting in the

Government removing the MRP with effect from

24 September 2020. Meanwhile, the prices of

wheat flour remained stable during 2020, while

prices of rice flour exhibited increasing momentum

from May onwards, reflecting higher rice prices

prevailed in the market. In line with the higher

coconut prices that prevailed in 2020, prices

of coconut oil followed an overall increasing

trend during the year, while remaining higher

compared to previous years. Sugar prices, which

increased during the first half of the year, declined

marginally afterwards. Considering difficulties that

arose with the re-emergence of the COVID-19

pandemic, SCL on several imported items, such

as dhal, canned fish and sugar, was revised

downwards to 25 cents per 1kg with effect from

14 October 2020. Consequently, Other Food

indices of both CPIs showed an increasing trend

during 2020.

In contrast to previous years, in 2020, the

behaviour of prices of items in the Non-food

category remained at a modest level, especially

in the first half of the year, emphasising the lower

demand for non-essential goods and services

that arose with the lock-down conditions

and non-adjustment of administered prices.

However, in January 2020, due to an increase

in house rental prices along with the increase

in tuition fees for secondary education, the

Non-food category exhibited the highest increase

since January 2019. The Health sub-category,

which increased in March due to an increase in

payments to medical laboratories, decreased in

August contributed by the downward price revision

of the Full Blood Count (FBC) laboratory test,

which occured in end of July 2020, and remained

unchanged thereafter in 2020, with a marginal

increase in December. During the year, Ceylon

Petroleum Corporation (CPC) maintained its fuel

prices at a constant level. Meanwhile, Lanka IOC

(LIOC) reduced its petrol (92 octane) price from

Rs. 142 to Rs. 137 per litre from 06 April 2020

but increased it back to the original price on

17 May 2020. However, in the next price revision

on 20 May 2020, LIOC reduced petrol (92 octane)

price back to Rs. 137, matching the price of the

CPC. Further, though the train fares remained

unchanged during the year, with the introduction

of the COVID-19 transport policy, bus fares were

revised from 11 November 2020, considering

the risk level. Accordingly, for the routes, where

loading passengers was allowed only up to the

seating capacity, bus fares were increased by

1.2 times, and for the routes where loading

passengers was allowed only up to 50 per cent

of the seating capacity, bus fares were increased

by 1.5 times of the existing amount. However,

reflecting the border protection controls imposed

with the pandemic situation, airfare remained

unchanged from March 2020 onwards. Likewise,

revision of Education fees, which consists of some

periodical price increases, was not observed during

the year. Meanwhile, no revisions were made to

the prices of utilities such as water, electricity,

and gas, mainly with the objective of providing

relief to both the general public and businesses

who were adversely affected by the lockdown

conditions associated with the pandemic. Further,

communication charges such as, postal, fixed

telephone, mobile telephone, internet and satellite

TV, were also not revised in 2020. Moreover,

prices of arrack, beer and cigarettes remained

unchanged in 2020, while prices of areca nuts

increased from July to September remaining

significantly higher during the second half of 2020

compared to 2019. Accordingly, Non-food indices

of both CPIs exhibited only marginal increases

during 2020.

Consumer Price Indices

National Consumer Price Index

The NCPI, which recorded 137.0 index

points in January, declined to 134.8 index

points in April and gradually increased

thereafter to 141.2 index points in December

2020. The increase observed in the NCPI in

January 2020, before the outbreak of COVID-19,

was driven by the increases observed in prices

of items in both Food and Non-food categories.

Afterwards, the NCPI remained unchanged

in February and declined for two consecutive

months driven by the price decreases in the Food

category. The NCPI demonstrated a reversal

of its previous downward trend and increased

during the period from April to June, where the

prices of items in the Food category remained

the sole contributor towards this momentum.

The NCPI remained unchanged again in July,

as the decline of the prices of items in the Food

category was nullified by the increase observed

in the prices of items in the Non-food category.

Thereafter, NCPI continuously increased for

the remainder of 2020. The increases observed

from August to November were contributed by

the price increases of items in both Food and

Non-food categories with a higher contribution

from the Food category. Meanwhile, increase

in prices of items in the Food category solely

contributed to the increase observed in December

2020 in NCPI.

Colombo Consumer Price Index

The CCPI followed an increasing trend

during 2020 from 134.6 index points in January

to 138.0 index points in December 2020, while

remaining unchanged in February and August.

The increase in January 2020 was supported by

the movement of the prices of items in both Food

and Non-food categories. The CCPI remained

unchanged in February and August, due to the

movement of Food and Non-food categories

setting off each other. Meanwhile, the movement

of prices of items in the Food category solely

contributed towards the decline observed in

March and increases observed thereafter in April

and October 2020. Month-on-month increases

demonstrated by the CCPI in the remaining

months of the year were due to the price increases

of the items in both Food and Non-food categories

with a higher share from the Food category.

a tripartite agreement was reached between the

Ministry of Skills Development, Employment

and Labour Relations,3 the Employers'

Federation of Ceylon and trade unions on paying

50 per cent of the last paid basic salary or

Rs. 14,500 per month, whichever was more

favourable to the employee, where employees

were required to stay at home due to pandemic

conditions. However, nominal wages of employees

in the formal private sector, as measured by the

annual average change in the minimum wage rate

index (1978 December=100) of employees whose

wages are governed by the wage boards, increased

by 0.2 per cent in 2020 compared to 2019. This

increase was mainly driven by the increases

in minimum wages of workers in the industry

and commerce, and services sub-categories.

Nevertheless, real wages of employees in the

formal private sector decreased by 4.2 per cent in

2020 compared to 2019.

Amidst the containment measures taken to

curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the

informal private sector was severely affected

Producer's Price Index (PPI)

The PPI (2013 Q4=100) as measured by

the average prices received by domestic

producers of goods, which is compiled by the

DCS, exhibited an overall increasing trend

during 2020 from 144.3 index points in January

to 149.2 index points in December 2020. PPI

covers the Producer’s prices of Agriculture,

Manufacturing, and Utilities (Electricity and

Water Supply) sectors of the economy. The PPI

in the Agriculture sub-index, which recorded

169.8 index points in January, declined in the next

three months and gradually increased thereafter

to 184.7 index points in June 2020 and recorded

185.1 index points in December 2020. Meanwhile,

the PPI in the Manufacturing sub-index reported

133.7 in January and reached 139.9 index

points in December 2020, yet recording notable

fluctuations in between. The PPI in the Electricity

and Water Supply sub-index, which recorded

86.7 index points in January, increased up

to March and followed a decreasing trend

during April to May and increased thereafter to

92.3 index points in December 2020.

In the midst of the adverse impact of the

COVID-19 pandemic, real wages of the employees

in the formal and informal private sectors showed

an erosion whereas the real wages of the public

sector employees showed an increase in 2020

compared to the previous year. Nevertheless, the

demand pressure arising from wages on the general

price level remained subdued during the year.

Private Sector Wages

The formal private sector was adversely

affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly,

some firms had to revise salaries downwards as

with the disruptions to their capacity to earn a

first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and gradually

recovered until September 2020. Thereafter, with the

second wave of the pandemic, it decreased again

in October 2020 and recovered in November and

December 2020. Overall, nominal wages of informal

private sector employees, as measured by the annual

average change in the informal private sector wage

rate index (2012=100), increased by 3.3 per cent in

2020 compared to 2019. Meanwhile, real wages of

Nominal wages of the public sector

employees, as measured by the annual average

change in the public sector wage rate index

and the final tranche of the special allowance and

interim allowance to the basic salary, with effect from

01 January 2020. Accordingly, real wages of the
