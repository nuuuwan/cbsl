The International Labour Organization (2019) reported that about 90 per cent of all enterprises in many countries consist of MSMEs, accounting for 70 per cent of employment globally. As per the economic census conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) in 2013/14 on non-agricultural economic activities,1 about 99 per cent of non-agricultural establishments in Sri Lanka were found to be MSMEs, while the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (2016) estimated that about 45 per cent of employment in the country is in the MSME sector.",

The main objective of the \u2018SME Credit Survey\u2019 is to identify the average cost of credit granted to MSMEs3 by licensed commercial banks (LCBs) and licensed specialised banks (LSBs).

However, in a broad sense, compared to regional peers, such as the Republic of Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, whose economic progress in recent years has surpassed that of Sri Lanka, lending to the MSME sector of Sri Lanka by the formal banking sector remains comparatively weak. The share of credit granted to the MSME sector in Sri Lanka remains low,7 while the spread between average interest rates on loans granted to MSMEs, especially on small sized loans, and average interest rates on loans granted to prime customers remains high. Relatively high interest rate spreads may reflect a multitude of contributing factors, such as the level of financial market development, poor financial literacy of MSMEs, and their approach to banking practices. The importance of promoting the MSME sector could be observed through the success experienced by the Republic of Korea, where the share of manufacturing value added of MSMEs remained over 49 per cent in 2014,8 despite being home to some of the largest corporations in the world, such as Samsung, LG, and Hyundai.",
