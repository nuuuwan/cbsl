7.1 OverviewI

n view of the COVID-19 pandemic that posed significant challenges for businesses and individuals, the

Central Bank initiated several measures to relax monetary conditions to unprecedented levels, within

a growth, recovery and stability focused monetary policy stance in 2020. Extraordinary monetary

accommodation aimed at facilitating domestic investment to take off was made possible by headline and

core inflation remaining at low levels, in the context of well anchored inflation expectations and subdued

aggregate demand, as well as the restrictions that were imposed on non-essential imports and outward

investment. In 2020, the policy interest rates were reduced five times by a total of 250 basis points, the

Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) applicable on all rupee deposit liabilities of licensed commercial banks

(LCBs) was reduced on two occasions by a total of 3 percentage points, and the Bank Rate was reduced

by 650 basis points, alongside other key policy changes. The Central Bank provided required funding for

the Government throughout the year, which also contributed to enhancing market liquidity. Further, the

Central Bank implemented highly concessional loan schemes for working capital purposes for businesses

affected by the pandemic and also initiated direct measures to reduce certain lending rates, which were

considered excessive, while imposing maximum interest rates on mortgage-backed housing loans. As a

combined result of these measures, the overall interest rate structure of the economy adjusted downwards,

with certain market interest rates reaching historical lows. As a result of these developments, a revival in

the overall expansion of credit to the private sector was observed towards the latter part of 2020, while

credit to the public sector increased substantially during the year, resulting in a rapid expansion of broad

money supply.

7.2 Monetary Policy Stance of the

Central Bank of Sri Lanka

The Central Bank followed an accommodative

monetary policy stance throughout 2020,

focusing on growth, recovery and stability,

given muted inflation and well anchored

inflation expectations. The COVID-19 outbreak

and the resultant containment measures contracted

economic activity, requiring the Central Bank to

maintain an extremely accommodative monetary

policy stance to support the recovery of the

economy. Accordingly, the monetary easing

cycle, which commenced in May 2019, continued

through 2020 with a significant reduction in policy

interest rates and the Statutory Reserve Ratio

(SRR) applicable on all rupee deposit liabilities of

licensed commercial banks (LCBs). The Central

Bank reduced the policy interest rates by a total

of 250 basis points and the SRR by a total of

3 percentage points in 2020. In January 2020,

the Central Bank reduced its policy interest rates,

namely, the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR)

and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR), by

50 basis points to 6.50 per cent and 7.50 per cent,

respectively. Following the outbreak of COVID-19

in the country from March 2020, the Central Bank

acted promptly to maintain confidence in the market

by way of a series of measures aimed at reducing

the cost of funds further, increasing liquidity in

the domestic money market and signalling the

commitment to maintaining an accommodative

policy stance in the period ahead. Accordingly,

the Central Bank reduced policy rates further by a

total of 100 basis points in three monetary policy

reviews between March and May 2020. Moreover,

to increase liquidity in the money market amidst

heightened uncertainty emanating from cashflow

disruptions and emergency funding requirements

of financial institutions, the Central Bank reduced

the SRR by 1 percentage point in March 2020, and

again by 2 percentage points in June 2020, thereby

releasing about Rs. 180 billion of additional liquidity.

Further, the Central Bank introduced concessional

credit schemes under the Saubagya COVID-19

Renaissance Facility enabling licensed banks to

grant working capital loans at low interest rates

to businesses affected by the pandemic. Despite

the reduction in the policy interest rates and the

SRR by mid-2020, the adjustment in lending rates

remained sluggish. Hence, in July 2020, the Central

Bank further reduced its policy rates, i.e., the SDFR

and the SLFR, by 100 basis points each, to their

lowest levels of 4.50 per cent and 5.50 per cent,

respectively. Meanwhile, in order to signal the

availability of emergency funding for the financial

sector at an affordable cost, the Central Bank

reduced the Bank Rate by 500 basis points in

April 2020, while allowing it to be determined

automatically with a margin of 300 basis

points above the SLFR. Accordingly, the Bank

Rate declined by a total of 650 basis points to

8.50 per cent by end 2020. The Central Bank

implemented further regulatory measures in

August 2020 to reduce excessive interest rates

charged on credit cards, pawning, pre-arranged

temporary overdrafts as well as penal interest

rates, thereby quickening the monetary policy

transmission process and helping marginal

borrowers. Overall, measures to ease monetary

policy and monetary conditions were aimed

at promoting domestic investment, which had

remained subdued for a prolonged period, as well

as supporting the pandemic-affected economy to

revert to a higher growth path early. Considering

the setbacks to the government cashflows due to

the pandemic, the Central Bank provided financial

support to the Government by way of purchasing

Treasury bills from the primary market. This helped

increase market liquidity, and lower yields on

government securities, which was also supported

by the imposition of maximum yield rates for

acceptance at primary auctions, thus reducing the

Government’s financing cost substantially during

this period. However, the notable increase in the

government securities holdings of the Central

Bank reflects the likelihood of a buildup of future

inflationary pressures, and therefore necessitates

the timely rollback of monetary stimuli, once

aggregate demand conditions normalise on a

sustainable basis. Meanwhile, the Central Bank

implemented further measures to revive economic

activity following the second wave of COVID-19 in

the country. Accordingly, the Central Bank

introduced a maximum interest rate of 7 per cent

per annum on mortgage-backed housing loans

for a tenure of at least five years for salaried

employees. Reflecting the impact of policy and

regulatory measures, market lending rates

declined notably during the year. With the reduction

in lending rates and improved market sentiments,

credit to the private sector rebounded since

August 2020. However, as most of such credit

was in the form of personal loans and advances,

the Central Bank initiated further measures to

support the needy sectors of the economy by

announcing priority sector lending targets for

banks on the micro, small and medium scale

enterprises (MSME) sector in January 2021.

The unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on economies and financial markets prompted central banks across the globe to take extraordinary measures to address the financial distress created by the pandemic and support their economies. In addition to traditional monetary policy tools, many central banks deployed unconventional monetary policies, including quantitative easing, targeted credit programmes, and forward guidance to maintain low interest rates.

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka also deployed an array of monetary policy tools in 2020, while being one of the first central banks in the world to ease monetary policy citing the outbreak of COVID-19. These policies, including unconventional measures, were executed at an extraordinary pace, size, and scope, aimed at injecting sufficient liquidity into the market and lowering borrowing costs, thus supporting financial markets and the recovery

BOX 5Monetary Policy Tools deployed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka during 2020

of economic activity. Subdued demand and inflationary conditions provided the necessary policy space for the undertaking of such extensive monetary policy stimulus. These monetary policy measures were complemented by the fiscal stimuli provided by the Government and a multitude of other regulatory and operational actions taken by the Central Bank.

Given the need to ensure a rapid recovery in economic activity, the return to a high growth path after a prolonged period of subdued growth, and to support macroeconomic and financial system stability, the Central Bank reduced its policy interest rates substantially by 2.50 percentage points during 2020, with a view to enhancing credit flows by lowering real interest rates, which in turn would support domestic investment, production and consumption in the economy. Further, the Central Bank lowered the Bank Rate by 6.50 percentage points during the year to signal the

availability of emergency funding for the financial sector at an affordable cost.

To enhance liquidity in the domestic money market and help financial institutions, businesses, and individuals, that were in distress due to disruptions to cashflows, the Central Bank lowered the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) by a total of 3 percentage points, thereby directly injecting liquidity of around Rs. 180 billion to the market immediately, in 2020.

Open Market Operations (OMO) conducted by the Central Bank guided short term interest rates to remain at low levels while maintaining sufficient liquidity in the money market. Further, the Central Bank provided urgent financial assistance to the Government, in order to support businesses and individuals affected by the pandemic, by purchasing Treasury bills from the primary market, totaling around Rs. 625 billion, on a net basis, during the year. This also helped improve liquidity in the domestic money market and helped reduce yields on government securities by around 2-3 percentage points.

Concessional loan schemes were implemented by the Central Bank (under the Saubagya COVID-19 Renaissance Facility) to provide funding to meet working capital requirements of businesses affected by the pandemic. Total funds provided by the Central Bank under these schemes amounted to around Rs. 180 billion, at a concessional rate of 4 per cent, thereby providing direct relief to businesses, particularly to Micro, Small and Medium scale Enterprises (MSMEs), to continue operating through times of great difficulty.

The Central Bank continued to use moral suasion during 2020 to persuade commercial banks to reduce market interest rates in line with the monetary policy expectations and also influence banks to provide essential liquidity

support to pandemic-affected entities, by maintaining constant dialogue with banks. Policy measures that were implemented in consultation with the banking community since 2019 to provide relief to economic activities following the Easter Sunday attacks and to ensure a sustained reduction in market lending rates also contributed to the effectiveness of this endeavour.

Forward guidance was also used as a tool by the Central Bank to convince the stakeholders of the economy that the prevailing accommodative monetary policy stance would be maintained until the economy shows strong signs of recovery. Such guidance was instrumental in dispelling adverse speculation on the possible rise in interest rates in the near future. Further, it helped maintain the momentum of declining market interest rates, while supporting the cause of ensuring a single digit interest rate structure in the medium to long term, thereby passing the benefit of the sustained low inflation environment to domestic investors.

The Central Bank also adopted targeted measures by imposing maximum interest rates on certain financial products with excessive interest rates, thereby improving the monetary policy transmission mechanism as well. Further, measures were taken to introduce priority sector lending targets for licensed banks on MSMEs.

The series of monetary policy tools deployed by the Central Bank throughout 2020 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic greatly facilitated the maintenance of financial system stability under extremely challenging circumstances. Supported by such extraordinary monetary accommodation, along with the fiscal stimulus measures, the economy has already shown signs of steady recovery, and it is expected that the current low interest rate environment will help the economy to revert to a high growth path, alongside the implementation of reforms required for such growth.

Moreover, the Central Bank provided forward

guidance to the market on the maintenance of

accommodative monetary policy through 2021,

thereby dispelling speculation of rising interest

rates in the near term. The maintenance of the

low interest rate structure was also supported

by the prevailing restrictions on non-essential

imports and other foreign exchange outflows.

The conduct of monetary policy in 2020

focused more on reviving economic activity in

the near term as inflation remained subdued,

reflecting the impact of the pandemic on aggregate

demand. The Central Bank conducted monetary

policy under its flexible inflation targeting (FIT)

framework with the objective of maintaining

inflation within the target range of 4-6 per cent in

the medium term with due regard to aggregate

demand conditions.

The Central Bank strengthened its

communication through various platforms

during the pandemic in order to disseminate

information on policy actions and provide

assurance to stakeholders on the Central

Bank’s readiness to support the revival of the

economy, while improving the transmission

of monetary easing measures adopted during

2020. With the strict social distancing measures

that were put in place, the Central Bank moved

towards virtual communication modes during

MONETARY POLICY, INTEREST RATES, MONEY AND CREDIT

the year. Accordingly, monetary policy press

conferences were conducted online while

livestreaming the same on social media. Further,

the Central Bank used social media networks to

communicate monetary policy related information,

among others. Meanwhile, the Roadmap: Monetary

and Financial Sector Policies for 2021 and

Beyond, was announced online by the Governor

of the Central Bank at the beginning of 2021 to

apprise the market on broad-based strategies

on macroeconomic policies in the period ahead.

The Central Bank announced the forthcoming

publication of the ‘Monetary Policy Report’ (MPR)

commencing 2021, with a more forward-looking

focus on the economy, in addition to actual

realisations. Moving towards publishing the MPR,

the Central Bank commenced incorporating

medium term projections on inflation into the

monetary policy review press releases in 2020 to

help guide inflation expectations of stakeholders.

Meanwhile, information on macroeconomic

developments was regularly published in the

publications of the Central Bank, including

the Annual Report and the Recent Economic

Developments Report, in all three languages,

without delay, amidst challenges encountered due

to COVID-19. In addition, key macroeconomic

statistics were published on the Central Bank

website in daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly

frequencies.

Subdued demand pressures, along with well

anchored inflation expectations and administered

price revisions helped maintain inflation at

relatively low levels during 2020. As measured by

the year-on-year change in the Colombo Consumer

Price Index (CCPI, 2013=100), headline inflation

broadly remained within the targeted range of

4-6 per cent. Similarly, National Consumer Price

Index (NCPI, 2013=100) based headline inflation,

which registered an uptick at the beginning of

the year, gradually subsided towards the end of

the year. Headline inflation, as measured by the

year-on-year change in the CCPI, peaked at

6.2 per cent in February 2020, mainly driven by high

food inflation owing to adverse weather conditions.

This gradually subsided along with the moderation

of food and non-food inflation and recorded

4.2 per cent at the end of the year. Supply side

disruptions exerted upward pressures on food

inflation during the most part of 2020. On an annual

average basis, CCPI based headline inflation

was marginally higher at 4.6 per cent at end 2020,

compared to 4.3 per cent recorded at end 2019.

Year-on-year headline inflation based on the NCPI,

which followed a similar pattern to that of CCPI

based headline inflation, peaked at 8.1 per cent

in February 2020 before gradually decelerating to

4.6 per cent by December 2020. NCPI based

headline inflation remained high, compared to CCPI

based headline inflation, due to the larger weight

of the food category in the NCPI basket. Annual

average NCPI based headline inflation accelerated

to 6.2 per cent in December 2020, compared to

3.5 per cent at end 2019, largely due to persistently

high food inflation.

Core inflation, which reflects the underlying

trend in inflation and hence more useful for

monetary policy purposes, remained at low

levels throughout 2020 reflecting subdued

demand conditions. Downward adjustments to

prices due to the reduction in Value Added Tax

and the removal of Nation Building Tax, alongside

the decline in prices of telecommunication

and data services with the reduction of the

Telecommunication Levy effective December

2019, eased the increase in the core inflation

index at the beginning of the year. These

factors, along with the favourable statistical

base effect contributed to the deceleration

in core inflation during 2020. Accordingly,

year-on-year core inflation based on the CCPI

reached 3.5 per cent at end 2020, compared to

4.8 per cent recorded at end 2019. Annual average

core inflation also remained at a low level of

3.1 per cent in December 2020, in comparison

to 5.5 per cent at end 2019. Following a similar

trend, year-on-year core inflation based on the

NCPI decelerated from 5.2 per cent at end 2019 to

4.7 per cent by end 2020. However, the statistical

base effect contributed to an increase in NCPI

based year-on-year core inflation in mid-2020.

Annual average core inflation based on the NCPI

also decelerated to 4.1 per cent, year-on-year, by

end 2020 from 5.7 per cent recorded at end 2019.

As reflected in the Inflation Expectations

Survey of the Central Bank, inflation expectations

of the corporate sector in 2020 remained well

anchored, especially during the second half of

the year, while those of the household sector

remained elevated. Inflation expectations of the

corporate sector were on the high side during early

2020, before decelerating and settling around

mid-single digit levels in the remainder of the

year. Subdued aggregate demand amidst the

outbreak of COVID-19 and the expected favourable

developments on the domestic supply side

were among the major factors that drove inflation

expectations of the corporate sector. Household

sector respondents expected future inflation

to remain at high levels throughout the year,

highlighting factors such as expected decline

in domestic production along with the impact of

COVID-19, import restrictions, depreciation of

the Sri Lankan rupee, and increased government

expenditure during the times of elections. However,

both corporate and household sector respondents

expected upward pressures on inflation in the period

ahead due to the anticipated recovery in aggregate

demand as the impact of COVID-19 fades away

and due to the pent-up demand.

bills by the Central Bank from the primary

market and other operational measures

implemented by the Central Bank. Domestic

money market liquidity, which remained broadly

in surplus levels since mid-April 2019, was

maintained at significantly high levels since

the outbreak of COVID-19, thereby providing

sufficient space for financial markets to support

the affected businesses and individuals, and

the recovery in economic activity. Reductions in

the SRR1 in March and June 2020, the Central

Bank’s purchases of government securities from

the primary market, transfers of distributable

profits of the Central Bank to the Government, the

Central Bank’s purchases of foreign currency from

the domestic foreign exchange market, entering

into foreign currency swap agreements with

licensed banks, and the disbursement of credit

through the Saubagya COVID-19 Renaissance

Facility schemes, resulted in a notable increase

in domestic money market liquidity during

this period. Moreover, additional liquidity was

provided to standalone primary dealers as

required through the liquidity support facility

(LSF). Subsequently, overnight money market

liquidity increased to around Rs. 220 billion by

mid-June 2020 and the Central Bank allowed

this surplus liquidity conditions to remain in the

market, thereby inducing downward pressure on

market interest rates and encouraging credit

disbursements. The Central Bank conducted term

reverse repurchase auctions and provided liquidity

through the LSF during the period from end

September to mid-November 2020 amidst liquidity

absorptions arising from the scheduled foreign

loan repayments. Given these developments,

the daily liquidity in the domestic money market,

which on average remained around Rs. 30

billion in 2019, increased notably to around

market liquidity, on average, increased to around

Rs. 160 billion in the first quarter of 2021, despite

occasional reductions in liquidity due to scheduled

foreign loan repayments and maturities of

government securities. Excess liquidity in the

domestic money market was deposited at the

Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) window of the

Central Bank, while the access of the Standing

Lending Facility (SLF) by some participants was

observed during the period.

In response to the surplus liquidity

conditions in the domestic money market, the

AWCMR, which remained at the middle of the

policy rate corridor at the beginning of 2020,

declined and stayed closer to the lower bound

of the policy rate corridor from end June 2020.

Following the reduction in policy interest rates by

50 basis points by end January 2020, and the

subsequent policy rate reductions by a total of

100 basis points during the period from March

to May 2020, the AWCMR also declined, while

continuing to remain around the middle of the

policy rate corridor until mid-June 2020. With the

reduction in the SRR by 2 percentage points in

mid-June 2020, a significant amount of additional

liquidity was released to the market and the

AWCMR declined towards the lower bound of the

policy rate corridor. This downward adjustment in

the AWCMR was also supported by the limited

number of transactions in the interbank call

money market amidst surplus liquidity conditions.

Following the reduction in policy interest rates in

July 2020, the AWCMR also declined by around

100 basis points and hovered around the lower

bound of the policy rate corridor throughout the

remainder of 2020. The weighted average rates

on transactions in the repo market closely followed

the movements of the AWCMR, in spite of some

deviations due to the asymmetric distribution

of liquidity, particularly among the standalone

primary dealers. The weighted average rate on

transactions in the repo market was recorded at

4.57 per cent by end 2020.

Yields on Government Securities

The yields on government securities

recorded a notable decline during 2020,

reflecting the impact of monetary easing,

investor preference for government securities

amidst the pandemic, the Central Bank’s

purchases of government securities in primary

auctions, and the imposition of maximum

yield rates for acceptance on government

securities auctions in the primary market.

Accordingly, yields on government securities

declined by 226-414 basis points, across all

tenures,2 in primary and secondary markets

during the year, despite the notable increase in

domestic financing by the Government amidst

limited access to foreign financing. Increased

uncertainties and negative sentiments due to

the pandemic drove the banking sector towards

risk-free assets to some extent. Maximum yield

rates for acceptance were imposed by the

Government on both Treasury bills and Treasury

bonds at primary auctions, to guide the market on

yield rates. Given the exceptional circumstances

created by the pandemic, the Central Bank

purchased under-allocated amounts of Treasury

bills at primary market auctions, thereby fulfilling

funding requirements of the Government and

suppressing the yields on government securities.

Nevertheless, some upward pressure on yields

was observed, especially following the sovereign

rating downgrades and also during the auctions

conducted towards the end of the year, reflecting

the market sentiments on increased financing

requirements of the Government. By end 2020,

primary market yields on Treasury bills with

maturities of 91 days, 182 days and 364 days

were lower by 282, 322 and 340 basis points,

respectively, compared to end 2019. Yields on

Treasury bonds in the primary market declined by

284-414 basis points across all tenures2 during the

year. The Government relied mostly on short to

medium term financing during the year, as reflected

by only two issuances of Treasury bonds with

maturities of 10 years or more. In general,

Treasury bonds with shorter maturities recorded

large reductions of yield rates in the primary

market, compared to Treasury bonds with longer

maturities. The secondary market yields on

government securities also followed the trend

of the primary market yields. Secondary market

yields on Treasury bills declined by 288-338 basis

points across all tenures, while the decline of yields

on Treasury bonds ranged 226-311 basis points

across all tenures. Meanwhile, the Government

raised funds through US dollar denominated

Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) at various

fixed and floating rates during 2020. A total of

US dollars 507 million was raised from these

auctions at fixed interest rates in the range of

5.70-6.87 per cent, and floating rate agreements

with margins over 6-month London Inter-bank

Offered Rate (LIBOR) in the range of 388-609 basis

points. Driven by the negative investor sentiments

following Sri Lanka’s sovereign rating downgrades

by international rating agencies, secondary market

yields on Sri Lanka’s International Sovereign Bonds

(ISBs) increased to significantly high levels and

displayed continued volatility throughout the year.

Deposit and Lending Interest Rates

Market deposit rates decreased substantially

in response to monetary policy easing measures.

Accordingly, the Average Weighted New Deposit

Rate (AWNDR)3 and the Average Weighted New

Fixed Deposit Rate (AWNFDR)4 recorded their

lowest levels of 4.93 per cent in December 2020 and

5.07 per cent in November 2020, respectively,

since the beginning of their compilation in 2014.

The Average Weighted Deposit Rate (AWDR)5

reached its lowest level after August 2005, at

5.80 per cent at end 2020, and the Average

Weighted Fixed Deposit Rate (AWFDR)6

reached its lowest level after May 2015 at

7.14 per cent at end 2020. The pace of decline

in deposit rates slowed in the latter part of 2020.

Despite low levels of inflation, the substantial decline

in deposit rates resulted in some deposit products,

such as savings deposits and new short term fixed

deposits, earning negative real returns, thereby

affecting the segment of the population that depends

on interest income from deposits. This underscores

the need for alternative investment avenues in

a low interest rate regime, in order to minimise

the negative impact of low returns on savings,

particularly in the context of rapid population ageing.

Reflecting the impact of accommodative

monetary policy and other measures taken to

improve the monetary transmission mechanism,

market lending rates declined to historic low

levels, facilitating domestic investment to take

off. Accordingly, lending rates declined notably

Introduction

It is widely accepted that Micro, Small and Medium sized Enterprises (MSMEs) play a major role in the development of the economy due to their potential to promote inclusive growth by reducing regional inequalities of economic performance, and their capacity to develop into large organisations later on, thereby providing employment to a substantial proportion of the population and contributing to the economic growth of the country over their lifespan. The International Labour Organization (2019) reported that about 90 per cent of all enterprises in many countries consist of MSMEs, accounting for 70 per cent of employment globally. As per the economic census conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) in 2013/14 on non-agricultural economic activities,1 about 99 per cent of non-agricultural establishments in Sri Lanka were found to be MSMEs, while the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (2016) estimated that about 45 per cent of employment in the country is in the MSME sector.

Limited access to finance is cited as a key deterrent to the growth of MSMEs in Sri Lanka. According to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the major factors contributing to credit constraints of the MSME sector in Sri Lanka are, a) limitations within financial institutions, such as a risk-averse banking culture and heavy reliance on collateral, b) limitations within the market infrastructure, including insufficient mechanisms to overcome information asymmetries, and c) limitations within MSMEs, for example, poor financial literacy, lack of market knowledge and lack of transparency.2 In this regard, the lack of a regular flow

BOX 6Bank Credit to Micro, Small and Medium Sized Enterprises

of information to evaluate the amount of credit disbursed as well as interest rates charged on loans for the MSME sector remained a major information gap, hindering effective policymaking. This information gap was strongly felt in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which MSMEs were severely affected. Given the importance of such information, the Central Bank commenced a monthly survey on credit granted to MSMEs by licensed banks in July 2020. The main objective of the ‘SME Credit Survey’ is to identify the average cost of credit granted to MSMEs3 by licensed commercial banks (LCBs) and licensed specialised banks (LSBs). For this purpose, the corresponding quantum of loans is also collected to arrive at weighted average interest rates.

Findings of the SME Credit Survey

A preliminary assessment of the survey data indicated that the difference between the average interest rates on MSME lending by LCBs and the average market lending rates to all sectors, as measured in the Average Weighted Lending Rate (AWLR) and the Average Weighted New Lending Rate (AWNLR), was relatively small. However, when the interest rates were evaluated excluding large loans to the MSME sector, presumably for relatively large MSMEs with sufficiently high credit scores and collateral strength, the gap between the interest rates of lending to MSMEs and overall lending rates was large.

The recent decline in the overall market interest rates due to eased monetary conditions was observed in average lending rates to MSMEs as well. As per the

1 See DCS (2015)

2 See ADB (2017)

3 The manner in which MSMEs are defined varies across nations. In the case of Sri Lanka, different agencies seem to use varying definitions based on their respective objectives (DCS, 2015). For the purpose of the SME Credit Survey, banks are requested to consider establishments with an annual turnover not exceeding Rs. 1 billion and employ less than 300 employees, in order to be consistent with guidelines issued under some recent Directions by the Central Bank.

survey, the Average Weighted SME Lending Rate (AWSR), which is the weighted average interest rate of the outstanding stock of credit to MSMEs by all licensed banks, was recorded at 10.95 per cent by end 2020, while the Average Weighted New SME Lending Rate (AWNSR), which is the weighted average interest rate of new lending to MSMEs by all licensed banks, was 8.53 per cent for lending during December 2020. The average lending rates to MSMEs by LSBs, which mostly grant smaller loans in comparison to LCBs, were found to be higher than those of LCBs, making the average MSME rates of all licensed banks higher than the overall market lending rates. Of the outstanding loans granted to MSMEs by end 2020, the share of loans granted by LCBs was 90.2 per cent. Meanwhile, in terms of the number of loans granted, the share of LCBs was 50.2 per cent by end 2020.

The average interest rates on loans granted by licensed banks to MSMEs in the Agriculture sector were higher than those on loans granted to Industry and Services

sectors. Further, as per the distribution of loans in terms of loan size, average interest rates on large loans remained lower than smaller loans. However, since the initiation of this survey, small size loans also seemed to have attracted relatively low rates, compared to mid-sized loan groups.

The outstanding balance of credit granted to MSMEs was Rs. 743.0 billion as at end 2020,4 which was 11.1 per cent of total loans disbursed to the private sector by licensed banks.5 The Industry sector accounted for the largest share of outstanding loans, as well as new loans to MSMEs, both in terms of the amount and the number of loans. The Agriculture sector constituted the smallest share of MSME loans, both in terms of the amount and the number of loans, in the outstanding balance as well as new disbursements.

Most of the new lending granted to the MSME sector during recent months had been of short-term nature, whereas the stock of lending remained mostly balanced,

in terms of the maturity structure.6 This could mainly be due to the cashflow disruptions faced by the MSMEs amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey findings also revealed varying MSME exposures of banks, reflecting the differences in business models.

Sri Lanka’s MSME Sector Financing Compared to Regional Peers

A cross country comparison of lending to the MSME sector could be challenging due to differences in definitions of MSMEs and the relative importance of the MSME sector in respective economies. However, in a broad sense, compared to regional peers, such as the Republic of Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, whose economic progress in recent years has surpassed that of Sri Lanka, lending to the MSME sector of Sri Lanka by the formal banking sector remains comparatively weak. The share of credit granted to the MSME sector in Sri Lanka remains low,7 while the spread between average interest rates on loans granted to MSMEs, especially on small sized loans, and average interest rates on loans granted to prime customers remains high. Relatively high interest rate spreads may reflect a multitude of contributing factors, such as the level of financial market development, poor financial literacy of MSMEs, and their approach to banking practices. The importance of promoting the MSME sector could be observed through the success experienced by the Republic of Korea, where the share of manufacturing value added of MSMEs remained over 49 per cent in 2014,8 despite being home to some of the largest corporations in the world, such as Samsung, LG, and Hyundai.

6 Loans are classified as short term for loans up to and including one year, medium term for loans from one year up to and including five years, and long term for loans more than five years.

9 The OECD (2019) scoreboard contains information for the period 2007-17.10 The stock of MSME loans by LCBs measured in the SME Credit Survey, as a share of total credit to Agriculture, Industry and Services sectors, measured in the Quarterly Survey of Commercial Banks’ Loans and Advances to the Private Sector, by end 2020.11 As a corresponding interest rate for large firms is not available at present, the spread between the weighted average interest rate on new loans to MSMEs by LCBs during December 2020, as measured in the SME Credit Survey, and the monthly Average Weighted Prime Lending Rate (AWPR) for the corresponding month is considered.

Way Forward

The new survey on bank lending to MSMEs reinforces with data that limited access to low-cost financing remains a major constraint in the MSME sector in Sri Lanka. The recent policy measures, such as the support provided with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the introduction of credit scoring by the Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka (CRIB), encouraging MSMEs to access equity capital through the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) via initiatives such as the “Empower Board”, and the implementation of priority sector lending targets, could help the MSME sector to weather the current economic turmoil, while reaching the growth potential over the medium to long term. Measures such as the introduction of broader credit guarantee schemes or the establishment of a permanent credit guarantee institution could be helpful in improving access to finance for MSMEs, which would address the longstanding issue of the lack of acceptable collateral in the sector.

New SME Lending Rate (AWNSR),11 respectively,

at end 2020. Further, interest rates on loans granted

to agriculture sector SMEs remained higher than

those granted to SMEs in the industry and services

sectors, on average.

The Legal Rate and the Market Rate of

interest,12 as determined by the Monetary

Board and published in the Government

Gazette at the end of each year, remains at

10.12 per cent per annum for 2021, compared

to 11.64 per cent per annum for 2020. The Legal

Rate and the Market Rate for 2021 were computed

based on the simple averages of monthly AWDR

and AWLR of LCBs, which prevailed during the

preceding twelve months ending October 2020.

Interest Rates on Foreign Currency Deposits

Interest rates applicable on foreign currency

deposits maintained with LCBs showed mixed

movements during 2020. A substantial policy

11 AWNSR captures interest rates of all new rupee loans and advances extended by licensed banks during a particular month to the SME sector, excluding refinance schemes of the Government and the Central Bank.

12 The Legal Rate is defined under the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 6 of 1990, and is applicable to any action for the recovery of a sum of money. The Market Rate is defined under the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No. 2 of 1990, and applies only in relation to actions instituted by lending institutions for the recovery of debt exceeding Rs. 150,000 arising out of commercial transactions, where there is no agreed rate of interest.

easing was implemented by central banks around

the globe in 2020 to support the pandemic-hit

economies. During the year, the US Federal

Reserve reduced its federal funds target rate by

150 basis points, the Bank of England reduced

its official bank rate by 65 basis points, while

the European Central Bank kept its refinance

rate unchanged at the zero level. However, the

reduction of interest rates on foreign currency

deposits of domestic licensed banks was not

commensurate with the trend of global interest

rates as they competed to attract foreign currency

deposits amidst tight foreign currency liquidity

conditions in the domestic foreign exchange

market. Interest rates on US dollar denominated

savings deposits were reported in the range of

0.03-4.00 per cent by end 2020, compared to the

range of 0.02-4.50 per cent at end 2019. Interest

rates pertaining to savings deposits denominated

in pound sterling remained in the range of

0.03-3.00 per cent by end 2020, compared to

0.10-2.46 per cent at end 2019. Meanwhile,

interest rates on time deposits denominated in

US dollars were in the range of 0.10-6.00 per

cent by end 2020, in comparison to the range of

0.20-5.50 per cent recorded at end 2019. Further,

interest rates applicable on pound sterling

denominated time deposits were in the range of

0.05-4.25 per cent by end 2020, compared to the

range of 0.10-3.52 per cent at end 2019. Meanwhile,

with a view to attracting foreign currency deposits

to the country, the Government, in consultation

with the Central Bank, allowed LCBs and National

Savings Bank to mobilise foreign currency

deposits into the newly introduced Special Deposit

Accounts (SDA) in April 2020. These SDAs offered

interest rates of 1 percentage point per annum

above the normal rate for six-month deposits and

2 percentage points per annum above the normal

rate for twelve-month deposits.

7.4 Movements in Money and

Credit Aggregates

Reserve Money

Reserve money, which is the monetary base

of the economy, recorded a moderate growth

during 2020 mainly reflecting the

combined impact of the reduction in

the SRR and increase in currency in

circulation. With the cumulative reduction of

the SRR by 3 percentage points in 2020, about

Rs. 180 billion of liquidity was released to the money

market, reducing the deposits of LCBs with the

Central Bank in 2020. However, as the deposit base

of LCBs increased during the second half of the

year, their reserves with the Central Bank recorded

an increase towards end 2020. Nevertheless,

by end 2020, deposits of LCBs with the Central

Bank recorded a contraction of 49.1 per cent,

year-on-year, by Rs. 125.0 billion during 2020 to

Rs. 129.6 billion. Currency in circulation remained

at elevated levels during the year due to the high

demand for currency amidst the pandemic and the

low opportunity cost of holding currency due to low

deposit rates. With heightened uncertainty due to the

pandemic and associated lockdowns, precautionary

demand for money increased, resulting in a surge

in currency in circulation from late March 2020 to

mid-April 2020. The outbreak of the second wave

of COVID-19 caused further increase in currency

in circulation. Accordingly, currency in circulation

increased by Rs. 156.8 billion during the year to

Rs. 834.8 billion by end 2020, compared to an

expansion of Rs. 37.0 billion during 2019. On

a year-on-year basis, currency in circulation

recorded a growth of 23.1 per cent by end 2020,

compared to the growth of 5.8 per cent at end 2019.

Accordingly, the impact of the substantial reduction

in the SRR on reserve money was offset by the

increase in currency in circulation during the year,

resulting in an expansion of reserve money by

3.4 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2020, compared

to the contraction of 3.0 per cent recorded at

end 2019. In absolute terms, reserve money

increased by Rs. 31.8 billion during the year to

Rs. 964.4 billion by end 2020, compared to a

contraction of Rs. 28.5 billion during 2019.

Viewed from the assets side, the increase

in reserve money during 2020 was entirely

due to the expansion in net domestic assets

(NDA) of the Central Bank, while net foreign

assets (NFA) of the Central Bank recorded a

contraction. NDA of the Central Bank expanded

notably during 2020, driven by the increase in net

credit to the government (NCG) resulting from

the purchases of government securities from

the primary market, while the Central Bank’s

claims on LCBs also increased as a result of the

implementation of concessional credit schemes

amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The holding of

government securities by the Central Bank (net of

repurchase transactions) increased substantially

by Rs. 590.4 billion to Rs. 717.3 billion by end 2020

as the Central Bank purchased the under-allocated

quantum of Treasury bills at the primary market

auctions within the announced maximum yield

rates for acceptance. Further, the Central Bank’s

claims on LCBs also increased notably during the

second half of 2020 with the implementation of the

Saubagya COVID-19 Renaissance Facility and

the Liquidity Facility to Contractors and Suppliers

of the Government in line with the measures

taken under the provisions of the Monetary Law

Act No. 58 of 1949 to complement the efforts of

the Government in supporting the businesses

affected by the pandemic. Accordingly, the Central

Bank’s claims on LCBs increased notably by

Rs. 112.7 billion to Rs. 114.5 billion by end 2020.

The market participants continued to use the SDF

window of the Central Bank to deposit unutilised

surplus liquidity, mainly on an overnight basis.

As a result, balances under the SDF, which

remained around Rs. 25 billion, on average,

in 2019 expanded to around Rs. 130 billion,

on average, in 2020. Accordingly, NDA of the

Central Bank increased by Rs. 401.1 billion

during 2020 to Rs. 437.7 billion by end 2020, in

comparison to the decline of Rs. 173.9 billion

in 2019. Such expansion of NDA is expected

to be rolled back upon the normalisation of

aggregate demand conditions to prevent the

buildup of inflationary pressures in the future.

Meanwhile, NFA of the Central Bank declined by

Rs. 369.2 billion during 2020 due to the combined

effect of the decrease in foreign currency assets

and the increase in foreign currency liabilities

of the Central Bank. Foreign currency assets

declined particularly towards the end of 2020

due to foreign currency debt service payments

of the Government. Foreign currency liabilities

of the Central Bank expanded mainly due to the

repurchase agreement of US dollars 1.0 billion

with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in

September 2020 and the bilateral currency swap

agreement of US dollars 400 million with the

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in July 2020.

The money multiplier, which is the ratio

between broad money supply (M2b) and reserve

money, increased notably in 2020, reflecting

the effect of the reduction in the SRR and the

notable growth of M2b. The M2b money multiplier

increased to 9.75 at end 2020 from 8.18 recorded

at end 2019. The reduction in the SRR during the

year enhanced the space for money creation in

the banking system. Meanwhile, the currency to

deposits ratio increased to 7.3 per cent by end

2020 from 6.9 per cent recorded at end 2019, due

to the increase in demand for currency held by the

public.

Broad Money (M2b) and Domestic Credit

Broad money (M2b) growth accelerated

in 2020 due to the expansion in NDA of the

banking system, driven mainly by the credit

extended to the public sector, while NFA of

the banking system contracted during the

year. Reflecting the impact of the monetary easing

measures, the growth of M2b accelerated notably to

23.4 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2020, compared

to the growth of 7.0 per cent, year-on-year, at end

2019. NDA of the banking system increased by

Rs. 2,091.8 billion during 2020 mainly driven by

the increase in domestic credit, particularly the

increase in NCG by Rs. 1,752.1 billion during the

year. NFA of the banking system contracted by

Rs. 310.2 billion during 2020.

On the liability side of M2b, the increase

in time and savings deposits held by the

public with LCBs largely contributed to the

monetary expansion during 2020. Reflecting

the impact of dampened consumer spending

during the pandemic as well as the enhanced

appetite for saving in the banking sector over the

non-bank sector, time and savings deposits of

LCBs increased notably, recording a year-on-year

growth of 21.7 per cent by end 2020 compared to

7.3 per cent at end 2019. Meanwhile, currency and

demand deposits held by the public (i.e., M1) also

MONETARY POLICY, INTEREST RATES, MONEY AND CREDIT

7

183

increased during the year amidst the pandemic and

the notable decline in market interest rates, thus

increasing its contribution to the overall expansion

of M2b during 2020, compared to 2019.

Viewed from the asset side of M2b, NFA of

the banking system contracted during 2020

due to the decline in NFA of the Central Bank,

although NFA of LCBs recorded an increase

during the year. NFA of the Central Bank

contracted notably during 2020 due to the

repayment of foreign debt of the Government

utilising foreign reserves. In contrast, NFA of

LCBs increased during 2020, with the expansion

of NFA of offshore banking units (OBUs), amidst

a contraction of NFA of domestic banking units

(DBUs). An increase in placements with banks

abroad and lending to non-residents, along with

the decline in foreign borrowings led to the

expansion of NFA of OBUs during this period.

However, the notable expansion in workers’

remittances, which led to an increase in deposits of

non-residents together with increased borrowings

from abroad during 2020, resulted in a depletion

in NFA of DBUs.

NDA of the banking system expanded notably

during 2020, mainly driven by the increase in

credit to the public sector. Within NDA, NCG

by the banking system increased substantially by

Rs. 1,752.1 billion during 2020. This was mainly

due to the increase in domestic financing of the

Government amidst limited access to foreign

financing and the decline in government revenue.

Moreover, banks preferred to invest more in

government securities with surplus liquidity, while

being cautious in lending to the private sector

amidst the pandemic. Accordingly, NCG of LCBs

increased by Rs. 1,246.3 billion during 2020,

driven by investments in Treasury bills, Treasury

bonds and SLDBs as well as the increase in

government overdraft balances. Meanwhile, NCG

from the Central Bank increased by Rs. 505.9

billion during 2020, due to the net purchases of

government securities by the Central Bank at

primary auctions in view of the urgent financing

needs of the Government caused by the pandemic.

Following Parliamentary approval of the budget

estimates for 2020, provisional advances to the

Government by the Central Bank, which remained

at Rs. 237.8 billion by end November 2020,

declined to Rs. 153.1 billion by end 2020.

Credit extended to State Owned Business

Enterprises (SOBEs) by the banking system

recorded a notable expansion during 2020,

reflecting the weak financial position of

most SOBEs, aggravated by the pandemic.

Accordingly, credit obtained by SOBEs

from the banking system increased by

Rs. 184.2 billion during 2020. Although bank

borrowing by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation

(CPC) in foreign currency increased by around

Rs. 74 billion, CPC maintained a large rupee

deposit balance with the banking system in

2020. Meanwhile, bank borrowing by the Road

Development Authority (RDA) increased by

Rs. 53.6 billion during 2020. In addition, credit

Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC), Paddy

Marketing Board (PMB) and Ceylon Electricity

Board (CEB) increased notably during 2020, while

Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) made repayments

to LCBs during the year.

Credit extended to the private sector, which

was significantly affected by the onset of the

pandemic, recorded a gradual expansion since

August 2020 supported by accommodative

monetary conditions. Although some recovery

was observed in the growth of credit to the

private sector by LCBs during the first quarter of

2020 following a modest credit growth in 2019,

the momentum changed due to the spread of

COVID-19 and related lockdown measures. The

low credit expansion since April 2020, in spite of

large liquidity levels in the money market and

relatively low market interest rates, was driven by

the restrained supply of credit mainly due to the

risk averse behaviour of banks towards lending

during the pandemic. However, a gradual recovery

in credit to the private sector was observed

since August 2020 in response to eased

monetary conditions, including reduction in

lending rates to historic lows, along with the

implementation of concessional loan schemes

by the Central Bank. Accordingly, credit

extended to the private sector increased by

Rs. 374.1 billion during the year, recording a growth

of 6.5 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2020.

The expansion of credit to the private

sector in the second half of 2020 was mainly

driven by Personal Loans and Advances, while

direct credit to activities in the Agriculture,

Industry and Services sectors of the economy

remained low during the year. According to the

Quarterly Survey of Commercial Banks’ Loans

and Advances to the Private Sector, growth

of credit in the form of Personal Loans and

Advances accelerated notably to 15.1 per cent,

year-on-year, by end 2020. Within Personal Loans

and Advances, the Consumer Durables subsector

recorded a notable growth of 38.4 per cent,

year-on-year, by end 2020. Meanwhile, credit

granted under Pawning Advances grew by

17.9 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2020 reflecting

the increased appetite for such credit with the

reduction in maximum interest rates and increased

gold prices. However, Credit Card advances

contracted by 2.5 per cent, year-on-year, by end

2020, in comparison to the growth of 22.9 per cent

at end 2019. Meanwhile, credit to the Agriculture

and Fishing sector recorded a moderate growth

of 3.9 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2020. Within

this sector, credit flows to the Tea, Paddy, Rubber,

and Coconut subsectors recorded expansions

in 2020, while credit granted to the Vegetable

and Fruit Cultivation and Minor Food Crops, and

Fisheries subsectors recorded contractions by end

2020, compared to end 2019. Meanwhile, growth

of credit to the Industry sector accelerated to

4.7 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2020, from

3.1 per cent at end 2019. The construction

sector, which was affected significantly by the

pandemic-related lockdown during the early part of

2020, recorded a notable recovery supported by low

interest rates. Accordingly, within the Industry

sector, credit to the Construction subsector, which

accounted for around 53 per cent of the total

credit flows to the Industry sector, recorded a notable

growth of 12.6 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2020.

Credit to other subsectors, namely Textiles and

Apparel, and Food and Beverages also grew notably

by end 2020. However, credit to Fabricated Metal

Products, Machinery and Transport Equipment;

Chemical, Petroleum Pharmaceutical and

Healthcare, and Rubber and Plastic Products; and

Non-Metallic Mineral Products subsectors recorded

notable contractions by end 2020, compared to end

2019. Slowdown in overall economic activity with

the spread of COVID-19 and related containment

measures, along with import restrictions, affected

credit to the Services sector activities as well.

Accordingly, the growth of credit extended to

the Services sector decelerated to 1.4 per cent,

year-on-year, by end 2020, compared to the

growth of 3.1 per cent at end 2019. Contributing

to the slowdown in credit to the Services sector,

growth of credit to the Financial and Business

Services subsector contracted by 5.5 per cent,

year-on-year, by end 2020, compared to the

contraction of 6.5 per cent at end 2019, amidst

policy measures implemented to curtail the

importation of personal motor vehicles during

the year. Further, credit flows to Wholesale and

Retail Trade; and Shipping, Aviation and Freight

Forwarding subsectors also contracted by end

2020, compared to end 2019. Nevertheless,

amidst the debt moratorium granted to tourism

related industries and other measures, including

special concessional loan schemes to support

the pandemic-affected businesses, credit to

the Tourism subsector expanded by end 2020.

Further, in terms of the maturity of outstanding

credit to the private sector by LCBs, a slowdown

was observed in short term credit facilities, while

an expansion was observed in medium and long

term credit, possibly indicating a shift in customer

loan portfolios towards longer maturities to benefit

from low interest rates. Overall, the increase

in Personal Loans and Advances contributed

around 58 per cent to the expansion of credit

extended to the private sector during 2020, while

the increase in credit to the Industry, Services

and Agriculture and Fishing sectors contributed

around 31 per cent, 6 per cent and 5 per cent,

respectively. As the expansion of credit towards

productive sectors of the economy remained

inadequate, the Central Bank, with the support of

the banking community, announced priority sector

lending targets for banks on lending to the MSME

sector in January 2021.

Broad Money (M4)

Growth of broad money supply (M4),

as measured by the Financial Survey,13

accelerated to 21.4 per cent, year-on-year,

by end 2020, led by the expansion in NDA

of licensed banks. On the assets side of M4,

contributing to the increase in NDA, domestic

credit of licensed specialised banks (LSBs)

increased by Rs. 250.7 billion during 2020,

while domestic credit of licensed finance

companies (LFCs) recorded a contraction of

Rs. 2.8 billion during the year. Within domestic

credit of M4, overall NCG increased notably by

Rs. 1,882.8 billion during 2020, while NCG by

LSBs and LFCs increased by Rs. 128.4 billion

and Rs. 2.3 billion, respectively. As per M4,

credit extended to the private sector increased

by Rs. 491.3 billion during 2020, recording a

year-on-year growth of 6.3 per cent, by end

2020, compared to the growth of 3.9 per cent,

year-on-year, at end 2019. Contributing around

25 per cent to the expansion of total credit

extended to the private sector as per M4, credit

extended to the private sector by LSBs increased

considerably by Rs. 122.3 billion during 2020,

recording a year-on-year growth of 15.0 per cent.

However, credit extended to the private sector

by LFCs contracted by Rs. 5.1 billion during the

year, resulting in a year-on-year contraction of

0.4 per cent by end 2020. This could be attributed

to the slowdown in vehicle related loans amidst

restrictions on vehicle imports and increased

risk aversion due to high non-performing loans

(NPLs) in the non-bank financial sector. Although

overall NFA of M4 contracted during 2020, NFA

of LSBs increased by Rs. 4.3 billion during

the year due to the decline in foreign liabilities.

Viewed from the liabilities side of M4, total

time and savings deposits held by the public

grew by 20.0 per cent, year-on-year, by end

2020, compared to the growth of 8.5 per cent,

year-on-year, at end 2019. Time and savings

deposits held with LSBs grew notably by

21.6 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2020,

compared to 17.8 per cent at end 2019. However,

reflecting the impact of the termination of

licenses and business activities of certain finance

companies as well as the gradual shift of deposits

from LFCs to banking sector institutions due to

heightened uncertainties amidst the pandemic,

time and savings deposits with LFCs contracted

marginally by 0.7 per cent, year-on-year, by end

2020, compared to the growth of 4.9 per cent,

year-on-year, at end 2019.
