6.1 OverviewA

t the turn of the year 2020, fiscal policy was focused on reviving a stagnant economy. However, with

the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, the fiscal outcome deviated from expectations,

as reflected in the decline of the government revenue and a rise in government recurrent expenditure,

thereby widening the budget deficit and raising the outstanding central government debt. Heavy reliance

on domestic sources in financing the budget deficit in 2020 reflected the impact of extremely challenging

global market conditions that limited access to foreign financing, and the expressed preference of the

Government to reduce the reliance on foreign financing. According to the Ministry of Finance, the provisional

estimates of the fiscal sector statistics for 2020 have been adjusted for payment arrears carried forward

from 2019.1 Meanwhile, in the absence of an annual budget approved by the Parliament for 2020 from the

beginning of the year, fiscal operations in 2020 were performed under the Votes-on-Account (VoAs) and

the authorisation of His Excellency the President as per the provisions of Article 150 (3) of the Constitution.

In November 2020, the Parliament approved the Annual Budget for 2020, which comprised the VoAs and

the authorisation of His Excellency the President. Despite the limited fiscal space in 2020, the Government,

under extremely challenging circumstances, continued to support the businesses and individuals affected

by the pandemic. Going forward, near term risks to the fiscal sector could remain elevated due to low

revenue mobilisation and the large foreign currency debt service requirements. Persistent deviations of the

budget deficit and the elevated level of outstanding central government debt warrant a firm commitment

towards fiscal consolidation as envisaged in the National Policy Framework of the Government.

1 The estimates of government revenue, expenditure, and fiscal balances for 2019 and 2020, described in this Report, incorporate the adjustment for payment arrears, as per the data received from the Ministry of Finance.

6.2 Fiscal Policy Measures2

The fiscal policy direction and measures were

broadly aimed at supporting the businesses

and individuals affected by the pandemic,

while facilitating the recovery of economic

activity in 2020. The policies implemented by the

Government at the turn of year 2020 with a view

to promoting economic growth by reducing the tax

rates also helped to minimise the adverse impact

of the pandemic. Fiscal operations in 2020 were

carried out under the VoAs and the authorisation of

His Excellency the President as per the provisions

of Article 150 (3) of the Constitution, in the absence

of an annual budget approved by the Parliament until

late 2020, due to admissible delays in presenting

the Budget 2020, ensuing the Presidential Election

in November 2019. The budgetary provisions for

expenditures and advances and borrowings under

the VoAs and the authorisation of His Excellency the

President for 2020 were cumulatively presented to

the Parliament in November 2020 and the approved

budgetary estimates for 2020 were published in the

Appropriation Act No. 6 of 2020,3 gazetted on 20

November 2020. Meanwhile, the Appropriation Act

for 2021 was gazetted on 10 December 2020. During

the year, the Government focused on strengthening

the 2020-2025 medium term programme of poverty

alleviation and economic revival, as envisaged in

the National Policy Framework of the Government

“Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour”. Accordingly,

the Government aspired to ensure the economic

freedom of the people through the creation of a

production and export oriented economy, facilitated

by the framework of a market economy. Further,

the Government emphasised the need to promote

a balanced trade policy in view of enhancing export

2 The key fiscal policy measures discussed in this section are detailed in Box 10, ‘Major Economic Policy Measures’. 3 Certain expenditures and advances made under Resolutions passed under Article 150(2) and authorised under 150(3) of the Constitution were included in the First Schedule, Second Schedule and Third Schedule, of the Appropriation Act for 2020, while borrowings made in terms of Resolutions passed under Article 150(2) were included under Section 2(1)(b) of the Appropriation Act for 2020.

earnings through diversification, while highlighting

the need to secure foreign exchange inflows in order

to fulfil external debt servicing obligations. In addition,

the deficit financing strategy of the Government

shifted towards mobilising domestic funds, thereby

reducing exposure to foreign liabilities in the period

ahead.

The fiscal strategy of the Government focused

on ensuring a sustained and high economic

growth over the medium term. Improving

economic and social infrastructure was recognised

as an integral part of the overall development drive

of the Government. To this end, public investment is

expected to be maintained at around 5.0 – 6.0 per

cent of GDP, per annum, over the medium term. As

enunciated in the National Policy Framework, the

Government remained committed to addressing

income disparities across different segments of the

society. Minimising infrastructure gaps in various

economic sectors, such as roads, housing, power

and energy, education, science and technology,

etc., remained priorities in spite of the challenges

stemming from the pandemic. The Government

initiated measures to review foreign funded projects

in the pipeline in order to streamline them according

to the national development priorities. Further,

measures were taken to identify projects, which can

be implemented through foreign investment, thereby

lessening the debt burden of the Government.

Further, according to the National Policy Framework

and the National Budget for 2021, greater emphasis

was placed on the introduction of Public Private

Partnerships (PPPs), thus enhancing private sector

contribution to economic growth.

The Government implemented measures

to lower the tax burden of businesses and

individuals, thereby supporting the rebounding

of economic activity and enhancing the income

of people. Major tax revisions initiated since late

2019 included lowering the income tax rates and

the Value Added Tax (VAT) rate, raising the VAT

threshold, and abolishing the Nation Building

Tax (NBT) and Economic Service Charge (ESC).

These measures were expected to enable a strong

rebound of economic activity in spite of their adverse

impact on government revenue in the near term.

The Government expects that the revenue collection

will increase over the medium term, benefiting from

the expected expansion of activity with low tax rates,

which will be maintained over the medium term

and the envisaged high and sustainable economic

growth.

Amendments to the Inland Revenue Act No.

24 of 2017, progressed during 2020, in line with

the revisions proposed in late 2019, targeted at

simplifying the tax structure, while providing

support for businesses and individuals.4

Revisions were introduced to personal income tax

rates, the tax free threshold and the income tax

calculation bands, as detailed in Box 10, ‘Major

Economic Policy Measures’ of this Report.

The tax concessions introduced at the outset

of the COVID-19 pandemic reinforced the fiscal

stimulus measures implemented since late

4 As announced by the Inland Revenue Department in late 2019, tax revisions were implemented with effect from 01 January 2020, subject to the approval of the Parliament. The Economic Service Charge Amendment Act No. 4 of 2020, was enacted on 12 October 2020 on the removal of the Economic Service Charge (ESC). Further, a Bill for the amendments to the Value Added Tax Act No. 14 of 2002, was gazetted on 18 March 2021.

2019, thereby minimising the adverse impact

of the pandemic on businesses and individuals

in 2020. In addition to the sweeping concessions

granted in late 2019, major concessions introduced

in 2020 included exemptions of the Ports and

Airports Development Levy (PAL) and the CESS

on the importation of selected health related

equipment, extensions to payment timelines of

Withholding Tax (WHT) and VAT, and directions

on penalty payment exemptions for all taxes during

the lockdown period. Further, small and medium

scale enterprises (SMEs) were granted various tax

relief measures in the form of waivers of income tax

arrears on assessments issued up to the year of

assessment 2018/2019, non-issuance of additional

assessments for the year of assessment 2019/2020,

granting of a grace period to settle taxes in arrears/

default, extension on seizure notices and extended

timelines for tax payments and filing tax returns.

The National Budget 2021 proposed further tax

measures, including tax exemptions, reduction of

income tax for certain businesses, simplification of

tax calculations and enforcing tax administration.5

Revisions were made to international trade

related taxes in view of maintaining stable

prices, while easing pressure on the balance of

payments (BOP) and the exchange rate amidst

the pandemic. Accordingly, upward revisions

were made to Customs duty and a surcharge was

imposed on the importation of petrol and diesel to

maintain domestic retail prices at the same level

during the year. Also, Customs duty on certain

items, including tobacco products, was increased

in the range of 25-50 per cent. Customs duty on

imported goods was simplified to 0 per cent,

10 per cent and 15 per cent from 0 per cent,

15 per cent and 30 per cent, with effect from 18

November 2020. In addition to exemptions granted

on CESS and PAL, the Special Commodity Levy

(SCL) on certain essential medical equipment was

revised in order to support the domestic producers,

while reducing volatility in domestic market prices.

Several measures aimed at strengthening

the tax administration were initiated during

2020. The automation processes were expedited

with modifications to the Automated System

for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) of the Sri Lanka

Customs (SLC). The ASYCUDA system was

modified enabling importers to submit documents

to the SLC without being physically present. A

revenue reporting module was developed at the

SLC in order to report daily revenue collections to

the Ministry of Finance (MOF) under the Integrated

Treasury Management Information System (ITMIS).

The spending agencies, including all departments

of the General Treasury, the Parliament, National

Audit Office, among others, were integrated with

ITMIS in 2020, and more spending agencies are

to be integrated with ITMIS from June 2021. The

Inland Revenue Department (IRD) introduced an

Alternative Tax Payment System (ATPS) via online

payment platforms to strengthen tax revenue

mobilisation, while conducting several general

services online, including the issuance of Taxpayer

Identification Numbers (TIN), temporary VAT

registrations for importers, etc. Under the Revenue

Administration Management Information System

(RAMIS), the automation of stamp duty collection

was completed in 2020.

Government expenditure rationalisation

measures continued in 2020, including the

curtailment of expenditure on items, such

as the acquisition of vehicles, buildings, etc.

Several measures were initiated to manage public

expenditure against the backdrop of weakened

revenue mobilisation amidst the pandemic. All

ministries and departments were advised to limit

expenditure within the allocated provisions, while

avoiding non essential expenses during 2020.

Meanwhile, digitalisation of systems and processes

continued, including the rollout of e-procurement

and the e-National Identity Card project. Further,

the National Pay Commission was established

in February 2020, to revisit all remuneration

structures of the public sector as well as the private

sector, and to advise the Government regarding

formulation and implementation of a national wage

policy.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the pension

payment process was streamlined through

several efficiency enhancing measures. The

digital life certificate project commenced during

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2020

152

6

the first half of 2020, thereby allowing pensioners

to provide their life certificate using fingerprints

in lieu of the existing documentation process.

This eliminated the need for the life certificate

being sent to Divisional Secretariats every year

in order to verify the life/residence of pensioners.

In addition, facilities were provided for pensioners

to appoint a guardian, whenever the pensioner

is unable to receive the pension in person due to

difficulties arising from serious physical or mental

health issues. Further, the Widowers and Orphans

(W & OP) pension activation was entrusted to

Divisional Secretaries through the introduction of a

web based programme in order to ensure accuracy

and efficiency of the payment process.

A public sector recruitment programme

was commenced with a view to uplifting the

living standards of underprivileged households

and enhancing public sector contribution to

the economy. The Government commenced the

recruitment programme in January 2020, aimed

at recruiting 100,000 unskilled individuals from

low income families, while another recruitment

programme was commenced in February 2020

to provide employment opportunities for 50,000

unemployed graduates and diploma holders, who

had been unable to secure employment during

the preceding three years. These recruitment

programmes were suspended in March 2020,

ensuing the announcement of the general elections

held in August 2020, and recommenced in early

September 2020, with the approval of the Cabinet

of Ministers to recruit a further 10,000 graduates.

The welfare programmes of the Government

continued to facilitate the needy segments of

the society, along with measures to streamline

the operations of the Welfare Benefits Board

(WBB). A cash allowance of Rs. 5,000 was granted

to senior citizens, differently-abled persons, kidney

patients, farmers, and displaced daily workers

in April and May 2020 due to the COVID-19

pandemic. Measures were taken to provide an

interest free advance of Rs. 10,000 to Samurdhi

beneficiaries during the lockdown in 2020, and a

one month grace period was granted to the general

public for the payment of utility bills. In addition,

Agrahara insurance benefits were increased for

police officers, tri-forces personnel, officers in the

health sector and other government employees,

who were engaged in COVID-19 prevention

activities. The WBB signed an MoU with the

Department of Samurdhi to obtain data required

for the commencement of activities in the Social

Registry Information System (SRIS), which is an

electronic database for storing information related

to the welfare programmes of the Government. The

SRIS is expected to be extended into an Integrated

Welfare Management System (IWMS) in order to

enhance the selection procedure of beneficiaries

for various welfare programmes. The Department

of Samurdhi intends to establish a ‘Graduation

Cell’ aimed at developing and implementing a

graduation policy for the Samurdhi programme in

order to support Samurdhi recipients enhance their

incomes and move out of the welfare programme.

Several measures were implemented to

improve the financial viability of State Owned

Business Enterprises (SOBEs), while lessening

the burden on the Government. A special

committee was established in early 2020 to appoint

suitable personnel for key positions in SOBEs, and

thereby strengthening the financial viability of these

institutions. The Fuel Price Stabilisation Fund

(FPSF) was established with a view to ensuring

equitable distribution of the benefits of the unusual

decline in international oil prices across the

economy, rather than revising domestic fuel prices.

Accordingly, the Fund was established with an initial

capital of Rs. 50 billion by issuing Treasury bills (on

face value basis) to the Central Bank on 23 March

FISCAL POLICY AND GOVERNMENT FINANCE

153

2020. The revenue collected from the surcharge

on petrol and diesel imports was transferred to the

FPSF. The FPSF was partly utilised to settle the

dues of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to the

Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) during 2020,

and the fund recorded a balance of Rs. 379.1

million at the end of 2020.

Rating agencies downgraded Sri Lanka’s

sovereign credit ratings in 2020, citing risks on

external debt repayments, external financing

and the deterioration of fiscal balances

amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. In April

and May 2020, Fitch Ratings and S&P Global

Ratings downgraded Sri Lanka’s sovereign ratings

to ‘B-’, while asserting the outlook at negative and

stable, respectively. In September 2020, Moody’s

Investors Service, which placed Sri Lanka's ratings

of ‘B2’ under review in April 2020, downgraded Sri

Lanka’s sovereign ratings by two notches to ‘Caa1’

and changed the outlook to stable from negative.

In November 2020, Fitch Ratings downgraded

Sri Lanka’s sovereign credit rating to ‘CCC’. In

December 2020, S&P Global Ratings downgraded

Sri Lanka’s sovereign credit rating to ‘CCC+’ with

a stable outlook. Despite the adverse speculations

of the rating agencies, the Government repaid all

its debt servicing obligations in 2020, including the

International Sovereign Bond (ISB) of US dollars

1 billion, which matured on 6 October 2020.

6.3 Government Budgetary Operations

Revenue and Grants

Revenue

Government revenue declined in 2020, both

in nominal terms and as a percentage of GDP,

reflecting the combined impact of subdued

economic performance due to the COVID-19

pandemic, the tax revisions implemented from

late 2019, and the tax concessions granted

to businesses and individuals affected by the

pandemic. Accordingly, total revenue declined by

27.7 per cent to Rs. 1,368.0 billion in 2020 from

Rs. 1,890.9 billion in 2019. Tax revenue declined

by 29.9 per cent to Rs. 1,216.5 billion in 2020 from

Rs. 1,734.9 billion in 2019, mainly due to low

revenue from income tax, VAT, NBT, CESS and

excise duties. The relative share of revenue from

direct taxes declined to 22.1 per cent in 2020 from

24.7 per cent in the previous year, mainly reflecting

the impact of subdued incomes of businesses

and individuals amidst the pandemic. The share

of revenue from indirect taxes accounted for

77.9 per cent of total tax revenue in 2020. Non

tax revenue declined marginally by 2.9 per cent to

Rs. 151.4 billion, reflecting the reduction in

revenue collection from fees and charges and

profit transfers of SOBEs. As a percentage of

GDP, total revenue declined to 9.1 per cent in

2020 from 12.6 per cent in 2019, reflecting the

reduction in tax revenue to 8.1 per cent in 2020

from 11.6 per cent in 2019, while non tax revenue

collection remained unchanged at 1.0 per cent

in 2020.

Revenue from income tax declined, both in

nominal terms and as a percentage of GDP,

reflecting the reduction of revenue from all the

categories of income tax in 2020. In nominal

terms, revenue from income tax declined by

37.3 per cent to Rs. 268.2 billion in 2020 from

Rs. 427.7 billion in 2019, and as a percentage

of GDP, it declined to 1.8 per cent in 2020 from

2.8 per cent in 2019. The decline in income tax

revenue was mainly attributable to the abolition

of PAYE tax and ESC, along with the revisions

to WHT and corporate and non corporate income

tax with effect from January 2020. Revenue from

PAYE tax collected for the financial year 2019

and remitted in 2020, together with the revenue

on account of APIT, which was introduced in lieu

of PAYE tax since 01 April 2020, recorded at

Rs. 15.0 billion in 2020, compared to PAYE tax

revenue of Rs. 49.4 billion in 2019. Revenue from

ESC was recorded at Rs. 15.0 billion in 2020,

compared to Rs. 55.3 billion in 2019 due to the

arrears collected for 2019. Revenue collection

from WHT declined notably to Rs. 10.0 billion

in 2020 from Rs. 50.4 billion recorded in 2019,

mainly due to the amendments to WHT. Revenue

from corporate and non-corporate income tax

declined by 16.2 per cent to Rs. 228.3 billion

in 2020 from Rs. 272.6 billion in 2019, mainly

reflecting the revisions to personal income tax

rates and corporate income tax rates, with effect

from 01 January 2020.

Revenue from VAT and excise duties

declined amidst the slowdown in economic

activity and the reduction of the VAT rate

from 15 per cent to 8 per cent effective from

01 December 2019. As a percentage of GDP,

revenue from VAT declined to 1.6 per cent in

2020 from 3.0 per cent in 2019, while in nominal

terms, VAT revenue declined significantly by

47.3 per cent to Rs. 233.8 billion in 2020 from

Rs. 443.9 billion in 2019. The revenue from VAT

on domestic economic activities declined by

46.0 per cent to Rs. 148.1 billion in 2020 from

Rs. 274.0 billion in 2019 while the revenue from

VAT on imports declined by 49.5 per cent to

Rs. 85.7 billion in 2020 from Rs. 169.9 billion

in 2019. Revenue from excise duties, as a

percentage of GDP, declined to 2.2 per cent in

2020, compared to 2.7 per cent in 2019, mainly

on account of lower revenue collection from

excise duty on motor vehicles and petroleum

products. Revenue collection from excise duty

on motor vehicles declined to Rs. 48.8 billion

in 2020 from Rs. 130.4 billion in 2019, due to

the contraction of motor vehicle imports amidst

the restrictions imposed to curtail non-essential

imports during 2020. Revenue from excise duty

on petroleum products declined to Rs. 53.1

billion in 2020 from Rs. 61.7 billion in 2019,

reflecting the relatively low volume of imports of

petroleum products. Nevertheless, revenue from

excise duty on cigarettes and tobacco and liquor

increased during the year, reflecting the upward

revisions to excise duty on cigarettes and liquor

in December 2019. Accordingly, revenue from

excise duty on cigarettes and tobacco, and liquor

increased by 8.0 per cent and 4.8 per cent to

Rs. 94.3 billion and Rs. 121.0 billion, respectively,

in 2020 over the previous year. Meanwhile,

the arrears collected on the NBT amounted to

Rs. 2.4 billion in 2020, following the abolition of

NBT in December 2019.

Revenue from international trade related

taxes showed an improvement in 2020, reflecting

the impact of tax amendments, despite the

contraction of imports during 2020. Accordingly,

revenue collection from import duties increased

to Rs. 114.2 billion in 2020 from Rs. 98.4 billion in

2019, partly due to the increase in Customs duty

on petroleum products since April 2020 and the

removal of duty waivers for petroleum products in

March and April 2020. Revenue mobilisation from

SCL increased by 17.5 per cent to Rs. 82.7 billion

in 2020 due to the upward revisions of SCL rates.

Reflecting the increase in the standard PAL rate to

10.0 per cent from 7.5 per cent, revenue from PAL

increased to Rs. 115.4 billion in 2020, compared to

Rs. 112.2 billion in 2019, in spite of the exemptions

granted on several items and the contraction of

imports following the restrictions on non essential

imports.

During the year, non tax revenue declined

in nominal terms, while remaining unchanged

at 1.0 per cent of GDP. In nominal terms, non

tax revenue declined to Rs. 151.4 billion in 2020,

compared to Rs. 156.0 billion in 2019. The

reduction in revenue from fees and charges, and

profit and dividend transfers from SOBEs amidst

the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly contributed to the

decline in non tax revenue in nominal terms during

2020. Accordingly, fees and charges declined by

35.9 per cent to Rs. 47.4 billion in 2020 from Rs. 73.9

billion in 2019, while profit and dividend transfers

declined to Rs. 17.6 billion in 2020, compared to

Rs. 27.9 billion in 2019. However, revenue from

social security contributions increased to Rs. 32.4

billion in 2020 from Rs. 29.0 billion in 2019, while

rent and interest income increased by 4.3 per cent to

Rs. 19.4 billion in 2020 from Rs. 18.5 billion in 2019.

The Central Bank transferred distributable profits

to the Government amounting to Rs. 24.0 billion in

2020 as against no profit transfer in 2019.

Grants

Foreign grants received from bilateral and

multilateral sources declined to Rs. 5.3 billion

in 2020 from Rs. 7.9 billion in 2019. Foreign

grants from bilateral sources declined to Rs. 2.8

billion in 2020 from Rs. 5.1 billion in 2019, while

foreign grants from multilateral sources declined to

Rs. 2.5 billion in 2020 from Rs. 2.8 billion in 2019.

Development partners, which provided grants during

2020, included the Government of Japan, the Asian

Development Bank (ADB), and the Department of

Agriculture of the United States.

Expenditure and Net Lending

Government expenditure and net lending in

2020 were adjusted by the Ministry of Finance

by shifting a sum of Rs. 422.6 billion to 2019 in

view of accounting for the payment of arrears

spilled over from 2019. Accordingly, of the

recurrent expenditure incurred in 2020, a sum

of Rs. 123.4 billion was shifted to 2019, and of

the capital expenditure and net lending in 2020,

a sum of Rs. 299.2 billion was shifted to 2019.

With these adjustments, government expenditure

and net lending in 2020 declined to 20.3 per cent

of GDP (Rs. 3,041.0 billion), from 22.2 per cent

of GDP (Rs. 3,337.9 billion) in 2019. The decline

in government expenditure and net lending was

attributed to the notable reduction in capital

expenditure and net lending to 3.3 per cent of

GDP (Rs. 492.6 billion) in 2020 from 6.1 per cent

of GDP (Rs. 913.3 billion) in 2019. In contrast,

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2020

the recurrent expenditure increased to 17.0 per

cent of GDP (Rs. 2,548.4 billion), compared to

16.1 per cent (Rs. 2,424.6 billion) in 2019.

The increase in recurrent expenditure in

2020 was mainly due to the rise in expenditure

on subsidies and transfers, salaries and wages

and interest payments. Expenditure on current

transfers and subsidies increased during the

year, both in nominal terms and as a percentage

of GDP, mainly due to the increase in current

transfers to the household sector. Transfers and

subsidies to the household sector increased on

account of the rise in expenditure on pension

payments, social security and welfare schemes

for needy segments of the society, as well as the

additional expenditure incurred due to the cash

grant for vulnerable groups and unexpected and

unprecedented increase in expenditure incurred

on healthcare and other related activities to

deal with the spread of COVID-19 pandemic.

Expenditure on salaries and wages increased

in 2020 over the previous year, reflecting the

impact of the inclusion of an interim allowance on

a progressive basis to the basic salary with the

implementation of the new salary structure from

January 2016 for public sector employees, granting

an interim allowance of Rs. 2,500 per month to

public sector employees with effect from 01 July

2019, an increase of general annual increments

of public employees and salaries paid to new

recruits during 2020. The expenditure on interest

payments, which accounted for the largest share

of recurrent expenditure, increased both as a

percentage of GDP and in nominal terms in 2020.

This increase was reflected in domestic interest

payments as well as in foreign interest payments.

Interest payments on outstanding domestic debt,

which accounted for 72.8 per cent of total interest

payments increased to Rs. 713.6 billion in 2020,

from Rs. 667.4 billion in 2019, mainly due to the

increased net domestic financing, that outweighed

the impact of the notable decline in yields on

government securities and other domestic interest

rates. Interest payments on foreign debt increased

by 14.0 per cent to Rs. 266.7 billion in 2020

from Rs. 234.0 billion in 2019, mainly reflecting

the impact of increased interest payments on

outstanding commercial debt. Interest payments

accounted for 38.5 per cent of the total recurrent

expenditure, and was equivalent to 71.7 per cent

of the government revenue in 2020.

Capital expenditure and net lending declined

to 3.3 per cent of GDP in 2020 from 6.1 per cent

of GDP in 2019. This decline reflects the impact of

the limited fiscal space due to the notable decline

in government revenue and the rise in recurrent

expenditure, along with the adjustment of arrears

payment of capital expenditure, which amounted

to 2.0 per cent of GDP.

Key Fiscal Balances and Financing the Budget Deficit

The key fiscal balances deteriorated in 2020,

reflecting the decline in government revenue

and the increase in recurrent expenditure,

alongside the contraction of economic activity

due to the pandemic. As per the fiscal sector

statistics of the Ministry of Finance, the overall

budget deficit as a percentage of GDP increased

to 11.1 per cent (Rs. 1,667.7 billion) in 2020 from

9.6 per cent (Rs. 1,439.1 billion) in 2019. The

current account deficit, which reflects dissavings

of the Government, increased to 7.9 per cent

of GDP (Rs. 1,180.4 billion) in 2020 from

3.6 per cent of GDP (Rs. 533.7 billion) in 2019.

Meanwhile, the primary deficit, which excludes

interest payments from the overall budget deficit

and reflects the discretionary component of fiscal

policy, increased to 4.6 per cent of GDP (Rs. 687.4

billion) in 2020, compared to 3.6 per cent of GDP

(Rs. 537.7 billion) in 2019. The Government relied

on domestic sources in financing the budget deficit

in 2020, reflecting on the one hand, the impact of

extremely challenging global market conditions,

which restricted access to foreign financing by

the Government in 2020, and on the other hand,

the expressed preference of the Government

to reduce the reliance on foreign financing in

recognition of the external debt burden. As per

the Ministry of Finance, net domestic financing

amounted to Rs. 1,750.9 billion (11.7 per cent

of GDP) in 2020, compared to Rs. 896.4 billion

(6.0 per cent of GDP) in 2019, while foreign

financing recorded a net repayment of Rs. 83.2

billion in 2020 (0.6 per cent of GDP), compared

to Rs. 542.6 billion of net foreign financing

(3.6 per cent of GDP) in 2019.

6.4 Government Debt and Debt

Service Payments

Central Government Debt

At end 2020, central government debt

increased, both in nominal terms and as a

percentage of GDP, driven by the increase

in domestic debt, while outstanding foreign

debt recorded a sizeable decline, over 2019.

The significant increase in net domestic financing

by the Government in 2020, amidst the decline

in government revenue and the rise in recurrent

expenditure contributed to the increase in

outstanding central government debt by the end

of 2020. Limited access to foreign financing by

the Government due to unfavourable market

conditions in 2020 resulted in net repayments

of foreign debt, while the increased appetite of

resident financial institutions for holding ISBs

issued by the Government of Sri Lanka, due

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2020

6

to the rise in yields amidst the pandemic also

helped lower the outstanding foreign debt at end

2020, alongside the Government’s preference for

domestic financing over foreign financing. The

outstanding central government debt increased to

Rs. 15,117.2 billion at end 2020 from Rs. 13,031.5

billion at end 2019. As a percentage of GDP,

the outstanding central government debt rose

to 101.0 per cent as at end 2020, compared to

86.8 per cent6 at end 2019. The contraction in

nominal GDP in 2020 also contributed to the

increase of central government debt to GDP ratio at

end 2020. Of the nominal increase in outstanding

central government debt, the parity variation, which

is an outcome of the depreciation of the exchange

rate, resulted in an increase of the rupee value

of foreign debt by Rs. 355.7 billion at end 2020.

Central government domestic debt as a percentage

of GDP rose to 60.6 per cent at the end of 2020,

compared to 45.5 per cent at end 2019, and central

government foreign debt as a percentage of GDP

declined to 40.4 per cent at the end 2020 from

41.3 per cent at end 2019. The relative share of

outstanding domestic debt of central government

increased to 60.0 per cent of total debt at end 2020,

from 52.4 per cent at end 2019, while the share

of central government foreign debt recorded a

notable decline to 40.0 per cent at end 2020, from

47.6 per cent at end 2019. Despite the notable

increase of outstanding central government debt,

certain debt management indicators showed an

improvement against the benchmarks specified

under the Medium Term Debt Management

Strategy (MTDS). Accordingly, by end 2020, the

level of outstanding central government foreign

currency debt as a share of total outstanding

debt was lower at 47.5 per cent, compared to

the benchmark of 54.0 per cent at end 2018, and

6 The central government debt statistics at end 2019 could increase should the adjustment for payment arrears in government expenditure as per the Ministry of Finance be incorporated into the net financing of the budget deficit in 2019. However, such an adjustment would have no impact on the outstanding central government debt at end 2020.

the average time to maturity (ATM) of the foreign

currency debt portfolio extended to 6.72 years,

compared to the benchmark of 6.60 years at end

2018.

Outstanding domestic debt of the central

government increased to 60.6 per cent of GDP

at end 2020 from 45.5 per cent of GDP in 2019,

primarily reflecting the impact of increased

domestic financing. In nominal terms, domestic

debt increased significantly by 32.7 per cent

to Rs. 9,065.1 billion at end 2020 from Rs.

6,830.3 billion at end 2019. Of the total domestic

debt, the share of short term debt increased to

24.2 per cent at end 2020 from 18.6 per cent at end

2019 mainly due to the increase in the outstanding

stock of Treasury bills. The outstanding stock

of Treasury bills increased by 85.4 per cent to

Rs. 1,620.7 billion by end 2020, from Rs. 873.9

billion by end 2019. The outstanding balance

of Treasury bonds continued to dominate the

domestic debt portfolio, accounting for a share

of 63.0 per cent (Rs. 5,713.3 billion) at end 2020

in comparison to 67.4 per cent (Rs. 4,606.2

billion) at end 2019. The outstanding stock of Sri

Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) declined to

Rs. 486.9 billion at end 2020 from Rs. 559.3 billion

at end 2019, while the outstanding balance of debt

to Rs. 227.4 billon at end 2020, compared to

outstanding debt from the banking sector, which

accounted for 52.2 per cent of domestic debt,

increased substantially by 64.0 per cent to

Rs. 4,735.7 billion, compared to Rs. 2,888.5

increase in the outstanding debt held by the

Central Bank and commercial banks. Domestic

by 9.8 per cent to Rs. 4,329.3 billion from

Outstanding foreign central government debt

declined to 40.4 per cent of GDP at end 2020,

from 41.3 per cent of GDP at end 2019, reflecting

mainly the impact of net repayments of foreign

debt amidst limited access to foreign financing

in 2020. In nominal terms, the outstanding foreign

central government debt declined to Rs. 6,052.2

billion at end 2020, compared to Rs. 6,201.3 billion

at end 2019. The outstanding non concessional debt,

including commercial foreign borrowings, decreased

by 10.8 per cent to Rs. 3,064.1 billion at end 2020

from Rs. 3,433.8 billion at end 2019. The share of

non concessional debt in total foreign debt declined

to 50.6 per cent at end 2020 from 55.4 per cent at

end 2019. This decline in non concessional debt was

mainly due to the repayment of foreign commercial

borrowings during the year, including the settlement

of the ISB of US dollars 1.0 billion in October

2020. The outstanding balance of concessional

debt in total foreign central government debt

increased by 8.0 per cent to Rs. 2,988.1 billion from

Rs. 2,767.5 billion at end 2019 and accounted for 49.4

per cent of total foreign debt at end 2020, compared

to 44.6 per cent at end 2019.

The parity impact on outstanding foreign

currency denominated central government

debt, resulting from the variation of the Sri

Lankan rupee against the debt denominated

foreign currencies, increased the rupee value

of the outstanding central government debt by

Rs. 355.7 billion by end 2020. This consisted of

Rs. 329.9 billion due to the parity change on the

outstanding foreign debt and Rs. 25.8 billion due to

parity change on the outstanding foreign currency

denominated domestic debt. The depreciation of the

Sri Lankan rupee against the US dollar by 2.6 per

cent mainly contributed to the parity impact by end

2020. In general, the impact of the depreciation of the

rupee on the outstanding foreign currency debt would

be of nominal importance, as the debt denominated

in foreign currency is usually serviced using foreign

currency inflows to the Government. However, it

must be noted that amidst the decline in foreign

exchange inflows to the Government in 2020 due to

the pandemic, the Government utilised a substantial

amount of rupee funds to purchase foreign exchange

from the Central Bank for debt servicing purposes

in 2020.

Central Government Debt Service Payments

Total debt service payments of the central

government decreased in 2020 to Rs. 1,941.4

billion from Rs. 2,022.5 billion in 2019, due to

the decline in amortisation payments, despite

the increase in interest payments. Domestic debt

repayments declined by 16.6 per cent to Rs. 455.9

billion in 2020 from Rs. 546.3 billion in 2019, mainly

due to the decline in Treasury bond maturities.

Foreign debt repayments declined by 12.1 per cent to

Rs. 505.2 billion in 2020 from Rs. 574.8 billion in 2019,

mainly reflecting the ISB amounting to US dollars 1,000

million matured in 2020 as against the ISB maturities

of US dollars 1,500 million in 2019. Consequently,

total amortisation payments, which accounted for

49.5 per cent of total debt service payments, declined

by 14.3 per cent to Rs. 961.1 billion in 2020 from Rs.

1,121.2 billion in 2019. In contrast, interest payments

on central government debt increased by 8.8 per cent

to Rs. 980.3 billion in 2020 from Rs. 901.4 billion in

2019 due to the increase in interest payments on

both domestic and foreign outstanding debt. Interest

payments on central government domestic debt

increased by 6.9 per cent to Rs. 713.6 billion in 2020

from Rs. 667.4 billion in 2019, due to the notable

increase in outstanding domestic debt, despite the

decline in domestic interest rates, including yields on

government securities. Interest payments on foreign

debt rose to Rs. 266.7 billion in 2020 in comparison to

Rs. 234.0 billion in 2019, mainly due to the increase

in interest payments on ISBs, along with the impact

of the parity change. Overall, domestic debt service

payments declined to Rs. 1,169.5 billion from Rs.

1,213.7 billion in 2019, and foreign debt service

payments declined by 4.6 per cent to Rs. 771.9

billion during 2020 from Rs 808.8 billion in 2019.

Central government debt indicators showed

a mixed performance in 2020. Total debt service

payments declined to 13.0 per cent of GDP in

2020 from 13.5 per cent of GDP in the previous

year. Amortisation payments on domestic debt

as a percentage of GDP declined to 3.0 per cent

in 2020 from 3.5 per cent in 2019. Amortisation

payments on foreign debt declined to 3.4 per cent

of GDP in 2020 from 3.8 per cent of GDP in 2019.

However, total interest payments as a percentage

of GDP increased to 6.5 per cent in 2020 from 6.0

per cent in 2019. Interest payments on domestic

debt increased to 4.8 per cent of GDP in 2020

from 4.4 per cent of GDP in 2019, on account of

the increase in outstanding domestic debt, despite

the notable decline in domestic interest rates,

especially the yields on government securities.

Interest payments on foreign debt increased to

1.8 per cent of GDP in 2020 from 1.6 per cent of

GDP in the previous year. The ratio of foreign debt

service payments to exports of goods and services

rose to 31.9 per cent in 2020 from 23.3 per cent

in 2019, due to the decline in exports of goods

and services in 2020 over the previous year, thus

outweighing the impact of the decline of foreign

debt service payments in 2020 over the previous

year. Meanwhile, the ratio of central government

debt service payments to government revenue

worsened to 141.9 per cent in 2020 from 107.0 per

cent in 2019, reflecting mainly the notable decline

in government revenue in 2020.

Outstanding Public Debt

The outstanding public debt, which includes

central government debt, foreign project loans

received by SOBEs,8 and public guaranteed

debt, increased substantially to 109.7 per cent

of GDP by end 2020 from 94.3 per cent of GDP

at end 2019. This increase was mainly due to the

rise in central government debt coupled with the

contraction in the nominal GDP in 2020. In absolute

terms, the outstanding public debt increased to

Rs. 16,427.1 billion at end 2020 from Rs. 14,155.3

billion at end 2019. The outstanding central

government debt, which is the largest component

of public debt, increased to Rs. 15,117.2 billion

at end 2020 from Rs. 13,031.5 billion at end

2019, accounting for 92.0 per cent of the total

public debt. Public guaranteed debt increased by

26.7 per cent to Rs. 986.4 billion at end 2020 from

Rs. 778.3 billion at end 2019, and accounted for

6.0 per cent of total outstanding public debt.

However, outstanding debt relating to foreign

project loans received by SOBEs declined to

Rs. 323.5 billion at end 2020 from Rs. 345.5 billion

at end 2019 due to the repayment of outstanding

loans by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and

the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) during 2020.

The SLPA and the CEB were the major holders

of SOBE debt, accounting for 50.9 per cent and

42.3 per cent, respectively, at end 2020.

6.5 Budgetary Operations in Sub

National Governments

Policy Directions and Measures taken by Sub National Governments

In 2020, sub national governments,9 which

consist of Provincial Councils (PCs) and

Local Government (LGs), continued to develop

8 Foreign project loans received by SOBEs without public guarantee.9 By end of 2020, the sub national governments consisted of nine PCs and 341 LGs, which comprised 24 Municipal Councils, 41 Urban Councils and 276 Pradeshiya Sabhas.

infrastructure facilities, despite disruptions from

the COVID-19 pandemic. During the year, the Local

Government Enhancement Sector Project, ‘Pura

Neguma’, the Local Development Support Project, the

Greater Colombo Waste Water Management Project,

and several road development projects progressed,

thereby enhancing the economic infrastructure

of the country. The Primary Health Care System

Strengthening Project and the General Education

Modernisation Project also continued, aimed at

upgrading social infrastructure at sub national level.

In 2020, the Finance Commission (FC)

effected several policy recommendations

to foster a balanced regional development

in the country via sound public investment

implementation and delivery of services at sub

national level. The FC recommended to establish

a common framework for decision making in the

national and sub national governments, while

disbursing funds directly to the PCs for development

activities. The FC recommended providing a special

capital grant to the PCs for environmental protection

activities, while discontinuing the allocations made

to line ministries for such activities, as most activities

were carried out through PCs and local authorities.

Further, the Commission recommended empowering

the PCs and LGs by recognising new avenues for

revenue generation in order to lessen the burden on

the central government budget.

Budgetary Operations in Provincial Councils

Revenue collection of PCs declined notably in

2020, compared to 2019, reflecting the impact of

the moderation of activity amidst the pandemic.

Total revenue of PCs declined to Rs. 52.2 billion

in 2020 from Rs. 91.3 billion in 2019. Tax revenue

declined to Rs. 43.1 billion in 2020 from Rs. 81.5

billion in 2019, reflecting a significant decline in NBT

revenue transferred from the Central Government

to Rs. 2.7 billion in 2020 from Rs. 34.9 billion in

on personal emoluments. Accordingly, personal

emoluments increased to Rs. 240.0 billion in 2020

from Rs. 219.7 billion in 2019, continuing to be the

largest item in the recurrent expenditure accounting

for 76.9 per cent of the total recurrent expenditure

of PCs. The education and health sectors absorbed

around 90 per cent of personal emoluments of

PCs. Meanwhile, capital expenditure increased to

Rs. 24.9 billion in 2020 from Rs. 23.2 billion in 2019,

despite the decline in expenditure on acquisition

of capital goods, capital transfers and Province

Specific Development Projects (PSDPs). Among

the high spending PCs in 2020, the Western, the

Central and the Southern PCs accounted for 23.3

per cent, 12.3 per cent, and 11.9 per cent of total

recurrent expenditure of PCs, respectively.

Transfers from the Central Government to

PCs increased notably during the year 2020.

The central government transfers increased to

Rs. 284.8 billion in 2020 from Rs. 218.8 billion in

2019, mainly due to the increase in block grants

amidst the decline in grants for Province Specific

Development Grants (PSDGs) and Criteria

Based Grants (CBGs). As a percentage of GDP,

transfers from the Central Government increased to

1.9 per cent in 2020 from 1.5 per cent in 2019. Block

grants, the major form of central government transfers

to PCs, amounted to Rs. 265.6 billion, representing

93.3 per cent of the total transfers, which were

provided to meet the resource gap in the recurrent

expenditure programme of PCs. In addition, grants

for special projects increased to Rs. 6.4 billion in

2020 from Rs. 5.2 billion in 2019. The transfers under

PSDGs and CBGs amounted to Rs. 11.0 billion and

Rs. 1.8 billion, respectively. During the year, 84.5

per cent of expenditure of PCs was financed through

central government transfers, compared to 70.5

per cent in 2019, reflecting an increased reliance

of PCs on the central government budget due to

the substantially low revenue mobilisation of PCs

during 2020.

2019. The share of revenue from NBT declined

to 6.3 per cent in 2020 from 42.8 per cent in 2019.

Tax on property, which continued to be the key

source of revenue of PCs, was reported at Rs. 27.4

billion in 2020 compared to Rs. 32.4 billion in 2019.

Meanwhile, non tax revenue declined marginally to

Rs. 9.1 billion in 2020 from Rs. 9.8 billion in 2019. The

share of revenue of the Western Provincial Council

of the total revenue collection by all PCs declined to

46.8 per cent in 2020 from 49.2 per cent in 2019

due to the COVID-19 related mobility restrictions,

which was a more significant hinderance to

economic activities in the Western Province in

comparison to other provinces. Of the revenue

collection by the other PCs, the North Western and

Southern Provinces accounted for 10.8 per cent and

10.5 per cent of the total revenue, respectively.

The total expenditure of PCs increased

mainly due to the increase in recurrent

expenditure in 2020. In nominal terms, total

expenditure increased to Rs. 337.0 billion in 2020

from Rs. 310.1 billion in 2019, while as a percentage

of GDP, it increased to 2.3 per cent in 2020 from

2.1 per cent in 2019. Recurrent expenditure

increased to Rs. 312.1 billion in 2020 from Rs. 286.9

billion in 2019, mainly due to the rise in expenditure
