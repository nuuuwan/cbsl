Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020Part II - 4

The Central Bank was established as the authority responsible for the administration, supervision and regulation of the monetary, financial and payment systems of Sri Lanka under the Monetary Law Act. In accordance with this Act, the Bank is charged with the responsibility of securing the core objectives of economic and price stability and financial system stability.

The basis of accountability for the Central Bank and the success of its operations therefore would be the effectiveness of its policies and operations leading towards the achievement of its core objectives and not necessarily its profitability. These statutory objectives are the fundamental features that distinguish the Central Bank from any other entity, private or public. Accordingly, profitability related approach, if adopted by the Central Bank, could result in the Bank pursuing profits while compromising its core objectives, since it has the unique ability to create its own profits through its monetary policy activities, which could influence interest rates and exchange rates. It therefore

Central Bank of Sri LankaManagement StatementFor the period ended 31 December 2020

Accountability and the Financial Performance of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in relation to the Objectives

follows that the Central Bank’s objectives of economic and price stability and financial system stability need to be distinguished and detached from the pure profitability objective which should essentially be incidental or academic only.

In this background, the Central Bank’s financial statements record gains and/or deficits in the implementation of its monetary policy operations, exchange rate management, issuing of currency, etc. at the values as realized and hence, the financial performance as reported in these statements needs to be interpreted and understood in that context.

The Bank is subject to an external audit by the Auditor General under the Monetary Law Act sections 42 & 43. The Auditor General in turn has obtained the services of a firm of Chartered Accountants, M/s KPMG, to carry out an audit under International Standards of Auditing to ensure compliance with the International Financial Reporting Standards.

The Bank is primarily responsible for the administration, supervision, regulation of monetary, financial and payment system of Sri Lanka and also acts as the fiscal agent of the Government. The activities of the bank mainly include:

• Implementing monetary and exchange rate

polices. • Issuing of currency. • Management of the official international reserves • Oversight of the financial system • Licensing, regulating and supervising of Banks

and selected Non-Bank Financial Institutions • Provision of settlement facilities and the

regulation of the payment system. • Compilation, dissemination and analysis of

economic data and statistics. • Providing loans and advances to the Government,

bank and financial institutions under various facilities. • Banker to the Government and its agencies, and

provision of current account facilities to LCBs and non-commercial bank primary dealers for Government securities. The activities carried out in order to achieve its objective of economic, price and financial system stability with a view to encouraging and promoting the development of the productive resources of Sri Lanka can be broadly segregated into foreign currency and local currency

activities. Results of these activities are taken to Operating Activities in the context of the Statement of Income.

2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2.1 Statement of Compliance

These financial statements of the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2020 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

2.2 Basis of Measurement

The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the following,

• Gold is measured at fair value through profit or

loss (FVTPL).

• Derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) are measured at fair value.

• Land and buildings are measured at cost at the

time of acquisition and subsequently at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

• Liability for defined benefit obligations is

measured as the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the plan assets.

2.3 Reporting Format

The Bank presents financial assets and financial liabilities, and their associated income and expense streams, by distinguishing between foreign currency and local currency operations. In the Statement of Financial Position, assets and liabilities are presented broadly in order of liquidity within such distinguished categories. The Bank considers that this reporting approach provides appropriate reporting of the Bank’s activities which are more fully described in Note 7.

2.4 Functional and Presentation Currency

The Financial Statements are presented in Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR), which is the Bank’s functional currency. Financial information presented in Sri Lankan Rupees has been rounded to the nearest thousand. There was no change in the Bank’s presentation and functional currency during the year under review.

2.5 Materiality and Aggregation

Each material class of similar item is presented separately in the Financial Statements. Items of dissimilar nature

Central Bank of Sri LankaNotes to the Financial Statements

For the year ended 31 December 2020

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020Part II - 14

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

or function are presented separately unless they are immaterial.

2.6 Offsetting

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in Statement of Financial Position when, and only when, the Bank has a legal right to set off the recognized amounts and it intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

2.7 Comparative Information

The comparative information is reclassified whenever necessary to conform with the current year’s presentation.

3. USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

The preparation of the Bank’s financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities.

Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively. Information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognized in the Financial Statements are described in the following notes.

3.1 Classification and Impairment of Financial Assets

The Bank used judgements when assessing of the business model within which the assets are held and whether the contractual terms of the financial assets are solely-payment-of-principal-and-interest (SPPI) on the principal amount of the outstanding. The Bank also used judgements when establishing the criteria for determining whether credit risk on the financial assets has increased significantly since initial recognition, determining methodology for incorporating forward looking information into measurement of Expected Credit Losses (ECL) and selection and approval of models to measure ECL. The implications of COVID-19 on the use of estimates and judgements in the computation of Bank’s expected credit losses are explained in Note 3.4.

3.2 Pensions and Other Post Employment Benefit Plans

The cost of defined benefit plans is determined using an actuarial valuation. The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about discount rates, future

compensation increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. Assumptions used in the actuarial valuation are disclosed in Note 32 to the Financial Statements.

3.3 Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Where the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the Statement of Financial Position cannot be derived from active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. The inputs to these models are derived from observable market data where possible, but if this is not available, judgment is required to establish fair values. The judgments include considerations of liquidity and model inputs such as volatility for longer–dated derivatives. The implications of COVID-19 on the use of estimates and judgements in fair valuing the new loan schemes granted during the year 2020 are explained in Note 3.4.

3.4 General Implications of COVID-19

The Bank considered the impact of COVID-19 in preparing the financial statements. While the specific areas of judgement have not changed, the impact of COVID-19 resulted in application of additional judgement and estimates mainly in relation to loans to bank balance and the expected credit loss assessment in the financial statements.

CBSL implemented a range of relief and policy measures to revive the economy which was affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Among those, the most significant relief measure which had financial implication on the Bank’s financial statements were the new loan schemes implemented. Accordingly, the Bank launched new refinance and credit schemes through LCBs and LSBs under the names Saubagya COVID-19 Renaissance Phase I, II, III and Liquidity Facility to the Construction Sector at concessionary interest rates with maturity terms ranging from 6 months to 2 years with the condition of lending by LCBs and LSBs to businesses affected by the pandemic. The fair value is determined by using valuation techniques that involve use of unobservable inputs and judgment, particularly with respect to ensuring that the valuation techniques and inputs are relevant and appropriate. As such, critical assumptions and judgments were used in the determination of the repayment terms and the market interest rate used in arriving at the initial recognition fair value of the said loan schemes.

Though the fundamental credit loss model mechanics and methodology underpinning the Bank’s calculation of expected credit losses have remained consistent with prior periods, the Bank has captured the impact of COVID-19 through the expected credit loss model inputs, assumptions and forward-looking macroeconomic variables used in the computation process. In addition,

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020Part II - 15

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

the Bank used calibrations in the forward looking macro-economic data used in the expected credit loss model to avoid unprecedented statistical variations caused by the movements in the macro- economic data resulting from COVID-19.

However, for non-financial assets, the Bank’s assessment is that COVID-19 related conditions had no impact on the carrying values and was appropriately assessed in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020.

4. CHANGES TO SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

There were no changes to the accounting policies and accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.

5. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

5.1 Foreign Currency Translations and Balances

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to Sri Lankan Rupees at the rate of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated to Sri Lankan Rupees at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date. The foreign currency translation gain or loss on monetary items are taken to the Statement of Income. For the purposes of retranslation, as at the reporting date, the following Sri Lankan Rupee exchange rates for major currencies were used:

Currency2020Rs.2019Rs. 1 Australian Dollar143.4225127.53431 Canadian Dollar146.4840139.82061 Euro227.7256203.65711 Japanese Yen1.80551.67241 Special Drawing Rights (SDR)272.6200250.78871 Sterling Pound254.8200240.79221 United States Dollar186.4082181.6341 Chinese Yuan (Offshore)28.666126.0905

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

5.2 Fair Value Measurement

The Bank measures financial instruments, such as, foreign securities, derivatives, and non-financial assets such as Gold, at fair value at each reporting date. The fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in Note 50.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

• In the principal market for the asset or liability, or • In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability

The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Bank.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The Bank uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilitiesLevel 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Bank determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

5.3 Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

The Bank presents financial assets and liabilities, and the associated income and expense streams, by distinguishing between foreign currency and local currency activities.

Foreign currency activities mainly arise from the Bank’s foreign reserves management function. Local currency

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020Part II - 16

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

activities mainly reflect the assets and liabilities associated with monetary policy implementation, issuing currency and banking activities.

The separate reporting of these activities is considered to provide a better presentation of the Bank’s financial position, financial performance and risk profile. The Bank considers that the combined reporting of foreign and local currency activities would weaken the informational value of the financial statements.

5.3.1 Recognition and Initial Measurement

All financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and including acquisition charges associated with the investment. All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the trade date respectively. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the market place.

5.3.2 Classification

Financial Assets

On initial recognition, Bank classifies the financial assets as measured at;

• Amortized Cost • Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income

(FVOCI) • Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)

A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL

• The asset is held within a business model whose

objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and

• The contractual terms of the financial asset give

rise on specified dates to cashflows that are Solely Payment of Principle and Interest.

A financial asset is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL.

• The asset is held within a business model whose

objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and

• The contractual terms of the financial asset give

rise on specified dates to cashflows that are Solely Payment of Principle and Interest.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. All other financial assets are classified as measured at FVTPL.

Business Model Assessment

The Bank makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The information considered includes but not limited to:

• How the performance of the business model and

the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the entity’s key management personnel.

• The risks that affect the performance of the

business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed.

• The frequency, volume and timing of sales in

prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realized.

Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

Assessment of whether Contractual Cash Flows are Solely Payments of Principal and Interest

The Bank assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. For the purpose of this assessment, “Principal” is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and “Interest” is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs.

The most significant elements of interest within a lending arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Bank applies judgement and considers relevant factors such as the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interest rate is set.

In contrast, contractual terms that introduce a more than the minimum exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that are unrelated to a basic lending arrangement do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the amount outstanding. In such cases, the financial asset is required to be measured at FVTPL.

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

Reclassifications

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the Bank changes its business model for managing financial assets.

5.3.3 Derecognition

Financial Assets

Bank derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised) and the sum of (i) the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI is recognised in profit or loss.

Any cumulative gain/loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated as at FVOCI is not recognised in profit or loss on derecognition of such securities. Any interest in transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Bank is recognised as a separate asset or liability.

The Bank enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognized on its Statement of Financial Position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets or a portion of them. In such cases, the transferred assets are not derecognized. Examples of such transactions are securities lending and sale-and-repurchase transactions. In transactions in which the Bank neither retains nor transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset and it retains control over the asset, the Bank continues to recognize the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset.

Financial Liabilities

The Bank derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired.

5.3.4 Impairment of Financial Assets

The Bank recognizes loss allowances for ECL on the following financial instruments that are not measured at FVTPL:

• Financial assets at Fair Value through Other

Comprehensive Income

• Financial Assets at Amortized Cost

• Credit guarantee contracts of Regional Development

Department

No impairment loss is recognized on equity investments.

The Bank measures loss allowances at an amount equal to 12 months ECL for investments which are in investment grade (rated Baa3/BBB- and above). Majority of the investments of the Bank which are classified as Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income and Amortized Cost are above Baa3/BBB- rate. Financial instruments for which a 12-month ECL is recognised are referred to as “Stage 1 financial instruments”.

Life time ECL is calculated for those instruments which are below the investment grade at initial recognition or whose credit risk deteriorates below Baa3/BBB- or when a doubling of the probability of default has occurred after initial recognition. Financial instruments for which a lifetime ECL is recognised but which are not credit-impaired are referred to as “Stage 2 financial instruments”. Life time ECL would also be computed for credit impaired assets which would be referred to as “Stage 3 financial instruments”.

Measurement of ECL

The mechanism of the ECL calculations are outlined below with the key elements.

Probability of Default (PD): The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognized and is still in the portfolio. The Bank uses specific equity PD’s of issuers/counterparties from Bloomberg for all its foreign investments at FVOCI and amortized cost and in the absence of equity PDs, the PD’s applicable to the rating of the specific issuer/counterparty from the Bloomberg common PD table at a given reporting date.

Exposure at Default: The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected draw downs on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments.

Loss Given Default (LGD): The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. The Bank has an approved internal policy in applying the LGD for different types

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020Part II - 18

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

of Financial Assets based on their risk exposure to the Bank.

Economic Factor Adjustment: Bank uses the Economic Factor Adjustment for the conversion of through the cycle PD to point in time PD and the Bank mainly uses GDP data as the main economic factor in stimulating the PD.

Assessing the Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR)

Bank will consider that the financial instruments have Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) when doubling of PD has occurred from initial recognition and any rating downgrade below BBB- after initial recognition. This is based on the observation that all ratings downgrades from an investment grade rating to a non-investment grade rating, including the marginal one notch downgrade from Baa3 to Ba1, results in a two-fold or greater increase of PD.

Credit-impaired financial assets

At each reporting date, the Bank assesses whether financial assets carried at amortized cost, at FVOCI, and credit guarantees are credit-impaired (referred to as “Stage 3 financial assets”). A financial asset is “credit-impaired” when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

• significant financial difficulty of the borrower or

issuer;• a breach of contract such as a default or past due

event;• it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter

bankruptcy or other financial reorganization

Presentation of allowance for ECL in the Statement of Financial Position

Loss allowances for ECL are presented in the Statement of Financial Position as follows:

• Financial assets measured at amortised cost: as a

deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets;• Investments measured at FVOCI: no loss allowance

is recognised in the Statement of Financial Position because the carrying amount of these assets is their fair value. However, the loss allowance is disclosed and is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. • Credit guarantee contracts: generally, as a provision.

Write-off

Loans and debt securities are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when the Bank

determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment is carried out at the individual asset level. Recoveries of amounts previously written off are included in “impairment losses on financial instruments” in the Statement of Income and OCI.

5.4 Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss

Financial assets classified as held for trading are included in the category “securities at fair value through profit or loss”. Upon initial recognition, attributable transaction cost are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. These securities are subsequently valued at quoted market prices. Changes in market values are recognised as an increase or decrease in the value of the securities in the Statement of Financial Position while resulting gains and losses are recognised in the Statement of Income.

Where the security is still owned, the gain or loss is reported as “Gain/(Loss) from Unrealised Price Revaluations”. Where the gain or loss has been realised (through selling the security), it is reported as “Gain / (Loss) from Realised Price Revaluations”.

5.5 Financial Assets at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income

Investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income are non-derivative investments that are designated as Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income or are not classified as another category of financial assets. Investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income comprise of equity securities and debt securities.

Foreign Currency debt securities at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income are subsequently valued at quoted market prices. Changes in market value are recognized as an increase or decrease in the value of the Investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income in the Statement of Financial Position.

The equity investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income are subsequently valued based on the Net Assets of the respective institutions due to the non-availability of quoted prices.

Gains and losses arising from changes in the market value of Foreign and Local Currency debt securities and Equity Investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income are recognised directly in equity (Other Comprehensive Income) which is shown under Other Reserves in the Statement of Financial Position until the investment is sold, collected or otherwise disposed of, or until the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported as equity is included in Statement of Income with the exception of fair value changes in equity investments

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020Part II - 19

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

which will not be recycled to Statement of Income upon derecognition. Interest income is recognised in Statement of Income using the effective interest method.

5.6 Instruments held at Amortized Cost

The items that are held within the business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cashflows and the contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specific dates that are solely principle and interest are classified as instruments held at amortized cost. These instruments are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

5.7 Derivative Instruments

The Bank uses derivatives such as cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts for risk management purposes and not for speculative purposes. Derivatives are recorded at fair value and carried as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are included in “Gain/(Loss) from Unrealized Price Revaluations”.

When the transaction price differs from the fair value of other observable current market transactions in the same instrument, or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets, the Bank immediately recognises the difference between the transaction price and fair value (a Day 1 difference) in “Gain/(Loss) from Unrealized Price Revaluations”. In cases where fair value is determined using data which is not observable, the difference between the transaction price and model value is only recognised in the Statement of Income when inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised.

5.8 International Monetary Fund (IMF) Related Balances

The Bank transacts with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its own right rather than as the depository of the Government of Sri Lanka. All transactions by the bank with the IMF have been included in these financial statements on that basis.

The Bank records the quota with the IMF as an asset and the amount payable to the IMF for quota is recorded as a liability of the Bank. The cumulative allocation of SDRs by the IMF is treated as a liability. The IMF quota asset and the SDR holding is classified as FVTPL while other IMF related assets and liabilities are recognized at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Exchange gains and losses arising on revaluation of IMF assets and liabilities at the exchange rate applying at reporting date as published by the IMF are recognised in the Statement of Income.

All other charges and interest pertaining to balances with the IMF are recorded immediately in the Statement of Income.

5.9 Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at foreign banks and financial institutions, short-term deposits and highly liquid financial assets with original maturities of less than three months, which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in their fair value and are used by the Bank in the management of its short-term commitments and cash equivalents are carried at amortized cost in the Statement of Financial Position.

As a part of local currency activities CBSL generates certain income and incurs expenses, which do not involve in movement of cash. Those activities result in certain assets and liabilities and mainly comprise of the transactions with the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) and transactions with domestic banks and financial institutions. Transactions with GOSL include the purchase of Treasury bills and bonds that are issued by the Government as a monetary policy mechanism. Such purchases, disposals or interest thereon are reflected as mere book entries in the records of CBSL. These are disclosed separately in Note 45 and Note 46 to the Financial Statements.

As the sole statutory authority, CBSL issues currency to the public in line with Monetary Law Act. Currency issued by CBSL represents a claim on the bank in favor of the holder. This is a liability on the part of the CBSL while it is an item of cash in the hands of the holder.

Movement in circulation currency is included as part of financing activities in line with prevailing industry practices among those central banks which present cash flow statements.

CBSL through the cash/pay order process disburses cash in the form of notes and coins or cheques drawn on CBSL, to various drawees including suppliers and employees for goods and services obtained, which is either added to the currency in circulation liability or deposits by banks and financial institutions. Such forms of utilization of currency for the purposes of CBSL’s payments form part of cash outflows of CBSL.

For the purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of cash/ pay order outflows.

5.10 Repurchase and Reverse-Repurchase Transactions

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase continue to be recorded as assets in the Statement of Financial Position. The obligation to repurchase (Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase) is recognised as a liability. The difference between the sale and repurchase price in repurchase transactions and the purchase price and sale price in reverse-repurchase transactions represents an expense and income respectively and recognised in the Statement of Income.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020Part II - 20

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

Securities held under reverse-repurchase agreements are recorded as an asset in the Statement of Financial Position (Securities Purchased under Resale Agreements). Both repurchase and reverse-repurchase transactions are reported at amortized cost inclusive of any accrued income or expense.

5.11 Standing Deposit and Lending Facilities

With effect from 1 February 2014, Standing Deposit Facility (former Standing Repurchase (Repo) Facility) was converted in to a ‘clean deposit’ with no allocation of collateral. Hence, participating institutions invest their excess funds in the Standing Deposit Facility as a clean deposit on daily basis at standing deposit facility rate.

The procedures of Standing Lending Facility (Formerly Standing Reverse Repurchase (Reverse Repo) Facility) are identical to the Standing Reverse Repurchase Facility and both are recognized at amortized cost in the Statement of Financial Position.

5.12 CBSL Securities

The Bank issues CBSL Securities from time to time under its Monetary Policy operations to absorb excess liquidity in the market. The securities issued are recorded as a liability.

5.13 Sri Lanka Government Securities

Sri Lanka Government Securities consists of Treasury Bills and Bonds purchased from GOSL. Investments in Sri Lanka Government Securities is recorded in the Statement of Financial Position at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income.

5.14 Provisional Advances to Government

Advances to Government represents direct provisional advances made to GOSL under Section 89 of the Monetary Law Act No.58 of 1949 of Sri Lanka, as amended. These advances are subsequently measured at amortized cost.

5.15 Loans to Other Institutions

Loans granted to Other Institutions are recognized and carried at amortized cost.

5.16 Securities Borrowings and Securities Lending

Bank borrows Government Securities from time to time under its monetary policy operations from major institutional investors. The borrowed securities are used by the bank for repurchase operations to absorb excess liquidity in the market.

The securities borrowings is an unconditional blanket guarantee from the Bank for return of securities, payment of agreed fee and on compensation at market rate (as per the market rates communicated to the primary market

participants by the Public Debt Department of the Bank) in the events of any failure in delivery.

The market values of the securities borrowed and not used for the repurchase operations at a particular time are recorded as a contingent liability. The commission paid is expensed on accrual basis.

Transfer of securities to counterparties under lending transactions is only reflected on the Statement of Financial Position if the risks and rewards of ownership are also transferred.

5.17 Staff Loans

Bank employees are entitled to loan facilities under concessionary interest rates. These loans which were granted from 2008 onwards are fair valued as per IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” using discounted cash flows.

Discount rate - The rate compiled by the Economic Research Department of CBSL (ERD) based on the long term inflation target and the expected real interest rate over the respective time horizons plus 1 per cent added for the risk premium as agreed by the Advisory Audit Committee of the Bank is used as the discount rate and it varies with the period of the loans.

The difference between the present value of the staff loan as at the end of a year and beginning of the year have been amortized yearly to record the expense incurred by the Bank in providing these loans at concessionary rates and equivalent amount is recorded as other income to record the income that would have been earned by the bank if these loans were granted at market rates.

Assumptions used for computation of fair valuation

• The date of staff loan granted is considered as 1

January.• There were no amendments or early settlements.

5.18 Gold

Section 67 (1) of the Monetary Law Act which specifies the composition of the International Reserve indicates that gold may be held by the CBSL as part of this Reserve. According to Section 67(2), Monetary Board is required to endeavor to hold at least a nuclear reserve in gold or currencies freely convertible by the Central Bank, whether directly or indirectly, in to gold as per the MLA. As this gold is part of the International Reserve and not used as a commodity which is traded during the normal course of business, gold is fair valued and the gains or losses are transferred to the Statement of Income. Prior to appropriation of profits, the unrealised gains from gold are transferred to the relevant reserve account.

5.19 Currency Inventory

Inventories of the Bank include new currencies that are not yet issued to the circulation. Cost related to production and design of new currency notes and coins are initially

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020Part II - 21

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

recognized at cost. Cost of new currency notes and coins which are issued to the circulation is determined on a weighted average basis and at the time of issue it is charged to Statement of Income. Allowance is made for slow moving inventories.

5.20 Other Inventories

Other inventories are carried at lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis.

5.21 Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, Plant and Equipment excluding land & building are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment in value. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of such Property, Plant and Equipment when that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met.

Land and buildings are measured at revalued amount, being their fair value at the date of revaluation, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

Except for the freehold land, depreciation is calculated on a straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives.

Class of AssetUseful Life

Buildings on Freehold LandsOver 50 Years

Buildings on Leasehold LandLower of 50 years or over the lease term

Plant & Plant Integrals 20 Years Furniture & Equipment10 Years Motor Vehicles5 Years Motor Vehicles acquired 2014 onwards10 YearsComputer Hardware 4 Years Others3 Years

The carrying values of Property, Plant and Equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

Policy for revaluation of Land & Building of the Bank is at least once in three years or at any shorter interval when a significant valuation adjustment becomes evident. Any revaluation surplus is credited to the Revaluation Reserve included in the equity section of the Statement of Financial Position, except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognized in Statement of Income, in which case the increase is recognized in Statement of Income. A revaluation deficit is recognized in Statement of Income, except that a deficit directly offsetting a previous surplus on the same asset is directly offset against the surplus in the Revaluation Reserve. Upon disposal, any revaluation surplus relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings.

An item of Property, Plant and Equipment is de-recognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the Statement of Income in the year the asset is de-recognized. The asset’s residual values, useful lives and methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, regularly.

Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost. These are expenses of a capital nature directly incurred in the construction of buildings, major plant and machinery and system development, awaiting capitalization.

5.22 Leases

At inception of a contract, the Bank assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange of consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Bank uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16.

Bank acting as a lessee

The Bank recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjustment for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove any improvements made to the lands or office premises.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain re-measurements of the lease liability.

The liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicated in the lease or if that rate cannot be determined, the Bank’s incremental borrowing rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:

• Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;

• Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a

rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;

• Amounts expected to be payable under a residual value

guarantee; and

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020Part II - 22

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

• Exercise price under a purchase option that the Bank

is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Bank is reasonably certain not to terminate early.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Bank’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Bank changes its assessment of whether it will exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in Statement of Income if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

The Bank presents right-of-use assets in “Property Plant and Equipment” (Note 20) and lease liabilities in “Miscellaneous Liabilities and Accruals” (Note 33) in the Statement of Financial Position.

5.23 Intangible Assets

Computer software not integral to computer hardware are shown as intangible assets and recognized at cost. Following initial recognition these intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment. Subsequent expenditure on software assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.

Amortisation is recognised in Statement of Income on a straight-line basis over the useful life of 4 years, from the date that it is available for use since this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.

5.24 Other Assets

Other assets are carried at expected realisable values.

5.25 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets

The Bank assesses at each end of reporting period if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired, whether there is an indication that a non-financial asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the bank makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in Statement of Income.

At each reporting date, the Bank reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to determine whether

there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.

For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that is largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets.

The ‘recoverable amount’ of an asset is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. ‘Value in use’ is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.

Impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

5.26 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Bank expects a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.

5.27 Currency in Circulation

Currency issued by the Bank represents a claim on the bank in favour of the holder. The liability for Currency in Circulation is recorded at face value in the Statement of Financial Position.

5.28 Defined Benefit Plans

A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. Bank operates defined benefit schemes for Pension, Widows’ and Orphans’ Pensions (W&OP), Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pensions (WR&OP), Retirement Gratuity and Post Employment Medical Benefits. The Bank and eligible beneficiaries make contributions, to separately administered funds in respect of the first three schemes.

The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. The Bank’s obligation in respect of defined benefit plan is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Any unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the valuation date on Government Bonds that have

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020Part II - 23

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

maturity dates approximating to the average remaining years of service. All principal actuarial assumptions disclosed in Note 32 are revised annually.

5.29 Defined Contribution Plans

Employees are eligible for Employees’ Provident Fund Contributions and Employees’ Trust Fund Contributions in line with respective statutes and regulations. The bank contributes 24% and 3% of employees’ gross emoluments to Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund respectively which are separately administered defined contribution plans.

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as expense in the Statement of Income as and when they are due.

5.30 Grants

Grants recognised at their fair value (where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions, if any, will be complied with) are shown under equity. When the grant relates to an expense item it is recognised in the Statement of Income over the periods necessary to match them to the expenses it is intended to compensate on a systematic basis. Where the grant relates to an asset, the fair value is credited to a deferred government grant account and is released to the Statement of Income over the expected useful life of the relevant asset on a systematic basis consistent with the depreciation policy of the related asset.

5.31 Contingent Liabilities and Commitments

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events or present obligations where the transfer of economic benefit is not probable or cannot be reliably measured. All guarantees of indebtedness, forward foreign exchange transactions and other commitments, which are not recognized in Statement of Financial Position, are shown under respective headings disclosed as Contingent Liabilities and Capital Commitments items. Where applicable, such amounts are measured at best estimates.

STATEMENT OF PROFIT OR LOSS AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

5.32 Revenue and Expenses

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Bank and the revenue can be reliably measured. Expenses are recognised in the Statement of Income on the basis of a direct association between the cost incurred and the earning of specific items of income. All expenditure incurred in the running of the business and in maintaining the property, plant & equipment in a state of efficiency has been charged to income in arriving at the result for the year.

The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue and expenses are recognised:

5.32.1 Interest Income and Expenses

Interest income and expense are recognised in the Statement of Income for all interest bearing instruments on an accrual basis using the effective yield method based on the actual purchase price unless collectability is in doubt. Interest income includes coupons earned on fixed income investments and securities and accrued discount and premium on treasury bills and other discounted instruments. Interest income is suspended when loans become doubtful of collection. Such income is excluded from interest income until received.

5.32.2 Dividends

Dividend income is recognized when the Bank’s right to receive the payment is established.

5.32.3 Miscellaneous Income and Expenses

Miscellaneous income and expenses are recognised on an accrual basis.

Net gains and losses of a revenue nature on the disposal of Property, Plant & Equipment have been accounted for in the Statement of Income, having deducted from proceeds on disposal, the carrying amount of the assets and related selling expenses.

Gains and losses arising from incidental activities to the main revenue generating activities and those arising from a group of similar transactions which are not material, are aggregated, reported and presented on a net basis.

5.32.4 Personnel Expenses

Personnel expenses include the full cost of all staff benefits. Salaries and related expenses due at year-end are included in other local payables.

5.32.5 Income Tax Expense

The income of the Bank is exempted from tax under section 118 of the Monetary Law Act 58 of 1949 as amended and as per section 9 (1) of Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017. In terms of the Economic Service Charge (Amendment) Act No. 07 of 2017, the Bank is liable for ESC commencing from 01.04.2017. However, unrealized gain on exchange rate and unrealized marked to market gain on foreign currency financial assets are exempted from ESC with effect from October 2018 as per the ESC (Amendment) Act, No. 33 of 2018. Further, the Bank is exempted from Value Added Tax on supply of financial services as per Value Added Tax (Amendment) Act No.17 of 2013.

ESC was abolished with effect from 1 January 2020.

5.33 Events Occurring after the Reporting Date

All material subsequent events after the reporting date have been considered and where appropriate adjustments or disclosures have been made in the respective notes to the Financial Statements.

7. NATURE AND EXTENT OF ACTIVITIES

7.1 Foreign Currency Activities

Foreign currency activities result mainly from the CBSL’s holdings of foreign currency assets under its foreign reserves management function. The foreign reserves management portfolio comprises of foreign currency assets held for foreign exchange intervention purposes and other foreign currency assets held for trading purposes.

The foreign currency assets are held in various currencies. The majorities are denominated in United States Dollars, Australian Dollars, Euros, Sterling Pounds, Japanese Yen and New Zealand Dollars. The financial instruments held within these foreign currency portfolios consist mainly of sovereign securities, securities held under reverse-repurchase transactions or balances held with other central banks, commercial banks and custodial institutions.

The Bank also holds, from time-to-time, foreign currency assets and liabilities that arise from international market operations.

7.2 Local Currency Activities

Local currency activities arise as follows: (i) Liquidity management operations: Liquidity management largely involves the CBSL offsetting the daily net flows to or from government or market by advancing funds to or withdrawing funds from the banking system. Most of this business is undertaken through daily open market operations.

(ii) Holding an investment portfolio comprising of Sri Lanka government securities to support the liability for currency in circulation. The Bank’s policy is to hold these investments for monetary operations and not for trading.

7.3 Trust and Custodial Activities

Amounts administered by the CBSL under custodial and administration arrangements are not included in these financial statements, as they do not form part of elements of financial statements of the Bank.

10. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

10.1 The table below shows the fair values of derivative financial instruments, recorded as assets or liabilities, together with their notional amounts. The notional amount recorded gross, is the amount of derivative’s underlying asset, reference rate or index and is the basis upon which changes in the value of derivatives are measured. The notional amounts indicate the volume of transactions outstanding at period end and are indicative of neither the market risk nor the credit risk.

10.2 The above derivatives consisting of Currency Swaps and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts were used for the purpose of managing market and liquidity risks in international reserves held by the Bank in line with the statutory objectives of maintenance of international reserves. The Bank entered into Swap transactions and Forward contracts with Licensed Banks and Foreign Central Banks in order to maintain international stability of the Sri Lankan

Rupee, to strengthen the financial system of the Country and to encourage those Banks to bring foreign funds.

10.3 Derivatives are financial contracts that derive their value in response to changes in interest rates, financial instruments prices, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit risk and indices.

10.4 A significant part of derivatives portfolio of the Bank consists of currency swaps entered into as a strategy to manage exchange rate risk and the short term liquidity requirements. In a currency swap, the Bank pays/ receives a specified amount of a currency on an agreed date in exchange of another currency at agreed rates.

10.5 From Foreign Exchange Forward contracts, the Bank gets the obligation to buy or sell specific amount of foreign currency on an agreed future date at an agreed rate.

10.6 The Bank’s exposure to derivative contracts is closely monitored as part of the overall risk management of the Bank to ensure expected benefits from such derivatives are crystalized to the Bank.

11.1 IMF Quota

The IMF Quotas (capital subscriptions) are the primary source of IMF resources received from its member countries. Each country’s quota is determined broadly on the basis of the relative economic size of the country. Upon joining the IMF, a country must pay 25 per cent of its quota in widely accepted foreign currencies or SDRs, and the remaining 75 per cent in its own currency. The IMF quota represents an asset of the Bank as it transacts with the IMF on its own account on behalf of the Government as per Articles of the IMF.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020Part II - 26

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

The IMF, based on the General Quota Review Agreement, decided to increase the quotas of each of the IMF’s 189 members in January 2016. As a result, Sri Lanka’s IMF quota increased to SDR 578.80 Mn on 17 February 2016 from the previous quota amount of SDR 413.40 Mn.

The amounts payable in respect of the IMF Quota is shown under the heading Quota Liability in Note 24. A member’s quota determines that country’s financial and organizational relationship with IMF, including:

(i) Subscriptions: A member’s subscription to IMF resources is equal to its quota and determines the maximum amount of financial resources the member is obliged to provide to the IMF. A member must pay its subscription in full; up to 25 per cent must be paid in reserve assets specified by the IMF (SDRs or usable currencies), and the rest in the member’s own currency.

(ii) Voting power: The quota defines a member’s voting power in IMF decisions. IMF member’s votes comprise basic votes plus one additional vote for each SDR 100,000 of quota. The 2008 reform fixed the number of basic vote at 5.50 per cent of total votes.

(iii) Access to financing: The amount of financing a member can obtain from the IMF (access limits) is based on its quota. Under Stand-By and Extended Arrangements, for instance, a member can currently borrow up to 145 per cent of its quota annually and 435 per cent cumulatively. Access to finance may be higher in exceptional circumstances.

(iv) SDR allocations: Members’ shares of SDR allocations are established in proportion to their quotas.

11.2 Holding of Special Drawing Rights

Holding of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) is potentially a claim on the freely usable currencies of IMF members in which holders of SDRs can exchange their SDRs for these currencies. The SDRs value as a reserve asset derives from the commitments of members to hold and accept SDRs, and to honor various obligations connected with the operation of the SDR system. The IMF ensures that the SDRs claim on freely usable currencies is being honored in two ways: by designating IMF members with a strong external position to purchase SDRs from members with weak external positions, and through the arrangement of voluntary exchanges between participating members in a managed market. The amount shown above represents the total holding of the Bank as at the respective reporting dates.

11.3 Deposits with IMF – PRGF – HIPC Trust Deposit

The PRGF – HIPC (Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries) Trust

Deposit was made under the agreement between the GOSL and the IMF on 21 April 2000 by transferring SDR 788,783 from Sri Lanka’s deposit in the post SCA-2 (Special Contingent Account) administered account with the IMF. This account was created under the guidance of the IMF by transferring the balance held in SCA-2 against Sri Lanka when it was decided to wind up SCA-2 by the IMF. The IMF requested the countries that had balances in the Post SCA-2 account to consider providing the balances in that account to the PRGF/HIPC Trust either as outright grant or as a means of providing a subsidy for PRGF/HIPC Loan. Accordingly GOSL agreed to transfer the funds from Post SCA–2 accounts to PRGF/HIPC Trust account, not as an outright grant, but as an interest free deposit until 2018. This was later extended until 2024.

The Articles of Agreement also allow for cancellations of SDRs, but to date, this provision has not been used. Increases in Allocation of SDR represents increases in holding of SDR as described in Note 11. Members of IMF are obligated to pay to the IMF an amount equal to its net cumulative allocation and any other amounts that may be due and payable because of its participation in the Special Drawing Rights Department at the point of termination or liquidation of IMF’s SDR Department.

This also include a research grant received from the Knowledge Partnership Program of the Bank of Korea amounting to Rs. 0.78 Mn which will be utilised to cover the cost of future local training programs of CBSL staff.

32. PENSION AND OTHER POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS

The Bank operates seven defined benefit plans which cover all eligible employees. Under the Employees’ Retirement Pension Scheme (old), employees who joined the Bank prior to 1 January 1998 and complete 10 years of service become eligible to the scheme. The employees who have joined the Bank after 1 January 1998 and complete 10 years of service become eligible for the new pension scheme. These Pension Schemes are non-contributory pension schemes where the cost of benefits is wholly borne by the Bank. The Widows’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme for male employees and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme for female employees are open to employees of the Bank who had joined prior to 1 January 1998 whereas the new Widows’ and Orphans and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme is open for employees of the Bank who joined after 1 January 1998. Eligible Employees under the Widows’ and Orphans Pension Scheme (old) and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme (old) plans who were recruited before 1 August 1994 contribute 5% of the monthly basic salary & employees who were recruited on or after 01 August 1994 contribute 10% of the monthly basic salary whereas the eligible employees under the new Widows’ and Orphans and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme contribute 5.5% of the monthly basic salary.

The Bank also provides gratuity benefits to employees who have completed five years of service in the Bank and

who are not eligible for a monthly pension payment under the Employees’ Retirement Pension Schemes. In order to meet this liability, a provision is carried forward in the Statement of Financial Position, equivalent to the liability calculated using the actuarial valuation.

The Bank has a Post-Employment Medical Benefit Scheme which provides reimbursement of certain medical expenses incurred by retired employees on account of themselves, their spouses, their parents and by widows/widowers.

The Bank employed an Independent Actuary M/s K. A. Pandit, Consultant & Actuary (Mumbai) to re-assess the defined benefit obligations and the current service costs attributable to the Employees’ Retirement Pension Schemes, Widows’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme, Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme, new Widows’ and Orphans’ and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension scheme, Gratuity Scheme and Medical Benefit Scheme during the year.

Funds of the Employee Retirement Pension Schemes, Widows’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme, Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme are managed separately and separate books are maintained. However, Gratuity Scheme and Medical Benefit Scheme are not separated from the books of accounts of the Bank. Further, investments and investment income are recorded separately for these funds in the Bank books and the income earned from the investments are transferred back to these funds and reinvested without being distributed.

The total present value of all benefit obligations of Rs. 70,241.23 Mn (2019 – Rs. 52,461.11 Mn) exceeds the total fair value of plan assets of Rs. 48,961.82 Mn (2019 – Rs. 43,931.50 Mn) at the end of the reporting period resulting in a deficit of Rs. 21,279.42 Mn (2019 Rs. 8,529.61 Mn).

The balance shown under Pension and Other Post Employment Benefit Plans in Statement of Financial Position differs from the net liability as per the actuary due to the following reasons:

a) The net asset position of the Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme is not reflected in the financial statements due to remote possibility of distributing any residual balance of the fund to the Bank.

b) For both gratuity and medical benefit schemes, the financial statements represent the gross liability position and not the net liability as per actuary, since the Bank does not keep relevant assets in a separate fund (internally maintained).

48. RISK MANAGEMENT

In pursuing its policy objectives, CBSL can face various risks, both financial and non-financial in nature. Since the materialization of any of such risks could have an adverse impact on the financial position and the reputation of CBSL, having a properly designed risk management framework in place is vital. The recognition of the strategic importance of an integrated approach to risk management, led to the creation of a separate Risk Management Department (RMD) at CBSL in 2015 to overcome the conventional management of viewing risk in silos. Accordingly, risk management was recognized as a key strategic priority of the CBSL and the Bank is in the process of implementing an Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) Framework for CBSL.

The Risk Governance Framework which was approved by the Monetary Board comprises both a Risk Governance Structure and a Risk Management Structure covering financial and non-financial risks confronted by the Bank. The Risk Governance Structure consists of the Monetary Board (MB), and two Board sub-committees, the Board Risk Oversight Committee (BROC) and the Monetary Board Advisory Audit Committee (MBAAC). The MB holds the ultimate responsibility for the overall risk management function of the Bank and sets the “Tone at the Top”.

The BROC was set up in August 2018 and is chaired by Mr. Sanjeeva Jayawardena, independent member of the Monetary Board and comprises two independent external experts (Mr. Naomal Goonewardena, Partner, Nithya Partners was appointed from 01 March 2019 onwards and Mr. Susantha Ratnayake, Chairman, Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (resigned from this position w.e.f. 30 November 2020) was appointed from 06 October 2020 onwards). The BROC oversees CBSL’s overall Risk Management and Compliance Functions via a formal delegation from the MB, and is responsible for laying the broad strategy and policies for the Bank’s risk management and compliance functions. The BROC also assists the MB to ensure a dedicated focus on risk management and compliance at the Bank.

The Risk Management Structure that has been put in place follows the Three Lines of Defence model. In the first line of defence, operational departments are responsible for identifying, analysing, evaluating, treating, monitoring, reviewing and reporting financial and/or operational risks related to their functions, through their respective reporting channels, in line with the risk management structure of the CBSL. The Risk Management Department, as a part of the second line of defence, is responsible for facilitating the risk management process related to financial and operational risks, by coordinating activities to direct and guide CBSL in this regard. The third line of defence, Internal Audit, is responsible for providing independent objective assurance and recommendations to add value and improving the control environment relating to operations of the CBSL through audits. Each of these three ‘lines’ plays a distinct role within the Bank’s risk governance framework.

In addition to facilitating operational risk management of all the departments under the three lines of defence

model, RMD is also responsible for the financial risk management of the fund management activities of the International Reserves (IR), and the Internal Investment Funds (IIF) of CBSL, as well as the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) which is carried out as an agency function for the Government. RMD formulated Investment Policy Statements (IPS), Strategic Asset Allocations (SAA) and Investment Guidelines (IG) for all three funds. RMD also independently monitored market and credit risks pertaining to these fund management activities and reported risks emanating from these to the respective Investment Oversight Committees (IOCs), the BROC and the MB on a periodic basis.

In line with the new framework, RMD developed a Risk Management Policy Statement (RMPS) for the CBSL, setting out the policies for the implementation of risk management across CBSL. In this process, CBSL follows accepted standards and guidelines for managing risks, while assigning risk ownership and management among different stakeholders with clear accountability.

RMD reviews the Operational Risk Taxonomy of the CBSL annually, updating it including/excluding risk categories and incorporating any other changes required to suit the prevailing risk environment. In addition, a biennial perception survey is conducted among the management of CBSL to determine their perception on the top bank-wide operational risks impacting the CBSL. The survey results are also considered when revising the Operational Risk Taxonomy of the CBSL, which helps prioritize key operational risk categories that could impact the CBSL requiring the attention of the Management.

To promote a risk culture within the bank, RMD conducted numerous risk awareness sessions for CBSL staff throughout the year at various fora.

In order to strengthen the operational risk management function, RMD collaborated with the World Bank Technical Assistance Mission (WBTAM). However, the expected extension to WBTAM was not possible during 2020 due to the pandemic.

RMD worked with departments to facilitate the development of Risk Registers and to refine these Risk Registers in a phased-out manner using a spreadsheet based risk register format. The risk profile of CBSL is developed using these Departmental Risk Registers, enhancing the operational risk management process.

RMD continued to administer incidents reported through the Incident Reporting System, enabling the development of a central repository of incidents and tracking progress on the implementation of corrective measures. The information gathered through this system will help in identifying possible risk trends, areas of vulnerabilities and improving related risk treatment measures.

With respect to financial risk management, RMD will further strengthen the risk management framework through the annual process of reviewing the investment policies and guidelines for each of the funds managed by CBSL. RMD is in the process of improving the credit risk management framework of the fund management activities of CBSL,

covering CBSL’s counterparties, issuers and custodians. In the meantime, RMD would continue to monitor credit and market risks pertaining to investments on an ongoing basis to ensure these investments are within the stipulated limits specified by the Monetary Board approved Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA), IPS and IG and highlight risks to the management at all times.

(c) Credit Exposure by Credit Rating

The following table represents the credit ratings of respective financial assets or issuers, based on the ratings of Standard and Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. Under Standard & Poor’s ratings and Fitch Ratings, AAA is the highest quality rating possible and indicates the lowest expectations of credit risk. It is assigned only in the case of exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitment. AA is very high quality grade, indicating very low expectation of credit risk, and A is an upper medium grade, indicating a low expectation of credit risk; BBB is the lowest investment grade rating, indicating that there is currently a low expectation of credit risk and exhibits adequate protection parameters. Ratings lower than AAA can be modified by + or – signs to indicate relative standing within the major categories. NR indicates that Standard and Poor’s or Fitch Rating have not rated the entity.

48.2 Interest Rate Risk

(a) Foreign Currency Interest Rate Sensitivity

Interest rate risk is the risk of loss arising from the changes in interest rates.

The interest rate sensitivity of the Fixed Income Securities portfolio, except the investment in Reserve Advisory Management Program (RAMP), is measured by the potential gain or loss that could incur due to a change in interest rate by 10 basis points. The interest rate sensitivity of the Fixed Income Securities portfolio held under RAMP is measured by the potential gain or loss that could incur due to a change in interest rate by 1 basis point. Sensitivity of the risk exposure of the segmented Fixed Income Securities Portfolio is given below:

Portfolio SegmentPotential Loss (USD Mn)20202019Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income7.948.14RAMP0.030.03

RMD manages the interest rate risk of the foreign assets portfolio by employing the following strategies:i) While the interest rate sensitivity measures the effect of a change in interest rates on the foreign assets portfolio, the Bank uses Modified Duration (MD) as a measurement of interest rate risk which considers interest rates as well as the duration of an investment. The MD measures the change in price of a security for a 1% change in the interest rates (yield). A higher MD indicates a higher risk. Hence, the Bank sets an appropriate MD from time to time considering the developments in the financial markets, portfolio characteristics and the risk appetite of the bond portfolio. The MDs of the foreign assets portfolio are tabulated below:

Investment SegmentModified Duration20202019Capital Market (Fixed Income Securities)2.112.03RAMP1.461.38

ii) Since the MD does not account for large changes in prices, another measure used for management of interest rate risk of the foreign reserves portfolio is convexity. Convexity measures the extent of deviation in bond price-yield curve from a straight line representing duration. It allows improving the duration approximation for bond price changes. Convexity is a change in Duration for

a change in yield. It measures the predictive error of Modified Duration. In other words, it is the second derivative of a security’s price with respect to its yield.

RAMP0.040.04

iii) Value at Risk (VaR)

VaR summarizes in a single number the downside risk of the portfolio, under normal market conditions, from financial market movements. Therefore, VaR is the maximum loss over a target horizon such that there is a low, pre-specified probability that the actual loss will be larger. VaR gives a number, in terms of money, which can be aggregated across risks and positions. The Bank uses Monte Carlo method to calculate VaR number for 10 days period at 99% confidence interval for its fixed income securities portfolio except for the investment in RAMP. The VaR of the fixed income securities portfolio held under RAMP is measured using the Monte Carlo method for one month period at 99 % confidence interval.

iv) Trading & Open Position Limits

Bank assigns specific dealer limits on intra-day and overnight position limits for individual dealers by way of “Dealing Authority “.

Interest rate risk measures related to the investments in the Reserve Advisory Management Program (RAMP) is reported to the International Reserves Investment and Oversight Committee on a regular basis.

an investment portfolio, as the Bank does not purchase Government Securities with the intention of earning an interest income. The Bank purchases or sells Government Securities to inject rupee liquidity into the domestic market or to absorb liquidity from the market in the course of carrying out its monetary policy operations in relation to one of its core objectives, maintaining economic and price stability. Hence, the volume of Government Securities in the Bank’s portfolio is determined by its monetary policy operations. In addition, the basic interest rates in the rupee market, the Repo rate and the Reverse Repo rate are policy rates determined by the Bank in

the course of implementing its monetary policy. Moreover, the Bank’s actions in injecting rupee liquidity or absorbing liquidity from the market have a significant impact on general rupee market interest rates. Thus, changes in the interest income earned from the Government Securities portfolio, which arise from changes in the volume of the Bank’s Government Securities portfolio, as well as changes in interest rates, are primarily a consequence of the Bank’s monetary policy actions, rather than due to investment decisions. Therefore, the Bank does not consider interest rate sensitivities arising from local currency assets.

48.3 Foreign Currency Risk

Foreign currency activities result mainly from the Bank’s holding of foreign currency assets under its foreign reserve management function. Volatility of the foreign exchange markets may expose the Bank to exchange risk. The Monetary Board and International Reserves Investment and Oversight Committee (IRIOC) have set percentage holdings of different currencies in its International

Reserves. In deciding on the currency allocation, public debt repayment requirements are given due consideration. Accordingly, the Bank holds most major currencies such as US Dollars, Sterling Pounds, Japanese Yen, Euro, Australian Dollars and New Zealand Dollars. Compliance with limits established for foreign currency positions are monitored.

48.5 Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the difficulty that an entity will encounter in raising funds at short notice to meet commitments associated with financial instruments. Liquidity risk is also the risk that an entity will have to sell a financial asset quickly at much less than its fair value.

a) Liquidity is a key consideration in determining the composition of the Bank’s foreign currency assets. This reflects the potential requirement to liquidate foreign reserves for intervention purposes and to settle other commitments such as public debt and IMF Loan repayments when the need arises. The Bank has adopted the following measures aimed at ensuring quick access to funds:

• Liquid asset ratios based on the liquidity characteristics of securities held

• Limits on maximum proportion of reserves that may be held in one currency and with one counterparty

b) In order to reduce the level of liquidity risk arising out of the local currency activities, particularly open market operations, the Bank uses highly liquid marketable instruments such as Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds as collateral. It manages the daily liquidity position of the banking system by way of infusing into or withdrawal from the system, using instruments such as repo / reverse repo, CBSL securities and USD /LKR Swaps.

50. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES

50.1 Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities

‘Fair Value’ is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Bank has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.

The determination of fair value for financial assets and liabilities for which there is no observable market price requires the use of valuation techniques as described in accounting policy Note 5.2. For financial instruments that trade infrequently and have little price transparency, fair value is less objective, and requires varying degrees

of judgement depending on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty of market factors, pricing assumptions and other risks affecting the specific instrument. The fair value hierarchy of financial instruments is given below:

Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

Level 3: Fair value measurements using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

Land & Buildings

Valuation MethodLand is valued using market approach with direct comparison method, whereby assets are compared to recent sales with no added or nominal added improvement value, making adjustments for points of difference to derive the fair value.

Depreciated Current Replacement Cost (DRC) method is used in valuing all the buildings except Central Point, White Aways and Lloyds Building, considering that the assets controlled by the public sector entities that provide service to the community are not traded on an open liquid market.

Income approach is used to value the other buildings which values the property based on estimated future income, profits or cash flow that are converted (discounted) to a single current amount.

Under the Market Approach, estimated fair value would get increased/(decreased) if;

Price per perch would get higher/(lower)Price per square foot would get higher/(lower)Depreciation rate for building would get lower/(higher)

Under Income Approach, estimated fair value would get increased/(decreased) if;

Gross annual rentals would get higher/(lower)Years purchase would get higher/(lower)

Derivatives

Derivative valuation models use forward prices (calculated by extrapolating the forward points available in the market) and discount rates calculated based on zero coupon yield curves of the respective currencies as of the valuation date. If the instrument that is valued contains a margin, adjustments are made to the forward prices and/or the interest rates to represent the impact of the margin rate. Embedded Derivatives - Currency Options

Fair Value of the Embedded Derivative Products was calculated using Black- Scholes model of which the movement is as follows;

50.2 Repurchase and Resale Agreements

The reported value of repurchase and resale agreements is considered to approximate their fair value due to short term nature of the agreements. The carrying value of the provided Standing Deposit Facility as at 31 December 2020 was Rs. 209,507.90 Mn (2019 - Rs. 43,298.32 Mn) and the carrying value of Sri Lanka Government Securities purchased under resale agreements as at 31 December 2020 was Rs.2,728.41 Mn (2019 – Rs. 50,354.88 Mn). There was no outstanding balance of Sri Lanka Government Securities sold under repurchase agreements as at 31 December 2020 (2019 – Nil).

50.3 Currency in Circulation

The fair value of Currency in Circulation is considered to be its face value as reported in the Financial Statements.

50.4 Deposits

The carrying value of deposits are considered to approximate their fair value as they are payable on demand.

- Securites Sold under Agreements to Repurchase- Securities Lending- Securities Pledged

54.1 Transferred Financial Assets that are not Derecognized in their Entirety

a. Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase transactions are performed as part of the Monetary Policy operations of the bank and continues to be recognised in their entirety under “Sri Lanka Government Securities” in the statement of financial position because it retains substantially all of the risks

and rewards of ownership. The cash consideration to be paid and the interest accured there on are recognized under Securities sold under repurchase agreements in the local financial liabilities of the Statement of Financial Position.

b. Securities Lending

Securities lending describes the established market practice by which, for a fee, securities are transferred temporarily from one party (the lender, i.e. CBSL), to another (the borrower); the borrower is obliged to return them either on demand or at the end of any agreed term. Currently a selected Clearing House (CH) functions as the custodian for the supranational bonds and bonds issued by different issuers. CBSL has signed an agreement which enable CH to lend at their wish depending on the demand for those bonds. Since the lending does not involve CBSL and CH lends them directly to the borrowers, the process is called auto bond lending. At the end of each month, custodian will send fee income for auto bond lending, if any for the bonds which they lent under auto bond lending programme. The Bank continues to recognize the securities in their entirety in the statement of financial position because it retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. These securities are presented in the statement of financial position as “Securities at Fair value through other Comprehensive Income”.

c. Securities Pledged

In order to facilitate the securities settlement process, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) pledged securities amounting to AUD 35.00 Mn and obtained a credit facility of USD 30.00 Mn from Euroclear Bank. The pledged securities are held in a separate account at Euroclear Bank.

With reference to the General Conditions Governing Extensions of Credit Facilities to participants in the Euroclear System, CBSL’s credit facility was reduced to USD 20.00 Mn with effect from 31 January 2017, following a review of the transaction related activity in respect of CBSL’s accounts with Euroclear Bank.

Required actions have already been taken to re-establish the suspended credit facility and informed to Euroclear Bank on 12 August 2020.

2. BANK SUPERVISION

As per the provisions of the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949 and the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988, the Bank Supervision Department (BSD) has been conferred with powers and duties to conduct continuous supervision and examination of licensed commercial banks (LCBs) and licensed specialised banks (LSBs) in Sri Lanka (hereinafter referred to as licensed banks) and to issue regulations to licensed banks with the aim of ensuring the safety and soundness of the banking sector while safeguarding the interests of depositors and other stakeholders of licensed banks in Sri Lanka.

Accordingly, BSD carries out functions pertaining to the regulation and supervision of licensed banks and they include issuing licences to carry out banking business, formulating and issuing prudential regulations, conducting continuous supervision and periodic statutory examinations of licensed banks, assessing and approving the fitness and propriety of Directors, Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and Key Management Personnel (KMPs) of licensed banks, granting regulatory approvals, initiating regulatory actions as prescribed by the Monetary Board, and engaging in awareness and capacity building of the banking sector.

As at end 2020, the banking sector in Sri Lanka comprised 24 LCBs and 6 LSBs. In addition, 3 Representative Offices (ROs) of foreign banks were in operation in Sri Lanka. During 2020, two foreign banks, namely Axis Bank Ltd and ICICI Bank Ltd, wound up their operations in Sri Lanka, in accordance with the business decisions of their respective Head Offices in line with policy decisions taken on their global operations. The list of licensed banks and ROs is provided in Annex II-I.

A summary of the main functions and activities performed by BSD during the year 2020 is given below:

2.1 Issuance of Prudential Regulations

(a) Special credit support scheme to accelerate economic growth

(b) Recovery of accommodation to exporters

(c) Measures to curtail imports and foreign currency investments

(d) Relief measures to assist COVID-19 affected businesses and individuals

(e) Extraordinary regulatory measures to provide flexibility to licensed banks to support businesses and individuals affected by the outbreak of COVID-19

(f) Maximum interest rates on pawning advances by licensed banks

2.2 Drafting the New Banking Act

BSD is in the process of drafting a new Banking Act with a view to further strengthen the legal and regulatory framework of licensed banks. The key areas to be considered for the proposed new Banking Act include an overall mandate for supervision and regulation, a differentiated regulatory framework considering systemic importance of banks, strengthening corporate governance, consolidated supervision, resolution, imposing monetary penalties/fines, ring-fencing of banks to mitigate contagion risk, strengthening provisions for mergers, acquisitions and consolidation. The Central Bank expects to enact the new Act in mid-2022.

2.3 Formulation of Concept for an Asset Management Company

During 2020, BSD formulated the concept to establish a dedicated Asset Management Company (AMC) to purchase and manage non-performing assets of both banks and non-banking financial institutions (NBFIs) under resolution and are viable. Establishment of AMC will be beneficial in reinforcing the financial system stability by increasing the performance of banks and NBFIs through reduction of NPLs and allowing them to direct credit to productive economic sectors.

2.4 Approvals granted by the Monetary Board and the Director of Bank Supervision

(a) Mergers, Acquisitions and Closures of Licensed Banks

The merger process between the Housing Development Finance Corporation Bank of Sri Lanka (HDFC Bank) and State Mortgage and Investment Bank (SMIB), which commenced in 2018 continued during 2020. In addition, facilitation for the merger of Sri Lanka Savings Bank Limited

(d) Regulatory Actions

During 2020, licensed banks were required to initiate corrective measures with regard to non-compliance with the Banking Act and Directions issued thereunder on 25 instances. Further, the Monetary Board was apprised of the banking sector performance on a quarterly basis.

2.5 Conduct of Continuous Supervision

(a) Continuous supervision is an on-going monitoring mechanism on the affairs of individual banks which serves as an early warning system to ascertain the operational efficiency and long-term sustainability of licensed banks, and enables the implementation of corrective measures where necessary to ensure the safety of depositors’ funds.

(b) Continuous supervision is conducted based on periodic financial and prudential information submitted weekly/monthly/quarterly/annually by each bank largely through the web-based FinNet system. The initiative to revamp the database maintained in BSD in consultation with the Information Technology Department (ITD), continued in 2020 in order to facilitate better report generation. Further, 8 new FinNet returns were developed while 2 existing returns were amended.

(c) In light of the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, special reports were submitted with regard to foreign borrowings, foreign exchange inflows, outflows position, etc. In addition, banking industry aggregate data were shared with other departments of the Central Bank and external government institutions to facilitate policy decisions and preparation of reports. Further, 15 presentations on the performance of the banking industry were also prepared for various forums.

(d) With the establishment of the Financial Consumer Relations Department (FCRD), the majority of the customer complaints were directed to FCRD, while BSD attended to complaints made by customers/general public regarding fraud by bank staff/external parties, misconduct by bank staff, etc. Further, during 2020, approximately 12 requests made under the Right to Information Act No. 12 of 2016 were handled by BSD.

(e) BSD facilitated the collection and submission of information on reimbursement of interest relating to the Special Interest Scheme for Senior Citizens to the Ministry of Finance on a quarterly basis and a special examination was conducted on a remote basis to reconcile the accuracy of information provided by licensed banks.

(f) BSD continued to monitor the progress on addressing supervisory concerns identified during statutory examinations of banks within specified time targets on a quarterly basis.

2.6 Conduct of Periodic Examinations

(a) During 2020, BSD conducted 19 Statutory Examinations, including examinations on full scope basis and follow-

Part II

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 77

up examinations. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak in the country since March 2020, physical visits for on-site examination of banks were limited and alternatively, Statutory Examinations were conducted on a remote basis during this period.

(b) In addition to the above, Spot Examinations were conducted on several licensed banks on 8 instances to verify matters relating to operational risk, market risk, corporate governance, interest computation methodology adopted by banks with respect to moratorium loans granted under the COVID-19 Relief Scheme and on USD/LKR movement in the domestic foreign exchange market, etc. Reports on Statutory Examinations of 14 banks conducted during 2019 were submitted to the Monetary Board. In addition, reports of Statutory Examinations of 15 banks conducted in 2020, including 6 Statutory Examinations conducted on a remote basis, were submitted to the Monetary Board. 4 reports of Statutory Examinations conducted in 2020 are in the process of completion.

(c) Further, several limited scope examinations were conducted on areas, such as customer complaints, credit/debit card transactions, security of customer information, etc. Accordingly, banks were recommended to take appropriate measures to avoid recurrence of such events.

(d) Major concerns raised at certain examinations included deteriorating asset quality in terms of increased impaired loans, lapses identified in the computation of impairment charges resulting in inaccurate computation of impaired loans, low capitalisation and efficiency, lapses in corporate governance and management, deficiencies in technology risk and liquidity risk management, and concerns over treasury operations in certain banks.

(e) Conducting Statutory Examinations of banks on a consolidated basis was initiated during 2020 and several meetings were held with other financial sector regulators of the group entities of the selected banks. Accordingly, 2 Statutory Examinations extending the scope to consolidated supervision were completed during 2020 and the reports including findings of the consolidated supervision were submitted to the Monetary Board.

(f) The Bank Sustainability Rating Indicator (BSRI), a comprehensive supervisory guidance framework on assigning scores/ratings to licensed banks was further developed in 2020 in order to adopt a more robust risk-based examination mechanism. During this process, 3 banks were assigned with supervisory ratings based on the BSRI Model considering a combination of quantitative and qualitative indicators attributable to the banks’ efficiency and sustainability. The progress on implementing the model was submitted to the Monetary Board and full implementation of the model will commence from 01 October 2021 onwards in line with the revised BSRI framework as approved by the Monetary Board.

2.7 Awareness and Capacity Building of the Banking Sector

(a) Capacity Building

During 2020, BSD provided resource persons for capacity building programmes of the banking sector, covering subject areas of regulatory compliance, banking, risk management and laws and regulatory developments pertaining to banking and finance. Considering the COVID-19 outbreak, such programmes were conducted virtually.

BSD continued its commitment to build capacity of its staff in 2020, and officers participated in both local and foreign online training programmes conducted in the areas of risk-based supervision, banking sector regulatory and supervisory responses to deal with the impact of COVID-19, Basel III standards, cybersecurity, financial innovation, financial reporting standards and sustainable finance.

Officers of BSD also continued to serve as committee members in various committees including the Working Committee on Prudential Directions and Regulations of the Government Securities Market and Operations of Primary Dealers, Steering Committee of the Financial Sector Computer Security Incident Response Team (FINCSIRT), Taskforce to Study Virtual Currency Schemes in Sri Lanka, Working Group of Proposed Measures to Enhance the Marketability of Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs), Co-operative Bank Supervision National Committee, Technical Evaluation Committee of Consultant to Amend the Payment and Settlement Act, Domestic Financial Market Infrastructure Development Project, etc.

(b) Meetings with Banks and other Stakeholders

BSD continued to function as the secretariat for the monthly meetings of bank CEOs chaired by the Governor which are aimed at maintaining a continuous dialogue between the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and the banking sector on matters relating to the developments in the Sri Lankan economy, the banking sector, and the regulatory and supervisory framework. Due to the situation that prevailed amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, most of these meetings were conducted virtually. Additionally, a meeting of bank chairpersons was held to apprise them of the banking sector performance, developments in the economy and local and global regulatory frameworks, and the expectations of the regulator during these extraordinary times.

Regular meetings were conducted with the senior management and Board-appointed committees of concerned licensed banks to discuss bank-specific matters, to ensure proper oversight and timely implementation of corrective actions, and to ensure the sustainability of

the banking sector. Further, BSD conducted a series of meetings with external auditors of licensed banks and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka to discuss matters pertaining to specific areas to focus on bank audits and consistent application of accounting standards by licensed banks amidst the COVID-19 outbreak.

BSD organised two meetings of the Financial Sector Oversight Council (FSOC), which comprises heads of core financial sector regulators to facilitate cooperation among member institutions to ensure the efficiency, soundness and safety of the financial system.

3. CENTRE FOR BANKING STUDIES

Centre for Banking Studies (CBS), as the training arm of the Central Bank, plays a key and strategic role in human capital development of the financial services industry in support of the key objectives of the Central Bank. Accordingly, giving due prominence to developing necessary competencies and

enhancing knowledge on monetary policy operations and financial sector regulations, CBS offered a number of relevant and timely programmes during 2020. Even though the operations of CBS were affected by the COVID–19 pandemic due to restrictions on conducting in-person programmes, CBS continued to offer various training programmes, seminars and workshops through online platforms and webinars in the areas of banking and finance, treasury operations, economics, rural sector development, risk management and compliance, accounting and financial management, laws and regulations, research and data analysis, information technology, human resources and general management to the whole financial services sector in 2020.

CBS, successfully implementing its blended training strategy in 2020 through physical and virtual methods, conducted 52 programmes during the year which consisted of 22 calendar programmes, 13 special programmes, 06 educational programmes and 10 public lectures. Throughout the year 3,468 participants attended CBS programmes in person and via online platforms.

Several programmes were conducted in collaboration with international organisations with the view of sharing international perspectives and latest developments. Capacity building programmes were conducted in collaboration with the SEACEN Research and Training Centre and the Reserve Bank Staff College of Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In addition, CBS conducted special programmes on the request of the local commercial banks, specialised banks, other financial institutions and government institutions to meet their new and emerging needs.

Appreciating the importance of social responsibility of promoting public awareness and improving economic and financial literacy, CBS also hosted public lectures on contemporary issues related to the economy and the financial sector. Further, CBS assisted its regional offices to conduct series of webinars covering diverse areas with a wider viewership. CBS continued to co-ordinate the educational television series, “Thakshilawa” and “Ariwootroo”, which was telecasted in Sinhala and Tamil medium respectively, mainly targeting the GCE Advanced Level students who follow Economics as a subject. Further, CBS conducted the 70th Anniversary Oration programme of the Central Bank in collaboration with the Secretariat Department.

4. COMMUNICATIONS

During 2020, Communications Department (CMD) continued to support the accomplishment of the Central Bank’s core objectives of maintaining economic and price stability and financial system stability, as well as its ancillary objectives carried out by its agency functions and corporate services, through the timely dissemination of information. CMD started the year by web-uploading the “Road Map 2021: Monetary and Financial Sector Policies for 2021 and Beyond” in January 2020, to communicate the way forward for monetary and financial sector policies. However, the situation changed

Part II

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 79

drastically with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although direct communications, such as press conferences, speeches, lectures, seminars, etc. were limited to an extent due to the restrictions on travel and gatherings brought about by the pandemic situation, CMD overcame this challenge by enhancing communications through digital media. Its official website, www.cbsl.gov.lk, was developed further to host a “COVID-19 Webpage” as a single location with access to all information on policies and measures implemented by the Central Bank to counter the economic impact of COVID-19. While the Sinhala translations were done by the officers in the respective departments, the Tamil Translation Unit of CMD ensured all Tamil translations for the Bank in 2020 were completed in a timely manner, thereby contributing towards achieving Central Bank’s mission of providing information in all three official languages, in compliance with the National Language Policy.

4.1 Core Functions

Overall, CMD issued over a thousand press releases, including ‘Monetary Policy Reviews’ and the decisions of the Monetary Board in relation to financial institutions and financial markets, in all three official languages. Although eight monetary policy press conferences were scheduled for 2020 as per the Advance Release Calendar, the curfew and lockdown situation that prevailed in the country enabled the Central Bank to host only a limited number of press conferences pertaining to monetary policy in-person, during the first and third quarters of the year, and a virtual press conference during the fourth quarter via Zoom. CMD also supported the monetary policy endeavors of the Central Bank through its analyses of monetary policy expectations prior to the Monetary Board meetings and monetary policy reach subsequent to the monetary policy announcements. The former summarises policy rate predictions and forecasts by local research institutions as published in the local newspapers, and their rationales, to gauge public perceptions and expectations, while the latter strives to assess the reach of the core messages of the monetary policy review within a week after each press conference, to identify the reactions by the media to the monetary policy decisions of the Central Bank. Corrective actions were taken to rectify all inadvertent mis-reporting and deliberate inaccuracies by the media.

CMD facilitated the press conference on “2020-The Year of Digital Transactions” organised by the Payments and Settlements Department, as an effort to broaden CMD’s agenda to areas outside monetary policy.

As the general public was increasingly relying on unauthorised financial institutions and other illegal means of making money, such as pyramid and Ponzi schemes. CMD embarked on an awareness campaign on unauthorised financial businesses, to warn the general public about their dangers. As part of this campaign, CMD designed several advertisements in collaboration with key departments that are responsible for

maintaining financial system stability, comprising comic strips, audio and video clips in the official languages, that were published in newspapers, broadcasted on radio stations, and posted on social media. In addition, several posters were designed in the official languages in collaboration with these departments and the Regional Offices of the Central Bank. In 2020, CMD strengthened communication through the Central Bank Twitter account and disseminated information through easily comprehensible infographics on both Facebook and Twitter.

4.2 Other Communications

CMD also published a special newspaper supplement in the official languages to mark the 70th Anniversary of the Central Bank and contributed to the many other flagship events in the Bank, amongst which were the Bank’s 70th Anniversary Oration on “Central Banking in the Sri Lankan Developmental State” delivered by the Governor, Deshamanya Professor W. D. Lakshman. In addition, CMD issued press notices, including advertisements and allotted Gazette notifications as per the requirements of other departments, from time to time, during 2020. CMD also sent out SMS alerts pertaining to Telegraphic Transfer (exchange) rates, Sri Lanka Interbank Offered Rates (SLIBOR) rates and policy rates.

Public awareness programmes of the Central Bank were also affected by COVID-19. Nevertheless, several awareness programmes on a range of diverse topics such as ‘Objectives and Functions of the Central Bank’, ‘Sri Lanka’s Economy’, and ‘Prohibited Investment Schemes & Unauthorised Deposit Taking’ were coordinated by CMD despite the challenges faced during the pandemic situation. CMD, in collaboration with Centre for Banking Studies (CBS), also successfully conducted awareness programmes during 2020 for journalists to make them aware of Central Bank objectives and functions, and for Central Bank staff to help develop their journalistic writing skills.

Sales of Central Bank publications were made through its sales counters at the Economic History Museum, CBS in Rajagiriya, and the Regional Offices, as well as at the Colombo International Book Fair held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall, Colombo, from 18 - 27 September 2020. CMD also distributed copies of various publications free of charge among government schools offering the GCE Advanced Level Economics subject and public libraries throughout the country.

CMD’s Photography and Video Unit continued to cover the events of the Central Bank in 2020 and delivered all related services, including uploading recordings to the website of the Bank and YouTube in a timely manner. CMD operated the Printing Press of the Central Bank, which provided the services to meet the printing requirements of the Central Bank with high quality standards, including its magazines “Satahana”, “News Survey” and “Vaippaham”. and preparing the print-ready version of “Economic and Social Statistics of Sri Lanka

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 80

Part II

– 2020”. Further, printing of posters, handbills, leaflets, letterheads, certificates, visiting cards, various forms, etc. was undertaken by the Central Bank Printing Press. However, the Central Bank Printing Press was closed down in November 2020 and all printing and related functions of the Central Bank were outsourced thereafter.

4.3 Internal Communications

Internal communication was also strengthened to enable the senior management to be well informed of the current affairs in the economy, the financial sector and other matters relevant to the Central Bank in the international arena. Articles and public opinions extracted from fifteen national newspapers published in all three official languages were summarised for the senior management on a monthly basis. Similarly, summaries of online news relevant to the Central Bank were shared with the senior management via email daily. The official internal newsletter, “Kavuluwa” was published digitally and uploaded to the internal website of the Central Bank staff, “Mansala”.

Library and Information Centre (LIC) plays a central role in internal communications by helping officers of the Central Bank prepare for their professional roles through the acquisition of knowledge, and enabling them to be up-to-date with economic developments. LIC increased its collection of books, reports, CDs and journals for the staff to refer regarding various subjects. LIC has subscribed to online databases, such as ‘ScienceDirect’, ‘EconLit’ and ‘Wiley Online Journals’, which provide access to a vast collection of publications on topics relating to economics, management and finance. In addition, LIC has subscribed to several other online resources on subjects relevant to central banking, e.g., www.centralbanking.com, www.risk.net and www.ft.com, and continues to provide staff access to these resources on a daily basis. In 2020, LIC continued the subscription to OpenAthens, which provides the Central Bank’s officers remote access to journal articles. LIC subscribed to 84 Foreign Journals and 18 Local Journals in print form in 2020. LIC continued to compile electronic notifications such as “Recent Additions” (i.e. new books), “Current Contents”, “International News Alert”, “Local Press”, and notes and reports on economics, banking and finance were disseminated via the intranet.

5. CURRENCY

The Central Bank has the sole right and authority to issue currency in Sri Lanka under the powers vested by Section 49 of the Monetary Law Act (MLA) No. 58 of 1949. Accordingly, Currency Department (CRD) of the Central Bank handles functions related to the statutory responsibility of the Monetary Board on currency operations. During 2020, amidst the adverse effects of COVID-19, CRD was able to fulfill its statutory and all other obligations through effective planning and perseverance. A summary of the activities of CRD and currency operations during 2020 is given below.

5.1 Currency in Circulation

Demand for currency soared in 2020 as a direct impact of the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic situation in the country. Accordingly, the value of total currency in circulation (CIC) increased by 23.1 percent to Rs. 834.2 billion as at 31 December 2020, as shown in Table II-3 below.

5.2 Currency Management

Functions of Currency Management mainly comprise issuance of good quality currency notes and coins into circulation, acceptance of currency deposits from Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs), and withdrawal of unfit (unserviceable) currency notes and coins from circulation while facilitating payment mechanisms in the country. In order to ensure effective currency management, CRD continued the following activities during the year 2020:

(a) Currency Printing and Minting

CRD placed an order for 160 million pieces of new currency notes for the year 2020 to meet the demand and maintain sufficient stocks and placed orders for minting 7.5 million pieces of circulation coins.

(b) Issuance of Currency

Due to the unforeseen high demand for currency notes and operational limitations owing to strict adherence

to health guidelines and other related directives issued by the Government and health authorities, CRD had to adapt to the new normal. Accordingly, CRD focused on direct reissuance of fit (serviceable) currency notes deposited by LCBs back into circulation and to encourage direct exchange of serviceable currency notes among LCBs. In such context, during 2020, CRD issued currency for the value of Rs. 697.3 billion into circulation, which comprised Rs. 467.1 billion of serviceable currency notes and Rs. 229.5 billion of new currency notes and coins for the value of Rs. 0.7 billion. The decrease in currency note issues in 2020 in comparison with the previous year is mainly due to direct exchange of serviceable currency notes by LCBs among themselves.

(c) Acceptance of Currency Deposits

CRD accepts currency deposits from LCBs, primarily to maintain the statutory reserve requirement imposed by the Central Bank. CRD also accepts unserviceable currency notes including damaged currency notes from LCBs to remove those from circulation to maintain good quality notes in circulation. The number of serviceable currency notes deposited by LCBs during 2020 recorded lower compared with previous years, mainly due to the reduction of the Statutory Reserve Ratio and the facilitation of direct exchange of serviceable currency among LCBs. Further, deposits of unserviceable currency notes also decreased in 2020.

5.3 Other Activities

(a) Operating Currency Counters

During the year 2020, CRD catered to the public through the currency counters by exchanging damaged currency notes to the value of Rs. 79 million and exchanging coins to the value of Rs. 35 million. In addition, CRD continued facilitation of the special exchange counter for the public established at the Bank of Ceylon, Pettah Branch by issuing currency notes and coins to the values of Rs. 379 million and Rs. 34 million, respectively.

(b) Operating Economic History Museum

Due to health regulations imposed by the authorities, CRD was unable to render regular services to the public through the Economic History Museum (EHM) unlike in previous years. However, during the year 2020, EHM rendered services to 2,385 individuals by providing a wide knowledge on Sri Lankan currency notes and coins, sale of commemorative notes, coins and collector items, and by conducting presentations.

(c) Preserving Public Confidence in Currency

CRD continued to work in cooperation with the Counterfeit Currency Bureau of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to minimise the incidence of counterfeit notes and to preserve public confidence in currency. Accordingly, CRD facilitated the certification of 2,160 counterfeit notes, which were detected and referred to the Central Bank. The rate of counterfeit notes detected was around 2 notes per million notes in circulation, indicating a substantially low level of incidence of counterfeiting compared to many other countries. 130 certificates were issued as conclusive evidence of the imitation of currency notes to facilitate court proceedings in terms of Section 59 of the MLA, and CRD attended 5 court cases relating to counterfeiting during the year. From a stability point of view, appropriate policy initiatives would also help preserve the value of currency.

(d) Issuance of Commemorative Coin

In commemoration of the Central Bank’s unique and valued contribution to the prosperity of Sri Lanka for over 70 years since 1950, an uncirculated commemorative coin in the denomination of Rs. 20 was issued in 2020. Further, a circulation standard commemorative coin of the same was introduced into circulation at the beginning of the year 2021.

(e) Approvals for Reproduction of Currency Notes

In terms of the Monetary Board-approved policy on reproduction of currency notes, CRD granted approval for 5 requests during the year 2020.

5.4 Developments and New Projects

(a) Introduction of the Rs. 2000 Note to 11th Note Series

In 2020, an international market survey was conducted by CRD to study the latest security features and banknote substrate available. This survey was done in line with designing the proposed Rs. 2000 note to the 11th note series and improve security aspects of other high-denominated currency notes. The note is currently being designed and it is expected to be issued during the year 2021.

(b) Revamping Currency Operations

The first stage of the procurement for revamping of currency operations was concluded in 2020. Accordingly, interested parties were invited to submit their proposals. Through this project, CRD expects to address several operational issues, including increasing currency note processing capacity and operational efficiency.

6. DOMESTIC OPERATIONS

6.1 Functions of DOD

As per the enabling provisions of the Monetary Law Act (MLA) No. 58 of 1949, the Domestic Operations Department (DOD) is entrusted with performing several main functions in supporting the achievement of core objectives of the Central Bank. These include implementing monetary policy with active Open Market Operations (OMOs), regulating statutory reserves of licensed commercial banks (LCBs), acting as the banker to the commercial banks, acting as the banker and the official depository of the Government, Government agencies and other institutions, providing temporary advances to the Government, maintaining settlement accounts for participants of the Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS), updating the RTGS by accounting Multilateral Net Settlement Balances (MLNSB) of LCBs generated by the Lanka Clear (Pvt) Ltd., provision of intraday liquidity facility (ILF) to the RTGS participants and the regulating authorised money brokers (AMBs).

6.2 Implementation of Monetary Policy

With the objective of maintaining short-term interest rates at a level commensurate with the monetary policy stance of the Central Bank, while preventing undue pressure on short-term interest rates, DOD continued to implement monetary policy actions of the Central Bank. Monetary policy implementation in 2020, particularly with the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly revolved around the extra accommodative monetary policy with significant levels of excess liquidity to mitigate the adverse impacts of the pandemic on economic activity.

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 83

DOD relied mainly on OMOs to steer the Average Weighted Call Money Rate (AWCMR), towards the desired level with low volatility. Accordingly, to ensure certainty of liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic, while conducting its overnight and short-term liquidity operations, the Central Bank provided long-term liquidity assistance to LCBs through the long-term reverse repo auctions for an extended period of three months. In the meantime, long-term liquidity assistance was also extended for a period up to 15 days to Standalone Primary Dealers (SPDs) through the Liquidity Support Facility (LSF). In addition, while reducing the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) to infuse a substantial amount of permanent liquidity, with the view of providing more flexibility in liquidity management, the minimum daily reserve requirement to be held by a LCB with the Central Bank was reduced from 90 per cent to 20 per cent of the required reserves on any given day. Meanwhile, standing facilities were also provided continuously to market participants to address liquidity needs on an overnight basis.

With a view to ensuring adequate credit flows towards the sectors having special liquidity needs during the COVID-19 pandemic and to support the revival of economic activities through ensuring such credit flows, the Central Bank introduced two new credit schemes to provide funds to LCBs under the provisions of Section 83(1) of the MLA. Accordingly, the Liquidity Facility to the Contractors and Suppliers (LFCS) and the Saubagya COVID-19 Renaissance Facility (SCRF) were implemented by DOD in June 2020.

6.2.1 Open Market Operations

(a) Liquidity forecast

DOD undertakes estimation of domestic money market liquidity on a daily basis based on a number of factors with a view to address liquidity needs of the market participants through appropriate market operations in consistency with the monetary policy stance of the Central Bank. In this regard, the impact of monetary operations initiated by the Central Bank as well as the liquidity effects of autonomous factors such as currency in circulation, foreign exchange related transactions of the Central Bank, changes in the commercial bank reserve positions and transactions of the Government with the Central Bank are also taken into consideration.

(b) Market Operations Committee

The Market Operations Committee (MOC) is entrusted with the task of translating overall monetary policy considerations adopted by the Monetary Board into daily monetary operations. Accordingly, upon reviewing developments in the domestic money and foreign exchange markets on a daily basis, the MOC decides on the required actions in relation to liquidity management, taking into consideration the estimated liquidity conditions, desired level of the operating target, liquidity distribution among market participants, the need for devising appropriate market signals, etc.

(c) Auctions

DOD is engaged in liquidity management operations to steer the amount of bank reserves to maintain the operating target of the monetary policy at a desired level by conducting liquidity absorption and liquidity injecting auctions appropriately.

(i) Repurchase (Repo) Auctions

In early 2020, DOD conducted overnight, short-term and long-term repo auctions on a needs basis to absorbing excess liquidity from the domestic money market. Accordingly, overnight repo auctions were conducted to absorb liquidity on an overnight basis when the money market liquidity was in a surplus position. Short-term repo auctions were conducted as a strategy to absorb liquidity for a period of up to one week on the same day settlement basis. Long-term repo auctions were conducted with settlement on the next business day with the view to absorb excess market liquidity that appears to persist for a considerable period.

(d) Special Credit Schemes

As per the provisions of the MLA, the Central Bank implemented two special loan schemes during the year 2020 to provide funds to LCBs at a concessionary rate of 1.00 per cent per annum for a period of up to 180 days for the purpose of on-lending to the contractors and suppliers of the Government in the construction, pharmaceutical and such other identified sectors and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively, at a rate not exceeding 4.00 per cent. LCBs were required to provide credit facilities to contractors and suppliers of the Government upon the receipt of a letter of acceptance for payment of outstanding bills issued by the Government and the Central Bank disbursed funds under the LFCS to LCBs based on the promissory notes from such LCBs which have been backed by Treasury bills and Treasury bonds as eligible collaterals. Under the SCRF, Central Bank provided funds to LCBs at the concessionary rate of 1.00 per cent against the pledge of a broad spectrum of collaterals, with a view to reviving businesses adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

6.2.2. Standing Facility

Standing facilities were provided to PIs throughout the year at the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR). The Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) was used to accept excess liquidity of PIs, while the Standing Lending Facility (SLF) was available to provide liquidity to PIs, when they were unable to fulfil their overnight liquidity requirements completely through the inter-bank money market and OMO auctions. Prevalence of significant levels of excess liquidity in the banking system has led SDF to attract more and more funds on an overnight basis. During the year 2020, as DOD introduced process improvement by reducing manual intervention in the system, PIs were able to utilise additional time for their decision on Standing Facility due to the extension of the cut-off time for Standing Facility until 15:30 hours with effect from 06 July 2020.

6.2.3 Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR)

The SRR determines the minimum amount of reserves that each LCB should hold in terms of the provisions of the MLA, in the settlement account with the Central Bank, in proportion to the total rupee deposit liabilities of the respective bank. DOD is responsible for both administering the maintenance of statutory reserves as per the SRR and monitoring the compliance of LCBs in this regard. The SRR applicable to rupee deposit liabilities of commercial banks was reduced by 100 basis points to 4.00 per cent from 5.00 per cent with effect from 16 March 2020 and further by 200 basis points to 2.00 per cent from 4.00 per cent with effect from 16 June 2020. At the same time, the amount of Till cash, which is considered in the Statutory Reserve Requirement of LCBs, was reduced from 2.0 percent to 1.0 percent.

At the end of each day, the minimum amount of deposits required to be retained in the relevant reserve maintenance period in the Settlement Accounts maintained by the LCBs at the Central Bank was 90 per cent of the relevant reserve requirement. In order to make liquidity management more flexible for LCBs, the minimum daily deposit requirement in the reserve account with the Central Bank was reduced from 90 per cent to 20 per cent with effect from 16 April 2020. However, as before, at the end of the relevant reserve period, 100 per cent of the reserve requirement has to be met.

6.2.4 Bank Rate

The Bank Rate is a penalty rate which is higher than other market rates and is termed as Lender of Last Resort (LOLR) rate at which emergency loans are provided to LCBs under Section 87 of the MLA. The Bank Rate was reduced by 500 basis points to 10.00 per cent from 15.00 per cent with effect from 16 April 2020 in line with the relaxed monetary policy stance of the Central Bank and it was decided to allow it to automatically adjust in line with the SLFR, with a margin of +300 basis points. Accordingly, it was further reduced by a cumulative 150 basis points to 8.50 per cent with policy rate revisions on 06 May 2020 and 09 July 2020. However, the Central Bank did not lend funds to any LCB at these rates during 2020.

6.3 Banker to Commercial Banks and the Government

6.3.1 Accounts of Financial Institutions

LCBs and SPDs are connected to the monetary system through the settlement accounts with the Central Bank. These accounts are maintained at DOD to facilitate clearance of payments and settlements and also for settlements of payments for scripless securities transactions among RTGS participants. Further, LCBs use the same accounts for the purpose of maintaining their bank reserves. DOD is responsible for updating RTGS by accounting Multilateral Net Settlement Balances (MLNSB) of LCBs generated by LankaClear Pvt. Ltd (LCPL) during its 18 sessions on a daily basis. MLNSB consists of Cheque Images and Truncation System (CITS), Sri Lanka Interbank Payment System (SLIPS), Common ATM Switch (CAS), Common Electronic Fund Transfer Switch (CEFTS) and Common POS Switch (CPS). At the end of 2020, the DOD maintained RTGS accounts for 24 LCBs and 8 SPDs.

6.3.2 Government Accounts

In performing the functions relating to the role of the Central Bank as the banker to the Government, DOD continued to provide banking facilities to government departments, agencies and institutions, and certain foreign entities on behalf of the Government. As at end 2020, DOD maintained 49 such accounts, and more than 85 per cent of the transaction volume was in relation to the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury (DST) Account, the Public Debt Department’s Current Account, the Inland Revenue Commissioner’s VAT Refund Account and the President’s Fund Account.

In terms of Section 89 of the MLA, the Central Bank provides provisional advances to the Government, free of charge, with a ceiling of 10 per cent of the estimated government revenue approved by the Parliament for the financial year in which they are made. This advance is being used by the Government as a Revolving Credit facility, which shall be repayable within a period not exceeding six months. The limit of the provisional advances to the Government for fiscal year 2020 was initially fixed on the basis of previous year’s (2019) revenue estimate until the Government’s estimated revenue for the fiscal year 2020 was finalised. Later, the provisional advance to the Government for 2020 was changed to Rs. 154.72 billion as per the Government revenue estimate for the fiscal year 2020 approved by the Parliament.

6.4 Provision of Intra-Day Liquidity Facility

DOD continued its role to ensure smooth and efficient operation of the RTGS system by making available intra-day funding through the ILF to RTGS participants. This facility is provided free-of-charge against the collateral of Treasury bills and Treasury bonds, which are valued at their current market prices with sufficient hair cuts to absorb any variations in market prices during the day.

The total value and the average daily value of ILF drawn during the year amounted to Rs. 15,843 billion and Rs. 66.85 billion, respectively. This indicated an increase in ILF utilisation over that of the previous year, which amounted to a total of Rs. 15,241 billion with a daily average of Rs. 62.72 billion.

6.5 Supervision of Authorised Money Brokers

With the intention of promoting efficient price discovery in the domestic money market, the Money Broking Regulations No. 01 of 2013 was issued under Section 10 (c) of the MLA, which came into effect from 15 February 2013, empowering the DOD to oversee and supervise the operations of money brokers in Sri Lanka. Subsequently, the Money Broking Regulations No. 01 of 2018 was issued with effect from 05 March 2018, repealing the Money Broking Regulations No. 01 of 2013 as amended by the Money Broking Regulations No. 01 of 2016. Further, with effect from 14 February 2019, the Money Broking Regulations No. 01 of 2019 was issued incorporating several new additions namely, improving fit and proper requirements, restriction of control over money

7. ECONOMIC RESEARCH

Economic Research Department (ERD), one of the two key departments specially recognised in the Monetary Law Act (MLA) No. 58 of 1949, is vested with the responsibility of compiling data and conducting economic research for the guidance of the Monetary Board and the Governor in formulating, implementing, and executing policies and measures and for the information of the public as per Section 25 of the MLA. Accordingly, ERD continued to perform its duty of providing policy advice through research to guide the economy on a recovery path and to preserve economic and price stability in 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Performing the Central Bank’s role as the advisor on economic affairs to the Government, ERD provided policy advice on emerging economic issues under challenging circumstances. ERD published statutory and other publications on time, thereby disseminating information to stakeholders on economic conditions, along with various public awareness programmes with the fullest support of the staff, both working remotely and being physically present as and when required. ERD facilitated close cooperation with foreign counterparts and international agencies mostly through online platforms given the pandemic’s impact on mobility.

7.1 Maintaining Economic and Price Stability

ERD continued to compile, monitor and analyse trends, developments and projections in the monetary, external, real and fiscal sectors of the domestic economy as well as the global economy to facilitate proactive and timely monetary

policy decision making by the Monetary Board to maintain economic and price stability. Despite the challenging working environment due to lockdowns amidst the pandemic, ERD staff provided necessary inputs and analyses for the use of the Monetary Board and the management of the Central Bank. Measures were taken to improve the compilation and dissemination of monetary and interest rate statistics during 2020, including efforts towards automating the collection and the compilation of monetary and interest rate data, and the introduction of a new monthly survey on Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) to collect micro level data across various sectors of the economy. Further, as the Secretariat of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), ERD presented comprehensive reports to the MPC on economic and monetary conditions, including forward looking analyses supported by model based macroeconomic projections, enabling the MPC to make informed judgements and make necessary recommendations to the Monetary Board on the appropriate monetary policy stance of the Central Bank. Considering the immediate need of supporting economic activity amidst the pandemic, ERD facilitated unscheduled monetary policy announcements during the year. ERD coordinated the preparation of the annual policy statement, Road Map 2021 - Monetary and Financial Sector Policies for 2021 and Beyond, in which the Central Bank announced its broad policy framework for monetary and financial sectors in the medium term, thereby providing information and guidance on the policy direction of the Central Bank to financial markets and all stakeholders of the economy. To support the efforts of the Government to revive the economy amidst the pandemic, ERD also provided recommendations to the Monetary Board on the implementation of extraordinary measures within the scope of the provisions of the MLA. While continuing assessment of risks arising from macroeconomic developments and the possible impact of such risks on inflation and economic growth, ERD provided analyses on various measures implemented by the Government, highlighting their economic implications. Further, ERD continued to facilitate Monetary Policy Consultative Committee (MPCC) meetings with the view to strengthening the monetary policy decision making process with inputs from the experts in academia and the private sector. Moreover, ERD continued to improve its inhouse modelling and forecasting capacity by expanding the fiscal and external sector modules of the model-based Forecasting and Policy Analysis System (FPAS) as a part of the continuous effort in enhancing the monetary policy decision making and communication process. Further, ERD initiated several measures to improve external communication and enhance awareness among the general public and other stakeholders, thereby helping to anchor inflation expectations in line with the envisaged inflation path over the medium term. ERD continued the publication of regular press releases on Monetary Policy Review informing the general public of the stance of the Monetary Board and

Part II

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 87

facilitated the press conference proceedings, which were livestreamed via various online platforms enabling a wider reach of monetary policy communication on a real time basis. Amidst challenging circumstances, ERD facilitated the Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) framework of the Central Bank in the conduct of monetary policy, in addition to being the lead department in implementing an International Transaction Reporting System (ITRS) under the Central Bank’s bankwide strategic priorities.

7.2 Maintaining External Sector Stability

ERD continued to conduct comprehensive surveillance of global and domestic economic developments amidst external risks and vulnerabilities stemming from the challenging global environment created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Timely and appropriate policy advice and recommendations were provided to the MPC and the Monetary Board on external sector developments by collecting, compiling and analysing statistics related to international trade and external finance on a regular basis. Further, ERD monitored movements in exchange rate to identify any pressures on the rupee and recommended corrective measures to offset excessive volatility in the exchange rate as appropriate. Specifically, the Monetary Board was apprised of the developments in the domestic foreign exchange market amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in collaboration with International Operations Department. Further, ERD delivered presentations to the senior management on the external debt position of Sri Lanka, highlighting the concerns and way forward. Meanwhile, ERD continued to assess monetary implications of foreign loans obtained by the Government. Measures were also taken to improve the compilation and dissemination of external sector statistics to comply with internationally accepted data reporting standards. ERD continued the publication of Balance of Payments (BOP) statistics and International Investment Position (IIP) statistics in the BPM6 format on a quarterly basis, and the International Reserve Data Template (RDT) on a monthly basis, while submitting Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) to the World Bank and direct investment data for the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS) on an annual basis. With a view to supporting the maintenance of the external sector stability by ensuring the accuracy and timeliness of external sector data, ERD conducted several surveys during the year, including an Annual International Investment Survey (AIIS), to collect data on foreign assets and liabilities of the private sector and surveys related to trade in services covering resident and non resident airlines, shipping lines, telecommunication, construction and insurance sectors, and a monthly survey on inward workers’ remittances. Further, as the lead department responsible for the implementation of the ITRS, ERD coordinated with all Licensed Commercial Banks to improve technical aspects of the ITRS with the aim of monitoring both cross border and foreign currency transactions that take place through the banking sector. The ITRS is expected to be operationalised in 2022.

7.3 Providing Proactive Policy Advice

ERD performed a prominent role in providing policy advice to the Monetary Board, the Government and other stakeholders, mainly on monetary policy, exchange rate policy, international trade and fiscal sector related issues amidst the challenges posed by the pandemic. At the onset of the pandemic, the likely challenges that the economy would face were highlighted at various fora as well as in reports to the senior management and the Government. A report was submitted to the Government in June 2020 titled Proposals to Strengthen the Economic Recovery – Post COVID-19, containing proposals on all sectors of the economy to revive activity in the immediate aftermath of the lockdown measures. A comprehensive assessment of inequalities in income and asset distribution of Sri Lanka was submitted to the Government in September 2020, in collaboration with other government agencies. The September 15th Report, which is a confidential report on developments and risks in the economy with policy suggestions was submitted to the Hon. Minister of Finance by the statutory deadline in compliance with Section 116 (1) of the MLA. Providing necessary policy advice, Director of Economic Research (DER) served in several internal committees, including the MPC, the Market Operations Committee (MOC), the Financial System Stability Committee (FSSC), the Domestic Debt Management Committee (DDMC), Tender Boards for the issuance of government securities, Training Committee, Library Advisory Committee, and the Steering Committee for the Organisation of 70th Anniversary Celebrations of the Central Bank. In addition, DER served as an observer in the Internal Investment Oversight Committee (IIOC) and the International Reserve Investment Oversight Committee (IRIOC). DER and senior members of ERD made presentations at regular and special meetings, including the Monetary Board and meetings of Chairpersons and Chief Executive Officers of financial institutions, covering macroeconomic developments, issues and subjects of topical interest. The senior staff of ERD also extended their service at the MPC and several other internal committees. DER and senior staff of ERD represented the Central Bank in numerous committees and boards of external institutions, including the Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute (HARTI) and several committees appointed by His Excellency the President, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Public Services, Provincial Councils and Local Government, Ministry of Higher Education, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Trade, Ministry of Industries, and Ministry of Energy. Officers of ERD also represented the Central Bank in following committees: Project Committee on the Rehabilitation on the Northern Part of Elephant Pass Saltern, Committee to Conduct an Analysis on the Vehicle Assembly Industry, National Trade Facilitation Committee (NTFC), Government Finance Statistics (GFS) Coordinating Committee, Tariff Determination Committee, Advisory Committee on Trade Promotion and Information of Export Development Board, Committee on Implementation

7.4 Statutory Publications and Dissemination of Data and Information

ERD duly complied with the statutory requirements under the MLA by publishing the Annual Report of the Central Bank in all three languages with the assistance of other departments of the Central Bank. This annual flagship publication for the year 2019 was presented to the Hon. Minister of Finance and disseminated to the public by end April 2020. The other key annual publication of ERD, the half-yearly report on Recent Economic Developments - Highlights of 2020 and Prospects for 2021, was released in October 2020. ERD assisted the Governor to prepare the policy statement of the Central Bank, Road Map 2021 - Monetary and Financial Sector Policies for 2021 and Beyond, which was presented in a virtual setting on 04 January 2021 for the fourteenth consecutive year. At the same time, ERD ensured the availability of daily, weekly and monthly economic and financial information in the online data library of the Central Bank, while disseminating such information frequently via other media. With the aim of enhancing awareness of the general public, media statements were released on regular and emergency monetary policy reviews and external sector developments, which included statistics and updates covering monetary, interest rate, balance of payments, and other external sector information. Statistics covering all sectors of the economy were disseminated by ERD, adhering to the requirements of the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). In addition, considering the delay in publishing official national accounts statistics, ERD produced a report titled The Sri Lankan Economy on a Steady Recovery Path for the information of the public in September 2020.

7.5 Engaging in Policy Research and Knowledge Sharing

With a view to fostering research and analysis on subjects of contemporary importance, ERD continued to promote the research culture within the department and the Central Bank. The Research Advisory Panel (RAP), an internal committee within ERD, which is responsible for research related activities, continued to provide guidance to researchers while carrying out knowledge sharing activities throughout the year. ERD organised an international research workshop on Macroeconomic Stability and Economic Growth in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank Institute

(ADBI) and Asia Pacific Applied Economic Association (APAEA) to mark the 70th Anniversary of the Central Bank. At this workshop, ERD staff presented three research papers prepared jointly with researchers from APAEA. Further, ERD hosted the 6th SAARCFINANCE Database Seminar and Research Conference online on 16 July 2020. A paper on Revisiting Key Monetary Facts for SAARC Countries was presented by ERD officers at this conference. ERD also took part in SAARCFINANCE Webinar on Financial Inclusion.

(iii) Pre-Retirement Refund Scheme

In terms of the provisions in Employees Provident Fund (Amendment) Act No. 02 of 2012 and the subsequent procedures passed by the Parliament, payments under the 30 per cent EPF pre-retirement refund scheme has been in operation since 1 July 2015. During 2020, Rs. 9.7 billion was released to 19,247 beneficiaries under this scheme. The scheme is in high demand by beneficiaries, and since its inception, a sum of Rs. 98.2 billion has

been refunded to over 180,503 beneficiaries as at end 2020.

(iv) EPF Mobile Service Programme

EPF mobile services were planned for the year 2020 with a view towards enhancing the delivery of member services at their convenience and conducting public awareness on EPF operations. EPF mobile services offer almost all the services a member could obtain by visiting the EPF Department located in Colombo, in their own area or workplace. The services include issuing of EPF balance statements, amendment of EPF member details, amendment of EPF account details, re-registration of member details, promoting SMS & Internet member services, awareness for employers on electronic payments media such as e-media and direct debit system and providing advice on the overall EPF procedures.

During the first quarter of the year 2020, EPF Department conducted three (03) mobile services. However, conducting of mobile services during the subsequent months was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation in the country.

(v) EPF Contribution through Electronic Media

The e-Return system, which facilitates collection of EPF contributions and respective member details in electronic means was introduced by the Fund with the objective of improving its operational efficiency in a paperless operating environment. This system was operated on a voluntary basis until the EPF (Amendment) Act No. 02 of 2012 came into effect, making submission of EPF contribution details through electronic media mandatory for employers having more than 50 employees in their employment cadre. In 2011, Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) joined this system as facilitators to collect EPF contributions via their own online portals, which paved the way for a remarkable improvement in employer participation and a speedy member accounts updating process while strengthening its administrative and monitoring functionalities. The e-Return system achieved its highest technological breakthrough in 2016, with the introduction of the online member information validating mechanism, which brought 100 per cent process automation and real time updation of member accounts. Accordingly, eight LCBs are facilitating EPF online payments while four of them provide online member information validation and a real time member accounts updating facility for their customers.

The year 2020 was a remarkable year for EPF Department with regard to e-collection due to the introduction of a modification in the system

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 92

Part II

of crediting EPF contributions to the member accounts. With the implementation of the system, error-free contributions are credited to the members automatically upon the processing of the e-files with an automated reply for fund acknowledgement and details of member name discrepancies, if any. Further, with a view of introducing new methodologies for paying EPF, initiatives were taken to develop the EPF official website, enabling employers to submit their e-Returns through the website using the Common Electronic Fund Transfer (CEFT) System, which enables employers to pay monthly contributions from any participating bank.

By end 2020, the participation of employers in the e-Return submission system had increased to 10,069 from 9,267 in 2019, covering approximately 88 per cent of the active member accounts and approximately 88 per cent of the total monthly EPF contribution. In addition, actions were taken to make employers further aware of the e-Return submission procedure and its benefits for EPF stakeholders, while emphasising the importance of taking actions to rectify issues with regard to member name discrepancies of e–correspondences to assure that contributions are credited to member accounts in a timely manner.

(vi) Re-registration of EPF Members

The special project for re-registering member details in accordance with their details on their National Identity card (NIC), which was commenced by EPF Department in 2010, continued in the year 2020. This project was implemented in collaboration with the Department of Labour, with the intention of rendering an efficient service to both employers and employees. Accordingly, members were re-registered with the Fund as per the collected NIC details, and this is the preliminary work that is underway to accomplish a Member Centric Database that can be utilised by both institutions commonly through the facility of identifying each member by their NIC number as their Unique Identification Number. The statistical information on re-registered members during the year 2020 under this project is given below.

Table II-23Re-registration of Member Accounts

No. of Members Re-registered during the Year 2020

Total No. of Members Re-registered by the End of the Year 202024,1001,598,934

In addition, a procedure has been established to update the information of new members accurately. Accordingly, a monthly monitoring process is followed to collect the NIC information of the new members.

Although a Memorandum of Understanding was signed on 13.01.2020 with the Department of Registration of Persons (DRP) to facilitate EPF Department to access their corporate database and verify their NIC details to strengthen the re-registration process, since DRP has introduced a new methodology to make the process more efficient, EPF Department is currently in the process of signing a new Memorandum of Understanding in this regard.

(vii) Image Scanning Project

The Image Scanning Project (ISP) was implemented with a view towards improving the efficiency of services provided by the Fund by establishing a near-paperless operating system.

With the completion of Phase-I of the project, the traditional model of the EPF record room was converted into an e-Record room. All the Master File records, Form D and re-registration Documents were scanned, indexed and uploaded to the Document Management System. The document retrieval, file updating, notification and all other related functions have been made available for the departmental users on their own desktop. Most of the manual processes have been automated minimising the involvement of staff members. This transformation has resulted in a considerable saving of time, space and human resources.

Based on the process efficiencies gained through Phase-I, Phase-II of the project was initiated at the end of the year 2016 to digitise the other frequently used records. The digitisation of documents in Phase-II includes the following: Form C and C3 used for the collection of contributions from employers belonging to the years 2013, 2014 and 2015, refund worksheets from 2002 to 2015 except for the year 2013, Individual Employer Ledgers (IEL) for the period 1974 to 2015 (except year 2013), amendment letters from 2010 onwards and re-registration documents belonging to the year 2014. At the end of 2017, the scope of Phase-II of the project was extended to include the scanning and indexing of Form C & C3 belonging to the years 2016 & 2017. Accordingly, the above scope of the project was completed during the year 2018. The verification of the scanned images was completed in the year 2020.

Refund payment and part payment processes were made more efficient as all correspondences related to payments from 2001 were scanned and uploaded to the system. Other member services such as name amendment and re-registered member detail amendments are also being made efficient.

Part II

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020

Part II - 93

The department is in the process of making arrangements to expand the capacity of the document management server with a Disaster Recovery arrangement, and thereby initiating real time scanning of documents in order to digitise documents at the point of reception.

(viii) Other Services

The Public Relations and Inquiries Counter of EPF Department concluded a challenging year in 2020. During the year under review, the number of member/employer visits to the department was recorded as 102,383, while the department had received 55,123 member inquiries through telephone calls and 7,063 member inquiries through e-mails. The department had also received 2,097 letters in 2020 through members, employers and other stakeholders.

In year 2020, the Record Amendment Division attended to approximately 60,000 EPF records and EPF accounts amendments. A new Information Technology system has been introduced during the year, for tracking the status of amendments while keeping a log of supporting documents. The new system is updated with the status of amendment and progress notified to the member through a SMS text message. The Department of Labour accepts the SMS message received to the member as a proof of amendment and proceeds to confirm the identity of the member. This new system has improved the efficiency of the EPF record amendment process and the members were immediately informed about the progress of their requests.

(f) Other Functions

Furthermore, EPF is commenced reviewing and restructuring its investment strategy and framework under the Financial Sector Modernisation Project assisted by the World Bank and the Government of Sri Lanka.

Actions have been initiated for introducing web based and mobile applications for paying contributions and sending respective contribution details specifically targeting small and medium scale employers. This facility embedded the feature of automated member accounts updating upon a confirmation received for remittance contribution payments and intends to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the respective process.

9. FACILITIES MANAGEMENT

Facilities Management Department (FMD) has been entrusted with the key responsibility of maintaining and upgrading of buildings and properties of the Central Bank to facilitate and create a conducive working environment for its core functions to be carried out effectively. Towards

achieving this goal, FMD continued its key project of retrofitting the Head Office Building, which envisages a major refurbishment of the building interior as well as the replacement of the electro-mechanical plant and equipment. Several milestones of completing plant retrofits were achieved during this period with the replacement of the cold-water supply booster pumping systems, replacement of the standby generator control system of the Extension Building, and the installation of an IP based CCTV system to facilitate security surveillance of the entire Head Office premises. As a part of this project, the procurement process was initiated for the refurbishment of one of the toilet blocks and waterproofing of the roof terrace of the Head Office Building.

During the year under review, FMD continued the task of upgrading the building properties belonging to the Central Bank at the Centre for Banking Studies (CBS) in Rajagiriya, Regional Offices, and Holiday Homes. Taking the emerging requirements of a modern-day training facility into consideration, FMD initiated a major face-lifting project for the CBS Building to enhance its appearance and to provide modern smart classroom facilities in order to deliver better service to internal and external customers. Infrastructure facilities of the CBS premises were strengthened during the year with the replacement of passenger elevators and the replacement of the existing sewage pumping system. Refurbishment work at Regional Offices was continued with the installation of a security surveillance system and the replacement of the passenger elevator at the Regional Office in Anuradhapura. Further, upgrading of the power distribution system and the installation of a security surveillance system at the Regional Office in Nuwara Eliya were completed. A new standby generator was installed at the Holiday Home in Kataragama and necessary repairs were carried out to the water supply and sewage disposal systems of the premises. A new project was commenced to replace the existing Pantry Units at the Holiday Home in Nuwara Eliya, and color washing of the Holiday Home was also completed.

The year under review was a challenging year to FMD due to travel restrictions and social distancing requirements that were imposed due to the pandemic. FMD took initiatives to implement all COVID-19 protocols within the Central Bank building premises by imposing restrictions on the staff, visitors and tenants, and by taking various measures relevant to safeguarding the building staff and occupants from the spread of COVID-19, while addressing environmental, health and safety aspects. FMD, being the transport facilities provider to the Central Bank staff, made special arrangements to provide transport facilities to essential staff to report to duties in person, and to provide a dedicated transport service to the Central Bank staff to ensure minimal social contacts. In line with the decisions of the Monetary Board, FMD discontinued the lease agreements with the

The entities regulated by the Central Bank that come under the purview of FCRD are Licensed Commercial Banks, Licensed Specialised Banks, Licensed Finance Companies, Specialized Leasing Companies, Primary Dealers, and Participants of Payments and Settlement Systems.

From 2022, FCRD will focus on supervising standards of market conduct, formulating financial consumer protection

policies in line with the local and international market developments and best practices, taking proactive and reactive measures with respect to malpractices and misconducts whilst identifying and monitoring emerging vulnerabilities in issues related to financial consumer protection.

12. FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE UNIT

Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the Central Bank has continuously demonstrated its pursuit to achieve the objective of establishing an effective Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework in Sri Lanka, in close cooperation with national and international authorities since its inception. FIU, which was established in 2006 under the Financial Transactions Reporting Act No. 6 of 2006 (FTRA), functions as an independent statutory authority and acts as the lead AML/CFT regulator of the country. In addition, FIU has covered the majority of Financial Institutions (FIs) and Designated Non-Finance Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs) under the AML/CFT regime of the country in order to comply with the international standards on AML/CFT and Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations, and is supervised by FATF jointly with the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG). The key functions of FIU include collection and receipt of information on financial transactions for the purpose of detecting possible links to Money Laundering (ML), Terrorist Financing (TF), Proliferation Financing (PF) and other related unlawful activities defined in the FTRA, analysis of suspicious financial transactions relating to the above unlawful activities and dissemination of information of such analyses to relevant law enforcement authorities for investigation. The country’s AML/CFT regime also consists of two others major (pieces of) legislation, i.e. the Prevention of Money Laundering Act No. 5 of 2006 (PMLA) and the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act No. 25 of 2005 (CSTFA), where FIU is involved in implementing their provisions effectively.

12.1 Receipt, Analysis and Dissemination of Information

In terms of the mandatory requirements, during the year 2020, Reporting Institutions (RIs) continued to submit information on financial transactions, including suspicious transactions, through a web-based system, “LankaFin”, especially designed to assist in reporting on ML and TF. Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs), Licensed Specialised Banks (LSBs), Licensed Finance Companies (LFCs), Insurance Companies (ICs), Stock Brokers (SBs), and Money or Value

Part II

Transfer Service (MVTS) providers continued to report to FIU on Cash Transactions (CTRs) and Electronic Funds Transfers (EFTs) (both local and foreign) of Rs. 1.0 million and above each, or its equivalent in foreign currencies. Accordingly, in 2020, RIs reported 3.8 million (provisional) CTRs and 6.5 million (provisional) EFTs. In addition, Suspicious Transactions Reports (STRs) were reported to FIU by the RIs in terms of Section 7 of the FTRA. After operational and strategic analyses of received STRs, they were referred to Law Enforcement Authorities (LEAs) and Regulatory Authorities (RAs) for further investigation. 3,665 STRs were reported to FIU during 2020, and FIU disseminated a total of 2,801 STRs to LEAs and RAs for further investigations.

12.2 Regulation of Reporting Institutions

With a view to strengthening the AML/CFT supervision process and institutional compliance, FIU issues Regulations, Rules and Guidelines to FIs as well as DNFBPs. Accordingly, FIU issued several Guidelines during the year 2020 on “Scenario-based LankaFIN Reporting for LFCs, ICs and SBs”, “AML/CFT Compliance Obligations for Accountants and Trusts or Company Service Providers”, and “Non-Face-to-Face Customer Identification and Verification Using Electronic Interface Provided by the Department for Registration of Persons”.

Similarly, FIU took continuous measures to enhance compliance of RIs by effective monitoring and enforcement, onsite and offsite surveillance, raising awareness through seminars, and conducting compliance review meetings on AML/CFT to RIs. In line with that, FIU conducted 18 risk-based onsite examinations, including 7 follow-up examinations, and 16 spot examinations to FIs, as well as 18 risk-based onsite examinations to DNFBPs to assess compliance with the FTRA, Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Rules, and other regulations and rules issued by FIU. During 2020, several thematic reviews were also conducted on FIs as well as DNFBPs, due to the limitations that were experienced in conducting planned onsite examinations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic situation in the country.

Further, during 2020, FIU undertook other regulatory actions regarding AML/CFT non-compliances by FIs and DNFBPs, such as imposing penalties, issuing warning letters and show cause letters, issuing time-bound action plans, and conducting follow-up meetings. Moreover, FIU imposed financial penalties amounting to Rs. 3.3 million on 5 LFCs for the year 2020.

12.3 Domestic and International Cooperation

(a) Memoranda of Understanding

As per Section 15 (1) (r) of the FTRA, FIU is vested with the legal authority to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with any government institution or agency with respect to the exchange of information.

Accordingly, during 2020, FIU entered into an MOU with the Chief of National Intelligence with a view to sharing information to facilitate the analysis process of FIU. Accordingly, the total number of MOUs signed with domestic agencies by FIU increased to 12 as at end 2020.

Further, in terms of Sections 16 and 17 of the FTRA, FIU can enter into agreements for the exchange of information regularly with any institution or agency of a foreign state with the approval of the Minister of Finance. Accordingly, negotiations were initiated to sign MOUs with 2 foreign FIUs during 2020.

(b) Egmont Group

FIU obtained assistance from members of the Egmont Group, the Association of global FIUs consisting of 166 members, in order to carry out investigations and collaborate with member countries to gather intelligence on their investigations. During 2020, FIU responded to 34 requests from counterpart FIUs and made 34 requests from counterpart FIUs to share information relating to on-going investigations. Further, FIU officers participated in the Egmont Working Group meetings held in Mauritius in January 2020. However, as a result of the circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Egmont Group Plenary, originally scheduled for July 2020, was postponed to July 2021.

(c) Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG)

Due to the pandemic, the APG did not conduct its annual plenary in 2020. However, FIU participated in several virtual Mutual Evaluation Committee (MEC) meetings held during the year, mainly to discuss the members’ mutual evaluation reports and follow-up reports.

The Follow-up Mutual Evaluation Report on Sri Lanka was discussed at the virtual MEC held in October 2020. Out of 40 Recommendations, Recommendation 14 on Money or Value Transfer Service Providers, which was rated as non-compliant in 2015, was re-rated to Largely Compliant with the progress reported, and the Largely Compliant rating given in 2015 to Recommendation 15 on New Technologies was re-rated to Partially Compliant due to the fact that Sri Lanka had not taken actions to fulfil the new requirements imposed by the FATF in October 2019. Accordingly, out of 40 FATF recommendations, by end 2020, Sri Lanka’s ratings stood as, 7 Compliant, 24 Largely Compliant, 8 Partially Compliant, and 1 Non-Compliant.

12.4 Institutional Capacity Building and Awareness Programmes

Awareness building is vital for the establishment of an effective AML/CFT regime in the country. Accordingly, continuing the efforts to enhance the awareness on detecting,

analysing and reporting of ML and TF related transactions, 19 awareness/training programmes were conducted during the year, accommodating 1,881 participants. This included face-to-face programmes as well as online programmes. FIU initiated a series of measures to further strengthen the LEAs’ efforts in combating ML related to the illicit drug trade, to increase the awareness of ML investigations among investigating officers of Sri Lanka Police, and to continuously coordinate with investigators, prosecutors and FIs to support the LEAs’ efforts. A workshop was also conducted to enhance awareness of suspicious financial transactions related to drug trafficking for the board of directors and the senior management of licensed banks.

Furthermore, several high-level workshops and web conferences were organised by FIU for the board of directors and the senior management of licensed banks and LFCs to enhance awareness of their obligations on AML/CFT compliance. The Resident Advisor from the US Department of Treasury also continued to provide technical assistance to improve the quality and effectiveness in FIU operations, AML/CFT supervision and AML/CFT case management.

14. HUMAN RESOURCES

The strategic objective of Human Resources Department (HRD) is to ensure the availability of a highly productive, motivated and contended team of employees, who contribute towards achieving the overall objectives of the Central Bank, amidst emerging challenges. Considering skill development and capacity building as an integral part of the human resources management, the functions of Training and Development Department were absorbed into HRD during 2020, thereby enabling the effective coordination of training and development to match competency requirements of employees. In line with the strategies identified in the Strategic Plan of the Central Bank, HRD continued to perform its key functions, such as recruitment, training and development, performance evaluation, succession planning, promotions, and maintaining industrial harmony, creating a conducive environment with good employer-employee relations.

With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and the resultant mobility restrictions imposed by the health authorities, HRD took measures to ensure a safe working environment for employees while ensuring uninterrupted operations of the Bank. Accordingly, arrangements were made to facilitate Central Bank employees to ‘Work from Home’, and HRD issued guidelines on working arrangements as well as on health and safety measures that were required to be adhered with, in line with the guidelines issued by the health authorities from time to time. Further, arrangements were made to carry out a survey on a continuous basis to assess the vulnerability and risk exposure of Central Bank employees to COVID-19, in line with the guidelines issued by the health authorities as and when required.

HRD carried out the employee performance evaluation process as planned during the year. Accordingly, the performance evaluation for the year 2019 was completed and marks were communicated to all Heads of department and the relevant employees. Further, HRD issued a circular to conduct the mid-year performance review process of all departments. It provided an opportunity for all relevant parties to understand the level of performance of staff members during the first half of the year.

(c) Promotions

In line with the applicable promotion criteria, HRD facilitated the granting of promotions, ensuring the carrier progression of employees. A total of 126 staff members were granted their class and grade promotions in 2020. This included three Assistant Governors who were promoted as Deputy Governors, two Senior Heads of Departments who were promoted as Assistant Governors, 17 Deputy Heads of Departments who were promoted as Additional Heads of Departments, and 104 other employees who were granted their class and grade promotions.

(d) Training and Skills Development

HRD identifies training needs, formulates strategies to fill up training gaps, prepares and implements the annual training plan, facilitates the staff to pursue postgraduate studies, and provides opportunities for foreign/local short term training for the staff, to meet emerging needs of human capital development of the Central Bank.

The Central Bank defrays the cost of postgraduate studies in Sri Lanka or abroad of employees of the Central Bank, and accordingly, in 2020, HRD facilitated 10 staff class officers to embark on postgraduate programmes in reputed universities in Australia and the United Kingdom, while, two officers commenced Master’s degree programmes in local universities on a part-time basis. The number of officers who have commenced/completed postgraduate studies under the Central Bank Scholarship Programme during the period 2016-2020 is given in Table II - 28.

During the year, HRD facilitated 325 officers to participate in 54 local training programmes conducted by reputed local training institutions, while facilitating 159 officers to participate in 19 local training programmes conducted by Centre for Banking Studies (CBS). Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the institutions conducted their programmes online. In addition, HRD facilitated the Central Bank employees to follow local long term (part-time) training programmes, as it continued its sponsorship scheme for the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) qualification.

HRD also facilitates knowledge sharing among the staff of the Central Bank and other Central Banks, and accordingly, conducted knowledge sharing sessions with the Bank of Korea in 2020 in the field of Macroeconomics.

(e) Job Rotation

A policy on job rotation has been established for transferring employees below SC Grade III (2) annually, with a view of providing opportunities for the employees to groom themselves in several areas of experience of the operations of the Bank. However, only 27 employees in OAC were transferred under this rotation policy in 2020 due to the delay in recruitments of required human capital caused by the COVID-19 outbreak during the year 2020.

(f) Industrial Harmony

HRD continued to perform its role as the facilitator for maintaining a closer dialogue between Management and the Trade Unions of the Central Bank. Accordingly, four discussions were arranged in 2020, giving the opportunity to Management and the Trade Unions to discuss and resolve some of the issues relating to remuneration, promotions, training, welfare, recruitment, work arrangements under the prevailing pandemic situation, and general administration of the Bank.

14.4 Closing Down and Establishment of Departments

15. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

Information Technology Department (ITD) successfully managed the technological challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and continued to contribute towards accomplishing the core objectives of the Central Bank. ITD’s dynamic role of providing enterprise level integrated applications to the Bank continued in the same vein even during such challenging times.

During the year, ITD provided its services under five major areas, namely, (a) delivering cost-effective business solutions; (b) continuous enhancements of the IT infrastructure of the Bank; (c) contribution to modernise national payment system infrastructure; (d) IT security and resilience; and (e) upgrading ICT competencies among the staff under strategic and operational activities of the Bank.

(a) Delivering cost-effective business solutions

The Central Integrated Market Monitor (CIMM), the system which monitors the Foreign Exchange Market and the Domestic Money Market, was further enhanced as a response to the new requirements arising due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A new Import Trade Information data capturing and monitoring module and development of an interface for licensed banks and Domestic Operations Department (DOD) to view and manage security allocation details of COVID-19 relief loans were successfully incorporated into CIMM.

In order to ensure transparency and to improve the overall effectiveness of the Treasury Bill auction process, a new Treasury Bill Auction System was developed for the Public Debt Department (PDD) by incorporating a voluntary second phase of bidding.

ITD eliminated inefficiencies related to stock keeping within departments through the implementation of a new and improved Inventory Management System for Secretariat Department (SD) and Facilities Management Department (FMD).

ITD developed an internal file sharing system, ShareDoc, with features of a mail application and One Time Password (OTP) verification, to ensure secure and confidential transmission of the Central Bank’s internal files among its employees. It was further extended for the usage of external parties to share documents with supervision departments of the Bank. This application significantly contributed to mitigate any vulnerabilities that may have arisen from the pandemic induced work culture during the year under review.

The FinNet System, which is the Central Database System used by several departments to monitor information reported by the financial institutions regulated by the Bank, was upgraded by migrating to a more secure and stable new environment, involving a substantial amount of platform accommodating re-development. Further,

several new returns were introduced to collect data from Dealer Direct Participants and Non-Bank Financial Institutions. In addition, users of relevant departments were trained to perform data analysis and report generation by themselves, using a cutting-edge data analytic and visualisation tool.

DOD’s operations related to the managing of Standing Lending Facility (SLF) and Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) were streamlined through system modifications enabling more automation in its processes. In addition, a Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) message viewing system was implemented for DOD to remotely access SWIFT related information online, eliminating the need to view traditional paper based reports.

ITD accommodated new loan schemes of Regional Development Department (RDD) and DOD in its systems, further developing a web application to manage Saubagya COVID-19 Renaissance loan applications received from licensed banks.

Currency Department (CRD), which manages the currency printing, coins minting, and currency issuing, was provided with an automated currency valuation process in the Currency Management System (CMS), based on the weighted average cost methodology, enabling CRD to value its inventories more accurately and facilitate more informed decision making related to currency in stock.

ITD extended its services to the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) by implementing a new member contribution processing module covering both C-Form and e-media contributions. An integrated payment solution with LankaClear was also made ready to commence with the launch of the new EPF website. Further, a module to monitor name and account amendments was implemented along with an integrated SMS feature facilitating EPF members to obtain services in a prompt and hassle-free manner.

ITD managed to successfully incorporate the new Advanced Personal Income Tax (APIT) scheme introduced by the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) to its internal systems, facilitating employees’ consent based tax deduction. Related statutory requirements incorporating both APIT and PAYE tax schemes were completed timely, while assisting Finance Department (FD) with all data requirements including the annual Audit, Acturial and Budget procedures. ITD also provided Finance Department (FD) with a system to accommodate Internal Fund Management-Front Office operations, automating the generation of deal tickets and related functionalities. The system further benefits back-office operations through timely visibility of front-office documents.

A Vehicle Requisition System was developed for FMD to streamline and automate the manual process so far used by employees in reserving transport for official matters.

Employees are now able to submit vehicle requests via the system and are even able to share a ride with another officer with similar travel requirements, which in turn reduces peak time disappointments and facilitates a more cost-effective option for the Bank simultaneously.

In addition to the above completed projects, ITD initiated and progressed with several other new system implementations and enhancements vital to the Bank, within the year 2020.

ITD progressed with implementing a Regional Development Loan Management System to cater to the 4P (Public-Private-Producer Partnerships) Loan Scheme, completing its loan processing and refinancing modules for RDD.

To ease complications related to the present manual performance evaluation process, ITD initiated the development of an Online Performance Evaluation System. Modules for Goal Assignment and Performance Evaluation were completed within the reviewed period.

In addition to the above, ITD significantly contributed to the procurement process of the Reserve Management System (RMS) by providing professional expertise in evaluating technical aspects of responses for the tender. Further, ITD was actively involved in the initial scoping phase and configuration and design phase of the system implementation. In addition, ITD was able to procure and configure the required hardware for the RMS as per the project schedule, within a short period of time. ITD also contributed to the procurement of an integrated IT system for Centre for Banking Studies to replace manual operations of the operational clusters through an automated, secure and easy-to-use solution.

Further, ITD expanded the use of the Document Management System (DMS) to SD and CRD by digitizing physical documents, eliminating persistent challenges arising from dealing with them. The document digitization process was extended to FIU and the Board Secretariat during the year.

(b) Continuous enhancements of the ICT infrastructure

Continuous upgrading and ensuring the resiliency of the ICT infrastructure of the Central Bank remained a core objective of ITD and hence, systems were thoroughly monitored and improved during the year to be on par with the latest advancements in technology.

In response to the sudden challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic, the most critical task in terms of ICT infrastructure was to readily provide an efficient and secure Work From Home (WFH) facility for the employees of the Bank. ITD overcame this challenge successfully by enabling users to connect to the Bank’s network and continue the business activities remotely using Virtual Private Network

(VPN) portals and other secure connection mechanisms complying with industry standards. ITD connected more than 500 users through VPN portals and provided prompt technical support for the same, continuously, thereby ensuring a smooth and hassle-free WFH environment to its users.

ITD progressed with the revamping of the existing Head Office Data Centre to modern TIA 942 Rating 3 complied level. ITD completed the Bid evaluation process and awarded the Tender and completed the design of the Data Centre during the year under review. ITD also progressed with establishing a disk based data backup system for the Central Bank Head Office and its Disaster Recovery (DR) site. The team managed to implement the said system using existing hardware for the servers of the Head Office and completed replicating all data on new storage devices.

ITD managed to extend the e-mail cluster to the DR site by purchasing relevant storage devices and servers. Required Data Replications were also completed during the reviewed period.

Moreover, even during the challenging pandemic situation, ITD constantly maintained the availability of critical systems and critical infrastructure above 99.5% on par with industry standards.

(c) Contribution to Modernise National Payment System Infrastructure

ITD extended its services as an advisor and provided technical expertise for projects of national interest. ITD officials contributed their expertise to several national projects during the year.

ITD significantly contributed towards the RTGS Modernisation Project by providing technical expertise for the preparation of Request for Proposal (RFP) document in order to initiate the procurement process. Further, to strengthen the secondary market of government securities, action was initiated to establish an Electronic Trading Platform (ETP) and a Clearing House with a Central Counter Party (CH/CCP) solution. ITD officers assessed the existing market infrastructure with the consultant and assisted in the preparation of an inception report and a gap analysis report for the same. The team was also able to finalise the target operating model of the proposed system and is in the process of providing input for the drafting of the RFP.

(d) Strengthening IT Security and Resilience

During the year, ITD enhanced its IT security framework and executed several proactive measures to ensure that the Bank’s systems are protected against any cybersecurity threat.

ITD drafted an Information Security Governance Framework to prioritise and properly manage any vulnerabilities that may pose a risk to the IT systems of the Bank. Further, vulnerability assessments were carried out for the Corporate and EPF websites with the assistance of the Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (SLCERT). The Information Security Maturity Assessment was also completed for the year under review. In addition, ITD also initiated to conduct an external security assessment for the critical systems to further ensure the safety and the preparedness of its technical infrastructure.

ITD upgraded its servers to the latest versions and improved the security and resilience of the same, ensuring overall safety of the IT infrastructure of the Central Bank, thereby providing a safe zone of access to any remote user connecting to the Bank network via external devices.

(e) Upgrade ICT Competencies among the Staff

To build a more technologically savvy and threat-ready community within the Bank, ITD continued to publish awareness banners on the intranet and circulate security advisory alerts through email to the staff of the Central Bank.

Further, the staff of ITD continued to improve their skills and knowledge through active participation in webinars and other virtual workshops and conferences organised both locally and internationally, uplifting their capacity to ensure that the Bank’s systems are reliant on and monitored by an updated and skilled workforce.

16. INTERNAL AUDIT

The internal audit function has been in operation in the Central Bank since 1951. The mission, scope of work, authority, responsibility, accountability and the independence of the Director and the staff of the Internal Audit Department (IAD) have been included in the Internal Audit Charter approved by the Monetary Board. In conducting audits, Global Standards are followed. A summary of the activities carried out by the Department during 2020 is given below.

16.1 Internal Audit Plan

Strategic Internal Audit Plan for 2021 – 2023 and Annual Audit Plan for 2021 were compiled during the year.

16.2 Conduct of Audit Assignments

(a) Process and Information Systems Audits

In 2020, process and information systems audits were conducted. Each audit engagement was carried out in four sequential steps, i.e. planning, performing, communicating audit results and taking resolution actions. A three-step process was followed for the communication of audit results, i.e. conducting closing conference with Auditee Department to get audit observations validated, issuing of draft audit report

and issuing of the final report. Implementation of audit recommendations by process owners was also followed-up during the year.

(b) Progress of the Conduct of Audits

Progress of the conduct of audit assignments was reported to the Monetary Board Advisory Audit Committee (AAC) and the Monetary Board. Audit reports were submitted to the Superintendent of the National Audit Office through the AAC.

(c) Submission of Internal Audit Reports to the Ministry of Finance (MOF)

During the year, Internal Audit Reports were submitted to the Director General of the Management Audit Department of the MOF as requested and in line with the National Audit Act No. 19 of 2018.

16.3 Awareness Programmes and Provisioning of Training

IAD conducted a presentation for the Audit Coordinating Officers on the ‘Internal Audit Facilitation Guidelines’. A Guest Auditor Presentation on ‘Importance of Cyber Security under New Normal’ was conducted by an expert in the field for the benefit of all the staff of the Bank in 2020. Further, as per the request of Human Resources Department, IAD continued to provide training on internal audit and related disciplines to undergraduates during the year.

16.4 Facilitation of the Monetary Board Advisory Audit Committee

AAC is a sub-committee appointed by the Monetary Board which advises the Monetary Board on financial reporting, internal controls, internal audit, external audit and any other matters assigned by the Monetary Board. The Secretary to the Monetary Board is the Secretary to the AAC. The Director of IAD functions as the Assistant Secretary to the AAC. Accordingly, IAD provided secretarial facilitation to the AAC during the year.

17. INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

As per the Monetary Law Act (MLA) No. 58 of 1949, the Central Bank is responsible for managing the official foreign exchange reserves of the country. In this regard, International Operations Department (IOD) is entrusted to perform the function of managing the official foreign exchange reserves and monitoring domestic foreign exchange market activities to ensure their smooth operation.

17.1 International Reserves Management

Part II

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 107

(a) Structural Reserve Management

Since 2016, the Central Bank has been involved with the Reserve Advisory and Management Programme (RAMP) of the World Bank, which provides advisory services and training to official sector investment managers, enabling efficient management of foreign currency reserves and other investment portfolios. Accordingly, a model based Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) is adopted by the Central Bank based on its liability structure, which mainly considers the objectives of capital preservation, liquidity requirements, income generation and its risk tolerance. Accordingly, the foreign reserves of the Central Bank are objectively divided into three main tranches, which comprise different portfolios and are assigned with an investment horizon, currency composition and an asset composition.

(b) External Manager for Central Bank Reserves

Since 2016, under the RAMP, the World Bank Treasury has been the external manager for the Central Bank reserve management with a pre-defined mandate and a portfolio of USD 200 million.

(c) SWAP Facility of US dollars 400 Million from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)

In order to build up the foreign reserves, the Central Bank obtained funds amounting to US dollars 400 million under the bilateral currency swap agreement signed between the Central Bank and the RBI in July 2020.

(d) Debt Repayments of the Government

Debt repayments of the Government are usually settled using the Government’s foreign reserves. However, as the Government could not raise adequate liquidity owing to the unprecedented adverse market conditions, the Central Bank continued to provide liquidity from the foreign reserves of the Central Bank since 08 April 2020 to settle Government debts, and accordingly, from 08 April 2020 to 31 December 2020, the Central Bank settled US dollars 3,555 million of Government debt utilising the Central Bank’s foreign reserves. In addition, the Central Bank obtained a Repo Facility for US dollar 1,000 million from Federal Reserve Bank New York, to meet the contingent liquidity needs of the Government.

17.2 Performance Analysis and Facilitation Activities

(a) Compilation of Foreign Reserves and Performance Measurement of Reserve Management Activities

IOD compiles and reports on the Central Bank Reserve and Gross Official Reserve figures daily, whilst assessing the performance of reserve management activities on a total return approach and presents to the Monetary Board on a quarterly basis. The returns of Fixed Income

Securities (FIS) and Money Market (MM) Investments are measured against respective benchmarks according to the SAA approved by the Monetary Board.

(b) New Reserve Management System (RMS)

In 2020, IOD completed the procurement process for acquiring a new RMS as the license for the existing TMS is to be expired by late 2021.

(c) Registration with the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) Know Your Customer (KYC) Registry

During 2020, as a measure of adopting the international standards for KYC review, the Central Bank was successfully registered with the SWIFT KYC Registry which is a standard global KYC Data Repository.

17.3 Domestic Foreign Exchange Market Developments

Despite the series of catastrophic events triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, IOD made continuous efforts to ensure smooth operations in the domestic foreign exchange (FX) market, allowing reasonable flexibility while curbing excessive volatility in the exchange rate.

(a) Intervention in the Domestic Foreign Exchange (FX) Market

The Central Bank continued to intervene in the domestic FX market through the Request for Quote (RFQ) mechanism, under disorderly market conditions especially during the challenging times of COVID-19 in April and November 2020 in order to curb the undue volatility in the exchange rate. Further, the Central Bank was able to purchase FX from the market during the conducive time to support building up reserves. At the same time, Sell-Buy Swap auctions were introduced as an alternative intervention mechanism, to address the temporary liquidity shortage in the domestic FX market without depleting the forex reserves.

(b) Dissemination of Information

IOD continued to publish the USD/LKR indicative exchange rate along with indicative exchange rates for fifty-six world currencies and average Telegraphic Transfer (TT) buying and selling exchange rates of Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) against LKR for nine major currencies, on the Central Bank website daily. In addition, IOD disseminated information on exchange rates to Government organisations and various other parties including the general public at their requests.

(c) Ensured the Orderly Behaviour of the Market Conduct

Given the nebulous conditions that emerged as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, some stringent measures were taken by IOD to identify speculative behaviours of some LCBs and to truncate the Net Open

Part II

Position (NOP) limits applicable to foreign exchange operations temporarily, to facilitate smooth operations in the domestic FX market, on a case by case basis. At the same time, regulatory actions were taken in order to avoid the misbehaviour of some market participants, as appropriate.

(d) Observations on Market Sentiments

In the context of challenges faced by the unexpected emergence of the global COVID-19 pandemic, as the department responsible for monitoring the domestic FX market activities, IOD provided its views, observations and recommendations for various proposals, regulations, amendments and policy matters submitted by other departments of the Central Bank and external organisations throughout 2020, regarding the possible implications of such proposals on the exchange rate movements.

(e) Affiliation with Market Participants

IOD conducted a series of meetings with Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), in order to facilitate FX purchases by CPC and different options for oil procurement.

(f) Initiatives to attract FX Flows

With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and also due to the consecutive sovereign rating downgrades by the global rating agencies, foreign exchange inflows to the country were declined. Therefore, in order to address the FX liquidity shortage in the market, IOD introduced to offer medium to long term USD/LKR zero cost Buy-Sell Currency Swaps to Licensed Banks as a hedging instrument to encourage foreign investors to bring foreign exchange into the country. At the same time, IOD supported in implementing the new scheme introduced under the Government’s Budget 2021 to pay extra Rs.2.00 for each US dollar converted from workers’ remittances in order to attract more workers’ remittances.

(g) Supporting the Capital Market Development Project (CMDP) of the Central Bank

In order to develop the domestic FX market and to improve the market monitoring activities of the Central Bank, IOD continued to provide contributions and inputs to the CMDP.

18. LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE

Legal and Compliance Department (LCD) was established with a view to safeguarding the interests of the Central Bank and ensuring compliance with all laws and procedures in the discharge of duties entrusted to it. LCD is charged with the duty to develop new laws and to review and propose suitable amendments to the existing laws administered by it, with a view to enhancing the regulatory and supervisory sphere of the Central Bank, transparency and accountability standards thereof, within an effective compliance framework.

Amidst many challenges faced by the Central Bank during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic which caused several setbacks in the overall economy, requiring a large number of regulatory measures to be taken to arrest the situation, LCD extended the required assistance by developing the legal and regulatory framework of the Central Bank to suit the situation.

LCD contributed in introducing law reforms to major pieces of legislation administered by the Central Bank, namely the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988 and the Finance Business Act No. 42 of 2011, with the objective of strengthening and enhancing the regulatory and supervisory powers vested therein. Accordingly, the new Banking Act would provide for a stronger legal foundation for regulation and supervision of systemically important banks, an effective resolution regime for licensed banks and enhanced governance requirements. Amendments to the Finance Business Act No. 42 of 2011 are aimed at enhancing regulatory and supervisory powers on non-bank financial institutions. In addition to that, LCD engaged in drafting amendments to the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance No. 7 of 1937 and the Finance Leasing Act No.56 of 2000.

With a view to augmenting the country’s capital market infrastructure to an internationally competitive level, which will in turn re-designate Sri Lanka’s position as an investor-friendly country, multiple initiatives were taken by the Central Bank under the Capital Market Development Project. This project has inter alia aimed at introducing new laws on Netting and Clearing and insolvency, the establishment of a central counterparty and an electronic trading platform for securities trading, a larger portion of which requires serious changes to be made to the existing legal framework applicable for the capital market. LCD engaged in this project throughout the year.

LCD played a major role in the preparation of subordinate pieces of legislation to be introduced under the statutes administered by the Central Bank. Accordingly, LCD drafted such instruments as well as amendments to such instruments in respect of the areas covered by the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance No. 8 of 1923, Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance No. 7 of 1937, Finance Leasing Act No.56 of 2000, Finance Business Act No. 42 of 2011 and the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988. With a view to enhancing the institutional governance framework, LCD further worked on improving the Codes of Conduct applicable to employees and members of the Monetary Board. As a result of these endeavours, the employees will have the benefit of a more user friendly and comprehensive code. The Whistle Blowing Policy of the Central Bank was further reviewed and redrafted considering the views expressed by stakeholders.

During the COVID-19 pandemic situation in 2020, LCD was largely involved in numerous regulatory measures adopted by the Central Bank to revive the economy and to support affected businesses and individuals of the country. Accordingly, LCD continued drafting and advising

Part II

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 109

on administrative and contractual instruments to facilitate interaction with numerous domestic and international stakeholders.

In order to ensure the Central Bank’s compliance with the provisions of the Right to Information Act No. 12 of 2016, as a public authority, a dedicated Right to Information (RTI) Unit, established within LCD, handled an increasing number of requests for information, responding to 132 requests and 9 appeals relating to the Central Bank during 2020.

LCD successfully handled litigations filed for and against the Monetary Board, the Central Bank, or its employees, in consultation with the relevant authorities. Several regulatory actions were taken on distressed non-bank financial institutions with a view to safeguarding the interest of the depositors and creditors. LCD continued initiating litigation relating to unauthorised finance companies, prohibited schemes, winding up of finance companies whose licences have been cancelled by the Monetary Board and such other issues in the financial sector under the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988, the Finance Business Act No. 42 of 2011 and other statutes, for the purpose of maintaining the resilience and confidence of the public towards the financial system.

Despite the adverse effects of the pandemic situation, 2020 was a year that exposed opportunities to take many regulatory initiatives focusing on novel concepts in central banking, new technology and expanding the regulatory sphere in the virtual environment. Accordingly, LCD represented several internal and external committees and task forces inter alia, to identify the irregularities and illegalities of the finance leasing business industry, to procure new operating system for reserve management, to introduce distributed ledger systems to financial institutions via Block-chain technology and introducing Electronic Know Your Customer (E-KYC) assessment process, to enhance the marketability of Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDB) via scripless forms thereof, to develop an open banking framework in Sri Lanka, and to study the virtual currency schemes in Sri Lanka.

Furthermore, with a view to minimising the legal, compliance and operational risks in the Central Bank activities involving internal and external parties, LCD was actively involved in providing legal opinions, observations on various legal instruments and issues, ensuring that all actions and decisions are taken by the Central Bank considering the procedural propriety, transparency and accountability, as a public body.

In order to strengthen the compliance framework, the Central Bank joined the SWIFT KYC Registry in 2020, which is a global database designed to facilitate anti-money laundering legal and regulatory requirements of its members. LCD was involved in submitting compliance related information of the Central Bank to this Registry with a view to initiating compliance assessments of its foreign counterparties via this database.

Moreover, in order to enhance public awareness on certain issues, such as prohibited schemes, unauthorised finance business, and evolving issues in the finance and leasing sector, LCD contributed resource persons to educate the general public of such concerns and to avoid them from unduly entangling themselves in such illegal activities.

19. MACROPRUDENTIAL SURVEILLANCE

Macroprudential Surveillance Department (MSD) conducts a wide range of analyses, some of which complement microprudential supervision, to assess the build up of systemic risks within the financial system of the country with a view of facilitating the Central Bank to achieve one of the two statutory objectives of maintaining financial system stability. In addition, MSD assesses macro-financial linkages to identify the impact of macroeconomic developments on the domestic financial system and its stability. Macroprudential surveillance is carried out using data reported by regulated financial institutions and data collected by MSD from other sources. The surveillance outcome of the department facilitates the policy formulation process of the Central Bank to mitigate systemic risks. A summary of the main activities undertaken by MSD during 2020 is given below.

(a) Macroprudential Surveillance

Macroprudential surveillance is conducted to identify build up of systemic risks in the financial sector and to assess the resilience of the financial system to such risks. The surveillance framework analyses risks emanating from global and domestic macroeconomic developments, financial market activities and the financial institutions sector using the data reported by regulated financial institutions and data collected by MSD from other sources. In addition, assessment of household and non-household sector debt dynamics and corporate sector risk profiles assist to evaluate the impact of macro level developments on financial system stability. MSD also continued to compile a number of composite financial system stability indicators based on the stability and soundness of different sub sectors of the domestic financial system while also taking steps to improve the reliability of these indices. In addition, the banking sector and licensed finance companies sector top-down macro stress testing continued during the year to assess the impact of credit risk, interest rate risk, and foreign exchange risk on the level of capital of the banking system and also individual banks. Several board papers were submitted by the department to the Monetary Board with risk assessments highlighting possible threats to the stability of the financial system, and other contemporary concerns over financial system stability during 2020.

While macroeconomic and financial developments affect corporate sector performance and balance sheets, cohesive behaviour of corporates or the behaviour of

systemically important corporates could in turn influence the macroeconomy and the financial system. Therefore, with a view of addressing the need for a comprehensive assessment on the risks emanating from the corporate sector to financial system stability, MSD introduced scenario stress testing to corporate sector risk profiles. MSD also developed an interconnectedness analysis which evaluates the contagion risks of the banking sector. The Financial Stress Index, a new stability indicator, was constructed by MSD during the year to identify periods when strains on the financial system impair its intermediation function. This index combines indicators from the equities market, bond market, foreign exchange market and banking sector into a composite index to assess the degree of stress in the financial system. MSD expanded the scope of stress testing further by initiating a liquidity stress testing framework in the banking sector and the licensed finance companies sector during the year 2020 and intends to introduce a dynamic stress testing framework in 2021.

The Central Bank obtained Technical Assistance (TA) from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to expand the breadth and depth of the macroprudential surveillance framework in Sri Lanka. The TA project financed by the Financial Sector Stability Fund (FSSF) commenced in August 2020 to promote a dynamic and resilient financial sector for sustainable growth by enhancing the systemic risk monitoring mechanism. Under this TA program, it is envisaged that improvements would be made to data collection and analysis, the depth of the stress testing functionality via International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) based dynamic stress tests, improving risk surveillance by enhancing the forward-looking element, the calibration of policy instruments, and improving the governance structure of macroprudential policy making. Accordingly, the first batch of data collection on interconnectedness and stress testing related to credit risk was initiated by MSD by developing structured templates and reporting guidelines with the support of the TA received from the IMF to collect the required granular data and issuing the same to licensed banks in December 2020. Further, MSD intends to conduct its second batch of data collection on market risk, interest rate risk, profitability and risk weighted assets modules in its stress testing toolkit in 2021.

(b) Surveys and Data Collection

Systemic Risk Survey (SRS): MSD continued to conduct the SRS on a biannual basis since 2017. SRS is a forward-looking survey which quantifies and tracks market participants’ perceptions on the potential risks to financial system stability signalling any build up of systemic vulnerabilities. The SRS covers perceptions of risk officers of financial institutions, such as licensed banks, licensed finance companies, specialised

leasing companies, insurance companies, unit trusts managing companies, stock brokering companies and rating agencies. Materialisation of these risks could potentially disrupt the financial intermediation process, including the orderly functioning of the financial institutions, financial markets and the payments system, while affecting public confidence in financial system stability as well. The survey results provide early warning signals to foresee systemic risks to the financial system and facilitates the prioritisation of actions to be taken to mitigate emerging risks and the formulation of appropriate policy measures. Further, SRS helps to validate the internal assessments of MSD on vulnerabilities of the financial system.

Household Sector Creditworthiness Survey (HHCS): The HHCS was initiated with the purpose of enhancing household sector surveillance. MSD initiated the tender procedure to outsource the data collection of survey to a third party to expand the coverage of the HHCS and identify risks and vulnerabilities emanating from the household sector and its implications on financial system stability. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the survey had to be postponed to 2021.

Data Collection: With the view of enriching the database, MSD continued to gather granular level data from several external parties. The department continued to collect data regularly from external institutions, such as the Colombo Stock Exchange, Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka, Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka, Department of Co-operative Development, Department of Labour, Department of Pensions, Employees’ Trust Fund Board, SANASA Federation, Credit Information Bureau, Sri Lanka Customs and the Unit Trust Association of Sri Lanka. Further, in 2020 MSD started to collect data directly from licensed banks for dynamic stress testing and network analysis under SLFRS 9.

(c) Publishing the Financial System Stability Review and Contributing to Statutory Reports and Other Publications of the Central Bank

The Financial System Stability Review (FSSR) 2020: To present an independent evaluation of risks and vulnerabilities faced by the Sri Lankan financial sector and to present risk mitigation measures adopted, MSD continued to publish the FSSR annually. The FSSR 2020 consisted of five chapters namely, Macro financial Conditions; Financial Markets; Financial Institutions; Household Sector and Corporate Sector; and Financial System Infrastructure. In addition, the report contained a policy box which set out the key policy changes and regulatory actions implemented in relation to the financial sector in 2020, and three informative box articles on the Financial Stress Index for Sri Lanka, Systemic Risk Survey 2020 and Strengthening the Macroprudential Framework of Sri Lanka.

Other Publications: In view of providing a comprehensive analysis on the financial institutions, financial markets and financial infrastructure of the country with particular emphasis on performance, risks and risk management, resource availability and regulatory developments pertaining to each area, together with an assessment of potential implications on the overall financial system stability of the country, MSD continued to contribute to the key publications of the Central Bank. Accordingly, MSD coordinated and compiled the chapters on “Financial Sector Developments and Stability” of the Central Bank Annual Report 2019 and the “Recent Economic Developments 2020”, both published by the Central Bank. Further, in terms of the September 15th Report, which is submitted to the Minister in charge of Finance, MSD contributed to the chapter on Financial Sector Developments. In addition, MSD also contributed to other publications of the Central Bank by way of compiling financial sector data and providing analyses on subsectors of the financial system.

(d) Coordination of the Committees on Financial System Stability

Financial System Stability Committee (FSSC): The FSSC, which is an interdepartmental forum in the Central Bank, was established for the identification of risks affecting the financial sector, discussion of measures to mitigate risks, and the co-ordination of efforts to promote financial system stability. MSD serves as the secretariat for the FSSC. Seven FSSC meetings, including two mini FSSC meetings for specific matters, were held during 2020. MSD presented its Risk Assessment reports to the FSSC to obtain the views of the participants before submitting them to the Monetary Board.

Financial System Stability Consultative Committee (FSSCC): MSD provides secretarial services to the FSSCC. The FSSCC is expected to provide policy suggestions to the Central Bank for maintaining financial system stability. It consists of personnel from key institutions of the Sri Lankan financial system. These personnel are appointed by the Governor and the current FSSCC comprises eight members. Six FSSCC meetings were held during the year.

(e) Coordination with International Agencies

MSD, as the coordinating department of the Financial System Stability cluster, engaged with the IMF in responding to the Macroprudential Survey. At the same time, MSD coordinated with the IMF in seeking technical assistance for other departments within the financial system stability cluster. Further, as a member of the steering committee on implementing the Sustainable Finance Road Map, MSD coordinated the initiatives on developing the Sustainable Finance Taxonomy with the

International Finance Corporation (IFC), World Bank Sustainable Banking Network, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

20. PAYMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS

Payments and Settlements Department (PSD) discharged the responsibilities entrusted to the Central Bank under Section 62A of the Monetary Law Act, No. 58 of 1949 (MLA), which provides authority for the Central Bank to establish and operate systems for transfer of funds, settle payment obligations, and issue system rules to participating institutions. In addition, the statutory mandate entrusted to the Central Bank under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, No. 28 of 2005 to regulate and oversee the payment and settlement systems and to implement the national payment system policy with the objective of ensuring safety, efficiency, competitiveness and stability of the payment and settlement systems in Sri Lanka, is also carried out through PSD.

During the year 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic situation in the country, continuous operations of the department were carried out to ensure the provision of payment and settlement facilities to the general public while facilitating timely settlement of transactions to ensure maintenance of the financial system stability. Main functions carried out by PSD are operations of the Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS), providing back-office service for financial transactions, management of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) Communication System, facilitating transactions under the Asian Clearing Union (ACU), facilitating the development of payment infrastructure, and regulation and oversight of Payment and Settlement Systems (PSS). A summary of the functions performed during 2020 is given below.

20.1 Operations of the Real Time Gross Settlement System

(a) PSD continued to operate the RTGS system, which settles time-critical large value inter-participant payments as well as customer payments on a real time gross basis and to ensure smooth functioning of the RTGS System, PSD facilitated and monitored the provisioning of the Intraday Liquidity Facility (ILF) to the Participating Institutions (PIs). PIs of the RTGS System are the Central Bank, Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs), standalone Primary Dealers (PDs), Employees’ Provident Fund and the Central Depository System of the Colombo Stock Exchange.

(b) As at end 2020, the number of PIs of the RTGS System was 34.

PSD uses SWIFT services for its communication of financial operations, and manages the SWIFT system on behalf of all users of the Central Bank. PSD maintains the system in accordance with the standards set by the SWIFT Network on software, hardware, processes, procedures and risk management controls. To maintain a robust connectivity (both globally and locally) and provide an efficient and secure financial messaging service, the Central Bank has obtained the connectivity to SWIFT-Net, via Lanka Financial Services Bureau Ltd.

The SWIFT System in the Central Bank was upgraded to version 7.5.20 during 2020 and continued with quarterly security updates in 2020. The new mandatory update was carried out to provide a highly secure and more efficient

service for SWIFT users. Further, quarterly security updates were carried out to strengthen the SWIFT interface, tools and software in light of evolving cyber threats. Accordingly, the Central Bank successfully installed all upgraded versions in line with the international standards for the facilities provided by the SWIFT service. The Central Bank maintained a high level of security at the SWIFT division of PSD throughout the year. Further, the SWIFT System ensured 100 per cent of its global and domestic operations uninterruptedly during 2020.

20.4 Facilitating Transactions under the Asian Clearing Union (ACU)

activities were carried out throughout the year. In March 2020, PSD launched the digital campaign with the concept of “Cash Wade”. In addition, advertisements were published in electronic media and posters, banners and other materials were distributed to all stakeholders to educate their staff and customers on the usage of digital payment mechanisms.

(e) Introduced a reduced fee structure for cash withdrawals carried out using payment cards issued under the National Card Scheme through the Common ATM Switch (CAS). Accordingly, General Direction No. 1 of 2020 on fees chargeable on the transactions effected through the Common ATM Switch was issued to specify maximum fees that can be charged for ATM transactions carried out using payment cards issued under the National Card Scheme.

(f) JustPay, a Mobile Application based payment solution for low value payments in which the transactions are cleared through the Common Electronic Fund Transfer Switch (CEFTS), operated by LankaClear (Pvt) Ltd. (LCPL), facilitated payments up to Rs. 10,000. In April 2020, the maximum per transaction value of JustPay was increased to Rs. 25,000.

(g) Granted approval to several Government and private institutions to join the LankaPay Online Payment Platform (LPOPP) which facilitates online real time payments. In June 2020, the maximum per transaction value limit of LPOPP was set at Rs. 250 million for other institutions except for Sri Lanka Customs and the Inland Revenue Department.

(h) Liability Manager (LM) limits in CAS and CEFTS were reviewed considering the increased transaction volumes and revised the LM limits in CEFTS and the categorisation of primary members for the purpose of imposing LM limits. Accordingly, Payment and Settlement Systems Circular No. 19 of 2020 was issued to communicate the revised LM limits.

(i) Evaluated applications submitted by financial institutions and issued licences to two financial institutions enabling them to issue debit cards as service providers of payment cards, in terms of the provisions of the Payment Cards and Mobile Payment Systems Regulations No.1 of 2013. In addition, one financial institution, which was functioning as an issuer of payment cards as a licensed service provider of payment cards was granted a licence to function as a financial acquirer of payment cards.

(j) Several actions were taken during the COVID–19 pandemic to facilitate payment needs of the country. Temporary maximum transaction value limit enhancements were granted to mobile phone based e-money systems during this period. Approval was granted to open wallet or wallet facilitation accounts by conducting KYC verification

digitally subject to physical verification of KYC details within the approved time period. In addition, temporary approval was granted for cash delivery products to be operated at the request of customers.

(l) Evaluated the Business Continuity Plans of the LankaSettle participants and LCPL, in order to ensure their ability to continue business operations in a contingency situation.

20.6 National Payment Council

The National Payment Council (NPC), which is the industry consultative and monitoring committee on payment systems, monitored the progress of implementing the Road Map for 2020-2022 and the progress of committees appointed to focus on new technologies and concepts, such as digital payment platform, open application programming interface, open banking and promoting digitalisation of payments to enhance financial inclusion. A policy decision was taken to minimise customer charges to reduce the cost of transactions and accordingly, maximum per transaction fees that can be charged from customers for effecting transactions through several payment mechanisms were reduced.

Further, as per a decision taken by the NPC, the Central Bank designated the year 2020 as the year of digital transactions with the objectives of popularising digital payment schemes, educating the general public on digital payments, building a society that uses less cash, and uplifting the economy. Accordingly, PSD conducted several programmes to increase awareness and to promote the use of digital payment modes to effect payments throughout the year 2020.

20.7 Public Awareness

PSD continued to publish the quarterly “Payments Bulletin” on the Central Bank website for dissemination of information and statistics on payment and settlement systems operating in the country. In addition, PSD conducted awareness programmes on a need basis to educate the general public and the banking community on payment systems and other related issues. Further, several press releases were issued to enhance customer awareness on new technologies, payment mechanisms and related issues.

21. POLICY REVIEW AND MONITORING

Policy Review and Monitoring Department (PRMD) facilitates the strategic planning process of the Central Bank, aligning departmental functions towards achieving its core objectives. Accordingly, PRMD facilitates the formulation of strategic priorities for the Central Bank and Departmental Action Plans for the forthcoming year, and reviews the progress made in implementing such plans. In this regard,

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 114

Part II

PRMD conducts the annual Strategic Planning Retreat (SPR), meetings with Task Forces under each strategic priority and periodic reviews on Departmental Action Plans with each department.

An independent assessment on the progress made in achieving the strategic priorities and the planned activities is reported to the Corporate Management Committee (CMC) for its review and subsequently to the Monetary Board for required guidance. PRMD also compiles the Strategic and Action Plan of the Central Bank and publishes the same for the information of the Central Bank staff.

21.1 Action Plan 2020 and Strategic Priorities 2018 - 2021

Action Plan 2020 of the Central Bank, which included annual targets for 2020 with respect to Bank-wide strategic priorities and key operations/functions of the departments for the year, was launched at the New Year Work Commencement Ceremony held on 01 January 2020. In view of enhancing the effectiveness and successful implementation of Departmental Action Plans 2020, awareness sessions were conducted at departmental level within the first week of the year for the entire staff of the Central Bank.

There were seven Bank-wide strategic priorities identified to be implemented during 2018-2021, as follows:

(i) Introduction of an effective Flexible Inflation Targeting Framework

(ii) Promoting a dynamic and resilient financial sector to support sustainable growth

(iii) Modernisation of infrastructure for payments and settlements systems: paving the path towards a less-cash society

(iv) Improving prudent debt management endeavoring debt sustainability

(v) Formulation and implementation of a comprehensive HR strategy

(vi) Implementing an Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) Framework and strengthening compliance

(vii) Introduction of an International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS)

21.2 Progress Monitoring and Review

In order to assess the progress of implementation of the Bank-wide strategic priorities, the Task Force meetings, chaired by Senior Deputy Governor/respective Deputy Governor for each strategic priority, were conducted with the participation of the Assistant Governor (AG) in-charge of the respective departments and the representatives of lead and other responsible departments. The Task Force deliberated on the issues encountered and pending actions and recommended the way forward, identifying the parties responsible and planned timelines for the completion of required actions under each strategic priority.

PRMD conducted Quarterly Review meetings to assess the progress of implementation of Departmental Action Plans with the participation of the AG in-charge of the respective department and the AG in-charge of PRMD. Progress in the Departmental Action Plans was discussed in terms of the level of achievement made in the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) as per the planned timeline.

The outcome of the periodic reviews along with observations of PRMD was reported to the CMC and to the Monetary Board.

21.3 Introduction of a Categorisation Method for Key Performance Indicators

In streamlining the Departmental Action Plan preparation and progress update, a new categorisation for KPIs was introduced by PRMD to the progress review process during 2020. Accordingly, KPIs included in each Departmental Action Plan 2020 were grouped under the categories ‘Strategic’, ‘Mission critical’, ‘Process improvement’, ‘Critical operations & functions’, and ‘Other’. This categorisation helps for clear identification of the activities and functions of the Central Bank required to be performed to achieve its core objectives, and could be used for effective allocation of resources and monitoring progress.

21.4 Facilitation of Achievement of Sustainable Development Goals Applicable to the Central Bank

PRMD took measures to facilitate the introduction and prioritisation of activities related to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are applicable to the Central Bank, in the Departmental Action Plans 2021. SDGs adopted by United Nations member countries cover areas, such as economic growth, improving health and education, reduction of poverty and inequality, and preservation of the environment. The National SDG Portal will be updated with the data relevant to the Central Bank and the progress made in achieving the planned SDGs.

22. PUBLIC DEBT

Public Debt Department (PDD) is accountable for discharging statutory responsibilities of the Central Bank, as the agent of the Government for the management of public debt in terms of Section 113 of the Monetary Law Act (MLA) No. 58 of 1949. In order to ensure these responsibilities, PDD was established on 28 August 1950, at the inception of the Central Bank. The strategic priority of PDD is to improve prudent debt management endeavouring debt sustainability.

Accordingly, the key objectives of the PDD include, but are not limited to;

i. formulation, implementation and advice of a sound debt management strategy to improve the debt profile of the government;

Part II - 115

ii. ensuring that the Government’s financing needs are met at the lowest possible cost at a prudent level of risk; and

iii. developing the government securities market, deepening and broadening the secondary market for government securities, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of primary auction participation for government securities while adhering to the best standards of practices in transparency of the government securities market.

In achieving these objectives, the principal functions of PDD include;

i. raising funds in line with the gross borrowing requirement of the Government as per the Appropriation Act or other relevant legislation/authorisations from issuance of debt securities both domestically and in the international capital market;ii. accessing the international capital market through issuances of securities based on conducive market conditions and in concurrence with the Ministry of Finance (MOF). However, in 2020, Sri Lanka did not access the international capital market to issue International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) as the market conditions remained hostile.iii. maintaining the unblemished debt service payment record of the Government by servicing debt accurately and on time; iv. maintaining the LankaSecure system in order to facilitate smooth functioning of the settlement of market transactions in government securities;v. maintaining the title registry of government securities in the Central Depository System (CDS); and vi. undertaking analytics on debt dynamics for risk management of the central Government debt portfolio.

22.1 Raising of Funds to Meet the Government’s Gross Borrowing Requirement as Specified in the Appropriation Act or other Relevant Legislation/ Authorisations

(a) Issuances of Treasury bills (T-bills), Treasury bonds (T-bonds) and Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) were the main debt instruments used for financing the Government’s gross borrowing requirement in 2020.

(b) An abridged table of activities under each of the sources of funds is given below.

(c) Issuance dynamics in line with resource availability and a conducive policy environment enabled a cost saving of Rs. 283.1 billion through issuances of T-bills and T-bonds spread across the duration of issuances in 2020 compared to the average cost of issuances in 2019.

22.2 Servicing of Government Debt

Domestic currency debt service payments of Rs. 2,687.15 billion, which includes maturity payments of T-bills and foreign currency debt service payments of Rs. 1,102.03 billion, totalling Rs. 3,789.16 billion were facilitated during the year 2020 in a timely and effective manner.

The number of International Securities Identification Numbers (ISINs) serviced in domestic currency amounted to 215 for coupon and maturity payments, whereas the number of foreign loans serviced in 2020 amounted to 1894.

22.3 Facilitation of the Settlement of Government Securities

The LankaSecure system is used for the settlement of primary and secondary market transactions in government securities. The system consists of 31 Dealer Direct Participants (24 licensed commercial banks and 7 primary dealer companies) maintaining accounts on their own behalf and on behalf of other investors who will be their customers and 3 direct participants (Colombo Stock Exchange, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and Employees’ Provident Fund), who hold accounts on their own behalf only. PDD plays a main role in facilitating settlement by ensuring uninterrupted real-time operation of LankaSecure. The total face value of holdings in scripless securities as at end December 2020 amounted to Rs. 7,340.9 billion. This consisted of Rs. 1,621.4 billion in T-bills and Rs. 5,719.5 billion in T-bonds.

22.4 Maintenance of the Registry in Government Securities

Facility for real-time updates in the Title Registry of government securities in the Central Depository System (CDS), which is maintained at PDD, has ensured safekeeping

of government securities. As at end December 2020, there were 94,242 registered CDS account holders.

Periodic statements to CDS account holders on their holdings, transactions and payments were sent continuously throughout the year. PDD sent 1,278 statements in electronic form, and 12,755 semi-annual statements of holdings, 32,713 monthly statements of transactions and 14,109 payment statements by post to CDS account holders during 2020.

The real-time notification facility of LankaSecure, which was introduced in 2019, delivers a real-time notification for each and every debit and credit record of scripless securities in the LankaSecure System, carried out for each Securities Account by way of an SMS and/or e-mail alert to the customers registered and opted for the facility in the CDS. During the year 2020, LankaSecure sent 129,941 e-mails and 40,063 SMS alerts as real-time notifications. This facility was introduced to further enhance the safety and security features of customer securities accounts and to keep beneficiary accounts holders aware of securities movements in their accounts.

In addition, CDS account holders are provided with the facility to view account details online, among other facilities introduced to enhance the safety features of government securities investments.

22.5 Debt Management Initiatives and Market Developments

In order to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness and transparency with the purpose of developing the government securities market, the following initiatives were undertaken during the year 2020.

(a) Prudent Debt Management Strategy

The strategic and prudent debt management initiatives by the Central Bank in tandem with the MOF resulted in an improvement in foreign currency Average Time to Maturity (ATM), while significantly lowering the foreign currency debt exposure during 2020 despite the challenging circumstances. The debt maturing within one year increased marginally, having to rely more on T- bills during the pandemic period to facilitate the increased cashflow requirement of the Government to ensure smooth functioning of the critical government services during the pandemic.

In executing its responsibilities as the agent of the Government for managing public debt, PDD took necessary actions to keep the relevant Government and policy authorities informed about the mounting challenges in meeting debt service payments, particularly the foreign currency debt service payments in the medium term, given the unfavourable international capital market access conditions in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, less liquidity for securities issued by developing market economies, rating downgrades and elevated secondary market yield levels of Government of Sri Lanka International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs).

(b) Inclusion of Settlement Value, Price and Interest Rate of Secondary Market Transactions in Government Securities

To enhance the transparency in conducting government securities transactions in the secondary market, settlement value, price and interest rate of each and every Securities transaction is captured in the LankaSecure System, with effect from 01 January 2020.

(c) Enhancing the Predictability and Transparency of the Primary Auction Process

The scope of the quarterly rolling auction calendar was further extended to cover a period of four months during 2020, where advanced T-bond and T-bill auction calendars covering the period from January to April and September to December 2020 were published with the concurrence of the MOF in view of further enhancing the predictability and transparency of the primary auction process of government securities.1

(d) Publication of Maximum Yield Rate of Acceptance at the T-bills and T-bond auctions

PDD with the concurrence of the Monetary Board, as per the policy direction of the Government and having obtained the approval of the MOF, introduced the maximum yield rate for acceptance for all maturities offered at T-bill and T-bond auctions since 06 May 2020. This initiative was introduced as part of the Government’s policy to maintain a low interest rate environment to stimulate the economic growth and to minimise the Government’s borrowing cost during the pandemic period.

(e) Capital Market Infrastructure Development Project

The Central Bank contracted to obtain consultancy services for the Capital Market Infrastructure Development Project from BTA Consulting Limited of United Kingdom in August 2020. The selected consultant would guide through the proposed implementation of a state-of-the-art Electronic Trading Platform (ETP), Central Counterparty (CCP) settlement system and an upgraded Central Securities Depository (CSD). In addition, required legal reforms are also to be identified and implemented to facilitate the smooth functioning of new systems.

22.6 Coordinating Sovereign Rating Review Missions

In 2020, PDD facilitated international rating agencies (Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Services, S & P Global Ratings) for their annual rating reviews in order to ensure availability of international sovereign ratings for Sri Lanka. Further, the rating announcements were critically reviewed in collaboration with related departments within the Central Bank and the MOF, and periodic public announcements were made.

1 With the dissolution of the Parliament of Sri Lanka on 02 March 2020, the advanced T-bond and T-bill auction calendars were not issued until September 2020.

22.7 Way Forward

(a) Effectively strategise access to the international capital market to finance required foreign currency resources to meet debt service obligations and to gradually reduce the relative share of external debt within the overall debt profile in the medium-term. Given the highly restrictive international capital market access for both conventional and non-conventional fund raising initiatives, an immediate priority is to manage the foreign exchange outflow, accumulating non-debt creating inflows, efforts to strengthen official credit inflows for programme and project loans and liquidity facilitation arrangements as proposed and collaborated until such time market conditions return to normalcy.

(b) Introduce a new primary issuance system for T-bills and improve the existing T-bond issuance system to further enhance the efficiency of Government borrowings from the domestic market. Further, the introduction of an arrangement to open an issuance window for SLDBs in the event of an under allocation at an SLDB auction, and to expand the investment possibilities among prospective investors.

(c) Further facilitation of an issuance window for T-bills and T-bonds for investments upon regular issuance cycles for smoothening future issuance cycles, is also being reviewed.

(d) With a view of enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the data recorded in the LankaSecure system on government securities transactions, a guideline was issued to all participants of the LankaSettle System on 09 December 2020 on recording of secondary market transaction data and sending securities settlement instructions to the Scripless Securities Settlement System (SSSS) to reinforce the current transaction recording requirements and to improve transaction recording practices in the secondary market with effect from 01 January 2021.

23. REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT

The year 2020 was a challenging year for Regional Development Department (RDD) since it had to be proactively involved in implementing several initiatives of the Government and the Central Bank during the COVID-19 pandemic to support individuals and businesses and review economic activity while carrying out its routine operations. As a result, several unprecedented policy measures were taken to support Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) including self-employed individuals of all economic sectors, to rescue them from the negative economic impact of the pandemic. In this regard, six Regional Offices of the Central Bank also played a predominant role in addition to representing the Central Bank at the regional level.

The conventional concessionary loan schemes operated by RDD were continued successfully in spite of the unforeseen circumstances which presented many uncompromising challenges. Thus, the coordination, facilitation and implementation of refinance, interest subsidy and credit guarantee schemes funded by the Government, the Central Bank, Donor Agencies and Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) continued amidst the pandemic.

In 2020, several new loan schemes were implemented by the RDD. Three of them i.e. Phase I, Phase II and Phase III of the Saubagya COVID-19 Renaissance Facility (SCRF) solely focused on the economic recovery of the MSMEs affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, RDD implemented the Supply Chain Re-Energising Loan Scheme (SCRELS) for the tea sector while introducing the operations of Smallholder Tea and Rubber Revitalisation (STaRR) Interest Subsidy Scheme and Credit Guarantee Scheme for working capital loans for Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) with loans currently in the Non-Performing Loans (NPL) category.

Furthermore, RDD took measures to restructure the existing loan schemes. Accordingly, the credit component of the Smallholder Agribusiness Partnerships Programme (SAPP) was increased while reducing the interest rates of the New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS). In addition, the interest rate of the Saubagya Loan Scheme, the flagship loan scheme of the RDD, was reduced to support MSMEs to continue their businesses in the critical time period faced during the year 2020, while introducing home-gardening with the intention of improving access to finance for the underprivileged and vulnerable sectors of the economy.

In the year 2020, RDD used electronic media vigorously to increase public awareness on the actions taken to counter the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, many MSMEs, who were affected by the pandemic, benefited and obtained credit and other concessions through the financial sector.

23.1 Providing Concessionary Financial Facilities

In 2020, 14 refinances, interest subsidy and credit guarantee schemes, funded by the Government, the Central Bank and Donor Agencies, were implemented by RDD. Summary information on these schemes are given in Table II - 31.

Overall, RDD supported 130,642 beneficiaries by releasing Rs. 185,055.29 million through PFIs in 2020 under 10 refinance and 4 interest subsidy and/or credit guarantee schemes. Out of total loans granted, 65.1 per cent were granted through the refinance schemes while the balance 34.9 per cent was released through interest subsidy and/or credit guarantee schemes. With respect to the funding source, the Central Bank funded 95.4 per cent of the total loan amount, reflecting the commitment of the Central Bank to overcome the negative economic impact of COVID-19. The share of loans disbursed by RDD during 2020 using

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 118

Part II

funds from the Government and donors accounted for 4.4 per cent and 0.2 per cent, respectively. However, it was observed that the significantly lower performance of the donor funded projects can be attributed to the strict social distancing measures that prevailed in the country in 2020, which prevented in-person value chain development activities.

Detailed information on the credit schemes implemented by RDD in 2020, including new developments with regard to these loan schemes, are given below.

23.1.1 Implementation of Government Funded Schemes

RDD, as an agent of the Government, implemented 7 Government funded schemes consisting of 5 refinance schemes and 2 interest subsidy and credit guarantee schemes by contributing Rs. 8,190.66 million i.e., 4.4 per cent of the total loan disbursements during 2020 serving 67,110 beneficiaries.

(a) Government Funded Interest Subsidy and Credit Guarantee Schemes

During the year, “Sarusara” i.e. NCRCS, a Government funded interest subsidy scheme and a credit guarantee scheme, catered 62,439 farmers to meet their short term working capital requirements for cultivating 33 short term crop varieties. In 2020, loans worth of Rs. 7,441.45 million disbursed by the PFIs under the NCRCS accounted for 90.49 per cent of the disbursements of the Government funded schemes. Of this amount, a sum of Rs. 4,990.1 million was disbursed among 40,666 farmers during the 2019/2020 Maha season while the balance Rs. 2,451.31 million was disbursed among 21,773 farmers during the 2020 Yala season. During the year, the Government provided Rs. 162.86 million worth of interest subsidy under the NCRCS. In the policy front, the interest rate to the end borrower of the NCRCS was reduced from 7.0 per cent per annum to 4.0 per cent per annum considering the unconducive economic environment in the country. Further, with the view of encouraging domestic agriculture, arrangements were made to include Home Gardening under the NCRCS with a maximum loan amount of Rs. 40,000 per borrower.

Operations of the STaRR interest subsidy scheme commenced during 2020 with the involvement of the Ministry of Plantation Industries and Export Agriculture (MPIEA). While the STaRR Project is funded by the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD), the STaRR Interest Subsidy Scheme is funded by the Government. The STaRR Project is intended to support tea and rubber smallholder farmers to establish self-employment or short term income generating activities, until such time the production is generated from their new plantations.

A new credit guarantee scheme, designed for granting credit guarantees for the Working Capital Loans (WCLs) for SMEs whose previous loans are currently in the NPL category, was implemented in 2020. The Central Bank, on behalf of the Government, provides a credit guarantee covering up to 75.0 per cent of the WCLs for the existing borrowers who are currently in the NPL category. PFIs are required to pay a guarantee premium of 1.0 per cent per annum for the repayment period of the WCLs from the value of the guaranteed amount of the WCLs to claim the credit guarantee under the scheme.

(b) Government Funded Refinance Schemes

In 2020, RDD implemented 5 refinance loan schemes, namely, the Poverty Alleviation Microfinance Project – Revolving Fund (PAMP-RF), Self-Employment Promotion Initiative Loan Scheme - Phase II (SEPI – Phase II), Swashakthi Loan Scheme, SCRELS, and Revolving Fund (RF) Income Generation Loan Scheme under the Government funded component of the SAPP.

Out of these schemes, SCRELS was introduced in 2020 with Rs.500 million allocated by the Tea Promotion and Marketing Fund of the Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB) with the primary objective of aiding Registered Tea Manufacturers (RTM) who have already been identified by the SLTB to provide working capital loans to restart their businesses. The scheme was jointly designed by the Central Bank, the Ministry of Plantation Industries and Export Agriculture (MPI&EA) and the SLTB. A maximum loan amount of Rs.3 million will be granted per RTM under this scheme for a maximum loan tenure of 2 years to revamp existing businesses, to conclude debt restructuring plans, to work out new business plans and modernisation strategies for each tea factory, and to settle the existing payment arrears to suppliers to re-energise the supply chain.

Further, with the newly introduced changes to the credit component of SAPP, the RF component of the SAPP funded by the Government was expanded to seven loan schemes (RF Agribusiness Loan Scheme, RF Youth Loan Scheme, RF Income Generation Loan Scheme, RF Promoter Loan Scheme, RF Promoter Bulk Loan Scheme, RF Financial Intermediary (FI) Bulk Loan Scheme, and RF Tea and Rubber Sector Loan Scheme) in late 2020. These new schemes will be implemented from the beginning of 2021.

23.1.2 Implementation of the Central Bank Funded Schemes

In 2020, the Central Bank funded schemes played a predominant role in supporting MSMEs and individuals whose economic activities were affected during the COVID-19 pandemic by disbursing 94.0 per cent of the total loans disbursed through the loan schemes implemented by RDD.

The “Saubagya COVID-19 Renaissance Facility (SCRF)” was established by RDD, initially to operate as a separate

Part II - 119

refinance component of the Saubagya Loan Scheme, the flagship refinance scheme funded by the Central Bank. Later, SCRF was implemented in another 2 phases. The SCRF Phase I was established in terms of Section 88 of the Monetary Law Act (MLA) No. 58 of 1949 through both Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) and Licensed Specialised Banks (LSBs) as PFIs to disburse loans. The SCRF Phase I provided refinancing at a concessionary interest rate of 1.0 per cent per annum to PFIs to release loans to affected businesses at a concessionary interest rate of 4.0 per cent per annum to cover short term working capital requirements subject to a maximum of Rs. 25 million, i.e. two months’ working capital of affected business to be paid in 24 months including a 6 month grace period.

The SCRF Phase II, a financing facility provided in terms of Section 83 of the MLA was implemented with the same conditions of Phase I for the affected businesses only through LCBs. For the funding arrangements, LCBs are required to pledge the collaterals with the Central Bank.

The third phase of the COVID-19 renaissance effort was implemented as a Credit Guarantee and Interest Subsidy Scheme under the provisions of Section 108 of the MLA, to encourage PFIs to lend to the affected MSMEs utilising own funds of the PFIs.

The performance of the SCRF Phase I, II and III is given below;

23.1.3 Implementation of Donor Funded Schemes

In 2020, RDD continued to implement the donor funded component of the Smallholder Agribusiness Partnerships Programme (SAPP) funded by IFAD, in collaboration with the Project Management Unit of SAPP. This component included Public-Private-Producer-Partnership (4P) Agribusiness and 4P Youth Loan Schemes. These schemes released Rs. 336.03 million among 1,517 beneficiaries during 2020.

The SAPP acts as an agriculture value chain financing programme mainly focusing on improving access to finance among farmers, farmer groups and youth entrepreneurs who participated in the agricultural value chains, from its inception.

Considering the importance of addressing many issues in the sectors, a major restructuring process was implemented to allow, the Promoters officially partnered with 4P arrangements of SAPP and the Community based Financial Intermediaries (FI), such as Co-operative Rural Banks registered under the Department of Co-operative

Development, Agrarian Banks (Govijana Banks) registered under the Department of Agrarian Development, Samurdhi Banks registered under the Department of Samurdhi Development and Sanasa Societies registered under the Federation of Thrift and Credit Co-operative Societies in Sri Lanka, to obtain loans under the SAPP.

The new credit component of the SAPP includes five 4P loan schemes (4P Agribusiness Loan Scheme, 4P Youth Loan Scheme, 4P Promoter Loan Scheme, 4P Promoter Bulk Loan Scheme and 4P Financial Intermediary Bulk Loan Scheme) instead of the previous five 4P loan schemes operated under the SAPP.

23.2. Amalgamating Operations of the Regional Offices (ROO) of the Central Bank

The Central Bank has established Regional Offices from time to time from 1981 to address issues in the lagging regions and to provide certain services of the Central Bank to the community in remote areas. At present, there are six Regional offices operating in Matara, Anuradhapura, Matale, Kilinochchi, Trincomalee and Nuwaraeliya. With a view to strengthening the activities of Regional Offices in line with the financial inclusion objectives of the Central Bank, Regional Offices were amalgamated with RDD in July 2020.

23.2.1 Webinars as a Knowledge Dissemination Tool

In spite of the difficulties created by the COVID-19 pandemic, RDD and the Regional Offices conducted awareness programmes on formal and affordable financial services, financial literacy, entrepreneurship and skill development for the benefit of entrepreneurs, government officials, students and general public island-wide. Since COVID-19 pandemic related health guidelines restricted in-person gatherings, Regional Offices that are operated under RDD commenced conducting webinars instead of in-person programmes to continue financial literacy dissemination. Accordingly, nearly 115,000 participants benefited from the online programmes in 2020.

23.2.2 Regional Level Representation

Regional Offices facilitated conducting various programmes coordinated by other departments in the respective regions while helping needy pockets in the remote and lagging regions by conducting awareness sessions, credit camps, trade fairs, etc. Apart from the above, Regional Offices directly handled more than 64,000 Employees’ Provident Fund related queries and activities during the year.

23.3 Other Initiatives of RDD

23.3.1 The National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) in Sri Lanka

In 2020, all the resources of RDD were mainly allocated to support the economic recovery efforts in line with government directions. This skewed resource allocation, coupled with the negative social environment that prevailed in the country, hindered most of the planned activities of the NFIS during

Part II

2020. Thus, the national launch of the NFIS and the Financial Literacy Survey for Sri Lanka planned to be completed in 2020 were postponed to the first quarter of 2021.

Nonetheless, with the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers in March 2020 for the implementation of the proposed actions of the NFIS, a national-level coordination mechanism was established by conducting the first ever management committee meeting of the NFIS in late 2020 and the National Financial Inclusion Council meeting in January 2021. Further, arrangements are being made to establish

the NFIS Secretariat which is expected to coordinate the financial inclusion efforts in the country.

23.3.2 CBSL-AFI Virtual Member Training on Implementation and Monitoring of the NFIS

Since it was impossible to conduct in-person international training programmes due to the pandemic, RDD, jointly with the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI), conducted the “CBSL-AFI Virtual Member Training on Implementation and Monitoring of National Financial Inclusion Strategy” from 6th to 8th July 2020.

23.4 Financial Literacy

During the first quarter of 2020, RDD and Regional Offices of the Central Bank conducted awareness programmes and workshops to promote financial literacy and financial inclusiveness, targeting those who have been excluded from the formal financial sector. However, the situation that prevailed in the country hindered the conducting of the awareness programmes during the second half of the year. 356 programmes on financial literacy, entrepreneurship development and skill development and MSME issues were conducted during 2020 of which 168 programmes were directly conducted by the Regional Offices of the Central Bank. Further, RDD conducted 17 other programmes including 3 Training of Trainers (TOT) programmes in 2020 (Table II - 32).

24. Resolution and Enforcement

Resolution and Enforcement Department (RED) was established on 01 January 2018 by amalgamating the Enforcement Unit and the Deposit Insurance Unit, which operated within Legal and Compliance Department (LCD) and Bank Supervision Department (BSD), respectively.

The key objectives of RED are resolving distressed financial institutions, conducting special investigations against officials of institutions who have acted in contravention of the provisions of relevant regulations and laws of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988 (BA) and the Finance Business Act No. 42 of 2011, including prohibited schemes. RED consists of five (05) divisions, namely, Resolution, Enforcement and Prosecution, Special Investigations, Deposit Insurance and Administration, to perform the following core functions assigned to the department.

24.1. Resolution of Distressed Financial Institutions

RED is in the process of developing a comprehensive resolution framework to include resolution mechanisms for all entities supervised by the Central Bank with clear legal empowerments. It will initially develop a comprehensive resolution framework to include resolution mechanisms on Licensed Banks and Licensed Finance Companies within the

existing regulatory framework with clearly defined resolution powers and resolution authority. At present, almost all resolution powers are vested with the relevant regulators i.e., Director of Bank Supervision (DBS) (in the case of licensed banks) and Director of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions (D/SNBFI) (in the case of non-bank financial institutions), as per the relevant legal enactments.

24.2. Enforcement Activities

Enforcement functions of RED are being conducted under the current operating procedures prepared including internal arrangements in terms of the prevailing legal provisions. Accordingly, in order to conduct investigations on prohibited schemes, the Governor appoints officers of RED under Section 83C of the BA.

Based on the above, two (02) new investigations were initiated by authorised officers of RED under the provisions of BA after conducting preliminary investigations of the businesses of five (05) institutions alleged to be operating prohibited schemes in contravention of the provisions of the Banking Act. Further, RED coordinated and followed up the investigations already referred to the Attorney General for prosecutions with the support of LCD.

As a preventive measure, the Enforcement Division conducts awareness programmes to educate different segments of the general public on prohibited schemes and to improve their financial literacy in coordination with other departments of the Central Bank. RED was able to conduct eleven (11) awareness programmes for students, government officers and police officers during the year under review despite the restrictions imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

24.3. Administration of the Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance and Liquidity Support Scheme (SLDILSS)

As at 31 December 2020, the Scheme comprised seventy one (71) member institutions with a total fund of approximately Rs. 51.3 billion (unaudited). As at 31 December 2020, the value of the investments in government securities and the loan granted to a member institution by the fund in 2014 under the liquidity support facility for restructuring were Rs. 67.8 billion (at fair value) and Rs. 0.7 billion (net of provisions), respectively. Financial highlights of SLDILSS are given in Table II-34.

The SLDILSS has reported a loss of Rs.11.15 billion during the year 2020 mainly due to the significant amount of compensation payments to the insured depositors of failed

Licensed Finance Companies through the Scheme during the year. The total expenditure includes compensation payments to the failed Licensed Finance Companies including, The Finance Company PLC (TFC), ETI Finance Limited (ETIFL) and Swarnamahal Financial Services PLC (SFSP) amounting to Rs.22.06 billion and provision made due to increase of amount of maximum compensation payable of the SLDILSS from Rs.600,000 to Rs.1,100,000 as per the Monetary Board decision in order to provide the benefit of increase of compensation payable amount to the insured depositors of already failed six (06) member institutions amounting to Rs.9.56 billion.

The premium applicable for licensed finance companies is 0.15 per cent per annum. Premia and penalties from member institutions during the year under review amounted to Rs. 10.4 billion.

(ii) The deposit insurance coverage per depositor per institution is increased to Rs. 1,100,000 from Rs. 600,000.

24.4. Compensation payments to the depositors of distressed finance companies

The Monetary Board granted approval to cancel the licenses issued to four (04) distressed member institutions, namely Central Investments and Finance PLC (CIFL), The Standard Credit Finance Ltd (TSCFL), TKS Finance Ltd (TKSFL) and TFC during the period from 2018 to 2020 and the suspension of the business of ETIFL and SFSP during the year 2020. Accordingly, compensation payments to the depositors of companies referred to above commenced from 2018 and continued during the year 2020 as well, in accordance with SLDILSS Regulations.

With a view to compensating the insured depositors of SLDILSS in an efficient and timely manner, an Agency Banking concept was introduced when making the compensation to the depositors of TFC, ETIFL and SFSP. Agency Banking is an internationally accepted method widely used by well-established Deposit Insurance Systems in the world. Accordingly, People’s Bank was selected as the Agent Bank of SLDILSS in making the compensation payments to the depositors of TFC, ETIFL and SFS by considering its large network of branches and adequate resources to facilitate the payments to depositors scattered islandwide. SLDILSS was able to pay compensation amounting to Rs. 21,114.9 million to 66,731 depositors of all six (06) license cancelled and suspended companies as at 31.12.2020, and such details are given in Table below.

25. RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk Management Department (RMD) sets out the policies for the implementation of risk management across the Central Bank as stipulated in the Risk Management Policy Statement (RMPS) developed in line with the risk management framework of the Central Bank. In this process, the Central Bank follows accepted standards, guidelines and best practices for managing risks, while assigning risk ownership and management among different stakeholders with clear accountability.

25.1 Operational Risk

RMD developed the Operational Risk Management (ORM) Guidelines during 2020, aligning them with RMPS, to facilitate the operational risk assessment of the Central Bank.

In order to keep the risk identification process up-to-date and to effectively manage any risk involved in operations, RMD reviewed the Operational Risk Taxonomy of the Central Bank during 2020, and incorporated amendments as required.

Continuing the facilitation provided for departmental risk assessments, RMD worked closely with departments in assisting the development of Departmental Risk Registers. The risk profile of the Central Bank is developed using Departmental Risk Registers, enhancing the operational risk management process.

With the view of promoting a risk culture within the Central Bank, RMD conducted risk awareness sessions for the Central Bank staff throughout the year. Such one-on-one departmental discussions facilitated the development of Departmental Risk Registers. However, providing any training through external professionals was not possible due to the pandemic.

RMD continued to administer incidents reported through the Incident Reporting System, enabling the development of a central repository of incidents and tracking progress on the implementation of corrective measures. The information gathered through this system helps in identifying possible risk trends, areas of vulnerabilities and improving related risk treatment measures.

In order to strengthen the operational risk management function, RMD collaborated with the World Bank Technical Assistance Mission (WBTAM). However, the expected extension to WBTAM was not possible during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

25.2 Financial Risk

As the second line of defence, RMD independently monitors, analyses, evaluates, and reports financial risks covering credit, market and liquidity risks. Further, it ensures compliance with Investment Policy Statements (IPS) and Investment Guidelines (IG) developed in line with the RMPS, relating to International Reserves (IR), Internal Investment Funds (IIF) of the Central Bank and the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), which is carried out as an agency function for the Government.

RMD reviewed the IG for IIF, incorporating amendments as required while introducing a new IG for IR during 2020. Further, RMD reviewed the Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) for IR. RMD commenced reviewing the Counterparty Credit Risk Management Guidelines (CCRMG) for IR and also intends to introduce new CCRMGs for IIF and EPF in the future. RMD assessed market and credit risks by frequent analyses of the relevant risk indicators and monitoring adherence to the limit framework given in SAAs, IPSs and IGs for IR, IIF and EPF, as well as CCRMG for IR. Risk assessments and non-compliances were presented at relevant monthly Investment Oversight Committee (IOC) meetings.

Quarterly reporting to the Non-Financial Risk Management Committee (NFRMC) on operational risks and the Board Risk Oversight Committee (BROC) and the Monetary Board on both operational and financial risks was carried out by RMD to effectively manage risks related to operations and fund management activities of the Central Bank.

26. SECRETARIAT

administration of superannuation funds, facilitating overseas studies and training, conducting the Board of Survey for assets disposal management, and providing secretarial and protocol assistance to the Governor.

(a) Overall Corporate Administration

During the year 2020, overall corporate administration was performed in line with governing regulations, accountability, risk management, and other key attributes of good governance. In doing so, SD conducted a survey on the Central Bank’s properties, and having identified the risk areas, obtained a comprehensive insurance cover for all the properties of the Central Bank, facilitated incoming and outgoing postal services of the Central Bank through its mail management service, ensured efficient and economical stationery store management, organised a variety of events for the Central Bank, and signed several agreements with service providers on behalf of the Monetary Board during the year.

(b) Procurement Management

During 2020, SD carried out the procurement of goods and services required for the bank in accordance with the procurement plan which was prepared based on the Monetary Board approved Annual Budget of the Central Bank. Procurements were done through tender procedures as well as non-tender procedures in line with the procurement procedures set out in the Central Bank Manual which are broadly consistent with National Procurement Guidelines. In addition, SD promptly attended a number of time-critical ad-hoc procurements. Further, SD contributed to the procurement of goods and services under the Financial Sector Modernisation Project of the World Bank. Considering postal delays and their impact on the tender processes due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation, with the support of the Information Technology Department (ITD), SD introduced an on-line internet mode for tender-based procurements, while ensuring adequate security measures. This enabled SD to attend to tenders timely, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic when procuring Goods and Services. In addition, SD implemented a new Stationery Management System with the assistance of ITD for facilitating effective and efficient stationery management of the Central Bank.

(c) Administration of Superannuation Funds

SD continued to administer the payments relating to the Superannuation Funds of the Central Bank which involve 2,314 beneficiaries. Accordingly, SD engaged in paying gratuities, commuted pensions, releasing provident fund balances, and making monthly pensions, Widows’ and Orphans’ Pension (W&OP) payments, and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension (WR&OP) payments. Further, SD attended to a number of correspondences with the beneficiaries in

order to fulfill their requirements and also collected life certificates on a half-yearly basis in line with Pension Rules specified in the Central Bank Manual.

(d) Facilitating overseas studies and Training

During 2020, SD facilitated postgraduate studies and short term training for employees and duty travels abroad for members of the senior management. In this regard, SD involved in making payments to universities, other training institutions and to the employees who travelled abroad for aforesaid purposes. In addition, SD issued visa letters and Provident Fund balance confirmation letters enabling obtaining visas and also facilitated purchasing air tickets and travel insurance. However, compared to previous years, the number of opportunities for such foreign travel was at a subdued level due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

(e) Conducting Board of Survey

The Board of Survey is the method employed by the Central Bank for disposal of its fixed assets. Accordingly, a survey of the assets was completed during the year. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, disposal of the assets was not undertaken.

(f) Provision of Secretarial and Protocol Assistance to the Governor

The Governor’s Secretariat provided secretarial and protocol assistance to the Governor in 2020. The secretarial and protocol assistance provided included scheduling of appointments and meetings, preparation and compilation of presentations and speeches for the Governor, coordinating and arranging the Governor’s local travels, arranging official functions hosted by the Governor and protocol services provided to VIP visitors of the Governor and the Central Bank.

27. SECURITY SERVICES

Security Services Department (SSD) continued its operations to protect the employees, visitors and properties of the Central Bank including the Regional Offices and other establishments in spite of the various challenges encountered during the year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Special security arrangements were provided for Licensed Finance Companies and their branches on an urgent basis and currency consignments in transit coordinating with the Sri Lanka Police as organisational priorities. Upgrading of CCTV system from analogue to IP based was completed and is to be commissioned with interfacing the security monitoring system with the assistance of Facilities Management Department (FMD). SSD actively contributed to all business continuity drills of the Central Bank and also conducted annual fire drills with the assistance of Fire Services Department.

System Improvements

Maintenance services of all other security equipment including baggage scanners, cargo scanners were carried out as per the service agreements with the respective service providers. SSD continuously updated itself with intelligence information and maintained relationships with relevant authorities.

Skills and Competency Building

SSD arranged several educational programmes for its staff in order to improve the skills of Security Officers. These educational programmes covered the key areas of security, information technology, ethics and customer care. SSD also initiated a new one day workshop on ‘Asset Protection’ for the Security Officers of the department, regarding the latest security procedures and technology prevailing in the world.

Surveillance activities

SSD screened and facilitated 61,715 visitors to the Head Office of the Central Bank and all visitors to its Regional Offices. 25,714 currency boxes in transit were screened throughout the year. Security controls were enhanced by installing a new CCTV system and an emergency alarm system at the Regional Office in Anuradhapura for special monitoring of currency contingency vaults operations and a CCTV system at the Regional Office in Nuwara-Eliya.

Prevention of COVID-19

SSD conducted prevention measures such as, monitoring the temperature of the staff, visitors and screened and registered all the visitors through the visitor management system before entering the premises according to the guidelines imposed by the health authorities. SSD supported documentation and mail management systems of all the departments who could not receive the services of the staff due to the pandemic. SSD authorised curfew permission letters in coordination with Sri Lanka Police and assisted to sanitise the suspected and common areas and facilitated the provision of staff restaurant services, temporary accommodations, transport and delivery services during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially during the lockdown period. Further, SSD introduced a new duty roster system for its staff to reduce human contact inside the bank premises.

Assessment of Security Controls

28. STAFF SERVICES MANAGEMENT

Amidst the challenging environment caused by COVID-19 pandemic, Staff Services Management Department (SSMD) continued to extend welfare facilities to all beneficiaries during the year 2020. The measures taken to comply with the guidelines issued by the health authorities regarding COVID-19 pandemic led to reduction in the number of staff attending office in person. However, work from home arrangements introduced by the Bank helped to perform the activities in the department. The key services rendered by the department include the provision of medical facilities and restaurant facilities to the staff within the premises of the Central Bank, disbursement of loans under the Staff Housing (Mortgage) Loan Scheme, Provident Fund Loan Scheme and Staff Benefit Scheme, and reimbursement of medical expenses under the Employer Contributory Medical Benefit Scheme (MBS).

SSMD continued to provide medical facilities to the staff through the medical center during office hours. In addition, online service of a medical officer was made available to those who sought such facilities during the COVID-19 affected period when physical movement of the staff members had to be curtailed. Medical tests and laboratory services were also provided to the members of staff at the medical center at a reasonable rate.

The disbursement of housing and other welfare loans provided to staff members as assistance for major life cycle events were continued during the year. The loan systems enabled timely disbursement of housing loan instalments and supervision and monitoring of loans.

SSMD continued to reimburse medical expenses incurred by all beneficiaries registered under the MBS during the year. The number of beneficiaries under the MBS consisting of employees, pensioners and their registered dependents together with widows/widowers stood at approximately 10,000 as at end 2020.

Restaurant facilities were provided to members of staff during working hours through an outsourced service provider. SSMD supervised the operations of the restaurant to ensure the provision of quality food and beverages to the staff at reasonable prices.

29. STATISTICS

Statistics Department (STD) contributed towards the attainment of the Central Bank’s objectives of ‘maintaining economic and price stability’ and ‘maintaining financial system stability’ by effectively engaging in its operations. Even in the midst of the restrictions on mobility and the challenging work environment, which prevailed during the year, the department was able to successfully carry out its functions as initially planned using novel technologies with minimal disturbances.

29.1 Collecting Data and Compiling Indices through Surveys and Other Data Sources

(a) Business Surveys

Despite all the obstacles that emanated from the COVID-19 pandemic, Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) Surveys for Manufacturing, Construction and Services activities were conducted during the year on a monthly frequency, to be used as real-time indicators.

Based on the findings of PMI surveys, sub-indices were compiled to assess the month-on-month developments. PMI Manufacturing consists of five sub-indices, namely, New Orders, Production, Employment, Suppliers’ Delivery Time, and Stock of Purchases, while PMI Services consists of New Businesses, Business Activity, Employment, Backlogs of Work, and Expectations for Activity sub-indices. The results were used in GDP forecasting and were reported to the management for policy decision making, while press notices were issued for the use of the general public.

The PMI Construction survey also consists of five sub-indices, i.e. New Orders, Total Activity, Employment, Quantity of Purchases, and Suppliers’ Delivery Time. The results were used in forecasting GDP and reported to the management to be considered in the policy decision making process.

The Business Outlook Survey (BOS) was continued on a quarterly basis during 2020 to capture the sentiments of the corporate sector with respect to current and expected developments of key areas of business activities, which serve to monitor the ongoing status of the economy. Especially, during 2020, the survey provided up-to-date information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and the required policy considerations.

Based on the results of the BOS, Business Sentiment Indices, namely, Business Condition, Profitability, Skilled Labour Availability, Sales, Demand, and Capacity Utilisation were compiled and used mainly in forecasting GDP. The results and detailed reports were submitted to the management for policymaking purposes. Further, major indices were published quarterly in aggregate form on the Central Bank website for the information of external users.

Credit Conditions Surveys, namely Credit Demand Survey (CDS) and Credit Supply Survey (CSS), designed to capture both demand and supply side developments of the credit activities were continued during 2020. With regard to the CDS, the target population was the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) of the economy. The survey was conducted by STD in association with the Regional Offices of the Central Bank. Further, this survey was restructured in 2020 and conducted as an annual survey, and the results were key to having an insight on

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 126

Part II

the implications for credit activities amidst the pandemic situation, in the policymaking process. The CSS, designed to capture the recent developments and forward-looking information on the credit activities, covering all licensed banks was conducted on a quarterly basis. The results facilitated technical analyses relating to the monetary policy and the financial system stability policy formulation process of the Central Bank. Further, the survey findings were published on the Central Bank website for the benefit of external users.

The Retail Sales Volume Survey (RSVS) and the Supermarket Retail Trade Survey (SRTS) were continued on a monthly and quarterly basis, respectively, to understand developments in the retail sector. Through these surveys, fluctuations in the trade volumes related to the general retail trade activities as well as trends in the modern retail trade activities were captured. To understand the developments in the transportation sector, the department initiated a monthly survey covering the key segments in transportation, such as land transportation, port and logistic services, and air transportation. The target population of this survey was major players involved in transportation related activities of the economy. The results of these surveys are currently used for internal economic analyses of the Central Bank.

The Condominium Market Survey (CMS), which was launched with the objective of obtaining data related to the developments of the condominium sector, was continued during 2020 on a quarterly basis. The survey covered major condominium developers and gathered data on actual sales prices, demand, reasons for price changes, number of existing and upcoming housing units, level of occupancy in projects, and buyer portfolio details. With the emergence of adverse conditions pertaining to the pandemic, forward-looking opinions were also gathered to understand the future direction of the sector, which would complement the policy setting process of the Central Bank. A summary report of the findings of this survey was published on the Central Bank website from the third quarter of 2020 onwards.

Based on the results of the CMS, a quarterly index was compiled for monitoring the price developments in the primary condominium market. Simultaneously, a property price index for secondary condominium market was compiled on a monthly basis, using the price information advertised on real estate websites. Subsequently this was further extended to cover lands and houses segments.

Further, STD compiled the Land Valuation Indicator (LVI) (base period: first half of 2017), on a semi-annual basis of all Divisional Secretariats of the Colombo District. The index comprised three sub-indices that were compiled covering Residential, Commercial and Industrial lands, based on per perch bare land valuations obtained from the Government Valuation

Department. Further, STD issued press releases on LVI for the information of the public.

Meanwhile, STD is continuously engaged in exercises to improve the property price indices with the technical assistance extended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in order to compile and publish a comprehensive set of indices in the future.

(b) Inflation Expectations Survey (IES)

STD continued to conduct the IES on a monthly basis to gather data and information on inflation expectations of selected categories of economic agents, i.e. the Corporate Sector and the Household Sector. During 2020, with the objective of expanding the coverage of the Household Sector further at the national level, STD conducted three pilot surveys in selected institutions of the public sector located in the vicinities of the Matara, Anuradhapura and Matale Regional Offices of the Central Bank, with the assistance of the respective Regional Offices. Awareness sessions were also conducted while carrying out these surveys to bridge the awareness gaps on inflation and inflation expectations of the Household Sector.

(c) Country Wide Data Collection System (CWDCS)

Operations of the CWDCS were continued during 2020 with the engagement of 53 Teacher Investigators (TIs) to collect retail prices of an identical basket of goods to that of the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI), producer prices of agricultural commodities and building materials, daily wages of the informal sector workers, inflation expectations, and retail sales volumes of selected categories of goods, thereby enabling the Central Bank to provide timely inputs for in-house policymaking processes. With the view of improving the quality of data collected through the CWDCS, STD conducted on-site and off-site supervision of data collection with the help of the Regional Offices of the Central Bank to identify the outliers and inconsistencies in data and to take necessary corrective measures. Further, STD conducted three virtual seminars during 2020, to discuss the issues faced by TIs during the data collection process and the remedial actions.

Moreover, the services of non-teacher data investigators were also obtained to collect data/information on wholesale and retail prices from the Pettah market, Marandagahamula rice market, Dambulla and Narahenpita Special Economic Centres, and Negombo and Peliyagoda Fish markets on a daily basis. The department collected the information from those key markets to strengthen the management information system on the price movements of essential food items and for forecasting purposes. Further, having analysed, the price data were published daily on the Central Bank website in summarised form.

Part II - 127

STD initiated monitoring the price behaviour of the items of the food basket of the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI), using prices of food items available in major supermarkets, with the objective of developing leading indicators to be used in CCPI based inflation forecasting. For this purpose, prices of all items in the food basket of the CCPI were collected from the websites of the supermarkets on a daily basis. Using these data, month-on-month price changes of each item in the food basket were derived and used as a leading indicator for CCPI based inflation forecasting.

(d) Public Sector Employment Survey and Labour Force Information

The Public Sector Employment Survey was conducted on an annual basis covering all public sector institutions (i.e. institutions under the central Government, provincial councils and local government authorities, and semi-government institutions) to ascertain the developments in public sector employment. In addition, overall labour market data analysis with respect to employment, unemployment, foreign employment, labour relations, strikes, and labour market reforms was done by STD by obtaining data/information from the Department of Census and Statistics, Department of Labour, Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment and other data providers.

Wage rate indices covering the public, formal and informal private sectors were compiled by STD to assess the movements of salaries and wages within the economy. During 2020, the nominal and real wage rate indices for the public sector were compiled based on the public administration salary circulars that were issued from time to time. With regard to the formal private sector, real wage rate indices were compiled using the nominal wage rate indices for the employees in the Wages Boards Trades provided by the Department of Labour. The informal private sector wage rate index was compiled to assess the wage movements of the sector, based on the information collected through the CWDCS. The wage rate indices were submitted monthly to the Special Data Dissemination System (SDDS).

(e) On Demand Surveys

STD, in addition to its regular surveys, undertakes numerous surveys based on the requirements that may arise spontaneously due to the occurrence of contingent events/developments that might have a significant impact on the economy and/or important areas for central banking activities. During 2020, several such surveys, particularly relating to manufacturing, construction, services and IT/BPM activities, were conducted on a needs basis to capture the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

29.2 Forecasting Short Term Inflation and GDP

STD continuously engaged in forecasting short term inflation and GDP, contributing to the Forecasting and Policy Analysis System (FPAS) of the Central Bank, while providing relevant analyses and other information to the management. Accordingly, both the model based and indicator based forecasts were produced using relevant inputs from various sources. These forecasts were detailed at regular monetary policy cycles and submitted to the Monetary Board to facilitate policy decision making.

Both the CCPI and NCPI short term inflation forecasts were based on recent price trends, expected price movements associated with market developments, and econometric techniques. The department continuously explored new variables, which reflected both the supply and demand side impact on inflation, to improve inflation forecasting. In addition, in 2020, STD carried out a project to identify suitable inflation forecasting models using time series techniques.

Near term GDP growth forecasts were prepared on a quarterly basis using both the indicator and model based techniques. Primary and secondary leading economic indicators and survey findings ranging from hard data to soft data, which were related to economic sub-activities, were combined with the expert judgments in indicator based forecasting, while model based forecasts were prepared using empirical evidence. The estimates were submitted to the management for policymaking purposes.

Further, being one of the main users of GDP estimates compiled by the DCS, views were provided periodically to DCS to widen the coverage of the GDP compilation in order to better reflect the performance of the economic activities, which are expected to be considered in the GDP rebasing process scheduled to be completed in early 2021.

29.3 Compiling Regional Statistics

(a) Sri Lanka Prosperity Index (SLPI)

SLPI is a multi-dimensional indicator developed by the Central Bank to measure the progress of the country moving beyond the aspects considered in GDP. It is compiled on an annual basis using suitable provincial indicators that represent various aspects of the lives of people and comprises three sub-indices, namely; Economic and Business Climate, Wellbeing of the People, and Socio Economic Infrastructure. In 2020, STD compiled SLPI for the year 2019 using 41 representative variables and issued a press release in December 2020.

(b) Provincial Gross Domestic Product (PGDP)

PGDP for 2019 was compiled in nominal terms by STD employing the top-down methodology. Accordingly, the National Accounts estimates of the Department

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2020

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 128

Part II

of Census and Statistics were disaggregated to the provinces using suitable indicators covering agriculture, industry, and services related activities. In the midst of data constraints caused by the pandemic, the department managed to issue the press release on the latest PGDP figures in December 2020. These estimates provide useful insights on the contribution of each province to the national GDP, and thus are beneficial for public authorities in making decisions on the allocation of resources among provinces.

29.4 Disseminating Information

Amidst the challenging conditions, the department continued its regular dissemination of official statistics during 2020 through both print and electronic modes. Addressing the need to disseminate high frequency data, STD introduced “Daily Economic Indicators”, which included data on exchange rates, the money market, share market, and energy sector on a daily basis. The two main annual statistical publications, “Economic and Social Statistics of Sri Lanka 2020 – Volume XLII” and “Sri Lanka Socio Economic Data 2020 – Volume XLIII”, were released in September 2020 in all three official languages. In 2020, the department mainly contributed to two chapters of both the Annual Report of the Central Bank and the report on Recent Economic Developments, and also continued to provide data for the Monthly Bulletin of the Central Bank.

The regular releases of the department, including the Daily Price Report of selected consumer items, and Weekly and Monthly Economic Indicators, were published on time on the Central Bank website throughout the year. Moreover, various other information was disseminated by way of press releases to the public at large, while the “Data Library”, the online database of the Central Bank, was updated and maintained to cater to the data needs of researchers and other interested parties.
