Review 
GOSL  and  the  IMF  on  21  April  2000  by  transferring 
Agreement,  decided  to  increase  the  quotas  of  each  of 
SDR  788,783  from  Sri  Lanka’s  deposit  in  the  post 
the IMF’s 189 members in January 2016. As a result, Sri 
SCA-2 
(Special  Contingent  Account)  administered 
Lanka’s IMF quota increased to SDR 578.80 Mn on 17 
account with the IMF. This account was created under 
February 2016 from the previous quota amount of SDR

held  in SCA-2 against Sri Lanka when it was  decided 
The  amounts  payable  in  respect  of  the  IMF  Quota  is 
to wind up SCA-2 by the IMF. The IMF requested the 
countries that had balances in the Post SCA-2 account 
shown under the heading Quota Liability in Note 24. A 
to  consider  providing  the  balances  in  that  account  to 
member’s quota determines that country’s financial and 
the  PRGF/HIPC  Trust  either  as  outright  grant  or  as  a 
organizational relationship with IMF, including: 
means  of  providing  a  subsidy  for  PRGF/HIPC  Loan. 
(i) 
Subscriptions:  A  member’s 
resources  is  equal  to  its  quota  and  determines  the 
maximum amount of financial resources the member 
is  obliged  to  provide  to  the  IMF.  A  member  must 
pay its subscription in full; up to 25 per cent must be 
paid in reserve assets specified by the IMF (SDRs or 
usable currencies), and the rest in the member’s own 
currency. 
 
 
 
(ii)  Voting  power:  The  quota  defines  a  member’s 
voting power in IMF decisions. IMF member’s votes 
comprise  basic  votes  plus  one  additional  vote  for 
each SDR 100,000 of quota. The 2008 reform fixed 
the  number  of  basic  vote  at  5.50  per  cent  of  total 
votes.
(iii) Access  to  financing:  The  amount  of  financing  a 
member  can  obtain  from  the  IMF  (access  limits)  is 
based  on  its  quota.  Under  Stand-By  and  Extended 
Arrangements, for instance, a member can currently 
borrow up to 145 per cent of its quota annually and 
435 per cent cumulatively. Access to finance may be 
higher in exceptional circumstances.
(iv)  SDR allocations: Members’ shares of SDR allocations 
are established in proportion to their quotas.
11.2 Holding of Special Drawing Rights
Holding  of  Special  Drawing  Rights  (SDR)  is  potentially  a 
claim  on  the  freely  usable  currencies  of  IMF  members  in 
which  holders  of  SDRs  can  exchange  their  SDRs  for  these 
currencies. The SDRs value as a reserve asset derives from 
the commitments of members to hold and accept SDRs, and 
to honor various obligations connected with the operation 
of the SDR system. The IMF ensures that the SDRs claim on 
freely  usable  currencies  is  being  honored  in  two  ways:  by 
designating IMF members with a strong external position to 
purchase SDRs from members with weak external positions, 
and 
through 
the  arrangement  of  voluntary  exchanges 
between participating members in a managed market. The 
amount  shown  above  represents  the  total  holding  of  the 
Bank as at the respective reporting dates.
