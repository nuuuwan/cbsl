Structure  and  a  Risk  Management  Structure  covering 
financial and non-financial risks confronted by the Bank. 
The Risk Governance Structure consists of the Monetary 
Board  (MB),  and  two  Board  sub-committees,  the  Board 
Risk  Oversight  Committee  (BROC)  and  the  Monetary 
Board Advisory Audit Committee (MBAAC). The MB holds 
the ultimate responsibility for the overall risk management 
function of the Bank and sets the “Tone at the Top”.  
The  BROC  was  set  up  in  August  2018  and  is  chaired 
by  Mr.  Sanjeeva  Jayawardena, 
of  the  Monetary  Board  and  comprises  two  independent

October  2020  onwards).  The  BROC  oversees  CBSL’s 
overall  Risk  Management  and  Compliance  Functions 
via a formal delegation from the MB, and is responsible 
for laying the broad strategy and policies for the Bank’s 
risk management and compliance functions. The BROC 
also  assists  the  MB  to  ensure  a  dedicated  focus  on  risk 
management and compliance at the Bank. 
The Risk Management Structure that has been put in place 
follows the Three Lines of Defence model. In the first line 
of  defence,  operational  departments  are  responsible  for 
identifying,  analysing,  evaluating, 
reviewing and reporting financial and/or operational risks 
related to their functions, through their respective reporting 
channels, in line with the risk management structure of the 
CBSL. The Risk Management Department, as a part of the
