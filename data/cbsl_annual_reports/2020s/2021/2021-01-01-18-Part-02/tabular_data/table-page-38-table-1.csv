Benefit (Asset)/Liability 
Present Value of Benefit 
The balance shown under Pension and Other Post Employment Benefit Plans in Statement of Financial Position differs 
from the net liability as per the actuary due to the following reasons: 
a)  The net asset position of the Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme is not reflected in the financial statements due to 
remote possibility of distributing any residual balance of the fund to the Bank.
b)  For both gratuity and medical benefit schemes, the financial statements represent the gross liability position and not 
the net liability as per actuary, since the Bank does not keep relevant assets in a separate fund (internally maintained).","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
