This account was created under the guidance of the IMF by transferring the balance held in SCA-2 against Sri Lanka when it was decided to wind up SCA-2 by the IMF. The IMF requested the countries that had balances in the Post SCA-2 account to consider providing the balances in that account to the PRGF/HIPC Trust either as outright grant or as a means of providing a subsidy for PRGF/HIPC Loan. Accordingly GOSL agreed to transfer the funds from Post SCA\u20132 accounts to PRGF/HIPC Trust account, not as an outright grant, but as an interest free deposit until 2018. This was later extended until 2024.",

Further, as per the Monetary Board decision MB/DG (W)/7/1/2016 dated 29 February 2016 on proposed amendments to the Profit Distribution Policy of the Bank, where Monetary Board deems necessary, transfer may be made from the MRR to Retained Earnings, in the case of negative Retained Earnings due to significant unrealized marked to market losses. Considering the marked to market gains recorded in 2019, an amount of Rs. 43.36 Bn was transferred to MRR from Retained Earnings in 2020 as per the Monetary Board decision BP MB/F/6/28/2020 dated 26 February 2020. iii).

Since the materialization of any of such risks could have an adverse impact on the financial position and the reputation of CBSL, having a properly designed risk management framework in place is vital. The recognition of the strategic importance of an integrated approach to risk management, led to the creation of a separate Risk Management Department (RMD) at CBSL in 2015 to overcome the conventional management of viewing risk in silos. Accordingly, risk management was recognized as a key strategic priority of the CBSL and the Bank is in the process of implementing an Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) Framework for CBSL.",

The MD measures the change in price of a security for a 1% change in the interest rates (yield). A higher MD indicates a higher risk. Hence, the Bank sets an appropriate MD from time to time considering the developments in the financial markets, portfolio characteristics and the risk appetite of the bond portfolio.

CBSL has signed an agreement which enable CH to lend at their wish depending on the demand for those bonds. Since the lending does not involve CBSL and CH lends them directly to the borrowers, the process is called auto bond lending. At the end of each month, custodian will send fee income for auto bond lending, if any for the bonds which they lent under auto bond lending programme.

CMD also supported the monetary policy endeavors of the Central Bank through its analyses of monetary policy expectations prior to the Monetary Board meetings and monetary policy reach subsequent to the monetary policy announcements. The former summarises policy rate predictions and forecasts by local research institutions as published in the local newspapers, and their rationales, to gauge public perceptions and expectations, while the latter strives to assess the reach of the core messages of the monetary policy review within a week after each press conference, to identify the reactions by the media to the monetary policy decisions of the Central Bank.

Accordingly, to ensure certainty of liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic, while conducting its overnight and short-term liquidity operations, the Central Bank provided long-term liquidity assistance to LCBs through the long-term reverse repo auctions for an extended period of three months. In the meantime, long-term liquidity assistance was also extended for a period up to 15 days to Standalone Primary Dealers (SPDs) through the Liquidity Support Facility (LSF). In addition, while reducing the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) to infuse a substantial amount of permanent liquidity, with the view of providing more flexibility in liquidity management, the minimum daily reserve requirement to be held by a LCB with the Central Bank was reduced from 90 per cent to 20 per cent of the required reserves on any given day. Meanwhile, standing facilities were also provided continuously to market participants to address liquidity needs on an overnight basis.",

LCBs were required to provide credit facilities to contractors and suppliers of the Government upon the receipt of a letter of acceptance for payment of outstanding bills issued by the Government and the Central Bank disbursed funds under the LFCS to LCBs based on the promissory notes from such LCBs which have been backed by Treasury bills and Treasury bonds as eligible collaterals. Under the SCRF, Central Bank provided funds to LCBs at the concessionary rate of 1.00 per cent against the pledge of a broad spectrum of collaterals, with a view to reviving businesses adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

During the year 2020, as DOD introduced process improvement by reducing manual intervention in the system, PIs were able to utilise additional time for their decision on Standing Facility due to the extension of the cut-off time for Standing Facility until 15:30 hours with effect from 06 July 2020.",

Despite the challenging working environment due to lockdowns amidst the pandemic, ERD staff provided necessary inputs and analyses for the use of the Monetary Board and the management of the Central Bank. Measures were taken to improve the compilation and dissemination of monetary and interest rate statistics during 2020, including efforts towards automating the collection and the compilation of monetary and interest rate data, and the introduction of a new monthly survey on Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) to collect micro level data across various sectors of the economy. Further, as the Secretariat of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), ERD presented comprehensive reports to the MPC on economic and monetary conditions, including forward looking analyses supported by model based macroeconomic projections, enabling the MPC to make informed judgements and make necessary recommendations to the Monetary Board on the appropriate monetary policy stance of the Central Bank. Considering the immediate need of supporting economic activity amidst the pandemic, ERD facilitated unscheduled monetary policy announcements during the year. ERD coordinated the preparation of the annual policy statement, Road Map 2021 - Monetary and Financial Sector Policies for 2021 and Beyond, in which the Central Bank announced its broad policy framework for monetary and financial sectors in the medium term, thereby providing information and guidance on the policy direction of the Central Bank to financial markets and all stakeholders of the economy. To support the efforts of the Government to revive the economy amidst the pandemic, ERD also provided recommendations to the Monetary Board on the implementation of extraordinary measures within the scope of the provisions of the MLA. While continuing assessment of risks arising from macroeconomic developments and the possible impact of such risks on inflation and economic growth, ERD provided analyses on various measures implemented by the Government, highlighting their economic implications. Further, ERD continued to facilitate Monetary Policy Consultative Committee (MPCC) meetings with the view to strengthening the monetary policy decision making process with inputs from the experts in academia and the private sector. Moreover, ERD continued to improve its inhouse modelling and forecasting capacity by expanding the fiscal and external sector modules of the model-based Forecasting and Policy Analysis System (FPAS) as a part of the continuous effort in enhancing the monetary policy decision making and communication process. Further, ERD initiated several measures to improve external communication and enhance awareness among the general public and other stakeholders, thereby helping to anchor inflation expectations in line with the envisaged inflation path over the medium term. ERD continued the publication of regular press releases on Monetary Policy Review informing the general public of the stance of the Monetary Board and",

Specifically, the Monetary Board was apprised of the developments in the domestic foreign exchange market amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in collaboration with International Operations Department. Further, ERD delivered presentations to the senior management on the external debt position of Sri Lanka, highlighting the concerns and way forward. Meanwhile, ERD continued to assess monetary implications of foreign loans obtained by the Government. Measures were also taken to improve the compilation and dissemination of external sector statistics to comply with internationally accepted data reporting standards. ERD continued the publication of Balance of Payments (BOP) statistics and International Investment Position (IIP) statistics in the BPM6 format on a quarterly basis, and the International Reserve Data Template (RDT) on a monthly basis, while submitting Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) to the World Bank and direct investment data for the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS) on an annual basis. With a view to supporting the maintenance of the external sector stability by ensuring the accuracy and timeliness of external sector data, ERD conducted several surveys during the year, including an Annual International Investment Survey (AIIS), to collect data on foreign assets and liabilities of the private sector and surveys related to trade in services covering resident and non resident airlines, shipping lines, telecommunication, construction and insurance sectors, and a monthly survey on inward workers\u2019 remittances. Further, as the lead department responsible for the implementation of the ITRS, ERD coordinated with all Licensed Commercial Banks to improve technical aspects of the ITRS with the aim of monitoring both cross border and foreign currency transactions that take place through the banking sector. The ITRS is expected to be operationalised in 2022.",

    "text": "ERD performed a prominent role in providing policy advice to the Monetary Board, the Government and other stakeholders, mainly on monetary policy, exchange rate policy, international trade and fiscal sector related issues amidst the challenges posed by the pandemic. At the onset of the pandemic, the likely challenges that the economy would face were highlighted at various fora as well as in reports to the senior management and the Government. A report was submitted to the Government in June 2020 titled Proposals to Strengthen the Economic Recovery \u2013 Post COVID-19, containing proposals on all sectors of the economy to revive activity in the immediate aftermath of the lockdown measures. A comprehensive assessment of inequalities in income and asset distribution of Sri Lanka was submitted to the Government in September 2020, in collaboration with other government agencies. The September 15th Report, which is a confidential report on developments and risks in the economy with policy suggestions was submitted to the Hon. Minister of Finance by the statutory deadline in compliance with Section 116 (1) of the MLA.

This system was operated on a voluntary basis until the EPF (Amendment) Act No. 02 of 2012 came into effect, making submission of EPF contribution details through electronic media mandatory for employers having more than 50 employees in their employment cadre. In 2011, Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) joined this system as facilitators to collect EPF contributions via their own online portals, which paved the way for a remarkable improvement in employer participation and a speedy member accounts updating process while strengthening its administrative and monitoring functionalities. The e-Return system achieved its highest technological breakthrough in 2016, with the introduction of the online member information validating mechanism, which brought 100 per cent process automation and real time updation of member accounts. Accordingly, eight LCBs are facilitating EPF online payments while four of them provide online member information validation and a real time member accounts updating facility for their customers.",

The key functions of FIU include collection and receipt of information on financial transactions for the purpose of detecting possible links to Money Laundering (ML), Terrorist Financing (TF), Proliferation Financing (PF) and other related unlawful activities defined in the FTRA, analysis of suspicious financial transactions relating to the above unlawful activities and dissemination of information of such analyses to relevant law enforcement authorities for investigation. The country\u2019s AML/CFT regime also consists of two others major (pieces of) legislation, i.e. the Prevention of Money Laundering Act No. 5 of 2006 (PMLA) and the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act No. 25 of 2005 (CSTFA), where FIU is involved in implementing their provisions effectively.",

Therefore, with a view of addressing the need for a comprehensive assessment on the risks emanating from the corporate sector to financial system stability, MSD introduced scenario stress testing to corporate sector risk profiles.

The Financial Stress Index, a new stability indicator, was constructed by MSD during the year to identify periods when strains on the financial system impair its intermediation function. This index combines indicators from the equities market, bond market, foreign exchange market and banking sector into a composite index to assess the degree of stress in the financial system. MSD expanded the scope of stress testing further by initiating a liquidity stress testing framework in the banking sector and the licensed finance companies sector during the year 2020 and intends to introduce a dynamic stress testing framework in 2021.",

Under this TA program, it is envisaged that improvements would be made to data collection and analysis, the depth of the stress testing functionality via International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) based dynamic stress tests, improving risk surveillance by enhancing the forward-looking element, the calibration of policy instruments, and improving the governance structure of macroprudential policy making. Accordingly, the first batch of data collection on interconnectedness and stress testing related to credit risk was initiated by MSD by developing structured templates and reporting guidelines with the support of the TA received from the IMF to collect the required granular data and issuing the same to licensed banks in December 2020. Further, MSD intends to conduct its second batch of data collection on market risk, interest rate risk, profitability and risk weighted assets modules in its stress testing toolkit in 2021.",

In addition, SD promptly attended a number of time-critical ad-hoc procurements. Further, SD contributed to the procurement of goods and services under the Financial Sector Modernisation Project of the World Bank. Considering postal delays and their impact on the tender processes due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation, with the support of the Information Technology Department (ITD), SD introduced an on-line internet mode for tender-based procurements, while ensuring adequate security measures. This enabled SD to attend to tenders timely, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic when procuring Goods and Services. In addition, SD implemented a new Stationery Management System with the assistance of ITD for facilitating effective and efficient stationery management of the Central Bank.",

During 2020, the Central Bank commenced 50 investigations based on complaints and information received subsequent to re-establishment of the Investigation Unit in the DSNBFI. One entity was determined by the Monetary Board as accepting deposits and carrying on finance business in contravention of the provisions of the FBA and was referred to the Hon. Attorney General for the institution of criminal proceedings. In addition, field visits were completed with respect to another institution while information was called under Section 42(1) of the FBA from another 33 companies. Further, relevant parties, i.e., complainants, other government organisations, and the Central Bank Regional Offices have been requested to submit more information with respect to another 15 investigations.",
