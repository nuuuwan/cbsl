6.1 OverviewF

iscal performance weakened in 2019 amidst

a notable decline in government revenue,

resulting mainly from the impact of the large

import compression particularly of motor vehicles,

and subdued economic activity exacerbated by the

Easter Sunday attacks in April 2019, as well as the

rise in recurrent expenditure mainly on account of

subsidies and transfers, and salaries and wages.

Accordingly, revenue from indirect taxes declined

significantly in 2019, offsetting the noteworthy

gains in income tax revenue supported by the

implementation of the new Inland Revenue Act.

Meanwhile, the postponement of the government

Budget 2019, which was subsequently approved in

April 2019, and the execution of fiscal operations on

a Vote on Account in the first four months in 2019

prior to the approval of the Budget 2019 also weighed

on revenue mobilisation to some extent in 2019.

Consequently, the major fiscal balances in 2019

deviated significantly from the budget estimates

as well as from the levels recorded in 2018 The

deficit in the government current account widened

substantially despite a surplus being envisaged in

the Budget 2019, implying increased dissavings

of the government. The primary balance, which is

the difference between government revenue and

non-interest expenditure and an important indicator

of debt sustainability, returned to negative levels,

compared to the surplus balance recorded in the

preceding two years. The overall budget deficit

expanded significantly in 2019, compared to the

budget estimates and the deficit recorded in 2018.

Government revenue declined to 12.6 per cent of

GDP in 2019 from 13.4 per cent of GDP in 2018,

mainly due to the reduction in tax revenue from

excise duties on motor vehicle imports, while a

lower revenue collection was recorded from Value

Added Tax (VAT), Cess and Ports and Airports

Development Levy (PAL) as well. Revenue from

direct taxes rose to 2.8 per cent of GDP in 2019

from 2.2 per cent of GDP in 2018, reflecting the

increase in revenue mainly from corporate taxes

under the new Inland Revenue Act. However,

the reduction in indirect tax revenue due to lower

imports and the overall moderation of activity

outweighed the gains in income tax in 2019.

Further, non tax revenue declined to 1.0 per cent

of GDP in 2019 from 1.4 per cent of GDP in 2018

due to lower revenue from fees and charges,

non-availability of distributable profits from the

Central Bank and the reduction in profit and dividend

transfers from State Owned Business Enterprises

(SOBEs). Meanwhile, government expenditure

and net lending as a percentage of GDP increased

to 19.4 per cent in 2019 from 18.7 per cent in

2018 due to the increase in recurrent expenditure

amidst a decline in public investment. Recurrent

expenditure, as a percentage of GDP, increased to

15.3 per cent in 2019 from 14.5 per cent in 2018,

while capital expenditure and net lending declined

to 4.1 per cent in 2019 from 4.2 per cent in 2018.

Accordingly, the government’s current account

deficit rose to 2.7 per cent of GDP, compared to

the expected surplus of 0.2 per cent and the deficit

of 1.2 per cent in 2018. The primary balance

recorded a deficit of 0.8 per cent of GDP in 2019

compared to the surplus of 0.6 per cent of GDP in

2018, reversing the improvements recorded since

2017. Accordingly, the budget deficit increased to

6.8 per cent of GDP in 2019, compared to the deficit

of 5.3 per cent of GDP in 2018 and the estimated

4.4 per cent of GDP in the Budget 2019. Deficit

financing relied mainly on domestic sources, which

accounted for 69.1 per cent on net basis in 2019.

In net domestic financing, both bank and non bank

sources recorded an increase during the year.

The central government debt to GDP ratio rose to

86.8 per cent of GDP by end 2019 from

83.7 per cent at end 2018, mainly reflecting the

impact of the increased budget deficit and the

relatively modest growth in nominal GDP in 2019.

The government initiated two rounds of fiscal

stimulus in 2019. The first round of easing measures

commenced in response to the devastating impact

of the Easter Sunday attacks, while the second

round of easing measures commenced after the

Presidential election, aimed at addressing persistent

subpar economic growth. Major fiscal easing

measures in the first round included the reduction of

the VAT rate from 15 per cent to 7 per cent on hotels

and tour operators, to support the revival of the tourism

industry and tax exemptions on the importation of

security equipment following the Easter Sunday

attacks. The second round of fiscal easing

measures comprised significant tax concessions

and simplifications, aimed at increasing the

disposable income of economic agents, thereby

encouraging investment and consumption, which

would help enhance revenue growth over the

medium term. Such major measures included

amendments to the Inland Revenue Act, No. 24 of

2017; a broadbased reduction of the VAT rate to

8 per cent, except for financial services; and removal

of Nation Building Tax (NBT) and Withholding Tax

(WHT). In addition, measures were also taken to

curtail government expenditure of both recurrent

and capital nature, recouping in part the negative

impact of revenue reforms in the near term.

Meanwhile, the government introduced several

health policy and fiscal measures in response to the

spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country,

including the provision of necessary expenditure

allocations for health facilities, imposing maximum

retail prices for essential food items and facilitating

the distribution of food items during periods of social

distancing, and other regulatory measures to contain

the spread of the pandemic further in the country.

The suboptimal outcome in fiscal operations in

2019 underscores the necessity for strengthening

fiscal consolidation in the period ahead, supported

by prudent expenditure rationalisation and revenue

enhancement. The ongoing fiscal stimulus could

help boost economic activity albeit fiscal slippages

could be expected in the near term. However,

as economic activity recovers in the period

ahead, government revenue can be impacted

positively. In this context, efforts to improve the

tax administration and compliance would need to

continue in order to help realise the benefits of

revenue mobilisation. Further, curtailing the fast

rising recurrent expenditure of the government

would also help strengthen fiscal balances over

the medium term. Widening of the deficit in the

government’s current account and reversal of

gains in the primary balance, if continued, could

undermine fiscal consolidation efforts and seriously

challenge debt sustainability in the period ahead

unless real economic activity boosts up significantly.

Further, the expanded budget deficits, unless

contained, could result in narrowing the fiscal space

needed for public investment in the areas of health,

education and social protection, thereby resulting

in a deterioration of productivity and dampened

economic growth, endangering poverty alleviation

efforts of the government. Against this backdrop,

it is imperative that government spending is

directed towards growth-enhancing sectors, while

strengthening governance to contain and eliminate

any inefficient and unproductive use of resources as

envisaged by the government. Further, the effective

use of active liability management operations and

adherence to the Medium-Term Debt Management

Strategy (MTDS) are vital to smoothen debt service

payments over the medium term, and ensure debt

sustainability.

6.2 Fiscal Policy Direction and

Measures1

Fiscal consolidation encountered significant

challenges in 2019 amidst the notable decline in

government revenue and the rise in recurrent

expenditure. Government revenue declined mainly

due to significantly low revenue from indirect taxes

amidst the contraction of imports, and persistent

subpar economic activity particularly following the

Easter Sunday attacks. The reduction in revenue

from indirect taxes overshadowed the noteworthy

increase in income tax revenue under the newly

implemented Inland Revenue Act. Meanwhile,

recurrent expenditure grew substantially on account

of rising expenditure on subsidies and transfers

and salaries and wages, while public investment

moderated in light of the substandard revenue

performance. Accordingly, the major fiscal indicators

deviated significantly from the estimates as reflected

in the increase in the deficit of the government’s

current account balance and the overall budget

balance, while the primary balance also recorded a

deficit following the surplus balance maintained in the

preceding two years. Amidst concerns of moderation

of activity in the aftermath of the Easter Sunday

attacks, the government lowered the Value Added

Tax (VAT) rate applicable in the tourism industry,

while granting exemptions on the importation of

security equipment. Meanwhile, another round of

fiscal stimulus was launched towards the end of

2019, to address persistently low economic growth

by offering a series of tax concessions, along with

other reforms, aimed at increasing disposable

income, and encouraging private consumption and

investment. Further, the government took several

measures to curtail both recurrent and non-priority

capital expenditure, thereby attempting to minimise

the impact of tax revisions on government revenue

in the near term.

Fiscal operations were conducted on a Vote

on Account (VoA) during January through

early April 2019, due to the delay in presenting

the government Budget for 2019 amidst the

unforeseen political developments in the latter

part of 2018. Accordingly, a VoA for the first four

months of 2019 was approved by the Parliament in

December 2018. Consequently, the Appropriation

Bill for 2019 was submitted to the Parliament on

05 February 2019, and the government Budget

for 2019 was presented on 05 March 2019 and

approved by the Parliament on 05 April 2019.

Meanwhile, the submission of the Budget for 2020

was also delayed amidst the Presidential election

held in November 2019. Accordingly, a VoA for

the first four months of 2020 was approved by the

Parliament in October 2019, by postponing the

preparations of the government Budget for 2020.2

Meanwhile, the Parliament was dissolved on

03 March 2020 and the nominations of candidates

were accepted by the Election Commission for the

general election, which was scheduled to be held

on 25 April 2020. However, the general election

was postponed by the Election Commission due

to the COVID-19 outbreak.3 Accordingly, the

submission of the government Budget for 2020

could be delayed, which would limit the space for

implementing new fiscal measures for 2020.

Following the Presidential election in

November 2019, revisions were introduced to

the Inland Revenue Act, No. 24 of 2017, aimed at

simplifying the tax structure and providing tax

concessions, thereby enhancing disposable

income and supporting the revival of subdued

economic activity.4 Accordingly, revisions were

introduced to the personal income tax rates,

tax free threshold and tax slabs with effect from

01 January 2020. The annual tax free threshold

2 Before the expiration of the approved period of the VoA, if Parliament is in session, the government has to obtain an approval for an annual Budget or a VoA from the Parliament to utilise funds from the Consolidated Fund for the use of public services. However, as the Parliament was dissolved on 03 March 2020 without approving an annual Budget or a VoA, H.E. the President was vested with the powers to authorise government expenditure for public services under paragraph 3 of Article 150 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka until the expiry of three months from the date on which the Parliament is summoned. In this regard, H.E. the President empowered the Secretary to the Treasury with powers regarding spending monies from the Consolidated Fund to continue public services and development activities initially during the three months starting from 06 March 2020.3 Meanwhile, on 20 April 2020, the Election Commission announced that the general election will be scheduled for 20 June 2020.4 Policy measures announced by the Inland Revenue Department, which were implement-ed with effect from 01 January 2020, are subject to the approval of the Parliament.

any source of income from Rs. 1.2 million per

annum for employment income and Rs. 500,000

free threshold was increased to Rs. 3.0 million per

annum from Rs. 600,000 per annum. Personal

income tax rates were simplified and revised to

6 per cent, 12 per cent and 18 per cent,

compared to the previous structure of 4 per cent,

8 per cent, 12 per cent, 16 per cent, 20 per cent and

24 per cent. Moreover, Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE)

tax on any employment receipts to any resident

or non-resident person was removed with effect

from 01 January 2020. Accordingly, an employee

whose income exceeds Rs. 3.0 million per annum

is liable to pay personal income tax at 6 per cent,

12 per cent and 18 per cent subject to the tax

slabs of Rs. 3.0 million for each step. Meanwhile,

the corporate income tax rate applicable for the

construction industry was reduced to 14 per cent

from 28 per cent, and the same for the banking,

finance, insurance industries and trading activities

was reduced to 24 per cent from 28 per cent with

effect from 01 January 2020. Further, Withholding

Tax (WHT) and Economic Service Charge (ESC)

were removed with effect from 01 January 2020.

Nevertheless, the applicability of WHT would

continue on the amounts paid for winning lotteries,

rewards, betting and gambling, sale of any gem

at an auction conducted by the National Gem and

Jewellery Authority, and payments made to any

non-resident person.

Revisions were made to the VAT and the

Nation Building Tax (NBT) in 2019 in further

support of businesses and economic growth

prospects. In an immediate response to help

the tourism industry following the Easter Sunday

attacks, the VAT rate was reduced to 7 per cent

from 15 per cent on the supply of services by a

hotel, guest house, restaurant or other similar

business providing similar services, and supply

of services in respect of inbound tours by a travel

agent registered with the Sri Lanka Tourism

Development Authority (SLTDA), for the period

from 01 June 2019 until 31 March 2020. However,

amidst concerns of persistent slowdown of

economic activity in the recent years, the VAT rate

was reduced to 8 per cent from 15 per cent across

the board, except for financial services, with effect

from 01 December 2019, aimed at stimulating

investment and consumption over the medium

term. Moreover, VAT exemptions were granted

for the importation of fabrics, supply of residential

accommodation by way of sale of condominium

housing units by any person, and supply of services

by a hotel, guest house, restaurant or other similar

business providing similar services registered

with the SLTDA, which uses 60 per cent or more

of their inputs from local suppliers with effect from

01 December 2019. Further, the VAT registration

threshold was increased substantially to Rs. 300

million per annum from Rs. 12 million per annum with

effect from 01 January 2020. In addition, the NBT

was removed with effect from 01 December 2019.

Revisions were made to excise duty in view

of easing pressure on the balance of payments

especially on account of motor vehicle

imports, while discouraging the consumption

of sweetened beverages and cigarettes owing

to health concerns. As announced in the Budget

2019, excise duty on motor vehicles of an engine

capacity less than 2,000 cm3 was increased

with effect from 06 March 2019. However,

excise duty on electric vehicles was reduced

to promote environmentally friendly transport

modes. Meanwhile, excise duty on beverages

was increased on the basis of the sugar content

of the product. Further, with effect from 06 March

2019, excise duties on cigarettes and locally

manufactured liquor were increased based on

an indexation method with a minimum annual

duty increase reflecting annual inflation and GDP

growth. In addition, excise duty on cigarettes was

increased in December 2019, which could help

in part offset any revenue reduction that may be

caused due to the revision to the VAT.

The Customs duty structure was revised

in 2019 mainly in response to changes in

commodity prices in global markets. Accordingly,

several revisions were introduced to fuel prices in

accordance with the fuel pricing formula that was

in force until October 2019. Consequently, at end

December 2019, Customs duties applicable on

the importation of auto diesel, super diesel, petrol

(92 Octane) and petrol (95 Octane) remained at

Rs. 2.85 per litre, Rs. 15 per litre, Rs. 18 per litre

and Rs. 35 per litre, respectively. In addition, under

the Extraordinary Gazette No. 2113/2, Customs

duty on undenatured ethyl alcohol and tyre tubes

was increased, while Customs duty on go-karts was

exempted. Moreover, the unit rate of the Customs

duty on the importation of 261 items of goods was

increased by 10 per cent with effect from 06 March

2019.

The Special Commodity Levy (SCL) was

revised along with the revisions to Cess and

Ports and Airports Development Levy (PAL)

during the year in order to support domestic

producers while reducing any price volatility

in the domestic market. SCL on the importation

of black gram, dates (fresh and dried), oranges

(fresh), apples (fresh) and vegetable oil was

revised upward, while an SCL of Rs. 8 per kg on

wheat flour imports was imposed during the year.

SCL on the importation of b’onions, maize, fish

(fresh, chilled or frozen), potatoes and chillies

(dried, neither crushed nor ground) was reduced

to curtail price volatility in the domestic market.

Moreover, Cess on the importation of 25 items was

removed in March 2019, while PAL on selected

items was reduced to 2.5 per cent from 7.5 per cent

in March 2019. However, PAL on selected items

was revised upward to 10 per cent with effect from

06 December 2019 in order to support the revenue

mobilisation efforts of the government.

Amendments to the Finance Act as proposed

in the government Budget 2019 were approved

by Parliament in October 2019. Accordingly, the

luxury tax on motor vehicles was amended to the

effect that the tax payable is determined purely

on the cost, insurance and freight (CIF) value or

the manufacturer’s price (in case of domestic

production, in excess of a prescribed tax free

threshold) irrespective of the engine capacity.

This amendment helped support the government

revenue while curtailing the excessive expenditure

on motor vehicle imports. Meanwhile, the carbon

tax was removed with effect from 01 December

2019.

Fees and charges, which have not been

revised since 2016, were changed as proposed

in the government Budget 2019 in view of

enhancing government revenue. Accordingly,

passport processing fees on regular basis, urgent

basis, and alterations were increased by Rs. 500,

Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 500 respectively to Rs. 3,500,

Rs. 15,000 and Rs. 1,000. Under the Extraordinary

Gazette No. 2116/62, the embarkation levy was

increased by US dollars 10 to US dollars 60 per

passenger effective from April 2019. However, as

per the Extraordinary Gazette No. 2134/5 issued in

August 2019, the increase of the embarkation levy

was revoked and the previous rate of US dollars

50 per passenger was made applicable during

August 2019 through January 2020 considering the

adverse impact on the tourism industry following

the Easter Sunday attacks, while the increased rate

of US dollars 60 per passenger was made effective

from February 2020 onwards.

Measures were taken to strengthen tax

administration during the year. The Revenue

Administration Management Information System

(RAMIS) of the Inland Revenue Department (IRD)

was upgraded in order to incorporate the provisions

of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 24 of 2017. With the

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

214

6

inclusion of VAT on financial services and personal

income tax registrations, the RAMIS monitors all

tax categories, except the ESC, stamp duty and

the betting and gaming levy. Several programmes

were conducted to enhance public awareness

on the RAMIS, which helped, together with new

registrations, increase the number of registered

tax files in IRD by 38,622 to 1,220,178 in 2019.

Moreover, the IRD commenced the implementation

of organisational and business procedure reforms

to modernise tax administration. Such measures

included restructuring of the IRD along the

functional lines, creating a Design and Monitoring

Unit, introducing a more efficient management

structure to speed up interaction with taxpayers,

strengthening the Large Taxpayer Unit, introducing

mandatory e-filing, and enhancing the use of

taxpayer identification numbers. Meanwhile, the

Sri Lanka Customs initiated measures to establish

a National Single Window (NSW) for facilitating

importers and exporters. In this regard, 12 technical

reports pertaining to different categories of NSW

were handed over to the Ministry of Finance (MOF)5

in July 2019.

Measures were introduced to improve the

management of public expenditure during

the year. As announced in the Budget 2019, the

MOF instructed all ministries and departments in

April 2019 to curtail their capital expenditure by

15 per cent in 2019. In addition, the MOF, in

September 2019, advised all ministries and

departments to curtail their capital expenditure

by a further 10 per cent by postponing

non-priority projects, new projects and purchases of

non-essential goods. Moreover, by the National

Budget Circular No. 04/2019, all government

institutions were advised to implement prudent

expenditure control measures while rationalising

recurrent expenditure, particularly on electricity,

telephone, water supply, fuel consumption and

stationery. Following the Presidential election in

November 2019 and subsequent tax concessions

announced to support the revival of economic

activity, the MOF instructed all ministries and

departments to implement expenditure control

measures to ensure effective management of

public expenditure, especially in consideration of

the decline in revenue collection in the near term.

Moreover, under the National Budget Circular No.

06/2019, instructions were issued to all ministries

and departments to submit their supplementary

budgetary requests through the Integrated Treasury

Management Information System (ITMIS).

Public sector salaries were increased with

effect from July 2019, and pension anomalies

were rectified as proposed in the Budget 2019.

An interim allowance of Rs. 2,500 per month was

granted to public sector employees with effect

from 01 July 2019. Further, measures were taken

to rectify pension anomalies for those who retired

before 01 January 2016. Therefore, a revision

was made incorporating the first two phases of

the Public Administration Circular No. 03/2016

to the basic salary of the pensioner at the time

of retirement effective from 01 July 2019. Under

the Pension Circular No. 03/2015 (Revision III),

the automation process of the pension payment

procedure was further strengthened by improving

the efficiency and standards of public service

delivery. Under the Public Administration Circular

No. 02/2019, instructions were issued to prevent

any fraudulent activities with regard to pension

payments, especially in relation to demised

pensioners. Meanwhile, Divisional Secretaries

were instructed to keep the register of pensioners

up-to-date. Further, the National Pay Commission

was established in February 2020 with a view to

maintaining sustainability of salaries and wages

in both public and private sectors. This special

FISCAL POLICY AND GOVERNMENT FINANCE

215

agency consists of 15 members, who are expected

to revisit all remuneration structures of the public

sector as well as the private sector, and advise

and assist the government in formulating and

implementing a national wage policy.

The government embarked on a targeted

recruitment programme aimed at uplifting

the living standards of underprivileged

households, while ensuring their productive

contribution to the economy. Accordingly, the

government commenced a programme in January

2020 to recruit 100,000 unskilled individuals with

low levels of education from low income families.

These recruits are expected to receive targeted

training in the first six months with an allowance of

Rs. 22,500 per month, before they are recruited in to

the public-sector cadre. Moreover, the government

commenced another recruitment programme

in February 2020 to provide employment

opportunities for all unemployed graduates and

diploma holders who had remained unemployed

during the preceding three years. These recruits

are to be given suitable training for one year, with a

monthly allowance of Rs. 20,000, after which they

would be deployed across Sri Lanka.

Measures were taken to enhance the

transparency of welfare benefit schemes with

the aim of streamlining the major welfare

programmes. Accordingly, the Welfare Benefits

Board (WBB) published a selection methodology

in June 2019 for the identification of low income

families for welfare benefit payments in respect

of four main welfare programmes.6 Moreover,

measures were taken to expand the number of

Samurdhi beneficiaries by 433,594 in August

2019, in line with the Budget proposal in 2019 to

expand the number of Samurdhi beneficiaries by

600,000.

6 Samurdhi programme, financial support for elderly over 70 years of age, support for low income disabled persons and financial support for kidney patients

Several initiatives were taken to improve

the financial viability of major State Owned

Business Enterprises (SOBEs), thereby

reducing the burden on the central government

budget. Performance reports for the first half

of 2018 of the five SOBEs, which had signed

Statements of Corporate Intent (SCIs) in March

2017, were forwarded to the Cabinet of Ministers

in August 2019. Further, eight SCIs7 were signed

in June 2019 with selected SOBEs to improve

the efficiency of their operations. Approval was

granted by the Cabinet of Ministers in March 2019

to implement a pricing formula for imported milk

powder in line with the changes in international milk

powder prices and fluctuations in the exchange

rate in order to reflect the actual market costs, while

safeguarding the local milk industry. In addition,

approval was granted by the Cabinet of Ministers

in October 2019 to implement a pricing formula

for Liquefied Petroleum (LP) gas. Moreover, a

special committee was established in early 2020

to appoint qualified and talented personnel for key

positions of SOBEs, in order to strengthen the

financial viability of those institutions.

In 2019, measures were taken to make

use of the Active Liability Management Act

(ALMA), No. 8 of 2018, while the Medium-

Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS) was

formulated with the aim of strengthening debt

sustainability. In June 2019, a resolution was

passed in Parliament to raise Rs. 480 billion for

liability management purposes. Accordingly,

Treasury bonds amounting to Rs. 15 billion

in October 2019 and another Rs. 15 billion in

December 2019 were raised to build buffers for

liability management purposes. Such funds raised

in 2019 were utilised for the settlement of debt

service obligations during early 2020. Meanwhile,

opportunities to raise funds from foreign markets

including the SAMURAI bond market were explored

with the aim of diversifying the international capital

market issuance base while building buffers for

debt management. Moreover, the MTDS for the

period 2019-2023 was launched in April 2019,

formulated collectively by the Central Bank and

the Ministry of Finance. The MTDS mainly focuses

on containing the foreign currency exposure of

central government debt, improving the average

time to maturity (ATM) of the debt portfolio, and

minimising the share of debt maturing within the

period of the next twelve months. In line with

the envisaged targets in the MTDS, the share of

foreign currency debt and debt maturing within

one year were maintained at favourable levels at

end 2019, and the ATM of foreign currency debt

portfolio increased in 2019.

Measures were taken during 2019 to

improve the transparency and efficiency of

the government securities market. In order

to facilitate investment and enhance investor

awareness on government securities, the

LankaSecure system was upgraded to deliver a

real time notification to customers registered in

the Central Depository System by Dealer Direct

Participants (Licensed Commercial Banks and

Primary Dealers) for every debit and credit record

of scripless securities. A circular was issued to

participants of the LankaSettle System requesting

information on the settlement value, price and

interest rate of every securities transaction in the

LankaSecure System with effect from 01 January

2020. Meanwhile, in view of limiting the possible

impact of the increased volatility in global financial

markets, the Central Bank reduced the threshold

for foreign investment in rupee denominated

government securities from 10 per cent of the

outstanding government securities stock to

5 per cent with effect from 18 January 2019.

The primary balance target set under the

Quantitative Performance Criteria (QPC) of

the International Monetary Fund’s Extended

Fund Facility (IMF-EFF) programme was

missed in 2019. The IMF-EFF programme

was obtained in June 2016 with the aim of

strengthening the country’s external sector while

supporting the government’s economic reform

agenda. The programme included measures to

rebuild foreign exchange reserves and reduce

fiscal deficits, thereby containing the government

debt accumulation while restoring overall

macroeconomic stability.

The government announced several urgent

measures amidst the spread of the COVID-19

pandemic in the country during March 2020.

With the view of providing relief particularly for

low income households, maximum retail prices

(MRP) were announced for selected consumer

goods such as dhal, canned fish, broiler chicken,

maize, b'onions and certain medical items.

Meanwhile, the Cabinet of Ministers granted

approval for the allocation of funds on an urgent

basis for various purposes, including Rs. 5 billion

for settling payment arrears of small and medium

scale contractors; Rs. 10 billion for settling arrears

to private institutions on account of purchasing

of pharmaceuticals; and Rs. 3 billion for settling

procurement bills of purchasing of fertiliser.

Further, the government allocated additional

Rs. 500 million for Covid-19 preventive

activities. Moreover, several concessions were

granted to the tourism, textile and garments and

wholesale and retail trade sectors, which were

largely affected by the impact of the COVID-19

pandemic. Meanwhile, the government initiated

measures in March 2020 to establish a fuel price

stabilisation fund (FPSF), thereby aiming to

raise a sum of Rs. 200 billion within 6 months by

FISCAL POLICY AND GOVERNMENT FINANCE

217

utilising the benefit of lower fuel prices prevailing

in the global market. Moreover, the government

introduced a cash grant of Rs. 5,000 as a lump

sum payment for the low income and vulnerable

families and individuals, who were affected by

the COVID-19 outbreak.

Major international rating agencies affirmed

Sri Lanka’s sovereign credit rating although

their outlook for Sri Lanka was revised. Fitch

Ratings and S&P Global Ratings affirmed Sri

Lanka’s rating at “B”, while revising the outlook

from “Stable” to “Negative” in December 2019

and January 2020, respectively. Such revision

of the outlook was mainly attributed to risks

stemming from deteriorated fiscal position of the

country. However, Moody’s Investors Service

(Moody’s) maintained its ratings at “B2” with

“Stable” outlook in 2019.

In view of strengthening the medium

term fiscal framework, further measures

are needed to ensure the effective

implementation of revenue enhancement

and expenditure rationalisation measures.

Despite several reform measures initiated to

enhance government revenue in the recent past,

the level and structure of government revenue

remain highly susceptible to aggregate demand

management measures implemented from time

to time. For instance, a major part of the revenue

decline 2019 can be attributed to the moderation

of excise duty collection, reflecting mainly the

impact of import curtailing measures introduced

amidst the surge in personal motor vehicle

imports began in 2018. Despite such decline

in government revenue, recurrent expenditure

increased notably in 2019 mainly reflecting a rise

in expenditure on subsidies and transfers and

salaries and wages. Consequently, key fiscal

balances and outstanding debt levels deviated

sharply from the envisaged levels in 2019,

underscoring the need for strengthening fiscal

consolidation measures. Interest payments have

become the single largest component in recurrent

expenditure, while the wage bill of the government

employees and pension payments continue to

rise, limiting the fiscal space for much needed

public investment. Meanwhile, the rising levels of

expenditure on welfare payments and subsidies

continue to weigh on the government budget.

Moreover, the financially constrained SOBEs

with large debt liabilities continue to pose risks

on the government budget. In this backdrop, it is

important that adequate measures are initiated

to strengthen government revenue mobilisation,

particularly in the context of renewed risks

to economic recovery amidst the widespread

COVID-19 outbreak globally and its adverse

impact on fiscal policy and debt sustainability

in Sri Lanka. The measures initiated in 2019 to

curtail non-priority government expenditure are

commendable. It is important that the benefits

accrued from such measures are sustained,

particularly amidst rising pressures in the near

term due to bulk recruitments to the public sector.

Moreover, reforms to transform loss-making

SOBEs need to be expedited to ease pressure

on the government budget and strengthen fiscal

consolidation over the medium term. Further,

an effective use of active liability management

operations and adherence to the MTDS could

prove critical to help smooth debt service payment

obligations, while reducing government debt to a

sustainable level over the medium term. In this

context, measures to strengthen fiscal discipline

by adopting stringent and binding fiscal rules

remain essential to bolster investor confidence

and improve the country’s macroeconomic

outlook in the period ahead.

6.3 Government Budgetary Operations

Revenue and Grants

Revenue

In 2019, total revenue as a percentage of

GDP declined due to the reduction in both

tax and non tax revenue. Accordingly, total

government revenue declined to 12.6 per cent of

GDP in 2019 from 13.4 per cent of GDP in 2018.

Tax revenue declined to 11.6 per cent of GDP in

2019 from 11.9 per cent of GDP in 2018 as a result

of the lower revenue collection from excise duties,

VAT, SCL, Cess, and PAL despite a significant

increase in revenue collection from income taxes.

Similarly, non tax revenue declined to 1.0 per

cent of GDP in 2019 from 1.4 per cent of GDP in

2018 due to lower revenue from fees and charges,

non-availability of distributable profits from the

Central Bank and reduction in profit and dividend

transfers from SOBEs.

In nominal terms, total revenue declined

to Rs. 1,890.9 billion in 2019 from Rs. 1,920.0

billion in 2018 as the reduction in non tax

revenue outweighed the marginal increase in

tax revenue collection. Tax revenue increased

by 1.3 per cent to Rs. 1,734.9 billion reflecting the

significant increase in revenue from income taxes,

although revenue collection from excise duties,

VAT, SCL, Cess, PAL and NBT declined during

the year. Revenue from indirect taxes continued

to be the major contributor to the government

coffers, accounting for 75.3 per cent of total tax

revenue in 2019. However, a notable increase

was observed in the share of revenue from direct

taxes which rose to 24.7 per cent in 2019 from

18.1 per cent in the previous year, reflecting the

impact of the implementation of the new Inland

Revenue Act, No. 24 of 2017, with effect from

01 April 2018. Meanwhile, non tax revenue declined

to Rs. 156.0 billion in 2019 from Rs. 207.7 billion in

2018, resulting in the share of tax revenue in total

revenue increasing to 91.8 per cent in 2019 from

89.2 per cent in 2018.

Revenue from income tax increased during

the year both as a percentage of GDP and in

nominal terms mainly due to the increase in

revenue collection from corporate and non

corporate income taxes. Accordingly, revenue

from income taxes as a percentage of GDP

increased to 2.8 per cent in 2019 from 2.2 per cent

in 2018, while in nominal terms, income tax revenue

collection increased significantly by 37.8 per cent

to Rs. 427.7 billion during the year. Revenue

from corporate and non corporate income taxes

increased by 60.4 per cent to Rs. 272.6 billion in

2019, reflecting the impact of the implementation

of the new Inland Revenue Act as well as

administrative improvements in the tax payment

and return monitoring process of the IRD. Revenue

from PAYE tax also improved during the year by

19.5 per cent to Rs. 49.4 billion in 2019. Further,

revenue from withholding tax increased to Rs. 50.4

billion in 2019 from Rs. 46.4 billion in 2018, while

revenue from ESC increased to Rs. 55.3 billion in

2019 from Rs. 53.0 billion in 2018, reflecting also

the impact of awareness programmes conducted by

the IRD to increase the WHT and ESC registrations

during 2019. Further, revenue collection from

Capital Gains Tax (CGT) increased to Rs. 602.4

million in 2019 from Rs. 104.1 million in 2018.

In 2019, revenue from VAT declined both as

a percentage of GDP and in nominal terms due

to dampened economic activity during the year.

Accordingly, as a percentage of GDP, revenue

from VAT declined to 3.0 per cent in 2019 from

3.2 per cent in 2018, while in nominal terms VAT

revenue declined by 3.9 per cent to Rs. 443.9

billion in 2019. The revenue collection from VAT

on domestic economic activities declined by

3.0 per cent to Rs. 274.0 billion in 2019, while

revenue from VAT on import related activities

declined by 5.2 per cent to Rs. 169.9 billion.

Accordingly, VAT revenue as a percentage of

total tax revenue declined to 25.6 per cent during

the year from 27.0 per cent in 2018. Accordingly,

the contribution of VAT revenue to total revenue

declined marginally to 23.5 per cent in 2019 from

24.0 per cent in 2018.

Revenue from excise duties declined as

a percentage of GDP as well as in nominal

terms in 2019. Revenue from excise duties as a

percentage of GDP declined to 2.7 per cent during

the year from 3.4 per cent in the previous year,

while declining by 17.5 per cent in nominal terms

to Rs. 399.5 billion in 2019 mainly on account of

lower revenue from excise duty on motor vehicles,

petroleum products and cigarettes. Annual

revenue collection from excise duty on motor

vehicles declined significantly by 36.1 per cent

(0.9 per cent of GDP) to Rs. 130.4 billion in 2019

from Rs. 204.1 billion in 2018. This was mainly due

to the decline in motor vehicle imports amidst the

imposition of higher excise duties in March 2019

and the restrictions that were in place until April

2019, on opening of Letters of Credit (LCs) for

the importation of motor vehicles. Revenue from

excise duty on petroleum products declined by

6.9 per cent to Rs. 61.7 billion due to the decline in

petrol imports during the year and the reduction of

excise duty on the importation of auto diesel during

the latter part of 2018. Moreover, revenue from

excise duty on cigarettes and tobacco declined

by 5.3 per cent to Rs. 87.4 billion mainly due to

the decline in cigarette sales. However, revenue

from excise duty on liquor increased marginally by

1.3 per cent to Rs. 115.4 billion in 2019 due to the

increase in excise duty on both locally manufactured

and imported liquor. Meanwhile, the share of

excise tax revenue in total tax revenue declined to

23.0 per cent in 2019 from 28.3 per cent recorded

in the previous year.

In nominal terms in 2019, revenue collection

from import duties increased while revenue

from SCL declined in comparison to 2018.

Revenue from import duties, in nominal terms,

increased by 1.5 per cent to Rs. 98.4 billion in 2019

reflecting the increase in applicable duty rates on

petrol and diesel, and the increase in import duty

on selected 261 items as proposed in the Budget

2019. However, revenue from SCL declined, in

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

220

6

nominal terms, by 7.2 per cent to Rs. 70.4 billion

during the year. The share of import duties in tax

revenue remained unchanged at 5.7 per cent during

the year while the share of SCL in tax revenue

declined to 4.1 per cent in 2019 from 4.4 per cent in

the previous year.

Revenue collection from PAL, Cess and

NBT also declined, reflecting the impact of

tax exemptions and concessions granted on

the importation of several goods during the

year. Accordingly, revenue from PAL declined by

1.6 per cent to Rs. 112.2 billion in 2019 mainly

due to the exemptions granted on the importation

of security equipment in May 2019 following the

Easter Sunday attacks. Revenue from Cess also

declined to Rs. 50.7 billion in 2019 from Rs. 53.4

billion in 2018 mainly due to the removal of Cess on

25 selected items with effect from 06 March 2019.

Revenue from NBT declined in nominal terms by

1.0 per cent to Rs. 70.7 billion reflecting mainly

the impact of the contraction in imports in 2019.

Accordingly, NBT revenue from import

related activities declined by 9.6 per cent

to Rs. 18.2 billion while revenue from

domestic economic activities increased by

2.4 per cent to Rs. 52.4 billion during the year.

However, as a percentage of GDP, revenue from

NBT remained unchanged at 0.5 per cent as in

the previous year. Further, revenue from Debt

Repayment Levy (DRL), which was introduced with

effect from 01 October 2018, increased to Rs. 28.7

billion in 2019 from Rs. 4.5 billion, in 2018 while

revenue from the Telecommunication Levy declined

by 35.5 per cent Rs. 18.3 billion during the year.

During 2019, non tax revenue declined both

in terms of GDP share and in nominal terms.

Accordingly, non tax revenue as a percentage

of GDP declined to 1.0 per cent in 2019 from

1.4 per cent in 2018. Similarly, in nominal

terms, non tax revenue declined significantly by

24.9 per cent to Rs. 156.0 billion in 2019 from

Rs. 207.7 billion in 2018 due to lower revenue from

fees and charges, non-availability of distributable

profits from the Central Bank and the reduction in

profit and dividend transfers from SOBEs. Although

upward revisions were made to certain fees and

charges in the Budget 2019, revenue from fees and

charges declined by 28.8 per cent to Rs. 72.0 billion

in 2019 due to the moderation in economic activity

followed by the Easter Sunday attacks. Meanwhile,

profit and dividend transfers from major SOBEs also

declined to Rs. 27.9 billion in 2019 from Rs. 41.8

billion in the previous year. Distributable profits

from the Central Bank were not available in 2019 in

comparison to the profit transfer of Rs. 15.0 billion

recorded in 2018. However, revenue from rent

and interest income increased by 35.1 per cent to

Rs. 18.5 billion in 2019 while revenue from social

security contributions increased by 15.0 per cent to

Rs. 29.0 billion during the year. Overall, the share of

non tax revenue in total revenue declined during the

year to 8.2 per cent from 10.8 per cent in 2018.

Grants

Total foreign grants received from bilateral

and multilateral sources declined to Rs. 7.9

billion in 2019 from Rs. 12.5 billion in 2018.

Foreign grants from bilateral sources declined by

41.2 per cent to Rs. 5.1 billion in 2019, while foreign

grants from multilateral sources declined by

27.2 per cent to Rs. 2.8 billion during the year. The

major development partners who provided grants

during the year were the Government of Japan, the

Government of India and the Asian Development

Bank (ADB).

Expenditure and Net Lending

Total expenditure and net lending as a

percentage of GDP increased to 19.4 per cent

in 2019 from 18.7 per cent in 2018 due to the

increase in recurrent expenditure despite the

FISCAL POLICY AND GOVERNMENT FINANCE

221

decline in public investment. Accordingly, recurrent

expenditure, as a percentage of GDP, increased to

15.3 per cent in 2019 from 14.5 per cent in 2018

while capital expenditure and net lending declined to

4.1 per cent in 2019 compared to 4.2 per cent in 2018.

Public investment, which includes capital expenditure

and on lending of the government, declined to

4.2 per cent of GDP in 2019 from 4.4 per cent of GDP

in 2018. However, in nominal terms, total expenditure

and net lending increased to Rs. 2,915.3 billion in

2019 from Rs. 2,693.2 billion in 2018.

During the year, recurrent expenditure

increased both in terms of GDP and in nominal

terms. Accordingly, recurrent expenditure, as a

percentage of GDP, increased to 15.3 per cent in

2019 from 14.5 per cent in 2018, while in nominal

terms, recurrent expenditure increased to Rs. 2,301.2

billion in 2019 from Rs. 2,089.7 billion in 2018. Higher

expenditure on subsidies and transfers, salaries and

wages and interest payments contributed to this

increase in recurrent expenditure.

In 2019, expenditure on interest payments increased both in terms of GDP and in

nominal terms. Accordingly, interest payments,

as a percentage of GDP, increased marginally to

6.0 per cent in 2019 from 5.9 per cent in 2018 while

in nominal terms, interest expenditure increased to

Rs. 901.4 billion in 2019 from Rs. 852.2 billion in

2018. Interest payments on domestic debt, which

increased by 2.1 per cent to Rs. 652.8 billion in

2019, accounted for 72.4 per cent of total interest

payments in 2019. Interest expenditure on Treasury

bonds declined by 1.3 per cent to Rs. 494.8 billion

in 2019 mainly due to the lower interest rates

that prevailed in the domestic market during the

year. Interest payments on Treasury bills rose by

8.7 per cent to Rs. 81.0 billion in 2019 from Rs. 74.5

billion in 2018 due to the increase in net issuance of

Treasury bills in 2019. In addition, interest payments

on Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) and

Rupee loans amounted to Rs. 35.4 billion and

Rs. 2.9 billion, respectively, in 2019. Interest

payments on foreign debt increased by

16.9 per cent to Rs. 248.6 billion in 2019 from

Rs. 212.7 billion in 2018 due to the rise in

foreign commercial borrowings during the year.

Interest payments continued to be the single

largest recurrent expenditure item, accounting for

39.2 per cent of total recurrent expenditure, and

equivalent to 47.7 per cent of the government

revenue in 2019.

During the year, expenditure on goods and services increased both in terms of GDP

share and in nominal terms. Accordingly, as a

percentage of GDP, expenditure on goods and

services increased to 6.0 per cent in 2019 from

5.6 per cent in 2018 while in nominal terms

expenditure on goods and services increased by

11.0 per cent to Rs. 894.4 billion in 2019. Salaries

and wages, the largest expenditure item in this

category, increased to 4.6 per cent of GDP in 2019

from 4.4 per cent of GDP in the previous year.

Similarly, in nominal terms, outlays on salaries and

wages increased to Rs. 686.5 billion in 2019 from

Rs. 626.0 billion in 2018. Salaries and wages paid to

central government employees, including defence

personnel, increased by 9.2 per cent to Rs. 506.5

billion, while the central government contribution

towards the salaries and wages of employees of

provincial councils increased by 11.0 per cent to

Rs. 180.0 billion during the year. The increase in

salaries and wages was mainly due to the inclusion

of an interim allowance on a progressive basis to

the basic salary with the implementation of the new

salary structure from January 2016 for public sector

employees and granting an interim allowance of

Rs. 2,500 per month to public sector employees

with effect from 01 July 2019 as proposed in the

Budget 2019. The share of salaries and wages in

total recurrent expenditure was 29.8 per cent in 2019

compared to 30.0 per cent in 2018, and this continued

to be the second largest recurrent expenditure item.

In nominal terms, expenditure on other goods and

services increased by 15.6 per cent to Rs. 207.9

billion while its relative share increased to 1.4 per cent

of GDP in 2019 from 1.3 per cent of GDP in 2018.

Expenditure on current transfers and

subsidies increased during the year both in

nominal terms and as a percentage of GDP

mainly due to the increase in current transfers

to the household sector. Accordingly, total

current transfers and subsidies, as a percentage

of GDP, increased to 3.4 per cent in 2019 from

3.0 per cent in 2018, while in nominal terms, current

transfers and subsidies increased by 17.1 per

cent to Rs. 505.4 billion in 2019. Current transfers

to households and other sectors accounted for

81.1 per cent of total current transfers, while

transfers to public institutions and public

corporations accounted for 15.0 per cent and

3.9 per cent, respectively, in 2019.

Current transfers to households, which

include pension payments, increased to

2.7 per cent of GDP in 2019 from 2.4 per cent of

GDP in 2018. In nominal terms, current transfers to

households increased to Rs. 410.1 billion in 2019

from Rs. 342.5 billion in 2018. Pension payments,

the single largest item in transfers to households,

increased by 17.1 per cent to Rs. 227.7 billion in

2019 mainly due to the impact of the rectification

of pension anomalies, effective from 01 July

2019, by incorporating the first two phases of the

Public Administration Circular No. 03/2016 to the

basic salary of pensioners as well as the rise in

the number of pensioners by 18,079 to 639,984

during the year. Meanwhile, expenditure on the

Samurdhi programme increased to Rs. 44.7 billion

in 2019 from Rs. 39.2 billion in 2018. Expenditure

on welfare programmes for disabled soldiers

increased by 10.8 per cent over the previous year

to Rs. 33.6 billion in 2019. Expenses incurred on

the fertiliser subsidy increased to Rs. 35.0 billion in

2019 from Rs. 26.9 billion in 2018.

As a percentage of GDP, current transfers

to public institutions increased while current

transfers to public corporations declined

during the year. Accordingly, current transfers to

public institutions increased to 0.5 per cent of GDP

in 2019 from 0.4 per cent of GDP in 2018, while

current transfers to public corporations declined

to 0.1 per cent of GDP from 0.2 per cent of GDP

recorded in the previous year. In nominal terms,

current transfers to public institutions increased

to Rs. 75.8 billion in 2019 from Rs. 61.6 billion in

2018 due to the increase in current transfers to

the education sector. Meanwhile, current transfers

to public corporations declined to Rs. 19.5 billion

in 2019 from Rs. 27.3 billion, mainly due to the

reduction in current transfers to the transport sector.

Transfers provided to cover operational losses

of the Department of Sri Lanka Railways and the

Department of Posts increased during the year to

Rs. 7.6 billion and Rs. 5.3 billion, respectively.

As a percentage of GDP, capital expenditure

and net lending declined in 2019 reflecting the

impact of prioritisation of capital expenditure

amidst the shortfall in government revenue.

Accordingly, as a percentage of GDP, capital

expenditure and net lending declined to

4.1 per cent in 2019 from 4.2 per cent in 2018.

However, in nominal terms, capital expenditure

and net lending increased to Rs. 614.1 billion

during the year from Rs. 603.5 billion in the

previous year. Meanwhile, public investment,

which includes capital expenditure and on lending

of the government, declined as a percentage of

GDP to 4.2 per cent in 2019 from 4.4 per cent in the

previous year. However, in nominal terms, public

Overview

Sri Lanka’s fiscal operations reflect a large structural budget deficit almost throughout the post-independence period amidst subdued revenue collection and growing government expenditure. In fact, government revenue is insufficient to cover even the expenses of a recurrent nature, resulting in a persistent deficit in the government current account (Figure B 10.1). In spite of this, government recurrent expenditure continues to increase, often at a faster pace than the growth of government revenue, worsening the fiscal position further. As recurrent expenditure rises continuously, capital expenditure tends to fall short of the estimates, adversely impacting long term growth prospects of the economy. Nevertheless, the rigidity in primary expenditure of the government (i.e., total expenditure net of interest payments) leaves a constant deficit in the primary balance, except in a few years in the post-independence budgetary operations of Sri Lanka. As the deficits in fiscal operations persisted and were continuously financed through borrowed funds, government debt accumulated over the years, raising concerns about debt sustainability in the period ahead. Unless managed prudently, the management of recurrent expenditure could be challenging in the years ahead, as the government debt stock remains large, and expenditure on interest payments would continue to rise. Other large expenditure categories in recurrent expenditure, such as salaries and wages, and pension payments would make significant pressures on fiscal operations, especially when more cadre is added to the public sector. Moreover, the non-funded pension scheme of the public sector along with an excessive social safety net programmes could exert pressure on fiscal operations, particularly in the backdrop of an increasingly ageing population in the country. Meanwhile, transfer payments to State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs) could escalate unless prudent measures are taken to address issues such as management inefficiencies and lack of cost-reflective tariff structures for their products and services. Further, the increased incidence of natural

BOX 10The Importance of Effective Management of Government Expenditure amidst Subdued Revenue Mobilisation

disasters could weigh heavily on expenditure management efforts of the government. While some efforts have been already taken to address these issues, continued focus on the progress of such efforts is essential for fiscal sustainability.

Government Expenditure: Budgeted vs Actual

Although the actual government expenditure remained below the budget estimates, the effectiveness of the management of government expenditure is called into question by the frequent submission of supplementary allocations1 in the recent years (Figure B 10.2).2 The government has raised supplementary allocations continuously for the past seven years and the major portion of them was on account of debt service payments.3 The submission of supplementary allocations to cover such mandatory expenses of the government does not augur well for prudent management of public expenditure. Such practice often demands a curtailment of expenditure from other areas, mostly capital expenditure, thereby affecting the country's growth prospects. Therefore, it is often argued that issues relating to fiscal operations of Sri Lanka are not only related to revenue shortfall; rather, they also represent the impact of sub optimal management of expenditure.

Management of Recurrent Expenditure

The rising share of mandatory fiscal expenses such as interest payments, salaries and wages, and pension payments continues to add pressure on fiscal operations, as these three sub components collectively utilised 96 percent of government revenue in 2019

1 Funds that are raised in addition to the budgeted expenditure for a particular year to fulfill the additional fund requirements of the government.2 Assuming that the funds raised through supplementary allocations were fully utilised during the year.3 As per the Performance Reports of the National Budget Department.

(Figure B 10.3). Meanwhile, expenditure on salaries and wages alone utilised about 36 per cent of government revenue in 2019. Moreover, expenditure on subsidies and transfers including pension payments, which has shown a rising trend in recent years, accounted for 26.7 per cent of government revenue in 2019. Such large expenditure on personal emoluments, and subsidies and transfers leave little room for the provision of other recurrent expenditure on social and economic services such as health, education, agriculture and irrigation, let alone resources required for capital expenditure.

Expenditure on Personal Emoluments

Expenditure on salaries and wages and pension payments has increased significantly over the years. The increase in public sector recruitments and upward revisions in salary and pension payments contributed to the increase in salaries and wages and pension payments by 11.4 per cent in 2019 over the previous year (Figure B 10.4). During the period 2010-2019, salaries and wages and pension payments, on average, accounted for around 45 per cent of government revenue. As Sri Lanka’s population is ageing faster and the size of the

government employment tends to be larger in spite of the unfunded pension scheme, fiscal burden on account of expenditure on salaries and wages and pension payments could rise significantly in the period ahead.

Expenditure on Subsidies and Transfers

The government spends about 3-4 per cent of GDP (equivalent to about 15 per cent of government revenue) on subsidy and transfer programmes. Although such subsidies are provided with the aim of uplifting the living standards of economically vulnerable groups, it is often observed that some of the subsidy and transfer programmes are ineffective in reducing poverty and inequality due to inefficiencies stemming from ill-targeting and a high level of leakages. For instance, although the Samurdhi programme is implemented with the objective of uplifting the living standards of vulnerable people in the society, it is often observed that the beneficiaries continue to remain in the programme for years, while ineligible persons could also enter the programme under the current selection process. With regard to the fertiliser subsidy programme, issues such as the overuse of subsidised fertliser hinder the effectiveness and sustainability of the programme while raising concerns over soil and water pollution and food safety of the country. Further, with an ageing population,

the country’s expenditure needs tend to increase in areas such as health, education and provision of social safety nets. Further, Sri Lanka experiences frequent natural hazards commonly caused by floods, landslides and droughts with increasing losses of life and property while causing additional pressure on the government budget. The recent spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the need for fiscal space to address such catastrophes as well as an improved system to disburse subsidies to affected businesses and individuals when required. Therefore, unplanned expenditure emanating from increased incidence of natural disasters on account

of costs incurred on compensation and mitigation measures could exacerbate pressure on managing public expenditure. Moreover, transfers to SOBEs could rise further in the period ahead unless appropriate measures are initiated to revive their weak financial performance on a sustainable basis and improve their financial strength.

Expenditure on Public Investment

The rising share of recurrent expenditure limits the space available for public investment (Figure B 10.6). However, curtailing public investment is counter-productive and will dampen economic growth over the medium to long term. A moderation in public investment, mainly

in the areas of economic and social infrastructure, was observed in the last decade or so (Figure B 10.7). Expenditure on economic infrastructure, the largest item in public investment, which includes agriculture and

irrigation, energy and water supply, and transport and communication reflects significant variations over the years with a general downward trend, while expenditure on social infrastructure that includes education, health, housing, and community services remains low. Maintaining such low levels of public investment in order to offset overruns in recurrent expenditure would hinder long term development prospects of the country.

Way Forward

Strengthening fiscal consolidation requires effective management of government expenditure while maintaining an appropriate balance between government revenue and economic growth. Expenditure management requires commitment to fiscal discipline and maintain the budget outturn in line with the annual budget estimate. In this regard, several aspects warrant special emphasis of the government including a well planned policy of recruitment to the public sector, thereby containing the rising expenditure on salaries and wages and pension liabilities. The introduction of a nationwide contributory pension scheme and a possible extension of the retirement age could be considered as alternatives. Meanwhile, the National Pay Commission, which was established in early 2020, could provide guidance and assistance to the government in formulating and executing a National Salaries Policy by revisiting the remuneration structures of the public and private sectors. Further, expenditure on subsidies and transfers could be rationalised by ensuring better targeting of safety net programmes while curtailing the unnecessary administrative expenses. In this regard, identifying the economically vulnerable segments of the society through a carefully designed methodology would help exclude unintended beneficiaries. Moreover, strengthening the monitoring process of SOBEs will enable the government to develop loss making SOBEs as profitable entities while enhancing the profitability of existing profit making entities, thereby reducing the burden on the central government budget. Further, ensuring effective adherence to the Statements of Corporate Intent (SCIs) signed by 13 SOBEs would enhance the effectiveness of SOBEs. Meanwhile, essential investment in physical infrastructure and human capital would need to continue in order to realise the envisaged growth in the medium to long term. In this regard, curtailing or postponing of planned public investment in priority areas need to be avoided while identifying alternative funding arrangements, such as Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) on a sustained basis.

the overall budget deficit as a percentage of GDP

increased to 6.8 per cent (Rs. 1,016.5 billion) in

2019 from 5.3 per cent (Rs. 760.8 billion) in the

previous year. The current account deficit, which

reflects dissavings of the government, expanded

to 2.7 per cent of GDP (Rs. 410.3 billion) in 2019

from 1.2 per cent of GDP (Rs. 169.7 billion) in 2018.

Meanwhile, the primary balance, which excludes

interest payments from the overall deficit and reflects

the discretionary component of fiscal policy, turned

to a deficit of 0.8 per cent of GDP (Rs. 115.1 billion)

compared to a surplus of 0.6 per cent of GDP

(Rs. 91.4 billion) in 2018, reversing the favourable

trend observed during the last two years.

Financing of the Budget Deficit

The government relied more on domestic

sources in financing the budget deficit in 2019.

Net financing through domestic sources accounted

for 4.7 per cent of GDP in 2019 in comparison to

3.0 per cent of GDP in 2018. Further, net domestic

financing contributed 69.1 per cent (Rs. 702.4

billion) of the total financing requirement in 2019

in comparison to 57.5 per cent (Rs. 437.2 billion)

in 2018. Accordingly, the share of net financing

through foreign sources declined significantly

to 30.9 per cent (Rs. 314.1 billion) in 2019 from

42.5 per cent (Rs. 323.5 billion) in 2018. Net

financing through foreign sources, as a percentage

of GDP, declined to 2.1 per cent in 2019 from

2.3 per cent in 2018.

In the composition of net domestic financing,

borrowing from non expansionary sources

increased and continued to be the largest in

2019. Accordingly, government borrowings from

the non banking sector increased significantly to

Rs. 509.3 billion, accounting for 72.5 per cent of

total net domestic financing in 2019, compared to

75.0 per cent (Rs. 327.8 billion) in 2018. Financing

from the banking sector amounted to Rs. 193.1

investment increased by 1.0 per cent to Rs. 631.2

billion in 2019. Expenditure incurred by Ministries

and Departments on the acquisition of real assets,

including the purchase of capital assets, and

construction and development of fixed assets,

increased by 8.2 per cent to Rs. 385.0 billion in

2019. Capital transfers declined by 8.8 per cent to

Rs. 234.1 billion due to the reduction in transfers

to public corporations. Meanwhile, on lending of

the government to public corporations amounted to

Rs. 12.2 billion in 2019, a decline of 2.0 per cent

from Rs. 12.4 billion recorded in 2018.

Public investment in economic services

increased, while public investments in social

services declined during the year. Accordingly,

public investment in economic services increased

to Rs. 475.9 billion in 2019 from Rs. 437.9 billion

in 2018 while public investment in social services

declined to Rs. 112.9 billion in 2019 from Rs. 133.2

billion in 2018. Public investment in economic

services was largely directed towards improving

the quality of the transport network of the country.

Public investment in social services focused mainly

on upgrading the quality of education and health

sectors. During the year, actions were taken to

improve the infrastructure of the education sector

with the aim of improving the quality of education

while public investment in the health sector focused

mainly on constructing and upgrading hospitals to

enhance the quality of service delivery in the health

sector.

Key Fiscal Balances

Key fiscal balances deteriorated in 2019,

amidst a notable decline in government revenue

resulted mainly from the impact of large

import compression, prolonged moderation of

economic activity that was exacerbated by the

Easter Sunday attacks, and the rise in recurrent

expenditure mainly on account of subsidies and

transfers and salaries and wages. Accordingly,

billion in 2019, representing 27.5 per cent of total

net domestic borrowings, compared to 25.0 per

cent (Rs. 109.5 billion) recorded in 2018. Financing

from the Central Bank recorded a net repayment of

Rs. 108.1 billion in 2019 compared to net financing of

Rs. 246.1 billion in 2018, mainly due to net repayment

in Treasury bills held by the Central Bank. However,

net borrowings through provisional advances from

the Central Bank increased to Rs. 38.0 billion in 2019

compared to a marginal net repayment of Rs. 1.2 billion

in 2018. Meanwhile, net financing from commercial

banks also increased significantly to Rs. 301.2

billion during 2019, compared to a net repayment of

Rs. 136.6 billion in 2018. An increase in Treasury bills

and Treasury bonds holdings of commercial banks

coupled with an increase in borrowings from Foreign

Currency Banking Units (FCBUs) mainly contributed

to the net increase in borrowings from the banking

sector in 2019.

Net financing from foreign sources declined

marginally in 2019 owing to the net repayments of

Foreign Currency Term Financing Facility (FCTFF)

and foreign investment in Treasury bonds despite

the notably high gross issuances of International

Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) during 2019. Accordingly,

net financing of the budget deficit through foreign

sources reduced to Rs. 314.1 billion in 2019 from Rs.

323.5 billion in 2018. Net borrowings through ISBs

increased to Rs. 461.4 billion (US dollars 2.6 billion)

during 2019, which is the difference between the new

issuances of Rs. 782.5 billion (US dollar 4.4 billion) and

repayment of Rs. 269.8 billion (US dollars 1.5 billion)

together with the unutilised balance of Rs. 51.4 billion

(US dollars 0.3 billion) at the end of 2019. In 2018,

net financing from ISBs amounted to Rs. 390.4

billion (US dollars 2.5 billion). Borrowings through

FCTFF recorded a net repayment of Rs. 83.5 billion

(US dollars 467.0 million) during 2019 in comparison

to the net borrowings of Rs. 66.6 billion (US dollars

372.5 million) in 2018. A net outflow of Rs. 59.3 billion

was recorded in respect of foreign holdings of Treasury

bonds, while net foreign investment in Treasury bills

amounted to Rs. 10.6 billion during the year. Foreign

project loans recorded a net repayment of Rs. 15.2

billion in 2019 compared to the net financing of

Rs. 7.7 billion in the previous year. On the basis of

gross financing, the Export-Import Bank of China

(Exim Bank), International Development Association

(IDA) and ADB were the main sources of financing in

2019, on account of foreign funded projects.

With regard to instrument-wise net domestic

financing, borrowings through Treasury bills and

Treasury bonds increased significantly, while

SLDB borrowings declined in 2019. Accordingly,

domestic instrument-based borrowings increased to

Rs. 502.8 billion in 2019 from Rs. 298.0 billion in 2018

due to higher borrowings through rupee denominated

government securities. Borrowings through Treasury

bonds increased to Rs. 429.0 billion in 2019 from

Rs. 374.5 billion in 2018, while borrowings through

Treasury bills increased to Rs. 123.8 billion in 2019

from Rs. 52.9 billion in 2018. However, borrowings

through SLDBs recorded a net repayment of Rs. 50.0

billion compared to a net repayment of Rs. 129.5 billion

in 2018. Meanwhile, non instrument borrowings also

increased to Rs. 199.6 billion in 2019 compared to

Rs. 139.2 billion in 2018 due to the increase in

borrowings through FCBUs and provisional advances

obtained from the Central Bank during the year,

amounting to Rs. 67.9 billion and Rs. 38.0 billion,

respectively.

Foreign currency denominated domestic

borrowings increased in 2019 mainly due to higher

borrowings from FCBUs. Accordingly, borrowings

through FCBUs increased, on a net basis, to Rs. 67.9

billion in 2019 from Rs. 19.1 billion recorded in 2018.

However, borrowings through SLDBs recorded a net

repayment of Rs. 50.0 billion in 2019, while gross

borrowings amounted to Rs. 61.9 billion (US dollars

345.2 million) and repayments amounted to Rs. 111.8

billion (US dollars 621.8 million). On a net basis,

foreign currency denominated domestic borrowings

increased to Rs. 18.0 billion in 2019 compared to

a net repayment of Rs. 110.4 billion in 2018, while

rupee denominated net domestic financing amounted

to Rs. 684.4 billion in 2019 compared to Rs. 547.6

billion in 2018.

The government raised US dollars 4.4 billion

through the issuance of ISBs twice during 2019.

The government issued its 13th ISB and raised

US dollars 2.4 billion in March 2019. This issuance

comprised two tenures of US dollars 1.0 billion with

a 5 year maturity at a yield of 6.85 per cent and

US dollars 1.4 billion with a 10 year maturity at a yield

of 7.85 per cent. In June 2019, ISBs amounting to

US dollars 2.0 billion were issued, which comprised

US dollars 500 million with a 5 year maturity at a yield

of 6.35 per cent and US dollars 1.5 billion with a long

10 year maturity at a yield of 7.55 per cent per annum.

6.4 Government Debt and Debt Service Payments

Central Government Debt

The central government debt to GDP ratio

increased to 86.8 per cent at end 2019 from

83.7 per cent at end 2018, reflecting the impact

of higher net borrowings to finance the enlarged

budget deficit, while the relatively low nominal

GDP also contributed to increase the debt

to GDP ratio. In absolute terms, the outstanding

central government debt increased by 8.3 per cent

(Rs. 1,001.0 billion) to Rs. 13,031.5 billion at end

2019 in comparison to the increase of 15.9 per cent

(Rs. 1,647.7 billion) recorded at end 2018. The share

of domestic and foreign debt as a percentage of GDP

rose to 44.1 per cent and 42.6 per cent, respectively,

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

230

6

at end 2019 from 42.3 per cent and 41.5 per cent,

respectively, at end 2018. Of the increase of the debt

stock, a sum of Rs. 93.6 billion can be attributed to

the discount factor, which is the net amount of the

difference between the book value and the face value

of issuances of Treasury bills and Treasury bonds in

2019. Meanwhile, the parity variation contributed to an

increase of Rs. 12.4 billion of the central government

debt stock in 2019 compared to the notable increase

of Rs. 1,063.2 billion in 2018.

The relative share of domestic debt in the

total outstanding debt rose marginally to

50.9 per cent at end 2019 from 50.5 per cent at

end 2018, reflecting the increased dependence

on domestic sources to finance the budget

deficit during the year. In nominal terms, domestic

debt increased by 9.2 per cent to Rs. 6,629.1

billion at end 2019 in comparison to the increase of

7.2 per cent in 2018. The share of short term debt

in total domestic debt increased to 19.2 per cent at

end 2019 from 18.7 per cent at end 2018, due to the

increase in the outstanding stock of Treasury bills

and provisional advances to the government by the

Central Bank. Outstanding Treasury bills increased

by 17.0 per cent to Rs. 873.9 billion by end 2019

from Rs. 746.9 billion at end 2018. Meanwhile,

the outstanding balance of provisional advances

increased by 19.1 per cent to Rs. 236.6 billion at end

2019 from Rs. 198.6 billion at end 2018. However,

the share of medium to long term debt in the domestic

debt stock declined marginally to 80.8 per cent as

at end 2019 from 81.3 per cent at end 2018. The

outstanding balance of Treasury bonds continued

to dominate the domestic debt portfolio, accounting

for 69.5 per cent (Rs. 4,606.2 billion) at end 2019 in

comparison to 69.1 per cent (Rs. 4,197.3 billion) at

end 2018. Meanwhile, outstanding stock of SLDBs

declined by 8.8 per cent to Rs. 560.2 billion at end

2019, while the outstanding balance of debt from

FCBUs rose to Rs. 168.0 billon at end 2019 from

Rs. 100.5 billion at end 2018.

The outstanding debt of the central

government owed to the domestic banking

sector increased by 16.5 per cent to Rs. 2,739.5

billion as at end 2019, reflecting a significant

increase in the outstanding debt held by both

the Central Bank and commercial banks. The

share of the banking sector debt in total domestic

debt increased to 41.3 per cent at end 2019 from

38.7 per cent at end 2018. The outstanding debt

owed to the Central Bank increased by 27.4 per

cent to Rs. 310.9 billion at end 2019, due to the

increase in provisional advances to the government

to Rs. 236.6 billion at end 2019 from Rs. 198.6

billion at end 2018. The government debt held by

commercial banks also increased by 15.2 per cent

to Rs. 2,428.7 billion at end 2019 compared to

end 2018 due to the increase of holdings of both

Treasury bills and Treasury bonds, and increase

in FCBU loans, despite the decline in outstanding

holdings of SLDBs to Rs. 560.2 billion at end 2019

from Rs. 614.2 billion at end 2018. The stock of

Treasury bills held by commercial banks increased

significantly by 40.0 per cent to Rs. 684.7 billion at

end 2019 from Rs. 489.2 billion at end 2018, while

the stock of Treasury bonds held by commercial banks

increased by 20.2 per cent to Rs. 839.5 billion at end

2019. Domestic debt held by the non bank sector

increased by 4.6 per cent to Rs. 3,889.4 billion by end

2019 from Rs. 3,719.1 billion at end 2018, reflecting

domestic debt (excluding the foreign holdings)

increased by Rs. 544.6 billion to Rs. 5,900.9 billion

at end 2019, mainly comprising Treasury bonds

amounting to Rs. 4,606.2 billion and Treasury bills

amounting to Rs. 873.9 billion.

The total outstanding foreign debt in rupee

terms increased by 7.4 per cent to Rs. 6,402.4

billion at end 2019, while the relative share of

foreign debt in the total debt stock declined

marginally to 49.1 per cent at end 2019 from

49.5 per cent at end 2018. The outstanding non

concessional debt increased by 11.7 per cent

to Rs. 3,635.0 billion in 2019, raising the share

of non concessional debt in total foreign debt to

an increase in financing from non bank sources in

2019, although the share of non bank sector debt in

total domestic debt declined to 58.7 per cent by end

2019 from 61.3 per cent at end 2018.

The foreign currency denominated

domestic debt increased to Rs. 728.2 billion

(US dollars 4,009.4 million) at end 2019

from Rs. 714.7 billion (US dollars 3,911.0

56.8 per cent at end 2019 from 54.6 per cent at end

2018. The increase in non concessional debt was

mainly due to further foreign commercial borrowings

during the year, which included the issuance of ISBs

(US dollars 4.4 billion) that raised the outstanding

stock of ISBs notably to Rs. 2,733.6 billion

(US dollars 15.1 billion) at end 2019. However, the

outstanding stock of FCTFFs declined to Rs. 242.2

billion at end 2019 due to a repayment of Rs. 83.5

billion (US dollars 467.0 million) during the year.

The outstanding balance of Treasury bonds held

by foreign investors declined by Rs. 66.6 billion to

Rs. 80.3 billion by end 2019, reflecting the impact

of outflows of foreign investment from the Treasury

bond market, especially during the second and

third quarters of 2019. The outstanding balance of

Treasury bills held by foreign investors, however,

increased by Rs. 11.8 billion to Rs. 23.7 billion at

end 2019. Meanwhile, the outstanding balance

of concessional debt in the stock of foreign debt

increased marginally by 2.3 per cent to Rs. 2,767.5

billion at end 2019 from Rs. 2,705.8 billion at end

2018 although the share of concessional debt in

foreign debt declined to 43.2 per cent at end 2019.

The rupee value of outstanding debt

increased by Rs. 12.4 billion due to the impact

of the exchange rate variation at end 2019.

The Sri Lankan rupee recorded an appreciation

against the euro, the Indian rupee, Special Drawing

Rights (SDR) and the US dollar by 2.62 per cent,

2.61 per cent, 0.93 per cent and 0.61 per cent,

respectively, while depreciating by 2.77 per cent

and 1.02 per cent, respectively, against the Pound

Sterling and the Japanese yen during the year. The

currency-wise composition of central government

foreign debt stood as US dollars (66.8 per cent), SDR

(14.5 per cent), Japanese yen (9.8 per cent),

euro (3.6 per cent) and other currencies

(5.4 per cent) at end 2019. Consequently, the

outstanding stock of foreign debt increased by

Rs. 16.9 billion, while the foreign currency

denominated domestic debt (SLDBs and loans from

FCBUs), which is denominated in US dollars, declined

by Rs. 4.5 billion due to the impact of exchange rate

variation at end 2019. As a comparison, in 2018,

the outstanding stock of foreign debt increased by

Rs. 963.2 billion mainly due to the depreciation of the

Sri Lankan rupee against major foreign currencies,

while the foreign currency denominated domestic

debt stock also increased by Rs. 100.0 billion due to

the depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee against the

US dollar. Although the impact of depreciation of the

Sri Lankan rupee would be reflected as an increase in

the government foreign currency debt stock in rupee

terms, the outstanding debt stock denominated in

foreign currency would remain unchanged in terms

of foreign currency, irrespective of such depreciation.

As the debt denominated in foreign currency would

be serviced using foreign currency inflows to the

government, the impact of such a nominal increase in

the outstanding balance due to the depreciation of the

rupee would be less material in the context of foreign

currency debt servicing.

Central Government Debt Service Payments

Total debt service payments in 2019

amounted to Rs. 2,022.5 billion, recording

a decline of 3.2 per cent in comparison to

in amortisation payments on domestic debt

during the year. Repayments of domestic debt

declined by 40.7 per cent to Rs. 546.3 billion in

2019 from Rs. 921.9 billion in 2018, mainly due to the

decline in SLDB maturities by 69.2 per cent (Rs. 251.7

billion) year-on-year, and the decline in maturities of

Treasury bonds and FCBUs by Rs. 82.8 billion and

Rs. 45.2 billion year-on-year, respectively. However,

repayments of foreign loans rose significantly by

82.8 per cent to Rs. 574.8 billion in 2019, reflecting

the maturity of ISBs of US dollar 1,500 million and

FCTFFs (US dollars 473 million). Consequently,

amortisation payments, which accounted for

55.4 per cent of total debt service payments,

declined by 9.3 per cent to Rs. 1,121.2 billion in

2019 from Rs. 1,236.4 billion in 2018. Meanwhile,

interest payments increased by 5.8 per cent to

Rs. 901.4 billion in 2019 from Rs. 852.2 billion

in 2018 due to the increase in interest payments

on both domestic and foreign outstanding debt.

Interest payments on foreign debt rose by

16.9 per cent (Rs. 35.8 billion) to Rs. 248.6 billion

in 2019 in comparison to Rs. 212.7 billion in 2018

mainly due to the increase in interest payments on

ISBs. Interest payments on domestic debt increased

by 2.1 per cent to Rs. 652.8 billion in 2019 from

Rs. 639.5 billion in 2018, mainly due to the

increase in interest payments on Treasury bills

and FCBU loans. Overall, domestic debt service

payments declined by 23.2 per cent to Rs. 1,199.1

billion, while foreign debt service payments rose by

56.2 per cent to Rs. 823.4 billion during 2019.

Most debt service payments related

indicators showed an improvement in

2019, while certain indicators such as

the ratio of debt service payments to

government revenue, remained a concern.

Total debt service payments declined to

13.5 per cent of GDP in 2019 from 14.5 per cent of

GDP in the previous year. Amortisation payments

on domestic debt as a percentage of GDP declined

to 3.6 per cent in 2019 from 6.4 per cent in 2018,

while amortisation payments on foreign debt

increased to 3.8 per cent of GDP in 2019 from

2.2 per cent of GDP in 2018. Total interest

payments as a percentage of GDP increased

marginally to 6.0 per cent in 2019 from

5.9 per cent in 2018. Interest payments on

domestic debt declined to 4.3 per cent of GDP

in 2019 from 4.5 per cent of GDP in 2018, while

interest payments on foreign debt increased to

1.7 per cent of GDP in 2019 from 1.5 per cent of

GDP in the previous year. Although the ratio of debt

service payments to government revenue improved

to 107.0 per cent in 2019 from 108.8 per cent in 2018,

the level of debt service payments in excess of the

level of government revenue remained a concern.

foreign project loans received by SOBEs8

and public guaranteed debt, increased to

8 Foreign project loans received by SOBEs without public guarantee

94.3 per cent of GDP at end 2019 from 91.7 per

cent of GDP at end 2018. This was mainly due to

an increase in central government debt during 2019.

same were approved by the Cabinet of Ministers

on 19 February 2020. Meanwhile, the FC initiated

a comprehensive, uniform planning system for

all the provinces in order to improve coordination

in the decision making process in national and

sub national government levels. In line with this,

the FC recommended establishing a common

framework for decision making in the national

and sub national governments. Moreover, the FC

made recommendations on providing adequate

funds for development activities under the

devolved subjects to be channelled through the

PCs, thereby to allocate resources effectively and

ensure transparency and accountability. Further,

considering the suboptimal distribution of ministries

in the PCs, the FC recommended designing the

portfolio of five ministries appropriately enabling

the PCs to function in an efficient and effective

manner while improving on the management,

coordination and compatibility among the PCs.

Moreover, highlighting the importance of enhancing

the revenue generation of PCs and reducing the

burden on the central government budget, the

FC made recommendations on the need to study

and explore avenues for the PCs to introduce new

revenue generating measures. In addition, the FC

recommended to introduce a contributory system

for expenditure in the health sector in particular,

in order to ease the burden on government

expenditure.

Budgetary Operations in Provincial Councils

The total revenue of PCs increased marginally

in nominal terms and remained unchanged as

a percentage of GDP in 2019 compared to the

previous year. Accordingly, total revenue of PCs

increased by 1.3 per cent to Rs. 89.8 billion in 2019

from Rs. 88.7 billion in 2018, reflecting the increase

in non tax revenue amidst the decline in tax revenue

in 2019. However, as a percentage of GDP, total

revenue remained unchanged at 0.6 per cent in

2019. Tax revenue declined to Rs. 81.1 billion in

2019 from Rs. 82.2 billion in 2018, reflecting a

decline in revenue collection from stamp duty.

Accordingly, revenue from stamp duty declined

by 4.5 per cent to Rs. 32.6 billion in 2019 from

Rs. 34.1 billion in 2018. Meanwhile, transfers of NBT

revenue from the central government increased

by 3.9 per cent to Rs. 35.3 billion in 2019 from

Rs. 33.9 billion in 2018. Revenue from the transfers

of NBT revenue and stamp duty from the central

government accounted for 43.5 per cent and

40.1 per cent of total tax revenue of PCs,

respectively. In nominal terms, non tax revenue

increased to Rs. 8.7 billion in 2019 in comparison to

Rs. 6.5 billion recorded in 2018 due to the increase

in revenue collection from fees and charges, which

accounts for around 75 per cent of total non tax

revenue of PCs. The share of revenue of the

Western Provincial Council of the total revenue

collection by all PCs declined to 48.3 per cent in

2019 from 51.4 per cent in 2018. Of the revenue

collection by the other PCs, the North Western

and Southern provinces accounted for 9.7 per cent

and 9.4 per cent of the total revenue, respectively.

Meanwhile, the share of revenue collected from the

Sabaragamuwa province increased to 5.1 per cent

in 2019 from 4.4 per cent in 2018.

During the year, recurrent expenditure of

PCs increased in nominal terms, while in GDP

terms it remained unchanged. Accordingly, in

nominal terms, recurrent expenditure increased by

9.8 per cent to Rs. 276.2 billion in 2019 mainly due

to higher expenditure on personal emoluments.

However, as a percentage of GDP, recurrent

expenditure remained unchanged at 1.8 per cent in

2019. During 2019, personal emoluments amounted

to Rs. 216.5 billion, recording an increase of

9.3 per cent and continued to be the single largest

item in the recurrent expenditure accounting for

78.4 per cent of the total recurrent expenditure of

PCs. The education and health sectors absorbed

FISCAL POLICY AND GOVERNMENT FINANCE

237

around 90 per cent of the personal emoluments of

PCs. The functional basis, recurrent expenditure on

social services increased to Rs. 204.0 billion, while

recurrent expenditure on provincial administration

and economic services declined to Rs. 16.3 billion

and Rs. 4.1 billion, respectively. Among the high

spending PCs in 2019, the Western, the Central

and the North-Western provinces accounted for

21.3 per cent, 12.5 per cent and 11.8 per cent of

total recurrent expenditure of PCs, respectively.

In 2019, capital expenditure of PCs declined

both in nominal terms and as a percentage of

GDP reflecting the decline in all subsectors

of capital expenditure. Accordingly, capital

expenditure declined to Rs. 32.4 billion in 2019

from Rs. 40.7 billion in 2018, of which expenditure

on acquisition of capital goods declined to

Rs. 11.8 billion in 2019 from Rs. 14.3 billion

in 2018. In addition, expenditure on Province

Specific Development Projects (PSDP), capital

transfers to local governments and special projects

also declined during the year. Meanwhile, as a

percentage of GDP, capital expenditure declined

marginally to 0.2 per cent in 2019 from 0.3 per cent

in 2018.

Transfers from the central government to

PCs increased during the year both in terms

of GDP share and in nominal terms. The central

government transfers increased to Rs. 218.8

billion in 2019 from Rs. 203.6 billion in 2018 due

to the increase in block grants amidst the decline

in grants for special projects, Province Specific

Development Grants (PSDGs) and Criteria Based

Grants (CBGs). As a percentage of GDP, the

transfers from the central government increased to

1.5 per cent in 2019 from 1.4 per cent recorded

in 2018. Block grants, the major form of central

government transfers to PCs, amounted to

Rs. 200.0 billion, representing 91.4 per cent of

the total transfers, which were provided to meet

the resource gap in the recurrent expenditure

programme of PCs. The transfers under PSDGs,

grants for special projects and CBGs amounted

to Rs. 11.4 billion, Rs. 5.2 billion and Rs. 2.2

billion, respectively. During the year, a share of

70.9 per cent of the expenditure of PCs was

financed through central government transfers

reflecting the need to enhance the revenue

collection of PCs, thereby to ease the burden on

the central government budget.
