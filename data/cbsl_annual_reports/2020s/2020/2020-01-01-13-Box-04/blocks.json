    "text": "Global demand for food is growing continuously as a result of population growth and dietary changes, and as per the World Population Prospects - 2019 of the United Nations, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050 from today\u2019s 7.8 billion level. Rise in population brings a range of global sustainability issues, including food security. Sri Lanka, as a developing nation, faces similar concerns about food security amidst growing population, substantial postharvest losses and regular adverse weather shocks, and these challenges need to be tackled through efficient agriculture practices. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has also reiterated the importance of food security for a developing nation such as ours. Traditional agriculture, through the accumulation of farmers\u2019 knowledge and experiences, managed to feed the entire population for many centuries in the past. The cascade tank-village system (Ellanga system), the hill side cascade paddy fields (Helmalu) and the irrigation systems developed in the historical past were remarkable agro-biodiversity systems in Sri Lanka with regard to water management efficiency, climate change adaptability and buffers against natural disasters such as floods, droughts and pest attacks. However, during the colonial period, priority was given to plantation agriculture and little attention was paid to other crop cultivations, except for subsistence farming. With little government attention, subsistence farming alone became insufficient to meet the growing food demand in the country. Subsequently, the green revolution, which was a major policy response of many developing nations in the 1960s, sought to increase the efficiency of agricultural processes through various techniques such as high yielding robust varieties, hybridised seeds, expansion of irrigation infrastructure, synthetic fertiliser, and pesticides. Although the agriculture sector has undergone considerable transformation and improvements in response to green revolution practices, productivity levels have been stagnant in recent years, raising concerns about food security as well as low farmer income. However, reverting back to the agro-ecosystem that is based on traditional agriculture practices is not feasible under the current context, since available resources for agriculture activities such as land and water resources have been diminishing rapidly owing to other industrial activities and urbanisation. Despite a significant share of the labour force employed in the sector, labour shortages have been increasingly common in relation to labour intensive cultivation activities. In addition, recent experiences of erratic weather patterns and resultant natural disasters, such as droughts and floods, tend to impose additional restrictions on agricultural activities. These trends emphasise the importance of improving productivity and efficient resource usage in the agriculture sector through innovative technologies.",

For instance, a moisture sensor and irrigation system augmented with AI can determine the exact water requirement of a crop based on soil moisture level, stage of crop cultivation as well as weather forecasts, and enable the irrigation of the field accordingly without human intervention. For instance, in Nigeria, the Hello Tractor IoT service connects tractor owners who wish to hire their tractor with farmers, with the aim of sharing resources and fully utilising available tractors. Moreover, food supply chain inefficiencies indicate a disconnection between supplier and retailer in the sector. Blockchain technology creates a direct link between all participants in the supply chain, ensuring efficiency, traceability and transparency at each stage of the production process. For example, the government of Thailand has introduced a pilot project to use blockchain traceability solutions for organic rice, particularly to track and trace Thailand\u2019s jasmine rice from production to export. In the sequence of technological developments, drones and automated robots have emerged as versatile technologies for smart farming activities. Drone technology is used for soil and field analysis, planting, crop spraying, crop monitoring and analysis, irrigation, and crop health assessments. Hence, drone technology facilitates time saving in cultivation activities, reduces usage of scarce human and other resources, stores data for future analysis and increases yields by effective resource usage. Farmers of Andhra Pradesh in India, for instance, have commenced using drones to spray their farms with required pesticides. Further, private tech companies in India use drones to offer agriculture survey services to insurance companies as well as the government to efficiently implement crop insurance schemes. In addition, advanced robotic systems, such as weeding robots, driverless tractors and soil sterilisation robots, are used in agriculture fields for supplying inputs, land preparation, weed control, pruning, seeding, spraying, thinning, harvesting and picking, and sorting and packing. Therefore, drone and robot technologies support farmers for efficient resource management while reducing cost of production through reduced labour usage.",

Hence, postharvest technologies play a critical role in maintaining the quality of food, extending the shelf life of perishables and reducing food losses. Postharvest loss management requires careful handling of goods from the time of harvest until they reach the market. In addition to cold storage, numerous postharvest technologies such as chemical treatments (applying antioxidants, anti-browning and antimicrobial chemicals) and physical treatments (radiation, heat and edible coatings) are regularly used in food supply chains. The purpose of these technologies is to slow down food quality deterioration due to physiological processes and maturation while minimising the risk of microbial growth and contamination. In addition to the application of postharvest treatments, improved packaging techniques also help to reduce postharvest losses at different stages of the food value chain such as storage and transportation. Active packaging that incorporates oxygen and ethylene absorbers will slow down physiological processes in food, thereby extending their shelf life. Meanwhile, intelligent packaging that incorporates sensors, indicators and radio frequency identification systems are increasingly used in monitoring food quality and package integrity. Further, genetic experts have developed plant strains that are resistant to some of the postharvest changes.",

Farmers and related stakeholders require the latest information on the most effective planting practices, best prices in the markets, available credit supply, soil conditions, nutrients and plant protection. Moreover, early warnings on drought and flood conditions, pest and disease outbreaks, and forest fire are sought by farmers on a frequent basis. Electronic extension programmes can be used to disseminate such information and alerts to stakeholders through digital technologies. Instead of always physically contacting the farmers, extension agents could use a combination of voice, text, videos, and internet methods to contact farmers frequently in a more cost effective manner given the increasing mobile phone usage by farmers. For example, the AgroStar tech platform in India offers a wide range of agronomy advice coupled with agricultural inputs and services to farmers to increase their productivity and quality of produce while solving common problems occurring in farming activities. Currently, AgroStar operates in the Indian states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan, linking over 500,000 farmers on its digital platform.

However, further progress towards technology-oriented agriculture, with the aim of enhancing agricultural value chains, is crucial for the next level of development and to tackle emerging challenges in the agriculture sector. Identifying sectoral and grassroots level limitations of technology adoption will help mitigate constraints in transformation from conventional practices to tech-based agriculture. Policy reforms on capital allocation for technology transformation and technical education as well as strengthening digital infrastructure are important, thereby addressing persistent structural obstacles that deter technological adoption in the sector. Increased public investment in research and development activities through the numerous agriculture related research organisations in the country for data-driven, smart tech-based agriculture practices and creating a conducive investment environment for the private sector to invest in such activities, and increased access to credit at concessional rates are vital to boost technology innovations in the agriculture sector. In addition, increasing awareness on available services and enhancing access to concessional loans to support farmer level investments are also critical to address constraints for technological adoption at the grassroots level. In the medium to long run, introducing subjects related to advanced agriculture technologies to curricula of technical and tertiary education programmes is also essential to promote technology adoption in the agriculture sector.
