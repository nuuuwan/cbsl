7.1 OverviewW

ith the view to reviving subpar

economic activity and weak growth of

credit to the private sector, the Central

Bank adopted an accommodative monetary policy

in May 2019 and reinforced it in August 2019

and early 2020, supported by muted inflation,

well-anchored inflation expectations, a relatively

stable external sector and increasingly easing

monetary policy globally. The reduction of the

policy interest rates by the Central Bank in May and

August 2019 following forward guidance provided

to the market in April 2019, was intended to reduce

market lending rates and boost credit flows to the

private sector. This was in addition to the reduction

of the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) on all rupee

deposit liabilities of Licensed Commercial Banks

(LCBs) by 1.00 percentage point with effective from

01 March 2019. To facilitate a faster reduction in

market lending rates by reducing the cost of funds

of financial institutions, the Central Bank imposed

ceilings on interest rates of deposit products of

financial institutions in April 2019, while maintaining

adequate levels of liquidity in the domestic money

market. In response to deposit caps, deposit

interest rates and yields on government securities

displayed a notable reduction. Yet, lending rates

remained downward rigid, and as a temporary

measure, the Central Bank imposed ceilings on

lending rates of licensed banks in September 2019

aimed at inducing a sizable reduction in market

lending rates, while removing caps on deposit

rates of licensed banks. Consequently, market

lending rates started to decline gradually and the

credit disbursed by LCBs to the private sector

started accelerating in absolute terms towards the

latter part of 2019. However, as new deposit rates

started to rise following the removal of deposit

caps, the Central Bank lowered policy rates further

by 50 basis points in January 2020, considering

the need for a continued reduction in market

lending rates to support the envisaged recovery in

economic activity. Meanwhile, with the aggravation

of the COVID-19 outbreak both globally and

domestically, it became evident by March 2020 that

domestic economic and financial market activity

could be further affected through various channels.

Accordingly, the Central Bank, in an emergency

move, reduced the Standing Deposit Facility Rate

(SDFR) and the Standing Lending facility Rate

(SLFR) by a further 25 basis points with effect

from 17 March 2020 while reducing the SRR on all

rupee deposit liabilities of LCBs by 1.00 percentage

point to 4.00 per cent, with effect from the reserve

maintenance period commencing 16 March 2020,

in addition to taking steps to inject large amounts

of liquidity to the domestic market through various

operational measures. A further reduction in policy

interest rates by 25 basis points was effected from

the close of business on 03 April 2020. The overall

reduction in policy interest rates during the period

from 31 May 2019 to 03 April 2020 amounted to

200 basis points, resulting in the SDFR and the

SLFR to remain at 6.00 per cent and 7.00 per cent,

respectively, as at the close of business on 03 April

2020.

Reflecting subdued economic activity during the

year and weak business confidence that prevailed

during early 2019, growth of credit extended to

the private sector decelerated significantly in 2019

compared to 2018, in spite of the recovery in

absolute credit disbursements towards the end of

2019. Meanwhile, the reliance of the government

on the banking system also moderated in 2019

compared to 2018 with the availability of foreign

funds through the issuance of International

Sovereign Bonds (ISBs), as well as increased

financing from the non banking sector. Reflecting

these developments, the year-on-year growth of

broad money (M2b) decelerated to 7.0 per cent by

end 2019 in comparison to 13.0 per cent by end

2018.

Meanwhile, consumer price inflation remained

broadly in low levels during 2019 reflecting

the persistent negative output gap caused by

subdued demand conditions along with well

anchored inflation expectations. However, inflation

accelerated in early 2020 with domestic supply side

disruptions causing high food inflation. Projections

indicate that inflation is likely to remain within the

desired 4-6 per cent range in the medium term

underpinned by appropriate policy measures

aimed at maintaining low and stable inflation, while

supporting the revival of economic activity under

flexible inflation targeting.

7.2 Monetary Policy Stance of the

Central Bank of Sri Lanka

The Central Bank adopted an

accommodative monetary policy stance in 2019

amidst prolonged subpar economic activity

exacerbated by Easter Sunday attacks, muted

inflation, favourable inflation outlook, rapidly

decelerating private sector credit growth, and

increasingly easing monetary policy globally.

Prior to shifting to an accommodative policy stance,

the Central Bank provided forward guidance to the

market in April 2019 on the likelihood of a reduction

of policy interest rates to address the rapid

deceleration of private sector credit growth and

below potential economic growth. The SDFR and

the SLFR of the Central Bank were then reduced

by 50 basis points each to 7.50 per cent and 8.50

per cent, respectively, in May 2019, thus ending the

neutral monetary policy stance maintained since

April 2018. Meanwhile, the Central Bank reduced

the SRR applicable on all rupee deposit liabilities of

LCBs by a further 1.00 percentage point in March

2019 with a view to addressing the persistent deficit

levels in the domestic money market, following

which liquidity turned into surplus levels from mid

April 2019. Despite improved liquidity, market

interest rates remained downward rigid. As such,

considering the need to expedite the monetary

policy transmission through the financial system,

the Central Bank was compelled to impose interest

rate ceilings on deposit products of licensed banks

and non bank financial institutions with effect from

26 April 2019, as high interest rates offered on

deposits were viewed as one major cause for the

high cost of funds in the financial sector. With this

measure, market deposit rates started to reduce

notably, while market lending rates remained slow

to adjust. With a view to inducing a sizable reduction

in market lending rates, the Central Bank reduced

the SDFR and the SLFR further by 50 basis points

to 7.00 per cent and 8.00 per cent, respectively,

effective 23 August 2019. Moreover, the overly

persistent delay in the transmission of policy

measures to market lending rates necessitated

the Central Bank to order licensed banks to

reduce lending rates on 24 September 2019, while

withdrawing the caps on deposit interest rates

offered by licensed banks. Supported by monetary

policy, operational and regulatory measures

taken by the Central Bank, market lending rates

showed a gradual downward movement during the

remainder of the year. Meanwhile, with the removal

of caps on deposit interest rates offered by banks,

new deposit rates increased during September

through December 2019, while yields on Treasury

bills also trended upwards towards end 2019 and

in January 2020. Considering the need to signal

the expectation of a continued reduction in market

lending rates to support the revival of economic

activity in the context of the favourable inflation

outlook and well contained inflation expectations,

the Central Bank reduced the SDFR and the SLFR

further by 50 basis points to 6.50 per cent and

7.50 per cent, respectively, effective 30 January

2020. Meanwhile, considering the urgent need to

support economic activity and the financial sector

with the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic

and its possible further spread in Sri Lanka, at

an emergency meeting to review the monetary

policy stance on 16 March 2020, the Central Bank

reduced the SDFR and the SLFR of the Central

Bank by 25 basis points to 6.25 per cent and 7.25

per cent, respectively, with effect from 17 March

2020. At the same time, in order to enable LCBs to

execute their financial transactions smoothly and

reduce their cost of funds further, the Central Bank

reduced SRR on all rupee deposit liabilities of LCBs

by 1.00 percentage point to 4.00 per cent, effective

from the reserve maintenance period commencing

16 March 2020, thus providing additional liquidity of

around Rs. 65 billion to the domestic money market.

The SDFR and the SLFR of the Central Bank were

further reduced by 25 basis points to 6.00 per cent

and 7.00 per cent, respectively, effective from the

close of business on 03 April 2020, and this decision

is expected to complement the measures that have

been taken thus far to ease market conditions, and

enable the domestic financial market to provide

further relief to businesses and individuals affected

by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and

restrictions placed to contain its spread within the

country.

Supporting the adoption and maintenance

of an accommodative monetary policy stance

by the Central Bank, consumer price inflation

broadly remained low during 2019, reflecting

subdued demand conditions along with well

anchored inflation expectations. Headline

inflation, as measured by the year-on-year change

in the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI,

2013=100) was largely stable around mid single digit

levels in 2019, while the National Consumer Price

Index (NCPI, 2013=100) based headline inflation

remained low during the year, before recording a

supply driven uptick in December 2019. Headline

inflation, as measured by the year-on-year change

in the CCPI, which was at 2.8 per cent in December

2018, accelerated towards the mid single digit level

by May 2019. Some softening of inflation was

experienced during June through August 2019

due to the deceleration of both food and non food

inflation. However, inflation accelerated thereafter

and hovered around 5.0 per cent levels amidst

disruptions in the domestic food supplies due to

adverse weather conditions. Accordingly, year-

on-year headline inflation based on the CCPI was

recorded at 4.8 per cent by end 2019. Driven by food

inflation, CCPI based headline inflation accelerated

in the first two months in 2020 to record 6.2 per

cent in February 2020, before decelerating to 5.4

per cent in March 2020 as food inflation eased with

improved domestic supplies. On an annual average

basis, CCPI based headline inflation remained

unchanged at 4.3 per cent at end 2019 compared

to end 2018. Year-on-year headline inflation based

on the NCPI, which attaches a higher weight on

food than the CCPI, accelerated to 6.2 per cent

by December 2019, compared to 0.4 per cent in

December 2018, and accelerated further to 8.1

per cent by February 2020, due to increased food

prices. Meanwhile, NCPI based annual average

inflation accelerated to 3.5 per cent by end 2019

from 2.1 per cent at end 2018. As per the Inflation

Expectations Survey of the Central Bank, inflation

expectations of the corporate sector remained

broadly in the mid single digit range during 2019,

while inflation expectations of the household sector

remained high, particularly during the second

quarter of 2019. During 2019, CCPI based inflation

remained within the inner band of the quantitative

performance criteria under the IMF-Extended Fund

Facility (EFF) Programme. Inflation is expected to

be maintained in mid single digit levels over the

medium term supported by adequate and timely

policy measures, although short term fluctuations

in inflation due to supply side factors need to be

managed through appropriate policy adjustments

by the government.

Core inflation, which reflects the underlying

trend in inflation and hence more useful for

monetary policy purposes, remained broadly

stable in 2019 following an elevation in

January 2019 due to the upward adjustments

to the prices of certain items in the non food

category. Adjustments to house rentals and

expenses on education, upward revisions in

taxes on alcoholic beverages and tobacco, and

an increase in administratively determined prices

mainly contributed to the elevation of core inflation

in January 2019. In addition, increases in prices

across the health category and commodity prices

alongside the lagged effect of the depreciation of

the Sri Lankan rupee in 2018 resulted in a modest

rise in year-on-year core inflation towards May

2019. However, CCPI based year-on-year core

inflation decelerated gradually from June 2019

onwards, and registered 4.8 per cent in December

2019, compared to 3.1 per cent in December 2018.

CCPI based annual average core inflation reached

5.5 per cent by end 2019, compared to 3.5 per

cent recorded at end 2018. NCPI based year-on-

year core inflation, which recorded 3.1 per cent

at end 2018, rose to 6.3 per cent by April 2019,

before decelerating thereafter. Declining non food

prices mainly aided NCPI based core inflation to

decelerate to 5.2 per cent by end 2019. Meanwhile,

annual average core inflation, based on NCPI,

accelerated to 5.7 per cent at end 2019 from 2.4

per cent recorded at end 2018. However, with the

dissipation of one off adjustments that were made

at the beginning of 2019, core inflation based on

both CCPI and NCPI decelerated sharply in the first

quarter of 2020. Accordingly, CCPI based year-on-

year core inflation moderated to 2.9 per cent by

March 2020 and NCPI based core inflation declined

to 3.4 per cent in February 2020, also supported

by the decline in prices in the telecommunication

and data services category following the downward

revision of the telecommunication levy effective

from December 2019.

The accommodative monetary policy stance

was also aimed at ensuring the availability

of sufficient money and credit flows to the

economy. The year-on-year growth of broad

money supply (M2b) and credit to the private

sector continued to decelerate during the year,

although some recovery was observed towards

the end of 2019 supported by the accommodative

monetary policy stance of the Central Bank. The

deceleration in broad money growth can entirely

be attributed to the moderation of net domestic

assets (NDA) of the banking sector on account

of the slowdown in credit extended to the private

sector during the year amidst high market lending

rates and subdued economic activity. Meanwhile,

credit obtained by the government as well as

State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs)

from the banking system increased during 2019,

albeit at a slower pace compared to 2018. With

the increased reserve accumulation by the Central

Bank as well as LCBs, net foreign assets (NFA)

of the banking system returned to positive levels

in 2019. Considering the significantly low demand

for credit by the private sector and the risk-averse

nature of credit supply by banks, the government

initiated several measures during 2019 and in

early 2020, which are complementary to monetary

easing measures of the Central Bank, thereby

supporting credit flows to the private sector and

the overall economic activity. Accordingly, in

support of the recovery of the tourism industry in

the aftermath of the Easter Sunday attacks, a debt

moratorium was announced for tourism related

industries to be effective until 31 March 2020. In

addition, a special credit support scheme for small

and medium enterprises (SMEs) was introduced

in January 2020 with a view to facilitating a broad

based recovery in activity along with the support

of fiscal incentives announced by the government.

Under this scheme, borrowers of the SME sector

could request a grace period for repayment of

capital payments, while non performing loans

(NPLs) could also be considered for availing

concessions. The outbreak of the COVID-19

pandemic necessitated further decisive measures

to be adopted by the government, the Central Bank

and the financial sector, and accordingly, a series

of measures was introduced to support the sectors

and persons affected by the ongoing disruptions to

economic activity.

The Central Bank conducted monetary

policy in line with a flexible inflation targeting

framework, aimed at stabilising inflation at

mid single digit levels over the medium term

while supporting economic growth to reach its

potential level. Under this framework, monetary

policy is formulated in a forward looking manner,

backed by data driven analyses with the support of

the model based Forecasting and Policy Analysis

System (FPAS). The operational target of the

current framework, namely, the Average Weighted

Call Money Rate (AWCMR), is guided by policy

interest rates, consistent with the objective of

maintaining inflation within 4-6 per cent. Modelling

and forecasting capacity, internal decision

making process and external monetary policy

communication are continuously being improved in

line with the flexible inflation targeting framework.

The unprecedented developments arising from the

spread of the COVID-19 pandemic could cause

the Central Bank to take extraordinary measures

to mitigate the effect of the pandemic on the Sri

Lankan economy and the financial sector in the

short run, but is not envisaged to affect the Central

Bank’s ability to maintain mid single digit level of

inflation in the medium term, thereby supporting

sustained economic growth.

The Central Bank strengthened monetary

policy communication further with a view to

enhancing transparency and accountability of

the decision making process and improving

the effectiveness of monetary policy actions.

The content of the press release on the Monetary

Policy Review was further improved, enhancing

clarity and transparency of monetary policy

decisions. In addition, the Central Bank began

publishing its explicit inflation projections by way of

a fan chart covering a 3-year horizon on a quarterly

basis commencing January 2020. The publication

of medium term inflation projections is expected

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

246

to firmly anchor inflation expectations, while also

helping the public to assess performance of the

Central Bank. Meanwhile, the livestreaming of the

press conference on the review of the monetary

policy stance was commenced in November 2019,

thus providing real time access to a wider audience.

Further, the Central Bank conducted several

awareness programmes on the improvements

to the monetary policy framework for targeted

audiences. Information on key macroeconomic

developments was regularly published through

the publications of the Central Bank, including

the Annual Report, the Recent Economic

Developments Report, while web publications of

macroeconomic statistics continued on a daily,

weekly, monthly and quarterly bases. Moreover,

the Central Bank communicated its policy decisions

and expected developments to the public via other

modes of communication such as information

notes, bulletins and other publications, seminars,

meetings, lectures and speeches, which helped

enhance the transparency and accountability of

the monetary policy process.

7.3 Movements in Interest Rates

Market Liquidity and Short Term Interest Rates

Rupee liquidity in the domestic money

market, which was in deficit since September

2018, improved gradually to record surplus

levels by mid April 2019, mainly reflecting the

impact of monetary policy and operational

measures implemented from the last quarter

of 2018. Money market liquidity remained in deficit

at the beginning of 2019, despite the permanent

liquidity injection through the reduction in the

SRR applicable on all rupee deposit liabilities of

commercial banks by 1.50 percentage points to

6.00 per cent with effect from mid November 2018.

The Central Bank continued to conduct overnight,

short term and long term reverse repurchase

transactions as well as outright purchases of

Treasury bills to inject liquidity to the market,

thereby easing pressure on overnight interest

rates. However, as deficit liquidity conditions

persisted, the Central Bank reduced the SRR by a

further 1.00 percentage point to 5.00 per cent with

effect from 01 March 2019. The SRR reductions

in November 2018 and March 2019 added around

Rs. 150 billion of liquidity to the domestic money

market on a permanent basis. Meanwhile, market

liquidity improved further with the purchases of

Treasury bills by the Central Bank in the primary

market in January 2019 in view of the disruptions

to the government borrowing programme due to

the political impasse during the fourth quarter of

2018, and the conversions of proceeds from the

ISBs by the government. With these injections and

the continuous return of currency after the festive

season, liquidity conditions in the domestic money

market improved to record a surplus by mid April

2019. Further increase in money market liquidity

with the foreign currency purchases by the Central

Bank from the domestic foreign exchange market

required the Central Bank to mop up excess

liquidity by carrying out Open Market Operations

(OMOs) comprising overnight, short term and

long term repurchase transactions during the

period from May through July 2019 to maintain

the AWCMR around the middle of the policy rate

corridor. However, liquidity distribution amongst

banks remained uneven at times, compelling

the Central Bank to conduct reverse repurchase

transactions on overnight and short term bases, in

addition to several outright purchases of Treasury

impact of asymmetric liquidity distribution, while

levels, reflecting the impact of maturing Treasury

bill holdings of the Central Bank, early retirement

of Treasury bills, maturing of swaps and scheduled

foreign loan repayments as well as sales of foreign

exchange to prevent disorderly adjustments in

the exchange rate. Meanwhile, the Central Bank

extended its outright transactions to include

Treasury bonds with effect from September 2019,

considering the projections of sustained liquidity

deficits in the money market. Accordingly, Central

Bank purchases of Treasury bonds on an outright

basis during 2019 added Rs. 47.7 billion of long

term liquidity to the market. Subsequently, money

market liquidity turned into surplus levels by mid

September 2019, and overnight liquidity surplus

stood at Rs. 37.9 billion by end 2019. Further, a

Liquidity Support Facility (LSF) for Standalone

Primary Dealers for government securities was

introduced with effect from 06 September 2019,

as access to OMO auctions by standalone primary

dealers was restricted in 2018. Meanwhile, to

prevent disruptions to economic activity and the

possible financial market stress due to the spread

of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Central Bank took

measures to further enhance liquidity conditions in

the market through monetary policy and operational

measures in the first quarter of 2020.

The overnight interbank AWCMR, which

remained around the upper bound of the policy

rate corridor since September 2018 due to

deficit liquidity conditions, started to decline

gradually from March 2019 and remained

around the middle of the policy rate corridor

thereafter, as liquidity conditions improved in

line with the accommodative monetary policy

stance of the Central Bank. Reflecting the deficit

liquidity conditions in the domestic money market,

the AWCMR remained mostly around the upper

bound of the policy rate corridor during the period

from September 2018 to February 2019. With the

reduction in the SRR effective from March 2019,

liquidity conditions improved and the AWCMR

adjusted downward towards the middle of the

policy rate corridor. Following the reduction in

policy interest rates by 50 basis points by end May

2019, the AWCMR also declined and remained

mostly below the middle of the policy rate corridor

until August 2019. The AWCMR declined further as

policy interest rates were reduced further by 50 basis

points in August 2019, while OMOs were carried out

to maintain the AWCMR around the middle of the

policy rate corridor. The AWCMR declined by 150

basis points to 7.45 per cent by end 2019 from 8.95

per cent at end 2018. The weighted average yields

at daily OMO reverse repurchase auctions also

decreased to 7.50 per cent by end 2019 from 8.98

per cent at end 2018, while weighted average yields

at daily OMO repurchase auctions also declined in

line with policy rate reductions in 2019. Meanwhile,

the Sri Lanka Interbank Offered Rates (SLIBOR)

also declined during 2019. By end 2019, overnight

SLIBOR and 12-month SLIBOR were at 7.51 per

cent and 10.33 per cent, respectively, compared

to 9.00 per cent and 11.80 per cent at end 2018.

To support economic activity further, the Central

Bank reduced policy interest rates by another 75

basis points during the first quarter of 2020, and

the AWCMR also declined. Meanwhile, the Central

Bank decided to discontinue the compilation and

publication of SLIBOR with effect from 01 July

2020. This decision was taken in consideration

of the lack of usage of SLIBOR in benchmarking

loan products in the domestic financial market,

the global trend of phasing out the compilation

and publication of offered rates including the

London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), requests

from several LCBs to discontinue the reporting of

offered rates in the context of thin interbank market

volumes for longer tenures, and the availability

of alternative benchmark interest rates in the

domestic financial market. The Central Bank will

continue to publish SLIBOR based on the offered

rates submitted by the LCBs until 30 June 2020,

enabling market participants to switch to alternative

benchmark interest rates.

Yields on Government Securities

Reflecting eased monetary conditions,

yields on government securities showed

a notable decline during 2019, although a

marginal uptick in yields on Treasury bills was

observed towards the latter part of 2019 due to

weakened sentiments amidst the rising funding

requirement of the government. Surplus liquidity

conditions along with the accommodative monetary

policy stance of the Central Bank, availability of

foreign financing with the proceeds of ISB issuances

in March and June 2019, streamlined Treasury bond

primary auction system and well anchored inflation

expectations resulted in a notable decline in yields on

government securities during 2019 compared to the

levels observed at end 2018. The release of liquidity

through the reduction of the SRR in November 2018

and March 2019 by the Central Bank prompted

most commercial banks to increase investment in

government securities, given the sluggish growth of

credit to the private sector. The imposition of caps on

deposit interest rates offered by financial institutions

in April 2019, which resulted in a notable decline in

deposit interest rates, would also have contributed to

reducing yields on government securities due to the

possible shift of savings from financial institutions

to government securities. However, some uptick in

yields on Treasury bills was observed during late

2019, reflecting the impact of outflows of foreign

investment from the government securities market,

uncertainty in the direction of fiscal policy and

increased funding requirement of the government.

In spite of this uptick, primary market yields on 91-

day, 182-day and 364-day Treasury bills decreased

by 250 basis points, 197 basis points and 275 basis

points to 7.51 per cent, 8.02 per cent and 8.45 per

cent, respectively, during 2019.

MONETARY POLICY, INTEREST RATES, MONEY AND CREDIT

249

Consistent with the overall reduction in

market interest rates, yields on Treasury bonds

in the primary market declined substantially

during 2019, while the government also

issued foreign currency denominated debt

instruments at competitive yields. The

government relied more on short to medium term

Treasury bond issuances during the first half of

2019, while Treasury bonds with longer maturities

of 10 to 20 years were issued mostly during the

second half of 2019. Accordingly, Treasury bond

yields on short to medium maturities declined

by around 182-223 basis points, while yields on

longer maturities recorded a decline of around

131-200 basis points in the primary market during

2019. With these declines, yields on maturities of

10 years, 15 years and 20 years were recorded

at 10.23 per cent, 10.59 per cent and 10.68 per

cent, respectively, by end 2019. Further, in early

2020, yields on 10-year Treasury bonds fell below

10 per cent, recording the lowest yields on 10-

year maturities after 2015. Noticeably, the upward

pressure observed in the yields on Treasury

bills towards end 2019 was not observed in the

primary Treasury bond market. Meanwhile, the

government issued foreign currency denominated

debt securities, namely, Sri Lanka Development

Bonds (SLDBs) and ISBs during the year, which

also helped ease the pressure on yields on rupee

denominated debt instruments to some extent.

The government issued short and medium term

US dollar denominated SLDBs at various fixed

and floating rates in auctions held in January

and May 2019, thereby raising US dollars 179.7

million, and US dollars 165.5 million, respectively.

Interest rates of SLDB issuances across all

tenures showed mixed movements during 2019.

Further, the two ISB issuances in March and June

2019 raised US dollars 2.4 billion and US dollars

2.0 billion, respectively. In March 2019, ISBs of

5-year and 10-year tenures were issued at 6.85 per

cent and 7.85 per cent, respectively, which were

441-521 basis points above the corresponding US

Treasury yields at the time. ISBs of 5-year and

10-year tenures were issued in June 2019 at

6.35 per cent and 7.55 per cent, respectively,

which were 460-553 basis points above the

corresponding US Treasury yields at the time of

issuance.

Reflecting the overall downward adjustment

in primary market yields, the secondary

market yield curve for government securities

shifted downwards during the year 2019 with

a greater downward shift in short to medium

term yields. Accordingly, yields on 91-day, 182-

day and 364-day Treasury bills in the secondary

market decreased by 215 basis points, 208 basis

points and 255 basis points, respectively, to

7.52 per cent, 7.88 per cent and 8.36 per cent

by end 2019, compared to the yields recorded at

end 2018. Treasury bond yields also decreased

by around 164 to 256 basis points during 2019.

Secondary market yields on 2-year bonds

decreased by 256 basis points to 8.60 per cent,

while yields on 5-year and 10-year Treasury bonds

decreased by 191 basis points and 182 basis

points, respectively, to 9.67 per cent and 10.05

per cent by end 2019, in comparison to the yields

at end 2018. The downward shift in the yield curve

reflected improved market sentiments following

the ISB issuances, eased monetary policy and

monetary conditions, and also well anchored

inflation expectations.

Deposit and Lending Interest Rates

A notable decline in deposit interest rates

of LCBs was observed since May 2019, in

response to policy and regulatory measures

taken by the Central Bank during the year.

The reduction in policy interest rates in May and

August 2019, improved liquidity conditions and

the imposition of maximum interest rate caps

on deposit products of banks and non bank

financial institutions with effect from 26 April 2019,

caused the decline in interest rates on deposits.

Accordingly, the Average Weighted Deposit

Rate (AWDR), which captures the movements in

interest rates of the outstanding stock of interest

bearing rupee deposits held with LCBs, declined

by 77 basis points to 8.20 per cent by end 2019

from 8.97 per cent at end April 2019. Further, the

Average Weighted Fixed Deposit Rate (AWFDR),

which is based on interest rates of outstanding

time deposits held with LCBs, also decreased by

110 basis points to 10.05 per cent by end 2019

from 11.15 per cent at end April 2019. At end

2018, AWDR and AWFDR were 8.81 per cent

and 10.85 per cent, respectively. Meanwhile, the

Average Weighted New Deposit Rate (AWNDR),

which captures the rates on all newly mobilised

interest bearing rupee deposits during a month,

declined by 284 basis points to 8.40 per cent by

August 2019 from 11.24 per cent at end April 2019.

However, with the removal of deposit rate caps

for licensed banks with effect from 24 September

2019, the AWNDR increased by 49 basis points

during the period from September to end 2019.

In spite of the reduced deposit interest rates,

depositors benefitted from positive real returns

during 2019, as inflation remained low relative to

deposit rates.

Lending rates of commercial banks,

which remained downward rigid despite the

accommodative monetary policy measures

of the Central Bank, declined notably with the

imposition of caps on lending interest rates

in September 2019. In spite of the adoption of

an accommodative monetary policy stance and

reduced cost of funds, particularly due to the

imposition of deposit rate caps and the reduction

in the SRR, market lending rates remained at

elevated levels during the first nine months of

the year. Accordingly, the Central Bank imposed

ceilings on lending rates with effect from 24

September 2019 with the aim of enhancing the

efficiency of the transmission of monetary policy

measures to market interest rates. Specifically,

the order issued by the Central Bank to licensed

banks required a reduction of lending rates of

rupee denominated loans and advances by 200

basis points by 15 October 2019 from the rates

that prevailed at end April 2019. Further, LCBs

were ordered to reduce their weekly average

weighted prime lending rates by 150 basis points

by 01 November 2019 and 250 basis points by

27 December 2019 from the levels reported as

at 26 April 2019. In addition, the interest rates on

credit card advances and pre-arranged temporary

overdrafts were also capped at a maximum of 28

per cent per annum and 24 per cent per annum,

respectively, with effect from 01 November 2019.

In response to these monetary and regulatory

measures, the weekly Average Weighted Prime

Lending Rate (AWPR), which is based on interest

rates applicable on short term loans and advances

granted by all LCBs to their prime customers during

a week, declined by 235 basis points to 9.74 per

cent by end 2019 from 12.09 per cent recorded at

end 2018. Moreover, the monthly AWPR, which

is the simple average of weekly AWPR, declined

by 194 basis points to 10.00 per cent by end 2019

from 11.94 per cent at end 2018. The Average

Weighted New Lending Rate (AWNLR), which

captures rates on all new loans and advances

extended by commercial banks during a particular

month, also declined by 174 basis points from

end 2018 to 12.80 per cent by end 2019. The

Average Weighted Lending Rate (AWLR), which

is based on interest rates of all outstanding loans

and advances extended by LCBs, declined by

81 basis points to 13.59 per cent during 2019.

Meanwhile, bankwise average weighted lending

rates were in the range of 9.41-16.66 per cent at

end 2019 compared to the range of 10.96-17.25

per cent recorded at end 2018. Further, lending

rates against all types of securities, except the

category of motor vehicles including tractors,

marked a reduction by end 2019 compared to the

levels recorded at end 2018. However, the degree

of adjustment of lending rates during the year has

been less than envisaged.

The Legal Rate and the Market Rate of

interest,1 as determined by the Monetary Board

and published in the Government Gazette at the

end of each year, were 11.64 per cent per annum

for 2020, compared to 11.50 per cent per annum

for 2019. The Legal Rate and the Market Rate for

2020 were computed based on simple averages of

monthly AWDR and AWLR of commercial banks,

which prevailed during the preceding twelve

months ending October 2019.

Interest Rates on Corporate Debt Instruments

Interest rates applicable on corporate debt

instruments, which remained high during early

2019, declined gradually by end 2019. Interest

rates on commercial paper, which is a short term

debt instrument, ranged between 13.00-16.25 per

cent during 2019 compared to a range of 13.10-

15.00 per cent in 2018. Meanwhile, 30 new listings

of debentures were reported by 14 corporates

during 2019 with multiple maturities from 4 to 10

years, in comparison to 21 new listings reported

in 2018. Most debentures were issued under fixed

interest rates, which ranged between 12.30-15.50

per cent in 2019 compared to the range of 12.00-

14.75 per cent in 2018. Floating rates were in the

range of 12.93-13.60 per cent in 2019. Interest

rates on corporate debt instruments declined during

the latter part of the year in line with the decline in

market interest rates.

1 The Legal Rate is defined under the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 6 of 1990 and is applicable to any legal action for the recovery of a sum of money. The Market Rate is defined under the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No. 2 of 1990 and is applicable only in relation to legal actions instituted by lending institutions for the recovery of debt exceeding Rs. 150,000 arising out of commercial transactions, where there is no agreed rate of interest.

Interest Rates on Foreign Currency Deposits

Despite the decline in global interest rates,

interest rates applicable on foreign currency

deposits maintained with commercial banks

remained broadly unchanged during 2019,

due to increased opportunities for domestic

investment in foreign currency. The US Federal

Reserve reduced its federal funds target rate three

times during the year by a total of 75 basis points

to 1.50-1.75 per cent by end 2019, compared to

the tightening bias observed in 2018. However,

the Bank of England, which increased its policy

rate in early August 2018, kept the rate unchanged

in 2019. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank

announced a monetary stimulus package by re-

commencing asset purchases in November 2019.

However, the decline observed in interest rates

applicable on foreign currency deposits of licensed

banks domestically was not commensurate to

the reduction observed in interest rates globally,

due to increased opportunities for domestic

investment in foreign currency, including greater

demand for foreign currency from the government.

Accordingly, interest rates pertaining to US dollar

denominated domestic time deposits marginally

declined to a range of 0.20 – 5.50 per cent by

end 2019 from the range of 0.25-6.00 per cent

at end 2018, while interest rates on the US dollar

denominated savings deposits ranged between

0.02-4.50 per cent by end 2019 compared to the

range of 0.02 – 4.12 per cent at end 2018. Interest

rates applicable on the pound sterling denominated

time deposits remained broadly unchanged in a

range of 0.10-3.52 per cent by end 2019 compared

to the range of 0.10-3.50 per cent at end 2018.

Interest rates on savings deposits denominated in

pound sterling also remained broadly unchanged

in the range of 0.10 – 2.46 per cent by end 2019.

7.4 Movements in Monetary and

Credit Aggregates

Reserve Money

Reserve money, which is the monetary base

of the economy, recorded a contraction during

2019, reflecting the impact of the reduction in

the SRR by 1.00 percentage point in March 2019.

Accordingly, reserve money contracted by 3.0 per

cent, year-on-year, at end 2019 compared to the

growth of 2.3 per cent recorded at end 2018. In

absolute terms, reserve money contracted by Rs.

28.5 billion to Rs. 932.6 billion during 2019, compared

to an expansion of Rs. 21.3 billion in the previous

year. With the reduction in the SRR in March 2019,

commercial banks’ deposits with the Central Bank

decreased by Rs. 65.5 billion to Rs. 254.6 billion by

end 2019, recording a negative growth of 20.5 per

cent, year-on-year, and causing the contraction in

reserve money. Currency in circulation, which is the

largest component of reserve money, recorded a

lower annual increase of Rs. 37.0 billion to Rs. 678.0

billion by end 2019, compared to the increase of Rs.

42.9 billion in 2018. Currency in circulation during

the first half of the year slowed down primarily due to

the opportunity cost of holding currency due to high

market interest rates, particularly during the first four

months of the year and subdued economic activity,

impacted further by the Easter Sunday attacks.

The decline in market deposit rates in response to

monetary and regulatory measures and the gradual

recovery of economic activity from the impact of

the Easter Sunday attacks led to an increase in

currency in circulation thereafter. Accordingly,

currency in circulation recorded a moderate growth

of 5.8 per cent by end 2019 on a year-on-year basis,

in comparison to a growth of 7.2 per cent in 2018.

Viewed from the assets side, the negative

growth of reserve money during 2019 can be

attributed to the notable contraction in NDA

of the Central Bank, which outweighed the

expansion in NFA of the Central Bank. The

contraction in NDA of the Central Bank, was

mainly on account of the decline in net credit

to the government (NCG). NDA of the Central

Bank contracted by Rs. 173.9 billion to Rs. 36.6

billion by end 2019 in comparison to an increase

of Rs. 116.9 billion during 2018. NCG by the

Central Bank declined due to the reduction of

government securities holdings of the Central

Bank (net of repurchase transactions), which were

mainly acquired during late 2018 under reverse

repurchase agreements when injecting liquidity

to the domestic money market. The decision by

the Monetary Board not to subscribe to primary

issuances of Treasury bills, except under

exceptional circumstances, also contributed to

the decline in NCG. Accordingly, holdings of

government securities by the Central Bank (net of

repurchase transactions) decreased by Rs. 147.6

billion to Rs. 126.9 billion by end 2019. However,

provisional advances to the government increased

by Rs. 38.0 billion to Rs. 236.6 billion by end 2019

with the utilisation of the due amount for 2019

by the government at the beginning of the year.

Overall, NCG by the Central Bank declined by

Rs. 109.8 billion during 2019. In contrast, NFA of the

Central Bank increased by Rs. 145.5 billion during

2019, compared to the decline of Rs. 95.6 billion

in 2018. The expansion in NFA was mainly due to

the increase in foreign assets of the Central Bank

due to the sale of ISB proceeds by the government

to the Central Bank and purchases of foreign

exchange from the domestic foreign exchange

market by the Central Bank and increased fixed

income securities investments by the Central Bank,

while a contraction was recorded in foreign liabilities

of the Central Bank. This contraction in foreign

liabilities of the Central Bank mainly during the last

quarter of 2019 was due to the utilisation of foreign

funds in the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury (DST)

Accounts (which is considered as a foreign liability

for statistical purposes) by the government and the

decline in foreign currency payables of the Central

Bank during the year.

The money multiplier, which is the ratio

between the broad money supply (M2b) and

reserve money, increased notably in 2019,

reflecting the effect of the reduction in the SRR

during the year. The M2b money multiplier increased

to 8.18 by end 2019 compared to 7.42 recorded

at end 2018, while on average, it stood at 8.03 in

2019 compared to an average of 6.92 recorded in

2018. Contributing to the rise in money multiplier, the

currency to deposits ratio declined to 6.9 per cent by

end 2019 from 7.1 per cent recorded at end 2018,

mainly due to the prevalence of relatively high market

deposit rates particularly in early 2019, despite the

increase in the currency to deposit ratio towards the

latter part of 2019 with the policy induced reduction

in deposit rates during this period.

Narrow Money (M1)

Narrow money (M1), which comprises

currency and demand deposits held by the

public, grew moderately amidst subdued

economic activity, and recorded a growth of 4.2

per cent, year-on-year, by end 2019, compared

to the growth of 4.7 per cent at end 2018.

Accordingly, narrow money increased by Rs. 34.7

billion during 2019, as a result of the increase in both

currency and demand deposits held by the public.

Currency held by the public recorded a moderate

growth of 4.5 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2019,

compared to 7.7 per cent at end 2018. In absolute

terms, currency held by the public increased by

Rs. 21.1 billion in 2019, compared to an increase

of Rs. 33.7 billion during 2018. Meanwhile, demand

deposits held by the public with commercial banks

recorded a growth of 3.8 per cent, year-on-year, by

end 2019, compared to the growth of 1.1 per cent

at end 2018, reflecting the impact of lower deposit

rates offered by LCBs, which in turn reduced the

opportunity cost of maintaining demand deposits.

In absolute terms, demand deposits held by the

public with commercial banks increased by Rs.

13.5 billion during 2019, compared to an increase

of Rs. 3.8 billion in 2018.

Broad Money (M2b) and Domestic Credit

Broad money growth (M2b) continued to

decelerate during 2019, owing to the moderation

in the growth of NDA of the banking system.

Accordingly, the year-on-year growth of M2b

decelerated to 7.0 per cent by end December 2019

compared to the growth of 13.0 per cent at end

2018. The slowdown in the growth of broad money

was largely due to the moderation in the growth

of NDA of the banking system led by the notable

deceleration in the growth of credit extended to

the private sector, notwithstanding the expansion

in NFA of the banking sector during the period

under review. The recovery in the growth of credit

extended to the private sector towards the end of

2019 supported an acceleration in broad money

growth in December 2019.

Viewing from the liabilities side of broad

money, the deceleration in the year-on-year

growth of time and savings deposits held by

the public with LCBs largely contributed to the

slowdown in monetary expansion. Accordingly,

the year-on-year growth of time and savings

deposits decelerated significantly to 7.3 per cent

by end 2019 compared to the growth of 14.2 per

cent recorded at end 2018. In absolute terms,

time and savings deposits of LCBs increased by

Rs. 461.2 billion in 2019 compared to the increase

of Rs. 782.7 billion recorded in 2018. The increase

in time and savings deposits accounted for about

93 per cent of the year-on-year expansion in broad

money in 2019, marginally below 95 per cent

recorded in the previous year, while the remainder

was due to the expansion in currency and demand

deposits.

NFA of the banking system recorded an

increase in 2019, reflecting the rise in NFA

of both the Central Bank and LCBs, thereby

positively contributing to the broad money

expansion. NFA of the banking system, which

remained negative during October 2018 through

February 2019, turned to positive levels thereafter

and recorded a cumulative increase of Rs. 195.3

billion in 2019, in comparison to a contraction of

Rs. 188.5 billion in 2018. NFA of the Central Bank

recorded an increase of Rs. 145.5 billion during

2019, following a contraction of Rs. 95.6 billion in

2018, on account of the combined impact of the

increase in foreign assets and the decline in foreign

liabilities of the Central Bank during the period

under review. NFA of commercial banks also

increased by Rs. 49.8 billion in 2019, compared

to a decline of Rs. 92.9 billion in 2018, due to

the expansion in NFA of Offshore Banking Units

(OBUs) of LCBs, while NFA of Domestic Banking

Units (DBUs) recorded a contraction during the

year. NFA of OBUs increased by Rs. 77.7 billion

in 2019 following a contraction of Rs. 41.9 billion

in 2018, due to the increase in placements with

banks abroad and lending to non residents along

with the contraction in foreign liabilities, particularly

in terms of lower borrowings from banks abroad

and deposits from non residents. In contrast, NFA

of DBUs declined by Rs. 27.9 billion during 2019,

continuing the trend observed in the previous year.

This was mainly due to the contraction in foreign

assets in the form of placements with banks abroad

and an increase in foreign currency liabilities by way

of borrowings from abroad and deposit liabilities of

non residents.

NDA of the banking system expanded

at a slower pace during the year, due to the

slowdown in credit extended to both private

and public sectors. In absolute terms, NDA of

the banking system increased by Rs. 300.6 billion

in 2019 compared to a notable expansion of

Rs. 1,008.8 billion in 2018. The moderation in NDA

during the year was largely driven by the slowdown

observed in the growth of credit extended to

the private sector by commercial banks, while

the growth of credit obtained by public sector,

consisting of the government and SOBEs, also

moderated compared to 2018.

NCG by the banking system continued

to increase in 2019, albeit at a slower pace

compared to 2018. On account of the increase in

NCG by commercial banks, NCG by the banking

system increased by Rs. 250.4 billion in 2019

compared to an increase of Rs. 348.2 billion in

2018. Accordingly, NCG by LCBs increased by

Rs. 360.2 billion in 2019 compared to the increase

of Rs. 100.5 billion in 2018. NCG by DBUs

increased notably by Rs. 335.2 billion in 2019

following an increase of Rs. 66.6 billion in 2018

with the increase in investments in government

securities, including Treasury bills, Treasury bonds

and SLDBs, despite the decline in government

overdraft balances with commercial banks

during the year. The increase in investments in

government securities by LCBs during the year is

partly attributed to the improved liquidity levels of

LCBs with the reduction in the SRR amidst subdued

demand for credit by the private sector during the

period under review. NCG by OBUs recorded

an increase of Rs. 24.9 billion compared to an

increase of Rs. 33.9 billion recorded in the previous

year, on account of an increase in direct loans to

the government, while investments in SLDBs by

OBUs recorded a notable contraction during the

year as SLDBs were not issued on a regular basis

due to the availability of funds from ISBs in 2019.

Meanwhile, NCG from the Central Bank contracted

by Rs. 109.8 billion in 2019, in contrast to a notable

expansion of Rs. 247.7 billion recorded in 2018,

due to the decline in Treasury bill holdings (net of

repurchase transactions) of the Central Bank. This

was mainly due to the decline in reverse repurchase

transactions of the Central Bank with improved

liquidity in the money market compared to end

2018, and the decision by the Monetary Board not

to subscribe to primary issuances of Treasury bills,

except under exceptional circumstances.

Credit extended to SOBEs by the banking

system, which recorded a cumulative

contraction during the first eight months of

2019, expanded thereafter reflecting increased

borrowing by several key SOBEs. Accordingly,

during the first eight months of 2019, credit

obtained by SOBEs from the banking system

declined by Rs. 8.5 billion, largely due to

repayments made by the Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation (CPC) during the first seven months

of 2019, following a notable expansion of credit

to SOBEs by Rs. 218.4 billion in 2018. However,

borrowings of SOBEs in 2019 recorded an

increase of Rs. 62.6 billion, partly reflecting the

deteriorated financial position of most SOBEs

towards the end of 2019. Credit obtained by the

Road Development Authority (RDA) increased by

Rs. 27.9 billion, while borrowings by the Ceylon

Electricity Board (CEB) increased by Rs. 21.0

billion in 2019. Further, borrowings by CPC, which

recorded a net repayment of Rs. 52.5 billion

during the first seven months of 2019, increased

thereafter recording an increase of Rs. 14.4

billion by end 2019, reflecting weakened financial

performance. In addition, bank borrowings of the

National Water Supply & Drainage Board (NWS&DB)

and the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC)

increased by Rs. 8.5 billion and Rs. 1.8 billion,

respectively, during the year. Meanwhile, the

Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE), the

Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and the Ceylon

Fertilizer Corporation repaid their liabilities to LCBs,

by a total of Rs. 5.7 billion during the year.

The growth of credit to the private sector

by commercial banks decelerated sharply in

2019, in contrast to the higher than projected

expansion in the past few years, although some

recovery in credit disbursements was observed

towards the end of 2019 supported by the

monetary policy easing measures. Accordingly,

the year-on-year growth of credit extended to

the private sector decelerated to 4.3 per cent by

end 2019, recording the lowest annual growth

since 2009, and significantly below the growth of

15.9 per cent recorded at end 2018. In absolute

terms, credit to the private sector expanded only by

Rs. 236.8 billion in 2019, which was remarkably low

in comparison to the expansion of Rs. 762.1 billion

recorded in 2018. The rapid slowdown in credit

extended to the private sector, particularly in the first

half of the year, was largely due to the relatively high

market lending rates, settlement of arrears owed to

private contractors by the government on account

of various projects, which enabled repayments

to the banking sector, and low demand for credit

amidst uncertainty following the Easter Sunday

attacks and weak business confidence as well as

subdued economic activity. Meanwhile, due to the

increase in non performing loan (NPL) volumes

amidst the adverse business environment, banks

followed a risk averse approach, which constrained

credit disbursements to the private sector from the

supply side. However, credit flows to the private

sector displayed some recovery towards the

end of 2019 in terms of absolute disbursements,

supported by accommodative monetary policy

measures of the Central Bank and the regulatory

measures adopted to expedite the transmission

of monetary easing measures into market lending

rates. Accordingly, monthly credit disbursement

by LCBs continued to expand from August 2019

onwards, and the increase in credit during the last

five months of the year accounted for about 86

per cent of the annual expansion in credit to the

private sector. As per the security wise analysis of

advances, credit against Gold and Other Precious

Metals under Pawning; Immovable Property; and

Other Securities increased during the year, while

credit against Personal Guarantees and Promissory

Notes; and Fixed, Savings and Other Deposits

recorded a contraction. Although it was expected

that the year-on-year growth of private sector credit

would pick up to around 12-13 per cent by end

2020, disruptions to economic activity due to the

spread of the COVID-19 outbreak and measures

to contain its further spread, are likely to result

in a subdued demand for credit in 2020 as well.

However, the envisaged decline in market lending

rates supported by the current accommodative

monetary policy stance, the expected expansion

in economic activity supported by fiscal stimulus,

the announced debt moratorium and special credit

support scheme for SMEs and other affected

sectors are likely to help support an expansion in

credit once COVID-19 related disruptions subside.

As per the Quarterly Survey of Commercial

Banks’ Loans and Advances to the Private

Sector, growth of credit to all major economic

sectors continued to decelerate during 2019.

Accordingly, reflecting the subdued activity in the

agriculture sector, particularly in the second half

of 2019, growth of credit to the Agriculture and

Fishing sector decelerated substantially to 0.2 per

cent, year-on-year, by end 2019, in comparison

to the growth of 14.0 per cent at end 2018. Within

this sector, credit flows to Tea; Vegetable and Fruit

Cultivation and Minor Food Crops; and Rubber

subsectors recorded a substantial decline by end

2019 compared to end 2018, reflecting mainly

the impact of unfavourable weather conditions

during the year. Nevertheless, credit granted to

some agriculture sectors such as Paddy; Coconut;

Livestock and Dairy Farming; and Fisheries

subsectors recorded moderate expansions by end

2019 compared to end 2018. Meanwhile, growth

of credit to the Industry sector decelerated to 3.1

per cent, year-on-year, by end 2019, from 15.3 per

cent at end 2018. Within the Industry sector, credit to the Construction subsector, which accounted

for around 49 per cent of the total credit flows to

the Industry sector, recorded a moderate growth of

5.6 per cent, year-on-year, by end 2019, compared

to the growth of 14.1 per cent at end 2018. Credit

to other subsectors, namely Textiles and Apparel,

and Food and Beverages also recorded moderate

year-on-year growth rates of 6.5 per cent and 4.9

per cent, respectively, by end 2019, compared to

the higher growth rates of 15.4 per cent and 18.6

per cent, respectively, at end 2018. Contributing to

the slowdown in credit flows to the Industry sector,

by end 2019, reflecting subdued export and

domestic demand. Meanwhile, growth of credit to

the Services sector also decelerated to 3.1 per cent,

year-on-year, by end 2019, compared to the growth

of 17.8 per cent at end 2018. Slowdown in overall

economic activity following the Easter Sunday

attacks affected the Services sector activities

significantly. Contributing to the slowdown in credit to

the Services sector, growth of credit to the Financial

and Business Services subsector declined by 6.5

per cent, year-on-year, by end 2019, compared

to the high growth of 29.3 per cent at end 2018,

amidst policy measures to curtail the importation of

personal motor vehicles during 2019. Nevertheless,

reflecting increased credit flows to the tourism

sector in view of the debt moratorium granted to

tourism related industries and other measures to

boost the industry after the Easter Sunday attacks,

credit to the Tourism subsector expanded notably

and recorded a year-on-year growth of 18.5 per

cent by end 2019, compared to the growth of 15.3

per cent at end 2018. Further, credit to Wholesale

and Retail Trade and Shipping, Aviation and Freight

Forwarding subsectors also recorded moderate

expansions by end 2019 compared to end 2018.

Personal Loans and Advances, which grew by over

20 per cent, year-on-year, during the first half of

2019, recorded a moderate growth of 11.9 per cent,

year-on-year, by end 2019, compared to the growth

of 20.3 per cent at end 2018. Within Personal Loans

and Advances, the Consumer Durables subsector

recorded a moderate growth of 4.7 per cent,

year-on-year, by end 2019, compared to the

growth of 8.7 per cent at end 2018. However,

Pawning advances and Credit Card advances grew

notably by 22.8 per cent and 22.9 per cent, year-

on-year, respectively, by end 2019 in comparison

to the growth rates of 15.7 per cent and 16.5 per

cent, respectively, at end 2018. The latter was

mainly due to attractive further promotional offers

provided by commercial banks for their credit card

users during the year. Further, in terms of maturity

analysis of outstanding credit to the private sector

by commercial banks, a slowdown was observed

across all tenures. Accordingly, the growth of

short term, medium term and long term facilities

decelerated to 3.0 per cent, 3.4 per cent and 8.0

per cent, respectively, by end 2019, in comparison

to 17.6 per cent, 10.4 per cent and 21.7 per cent,

respectively, at end 2018.

Broad Money (M4)

The growth of broad money supply (M4),

measured using the Financial Survey,2

moderated during 2019, due to the notable

deceleration in NDA of LCBs, despite some

acceleration in NDA of Licensed Specialised

Banks (LSBs) and Licensed Finance

Companies (LFCs) during the year. The year-

on-year growth of M4, which closely follows the

trend in M2b, decelerated to 8.2 per cent by end

2019 compared to the growth of 12.0 per cent

recorded at end 2018. Viewed from the liabilities

side of M4, total time and savings deposits held

by the public at LCBs, LSBs and LFCs grew at a

modest pace of 8.5 per cent, year-on-year, by end

2019, compared to 12.7 per cent recorded at end

2018. However, during 2019, the year-on-year

growth of time and savings deposits held by the

public with LSBs and LFCs accelerated to 17.8

per cent and 4.9 per cent, respectively, compared

to 11.3 per cent and 1.0 per cent, respectively,

recorded at end 2018, reflecting relatively high

interest rates offered on deposits by the non bank

sector. On the assets side, the absolute increase

in M4 was due to the expansion in NFA of both the

Central Bank and licensed banks as well as the

increase in NDA of both licensed banks and LFCs

during the year. Accordingly, domestic credit of

LSBs and LFCs increased by Rs. 160.3 billion,

while NFA of LSBs increased by Rs. 54.7 billion

during 2019.

Reflecting subdued economic activity, the

growth of credit to the private sector in M4 also

decelerated to 3.9 per cent, year-on-year, by

end 2019 compared to 14.9 per cent at end 2018.

The growth of credit granted to the private sector

by LSBs and LFCs, which contributed around 26

per cent to credit extended to the private sector as

per the financial survey, decelerated during 2019.

Accordingly, year-on-year growth of credit granted

to the private sector by LSBs moderated to 8.0

per cent at end 2019 from 11.4 per cent recorded

at end 2018, while growth of credit granted to the

private sector by LFCs declined notably to -0.3

per cent, by the end 2019, compared to 13.0 per

cent recorded at end 2018. The contraction of

credit extended to the private sector by LFCs in

2019 was partly due to the restrictions imposed on

vehicle related lending and increased risk aversion

due to rising NPLs in the non bank financial sector.

Accordingly, in absolute terms, compared to the

expansion of Rs. 975.3 billion during 2018, the

expansion in credit extended to the private sector

in M4 was recorded at Rs. 293.4 billion during

2019. Meanwhile, NCG by LSBs increased by

Rs. 95.3 billion in 2019 compared to a decline of

Rs. 27.1 billion in 2018, while NCG by LFCs

expanded by Rs. 8.4 billion in 2019, compared to

a decrease of Rs. 35 million in 2018. Overall, NCG

under M4 increased by Rs. 354.1 billion in absolute

terms in 2019, compared to Rs. 321.1 billion

recorded in 2018.

7.5 Future Developments,

Challenges and Outlook

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and

its potential significant impact on the domestic

economy and financial markets underscores

the need for alternative monetary policy

instruments, particularly as the country moves

to a low interest rate regime. Amidst the concerns

about the potential economic setback due to the

COVID-19 pandemic, the Central Bank proactively

eased the monetary policy stance by lowering policy

interest rates and the SRR while providing adequate

liquidity to the market in order to meet urgent

liquidity requirements of the economy. Meanwhile,

the Central Bank purchased Treasury bills from the

primary market to fulfill urgent cash requirements of

the government under exceptional circumstances.

However, the conventional monetary policy tools

often render limited support in the wake of large

economic shocks, particularly due to constrained

policy spaces to allow larger adjustments in policy

interest rates, and weak monetary transmission.

Further, a significant reduction of interest rates to

very low levels, as practiced in many developed

countries, may lead to unintended consequences in

countries such as Sri Lanka, given the considerable

proportion of population that depend on interest

income on savings, and the relatively underdeveloped

alternative financial markets. In this context, the

Central Bank may also need to explore alternative

and unconventional monetary policy instruments,

considering the size of the economic shock and

potential economic consequences. For instance, the

feasibility of allowing the Central Bank to engage

in quantitative easing, through direct purchases of

non government assets must be explored, thereby

enabling the Central Bank to provide liquidity to the

participants in the financial market directly, and also

influence not only the shorter end of the yield curve

but also the longer end of the yield curve within a

short period of time. However, the underdeveloped

capital markets in Sri Lanka could constrain the

effectiveness of such policies, unless urgent

measures are taken to broaden and deepen the

capital market.

Credit extended to the private sector by the

financial system measured as a percentage

of GDP, which is a major indicator of financial

deepening of the economy, remained moderate

compared to Sri Lanka’s regional peers, reflecting

the need to broaden the financial system further

to spur economic growth. As measured by the M4

MONETARY POLICY, INTEREST RATES, MONEY AND CREDIT

broad money supply, credit extended to the private

sector by the financial system as a percentage of

GDP was estimated at around 51.9 per cent by end

2019. Although the private sector credit to GDP ratio

has gradually increased over the past, the pace of

this increase remained well below the expansion

in most regional peers such as Thailand, Malaysia

and Vietnam. As per the latest World Development

Indicators of the World Bank, private sector credit

to GDP ratios in these countries ranged from 120

per cent to 161 per cent. The relatively low credit to

GDP ratio in Sri Lanka can be attributed to several

structural issues in the financial system including the

weak financial outreach and lack of financial literacy.

In addition, the cautious behaviour of investors as

well as the financial institutions amidst economic,

political and global uncertainties also explains the

moderate level of credit to GDP ratio in the country.

The prevalence of a large informal sector also

contributes to the lower recorded levels of credit to

GDP ratio. Further, as per the sectoral classification

of private sector credit, higher credit to GDP ratios

are observed in agriculture and industrial sectors,

while a low level is observed in the services sector,

which contributes around 60 per cent of the overall

GDP. This partly reflects the need for improving

efficiency in resource allocation. Such improvements

in efficiency of allocating financial resources towards

more productive sectors of the economy could also

help the informal sector including micro, small and

medium scale enterprises (MSMEs) to converge

with the formal sector. Further, enhancing access

to finance as well as financial literacy, along with

measures to minimise the impact of large borrowings

by the public sector are also priority areas in

promoting credit to the private sector and economic

growth over the medium term, in order to prevent

possible crowding out effects in future.

Continuing the substantial progress made

thus far on adopting flexible inflation targeting

as the monetary policy framework, the Central

Bank of Sri Lanka will pursue initiatives to

ensure maintaining low and stable levels of

inflation while supporting the economy to

achieve its potential. An essential aspect of

the institutionalisation process is streamlining

of the monetary policy formulation process,

which has continued to evolve into a proactive

and preemptive data driven decision making

process. In order to promote transparency and

accountability, the Central Bank consistently

engages with the general public through the

regular issuance of forward looking monetary

policy statements. The continuous improvements

in the Central Bank’s communications strategy

are expected to improve the general public’s

understanding of the monetary policy framework,

thereby further strengthening the ability of the

Central Bank to anchor inflation expectations.

Along with the increased efficacy of monetary

policy making in managing demand driven inflation

and inflation expectations by the Central Bank, the

government is also expected to play a proactive

role in addressing price pressures stemming from

transitory supply side disruptions. Moreover, the

government’s continued commitment to fiscal

consolidation is essential to sustain inflation at

desired levels over the medium term, despite the

possible fiscal slippage that could be expected in

the near term due to the outbreak of the COVID-19

pandemic and the government’s efforts to contain

its spread and mitigate its economic impact. The

necessary legal framework to update the 70-year

old Monetary Law Act was prepared in 2019,

which awaits finalisation upon further review by

the government.
