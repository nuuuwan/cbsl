"Rapid  technological  advancements  in  the  world  over 
Introduction
the  last  two  decades  have  led  to  a  variety  of  new 
Global  demand  for  food  is  growing  continuously  as 
a  result  of  population  growth  and  dietary  changes, 
and as per the World Population Prospects - 2019 of

the  United  Nations,  the  world  population  is  expected 
accuracy  than  ever  before.  Countries  such  as  India, 
to  reach  9.7  billion  by  2050  from  today’s  7.8  billion 
Israel  and  Brazil  have  experienced  rapid  transitions  in 
level.  Rise 
in  population  brings  a 
sustainability issues, including food security. Sri Lanka, 
and usage of advanced technologies. Although an array 
as  a  developing  nation,  faces  similar  concerns  about 
of new technological adoptions such as vertical farming, 
food  security  amidst  growing  population,  substantial 
postharvest losses and regular adverse weather shocks, 
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are available in 
and these challenges need to be tackled through efficient 
Sri Lanka too, usage of these technologies is relatively 
agriculture practices. The recent COVID-19 pandemic 
limited. Therefore, Sri Lanka still has a long way to go 
has also reiterated the importance of food security for a 
to  embrace  new  advanced  technologies  for  farming 
developing nation such as ours. Traditional agriculture, 
through  the  accumulation  of  farmers’  knowledge  and 
experiences, managed to feed the entire population for 
many  centuries  in  the  past.  The  cascade  tank-village 
system  (Ellanga  system),  the  hill  side  cascade  paddy 
fields  (Helmalu)  and  the  irrigation  systems  developed 
in the historical past were remarkable agro-biodiversity 
systems in Sri Lanka with regard to water management 
efficiency,  climate  change  adaptability  and  buffers 
against natural disasters such as floods, droughts and 
pest  attacks.  However,  during 
priority  was  given  to  plantation  agriculture  and  little 
attention was paid to other crop cultivations, except for 
subsistence  farming.  With  little  government  attention, 
subsistence farming alone became insufficient to meet 
the growing food demand in the country. Subsequently, 
the green revolution, which was a major policy response 
of  many  developing  nations  in  the  1960s,  sought  to 
increase the efficiency of agricultural processes through 
various techniques such as high yielding robust varieties, 
hybridised seeds, expansion of irrigation infrastructure, 
synthetic 
agriculture

food security as well  as  low  farmer  income. However, 
reverting back to the agro-ecosystem that is based on 
traditional  agriculture  practices  is  not  feasible  under 
the 
agriculture activities such as land and water resources 
have been diminishing rapidly owing to other industrial 
activities  and  urbanisation.  Despite  a  significant  share 
of  the  labour  force  employed  in  the  sector,  labour 
shortages  have  been  increasingly  common  in  relation 
to  labour  intensive  cultivation  activities.  In  addition, 
recent  experiences  of  erratic  weather  patterns  and 
resultant natural disasters, such as droughts and floods, 
tend  to  impose  additional  restrictions  on  agricultural 
activities.  These  trends  emphasise  the  importance  of 
improving  productivity  and  efficient  resource  usage  in 
the agriculture sector through innovative technologies.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
