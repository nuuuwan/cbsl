"competition.  Concerns  over 
the  adaptability  of  new 
technologies  have  shifted  the  agriculture  sector  from 
technologies, limited capital to make initial investment 
more  production  centric  activities 
to  market  centric 
activities  in  view  of  balancing  production  and  market 
demand conditions.  
Current  Status  of  New  Technology  Adoption  in 
Sri Lanka
Advanced 
technology 
usage 
agriculture 
sector 
is 
limited,  not  only  among 
farmers,  but  also  among  the  agribusinesses.  With  the 
aim  of  using  Information  Communication  Technology 
for productivity improvements in the agriculture sector, 
several  e-agriculture  programmes  such  as  interactive 
ICT  and  mobile  platforms  and  software  applications 
have been already developed to disseminate agriculture 
information.  Few  e-agriculture  services  such  as 
Wikigoviya  web,  AgMIS  (an  SMS  service  and  market 
price 
information 
system),  Boga  Purokathanaya 
mobile  phone  App 
that  provides  advice 
on  crops  that  should  be  cultivated  to  receive  a  better 
market price), SL paddy fertiliser (a mobile phone App 
that  provides 
fertiliser 
recommendations 
and  Govipola  (a  mobile  phone  App  that  supports  the 
farming  community  by  strengthening  market  linkages, 
improving  price  awareness  and  matching  supply  and 
demand to give easy access to markets) are currently in 
operation in Sri Lanka, as initiatives of the Department of 
Agriculture and several private institutions. Meanwhile, 
a seed and planting material management information 
system,  a  QR  code  system  for  GAP  certification,  and 
a  progress  monitoring  system  for  the  National  Food 
Production programme are currently being developed. 
In  addition,  the  Sri  Lanka  Institute  of  Nanotechnology 
(SLINTEC)  is  carrying  out  numerous  nanotechnology 
related research and development activities to produce 
slow-release 
fertiliser, 
nanofungicidal 
remediation 
and 
rehabilitation. 
private tech companies in Sri Lanka have also initiated 
several  technological  solutions  to  agricultural  matters, 
such as drone technology and smart weather solutions 
(e.g.  WeatherGuru).  Amidst 
movement of people and gatherings during the ongoing 
COVID-19  pandemic,  smart  technologies  and  social 
media  have  been  put  to  use  increasingly  to  support 
the 
agriculture 
supply 
chain, 
retailers  and  end  consumers.  In  the  same  vein,  smart 
technologies can be effectively used to link agriculture 
producers with markets to manage harvesting periods, 
reduce  postharvest 
losses  and  wastage  and  ensure 
better price realisation for the farming community. 
However,  research  and  development  initiatives  of  Sri 
Lankaâ€™s private sector in relation to advanced agriculture 
technologies  are 
still 
limited 
companies and a broad based use is yet to be realised. 
Further, agriculture firms as well as farmers in Sri Lanka 
appear to adopt new technologies slower than expected,
