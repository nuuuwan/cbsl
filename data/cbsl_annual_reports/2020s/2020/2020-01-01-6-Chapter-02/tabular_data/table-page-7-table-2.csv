reach the market. In addition to cold storage, numerous 
food supply chain inefficiencies indicate a disconnection 
between  supplier  and  retailer  in  the  sector.  Blockchain 
technology creates a direct link between all participants 
in the supply chain, ensuring efficiency, traceability and 
transparency at each stage of the production process. For 
example, the government of Thailand has introduced a 
pilot  project  to  use  blockchain  traceability  solutions  for 
organic  rice,  particularly  to  track  and  trace  Thailandâ€™s 
jasmine rice from production to export. In the sequence 
of  technological  developments,  drones  and  automated 
robots have emerged as versatile technologies for smart 
farming activities. Drone technology is used for soil and 
field  analysis,  planting,  crop  spraying,  crop  monitoring 
and  analysis,  irrigation,  and  crop  health  assessments. 
Hence,  drone 
cultivation  activities,  reduces  usage  of  scarce  human 
and other resources, stores data for future analysis and 
increases yields by effective resource usage. Farmers of 
Andhra Pradesh in India, for instance, have commenced 
offer agriculture survey services to insurance companies 
as well as the government to efficiently implement crop 
insurance 
schemes. 
In 
addition, 
advanced 
robotic 
systems, such as weeding robots, driverless tractors and 
soil  sterilisation  robots,  are  used  in  agriculture  fields 
for  supplying  inputs,  land  preparation,  weed  control, 
pruning,  seeding,  spraying, 
thinning,  harvesting  and 
picking, and sorting and packing. Therefore, drone and 
robot technologies support farmers for efficient resource 
management while reducing cost of production through 
reduced labour usage. 
Today, nanotechnology has grown into a mature field of 
science, and it has a wide variety of potential applications 
in  agriculture.  Nanotechnology  broadly  refers  to  a  field 
of  applied  science  and  technology  that  aims  to  control 
matter at the molecular level in scale, usually in the range 
of one to 100 nanometers, and create devices within that 
size range (ScienceDaily, 2020). Nanotechnology is used 
in  all  stages  of  farm  activities  such  as  production,  value 
addition,  storage  and  packaging,  and  transportation  of 
agricultural  products.  The  application  of  nanomaterials, 
such as nanocapsules and nanoparticles, especially aims 
at  efficient  usage  of  plant  protection  products  through 
enhanced plant absorption and delivery of ingredients to 
specific  sites.  For  example,  fertiliser  applied  in  the  form 
of  nanomaterial  minimises  nutrient  losses  by  slow  and 
controlled release of substances, and thereby increases yield 
via optimised resource usage and reduces environmental","stage  of  crop  cultivation  as  well  as  weather  forecasts,
