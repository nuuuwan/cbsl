2.1 OverviewT

he growth of the Sri Lankan economy

moderated further to 2.3 per cent in

2019, compared to the growth of 3.3 per

cent in 2018, amidst the challenging domestic

environment, particularly following the Easter

Sunday attacks which slowed down the growth

reverberating adversely across most of the key

economic activities. The decade-long peaceful

environment in the country was shaken up by the

attacks, primarily devastating the tourism segment

which has many backward and forward linkages

to other key economic activities especially related

to Services and Industry. Reflecting the adverse

impact of the event, the Purchasing Managers

Indices compiled by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

(CBSL) recorded its historically lowest levels

in April and May. In this background, Services

activities expanded at a slower pace during the

year with the sluggishness in wholesale and

retail trade activities, personal services and

transportation activities. Further, Industry activities

recorded a moderate growth during the year

mainly supported by the recovery in construction

and mining activities. Meanwhile, Agricultural

activities recorded only a marginal growth during

the year with a decline in key activities including

fishing and growing of some major crops, mainly

due to weather related disturbances. Despite the

accommodative monetary policy stance adopted

by the CBSL with the view to stimulating economic

growth, investment expenditure dampened

further in 2019 mainly on account of tumbled

investor confidence with a dejected outlook

owing to policy and political uncertainty that

prevailed in the country. However, consumption

expenditure recorded a moderate growth in 2019.

A considerable improvement was witnessed in

net external demand in 2019, where the import

of goods and services grew marginally while

the export of goods and services expanded at

a higher rate buttressed by the policy measures

taken to curtail non-essential imports. Meanwhile,

domestic savings contracted at a higher rate.

Further, the net primary income from the rest of

the world in rupee terms continued to contract

during the year, while the net secondary income

(net current transfers) from the rest of the world

in rupee terms recorded a growth during the year.

Reflecting these developments, national savings

declined during the year while the resource gap

narrowed due to the contraction in investments.

GDP per capita was estimated at Rs. 688,719

in 2019, compared to Rs. 662,949 in 2018,

which is an increase of 3.9 per cent in 2019

in comparison to the increase of 6.7 per cent

in 2018. The slower growth in GDP per capita

in rupee terms was mainly on account of the

slowdown in GDP at current prices. Meanwhile,

per capita GDP in US dollar terms was US dollars

3,852 in 2019, in comparison to US dollars 4,079

in 2018, registering a decrease of 5.5 per cent,

compared to a marginal increase of 0.05 per

cent in 2018, due to the slower growth of GDP

at current prices, as well as the depreciation of

the domestic currency against the US dollar, on

an annual average basis.2

2 GDP per capita is calculated using annual average exchange rate.

GNI, which is derived by adjusting GDP

for the net primary income from the rest of

the world, increased to Rs. 14,583.9 billion at

current prices, recording a slower growth of

4.3 per cent in 2019, compared to the growth

of 7.7 per cent in 2018. This slowdown in GNI

was a combined outcome of the slower growth

in the GDP at current prices, and the negative

growth of 10.9 per cent in net primary income in

2019 compared to its contraction of 10.4 per cent

in 2018.

2.3 Contribution from

Institutional Sectors

The Household and Non-Profit Institutions

Serving Households (HH and NPISH) sector

continued to be the major contributor to the

Gross Value Added (GVA) of the economy at

current prices. Accordingly, the HH and NPISH

sector grew by 5.0 per cent in 2019, compared

to the growth of 7.7 per cent recorded in 2018,

accounting for 48.8 per cent of the GVA of the

economy in 2019. Being the second largest

contributor, the Non-Financial Corporations (NFC)

sector, accounted for 35.4 per cent of the GVA of

the economy, recording a growth of 7.9 per cent

in 2019 compared to its growth of 8.2 per cent in

2018. Meanwhile, the General Government (GG)

grew by 4.5 per cent and 8.4 per cent, respectively,

in 2019 compared to the respective growth rates

of 18.1 per cent and 8.2 per cent recorded in 2018.

Accordingly, the GG and FC sectors accounted

respectively for 10.2 per cent and 5.5 per cent of

the GVA of the economy.

Considering the contribution of institutional

sectors to the major economic activities at

current prices, the HH and NPISH sector

remained as the major contributor to the value

added of Agriculture and Services activities

in 2019 while the value added of Industry

activities was mainly driven by the NFC

sector. Accordingly, the HH and NPISH sector

contributed to 80.8 per cent of value added of

Agriculture activities indicating a slight decline in

its contribution compared to that of 81.4 per cent

in 2018. Further, 51.6 per cent of value added of

Services activities was generated by the HH and

NPISH sector in comparison to the contribution

of 51.8 per cent in 2018. Meanwhile, the NFC

sector contributed to 64.3 per cent of value added

of Industry activities in 2019 compared to its

contribution of 63.7 per cent recorded in 2018.

2.4 Output, Policies, Institutional Support and Issues

Agriculture

Agriculture activities recorded a marginal

growth of 0.6 per cent in 2019 in value added

terms, compared to the growth of 6.5 per cent in

2018, owing to the considerable decline in key

activities including fishing, forestry, and growing

of major crops such as rubber and tea. Further,

growing of cereals, spices, plant propagation and

support activities to agriculture, and growing of

other beverage crops such as coffee, cocoa etc.,

rice and other perennial crops also contracted,

deterring expansion in overall agriculture activities,

mainly on account of the unexpected weather

related disturbances that occurred during the year.

However, growing of oleaginous fruits (including

coconut), other fruits and vegetables, and animal

production expanded during the year fostering the

growth in agriculture activities. The slowdown in

valued added of agriculture related activities was

reflected in the sub-indices related to the Agriculture

segment of the Business Outlook Survey (BOS)

conducted by the Central Bank on a quarterly basis.

Accordingly, the Production sub-index of the BOS

on average recorded a deterioration during the year.

Introduction

Global demand for food is growing continuously as a result of population growth and dietary changes, and as per the World Population Prospects - 2019 of the United Nations, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050 from today’s 7.8 billion level. Rise in population brings a range of global sustainability issues, including food security. Sri Lanka, as a developing nation, faces similar concerns about food security amidst growing population, substantial postharvest losses and regular adverse weather shocks, and these challenges need to be tackled through efficient agriculture practices. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has also reiterated the importance of food security for a developing nation such as ours. Traditional agriculture, through the accumulation of farmers’ knowledge and experiences, managed to feed the entire population for many centuries in the past. The cascade tank-village system (Ellanga system), the hill side cascade paddy fields (Helmalu) and the irrigation systems developed in the historical past were remarkable agro-biodiversity systems in Sri Lanka with regard to water management efficiency, climate change adaptability and buffers against natural disasters such as floods, droughts and pest attacks. However, during the colonial period, priority was given to plantation agriculture and little attention was paid to other crop cultivations, except for subsistence farming. With little government attention, subsistence farming alone became insufficient to meet the growing food demand in the country. Subsequently, the green revolution, which was a major policy response of many developing nations in the 1960s, sought to increase the efficiency of agricultural processes through various techniques such as high yielding robust varieties, hybridised seeds, expansion of irrigation infrastructure, synthetic fertiliser, and pesticides. Although the agriculture sector has undergone considerable transformation and improvements in response to green revolution practices, productivity levels have been stagnant in recent years, raising concerns about food security as well as low farmer income. However, reverting back to the agro-ecosystem that is based on traditional agriculture practices is not feasible under the current context, since available resources for agriculture activities such as land and water resources have been diminishing rapidly owing to other industrial activities and urbanisation. Despite a significant share of the labour force employed in the sector, labour shortages have been increasingly common in relation to labour intensive cultivation activities. In addition, recent experiences of erratic weather patterns and resultant natural disasters, such as droughts and floods, tend to impose additional restrictions on agricultural activities. These trends emphasise the importance of improving productivity and efficient resource usage in the agriculture sector through innovative technologies.

BOX 4Adoption of Modern Technologies in Agriculture

Rapid technological advancements in the world over the last two decades have led to a variety of new innovations, which have the potential to address technological needs of farmers and other agriculture sector stakeholders much faster and with far more accuracy than ever before. Countries such as India, Israel and Brazil have experienced rapid transitions in the agriculture sector, with accelerated mechanisation and usage of advanced technologies. Although an array of new technological adoptions such as vertical farming, hydroponics, Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are available in Sri Lanka too, usage of these technologies is relatively limited. Therefore, Sri Lanka still has a long way to go to embrace new advanced technologies for farming activities as a norm.

New Technologies to Enhance the Performance of the Agriculture Sector

New advancements in technology, ranging from micro devices to macro networks, have completely transformed modern global agriculture in a productive way. Innovative agriculture techniques no longer depend on the application of inputs such as water, nutrients and crop protection substances equally to all fields. Given the limited resources available for agriculture production and the rising demand for agriculture products, precision or smart agriculture techniques have emerged, suggesting the application of a precise amount of agriculture inputs to crops by observing, gauging and responding to inter-field and intra-field variability in field conditions through the usage of a range of modern information and telecommunication technologies. Hence, smart farming concepts integrate modern technologies and current farming practices to increase the output and the quality of agricultural products.

Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), drones and robots can be effectively used for productivity improvements in the agriculture sector. Today, billions of physical devices, such as smartphones, computers and smart electronic appliances around the world are connected to the internet, gathering and sharing data. Incorporating sensors to this network of devices will add a certain level of digital intelligence to these devices, enabling them to communicate real-time data without any involvement of human beings (Ranger, 2020). This technology is known as IoT. IoT devices can be fixed in or on land, vehicle, water, plant and livestock to access data such as moisture content, nutrients availability in soil, pest and disease attacks, tracking of vehicles, storage capacity, livestock monitoring, and other farm operations. The data collected is processed and analysed using AI to generate usable information, which can be easily accessed by farmers and other stakeholders via computers or mobile phones. AI, which uses machine learning techniques, can

2

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE AND INCOME

61

be used to analyse a range of data such as temperature, moisture, weather conditions, water usage and other field conditions collected at farm level on a real time basis. For instance, a moisture sensor and irrigation system augmented with AI can determine the exact water requirement of a crop based on soil moisture level, stage of crop cultivation as well as weather forecasts, and enable the irrigation of the field accordingly without human intervention. For instance, in Nigeria, the Hello Tractor IoT service connects tractor owners who wish to hire their tractor with farmers, with the aim of sharing resources and fully utilising available tractors. Moreover, food supply chain inefficiencies indicate a disconnection between supplier and retailer in the sector. Blockchain technology creates a direct link between all participants in the supply chain, ensuring efficiency, traceability and transparency at each stage of the production process. For example, the government of Thailand has introduced a pilot project to use blockchain traceability solutions for organic rice, particularly to track and trace Thailand’s jasmine rice from production to export. In the sequence of technological developments, drones and automated robots have emerged as versatile technologies for smart farming activities. Drone technology is used for soil and field analysis, planting, crop spraying, crop monitoring and analysis, irrigation, and crop health assessments. Hence, drone technology facilitates time saving in cultivation activities, reduces usage of scarce human and other resources, stores data for future analysis and increases yields by effective resource usage. Farmers of Andhra Pradesh in India, for instance, have commenced using drones to spray their farms with required pesticides. Further, private tech companies in India use drones to offer agriculture survey services to insurance companies as well as the government to efficiently implement crop insurance schemes. In addition, advanced robotic systems, such as weeding robots, driverless tractors and soil sterilisation robots, are used in agriculture fields for supplying inputs, land preparation, weed control, pruning, seeding, spraying, thinning, harvesting and picking, and sorting and packing. Therefore, drone and robot technologies support farmers for efficient resource management while reducing cost of production through reduced labour usage.

Today, nanotechnology has grown into a mature field of science, and it has a wide variety of potential applications in agriculture. Nanotechnology broadly refers to a field of applied science and technology that aims to control matter at the molecular level in scale, usually in the range of one to 100 nanometers, and create devices within that size range (ScienceDaily, 2020). Nanotechnology is used in all stages of farm activities such as production, value addition, storage and packaging, and transportation of agricultural products. The application of nanomaterials, such as nanocapsules and nanoparticles, especially aims at efficient usage of plant protection products through enhanced plant absorption and delivery of ingredients to specific sites. For example, fertiliser applied in the form of nanomaterial minimises nutrient losses by slow and controlled release of substances, and thereby increases yield via optimised resource usage and reduces environmental

costs by preventing over usage of fertiliser. Moreover, nanotechnology is also explored in the fields of soil fertility improvement, crop disease diagnosis and control, seed coating, herbicide applications, livestock medicines as well as plant breeding and genetic transformation.

Postharvest losses result in lower supply of food to consumers and high retail prices. Hence, postharvest technologies play a critical role in maintaining the quality of food, extending the shelf life of perishables and reducing food losses. Postharvest loss management requires careful handling of goods from the time of harvest until they reach the market. In addition to cold storage, numerous postharvest technologies such as chemical treatments (applying antioxidants, anti-browning and antimicrobial chemicals) and physical treatments (radiation, heat and edible coatings) are regularly used in food supply chains. The purpose of these technologies is to slow down food quality deterioration due to physiological processes and maturation while minimising the risk of microbial growth and contamination. In addition to the application of postharvest treatments, improved packaging techniques also help to reduce postharvest losses at different stages of the food value chain such as storage and transportation. Active packaging that incorporates oxygen and ethylene absorbers will slow down physiological processes in food, thereby extending their shelf life. Meanwhile, intelligent packaging that incorporates sensors, indicators and radio frequency identification systems are increasingly used in monitoring food quality and package integrity. Further, genetic experts have developed plant strains that are resistant to some of the postharvest changes.

Efficient exchange of farm knowledge is a crucial prerequisite for smart farming. Farmers and related stakeholders require the latest information on the most effective planting practices, best prices in the markets, available credit supply, soil conditions, nutrients and plant protection. Moreover, early warnings on drought and flood conditions, pest and disease outbreaks, and forest fire are sought by farmers on a frequent basis. Electronic extension programmes can be used to disseminate such information and alerts to stakeholders through digital technologies. Instead of always physically contacting the farmers, extension agents could use a combination of voice, text, videos, and internet methods to contact farmers frequently in a more cost effective manner given the increasing mobile phone usage by farmers. For example, the AgroStar tech platform in India offers a wide range of agronomy advice coupled with agricultural inputs and services to farmers to increase their productivity and quality of produce while solving common problems occurring in farming activities. Currently, AgroStar operates in the Indian states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan, linking over 500,000 farmers on its digital platform. Meanwhile, Kenya Agricultural Commodity Exchange (KACE) has introduced a short messaging service (SMS) called 'SMS SOKONI' and farmers from anywhere in the country can access current and reliable market information on prices and offers via SMS or a mobile phone App at subsidised service charges. The data-driven digital

2

technologies have shifted the agriculture sector from more production centric activities to market centric activities in view of balancing production and market demand conditions.

Current Status of New Technology Adoption in Sri Lanka

Advanced technology usage in the Sri Lankan agriculture sector is limited, not only among the farmers, but also among the agribusinesses. With the aim of using Information Communication Technology for productivity improvements in the agriculture sector, several e-agriculture programmes such as interactive ICT and mobile platforms and software applications have been already developed to disseminate agriculture information. Few e-agriculture services such as the Wikigoviya web, AgMIS (an SMS service and market price information system), Boga Purokathanaya (a mobile phone App that provides advice to farmers on crops that should be cultivated to receive a better market price), SL paddy fertiliser (a mobile phone App that provides fertiliser recommendations to farmers) and Govipola (a mobile phone App that supports the farming community by strengthening market linkages, improving price awareness and matching supply and demand to give easy access to markets) are currently in operation in Sri Lanka, as initiatives of the Department of Agriculture and several private institutions. Meanwhile, a seed and planting material management information system, a QR code system for GAP certification, and a progress monitoring system for the National Food Production programme are currently being developed. In addition, the Sri Lanka Institute of Nanotechnology (SLINTEC) is carrying out numerous nanotechnology related research and development activities to produce slow-release fertiliser, nanofungicidal formulations, organic acid based weedicides, seed coating to reduce negative effects of fertiliser, and improve soil remediation and rehabilitation. Further, numerous private tech companies in Sri Lanka have also initiated several technological solutions to agricultural matters, such as drone technology and smart weather solutions (e.g. WeatherGuru). Amidst restrictions imposed on movement of people and gatherings during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, smart technologies and social media have been put to use increasingly to support the agriculture supply chain, linking wholesalers, retailers and end consumers. In the same vein, smart technologies can be effectively used to link agriculture producers with markets to manage harvesting periods, reduce postharvest losses and wastage and ensure better price realisation for the farming community.

However, research and development initiatives of Sri Lanka’s private sector in relation to advanced agriculture technologies are still limited to a few pioneering companies and a broad based use is yet to be realised. Further, agriculture firms as well as farmers in Sri Lanka appear to adopt new technologies slower than expected, and farms are investing in productivity enhancing technology at a slower pace as they are sheltered from

competition. Concerns over the adaptability of new technologies, limited capital to make initial investment required to make the transition to high tech agriculture, lack of technical education and skills, reluctance of tech-savvy youth to engage in farming activities have resulted in slow-paced technological adoption by agriculture firms and the farming community. The availability and speed of internet connections in rural areas and lack of awareness of available services also limit smart technology usage by farmers.

Way Forward

The Sri Lankan agriculture sector has undergone a considerable transformation in terms of all farming activities, over time. However, further progress towards technology-oriented agriculture, with the aim of enhancing agricultural value chains, is crucial for the next level of development and to tackle emerging challenges in the agriculture sector. Identifying sectoral and grassroots level limitations of technology adoption will help mitigate constraints in transformation from conventional practices to tech-based agriculture. Policy reforms on capital allocation for technology transformation and technical education as well as strengthening digital infrastructure are important, thereby addressing persistent structural obstacles that deter technological adoption in the sector. Increased public investment in research and development activities through the numerous agriculture related research organisations in the country for data-driven, smart tech-based agriculture practices and creating a conducive investment environment for the private sector to invest in such activities, and increased access to credit at concessional rates are vital to boost technology innovations in the agriculture sector. In addition, increasing awareness on available services and enhancing access to concessional loans to support farmer level investments are also critical to address constraints for technological adoption at the grassroots level. In the medium to long run, introducing subjects related to advanced agriculture technologies to curricula of technical and tertiary education programmes is also essential to promote technology adoption in the agriculture sector. At the same time, it is appropriate to revisit Sri Lanka’s historical agriculture systems, in view of integrating best practices of such systems with modern technology as far as possible, in order to enhance the resilience and eco-friendliness of the agriculture practices.

Agriculture Production

The Agriculture Production Index, which

measures the output of the agriculture and

fisheries sectors, broadly remained unchanged

recording a growth of 0.03 per cent in 2019,

compared to a growth of 11.0 per cent in

2018. Within the index, the sub indices of paddy,

coconut and livestock increased, while tea, rubber

and other crops (vegetables, fruits and other field

crops) sub indices declined in comparison to the

previous year. Meanwhile, a contraction in fisheries

activities was also recorded during the year.

Paddy

Paddy production in 2019 grew notably with

a bumper harvest recorded during the 2018/19

Maha season. Accordingly, paddy production

increased by 16.9 per cent in 2019 in comparison

to the previous year, to 4.6 million metric tons.

The net extent of land harvested during the year

increased by 8.3 per cent to 957,596 hectares,

while the overall average paddy yield increased

to 4,795 kilogrammes per hectare in 2019 from

4,443 kilogrammes per hectare in 2018. This

increase in paddy yield in 2019 was an outcome

of the growth in the 2018/19 Maha production,

amidst a decline in production in the Yala season.

Paddy production in the 2018/19 Maha season

amounted to 3.0 million metric tons and it was

a 28.2 per cent growth over the production

in the previous Maha season. The 2018/19

Maha season production was the highest paddy

production recorded in the country over the last

four decades. The considerable increase in the

Maha production can be partly attributed to both

higher yield per hectare and increased extent of

land sown in major paddy producing areas, owing

to favourable rainfall experienced during the latter

part of 2018. The extent harvested during the

2018/19 Maha season increased considerably

by 16.2 per cent to 647,243 hectares. The paddy

yield per hectare during the 2018/19 Maha season

increased by 10.3 per cent to 4,747 kilogrammes,

from 4,302 kilogrammes in the corresponding

season of the previous year. Meanwhile, paddy

production during the 2019 Yala season declined

marginally by 0.9 per cent to 1.5 million metric tons

compared to that of the 2018 Yala season, largely

due to drought conditions and pest attacks in

major producing areas. As a result, the land extent

harvested during the 2019 Yala season decreased

by 5.2 per cent to 310,353 hectares. However, the

paddy yield per hectare during the 2019 Yala season

increased by 4.5 per cent to 4,896 kilogrammes,

from 4,683 kilogrammes in the corresponding Yala

season in 2018. The annual paddy production of

both Maha and Yala seasons, which was equivalent

to 2.9 million metric tons of rice, was estimated to be

adequate to meet the domestic demand for rice for

approximately 14 months.

Paddy prices in the open market remained

low during the first half of the year, although

they showed an increasing trend during the

second half. The guaranteed paddy purchasing

price for Samba and Nadu varieties were

Rs. 41.00 per kilogramme and Rs. 38.00

per kilogramme, respectively, in 2019. Farmgate

prices of paddy were low in the first half of the year

supported by the increased paddy supply from the

2018/19 Maha season. However, prices of all paddy

varieties escalated in most of the paddy producing

areas during the latter part of 2019, largely due to

increased purchases of paddy by private millers at

competitive prices in the open market and the limited

supply of paddy during the 2019 Yala season. Overall,

the average price of Samba paddy decreased to

Rs. 42.78 per kilogramme in 2019 from Rs. 51.04

per kilogramme in 2018, while the average price

of Nadu paddy recorded an increase to Rs. 43.01

per kilogramme in 2019 from Rs. 40.17 per kilogramme

in 2018. In line with the movements of paddy prices,

the average retail prices of Samba rice decreased by

6.4 per cent to Rs. 102.29 per kilogramme, whereas

the average retail price of Nadu rice increased by

1.7 per cent to Rs. 93.48 per kilogramme during the

year. With the bumper harvest, the importation of rice

in 2019 declined significantly by 90.3 per cent from

the last year. Accordingly, the quantum of rice imports

in 2019 dropped to 24,193 metric tons from 248,901

metric tons imported during the previous year.

However, towards the end of the year, a shortage in

supply of rice from the private sector to the market

caused an increase in retail rice prices. Therefore,

the government took measures to stabilise rice

prices by milling approximately 40,000 metric tons

of paddy stocks, which were stored in the granaries

of the Paddy Marketing Board and provided rice to

the market through Lanka Sathosa Ltd. Moreover,

the Cabinet of Ministers decided to fix a maximum

retail price for Samba rice and Nadu rice at Rs. 98.00

per kilogramme with a view to preventing rice millers

and traders earning exorbitant profits at the expense

of the consumers. However, the maximum retail price

was not applicable for special varieties of rice, such

as Keeri Samba and Suduru Samba.

Tea

The downward trend in tea production that

was observed since 2017, continued in 2019

as well, primarily due to domestic factors.

Tea production in 2019 declined by 1.3 per cent to

300.1 million kilogrammes, owing to labour issues

that emerged during wage negotiations in the

sector, dry weather conditions that prevailed in

the first half of the year as well as heavy rains in

the fourth quarter. Accordingly, high grown tea

production reported a decline of 3.0 per cent to

63.1 million kilogrammes, while the medium grown

tea output increased marginally by 0.1 per cent to

47.2 million kilogrammes. Low grown teas, which

account for around 62 per cent of the total output,

declined by 1.0 per cent in 2019 to 189.9 million

kilogrammes. The average yield in the smallholder

sector was generally higher than that in the

large plantation sector, reflecting the potential

for increasing the yield by replanting and infilling

old plantations with high yielding tea plants and

applying good agricultural practices.

Despite the reduction in output, the

quantity of tea traded at the Colombo auction

as well as the amount exported increased in

2019. However, the average export price (FOB)

of tea decreased by 9.1 per cent to US dollars 4.6

per kilogramme in 2019, compared to US dollars

5.1 per kilogramme recorded in 2018. Meanwhile,

the annual average price at the Colombo Tea

Auction (CTA) declined by 6.0 per cent to

Rs. 546.67 per kilogramme from Rs. 581.58 per

kilogramme reported in 2018. The highest year-

on-year decrease in tea prices at the CTA was

observed for high grown tea (10.9 per cent),

followed by medium grown tea (10.0 per cent)

and low grown tea (3.6 per cent). In order to

increase earnings from tea exports, it is essential

to enhance value addition in the sector, improve

warehousing and packaging facilities as well as

quality assurance throughout the value chain up

to the consumer. Building direct linkages with

foreign buyers by developing producers’ own

brand names will ensure better prices and a stable

market for tea producers.

Rubber

Rubber production, which has been on a

declining trend in recent years, further reduced

by 9.5 per cent to 74.8 million kilogrammes

in 2019, reporting the lowest annual output

in history. This decline was reflected in both

smallholder and plantation sectors, and was mainly

driven by disruptions to tapping operations due to

rainy weather conditions in the latter part of the year

and abandonment of tapping operations due to low

remunerative prices. The decline was reflected by

a significant drop in the production of sheet rubber,

which accounts for about a 50 per cent share of

total rubber production. Accordingly, sheet rubber

production declined by 9.5 per cent to 37.4 million

kilogrammes from 41.3 million kilogrammes in 2018.

Crepe rubber production also recorded a marginal

decline of 0.5 per cent to 14.4 million kilogrammes.

Production of other categories of rubber, which

accounts for around 30 per cent of total rubber

production, declined by 14.3 per cent to 22.9 million

kilogrammes, in comparison to the previous year’s

production of 26.8 million kilogrammes.

Lower output in the rubber sector during

2019 in turn reduced the volume exported.

Accordingly, natural rubber exports of Sri

Lanka declined by 7.0 per cent to 13.0 million

kilogrammes in 2019 in comparison to the

previous year. Domestic consumption of rubber

in the industrial sector, which decreased over

the last few years, further declined by 16.8

per cent to 113 million kilogrammes due to the

subdued performance of the rubber related

domestic manufacturing sector. Meanwhile,

the cost of production of rubber increased by

2.4 per cent to Rs. 210.00 per kilogramme in 2019.

However, average prices of Ribbed Smoked Sheet

No. 1 (RSS1) and latex crepe were Rs. 288.51

per kilogramme and Rs. 302.32 per kilogramme,

respectively, at the Colombo Rubber Auction,

2

66

resulting in lower profit margins, which discouraged

tapping operations and further investments in

rubber plantations by producers. Both international

and domestic demand for natural rubber was

low under the slowing down of global economic

activities and relatively low petroleum prices.

During the year, natural rubber imports dropped by

24.0 per cent to 50.0 million kilogrammes, although

synthetic rubber imports increased by 2.1 per cent

to 64.0 million kilogrammes owing to relatively low

global crude oil prices.

Coconut

Coconut production in 2019, estimated at

3,085.6 million nuts, was an improvement of

17.6 per cent over the output in 2018.

The increase in output is attributed to the

lagged effect of favourable rainfall in 2018

reported in the coconut triangle and other

coconut growing areas. In line with increased

nut production, the production of major

coconut based products also showed an

improvement. Accordingly, the production of

desiccated coconut (DC), which reported a

16.7 per cent decrease in the previous year,

rebounded considerably with an increase of

79.0 per cent to 44,081 metric tons. Coconut

oil production also increased by 309.2

per cent to 44,648 metric tons while virgin coconut

oil production increased by 2.8 per cent to

12,725 metric tons in 2019. Accordingly, the

importation of palm oil declined significantly to

155,997 metric tons in 2019 from 217,730 metric

tons in 2018. Meanwhile, improved coconut

production helped expand the value added

industries in 2019, including coconut cream,

coconut milk powder and coconut milk, which are

mainly produced for the export market, recording a

5.8 per cent growth in comparison to the previous

year.

Coconut prices at the Colombo Coconut

Auctions (CCA) remained low during 2019

compared to the previous year, due to the

increase in supply. The average auction price

of coconut at the CCA declined to Rs. 27.55

per nut in 2019 from Rs. 45.55 per nut in 2018,

while the average retail price of coconut in 2019

declined to Rs. 50.64 per nut by 27.4 per cent

compared to the preceding year. The decline

in prices was observed with respect to other

coconut products as well. Accordingly, the average

price of coconut oil decreased by 8.0 per cent to

Rs. 260.16 per 750 ml bottle while the average

local market price of desiccated coconut decreased

to Rs. 251.03 per kilogramme in 2019 from

Rs. 378.22 per kilogramme in 2018. Meanwhile, DC

exporters were able to harness the full benefits of

increased domestic production, as reflected by the

154.7 per cent growth in DC exports during 2019.

Minor Export Crops

The production of minor export crops

recovered in 2019, despite the adverse weather

conditions that prevailed during the year.

According to the provisional estimates of the

Department of Export Agriculture, the production

of minor export crops increased by 6.0 per cent

in 2019, compared to the decline of 12.3 per cent

recorded in 2018. The production of clove, cocoa,

arecanut, nutmeg and mace registered a growth in

2019, while the production of pepper, cinnamon,

cardamom and citronella declined. Accordingly,

clove production grew by 42.4 per cent to 4,786

metric tons. Further, production of cocoa grew

by 32.7 per cent to 548 metric tons, and nutmeg

and mace production grew by 22.5 per cent to

5,119 metric tons. Meanwhile, farmgate prices of

pepper decreased by 11.6 per cent to Rs. 517.60

per kilogramme during the year continuing its

declining trend, reflecting the low global demand in

2019. Mainly due to the prolonged drought during

the flowering and fruiting seasons, the pepper

harvest also declined by 1.8 per cent in comparison

to the previous year. Moreover, the production

of cinnamon marginally decreased by 0.2 per

cent to 20,352 metric tons in 2019 from 20,398

metric tons in 2018. Further, the decline in prices

also discouraged the farmers, resulting in a national

dialogue on minor export crops. Meanwhile,

the export volumes of clove, nutmeg and mace

increased while export volumes of pepper,

cardamom and coffee declined in 2019, resulting in

a 1.7 per cent decline in total earnings from minor

export crops. Erratic rain patterns remained a

challenge for the minor export crops sector creating

low yields and post harvest losses. The promotion

of value addition in the minor export agriculture

sector should be a strategic priority to address the

challenges posed by rising costs of production and

to capture higher share in the international market.

Other Field Crops

According to the provisional estimates

of the Department of Census and Statistics,

production of other field crops (OFCs)

registered a decline owing to the impact of

the adverse weather conditions and pest

attacks during 2019. The production of OFCs,

at 545,358 metric tons, declined by 10.1 per cent

as a combined result of a 13.9 per cent decline

in production during the 2018/19 Maha season

and a marginal decline of 1.0 per cent in the 2019

Yala season. Maize production declined by 9.0

per cent to 245,647 metric tons in 2019, mainly due

to heavy crop damages recorded in the 2018/19

Maha season caused by adverse weather and

the Sena caterpillar (Fall Armyworm) infestation.

Further, big onion production decreased by 35.7

per cent from 28,047 metric tons in 2018 to 18,022

metric tons in 2019. This was mainly due to the

decline in average yield by around 4 per cent to 20

metric tons per hectare in 2019 and the considerable

decline of 36.2 per cent in land extent cultivated.

Meanwhile, the importation of big onion decreased

by 2.5 per cent to 240,102 metric tons during

2019 owing to restrictions imposed by India on

big onion exports, resulting in an escalation of big

onion prices in the local market. However, potato

production increased considerably during 2019

by 14.3 per cent to 101,642 metric tons compared

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

68

to 88,897 metric tons produced in 2018. This can

be attributed to the increase in the extent of land

cultivated by 8.4 per cent to 5,610 hectares in

2019. In line with the increased domestic supply,

the importation of potatoes also decreased by 10.5

per cent during the year. Further, the production

of finger millet, black gram, gingerly, chillies, red

onions, ground nuts, cowpea and green gram also

decreased significantly, resulting in considerable

price fluctuations in the latter part of the year,

which emphasises the importance of enhancing

commercial scale agriculture with proper cultivation

plans to ensure domestic food security.

Vegetables

Supply of vegetables declined in 2019

owing to pest damages and extreme weather

conditions. The total vegetable production declined

considerably by 11.8 per cent to 1,497,733 metric

tons in 2019, in comparison to 1,698,698 metric

tons in 2018. This decline was mainly due to the

lower production of vegetables in 2018/19 Maha

season, which recorded a decline of 15.2 per cent

over the previous Maha season, caused by the Fall

Armyworm infestation and prolonged dry weather

conditions in the early part of the year. Vegetable

production during the 2018/19 Maha season was

also affected by the decline in the extent of land used

for vegetable cultivation, following increased paddy

cultivation in the 2018/19 Maha season. Meanwhile,

2019 Yala production also declined by 7.1 per cent,

as a result of heavy rainy weather conditions in

the fourth quarter of the year. Responding to the

reduced vegetable supply in the Maha season,

both upcountry and low country vegetable prices

increased in May 2019. The vegetable cultivation

in the intermediate season also declined due to

weather related setbacks. Accordingly, frequent

price fluctuations were observed in the third quarter

of the year though the vegetable supply from the

Northern Province helped reduce price pressures

in the vegetable market. However, towards the end

of the year, vegetable prices increased once again

following the seasonal price patterns, amplified by

crop damages and interruptions of supplies caused

by heavy rains. Further, 23,957 metric tons of

vegetables with a value of US dollars 32.0 million

were exported in 2019. Regular supply disruptions

and price fluctuations highlight the necessity of policy

measures to promote Good Agricultural Practices

(GAP), enhance cold storage facilities, popularise

improved technologies on crop cultivation and

improve post harvest handling and processing, with

the aim of increasing the efficiency of the sector.

Fruits

The production of fruits declined in 2019

owing to drought weather conditions. Fruit

production recorded a decline of 3.1 per cent in

2019, against the notable growth of 28.8 per cent

in the previous year. More specifically, mango,

plantain and avocado production decreased

considerably while orange, melon, papaw,

passion fruit and pineapple production reported

a growth. Sri Lanka imported 68,602 metric tons

of fresh fruit, incurring a cost of US dollars 75.7

million during 2019. This is a 12.9 per cent decline

in imported volume over the quantity imported in

2018. As in the preceding year, apples, oranges

and grapes were the main varieties of fresh fruit

imported. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka exported 38,896

metric tons of fresh fruit worth US dollars 41.1

million during 2019. Post harvest losses of the

sector are estimated at around 30 - 40 per cent,

which emphasise the importance of preserving

fruit by means of agro-cold warehousing, canning

and dehydration. Although a favourable export

demand exists for local fruits, the inability to

supply large quantities on a continuous basis

remains a constraint. Maintaining forward and

2

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE AND INCOME

69

backward linkages with the stakeholders and

further development of contract farming system

are important to improve the fruit export market.

Sugar

Recovering from its slowdown witnessed in

the previous year, sugar production increased

by 2.3 per cent to 52,304 metric tons in 2019.

Despite dry weather conditions and White Leaf

disease outbreak, sugar factories were able to

expand planting activities of the out growers,

resulting in an increased level of production in

2019. The Gal Oya and Sevanagala factories

contributed to the growth in production, while sugar

production at the Pelwatta factory declined. The

Gal Oya factory which reported 34.3 per cent

contraction in production in 2018, rebounded with

a growth of 33.3 per cent to 11,129 metric tons in

2019. The Sevanagala factory, recorded a growth

of 8.9 per cent, from 14,709 metric tons in 2018 to

16,013 metric tons in 2019. Despite the increased

availability of sugarcane for crushing at both Gal Oya

and Sevanagala factories, the production increased

mainly through improved sugar recovery rates3 in

2019. The Pelwatta factory, which accounted for

48.1 per cent of total sugar production in 2019,

reported a 10.3 per cent contraction to 25,162 metric

tons in 2019, in comparison to 28,061 metric tons

in 2018. The decline in production can be partially

attributed to the limited availability of sugarcane for

crushing, caused by the reduced quantity of private

cane purchased. During 2019, the total extent of

sugarcane cultivation (including ratoons) managed

by factories increased by 9.6 per cent to 12,300

hectares. Meanwhile, the average sugar recovery

rate for all sugar factories increased from 7.1

per cent in 2018 to 7.2 per cent in 2019. Further,

the combined volume of sugarcane harvested in

all factories increased by 5.8 per cent to 600,130

3 Sugar Recovery Rate = Sugar Production x 100 Quantity of Cone Crushed

metric tons during 2019, owing to the improved

average yield as well as the extent harvested.

However, the supply of sugarcane to the factories

by private cultivators reported a considerable

decrease of 6.1 per cent to 171,174 metric tons in

2019. Recognising the vast potential of increasing

sugar production through sugarcane cultivation of

out growers, all sugar factories accorded a high

priority to the expansion of existing out grower

schemes. Meanwhile, imports of sugar decreased

by 13.7 per cent to 556,270 metric tons in 2019

from 644,675 metric tons in 2018. Domestic sugar

production was sufficient to meet around eight per

cent of the total sugar demand4 of the country in

2019, in comparison to nine per cent in 2018.

Livestock

The total national milk production declined

in 2019, mainly due to the domestic outbreak

of foot and mouth disease during the second

half of the year. Milk production decreased by 6.3

per cent to 448 million litres in 2019 in comparison to

the growth of 20.5 per cent recorded in the previous

year. Cow milk production declined by 4.5 per cent

to 374 million litres, while buffalo milk production

declined by 14.4 per cent to 73.6 million litres.

Moreover, the number of neat milking cows declined

by 1.8 per cent to 323,490 while the number of buffalo

milking cows declined by 2.6 per cent to 91,790.

Meanwhile, milk production at the National Livestock

Development Board (NLDB) decreased to 13.1 million

litres in 2019 from 14.7 million litres in 2018, while

the milk collection at MILCO (Pvt) Ltd. decreased by

27.5 per cent to 66.0 million litres. The national

average cost of production of milk increased by

7.2 per cent to Rs. 51.11 per litre in 2019 from

Rs. 47.67 per litre recorded in the preceding year.

However, the average farm gate price increased

only by 4.6 per cent to Rs. 69.96 per litre, resulting

in a lower profit margin for farmers. Meanwhile,

the import of milk powder, at US dollars 293.5

million, reported a decline of 5.3 per cent to 93,749

metric tons. Since the domestic production of milk

is sufficient only to meet around 38 per cent of the

national requirement, it is vital to encourage domestic

production further, while addressing the remaining

bottlenecks in domestic production processes. In

addition, small scale milk processing should be

encouraged as the output of such producers is

important, probably when the price of powdered milk

increases in the international market. Meanwhile,

the poultry sector showed an improved performance

in 2019. Chicken production increased by 5.0

per cent to 225,000 metric tons in 2019. The number

of broiler parents production increased by 9.4

per cent in 2019 over the previous year, while

imports of broiler parents declined by 25.3 per cent

to 286,707 in 2019, compared to 383,930 imports

reported in 2018. Meanwhile, the import of layer

parents also increased to 94,811, mainly due to

the high market demand. The cost of production

of chicken (dressed) also increased to Rs. 314.30

per kilogramme in 2019 from Rs. 265.85

per kilogramme in 2018. Further, egg production

increased by 5.7 per cent to 2,084 million, while the

cost of production increased to Rs. 13.70 per egg in

2019 from Rs. 12.80 per egg in 2018 for a large-scale

egg producer. The import of poultry meat declined in

2019 while the export of eggs increased compared

to the previous year, displaying the potential for the

expansion of the poultry industry. The production

of pork and mutton increased by 7.8 per cent and

15.3 per cent, respectively, to 11,240 metric tons

and 1,880 metric tons, respectively. Meanwhile,

beef production declined by 5.5 per cent to

29,990 metric tons.

Fisheries

According to the Ministry of Fisheries and

Aquatic Resources, fish production in 2019

declined by 4.0 per cent. The decline in fish

production was partly due to the decline in marine

fish production, which consists of the coastal and

lagoon and deep sea fish production and accounts

for around 82 per cent of the total fish production.

The contraction in marine output was primarily driven

by the deep sea category, which declined by 9.2

per cent to 172,910 metric tons, owing to disturbances

to fishing activities due to frequent cyclonic conditions

in the Indian Ocean. Accordingly, several multi

day fishing trips were cancelled based on weather

warnings. Moreover, output in the coastal and lagoon

sub sector also declined by 2.6 per cent to 242,580

metric tons. Meanwhile, output of the inland fisheries

and aquaculture sector, which accounted for around

18 per cent of total production, increased by

3.0 per cent, mainly due to the stocking of fingerlings

in reservoirs despite adverse weather conditions

and the implementation of management regulations.

During the year, around 89 million fingerlings were

stocked in water bodies. Meanwhile, the production

in aquaculture sub category also increased during

the period under review. Nevertheless, the shrimp

farm category witnessed a considerable decline

of 21.8 per cent to 6,400 metric tons mainly due

to the white spot syndrome disease reported in

many shrimp farms. Meanwhile, according to the

Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, total

fish imports increased by 13.2 per cent to 95,637

metric tons. During the year under review, dried or

salted fish imports increased by 16.8 per cent to

37,590 metric tons, while canned fish imports also

increased considerably by 31.1 per cent to 36,806

metric tons. In response to a drop in production,

prices of large fish varieties increased by 6.8

per cent and small fish varieties increased by 20.2

per cent during the year. Meanwhile, fish exports

witnessed an increase of 11.5 per cent to Rs. 53,483

million in terms of value, while registering a growth of

2.8 per cent in terms of volume to 28,771 metric tons

during 2019. In the meantime, earnings from exports

of ornamental fish were Rs. 2,913 million during the

period under review. Sri Lanka needs to improve

the handling and packing of ornamental fish in order

to increase its export market share. In this regard,

regional connectivity needs to be improved further

to reduce the time taken for domestic transportation

of ornamental fish to ports, while supporting the local

packaging manufacturers.

Agriculture Policies and Institutional Support

Several policy measures were implemented

in 2019 with a view to increasing output in the

agriculture sector. During the year, agriculture

policy mainly focused on enhancing food

security, ensuring environmental sustainability

and developing climate resilient agriculture.

Accordingly, the paddy production programme

under the National Food Production Programme

was carried out with the aim of increasing

the average yield while implementing several

measures to produce high quality paddy seeds

and popularising new technologies and machinery

among farmers. Meanwhile, the paddy purchase

programme by the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB)

continued during 2019 with the PMB purchasing

larger quantities of paddy than in 2018 to stabilise

prices amidst healthy levels of paddy supplies in the

market. Further, the fertiliser subsidy programme

also continued in 2019. However, estimates on

the stock of paddy purchased by the PMB and

the quantity of fertiliser issued in 2019 were not

available at the time of publication of this report.

The PMB needs to be further strengthened through

modernising and expanding its storage capacity

to enhance its contribution to stabilise the supply

at times of market price fluctuations. Further,

a carefully designed public stock management

system which will effectively determine the size

of stocks that need to be purchased together with

the composition of the stock, purchasing locations

and financing mechanism for purchases, should be

adopted to ensure remunerative prices for farmers

while minimising losses incurred by the PMB.

In this context, it is also important to promote public–

private partnerships (PPP) aimed at improving

storage and distribution facilities.

The strategies that were undertaken by the

government for the development of the tea

sector continued in 2019 aiming at improving

sectoral productivity as well as the value

addition and competitiveness of tea produced

in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the government initiated

preliminary discussions with stakeholders with the

view of preparing a six-year strategic plan for the

tea sector. Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Tea Board

(SLTB) continued its global tea promotion and

marketing activities in 2019. Under a special subsidy

scheme, the SLTB facilitated the participation of Sri

Lankan tea exporting companies in 27 international

trade fairs at a cost of Rs. 111.6 million, in 2019.

The registration and renewal of the Ceylon Tea

Lion Logo in Sri Lanka and other countries were

continued by the SLTB, and as at end 2019,

Lion Logo had been registered in 103 countries

around the world. Moreover, SLTB signed 41

agreements with 18 selected private sector

companies for the brand promotion subsidy scheme

project for the year 2018/2019. In order to improve

the standard of leaves, the SLTB continuously

directed tea factories to maintain the minimum

quality of green tea leaf (60 per cent immature

undamaged leaf) under their 'B Leaf 60' programme,

while imposing the Hazard Analysis Critical Control

Points (HACCP) quality certification as a mandatory

requirement for export processing warehouses. In

addition, the government took measures to amend tea

regulations in 2019. Accordingly, the Tea Research

Board Act was amended in June 2019, and actions

are being taken to amend the regulations including

the Sri Lanka Tea Board Act, Tea Control Act and

Tea Small Holding Development Act. Moreover, the

SLTB continued its subsidy programmes in 2019

in relation to tea planting. Accordingly, an extent of

172.7 hectares of tea lands was replanted under the

tea replanting subsidy scheme at a cost of Rs.25.4

million. Further, an infilling programme, a planting

operation to replace dead plants with robust plants,

which will provide a uniform cover leading to a

higher yield, was also carried out by increasing

the infilling subsidy per plant from Rs. 25 to

Rs. 100. Under the tea factory modernisation

scheme, a total of Rs. 17.1 million was granted to 22

tea factories. Meanwhile, a sum of Rs. 0.19 million

was granted to 20 factories under the model tea land

scheme. Further, Good Manufacturing Practices

(GMP) were promoted to maintain quality standards

at tea factories and warehouses. The tea sector of

the country is plagued with low productivity, high

cost of production, labour issues, low level of value

addition in exports, poor plucking practices and price

fluctuations in the global market. Further, various

malpractices of the tea growers and tea producers

resulted in the production of low quality tea with a

high percentage of refuse tea at the auction. The low

quality of certain tea products affects the entire value

chain of tea exports and reduces the competitiveness

of Sri Lanka in the global tea market. Therefore,

maintenance of quality and safety at all stages of

production, promotion of value added products

and adoption of technology are required to revive

the tea sector from its current subdued state while

enhancing the country’s competitiveness against

other tea producing countries.

Measures to promote the rubber industry

continued with the aim of increasing rubber

production to 200,000 metric tons by the year

2040. Productivity improvement and expansion of

rubber cultivation to non-traditional areas were the

main strategies implemented in 2019.The Rubber

Research Institute (RRI) continued its activities by

addressing the requirements of the growers and

rubber related product manufacturing industries.

Accordingly, the RRI developed demonstrative

models to educate stakeholders on GAP while

promoting low frequency harvesting systems

to reduce the cost of production. Smallholders

were assisted to increase land productivity

with troubleshooting activities and productivity

improvement options. It is important to further

popularise intercropping in rubber lands while

introducing new climate resistance high yield

rubber varieties to strengthen the rubber industry.

Several policy measures were introduced to

further strengthen the coconut sector in 2019.

A new system was initiated to register coconut

lands through a mobile application. Meanwhile,

the Coconut Research Institute (CRI) continued its

research and development activities towards the

development of the coconut sector. Accordingly,

productivity improvement through adaptation

to climate change was given a high priority. The

Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB) continued its

extension services during the period, and a special

programme for improving coconut production

through village based extension programmes was

carried out to enhance the knowledge on adopting

best practices in coconut cultivation. Moreover, the

Coconut Development Authority (CDA) supported

the small scale and the informal coconut sectors

by providing accessories, machines and tools,

awareness on business and financial management,

and conducting technology transfer programmes.

In 2019, the Department of Export Agriculture

(DEA) conducted several programmes to

improve the minor export agriculture sector in

the country. Accordingly, the DEA took several

measures to increase the market share for organic

spices and beverage crops at the world market by

encouraging organic cultivation, and promoting

GAP and GMP to assure the quality of Minor Export

Crop (MEC) products. The DEA also took steps to

enhance the usage of appropriate technology by

supporting processing facilities. As a mechanism

of promoting organic agriculture in MEC lands,

investment assistance was provided to growers to

convert their cultivations into organic agriculture

while the cost of organic certification was borne

by the DEA. Additionally, 50 per cent investment

assistance was provided by the DEA to encourage

the establishment of micro irrigation systems

to mitigate climatic hazards and to build fences

around the MEC lands to prevent crop damages

by animals. Further, the DEA also provided

investment assistance for processing machinery

and processing centres to improve the quality of the

production process and enhance the final product.

In line with the national agricultural policy,

the government undertook several measures

to increase agricultural productivity, ensure

sustainable agricultural development and

national food and nutrition security, popularise

improved technologies for agriculture, and

develop agro based industries. Several measures

were taken to combat the Fall Armyworm pest

outbreak and an integrated pest management

package was developed by considering information

on their biology/bionomics and behaviour. Further,

with the objective of enhancing food production

in the country, a general extension programme

was conducted covering paddy, other field crops,

vegetables and fruits sector. Accordingly, several

awareness programmes were conducted to educate

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

74

farmers and extension officers on early detection of

pests and control measures. Further, to improve OFC

production such as maize, big onion, green gram

and cowpea, certified seeds and drip irrigation were

popularised among farmers while promoting GAP

among stakeholders. Accordingly, three new maize

varieties with high average yield were released for

general cultivation. Further, certified seed paddy,

OFCs and vegetable seed production continued in

government seed farms and under contract growing

programme. Meanwhile, several measures were

taken to promote the exporting of GAP certified

products. In this regard, farmer training and officer

training programmes were conducted to enhance

awareness among farmers and officers on GAP.

The government took further measures

to enhance domestic production of sugar.

Accordingly, measures related to the establishment

of new sugar factories and expansion of sugarcane

growing lands were continued during the year.

Sugarcane has been named a major plantation crop

by the Cabinet of Ministers, and hence sugarcane

has also become entitled to receive incentives and

subsidies relevant to plantation crops. Further,

sugarcane cultivation was expanded in the

Kilinochchi District, mainly focusing on jaggery and

syrup production. Meanwhile, in order to ensure

the sustainability of the local sugar industry, the

Sugarcane Research Institute (SRI) carried out

several programmes including the adoption of pest

and disease management programmes by surveying

their incidence in commercial plantations. Hence, a

special programme was undertaken by the SRI in

collaboration with the Department of Agriculture to

manage the impact of the Fall Armyworm out break

on sugarcane. Further, the development and the

adoption of new recommendations such as the

application of organic fertiliser, growing resistant

varieties in disease-prone areas and introduction

of new weedicide formulations for effective control

of weeds were also carried out. In addition, the

transfer of sugarcane technologies to farmers and

industries was also undertaken throughout the

year.

The Department of Animal Production and

Health implemented several development

programmes including the livestock breeding

project to upgrade cattle population in Sri Lanka.

Institutional support was further strengthened to

promote the domestic dairy sector. Seven veterinary

offices were newly established and the construction

work related to a veterinary office at Hali Ela in the

Badulla District commenced during the period under

review. Meanwhile, 229,418 artificial inseminations

were continued in cattle and buffaloes in 2019

through divisional veterinary offices. Under the

‘heifer calf rearing project’, 16,042 heifer calves were

registered in 2019. Further, vaccination and disease

investigation programmes continued during the

year. Accordingly, 761,938 animals were immunised

against foot and mouth disease while the Mastitis

control programme was continued throughout the

year.

The government took several policy

measures to encourage compliance with

fishing practices and to strengthen the

sustainability, social responsibility and

economic equitability in the fisheries sector.

Actions were taken to control and prevent drug

peddling and human smuggling in accordance

with the international standards applicable

for deep sea fishing while eliminating illegal,

unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing.

In order to strengthen fishing activities, the

government took measures to construct and

upgrade several harbours and anchorages while

promoting the ‘Green Fishery Harbour’ concept.

Further, several steps were taken in collaboration

with the National Aquaculture Development

2

Authority (NAQDA), to increase inland fish and

aquaculture production, such as increasing stocks

of fish fingerlings and fresh-water prawn post

larvae, proper management of water bodies with

community participation and establishment of

community based mini-hatcheries during the year.

In this regard, the NAQDA stocked 65.91 million

fresh-water larvae and 88.50 million fingerlings in

water bodies. Moreover, the NAQDA continued its

sea cucumber production, sea bass production,

crab production, aquatic plants production and

marine ornamental fish breeding projects with the

participation of farmers and exporters, targeting

the export market while enhancing foreign

income earnings of the country. Further, several

schemes including the 'Wewak Samaga Gamak'

programme, the fisheries village housing and

livelihood development programme and lagoon

development programme continued during the

year to strengthen socio-economic conditions of

the fisheries community.

Industry

The value added of Industry activities grew

by 2.7 per cent in 2019 compared to the growth of

1.2 per cent recorded in 2018, mainly benefiting

from the recovery in construction, and mining

and quarrying activities which jointly accounts

for a significant share of Industry activities.

In the meantime, manufacturing activities recorded

a slower growth in 2019. Other Industry activities,

namely, electricity and gas related activities,

sewerage, waste treatment and disposal activities,

and water collection, treatment and supply

activities continued their positive developments

during the year. The Demand and Production sub-

indices of the BOS related to the Industry segment

also expanded on average, reflecting the growth

in Industry activities during the year.

Mining and Quarrying

Mining and quarrying activities grew by

2.8 per cent in 2019, in value added terms,

recovering from the contraction of 5.2 per cent

in 2018 with the revival of construction activities

which has backward linkages to mining and

quarrying activities. Mining and quarrying activities

consist of both gem mining as well as other mining

activities. With regard to gem mining activities, the

gem, diamond and jewellery exports volume index

increased by 14.4 per cent in 2019, compared to the

decline of 13.7 per cent in 2018, reflecting a revival in

gem mining activities during the year. With regard to

other mining activities, the recovery in construction

activities has stimulated the sand mining activities.

However, the completion of the land reclamation

works of the Colombo Port City development project

by January 2019 led to a slowdown in sand mining

activities during the year in comparison to 2018. The

mineral exports volume index declined at a slower

pace of 1.1 per cent in 2019, compared to the

decline of 5.9 per cent recorded in 2018. However,

production of phosphate recorded only a marginal

growth compared to the previous year reflecting the

lower demand for fertiliser following the slowdown

in Agriculture activities. In the meantime, graphite

production recorded a decline during the year.

Manufacturing

The value added of manufacturing activities

grew at a slower pace of 1.9 per cent in 2019,

compared to the growth of 3.6 per cent recorded

in 2018, owing to headwinds that emanated from

the domestic front. The Easter Sunday attacks

adversely affected the growth in manufacturing

activities, particularly during the second quarter

of the year and the impact faded away during the

following quarters. The considerable contraction

recorded in manufacturing of rubber and plastic

products, wood, products of wood and cork except

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

76

furniture, basic metals and fabricated metal products,

and manufacturing of paper products, printing and

reproduction of media products during the year

largely led to a slowdown in overall manufacturing

activities in 2019. However, food, beverages and

tobacco products and, textile, wearing apparel and

leather related products, which are the two largest

sub-activities related to manufacturing, positively

contributed to the overall growth in manufacturing

activities. Further, manufacturing of coke and refined

petroleum products, chemical products and basic

pharmaceutical products, and manufacturing of

machinery and equipment also recorded a favourable

growth in 2019. Considering the manufacturing

related indicators, the Index of Industrial Production

(IIP) compiled by the DCS indicated an increase of

1.3 per cent in 2019 in comparison to the increase

of 0.8 per cent recorded in 2018. Meanwhile, the

Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing

activities, compiled by the CBSL, on a monthly basis,

also indicated an overall expansion in manufacturing

activities during the year. Noticeably, the

manufacturing PMI recorded the historically lowest

value in April 2019 reflecting the immediate impact of

Easter Sunday attacks and recovered afterwards in

May registering an expansion indicating a rebound in

manufacturing activities.

Index of Industrial Production

The manufacturing sector registered a

marginal expansion in 2019 with increased

production in major sub sectors. As per the Index

of Industrial Production (IIP), the manufacturing

sector, which accounts for around 60 per cent of the

total industry sector, witnessed a limited growth of

1.3 per cent in 2019 owing to numerous challenges

such as the Easter Sunday attacks, volatile oil prices

and unfavourable weather conditions. The main

drivers of growth in manufacturing industries were

the manufacturing of beverages, wearing apparel,

wood products except furniture, paper and paper

products, coke and refined petroleum products,

chemicals and chemical products, other non-

metallic mineral products and electrical equipment.

Other sub sectors, including the manufacturing of

food products, tobacco products, textiles, leather

and related products, printing and reproduction of

recorded media, basic pharmaceutical products,

rubber and plastic products, basic metals, fabricated

metal products, machinery and equipment as well

as furniture witnessed a contraction during the

reference period.

Partly affected by the Easter Sunday attacks,

the food products sub sector, the largest sub

sector in the IIP, slowed down in 2019 compared

to the expansion witnessed in the previous year.

The food products sub sector registered a marginal

contraction of 0.4 per cent in 2019 in comparison

to a growth of 1.0 per cent in 2018. The subdued

performance of the food products sub sector was

due to the weak performance in the manufacturing

of canned fish, milk powder, bread, chicken, biscuits

and salt. The deceleration in the food products sub

sector was mainly due to the decreased domestic

demand caused by the Easter Sunday attacks that

had a spillover impact on the food manufacturing

sector, high cost of production and relatively high

international food prices. In line with the increased

global milk powder prices, domestic prices of

imported milk powder products were increased

in September. However, reflecting the reduction

of the Value Added Tax and the Nation Building

Tax by the government, the prices of imported

milk powder products were reduced in December

2019. Nevertheless, in order to overcome the

challenges in the food industry and to enhance the

manufacture of food items, the food industry needs

to introduce value added products for all market

segments in line with consumer preferences and

changing lifestyles while strengthening distribution

networks, particularly in rural areas. Further, brand

building targeting foreign markets and timely

market information are also important to transform

the domestic food industry to be more competitive

in the global market.

The manufacture of wearing apparel

activities showed a subdued performance

amidst slower growth in major traditional

export markets while the manufacture of textile

activities recorded a marginal contraction.

The manufacture of the wearing apparel sub

sector, which accounts for around one fifth

of the IIP, registered a moderate growth of

1.9 per cent in 2019 in comparison to a growth

of 3.9 per cent in the previous year. Meanwhile,

the manufacturing of textile products, which

showed an expansion of 3.6 per cent in 2018,

reported a decline of 1.7 per cent in 2019. The

decreased production of finished fabric and coir

mattresses largely contributed to the contraction

in textiles production in 2019. Although the export

oriented garment and textile industry has made a

significant contribution to the Sri Lankan economy

in terms of generating employment and creating

opportunities for local entrepreneurs, escalating

labour costs and excessive dependence on GSP+

concessions have reduced the competitiveness

of the industry and increased vulnerability of the

sector to shocks in global markets. Therefore,

it is crucial to take necessary steps to make the

industry more competitive in the global market,

through the diversification of export markets and

increased value addition, while facilitating to

diversify beyond the apparel industry.

The manufacture of coke and refined

petroleum products witnessed an expansion

in 2019. Supported by the increased production

of petrol, auto diesel, furnace oil and bitumen,

the manufacture of coke and refined petroleum

products sub sector witnessed a growth of

9.6 per cent in 2019 compared to a growth of

3.4 per cent in the preceding year. The petroleum

refinery of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation

(CPC) was shut down for more than one and a

half months during the first quarter of 2018 for

maintenance purposes, but the refinery process

continued without any disruption in 2019.

Accordingly, the total refined petroleum products

generated by the CPC recorded an increase of

11.9 per cent to 1.8 million metric tons in 2019,

from 1.6 million metric tons in 2018. Depending

on crude oil and refined petroleum price levels in

the global market, it may be more economical to

refine crude oil domestically than importing refined

petroleum products in certain periods. Presently,

around 70 per cent of the refined requirement of

Sri Lanka is imported, and hence there is a timely

need to modernise the Sapugaskanda oil refinery

by upgrading the existing machinery. It is expected

that the new crude oil refinery projects proposed

to be established in the Port of Hambantota

would support increasing the petroleum refining

capacity of the country in the medium term while

curbing foreign exchange outflows on account of

petroleum imports to a certain extent.

The manufacture of the other non-metallic

mineral products sub sector showed signs

of recovery in 2019. This sub sector registered

a growth of 8.2 per cent in 2019 compared to

a contraction of 2.4 per cent recorded in the

previous year. The increased production of

cement, glass bottles, floor tiles and porcelain

tableware in response to the higher demand from

state infrastructure development projects and

the expansion in commercial construction largely

contributed to the favourable developments in

this sub sector. The domestic cement production,

which plays a major role in this sub sector,

witnessed an increase of 19.5 per cent while the

import of cement recorded a contraction of 7.6

per cent during 2019. The growth in the production

of cement was mainly supported by capacity

enhancements of cement manufacturers.

The manufacture of rubber and plastic

products and leather and related products,

which accounts for around 6 per cent of

the overall IIP, recorded a contraction in

2019. While reduced production of rubber tyres

contributed to the slowdown in the manufacture

of the rubber and plastic products sub sector,

the contraction in leather and related product

categories was mainly due to a decline in the

production of school shoes and shoes for men.

Currently, the USA and China are the major

markets for Sri Lanka’s rubber and leather product

exports. With subdued demand from China and

the USA due to the slowdown in their economies,

as well as the increased imported supply of such

products domestically, the demand for domestic

rubber and leather based products declined in

2019.

The manufacture of the chemicals and

chemical products sub sector exhibited a

favourable growth of 10.3 per cent in 2019 as

against a contraction of 4.1 per cent witnessed

in 2018. Fertiliser, ply bags, sanitary napkins and

boxes of matches are some of the major items that

drove the production growth in the chemicals and

chemical products sub sector in 2019.

The manufacture of beverages sub sector

showed a moderate expansion in 2019 supported

by the increased production of beer and non-

alcoholic beverage products such as soft drinks.

Accordingly, the beverages sub sector recorded

a growth of 3.6 per cent in 2019, in comparison

to a growth of 9.1 per cent recorded in 2018. The

increased production of beer was largely driven

by external demand, resulting in an export growth

of 57.2 per cent for beer in 2019. However, lower

domestic demand from local households and the

tourism sector owing to the Easter Sunday attacks

significantly affected domestic sales and the demand

for liquor in 2019. The excise tax applicable on locally

manufactured liquor as well as imported liquor based

on their alcohol content was increased in March and

December 2019, which partly resulted in a decline

in domestic demand, and thereby overall liquor

production, particularly in terms of distilling, rectifying

and blending of spirits. Meanwhile, demand for soft

drink items increased owing to drought and warm

weather conditions that prevailed in most parts of the

country during the period under review.

The manufacture of wood products except

furniture, electrical equipment, and paper and

paper products sub sectors witnessed an

expansion in 2019. Largely due to the increased

production of railway sleepers, the manufacture

of wood products except for furniture registered

a marginal expansion of 3.3 per cent in 2019

compared to an expansion of 5.3 per cent

recorded in 2018. Meanwhile, the increased

production of electric panel boards, aluminium

insulated wire, bare wire and washing machine

related components resulted in an expansion in

the manufacture of electrical equipment sub sector

(6.3 per cent). Supported by the increased

production of corrugated paper, paper bags, CR

books and exercise books, the manufacture of

paper and paper products recorded a growth of

11.4 per cent during the period under review

compared to a contraction of 19.9 per cent recorded

in the previous year.

The manufacture of tobacco products,

basic metals, fabricated metal products,

furniture and the manufacture of printing and

reproduction of recorded media sub sectors

reported contractions in 2019. In response to

lower demand for tobacco products caused by

price hikes, legal restrictions, increased taxes

on tobacco products as well as growing health

awareness among the public, the manufacture

of tobacco products contracted in 2019 for the

second consecutive year, reporting an annual

decline of 12.6 per cent. The decreased production

of cigarettes largely contributed to the slowdown

in the manufacturing of tobacco products sub

sector in 2019. In the meantime, the production

of basic metals registered a contraction of

3.2 per cent during the period under review, mainly

due to the decreased production of aluminium

bars. Further, the manufacture of furniture

sub sector recorded a marginal contraction of

0.4 per cent compared to a contraction of

13.9 per cent recorded in the previous year

owing to the lower level of production of wooden

furniture, plastic chairs, rubber mattresses and

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

80

coir mattresses. In addition, the manufacture

of fabricated metal products sub sector also

witnessed a contraction of 11.7 per cent in 2019

compared to an expansion of 8.3 per cent in 2018,

due to lower production of steel, oil water and cement

bowsers, fuel storage tanks, steel furniture, lead

oxide and aluminium products. In the meantime,

the manufacture of printing and reproduction of

recorded media reported a contraction of 3.4

per cent in 2019 following the marginal contraction

of 0.4 per cent in 2018. The reduced production

of newspapers, school stationery, printing books,

and cartons largely contributed to the slowdown in

printing and reproduction of recorded media.

Industrial Policies and Institutional Support

The government took several policy

measures to promote innovation and thereby

improve the country’s competitive advantage

in an increasingly challenging market

environment. With the participation of the line

ministries, state organisations, universities, tri-

forces, police, private sector and other relevant

stakeholders, two Shilpasena Expositions were

conducted in 2019. The Shilpasena Exposition,

which was designed to add science and technology

to the Sri Lankan mindset, provided opportunities

for inventors to showcase and market their

inventions and innovations. The government

also initiated programmes to popularise Science,

Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics

(STEM) education and modern technologies

among various segments of the society while

creating a linkage for research commercialisation.

Further, the government continued its efforts to

formulate a national mineral policy that would

create a favourable environment for mineral based

industries while providing value addition to mineral

resources. Meanwhile, the National Science and

Technology Commission (NASTEC) was in the

process of updating the existing national science

and technology policy while incorporating aspects

of innovation and commercialisation. In 2019, the

Sri Lanka Institute of Nanotechnology (SLINTEC)

evaluated over 100 research projects and continued

to implement several revenue generating projects.

The Technology Transfer (Vidatha) Programme

that seeks to transfer scientific knowledge and

research innovations of scientists to the Micro,

Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) at the

grassroot level through an islandwide network

of Vidatha Resource Centres continued in 2019

as well. During the year under review, 3,028

Vidatha programmes were conducted, from

which approximately 118,400 MSMEs benefitted.

Meanwhile, the Vidatha Haritha Kada Mandiya

programme that provides opportunities to the

Vidatha entrepreneurs to improve their product

quality also continued in 2019. The government

facilitated the Vidatha entrepreneurs by conducting

several exhibitions in Batticaloa, Ampara,

Mullaitivu, Moneragala, Gampaha and Jaffna

districts in parallel to the Shilpasena Exposition

as a marketplace to promote the products of small

entrepreneurs. In 2019, with a view to expanding

technology applications in the country, 35 science

and technology special projects covering rural

communities in 15 districts were conducted. In the

meantime, the National Institute of Fundamental

Studies (NIFS) continued to develop microbial bio-

fertiliser to reduce the use of imported chemical

fertiliser. In cooperation with the Department

of Agriculture, the NIFS applied bio-fertiliser

to 15,000 acres of rice cultivation in 2019 and

expect to expand the bio-fertiliser applications to

50,000 acres in 2020. Meanwhile, the Cabinet of

Ministers approved the provision of long term loan

facilities for companies that will start mechatronics

based product development and designing and

certifying of mechatronics products under the

2

NATIONAL OUTPUT, EXPENDITURE AND INCOME

81

‘Enterprise Sri Lanka’ loan scheme. The

government, together with the Coordinating

Secretariat for Science, Technology and

Innovation (COSTI) and the National Engineering

and Research and Development Centre (NERDC),

was in the process of implementing a project on

Mechatronics enabled Economic Development

Initiative aiming to grow the domestic economy

with high-tech exports while reducing imports by

designing smart machines for local and global

manufacturers.

Several line ministries continued to

implement numerous initiatives to support

the domestic manufacturing sector while

assisting the formulation of relevant policies.

The government is in the process of establishing

business service centres catering to MSMEs at the

district level. Such business service centres will

facilitate technology transfer, skills development,

quality and productivity improvement and research

and development activities. An Inter-Ministerial

Task Force has been established for industrial

and entrepreneur development with the objective

of minimising delays and problems in the decision

making process in relation to the manufacturing

industry. In 2019, the approval of the Cabinet of

Ministers was granted to initiate the formulation of

a National Industrial Policy (NIP). The NIP will be

prepared in line with the objectives outlined in the

National Policy Framework of Sri Lanka for 2020-

2025: Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour as well

as the Sustainable Development Goals. The NIP

is expected to create a conducive environment

for the industrial sector while facilitating industries

operating at higher tiers to graduate to the Industry

4.0 level, the trend towards manufacturing

automation and information exchange throughout

the manufacturing process, by moving beyond

computer automation to cyber-physical machines.

Various public institutions and industry

chambers continued to implement numerous

initiatives to promote the domestic industrial

sector. In 2019, the National Chamber of

Commerce of Sri Lanka (NCCSL) continued its

endeavours to educate and uplift the Small and

Medium Enterprises (SMEs) sector by conducting

several training programmes in various parts of

the country with a view to assist SMEs to develop

their business skills and knowledge. The NCCSL,

with the assistance of the government, conducted

an International Healthcare Exhibition in July 2019

with the aim of providing opportunities to promote

indigenous and western medicinal products and

services. The Sri Lanka Chamber of Small and

Medium Industries (SLCSMI) prepared a strategic

plan to address the concerns of SMEs and

conducted several workshops under the Enterprise

Sri Lanka programme to create awareness among

SME entrepreneurs. The SLCSMI took part in

various trade fairs, exhibitions, international trade

delegation meetings while creating networks

with prospective buyers and sellers in a common

platform. Meanwhile, the Ceylon Chamber of

Commerce (CCC) continued to facilitate numerous

trade delegations, training programmes and trade

forums to promote trade and investment. The

Industrial Technology Institute (ITI), among other

initiatives, offered services in food technology

areas, especially on the preparation of food to

retain high nutritional value with low added sucrose,

to upgrade selected MSMEs mainly in the Jaffna,

Killinochchi and Vavuniya districts in 2019. In the

meantime, the Industrial Development Board (IDB)

continued its activities to modernise and upgrade

infrastructure facilities in eleven industrial estates

during the period under review. During the year,

554 new firms were established under the IDB,

of which, more than 40 per cent of firms were in

the category of food, beverages and tobacco

products. Further, seventeen new enterprises

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

82

were established with a total investment of Rs. 448

million in eight industrial estates, creating 336 new

direct employment opportunities. With the evolving

employment opportunities in the field of gem

cutting, jewellery designing and manufacturing,

the National Gem and Jewellery Authority (NGJA)

conducted several special industrial training

programmes for stakeholders while addressing

the labour shortage in the industry. It is expected

that the removal of Nation Building Tax (NBT)

imposed on imports of gemstones by a person

registered with the NGJA for the purpose of re-

exporting after cutting and polishing such gems,

would encourage the value addition in the gem

and jewellery industry. Formulation and consistent

implementation of a national policy for the industrial

sector development, in coordination with various

government institutions and trade chambers, are

vital to boost growth in the industry sector.

The Board of Investment (BOI) and the

Export Development Board (EDB) took

several measures to attract investment from

both domestic and foreign sources while

actively promoting export oriented domestic

manufacturing industries. Several initiatives

were taken to improve service delivery in the IT

industry by addressing regulatory deficiencies and

inter-agency coordination issues while minimising

the lead time that increases transaction costs to

the investors. As at end 2019, thirteen Memoranda

of Understanding (MoUs) were signed between

the BOI and respective line agencies to provide a

framework for granting approvals within a stipulated

time period and fast track the approval processes.

The BOI continued to take various measures

to encourage local market oriented projects to

increase their export quantities. In this regard, the

BOI took steps to encourage companies that were

previously focusing on the domestic market to

enter the export market by granting customs duty

exemptions. There are around 5,000 employment

vacancies available in projects operating within BOI

zones, but the companies find it difficult to fill these

vacancies due to the lack of suitable applicants.

Therefore, the BOI, in collaboration with line

ministries, conducted several job fairs and career

fair programmes countrywide to create awareness

on employment opportunities available in BOI

projects. In order to encourage the investment

required for the domestic information technology

industry, a zero Corporate Income Tax (CIT) rate

was granted with effect from 1 January 2020 for gains

and profits earned by any company that provides

information technology and enabling services. It is

expected that the reduction in the CIT rate would

encourage reputed global IT companies to invest

in Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, the BOI signed several

agreements with a number of private companies to

set up factories in Sri Lanka to manufacture various

industrial products, including tyres and aluminium

food containers, while providing a range of services

to meet the increasing demand emerging from

international markets. The EDB conducted several

programmes to identify and encourage new export

oriented SMEs by providing trade facilities and

conducting a number of education programmes

on packaging, labelling, export pricing and costing

at regional levels. In order to attract multinational

companies on electronics and electrical equipment

to Sri Lanka with the aim of linking the domestic

electrical and electronics manufacturing industry

with global supply chains, the Cabinet of Ministers,

in 2019, granted approval to implement the

Multinational Corporation Outreach programme

by the EDB and BOI. The programme envisages

establishing 3 to 5 multinational electronics and

electrical manufacturing companies in Sri Lanka

by 2022. The programme expects to attract FDIs

to the domestic electrical equipment industry while

creating employment opportunities.

Several loan schemes were introduced with

the aim to support SMEs in the industry sector

in 2019. High interest rates and a lack of collateral

are major issues that hinder the growth of SMEs

in the country. In order to overcome these issues,

the government introduced a loan scheme with

concessionary interest rates for SMEs and provided

credit guarantees to mitigate the collateral issue.

Under the loan scheme of Jaya Isuru and Small

and Medium Enterprise Line of Credit programme

(SMELoC), Rs. 26.5 billion was granted to SMEs.

Accordingly, 964 loans were granted under the

SMELoC in 2019 by disbursing Rs. 7.4 billion.

As industrial activities were severely affected by

the Easter Sunday attacks, the Ministry of Finance,

Economic and Policy Development introduced

two loan schemes, namely the Working Capital

Loan and Sancharaka Poddo, to support SMEs in

the industry sector. Further, under the Enterprise

Sri Lanka programme, 44,841 loans were granted,

disbursing Rs. 84.9 billion by the end 2019.

Electricity, Water and Waste Treatment

Electricity, water and waste treatment

activities grew by 4.9 per cent in 2019

compared to its growth of 6.0 per cent in 2018,

in value added terms, largely supported by

the performance in the electricity category.

Accordingly, electricity, gas, steam and air

conditioning supply activities expanded by 4.0

per cent in 2019, which grew by 5.9 per cent in

2018. Considering the electricity generation data,

the total electricity generation recorded a growth of

3.3 per cent in 2019 compared to its growth of 4.8

per cent in 2018. Considering the total generation

mix during the year, hydropower generation

declined by 24.9 per cent in 2019, largely due to

low rainfall in the catchment areas, particularly

during the first half of the year, in comparison to

the substantial growth of 59.4 per cent recorded in

2018. Accordingly, fuel oil and coal based power

generation increased during the year by 38.2

per cent and 12.5 per cent, respectively, which

contracted by 28.1 per cent and 6.7 per cent,

respectively, in 2018. Considering the other sub

economic activities within the category, the value

added of water collection, treatment and supply

activities grew by 5.5 per cent in 2019, compared

to its growth of 5.8 per cent in 2018. In this regard,

the units of water distributed by the National Water

Supply and Drainage Board (NWS&DB) increased

by 5.0 per cent in 2019 reflecting the expansion

in water supply activities, compared to 4.8 per

cent growth recorded in 2018. Further, the total

number of consumer accounts of NWS&DB also

increased by 4.7 per cent in 2019 in comparison to

its growth of 4.9 per cent recorded in the previous

year. Meanwhile, the value added of sewerage,

waste treatment and disposal activities grew by 7.3

per cent in 2019 compared to the growth of 6.7 per

cent recorded in 2018.

Construction

Construction activities rebounded during

the year, growing by 4.0 per cent in value added

terms, against the contraction of 2.5 per cent,

in 2018 with the accelerated completion of

large scale construction projects. Extension of

the Southern Expressway and the Outer Circular

Highway, and the rapid progress of the Central

Expressway project ahead of the presidential

election, as well as the construction work related

to condominium development projects largely

contributed to the expansion in construction

activities during the year. The rebound in

construction activities was reflected by the increase

in total cement availability of the country by 2.1

per cent in 2019, recovering from its contraction of

6.3 per cent in 2018. Accordingly, local production

of cement grew at a higher rate of 19.5 per cent

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

84

in 2019 compared to a marginal growth of 0.8

per cent recorded in 2018, while cement imports

continued to contract by 7.6 per cent in 2019 over

the contraction of 9.9 per cent recorded in 2018.

Further, the building material imports volume index

increased by 1.5 per cent during the year against

the decline of 3.7 per cent witnessed in 2018,

indicating the positive developments taken place in

construction activities during the year. Meanwhile,

credit to the private sector granted by Licensed

Commercial Banks (LCBs) for construction

activities grew by 5.6 per cent as at end December

2019 compared to the growth of 14.1 per cent

recorded as at end December 2018. Moreover,

credit granted for personal housing construction

activities by LCBs grew by 5.4 per cent as at end

December 2019 compared to the growth of 13.1

per cent recorded as at end December 2018.

However, as per the economic insights unveiled

by the business surveys conducted by CBSL,

the long delay in payments for the government

related projects which created severe financial

constraints for construction firms was highlighted

as a barrier for sustaining the growth momentum

in the construction industry. The respondents

mentioned that the majority of the firms struggled

to survive throughout the year due to the financial

constraints.

Services

Reflecting the adverse impact from the

Easter Sunday attacks, Services activities

slowed down to 2.3 per cent in value added

terms in 2019, recording the lowest growth

in nearly five years, down from 4.6 per cent

in 2018. The impact of the attacks mainly

extended to tourism related services including

accommodation, transportation, wholesale and

retail trade activities, and other personal services.

Accordingly, accommodation, food and beverage

service activities contracted during the year

dampening the overall growth of services, while

wholesale and retail trade activities, other personal

services and transportation activities which were

the major contributors to the overall growth of the

services, grew at a slower pace compared to the

previous year. Meanwhile, financial services, real

estate, public administration, telecommunication,

insurance, education, professional services, human

health and IT programming consultancy and related

services expanded during the year. The PMI for

Services activities, compiled by the CBSL on a

monthly basis, indicated the lowest index value in

May 2019 since the beginning of survey reflecting

the adverse impact stemmed from the Easter

Sunday attacks on Services activities. However,

The gig economy1 broadly refers to an economy where freelancers or independent contractors (“gig workers”) widely exist in the labour market as opposed to traditional work arrangements between the employer and employee (Figure B 5.1). The most common examples of gig activities include ride-sharing2 and peer-to-peer (P2P) accommodation3, which can be virtually extended to any service offering P2P and global online freelancing platforms. However, the gig economy not only influences economic growth worldwide by opening new avenues for workers, but also poses challenges in terms of regulatory environment and gauging data of macroeconomic scale such as growth and employment.

The gig economy has resulted in a reshaping of the existing services delivery channels through the adoption of digital technology by providing flexibility and minimising information asymmetry between clients and workers. Clients make their payroll flexible by hiring gig workers wherever necessary instead of maintaining their own staff. Workers also prefer gig contracts due to the flexibility it provides in terms of working hours with no limitations on

BOX 5The Emergence of the Gig Economy and Its Challenges

earnings while also providing a better work-life balance (Figure B 5.2). Further, digital platforms, particularly, mobile apps that effectively match workers and clients almost instantly, allow workers to undertake an optimal number of tasks and offer services at most competitive rates. Moreover, digital platforms facilitate workers who are currently employed in regular jobs to seek for an additional stream of income on a part-time basis.

Despite its increasing popularity, the gig economy does not only provide opportunities but also poses challenges with regard to regulatory environment, collection of government revenue and particularly compiling official statistics.

The existing regulations that aim to protect worker rights and welfare, which mainly target persons employed at an organisational set-up, are under criticism and require to be revisited in light of the gig economy, as gig workers may not be sufficiently covered through such arrangements. Similarly, gig platforms, which are operating worldwide despite being based in a particular country, are difficult to be controlled by the host country’s regulatory environment and taxation system in the absence of local business registration. In contrast, local platforms are under regulatory scrutiny and are liable for local taxes. Such differences in the applicability of regulation will not ensure a level playing field for local operators.

The emergence of the gig economy has created many challenges on the conventional way of measuring economic activities and estimating labour force statistics. Gig workers are not properly accounted for in the labour market statistics as the surveys provide only limited information on the additional engagements in jobs in gig nature (Bean, 2016). Even if such data are collected through surveys, work arrangements of a gig nature could create duplication (or multiplication) errors when the engagements in gig work are in addition to the primary employment4.

The compilers of National Accounts are also under severe criticism on the grounds that economic activities might be underestimated due to inadequate coverage of the gig economy. From the production side, underestimation of national accounts could occur due to the lack of data on the magnitude of gig economic activities. The extra income generated by improved utilisation of resources under the gig economy might not be fully accounted for in the official estimates. For example, renting a room of a house for a tourist or hiring a vehicle through digital platforms adds value to the economy, yet there is no proper source to quantify the value added from such activities. Further, using deflators in determining the real value added is a common practice in national income accounting. Statisticians use price indices as deflators to derive real values from nominal values. However,

4 As cited by Zainudeen (2019), Katz and Krueger (2019) have estimated in 2015 that the growth of U.S. gig employment between 2005-2015 was 5%, which was later revised to 1-2%. One of the reasons for overestimation earlier was the lack of recognition of multiple employment in surveys.

prices offered at gig economy platforms are significantly lower than the prices elsewhere and might not be properly reflected in official price indices (Bean, 2016). This will lead to an overestimation of price indices. In such instances, the value added to economic activity, estimated in real terms using such price deflators, would be underestimated. Moreover, sharing services in a gig economy pose challenges for the expenditure classification of national accounts, as well. For example, purchasing a car for personal use is considered as a household consumption expenditure, whereas a car purchased for renting purposes is considered as an investment. However, when a car is purchased for personal use but is utilised for an income-generating activity such as ride-sharing, it is difficult to estimate in practice the respective proportions related to investment and consumption. This leads to an underestimation of investment expenditure (Bean, 2016).

Statisticians and policymakers should continuously experiment for better sources of data and indicators that capture the impact and contribution of the gig economy since traditional sources and methods in use are ill-equipped to accurately estimate economic activities within the gig economy. In addressing this issue, advanced countries like Canada have succeeded in capturing gig income data to a certain extent using ‘self-employees’ tax returns’ (Jeon et al., 2019). Further, a well-structured household survey that covers multiple employment income might also be able to capture income earned through gig work to a greater extent. Moreover, digital platforms that facilitate gig workers could be a vital source of data, particularly when a few platforms dominate the market.

In Sri Lanka, some of the gig economy activities, such as platform-based ride-sharing services and accommodation services have emerged in recent years. A significant number of persons living in the Western province and other urban and semi-urban areas already use mobile apps to hire a taxi or a truck instead of waiting by the roadside. Further, the gig economy would gradually reach the rural community as well, where there could be a significant potential to use gig activity in areas such as farm machinery sharing. Considering the importance of capturing gig activities in official statistics, authorities dealing with official statistics in Sri Lanka are currently working on alternative methods to estimate the gig economy. However, the unavailability of reliable data remains a major obstacle in understanding the significance of the gig economy and its impact on the Sri Lankan economy. Although gig economic activity of developing countries like Sri Lanka would be significantly lower than that of developed countries, it is certainly worth monitoring the gig economy as it is one of the fastest-growing areas in this digitalised world.

the Services PMI indicated an expansion from June

onwards after the historical setback, indicating

the gradual revival of Services activities. Yet, the

Demand sub index of BOS related to the Services

segment, remained in the negative territory during

the last three quarters of the year, demonstrating

the sluggish performance in Services activities

following the Easter Sunday attacks.

Wholesale and Retail Trade

The value added of wholesale and retail

trade activities expanded by 3.0 per cent

in 2019, yet at a slower pace, compared to

the growth of 4.7 per cent in 2018 with the

slowdown in overall demand of the economy

and import trade activities, as well as the

sluggish growth in domestic agriculture

activities linked to trade activities. The Easter

Sunday attacks adversely affected the overall

demand of the economy, particularly during the

second quarter of the year. Further, policies

introduced to curtail imports affected import trade

activities. Considering the movement of trade

indices, the total imports volume index declined by

5.8 per cent in 2019, from the increase of 1.8 per

cent in 2018. Within the imports volume index, the

consumer and intermediate goods imports volume

declined during the year while investment goods

imports volume registered a recovery. Accordingly,

the consumer goods imports volume index, which

increased by 9.6 per cent in 2018, decreased by

20.7 per cent in 2019 mainly due to the significant

decline in vehicle imports and the setback in food

and drinks imports. Further, the intermediate goods

import volume index decreased by 3.8 per cent in

2019 as opposed to the increase of 2.3 per cent

in 2018. However, the investment goods import

volume index recorded an increase of 1.6 per cent

in 2019 recovering from the decline of 0.3 per

cent in 2018. Meanwhile, the total exports volume

index increased by 7.1 per cent in 2019, compared

to the marginal increase of 0.5 per cent in 2018,

largely supported by the surge in industrial exports

coupled with the recovery in agricultural exports.

Transportation and Storage

Transportation of goods and passengers,

including warehousing activities grew at a

slower rate of 1.4 per cent in 2019 compared

to the growth of 2.1 per cent in 2018, in value

added terms, due to the decline in the mobility

of local community with certain security

measures taken aftermath of the Easter

Sunday attacks, as well as the spill-over

effects of the setback in the tourism related

activities. Most of the transportation related

indicators witnessed a subdued performance

throughout the year, reflecting the moderation

in transportation services. Accordingly,

passenger kilometres operated by transportation

service providers recorded a decline in 2019

in comparison to the growth recorded in 2018.

Considering land transportation, the total

passenger kilometres operated by the Sri Lanka

Transport Board and the private sector bus

operators declined by 3.4 per cent in 2019, from

the growth of 6.7 per cent in 2018. Further, the

passenger kilometres operated by the Sri Lanka

Railways also recorded a decline of 5.2 per

cent in 2019 as opposed to the growth of 2.9

per cent in 2018. In terms of air transportation

activities, the total passenger kilometres flown

by SriLankan Airlines contracted by 4.1 per cent

in 2019 mainly affected by the setback in tourist

arrivals, in contrast to its growth of 14.2 per cent

in 2018. Further, the freight ton kilometres flown

by SriLankan Airlines also contracted by 6.7 per

cent in 2019, which grew by 7.1 per cent in 2018.

In the meantime, water transportation related

activities also indicated a slowdown during the

2

year. Accordingly, container traffic (Twenty Foot

Equivalent Units - TEUs) and cargo handled by

Sri Lankan ports grew only at slower rates of 2.6

per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively, in 2019,

compared to the respective high growth rates of

13.5 per cent and 11.8 per cent recorded in 2018.

Meanwhile, the value added of postal and courier

activities grew by 5.9 per cent in 2019, compared

to the growth of 1.4 per cent recorded in 2018.

Accommodation and Food Service Activities

The value added of accommodation and

food service activities recorded a contraction

of 4.6 per cent in 2019, as opposed to its growth

of 5.7 per cent recorded in 2018, with the

significant drop in tourist arrivals aftermath of

the Easter Sunday attacks. The number of tourist

arrivals in 2019 declined by 18.0 per cent against

the growth of 10.3 per cent in 2018. Following a

similar trend, the earnings from tourism also fell

by 17.7 per cent in 2019 from the growth of 11.6

per cent in 2018, reflecting the setback in the

tourism industry. However, benefitting from the

tourism promotion campaigns and other effective

measures taken after the Easter Sunday attacks,

tourist arrivals gradually recovered since June

2019 on a month on month basis. Further, private

consumption expenditure on restaurants and

hotels, as shown in Gross Domestic Expenditure

slowed down in 2019, indicating the sluggish

demand for accommodation and restaurant

facilities. Meanwhile, the room occupancy rate in

graded hotel establishments approved by the Sri

Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA)

decreased substantially to 57.1 per cent in 2019

compared to 72.8 per cent recorded in 2018.

Information and Communication

Expansion in telecommunication services,

as well as IT programming consultancy and

related activities, spurred the growth in

information and communication activities, in

value added terms, at a rate of 15.7 per cent

in 2019 compared to the growth of 9.6 per

cent in 2018. Accordingly, telecommunication

services grew at a higher rate of 17.2 per cent in

2019 compared to the growth of 10.4 per cent in

2018. The indicators related to telecommunication

services denoted a wide expansion during the

year, reflecting the rising demand for these

services in the economy. Accordingly, both

cellular subscribers, as well as fixed access wire

line connections increased while fixed access

wireless connections witnessed a decline during

the year. Further, the growing demand for internet

connectivity was also headed to a substantial

increase in internet services of the country during

the year. Meanwhile, IT programming consultancy

and related activities grew at a higher rate of 13.1

per cent in 2019, signalling the growing demand

for IT based services in the economy, further

increasing from the growth of 11.1 per cent in 2018.

In the meantime, programming and broadcasting

activities, and audio video productions activities

grew by 4.8 per cent in 2019 recovering from the

contraction of 10.2 per cent recorded in 2018.

Financial, Insurance and Real Estate Activities including Ownership of Dwellings

The value added of financial, insurance and

real estate activities including ownership of

dwellings activities expanded at a slower pace

of 2.5 per cent in 2019 compared to the growth

of 9.6 per cent in 2018, largely driven by the

considerably slower growth in financial service

activities. Accordingly, financial service activities

and auxiliary financial services grew only by 2.0

per cent in 2019 compared to the higher growth of

13.4 per cent recorded in 2018. The financial services

related indicators also denoted a gradual slowdown

throughout the year. Accordingly, the gross loans and

advances in the banking sector grew at a relatively

slower pace of 5.6 per cent in 2019 compared to the

significant growth of 19.6 per cent recorded in 2018.

Meanwhile, the gross loans and advances in non-

bank financial institutions recorded a decline of 0.9

per cent during the year from its growth of 8.7 per

cent recorded in 2018. This slower expansion of loans

and advances was also reflected by the demand for

bank credit sub index of BOS conducted by CBSL,

which on average indicated a slower increase in 2019

compared to 2018. Further, the deposit base of banks

and non-bank financial institutions grew by 7.9 per

cent and 5.6 per cent respectively, in 2019, compared

to respective growth rates of 14.8 per cent and 4.4

per cent recorded in 2018. Meanwhile, the value

added of real estate activities, including ownership of

dwellings, grew by 2.4 per cent in 2019 in comparison

to the growth of 3.9 per cent in 2018. In the meantime,

value added of insurance, reinsurance and pension

funds related activities grew by a slower pace of

5.8 per cent in 2019 compared to the growth of 17.3

per cent in 2018. Considering the insurance industry

related indicators, both the premiums earned and the

claims incurred by the insurance industry recorded a

growth in 2019.

Professional Services and Other Personal Service Activities

Professional services and other personal

service activities grew by 2.2 per cent in

2019, in value added terms, with the relatively

slower growth in other personal services as

well as the professional services compared to

the previous year. Accordingly, other personal

services grew by 2.1 per cent in 2019 compared

to the growth of 2.7 per cent recorded in 2018.

The overall slowdown in the economy might have

affected the demand for such personal services. In

the meantime, professional, scientific, technical,

administration and support service activities

grew at a slower pace of 2.4 per cent in 2019 in

comparison to the 4.3 per cent growth recorded

in 2018.

Public Administration, Defence, Education, Human Health and Social Work Activities

With the recovery of public administration

and defence services, the value added of public

administration, defence, education, human

health and social work activities expanded by

2.3 per cent in 2019 from 1.2 per cent in 2018.

Accordingly, public administration, defence and

compulsory social security activities grew by 2.1 per

cent in 2019 against the contraction of 0.6 per cent

recorded in 2018. Further, human health activities,

residential care and social work activities grew by

1.9 per cent in 2019 in comparison to the growth

of 3.0 per cent recorded in 2018. In the meantime,

education services recorded a growth of 3.1 per

cent in 2019, contributing positively to the overall

growth of the segment, though at a slower rate,

compared to the growth of 4.0 per cent recorded

in 2018.

2.5 Expenditure

Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE) which

consists of consumption and investment

expenditure of the economy, at current

prices, grew at a moderate pace of 3.3 per

cent amounting to Rs. 15,935.6 billion in

2019, compared to its growth of 8.0 per cent

in 2018. This slowdown was mainly attributable

to the considerable decline of 5.9 per cent

recorded in the investment expenditure during the

year against the growth of 3.8 per cent in 2018.

However, consumption expenditure at current

prices grew by 6.9 per cent in 2019 compared to

that of 9.7 per cent in 2018, contributing positively

to the growth in GDE. With regard to the external

demand at current prices, the export of goods

and services recorded a growth of 5.5 per cent

in 2019, in comparison to the growth of 13.2 per

cent recorded in 2018, while import of goods and

services recorded only a marginal growth of 0.9 per

cent in 2019, compared to the growth of 12.4 per

cent in 2018. The substantial slowdown in import

of goods and services in comparison to the growth

in export of goods and services led the net external

demand to record an improvement of 13.4 per cent

at current prices in 2019, compared to the decline

of 10.3 per cent recorded in 2018. Reflecting

the above developments, GDP at current prices,

which is the aggregate of GDE and net external

demand, amounted to Rs. 15,016.1 billion in 2019,

recording a growth of 4.5 per cent, compared to

the growth of 7.8 per cent in 2018. Considering the

developments in expenditure in constant prices,

consumption expenditure recorded a growth of

3.5 per cent in 2019, compared to the growth

of 2.9 per cent recorded in 2018. Nevertheless,

investment expenditure at constant prices, which

grew by 4.3 per cent in 2018, contracted by

9.5 per cent in 2019, leading to a decline in GDE

by 0.7 per cent against the growth of 3.3 per cent

in 2018. At constant prices, export of goods and

services grew by 7.1 per cent in 2019, compared

to the marginal growth of 0.5 per cent recorded in

2018, while import of goods and services recorded

a contraction of 5.8 per cent in 2019, against its

growth of 1.8 per cent in 2018. Accordingly, net

external demand at constant prices also improved

significantly by 23.2 per cent in 2019, compared to

the deterioration of 3.5 per cent recorded in 2018.

Consequently, GDP at constant prices grew by

2.3 per cent in 2019 in comparison to the growth

of 3.3 per cent in 2018.

Consumption

Benefiting from the upsurge in private

and government expenditure, consumption

expenditure, which is the largest expenditure

component of GDP expanded by 6.9 per cent

at current prices, in 2019 accounting for 78.7

per cent of GDP. However, private consumption,

especially related to transportation, clothing and,

restaurants and hotels was affected by the Easter

Sunday attacks due to declined mobility and low

tourist arrivals. Accordingly, private consumption

expenditure (PCE) recorded a growth of 6.8 per

cent, accounting for 88.0 per cent of the total

consumption expenditure in 2019, compared to

its growth of 9.0 per cent in 2018. Meanwhile,

government consumption expenditure at current

prices grew by 8.1 per cent in 2019 compared

to the growth of 15.2 per cent recorded in 2018.

This growth was largely driven by the expansion

in individual consumption expenditure of the

government which grew by 28.0 per cent while

the collective consumption expenditure of the

government recorded only a marginal growth of 0.2

per cent in 2019.

Private Consumption Expenditure (PCE)

PCE on foods and non-alcoholic beverages

at current prices, grew at a slower rate of

2.3 per cent in 2019, compared to the growth

of 8.5 per cent in 2018. Indicating this slowdown,

the import of food and beverages declined further

in 2019 compared to the previous year, both in

value and volume terms. Accordingly, the import

rupee value index and the volume index for food

and beverages declined by 1.7 per cent and 7.0

per cent, respectively, in 2019, which declined by

7.5 per cent and 11.8 per cent, respectively, in the

previous year. Further, the domestic agriculture

production recorded a slowdown causing a

moderation in food related manufacturing activities,

which might have partially contributed to the slight

increase in annual average food inflation by

0.7 per cent in 2019 compared to its decline of

0.2 per cent in 2018, as reflected by the National

Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013 = 100). The

combined outcome of these developments has

resulted the slower growth in PCE on food and

non-alcoholic beverages at current prices in 2019

compared to the previous year.

The clothing and footwear related PCE at

current prices grew by 4.5 per cent in 2019,

compared to the growth of 9.0 per cent in 2018.

Considering the import indices related to this

category, the import of clothing and accessories

in both rupee value and volume terms decreased

by 2.0 per cent and 16.9 per cent, respectively

in 2019, which declined respectively by 10.6 per

cent and 21.3 per cent in 2018. The manufacturing

of textiles, wearing apparel and leather related

products grew at a higher rate in 2019, compared

to the previous year indicating the expansion in

domestic supply. However, the annual average

prices of clothing and footwear category of NCPI

increased by 4.7 per cent in 2019 compared to 4.0

per cent increase in 2018.

PCE on housing, water, electricity, gas

and other fuels, at current prices, grew at a

higher rate of 7.9 per cent in 2019, compared

to the growth of 7.5 per cent recorded in

2018. Although there were no tariff revisions for

water and electricity during 2019, the significant

increase in housing rent and fuel prices, both

diesel and petrol prices, during the year compared

to 2018, mainly contributed to the increase in

2

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

92

household expenditure of this category. Further,

the electricity sales to the domestic sector

increased by 4.8 per cent in 2019, reflecting the

increase in electricity consumption, compared to

the growth of 3.9 per cent recorded in 2018. At

the same time, the distribution of water units to

the domestic sector grew by 5.6 per cent in 2019

compared to the growth of 4.6 per cent recorded in

the previous year. However, the price of domestic

liquid petroleum gas reduced during the year.

Meanwhile, the annual average prices of housing,

water, electricity, gas and other fuels category of

NCPI went up by 8.0 per cent in 2019, compared to

1.3 per cent increase in 2018, largely due to the

significant increase in housing rent, reflecting

increased price pressure in this category.

Transport activities related PCE at current

prices grew at a relatively slower pace of 8.0

per cent in 2019, compared to the growth of

12.5 per cent recorded in 2018. This edging

down of PCE on transport activities could be

partly attributable to the unchanged passenger

transport fares on bus services and railway

service during the year. Further, the import of

vehicles declined in both rupee value and volume

terms in 2019 compared to the substantial growth

recorded in 2018, reflecting the slowdown in PCE

on transport activities during the year. Meanwhile,

the annual average prices related to transport

category in NCPI increased by 4.0 per cent in

2019, compared to 8.4 per cent increase in 2018,

reflecting the relative slowdown in price pressure

in transportation related expenditure.

PCE on health activities at current prices

grew by 12.1 per cent in 2019, compared to

the growth of 10.9 per cent recorded in 2018,

while PCE on education activities increased

by 9.8 per cent in 2019, at the same rate as in

2018. Considering the price pressure, the health

category related annual average prices of NCPI

increased by 7.3 per cent in 2019, compared to

the 7.6 per cent increase in 2018. In the meantime,

Investment

Despite a favourable growth in gross fixed

capital formation, the investment expenditure

at current prices contracted by 5.9 per cent in

2019, compared to the growth of 3.8 per cent

recorded in 2018. The contraction in investment

expenditure was mainly driven by the significant

decline in changes in inventories and acquisition

less disposals of valuables. Considering the

growth in gross fixed capital formation, investment

on construction activities, which is the largest

category of the investment expenditure, recorded

a substantial growth in 2019 compared to the

previous year. This expansion was also observed

in the movements of trade indices which denoted

a recovery in the importation of investment goods,

including building materials. Further, a continuous

growth can be observed in credit granted by

LCBs to the private sector for construction

activities. Meanwhile, investment on machinery

and equipment and weapon systems, transport

equipment, information and communication

technology (ICT) equipment, and intellectual

property products also recorded a growth during

the year. However, investments on cultivated

biological resources recorded a decline in 2019

compared to the previous year. As reflected by

the business surveys conducted by the CBSL, the

decline in investment expenditure could be partly

attributable to the political and policy uncertainty

that prevailed in the country which delayed

investment decisions. Further, the investment

index of BOS, on average, edged down in 2019

compared to 2018 indicating the slowdown in

private investment activities. Considering the

government financial statistics, public investment

expenditure recorded a marginal growth in 2019

against the contraction recorded in 2018.

education category increased by 8.0 per cent in

2019 in comparison to 6.0 per cent increase in

2018. However, the share of health and education

related expenditure in overall PCE still remains

low due to the dominance of the public sector

in providing health and education services for

free of charge. This dominance was reflected

by the higher contribution to the value added of

health and education services from the General

Government sector under the institutional sector

classification.

Government Consumption Expenditure (GCE)

GCE at current prices, which comprises

of collective final consumption expenditure

(66.4 per cent of GCE) and individual final

consumption expenditure (33.6 per cent of

GCE) of the government, expanded by 8.1 per

cent in 2019 compared to the growth of 15.2 per

cent recorded in 2018, amidst the continuation

of fiscal consolidation measures. The collective

final consumption expenditure, which consists

of government expenditure on services such

as defence, social protection, general public

services, economic affairs and public order and

safety, expanded marginally by 0.2 per cent in

2019 compared to the higher growth of 20.1 per

cent in 2018. This was mainly attributable to the

decrease in government expenditure on general

public services, which recorded a contraction of

27.4 per cent in 2019 compared to a higher growth

of 112.3 per cent recorded in 2018. Meanwhile,

the individual final consumption expenditure of the

government, which mainly consists of government

expenditure on health and education services,

recorded a substantial growth of 28.0 per cent in

2019, compared to its growth of 4.6 per cent in

2018.

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), including

loans to projects approved by the Board of

Investment (BOI), decreased by 49.8 per cent to

US dollars 1,188.7 million5 in 2019, compared

to US dollars 2,366.9 million recorded in 2018.

The FDI inflow in 2018 included foreign investment

in relation to the divestiture of the Hambantota

Port. Therefore, relative to 2018, the contraction

in FDI inflows in 2019 was mainly caused by a

reduction in FDI inflows to infrastructure projects

and services sectors, which recorded a drop of

63.7 per cent and 25.6 per cent, respectively.

However, FDI inflows pertaining to the

manufacturing sector, which accounted for more

than one fourth of total FDI inflows during the

period under review, registered a growth of 9.6

per cent to US dollars 319.5 million. In the

meantime, FDI inflows to the agriculture sector

continued to be at marginal levels in 2019 as well.

The total value of projects approved by

the BOI in 2019 under Sections 16 and 17 of

the BOI Act is estimated at Rs. 4,732.7 billion.

Estimated investment inflows to projects approved

in the food, beverages and tobacco, textile,

wearing apparel and leather products, services,

chemicals, petroleum, coal and rubber and plastic

products, non-metallic mineral products, and other

manufactured products sectors registered an

increase during the period under review, compared

to the previous year. However, the investment

value of project approvals in fabricated metal

products, machinery and transport equipment

recorded a decline in 2019, compared to 2018. The

estimated investment value of projects contracted

under Section 17 during 2019 was Rs.865.2 billion

compared to Rs.221.6 billion recorded in the

previous period. Estimated investment in projects

that commenced commercial operations under

Sections 16 and 17 of the BOI Act amounted

to Rs.992.5 billion as at end 2019, reflecting an

increase of 7.4 per cent over the previous period.

The cumulative realised investment of the BOI

by end 2019 was Rs.3,752.0 billion compared to

Rs.3,371.6 billion recorded by end 2018.

Availability and Utilisation of Resources

The total available resources of the economy

at current prices, including both domestic

and external resources, expanded only by

3.7 per cent amounting to Rs. 19,407.9 billion

in 2019, in comparison to the 8.8 per cent

growth recorded in 2018. Both GDP and imports

at current prices grew at a slower pace in 2019

compared to the previous year, reducing the

resource availability of the country. Meanwhile, the

resource availability at constant prices expanded

marginally by 0.4 per cent in 2019 compared to the

2.9 per cent growth recorded in 2018, on account

of the contraction recorded in imports together

with the slower expansion in GDP at constant

prices during the year.

The available resources of the economy

were utilised for consumption and investment

purposes and exports during the year. Most

of the resources were utilised for consumption

purposes, which accounted for 60.9 per cent

of the total resource utilisation at current prices

in 2019, compared to its share of 59.1 per cent

recorded in 2018. In the meantime, the share

of resources utilised for exports increased to

17.9 per cent in 2019, from 17.6 per cent recorded

in 2018. However, the share of resources

utilised for investment purposes decreased to

21.2 per cent in 2019, compared to 23.4 per cent

recorded in 2018.

Savings

Domestic savings of the economy at

current prices recorded a contraction of

3.5 per cent amounting to Rs. 3,193.3 billion in

2019, compared to the growth of 1.9 per cent

recorded in 2018. This could be partly attributable

to the slower growth in private savings which grew

by 3.5 per cent in 2019, compared to its growth of 4.1

per cent in 2018. Further, the substantial increase

in government recurrent expenditure surpassed the

slower increase in government revenue, resulting in

a higher increase in government dis-savings in 2019

compared to the previous year, thereby dampening

the growth in domestic savings. Accordingly, domestic

savings as a percentage of GDP decreased to

21.3 per cent in 2019, compared to its share of 23.0

per cent in 2018.

National savings at current prices contracted

by 3.3 per cent amounting to Rs. 3,791.7 billion

in 2019, compared to the growth of 1.6 per

cent recorded in 2018. This setback was largely

attributable to the contraction witnessed in both

domestic savings and net primary income from the

rest of the world in rupee terms. However, net current

transfers from the rest of the world in rupee terms,

recorded an expansion during the year, driven by the

increase in workers’ remittances. According to these

developments, national savings as a percentage

of GDP decreased to 25.3 per cent in 2019, from

27.3 per cent in 2018. However, due to the higher

contraction in investment expenditure, the national

savings-investment gap narrowed to 2.1 per cent of

GDP in 2019, from 3.1 per cent of GDP in 2018.

2.6 Income

The aggregate of income components which

is equal to the total gross value added of the

economy grew by 6.1 per cent in 2019 at current

prices, compared to the growth of 8.9 per cent

in 2018. Gross Operating Surplus (GOS) which is

the largest income generating component of the

economy grew by 7.2 per cent in 2019, compared

to the growth of 6.1 per cent in 2018, accounting

for 63.1 per cent of GDP. This growth was mainly

attributable to the expansion in Net Operating

Surplus (NOS), the largest sub item within GOS,

which grew by 9.2 per cent in 2019, compared to

the growth of 5.4 per cent in 2018. Considering the

other two sub items of GOS, consumption of fixed

capital grew by 4.4 per cent in 2019 in comparison

to the growth of 5.7 per cent recorded in 2018

while mixed income recorded a contraction of 4.3

per cent in 2019, from the growth of 11.5 per cent

in 2018. Meanwhile, Compensation of Employees

(CE) which accounted for 29.5 per cent of GDP

in 2019 recorded a slower growth of 3.5 per cent

during the year compared to a higher growth of

15.3 per cent in 2018. However, the other income

component, the taxes less subsidies on production

recorded a substantial growth of 43.4 per cent

in 2019, compared to the marginal growth of

0.7 per cent recorded in 2018, accounting for

0.4 per cent of GDP.

According to the institutional sector

classification of income generation, the HH and

to the total gross value added of the economy

at current prices. When considering the sectoral

contribution to GOS, the HH and NPISH sector

represented 57.7 per cent of GOS, recording a

growth of 5.1 per cent in 2019. This was followed by

the NFC sector, which accounted for 35.4 per cent of

GOS and grew by 6.6 per cent in 2019. With regards

to CE, the NFC sector accounted for 34.6 per cent

of CE and grew by 9.9 per cent in 2019. Further, the

HH and NPISH, and GG sectors accounted for 30.6

per cent and 28.2 per cent of CE, respectively, in

2019 and recorded growth rates of 4.5 per cent and

5.6 per cent, respectively. Moreover, the FC sector

contributed for 6.7 per cent of CE and registered

a contraction of 28.0 per cent in 2019. The major

contributor to taxes less subsidies on production

was the NFC sector which accounted for 91.1

per cent of this component and recorded a

considerable growth of 43.4 per cent in 2019.

income generated by improved utilisation of resources 
under the gig economy might not be fully accounted for 
in the official estimates. For example, renting a room of 
a house for a tourist or hiring a vehicle through digital 
platforms  adds  value  to  the  economy,  yet  there  is  no

This  will  lead  to  an  overestimation  of  price  indices.  In 
such  instances,  the  value  added  to  economic  activity, 
estimated 
in 
real 
would  be  underestimated.  Moreover,  sharing  services 
in a gig economy pose challenges for the expenditure 
classification of national accounts, as well. For example, 
personal  use  but  is  utilised  for  an  income-generating 
activity such as ride-sharing, it is difficult to estimate in 
practice the respective proportions related to investment 
and consumption. This leads to an underestimation of

experiment  for  better  sources  of  data  and  indicators 
that  capture  the  impact  and  contribution  of  the  gig 
economy  since 
traditional  sources  and  methods 
use  are  ill-equipped  to  accurately  estimate  economic 
activities  within  the  gig  economy.  In  addressing  this 
issue, advanced countries like Canada have succeeded 
in capturing gig income data to a certain extent using 
‘self-employees’ tax returns’ (Jeon et al., 2019). Further, 
a well-structured household survey that covers multiple 
employment 
income  might  also  be  able 
income  earned  through  gig  work  to  a  greater  extent. 
Moreover,  digital  platforms  that  facilitate  gig  workers 
could be a vital source of data, particularly when a few 
platforms dominate the market.","","","","","","","","Balance

through  the  accumulation  of  farmers’  knowledge  and

many  centuries  in  the  past.  The  cascade  tank-village 
system  (Ellanga  system),  the  hill  side  cascade  paddy 
fields  (Helmalu)  and  the  irrigation  systems  developed 
in the historical past were remarkable agro-biodiversity

against natural disasters such as floods, droughts and 
pest  attacks.  However,  during 
priority  was  given  to  plantation  agriculture  and  little 
attention was paid to other crop cultivations, except for 
subsistence  farming.  With  little  government  attention, 
subsistence farming alone became insufficient to meet 
the growing food demand in the country. Subsequently, 
the green revolution, which was a major policy response 
of  many  developing  nations  in  the  1960s,  sought  to 
increase the efficiency of agricultural processes through 
various techniques such as high yielding robust varieties,

to  labour  intensive  cultivation  activities.  In  addition, 
recent  experiences  of  erratic  weather  patterns  and 
resultant natural disasters, such as droughts and floods, 
tend  to  impose  additional  restrictions  on  agricultural

reach the market. In addition to cold storage, numerous 
food supply chain inefficiencies indicate a disconnection 
between  supplier  and  retailer  in  the  sector.  Blockchain 
technology creates a direct link between all participants 
in the supply chain, ensuring efficiency, traceability and 
transparency at each stage of the production process. For 
example, the government of Thailand has introduced a 
pilot  project  to  use  blockchain  traceability  solutions  for 
organic  rice,  particularly  to  track  and  trace  Thailand’s 
jasmine rice from production to export. In the sequence 
of  technological  developments,  drones  and  automated 
robots have emerged as versatile technologies for smart 
farming activities. Drone technology is used for soil and 
field  analysis,  planting,  crop  spraying,  crop  monitoring 
and  analysis,  irrigation,  and  crop  health  assessments. 
Hence,  drone 
cultivation  activities,  reduces  usage  of  scarce  human 
and other resources, stores data for future analysis and 
increases yields by effective resource usage. Farmers of 
Andhra Pradesh in India, for instance, have commenced 
offer agriculture survey services to insurance companies 
as well as the government to efficiently implement crop 
insurance 
schemes. 
In 
addition, 
advanced 
robotic 
systems, such as weeding robots, driverless tractors and 
soil  sterilisation  robots,  are  used  in  agriculture  fields 
for  supplying  inputs,  land  preparation,  weed  control, 
pruning,  seeding,  spraying, 
thinning,  harvesting  and 
picking, and sorting and packing. Therefore, drone and 
robot technologies support farmers for efficient resource 
management while reducing cost of production through 
reduced labour usage. 
Today, nanotechnology has grown into a mature field of 
science, and it has a wide variety of potential applications 
in  agriculture.  Nanotechnology  broadly  refers  to  a  field 
of  applied  science  and  technology  that  aims  to  control 
matter at the molecular level in scale, usually in the range 
of one to 100 nanometers, and create devices within that 
size range (ScienceDaily, 2020). Nanotechnology is used 
in  all  stages  of  farm  activities  such  as  production,  value 
addition,  storage  and  packaging,  and  transportation  of 
agricultural  products.  The  application  of  nanomaterials, 
such as nanocapsules and nanoparticles, especially aims 
at  efficient  usage  of  plant  protection  products  through 
enhanced plant absorption and delivery of ingredients to 
specific  sites.  For  example,  fertiliser  applied  in  the  form 
of  nanomaterial  minimises  nutrient  losses  by  slow  and 
controlled release of substances, and thereby increases yield 
via optimised resource usage and reduces environmental","stage  of  crop  cultivation  as  well  as  weather  forecasts,

"competition.  Concerns  over 
the  adaptability  of  new 
technologies  have  shifted  the  agriculture  sector  from 
technologies, limited capital to make initial investment 
more  production  centric  activities 
to  market  centric 
activities  in  view  of  balancing  production  and  market 
demand conditions.  
Current  Status  of  New  Technology  Adoption  in 
Sri Lanka
Advanced 
technology 
usage 
agriculture 
sector 
is 
limited,  not  only  among 
farmers,  but  also  among  the  agribusinesses.  With  the 
aim  of  using  Information  Communication  Technology 
for productivity improvements in the agriculture sector, 
several  e-agriculture  programmes  such  as  interactive 
ICT  and  mobile  platforms  and  software  applications 
have been already developed to disseminate agriculture 
information.  Few  e-agriculture  services  such  as 
Wikigoviya  web,  AgMIS  (an  SMS  service  and  market 
price 
information 
system),  Boga  Purokathanaya 
mobile  phone  App 
that  provides  advice 
on  crops  that  should  be  cultivated  to  receive  a  better 
market price), SL paddy fertiliser (a mobile phone App 
that  provides 
fertiliser 
recommendations 
and  Govipola  (a  mobile  phone  App  that  supports  the 
farming  community  by  strengthening  market  linkages, 
improving  price  awareness  and  matching  supply  and 
demand to give easy access to markets) are currently in 
operation in Sri Lanka, as initiatives of the Department of 
Agriculture and several private institutions. Meanwhile, 
a seed and planting material management information 
system,  a  QR  code  system  for  GAP  certification,  and 
a  progress  monitoring  system  for  the  National  Food 
Production programme are currently being developed. 
In  addition,  the  Sri  Lanka  Institute  of  Nanotechnology 
(SLINTEC)  is  carrying  out  numerous  nanotechnology 
related research and development activities to produce 
slow-release 
fertiliser, 
nanofungicidal 
remediation 
and 
rehabilitation. 
private tech companies in Sri Lanka have also initiated 
several  technological  solutions  to  agricultural  matters, 
such as drone technology and smart weather solutions 
(e.g.  WeatherGuru).  Amidst 
movement of people and gatherings during the ongoing 
COVID-19  pandemic,  smart  technologies  and  social 
media  have  been  put  to  use  increasingly  to  support 
the 
agriculture 
supply 
chain, 
retailers  and  end  consumers.  In  the  same  vein,  smart 
technologies can be effectively used to link agriculture 
producers with markets to manage harvesting periods, 
reduce  postharvest 
losses  and  wastage  and  ensure 
better price realisation for the farming community. 
However,  research  and  development  initiatives  of  Sri 
Lanka’s private sector in relation to advanced agriculture 
technologies  are 
still 
limited 
companies and a broad based use is yet to be realised. 
Further, agriculture firms as well as farmers in Sri Lanka
