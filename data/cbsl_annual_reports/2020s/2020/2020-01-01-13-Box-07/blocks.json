On the one hand, these countries are unable to compete with low wage, poor economies who have labour intensive, imitation driven merchandise export sectors. Conversely, they also fail to compete with advanced economies that export innovation driven manufactured goods produced using highly productive skilled labour. As a result, these middle income countries do not make a timely transition from resource led growth to productivity driven growth, and this phenomenon is termed the \u2018middle income trap\u2019. Escaping the middle income trap is challenging for Sri Lanka as well, but is crucial for the country to achieve a sustainable, high growth path.",

A good education system equips the labour force with marketable skills while spurring innovations and productivity growth. Often, public investment in a country is aimed at improving the general level of education. For example, Sri Lanka adopted an education policy to offer free education at primary, secondary and tertiary levels in 1945, and today the country enjoys an impressively high literacy rate among both males (93.4 per cent in 2018) and females (91.6 per cent in 2018). Although increasing literacy levels are important for the country to move ahead of the regional peers in terms of human development; as Figure B 9.1 depicts, the country still lags behind in terms of innovation and competitiveness, factors which are core to accelerate economic growth during the middle income stage.",

    "text": "With economic development, skills requirements in an economy also evolve over time. Therefore, education policies and investments need to be dynamically adjusted to align with the evolving skills requirements of the economy, in order to achieve simultaneous progress in human and economic development. If the education system is not aligned with the economic growth needs, the country will face persistent skills gaps and mismatches hindering further economic growth. Persistent skills gaps and mismatches can hamper economic growth in three ways: first, firms will not be able to expand their operations and compete in global markets without the required skilled labour; second, firms will be restricted to lower rungs of global value chains as they fail to upgrade their technologies; third, lack of skilled labour will discourage foreign direct investment inflows. Countries such as Singapore and South Korea, which successfully evaded the middle income trap, have implemented major education sector reforms from time to time and phased in public education investments to align their education system with the needs of the evolving economy. For example, from 1965 to 1978, Singapore\u2019s education policies were striving to provide universal access to primary and secondary education and enhance technical skills that are essential for labour intensive production. But with the intensifying competition for labour intensive exports from their regional peers, during the 1980s, Singapore focused on equipping the labour force with skills that are needed for capital intensive production. Since the 1990s, Singapore has gradually transformed into a knowledge based economy. In parallel, the country\u2019s education policies refocused on strengthening tertiary education by establishing new universities, building partnerships with foreign universities and improving labour productivity through innovation. However, replication of the education system reforms of these successful countries within the Sri Lankan economy may not be feasible without suitable adjustments, since many socio-economic factors in Sri Lanka, such as the level of human development, structure",

There are significant regional disparities in terms of availability of science A/L classes.

There are considerable disparities in skilled teacher availability across national and provincial schools as well as across regions indicating the issues in teacher deployment. For example, national schools have more than the required number of science teachers while provincial schools have a shortage. Both national and provincial schools in Western, Central, Southern and North-Western provinces have more than the required number of skilled English teachers, though schools in other provinces experience a dearth of skilled teachers for the subject (Arunatilake and Abayasekara, 2017, pp.16-17).",

However, Sri Lanka\u2019s TVET sector is plagued by a myriad of shortcomings resulting in lower efficiency of the sector in terms of meeting the country\u2019s skill demand. Currently, the TVET sector is highly fragmented and poorly coordinated with a large number of state and non-state education providers (1,290 registered TVET institutions by end 2019), and numerous governing agencies with their own regulatory panels and procedures. Since there is no central planning mechanism for the TVET sector, the designing of training programmes, student enrolment, and quality standards and accreditations are not aligned with the country\u2019s growth policies and labour market needs. Although the National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) system has been introduced with the aim of defining training standards on the basis of occupational requirements, the quality assurance process in the TVET system is still not fully effective since many private TVET institutions are neither accredited nor registered.

In this regard, emphasis of the education system should be on STEM fields as well as improving English literacy, which are crucial in building linkages with the global markets.

Equitable access to STEM and English education is vital to achieve inclusive economic growth. Resource allocation to national schools and provincial schools are primarily made through the Central Government and Provincial Councils, respectively, which inevitably results in large disparities in physical resource allocation and teacher deployment across schools. Hence, resource and teacher cadre requirements and shortages at school level should be monitored through a central database system. Further, the allocation of resources and teacher deployment should be made on a needs basis through a central mechanism. An incentive scheme needs to be introduced for teachers in STEM fields to work in underprivileged schools.

Since the state sector alone cannot meet the skill demand in the economy, private sector engagement in tertiary education, supported by strong quality assurance and accreditation mechanisms, is vital to raise higher education and TVET enrolment rates. Further, concessionary education loans5 should be promoted to encourage students who are unable to enrol in state universities to pursue higher education opportunities through non-state higher education institutions. The education/ training cost per student in STEM fields is generally high, since resources such as laboratories and equipment are costly though the resources may not be fully utilised due to the limited number of students/ trainees in one institution. Hence, resource sharing among several training institutions, particularly through public private partnerships, would be more effective in reducing per student training costs.",

A swift transition from school to employment ensures that fresh entrants to the labour market are young at the inception of employment. Generally, educated youth are more innovative, open for change and more risk-taking, which are essential qualities of a labour force for innovation led growth. Reduction in administrative inefficiencies in releasing examination results and student enrolments, prevention of disruptions to the university system caused by students and staff union action and a possible reduction in the number of years of schooling can significantly reduce the average age of Sri Lankan graduates. In addition, fallback options, such as diploma programmes within the normal undergraduate degree programme, also should be popularised to cater to students who are not willing to spend a long time in education. Tertiary education enrolments can be further increased by offering different trajectories to achieve the same level of education, creating flexibility within the education system to accommodate transitions between work and study as well as between educational programmes, and promoting lifelong learning.",

Further, building linkages with domestic and foreign companies is essential to engage in market demanded research activities, and dissemination and commercialisation of research findings. Research grants need to be allocated by the University Grant Commission and research grant committees of the universities considering the impact of research work, which is measured not only in terms of research publications but also based on the commercial value and policy implications of research work.",

In this regard, offering STEM courses such as mathematics, statistics and ICT modules in non-STEM degree programmes will enhance the employability of graduates. Currently, the government has made a policy decision to promote STEAM education, where A stands for Arts subjects, at the general and higher education level with the objective of allowing students to learn STEM in a creative manner by integrating with the Arts. This policy also aims to enhance employability of Arts graduates.",
