a) Liquidity 
is  a 
key 
consideration 
in  determining 
the 
operations, 
the  Bank  uses  highly 
liquid  marketable 
composition  of 
the  Bank’s 
foreign 
currency  assets. 
This 
reflects 
the  potential 
requirement 
to 
liquidate 
instruments such as Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds as 
foreign  reserves  for  intervention  purposes  and  to  settle 
collateral.  It  manages  the  daily  liquidity  position  of  the 
other  commitments  such  as  public  debt  and  IMF  Loan 
banking system by way of infusing into or withdrawal from 
repayments when the need arises. The Bank has adopted 
the system, using instruments such as repo/reverse repo, 
the following measures aimed at ensuring quick access to 
funds:
CBSL securities and USD/LKR Swaps.
