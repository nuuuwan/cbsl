This account was created under the guidance of the IMF by transferring the balance held in SCA-2 against Sri Lanka when it was decided to wind up SCA-2 by the IMF. The IMF requested the countries that had balances in the Post SCA-2 account to consider providing the balances in that account to the PRGF/HIPC Trust either as outright grant or as a means of providing a subsidy for PRGF/HIPC Loan. Accordingly GOSL agreed to transfer the funds from Post SCA \u20132 accounts to PRGF/HIPC Trust account, not as an outright grant, but as an interest free deposit until 2018. This was later extended until 2024.",

It is assigned only in the case of exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitment. AA is very high quality grade, indicating very low expectation of credit risk and A is an upper medium grade, indicating a low expectation of credit risk, BBB is the lowest investment grade rating, indicating that there is currently a low expectation of credit risk and exhibits adequate protection parameters, ratings lower than AAA can be modified by + or \u2013 signs to indicate relative standing within the major categories. NR indicates that Standard and Poor\u2019s or Fitch Rating have not rated the entity.",

The MD measures the change in price of a security for a 1% change in the interest rates (yield). A higher MD indicates a higher risk. Hence, the Bank sets an appropriate MD from time to time considering the developments in the financial markets, portfolio characteristics and the risk appetite of the bond portfolio.

This portfolio is not an investment portfolio, as the Bank does not purchase Government Securities with the intention of earning an interest income. The Bank purchases or sells Government Securities to inject rupee liquidity into the domestic market or to absorb liquidity from the market in the course of carrying out its monetary policy operations in relation to one of its core objectives, maintaining economic and price stability. Hence, the volume of Government Securities in the Bank\u2019s portfolio is determined by its monetary policy operations. In addition, the basic interest rates in the rupee market, the Repo rate and the Reverse Repo rate are policy rates determined by the Bank in the course of implementing its monetary policy. Moreover, the Bank\u2019s actions in injecting rupee liquidity or absorbing liquidity from the market have a significant impact on general rupee market interest rates. Thus, changes in the interest income earned from the Government Securities portfolio, which arise from changes in the volume of the Bank\u2019s Government Securities portfolio, as well as changes in interest rates, are primarily a consequence of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy actions, rather than due to investment decisions. Therefore, the Bank does not consider interest rate sensitivities arising from local currency assets.",

Currently a selected Clearing House (CH) functions as the custodian for the supranational bonds and bonds issued by different issuers. CBSL has signed an agreement which enable CH to lend at their wish depending on the demand for those bonds. Since the lending does not involve CBSL and CH lends them directly to the borrowers, the process is called auto bond lending. At the end of each month, custodian will send fee income for auto bond lending, if any for the bonds which they lent under auto bond lending programme. The Bank continues to recognize the securities in their entirety in the Statement of Financial Position because it retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership.

Further, coins for the value of Rs. 1 billion were issued to LCBs and public counters established at Pettah Branch of Bank of Ceylon and currency counters at the Central Bank (Table II-6). The decrease in currency note issues in 2019 in comparison to the previous year was mainly due to the large volume of new notes issued during 2018 consequent to the strict implementation of the policy on willfully mutilated and defaced currency notes. Issuance of coins has slightly decreased in 2019 reflecting a low demand for coins among the public.",

With the view to strengthening the monetary policy decision making process by incorporating inputs from the experts in academia and the private sector, ERD continued to facilitate the meetings of the Monetary Policy Consultative Committee (MPCC). Moreover, ERD coordinated the preparation of the annual policy statement Road Map 2020 - Monetary and Financial Sector Policies for 2020 and Beyond, in which the Central Bank announced its policies for monetary and financial sectors in the medium term, thereby providing information to all stakeholders in the economy and the financial market on the policy direction of the Central Bank in the period ahead.

Further, ERD enlightened the senior management on various economic issues and appropriate policy measures required to maintain macroeconomic stability. The impact of announced fiscal measures on various sectors of the economy was also analysed and informed to the senior management to support the decision making process. Moreover, ERD continued to improve its inhouse modelling and forecasting capacity and infrastructure with technical assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), aimed at enhancing the monetary policy decision making and communication process further. ERD took several measures to improve external communication and enhance awareness among the general public and other stakeholders aimed at anchoring inflation expectations in line with the envisaged inflation path over the medium term. ERD continued the publication of press releases on Monetary Policy Review informing the general public of the stance of the Monetary Board. Further, ERD performed a lead role in monetary policy press conferences chaired by the Governor and attended by senior officials of the Central Bank, which provided a platform for stakeholders to receive first hand information and obtain clarifications on the monetary policy stance, and the commencement of livestreaming of the press conference proceedings in 2019 enabled a wider reach of monetary policy communication on a real time basis.",

Accordingly, during the year, EPF Department conducted 16 mobile services and 02 major awareness programmes. Some of these mobile services were conducted in collaboration with the Department of Labour (DL), Department of Registration of Persons, Registrar General\u2019s Department, Police Department and the respective District/Divisional Secretariats. EPF Department also participated in mobile services organised by other government and non-government organisations/ministries upon the invitation of them to provide EPF related services and awareness to the participants. The mobile services offered almost all services a member could obtain by visiting EPF Department located in Colombo, in their own area or at their workplace. The services included issuing of EPF balance statements, amendment of EPF member details, clearing of dummy numbers, EPF account amendments, awareness for employers on E-media and direct debit system, re-registration of member details, promoting SMS & internet member services and providing advice on overall EPF procedures. In addition, awareness activities were conducted in parallel to the mobile services, targeting members, employers and other stakeholders, on the services offered by EPF Department using a mix of communication media such as e-mail, posters, leaflets, video clips and presentations. In this regard, prior to each mobile service programme, a special awareness programme was conducted for relevant employers, managers and other administrative staff members of respective employers with a view of enhancing the effectiveness of the mobile services.",

In addition, MSD also engaged in an interconnectedness study which identified the contagion risks of the banking sector. In view of the need for monitoring credit quality of the financial system and its evolution over time, MSD employed probability density functions for Non-Performing Loans (NPLs), which indicate the possibility of rising tail risk of deterioration in asset quality to the financial system. MSD constructed a Financial Stress Index during the year to identify periods when strains on the financial system impair its intermediation function. This index combines indicators from the equities market, bond market, foreign exchange market and banking sector into a composite index to assess the degree of stress in the financial system. MSD also continued to compile a number of composite financial system stability indicators based on the stability and soundness of different sub sectors of the domestic financial system while also taking steps to improve the reliability of these indices. In addition to continuation of the banking sector top-down macro stress testing to assess the impact of credit risk, interest rate risk, and foreign exchange risk on the level of capital of the banking system and also individual banks, MSD expanded the scope of stress testing to cover the Licensed Finance Companies sector. MSD submitted a number of papers to the Monetary Board containing risk assessments which allow identification of possible threats to the stability of the financial system, and other contemporary concerns over financial system stability during 2019.",

Accordingly, a resolution was passed by the Parliament in July 2019 to raise up to Rs. 480 billion for liability management purposes under the ALMA. The liability management initiatives enable the government to proactively address part of the future refinancing requirements ahead of time by reducing rollover peaks and extending the maturity duration and/or smoothening repayments structure of ISBs and other debt maturities. In general, liability management will help the government to diversify the investor base, provide opportunities to streamline the cost of borrowing based on market conditions, extend the duration of the liability portfolio, reduce refinancing risk in the near term and create a favourable price tension for any new issuances. In this regard, PDD initiated raising funds and building required buffers in the domestic market by executing its first liability management based T-bonds issuance amounting to Rs. 15 billion in October 2019 and another Rs. 15 billion in December 2019. The buffers built in 2019 are expected to be utilised for settlement of debt service obligations during the early part of 2020. The government also initiated preliminary work with respect to accessing alternative Sovereign bond markets in the latter part of 2019.",
