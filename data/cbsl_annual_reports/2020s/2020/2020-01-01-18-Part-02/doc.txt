Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2019Part II - 4

The Central Bank was established as the authority responsible for the administration, supervision and regulation of the monetary, financial and payment systems of Sri Lanka under the Monetary Law Act. In accordance with this Act, the Bank is charged with the responsibility of securing the core objectives of economic and price stability and financial system stability.

The basis of accountability for the Central Bank and the success of its operations therefore would be the effectiveness of its policies and operations leading towards the achievement of its core objectives and not necessarily its profitability. These statutory objectives are the fundamental features that distinguish the Central Bank from any other entity, private or public. Accordingly, profitability related approach, if adopted by the Central Bank, could result in the Bank pursuing profits while compromising its core objectives, since it has the unique ability to create its own profits through its monetary policy activities, which could influence interest rates and exchange rates. It therefore

Central Bank of Sri LankaManagement StatementFor the period ended 31 December 2019

Accountability and the Financial Performance of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in relation to the Objectives

follows that the Central Bank’s objectives of economic and price stability and financial system stability need to be distinguished and detached from the pure profitability objective which should essentially be incidental or academic only.

In this background, the Central Bank’s financial statements record gains and/or deficits in the implementation of its monetary policy operations, exchange rate management, issuing of currency, etc. at the values as realized and hence, the financial performance as reported in these statements needs to be interpreted and understood in that context.

The Bank is subject to an external audit by the Auditor General under the Monetary Law Act sections 42 & 43. The Auditor General in turn has obtained the services of a firm of Chartered Accountants, M/s KPMG, to carry out an audit under International Standards of Auditing to ensure compliance with the International Financial Reporting Standards.

The Monetary Board of the CBSL is, in addition to determining the policies or measures authorized to be adopted or taken under Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949 of Sri Lanka as amended, vested with the powers, duties and functions of the CBSL and are generally responsible for the management, operations and administration of the Bank. The Bank is primarily responsible for the administration, supervision, regulation of monetary, financial and payment system of Sri Lanka and also acts as the fiscal agent of the Government. The activities of the Bank mainly include:

• Implementing monetary and exchange rate

polices. • Issuing of currency. • Management of the official international reserves. • Oversight of the financial system. • Licensing, regulating and supervising of banks

and selected Non- Bank Financial Institutions. • Provision of settlement facilities and the

regulation of the payment system. • Compilation, dissemination and analysis of

economic data and statistics. • Providing loans and advances to the Government,

bank and financial institutions under various facilities. • Banker to the government and its agencies, and

provision of current account facilities to LCBs and non-commercial bank primary dealers for government securities.

The activities carried out in order to achieve its objective of economic, price and financial system stability with a view to encouraging and promoting the development of the productive resources of Sri Lanka can be broadly segregated into foreign currency and local currency

activities. Results of these activities are taken to Operating Activities in the context of the Statement of Income.

2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2.1 Statement of Compliance

These financial statements of the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2019 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

This is the first set of the Financial Statements in which IFRS 16 – “Leases” has been applied. Changes to significant accounting policies are described in Note 4.

2.2 Basis of Measurement

The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the following,

• Gold is measured at fair value through profit

or loss (FVTPL).

• Derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) are measured at fair value.

• Land and buildings are measured at cost

at the time of acquisition and subsequently at revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

• Liability for defined benefit obligations is

measured as the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the plan assets.

2.3 Reporting Format

The Bank presents financial assets and financial liabilities, and their associated income and expense streams, by distinguishing between foreign currency and local currency operations. In the Statement of Financial Position, assets and liabilities are presented broadly in order of liquidity within such distinguished categories. The Bank considers that this reporting approach provides appropriate reporting of the Bank’s activities which are more fully described in Note 7.

2.4 Functional and Presentation Currency

The Financial Statements are presented in Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR), which is the Bank’s functional currency. Financial information presented in Sri Lankan Rupees has been rounded to the nearest thousand. There was no change in the Bank’s presentation and functional currency during the year under review.

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

2.5 Materiality and Aggregation

Each material class of similar item is presented separately in the Financial Statements. Items of dissimilar nature or function are presented separately unless they are immaterial.

2.6 Offsetting

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in Statement of Financial Position when, and only when, the Bank has a legal right to set off the recognized amounts and it intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

2.7 Comparative Information

The comparative information is reclassified whenever necessary to conform with the current year’s presentation.

3. USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

The preparation of the Bank’s financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities.

Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively. Information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognized in the financial statements are described in the following notes.

3.1 Classification and Impairment of Financial

Assets

The Bank used judgements when assessing of the business model within which the assets are held and whether the contractual terms of the financial assets are solely-payment-of-principal-and-interest (SPPI) on the principal amount of the outstanding. The Bank also used judgements when establishing the criteria for determining whether credit risk on the financial assets has increased significantly since initial recognition, determining methodology for incorporating forward looking information into measurement of Expected Credit Losses (ECL) and selection and approval of models to measure ECL.

3.2 Pensions and Other Post Employment Benefit

Plans

The cost of defined benefit plans is determined using an actuarial valuation. The actuarial valuation involves

making assumptions about discount rates, future compensation increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. Assumptions used in the actuarial valuation are disclosed in Note 32 to the Financial Statements.

3.3 Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Where the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the Statement of Financial Position cannot be derived from active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. The inputs to these models are derived from observable market data where possible, but if this is not available, judgment is required to establish fair values. The judgments include considerations of liquidity and model inputs such as volatility for longer–dated derivatives.

4. CHANGES TO SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

There were no changes to the accounting policies and accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except for the IFRS 16 “Leases” related policies mentioned in detail below.

4.1 IFRS 16 - Leases

The Bank initially applied IFRS 16 “Leases” from 1 January 2019 modified retrospective approach (Option B). Therefore, the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under IAS 17 Leases and IFRIC 4 “Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease”.

The effect of initially applying this standard mainly attributed to the following;

• recognition of right-of-use assets• recognition of corresponding lease liabilities

The impact on classification and measurement of leases due to adoption of IFRS 16 is disclosed in Note 8. Except for the changes below, the Bank has consistently applied the accounting policies as set out in Note 5 to all periods presented in these Financial Statements.

Definition of a lease

Previously, the Bank determined at contract inception whether an arrangement is or contains a lease under IAS 17. Under IFRS 16, the Bank assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease based on the definition of a lease, as explained in Note 5.22.

On transition to IFRS 16, the Bank elected to apply the practical expedient to the assessment of which transactions are leases. It applied IFRS 16 only to contracts that were previously identified as leases.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2019Part II - 15

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

Accounting treatment by lessee

As a lessee, the Bank previously classified leases as operating or finance leases based on its assessment of whether the lease transferred significantly all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset to the Bank. Under IFRS 16, the Bank recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for the leases – i.e. these leases are on-balance sheet.

a) Leases previously classified as operating leases

under IAS 17

Previously the Bank classified property leases as operating leases under IAS 17. On transition, lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted at the Bank’s incremental borrowing rate as at 1 January 2019. Right-of-use assets are measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments. The Bank applied this approach to all the leases.

The Bank has tested its right-of-use assets for impairment on the date of transition and has concluded that there is no indication that the right-of-use assets are impaired.

The Bank used the following practical expedients when applying IFRS 16 to leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17.

• Applied a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases

with similar characteristics.• Excluded initial direct costs from measuring the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application.• Used hindsight when determining the lease term if the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease.

Impact on financial statements

On transition to IFRS 16, the Bank recognized additional right-of-use assets and additional lease liabilities of which the quantitative impact as at 1 January 2019 is disclosed in Note 8.

5. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting policies have been applied consistently by the Bank, except for the changes in accounting policies described in Note 4.

5.1 Foreign Currency Translations and Balances

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to Sri Lankan Rupees at the rate of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated to Sri Lankan Rupees at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date. The foreign currency translation gain or loss on monetary items are taken to the

Statement of Income. For the purposes of retranslation, as at the reporting date, the following Sri Lanka Rupee exchange rates for major currencies were used:

Currency2019Rs.2018Rs. 1 Australian Dollar127.5343128.81131 Canadian Dollar139.8206134.01531 Euro203.6571209.55931 Japanese Yen1.67241.66611 Special Drawing Rights (SDR)250.7887253.51111 Sterling Pound240.7922233.07921 United States Dollar181.6340182.74991 Chinese Yuan (Offshore)26.090526.5988

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

5.2 Fair Value Measurement

The Bank measures financial instruments, such as, foreign securities, derivatives, and non-financial assets such as Gold, at fair value at each reporting date. The fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in Note 51.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

• In the principal market for the asset or liability, or

• In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability

The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Bank.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The Bank uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2019Part II - 16

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.

Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Bank determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

5.3 Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

The Bank presents financial assets and liabilities, and the associated income and expense streams, by distinguishing between foreign currency and local currency activities.

Foreign currency activities mainly arise from the Bank’s foreign reserves management function. Local currency activities mainly reflect the assets and liabilities associated with monetary policy implementation, issuing currency and banking activities.

The separate reporting of these activities is considered to provide a better presentation of the Bank’s financial position, financial performance and risk profile. The Bank considers that the combined reporting of foreign and local currency activities would weaken the informational value of the financial statements.

5.3.1 Recognition and Initial Measurement

All financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and including acquisition charges associated with the investment. All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the trade date respectively. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the market place.

5.3.2 Classification

Financial Assets

On initial recognition, Bank classifies the financial assets as measured at;

• Amortized Cost

• Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income

(FVOCI)

• Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)

A financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL

• The asset is held within a business model whose

objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and

• The contractual terms of the financial asset give

rise on specified dates to cashflows that are Solely Payment of Principle and Interest.

A financial asset is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL.

• The asset is held within a business model whose

objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and

• The contractual terms of the financial asset give

rise on specified dates to cashflows that are Solely Payment of Principle and Interest.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. All other financial assets are classified as measured at FVTPL.

Business Model Assessment

The Bank makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The information considered includes but not limited to:

• How the performance of the business model and

the financial assets held within that business model are evaluated and reported to the entity’s key management personnel.

• The risks that affect the performance of the

business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way those risks are managed.

• The frequency, volume and timing of sales in

prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realized.

Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2019Part II - 17

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

Assessment of whether Contractual Cash Flows are Solely Payments of Principal and Interest

The Bank assesses the contractual terms of financial assets to identify whether they meet the SPPI test. For the purpose of this assessment, “Principal” is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and “Interest” is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs.

The most significant elements of interest within a lending arrangement are typically the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk. To make the SPPI assessment, the Bank applies judgement and considers relevant factors such as the currency in which the financial asset is denominated, and the period for which the interest rate is set.

In contrast, contractual terms that introduce a more than the minimum exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that are unrelated to a basic lending arrangement do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the amount outstanding. In such cases, the financial asset is required to be measured at FVTPL.

Reclassifications

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the Bank changes its business model for managing financial assets.

5.3.3 Derecognition

Financial Assets

Bank derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised) and the sum of (i) the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI is recognised in profit or loss.

Any cumulative gain/loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated as at FVOCI is

not recognised in profit or loss on derecognition of such securities. Any interest in transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created or retained by the Bank is recognised as a separate asset or liability.

The Bank enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognized on its Statement of Financial Position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets or a portion of them. In such cases, the transferred assets are not derecognized. Examples of such transactions are securities lending and sale-and-repurchase transactions. In transactions in which the Bank neither retains nor transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset and it retains control over the asset, the Bank continues to recognize the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset.

Financial Liabilities

The Bank derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired.

5.3.4 Impairment of Financial Assets

The Bank recognizes loss allowances for ECL on the following financial instruments that are not measured at FVTPL:

• Financial assets at Fair Value through Other

Comprehensive Income

• Financial Assets at Amortized Cost

• Credit guarantee contracts of Regional Development

Department

No impairment loss is recognized on equity investments.

The Bank measures loss allowances at an amount equal to 12 months ECL for investments which are in investment grade (rated Baa3/BBB- and above). Majority of the investments of the bank which are classified as Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income and Amortized cost are above Baa3/BBB- rate. Financial instruments for which a 12-month ECL is recognised are referred to as “Stage 1 financial instruments”.

Life time ECL is calculated for those instruments which are below the investment grade at initial recognition or whose credit risk deteriorates below Baa3/BBB- or when a doubling of the probability of default has ocurred after initial recognition. Financial instruments for which a lifetime ECL is recognised but which are not credit-impaired are referred to as “Stage 2 financial instruments”. Life time ECL would also be computed for credit impaired assets which would be referred to as “Stage 3 financial instruments”.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2019Part II - 18

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

Measurement of ECL

The mechanism of the ECL calculations are outlined below with the key elements.

Probability of Default (PD): The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility has not been previously derecognized and is still in the portfolio. The bank uses specific equity PD’s of issuers/counterparties from Bloomberg for all its foreign investments at FVOCI and amortized cost and in the absence of equity PDs, the PD’s applicable to the rating of the specific issuer/counterparty from the Bloomberg common PD table at a given reporting date.

Exposure at Default: The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected draw downs on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments.

Loss Given Default: The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. The Bank has an approved internal policy in applying the LGD for different types of Financial Assets based on their risk exposure to the bank.

Economic Factor Adjustment: Bank uses the Economic Factor Adjustment for the conversion of through the cycle PD to Point in Time PD and the Bank mainly uses GDP data as the main economic factor in stimulating the PD.

Assessing the Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR)

Bank will consider that the financial instruments have Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) when doubling of PD has occurred from initial recognition and any rating downgrade below BBB- after initial recognition. This is based on the observation that all ratings downgrades from an investment grade rating to a non-investment grade rating, including the marginal one notch downgrade from Baa3 to Ba1, results in a two-fold or greater increase of PD.

Credit-impaired financial assets

At each reporting date, the Bank assesses whether financial assets carried at amortized cost, at FVOCI, and credit guarantees are credit-impaired (referred to as “Stage 3 financial assets”). A financial asset is “credit-impaired”when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

• significant financial difficulty of the borrower or

issuer;• a breach of contract such as a default or past due

event;• it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter

bankruptcy or other financial reorganization

Presentation of allowance for ECL in the Statement of Financial Position

Loss allowances for ECL are presented in the Statement of Financial Position as follows:

• Financial assets measured at amortised cost: as a

deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets.• Investments measured at FVOCI: no loss allowance

is recognised in the Statement of Financial Position because the carrying amount of these assets is their fair value. However, the loss allowance is disclosed and is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. • Credit guarantee contracts: generally, as a provision.

Write-off

Loans and debt securities are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when the Bank determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment is carried out at the individual asset level. Recoveries of amounts previously written off are included in “impairment losses on financial instruments” in the Statement of Income and OCI.

5.4 Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit

or Loss

Financial assets classified as held for trading are included in the category “securities at fair value through profit or loss”. Upon initial recognition, attributable transaction cost are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. These securities are subsequently valued at quoted market prices. Changes in market values are recognised as an increase or decrease in the value of the securities in the Statement of Financial Position while resulting gains and losses are recognised in the Statement of Income.

Where the security is still owned, the gain or loss is reported as “Gain/(Loss) from Unrealised Price Revaluations”. Where the gain or loss has been realised (through selling the security), it is reported as “Gain/(Loss) from realised Price Revaluations”.

5.5 Financial Assets at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income

Investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income are non-derivative investments that are designated

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2019Part II - 19

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

as Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income or are not classified as another category of financial assets. Investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income comprise equity securities and debt securities.

Foreign Currency debt securities at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income are subsequently valued at quoted market prices. Changes in market value are recognized as an increase or decrease in the value of the Investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income in the Statement of Financial Position.

The equity investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income are subsequently valued based on the Net Assets of the respective institutions due to the non-availability of quoted prices.

Gains and losses arising from changes in the market value of Foreign and Local Currency debt securities and Equity Investments at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income are recognised directly in equity (Other Comprehensive Income) which is shown under Other Reserves in the Statement of Financial Position until the investment is sold, collected or otherwise disposed of, or until the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported as equity is included in Statement of Income with the exception of fair value changes in equity investments which will not be recycled to Statement of Income upon derecognition. Interest income is recognised in Statement of Income using the effective interest method.

5.6 Instruments held at Amortized Cost

The items that are held within the business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cashflows and the contractual terms give rise to cash flows on specific dates that are solely principle and interest are classified as instruments held at amortized cost. These instruments are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

5.7 Derivative Instruments

The Bank uses derivatives such as cross currency swaps, currency options, forward foreign exchange contracts, for risk management purposes and not for speculative purposes. Derivatives are recorded at fair value and carried as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are included in “Gain/(Loss) from Unrealized Price Revaluations”.

When the transaction price differs from the fair value of other observable current market transactions in the same instrument, or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets, the Bank immediately recognises the difference between the transaction price and fair value (a Day 1 difference) in “Gain/(Loss) from Unrealized Price Revaluations”. In cases where fair value is determined using data which

is not observable, the difference between the transaction price and model value is only recognised in the Statement of Income when inputs become observable, or when the instrument is derecognised.

5.8 International Monetary Fund (IMF) Related Balances

The Bank transacts with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its own right rather than as the depository of the Government of Sri Lanka. All transactions by the Bank with the IMF have been included in these Financial Statements on that basis.

The bank records the quota with the IMF as an asset and the amount payable to the IMF for quota is recorded as a liability of the bank. The cumulative allocation of SDRs by the IMF is treated as a liability. The IMF quota asset and the SDR holding is classified as FVTPL while other IMF related assets and liabilities are recognized at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Exchange gains and losses arising on revaluation of IMF assets and liabilities at the exchange rate applying at reporting date as published by the IMF are recognised in the Statement of Income.

All other charges and interest pertaining to balances with the IMF are recorded immediately in the Statement of Income.

5.9 Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at foreign banks and financial institutions, short-term deposits and highly liquid financial assets with original maturities of less than three months, which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in their fair value, and are used by the Bank in the management of its short-term commitments. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortized cost in the Statement of Financial Position.

As a part of local currency activities CBSL generates certain income and incurs expenses, which do not involve in movement of cash. Those activities result in certain assets and liabilities and mainly comprise of the transactions with the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) and transactions with domestic banks and financial institutions. Transactions with GOSL include the purchase of Treasury bills and bonds that are issued by the Government as a monetary policy mechanism. Such purchases, disposals or interest thereon are reflected as mere book entries in the records of CBSL. These are disclosed separately in Note 45 and Note 46 to the Financial Statements.

As the sole statutory authority, CBSL issues currency to the public in line with Monetary Law Act. Currency issued by CBSL represents a claim on the Bank in favor of the holder. This is a liability on the part of the CBSL while it is an item of cash in the hands of the holder. Movement in circulation currency is included as part of financing activities in line with prevailing industry practices among those central banks which present cash flow statements.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2019Part II - 20

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

CBSL through the cash/pay order process disburses cash in the form of notes and coins or cheques drawn on CBSL, to various drawees including suppliers and employees for goods and services obtained, which is either added to the currency in circulation liability or Deposits by banks and financial institutions. Such forms of utilization of currency for the purposes of CBSL’s payments form part of cash outflows of CBSL.

For the purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of cash/ pay order outflows.

5.10 Repurchase and Reverse-Repurchase Transactions

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase continue to be recorded as assets in the Statement of Financial Position. The obligation to repurchase (Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase) is recognised as a liability. The difference between the sale and repurchase price in repurchase transactions and the purchase price and sale price in reverse-repurchase transactions represents an expense and income respectively and recognised in the Statement of Income.

Securities held under reverse-repurchase agreements are recorded as an asset in the Statement of Financial Position (Securities Purchased under Resale Agreements). Both repurchase and reverse-repurchase transactions are reported at amortized cost inclusive of any accrued income or expense.

5.11 Standing Deposit and Lending Facilities

With effect from 01 February 2014, Standing Deposit Facility (former Standing Repurchase (Repo) Facility) was converted in to a ‘clean deposit’ with no allocation of collateral. Hence, participating institutions invest their excess funds in the Standing Deposit Facility as a clean deposit on daily basis at standing deposit facility rate.

The procedures of Standing Lending Facility (Formerly Standing Reverse Repurchase (Reverse Repo) Facility) are identical to the Standing Reverse Repurchase Facility and both are recognized at amortized cost in the Statement of Financial Position.

5.12 CBSL Securities

The Bank issues CBSL Securities from time to time under its Monetary Policy operations to absorb excess liquidity in the market.

The securities issued are recorded as a liability. The difference between the issue price and the face value is recorded as an expense in the Statement of Income.

5.13 Sri Lanka Government Securities

Sri Lanka Government Securities consists of Treasury Bills and Bonds purchased from GOSL. Investments

in Sri Lanka Government Securities is recorded in the Statement of Financial Position at Fair value through Other Comprehensive Income.

5.14 Provisional Advances to Government

Advances to Government represents direct provisional advances made to GOSL under Section 89 of the Monetary Law Act No.58 of 1949 of Sri Lanka, as amended. These advances are subsequently measured at amortized cost.

5.15 Loans to Other Institutions

Loans granted to Other Institutions are recognized and carried at amortized cost.

5.16 Securities Borrowings and Securities Lending

Bank borrows Government Securities from time to time under its monetary policy operations from major institutional investors. The borrowed securities are used by the Bank for repurchase operations to absorb excess liquidity in the market.

The securities borrowings is an unconditional blanket guarantee from the Bank for return of securities, payment of agreed fee and on compensation at market rate (as per the market rates communicated to the primary market participants by the Public Debt Department of the Bank) in the events of any failure in delivery.

The market values of the securities borrowed and not used for the repurchase operations at a particular time are recorded as a contingent liability. The commission paid is expensed on accrual basis.

Transfer of securities to counterparties under lending transactions is only reflected on the Statement of Financial Position if the risks and rewards of ownership are also transferred.

5.17 Staff Loans

Bank employees are entitled to loan facilities under concessionary interest rates. These loans which were granted from 2008 onwards are fair valued as per IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” using discounted cash flows.

Discount rate - The rate compiled by the Economic Research Department of CBSL (ERD) based on the long term inflation target on USD – Commercial Interest Reference Rate (CIRR) plus 1 per cent added for the risk premium as agreed by the Audit Committee of the Bank is used as the discount rate and it varies with the period of the loans.

The difference between the present value of the staff loan as at the end of a year and beginning of the year have been amortized yearly to record the expense incurred by the Bank in providing these loans at concessionary rates and equivalent amount is recorded as other income to

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2019Part II - 21

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

record the income that would have been earned by the bank if these loans were granted at market rates.

Assumptions used for computation of fair valuation

• The date of staff loan granted is considered as 1

January.

• There were no amendments or early settlements.

5.18 Gold

Section 67 (1) of the Monetary Law Act which specifies the composition of the International Reserve indicates that gold may be held by the CBSL as part of this Reserve. Section 67(2), Monetary Board is required to endeavor to hold at least a nuclear reserve in gold or currencies freely convertible by the Central Bank, whether directly or indirectly, in to gold as per the MLA. As this gold is part of the International Reserve and not used as a commodity which is traded during the normal course of business, gold is fair valued and the gains or losses are transferred to the Statement of Income. Prior to appropriation of profits, the unrealised gains from gold are transferred to the relevant reserve account.

5.19 Currency Inventory

Inventories of the Bank include new currencies that are not yet issued to the circulation. Cost related to production and design of new currency notes and coins are initially recognized at cost. Cost of new currency notes and coins which are issued to the circulation is determined on a weighted average basis and at the time of issue it is charged to Statement of Income. Allowance is made for slow moving inventories.

5.20 Other Inventories

Other inventories are carried at lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis.

5.21 Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, Plant and Equipment excluding land & building are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment in value. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of such Property, Plant and Equipment when that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met.

Land and buildings are measured at revalued amount, being their fair value at the date of revaluation, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.

Except for the freehold land, depreciation is calculated on a straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives.

Class of AssetUseful Life

Buildings on Freehold LandsOver 50 Years

Buildings on Lease hold landsLower of 50 years or over the lease hold periodPlant & Plant Integrals 20 Years Furniture & Equipment10 Years Motor Vehicles5 Years Motor Vehicles acquired 2014 onwards10 YearsComputer Hardware 4 Years Others3 Years

The carrying values of Property, Plant and Equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

Policy for revaluation of Land & Building of the Bank is at least once in five years or at any shorter interval when a significant valuation adjustment becomes evident. Any revaluation surplus is credited to the Revaluation Reserve included in the equity section of the Statement of Financial Position, except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognized in Statement of Income, in which case the increase is recognized in Statement of Income. A revaluation deficit is recognized in Statement of Income, except that a deficit directly offsetting a previous surplus on the same asset is directly offset against the surplus in the Revaluation Reserve. Upon disposal, any revaluation surplus relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings.

An item of Property, Plant and Equipment is de-recognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the Statement of Income in the year the asset is de-recognized. The asset’s residual values, useful lives and methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, regularly.

Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost. These are expenses of a capital nature directly incurred in the construction of buildings, major plant and machinery and system development, awaiting capitalization.

5.22 Leases

Policy applicable from 1 January 2019

At inception of a contract, the Bank assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange of consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Bank uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16. This policy is

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2019Part II - 22

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

applied to contracts entered into (or changed) on or after 1 January 2019.

Bank acting as a lessee

The Bank recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjustment for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove any improvements made to the lands or office premises.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain re-measurements of the lease liability.

The liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicated in the lease or if that rate cannot be determined, the Bank’s incremental borrowing rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:

• Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;

• Variable lease payments that depend on an index or

a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;

• Amounts expected to be payable under a residual

value guarantee; and

• Exercise price under a purchase option that the Bank

is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Bank is reasonably certain not to terminate early.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Bank’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Bank changes its assessment of whether it will exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in Statement of Income if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

The Bank presents right-of-use assets in “Property Plant and Equipment” (Note 20) and lease liabilities in “Miscellaneous Liabilities and Accruals” (Note 33) in the Statement of Financial Position.

Policies applicable before 1 January 2019

For contracts entered before 1 January 2019, the Bank determined whether the arrangement contained a lease based on the assessment of whether:

• Fulfilment of the arrangement was dependent on the

use of a specific asset or assets; and • The arrangement has conveyed a right to use the

asset.

As a lessee

The Bank did not have any finance leases classified under IAS 17.

Assets held under other leases were classified as operating lease and were not recognised in the Bank’s Statement of Financial Position. Payments made over operating leases were recognised in Statement of Income on a straight-line basis over the term of lease. Lease incentives received were recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease.

5.23 Intangible Assets

Computer software not integral to computer hardware are shown as intangible assets and recognized at cost. Following initial recognition, these intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment. Subsequent expenditure on software assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.

Amortisation is recognised in Statement of Income on a straight-line basis over the useful life of 4 years, from the date that it is available for use since this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.

5.24 Other Assets

Other assets are carried at expected realisable values.

5.25 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets

The Bank assesses at each end of reporting period if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired, whether there is an indication that a non-financial asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the bank makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in Statement of Income.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2019Part II - 23

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

5.26 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Bank expects a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.

5.27 Currency in Circulation

Currency issued by the Bank represents a claim on the bank in favour of the holder. The liability for Currency in Circulation is recorded at face value in the Statement of Financial Position.

5.28 Pension and Other Post Employment Benefit

Plans

Pension and other Post Employment Benefit Plans operated by the bank are disclosed in Note 32.

5.29 Defined Benefit Plans

A defined benefit plan is a post employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. Bank operates defined benefit schemes for Pension, Widows’ and Orphans’ Pensions (W&OP), Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pensions (WR&OP), Retirement Gratuity and Post Employment Medical Benefits. The Bank and eligible beneficiaries make contributions, to separately administered funds in respect of the first three schemes.

The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. The Bank’s obligation in respect of defined benefit plan is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Any unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the valuation date on Government Bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the average remaining years of service. All principal actuarial assumptions disclosed in Note 32 are revised annually.

5.30 Defined Contribution Plans

Employees are eligible for Employees’ Provident Fund Contributions and Employees’ Trust Fund Contributions in line with respective statutes and regulations. The bank contributes 24% and 3% of employees’ gross emoluments to Employees’ Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fund respectively which are separately administered defined contribution plans.

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as expense in the Statement of Income as and when they are due.

5.31 Grants

Grants recognised at their fair value (where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions, if any, will be complied with) are shown under equity. When the grant relates to an expense item it is recognised in the Statement of Income over the periods necessary to match them to the expenses it is intended to compensate on a systematic basis. Where the grant relates to an asset, the fair value is credited to a deferred government grant account and is released to the Statement of Income over the expected useful life of the relevant asset on a systematic basis consistent with the depreciation policy of the related asset.

5.32 Contingent Liabilities and Commitments

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events or present obligations where the transfer of economic benefit is not probable or cannot be reliably measured. All guarantees of indebtedness, forward foreign exchange transactions and other commitments, which are not recognized in Statement of Financial Position, are shown under respective headings disclosed as Contingent Liabilities and Capital Commitments items. Where applicable, such amounts are measured at best estimates.

STATEMENT OF INCOME AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

5.33 Revenue and Expenses

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Bank and the revenue can be reliably measured. Expenses are recognised in the Statement of Income on the basis of a direct association between the cost incurred and the earning of specific items of income. All expenditure incurred in the running of the business and in maintaining the property, plant & equipment in a state of efficiency has been charged to income in arriving at the result for the year.

The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue and expenses are recognised:

5.33.1 Interest Income and Expenses

Interest income and expense are recognised in the Statement of Income for all interest bearing instruments on an accrual basis using the effective yield method based on the actual purchase price unless collectability is in doubt. Interest income includes coupons earned on fixed income investments and securities and accrued discount and premium on treasury bills and other discounted instruments. Interest income is suspended when loans become doubtful of collection. Such income is excluded from interest income until received.

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

5.33.2 Dividends

Dividend income is recognized when the Bank’s right to receive the payment is established.

5.33.3 Miscellaneous Income and Expenses

Miscellaneous income and expenses are recognised on an accrual basis.

Net gains and losses of a revenue nature on the disposal of Property, Plant & Equipment have been accounted for in the Statement of Income, having deducted from proceeds on disposal, the carrying amount of the assets and related selling expenses.

Gains and losses arising from incidental activities to the main revenue generating activities and those arising from a group of similar transactions which are not material, are aggregated, reported and presented on a net basis.

5.33.4 Personnel Expenses

Personnel Expenses include the full cost of all staff benefits. Salaries and related expenses due at year-end are included in other local payables.

5.33.5 Income Tax Expense

The income of the Bank is exempted from tax under section 118 of the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949 as amended and as per section 9 (1) of Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017. In terms of the Economic Service Charge (amendment) Act No. 07 of 2017, the Bank is liable for ESC commencing from 1 April 2017. However, unrealized gain on exchange rate and unrealized marked to market gain on foreign currency financial assets are exempted from ESC with effect from October 2018 as per the ESC (amendment) Act, No. 33 of 2018. Further, the Bank is exempted from Value Added Tax on supply of financial services as per Value Added Tax (Amendment) Act No.17 of 2013.

5.34 Events Occurring after the Reporting Date

All material subsequent events after the reporting date have been considered and where appropriate adjustments or disclosures have been made in the respective notes to the Financial Statements.

• IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts

7 NATURE AND EXTENT OF ACTIVITIES

7.1 Foreign Currency Activities

Foreign currency activities result mainly from the CBSL’s holdings of foreign currency assets under its foreign reserves management function. The foreign reserves management portfolio comprises foreign currency assets held for foreign exchange intervention purposes and other foreign currency assets held for trading purposes.

The foreign currency assets are held in various currencies. The majorities are denominated in United States Dollars, Australian Dollars, Euros, Sterling Pounds, Japanese Yen and New Zealand Dollar. The financial instruments held within these foreign currency portfolios consist mainly of sovereign securities, securities held under reverse-repurchase transactions or balances held with other central banks, commercial banks and custodial institutions.

The Bank also holds, from time-to-time, foreign currency assets and liabilities that arise from international market operations.

7.2 Local Currency Activities

Local currency activities arise as follows:

(i) Liquidity management operations: Liquidity management largely involves the CBSL offsetting the daily net flows to or from government or market by advancing funds to or withdrawing funds from the banking system. Most of this business is undertaken through daily open market operations.

(ii) Holding an investment portfolio comprising of Sri Lanka government securities to support the liability for currency in circulation. The bank’s policy is to hold these investments for monetary operations and not for trading.

7.3 Trust and Custodial Activities

Amounts administered by the CBSL under custodial and administration arrangements are not included in these Financial Statements, as they do not form part of elements of financial statements of the Bank.

11.2 The above derivatives consisting of Currency Swaps, Currency Options and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts were used for the purpose of managing market and liquidity risks in international reserves held by the Bank in line with the statutory objectives of maintenance of international reserves. In addition, the Bank entered into Swap transactions with Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs), Licensed Specialized Banks (LSBs) and Foreign Central Banks in order to maintain international stability of the Sri Lankan Rupee, to strengthen the financial system of the Country and to encourage those Banks to bring foreign funds.

11.3 Derivatives are financial contracts that derive their value in response to changes in interest rates, financial instruments prices, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit risk and indices.

11.4 A significant part of derivatives portfolio of the Bank consists of currency swaps entered into as a strategy to manage exchange rate risk and the short term liquidity requirements. In a currency swap, the Bank pays/ receives a specified amount of a currency on an agreed date in exchange of another currency at agreed rates.

11.5 From Foreign Exchange Forward contracts, the Bank gets the obligation to buy or sell specific amount of foreign currency on an agreed future date at an agreed rate.

11.6 The Bank’s exposure to derivative contracts is closely monitored as part of the overall risk management of the Bank to ensure expected benefits from such derivatives are crystalized to the Bank.

12.1 Holding of Special Drawing Rights

Holding of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) is potentially a claim on the freely usable currencies of IMF members in which holders of SDRs can exchange their SDRs for these currencies. The SDRs value as a reserve asset derives from the commitments of members to hold and accept SDRs, and to honor various obligations connected with the operation of the SDR system. The IMF ensures that the SDRs claim on freely usable currencies is being honored in two ways: by designating IMF members with a strong external position to purchase SDRs from members with weak external positions, and through the arrangement of voluntary exchanges between participating members in a managed market. The amount shown above represents the total holding of the Bank as at the respective reporting dates.

12.2 IMF Quota

The IMF Quotas (capital subscriptions) are the primary source of IMF resources received from its member countries. Each country’s quota is determined broadly on the basis of the relative economic size of the country. Upon joining the IMF, a country must pay 25 per cent of its quota in widely accepted foreign currencies or SDRs, and the remaining 75 per cent in its own currency. The IMF quota represents an asset of the Bank as it transacts with the IMF on its own account on behalf of the Government as per Articles of the IMF.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2019Part II - 27

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

The IMF, based on the General Quota Review Agreement, decided to increase the quotas of each of the IMF’s 189 members in January 2016. As a result, Sri Lanka’s IMF quota increased to SDR 578.80 Mn on 17 February 2016 from the previous quota amount of SDR 413.40 Mn.

The amounts payable in respect of the IMF Quota is shown under the heading Quota Liability in Note 24. A member’s quota determines that country’s financial and organizational relationship with IMF, including:

(i) Subscriptions: A member’s subscription to IMF resources is equal to its quota and determines the maximum amount of financial resources the member is obliged to provide to the IMF. A member must pay its subscription in full; up to 25 per cent must be paid in reserve assets specified by the IMF (SDRs or usable currencies), and the rest in the member’s own currency.

(ii) Voting power: The quota defines a member’s voting power in IMF decisions. IMF member’s votes are comprised of basic votes plus one additional vote for each SDR 100,000 of quota. The 2008 reform fixed the number of basic vote at 5.50 per cent of total votes.

(iii) Access to financing: The amount of financing a member can obtain from the IMF (access limits) is based on its quota. Under Stand-By and Extended Arrangements, for instance, a member can currently borrow up to 145 per cent of its quota annually and 435 per cent cumulatively. Access to finance may be higher in exceptional circumstances.

(iv) SDR allocations: Members’ shares of SDR allocations are established in proportion to their quotas.

12.3 Deposits with IMF – PRGF – HIPC Trust Deposit

The PRGF – HIPC (Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries) Trust Deposit was made under the agreement between the GOSL and the IMF on 21 April 2000 by transferring SDR 788,783 from Sri Lanka’s deposit in the post SCA-2 (Special Contingent Account) administered account with the IMF. This account was created under the guidance of the IMF by transferring the balance held in SCA-2 against Sri Lanka when it was decided to wind up SCA-2 by the IMF. The IMF requested the countries that had balances in the Post SCA-2 account to consider providing the balances in that account to the PRGF/HIPC Trust either as outright grant or as a means of providing a subsidy for PRGF/HIPC Loan. Accordingly GOSL agreed to transfer the funds from Post SCA –2 accounts to PRGF/HIPC Trust account, not as an outright grant, but as an interest free deposit until 2018. This was later extended until 2024.

countries that participate in the IMF’s SDR Department (an accounting unit within the IMF). The IMF created SDRs to supplement existing official reserve assets such as gold holdings, foreign exchange and reserve positions in the IMF. Under certain conditions, which are set in the Articles of Agreement signed on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka by the Bank, the IMF may allocate SDRs to members in proportion to their IMF quotas.

The Articles of Agreement also allow for cancellations of SDRs, but to date, this provision has not been used. Increases in Allocation of SDR represents increases in holding of SDR as described in Note 12. Members of IMF are obligated to pay to the IMF an amount equal to its net cumulative allocation and any other amounts that may be due and payable because of its participation in the Special Drawing Rights Department at the point of termination or liquidation of IMF’s SDR Department.

Orphans and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme is open for employees of the Bank who joined after 1 January 1998. Eligible Employees under the Widows’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme (old) and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme (old) plans who were recruited before 1 August 1994 contribute 5% of the monthly basic salary & employees who were recruited on or after 01 August 1994 contribute 10% of the monthly basic salary whereas the eligible employees under the new Widows’ and Orphans’ and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme contribute 5.5% of the monthly basic salary.

The Bank also provides gratuity benefits to employees who have completed five years of service in the Bank and who are not eligible for a monthly pension payment under the Employees’ Retirement Pension Schemes. In order to meet this liability, a provision is carried forward in the Statement of Financial Position, equivalent to the liability calculated using the actuarial valuation.

The Bank has a Post-Employment Medical Benefit Scheme which provides reimbursement of certain medical expenses incurred by retired employees on account of themselves, their spouses, their parents and by widows/widowers.

The Bank employed an Independent Actuary M/s K. A. Pandit, Consultant & Actuary (Mumbai) to re-assess the defined benefit obligations and the current service costs attributable to the Employees’ Retirement Pension Schemes, Widows’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme, Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme, new Widows’ and Orphans’ and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension scheme, Gratuity Scheme and Medical Benefit Scheme during the year.

Funds of the Employee Retirement Pension Schemes, Widows’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme, Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme are managed separately and separate books are maintained. However, Gratuity Scheme and Medical Benefit Scheme are not separated from the books of accounts of the Bank. Further, investments and investment income are recorded separately for these funds in the Bank books and the income earned from the investments are transferred back to these funds and reinvested without being distributed.

The total present value of all benefit obligations of Rs. 52,461.11 Mn (2018 – Rs. 48,245.66 Mn) exceeds the total fair value of plan assets of Rs. 43,931.50 Mn (2018 – Rs. 38,884.03 Mn) at the end of the reporting period resulting in a deficit of Rs. 8,529.61 Mn (2018 – deficit of Rs. 9,361.63 Mn).

The balance shown under Pension and Other Post Employment Benefit Plans in Statement of Financial Position differs from the net liability as per the actuary due to the following reasons:

a) The net asset position of the and Widowers’ and Orphans’ Pension Scheme is not reflected in the financial statements due to remote possibility of distributing any residual balance of the fund to the Bank.

b) For both gratuity and medical benefit schemes, the financial statements represent the gross liability position and not the net liability as per actuary, since the Bank does not keep relevant assets in a separate fund (internally maintained).

48. RISK MANAGEMENT

In pursuing Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s (CBSL) policy objectives, it faces various risks, both financial and non-financial in nature. Since the materialization of any of these risks could have a severe impact on the financial position and the reputation of CBSL, a properly designed risk management framework is vital for CBSL. The recognition the strategic importance of an integrated approach to risk management, led to the creation of a separate Risk Management Department (RMD) at CBSL in 2015 to overcome the conventional management of viewing risk in silos. Accordingly, risk management was

recognized as a key strategic priority of the CBSL for 2018-2020 and the Bank is in the process of implementing an Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) Framework for CBSL. This framework is intended to promote a culture of informed risk-taking at all levels of the Bank.

The Risk Governance Framework which was approved by the Monetary Board in January 2018 comprises both a Risk Governance Structure and a Risk Management Structure covering financial and non-financial risks confronted by the Bank. The Risk Governance Structure consists of the Monetary Board (MB), and two Board sub-committees, the Board Risk Oversight Committee (BROC)

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2019Part II - 45

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri LankaPart II

and the Monetary Board Advisory Audit Committee (MBAAC). The MB holds the ultimate responsibility for the overall risk management function of the Bank and sets the “Tone at the Top”. Further, MB is responsible for setting the Risk Appetite and Risk Tolerance level for CBSL and approving the risk management/compliance framework.

The BROC was set up in August 2018 and is chaired by Mr. Chrishantha Perera, independent member of the Monetary Board and comprises two independent external experts (Mr. Priyan Fernando, Chairman Brandix Lanka Ltd. and Senior Advisor, Boston Consulting Group was appointed from 5 October 2018 onwards and Mr. Naomal Goonewardena, Partner, Nithya Partners was appointed from 1 March 2019 onwards). The BROC oversees CBSL’s overall Risk Management and Compliance Functions via a formal delegation from the MB, and is responsible for laying the broad strategy and policies for the Bank’s risk management and compliance functions. The BROC also assists the MB to ensure a dedicated focus on risk management and compliance at the Bank.

The Risk Management Structure that has been put in place follows the Three Lines of Defense model. In the first line of defense, operational departments are expected to identify, assess, control, and mitigate risks and implement internal policies and procedures to ensure that activities carried out are consistent with the Bank’s goals and objectives. The Risk Management Department assists in monitoring the implementation of effective risk management practices by operational management and independently reports risks related issues to the Risk Governance Structure creating a link between the Risk Management and Risk Governance Structures. The third line of defense, Internal Audit provides assurance on the effectiveness of governance, risk management, and internal controls, including the manner in which the first and second lines of defense achieve risk management and control objectives. Each of these three ‘lines’ plays a distinct role within the Bank’s risk governance framework.

In addition to facilitating non-financial risk management of all the departments under the three lines of defense model, RMD is also responsible for the financial risk management of the fund management activities of the International Reserves (IR), and the Internal Investment Funds (IIF) of CBSL, as well as the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) which is carried out as an agency function for the Government. RMD revised the Investment Policy Statements (IPS) and Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) for all three fund management activities during the year. RMD also independently monitored market and credit risks pertaining to these fund management activities and reported risks emanating from them to the respective Investment Oversight Committees (IOCs) on monthly basis and to the BROC on quarterly basis.

In line with the new framework, RMD has developed a Risk Management Policy Statement (RMPS) for the CBSL, setting out the policies for the implementation of risk management across CBSL. In this process, CBSL follows accepted standards and guidelines for managing risks, while assigning risk ownership and management among different stakeholders with clear accountability.

An annual survey was conducted among the corporate management of CBSL to determine the current top bank-wide operational risks impacting the CBSL. The survey results will be used to revise the Operational Risk Taxonomy for CBSL, which would help prioritize key operational risk categories that could impact the institution and requiring the attention of the Management.

To promote a risk culture within the bank, RMD conducted numerous risk awareness sessions for CBSL staff throughout the year at various fora, with the involvement of RMD staff and external resource personnel.

With a view to strengthen the operational risk management function, RMD worked closely with the World Bank’s Operational Risk Team where the existing risk governance structure and the framework for managing operational risks were reviewed, risk taxonomy was finalized and rating scales and specific steps related to identification, assessment, monitoring and reporting of non-financial risks were established. The World Bank team conducted an operational risk assessment over two selected pilot areas of the CBSL and delivered training on operational risk management to all key staff.

RMD worked with departments to facilitate the development of Risk Registers and to refine these Risk Registers in a phased-out manner using an excel based risk register format. Once this process is completed the Management will be able to make more informed, risk conscious decisions on a prioritized basis on departmental activities.

RMD with the assistance of ITD deployed an automated Incident Reporting System on 1 October 2019, which is accessible to staff at all levels of the CBSL. This system is expected to encourage reporting of incidents and facilitate the development of a central repository of incidents while tracking progress on the implementation of corrective actions, identifying possible trends and areas of vulnerabilities and improving risk reduction measures.

With respect to financial risk management, RMD will further strengthen the risk management framework through the annual process of reviewing the investment policies and guidelines for each of the funds managed by CBSL. RMD is in the process of improving the credit risk management framework of the fund management activities of CBSL, covering CBSL’s counterparties, issuers and custodians. In the meantime, RMD would continue to monitor credit and market risks pertaining to investments on an ongoing basis to ensure they are within the stipulated limits specified by the Monetary Board approved Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA), IPS and IG and highlight risks to the management at all times.

48.2 Interest Rate Risk

(a) Foreign Currency Interest Rate Sensitivity

Interest rate risk is the risk of loss arising from the changes in interest rates.

The interest rate sensitivity of the Fixed Income Securities portfolio, except the investment in Reserve Advisory Management Program (RAMP), is measured by the potential gain or loss that could incur due to a change in interest rate by 10 basis points. The interest rate sensitivity of the fixed income securities portfolio held under RAMP is meaured by the potential gain or loss that could incur due to a change in interest by 1 basis point. Sensitivity of the risk exposure of the segmented Fixed Income Securities Portfolio is given below:

Portfolio SegmentPotential Loss (USD Mn)20192018Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income8.147.86RAMP0.030.03

RMD manages the interest rate risk of the foreign assets portfolio by employing the following strategies:i) While the interest rate sensitivity measures the effect of a change in interest rates on the foreign assets portfolio, the Bank uses Modified Duration (MD) as a measurement of interest rate risk which considers interest rates as well as the duration of an investment. The MD measures the change in price of a security for a 1% change in the interest rates (yield). A higher MD indicates a higher risk. Hence, the Bank sets an appropriate MD from time to time considering the developments in the financial markets, portfolio characteristics and the risk appetite of the bond portfolio. The MDs of the foreign assets portfolio are tabulated below:

Modified Duration

Investment SegmentModified Duration20192018Capital Market (Fixed Income Securities)2.032.08RAMP1.381.41

ii) Since the MD does not account for large changes in prices, another measure used for management of interest rate risk of the foreign reserves portfolio is convexity. Convexity measures the extent of deviation in bond price-yield curve from a straight line representing duration. It allows improving the duration approximation for bond price changes. Convexity is a change in Duration for a change in yield. It measures the predictive error of Modified Duration. In other words, it is the second derivative of a security’s price with respect to its yield.

RAMP0.040.04

iii) Value at Risk (VaR)

VaR summarizes in a single number the downside risk of the portfolio, under normal market conditions, from financial market movements. Therefore, VaR is the maximum loss over a target horizon such that there is a low, pre-specified probability that the actual loss will be larger. VaR gives a number, in terms of money, which can be aggregated across risks and positions. The Bank uses Monte Carlo method to calculate VaR number for 10 days period at 99% confidence interval for its fixed income securities portfolio except for the investment in RAMP. The VaR of the fixed income securities portfolio held under RAMP is measured using the Monte Carlo method for one month period at 99 % confidence interval.

Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income25.3019.94

RAMP1.170.78

iv) Trading & Open Position Limits

Bank assigns specific dealer limits on intra-day and overnight position limits for individual dealers by way of “Dealing Authority “.

Interest rate risk measures related to the investments in the Reserve Advisory Management Program (RAMP) is reported to the Foreign Reserve Management Committee on a regular basis.

(b) Local Currency Interest Rate Sensitivity

The Government Securities portfolio is recorded in the Statement of Financial Position of the Bank at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income as per the Business Model assessment under IFRS 9. This portfolio is not an investment portfolio, as the Bank does not purchase Government Securities with the intention of earning an interest income. The Bank purchases or sells Government Securities to inject rupee liquidity into the domestic market or to absorb liquidity from the market in the course of carrying out its monetary policy operations in relation to one of its core objectives, maintaining economic and price stability. Hence, the volume of Government Securities in the Bank’s portfolio is determined by its monetary policy operations. In addition, the basic interest rates in the rupee market, the Repo rate and the Reverse Repo rate are policy rates determined by the Bank in the course of implementing its monetary policy. Moreover, the Bank’s actions in injecting rupee liquidity or absorbing liquidity from the market have a significant impact on general rupee market interest rates. Thus, changes in the interest income earned from the Government Securities portfolio, which arise from changes in the volume of the Bank’s Government Securities portfolio, as well as changes in interest rates, are primarily a consequence of the Bank’s monetary policy actions, rather than due to investment decisions. Therefore, the Bank does not consider interest rate sensitivities arising from local currency assets.

48.3 Foreign Currency Risk

Foreign currency activities result mainly from the Bank’s holding of foreign currency assets under its foreign reserve management function. Volatility of the foreign exchange markets may expose the Bank to exchange risk. The Monetary Board and International Reserves Investment and Oversight Committee (IRIOC) have set percentage holdings of different currencies in its

International Reserves. In deciding on the currency allocation, public debt repayment requirements are given due consideration. Accordingly, the Bank holds most major currencies such as US Dollars, Sterling Pounds, Japanese Yen, Euro, Australian Dollars and New Zealand Dollars. Compliance with limits established for foreign currency positions are monitored.

48.5 Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the difficulty that an entity will encounter in raising funds at short notice to meet commitments associated with financial instruments. Liquidity risk is also the risk that an entity will have to sell a financial asset quickly at much less than its fair value.

a) Liquidity is a key consideration in determining the composition of the Bank’s foreign currency assets. This reflects the potential requirement to liquidate foreign reserves for intervention purposes and to settle other commitments such as public debt and IMF Loan repayments when the need arises. The Bank has adopted the following measures aimed at ensuring quick access to funds:

• Liquid asset ratios based on the liquidity characteristics of securities held

• Limits on maximum proportion of reserves that may be held in one currency and with one counterparty

b) In order to reduce the level of liquidity risk arising out of the local currency activities, particularly open market operations, the Bank uses highly liquid marketable instruments such as Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds as collateral. It manages the daily liquidity position of the banking system by way of infusing into or withdrawal from the system, using instruments such as repo/reverse repo, CBSL securities and USD/LKR Swaps.

51. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES

51.1 Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities

‘Fair Value’ is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Bank has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk

The determination of fair value for financial assets and liabilities for which there is no observable market price requires the use of valuation techniques as described in accounting policy Note 5.2. For financial instruments that trade infrequently and have little price transparency, fair value is less objective, and requires varying degrees

of judgement depending on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty of market factors, pricing assumptions and other risks affecting the specific instrument. The fair value hierarchy of financial instruments is given below:

Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

Level 2: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

Level 3: Fair value measurements using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

Land & Buildings

Valuation MethodLand is valued using market approach with direct comparison method, whereby assets are compared to recent sales with no added or nominal added improvement value, making adjustments for points of difference to derive the fair value.

Depreciated Current Replacement Cost (DRC) method is used in valuing all the buildings except Central Point, White Aways and Lloyds Building, considering that the assets controlled by the public sector entities that provide service to the community are not traded on an open liquid market.

Income approach is used to value the other buildings which values the property based on estimated future income, profits or cash flow that are converted (discounted) to a single current amount.

Under the Market Approach, estimated fair value would get increased/(decreased) if;

Price per perch would get higher/(lower)Price per square foot would get higher/(lower)Depreciation rate for building would get lower/(higher)

Under Income Approach, estimated fair value would get increased/(decreased) if;

Gross annual rentals would get higher/(lower)Years purchase would get higher/(lower)

Derivatives

Derivative valuation models use forward prices (calculated by extrapolating the forward points available in the market) and discount rates calculated based on zero coupon yield curves of the respective currencies as of the valuation date. If the instrument that is valued contains a margin, adjustments are made to the forward prices and/or the interest rates to represent the impact of the margin rate.

- Securites Sold under Agreements to Repurchase- Securities Lending- Securities Pledged

55.1 Transferred Financial Assets that are not Derecognized in their Entirety

a. Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase transactions are performed as part of the Monetary Policy operations of the Bank and continues to be recognized in their entirety under “Sri Lanka Government Securities” in the Statement of Financial Position because it retains substatially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. The cash consideration to be

paid and the interest accured there on are recognized under Securities sold under repurchase agreements in the local financial liabilities of the Statement of Financial Position.

b. Securities Lending

Securities lending describes the established market practice by which, for a fee, securities are transferred temporarily from one party (the lender, i.e. CBSL), to another (the borrower); the borrower is obliged to return them either on demand or at the end of any agreed term. Currently a selected Clearing House (CH) functions as the custodian for the supranational bonds and bonds issued by different issuers. CBSL has signed an agreement which enable CH to lend at their wish depending on the demand for those bonds. Since the lending does not involve CBSL and CH lends them directly to the borrowers, the process is called auto bond lending. At the end of each month, custodian will send fee income for auto bond lending, if any for the bonds which they lent under auto bond lending programme. The Bank continues to recognize the securities in their entirety in the Statement of Financial Position because it retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. These securities are presented in the Statement of Financial Position as “Securities at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income”.

c. Securities Pledged

In order to facilitate the securities settlement process, securities amounting to AUD 35.0 Mn were pledged by the Bank to Euroclear and obtained a credit facility of USD 30.0 Mn. The pledged securities are held in a seperate account at Euroclear.

2. BANK SUPERVISION

Bank Supervision Department (BSD) was established under Section 28 of the Monetary Law Act (MLA) for the purposes of continuous supervision and periodic examination of licensed banks in Sri Lanka. In addition, regulation and supervision of licensed banks are governed by the provisions of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988, as amended.

BSD carries out its functions to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system in Sri Lanka and to safeguard the interests of the depositors and other creditors of licensed banks. The main functions of BSD include licensing of commercial banks and specialised banks in Sri Lanka (hereinafter referred to as licensed banks); formulating and issuing of prudential regulations; conducting continuous supervision and periodic statutory examinations of licensed banks; approving the fitness and propriety of Directors, Chief Executive Officers and Key Management Personnel (KMPs) of licensed banks; granting regulatory approvals; taking regulatory actions where necessary with the approval of the Monetary Board and engaging in awareness and capacity building of the banking sector.

As at the end of 2019, the banking sector comprised 26 licensed commercial banks (LCBs) and 6 licensed specialised banks (LSBs) operating under the regulatory and supervisory purview of BSD. In addition, 3 Representative Offices (ROs) of foreign banks were in operation in Sri Lanka. The list of licensed banks and ROs is provided in Annex II-I.

A summary of the main functions and activities performed by BSD during 2019 is given below:

2.1 Issuance of Prudential Regulations

Prudential regulations issued to licensed banks during the year are provided in Part III of this Report. A summary of the major prudential regulations is as follows.

(a) Framework for Employment of Expatriate Officers

A Circular was issued to licensed banks informing them of the framework for the employment of expatriate officers in licensed banks in Sri Lanka, revoking the previous Circular issued in this regard. Banks were required to give priority to local officers before considering to employ expatriate staff and to establish succession planning to identify local talent and train such staff to take up responsibilities held by expatriate officers within a reasonable period.

(b) Publication of Annual and Quarterly Financial Statements and Other Disclosures

A Circular on the “Publication of Annual and Quarterly Financial Statements and Other Disclosures by Licensed Banks” was issued specifying a new set of formats to publish financial statements in line with the new Sri Lanka Accounting Standard - SLFRS 9, replacing the existing formats.

(c) Non-Interest Based Incentive Schemes for Interest Bearing Savings and Time Deposits of Licensed Banks

Considering the undue competition created among licensed banks due to the non-interest based incentive schemes for mobilising interest-bearing deposits, and its potential impact on the monetary policy implemented by the Central Bank, licensed banks were required to refrain from conducting lottery schemes/raffle draws and gift schemes that result in a disadvantageous situation for the customers, where features of a financial product/service are distorted.

(d) Measures to Curtail Imports of Motor Vehicles and Non-essential Consumer Goods

Licensed banks were informed of the removal of restrictions on opening Letters of Credit (LCs) for importation of motor vehicles under permits on concessionary terms.

(e) Maximum Interest Rates on Sri Lankan Rupee Deposits of Licensed Banks

Considering the high real interest rates on deposits and lending products that prevailed in the economy and the need to strengthen and expedite monetary policy transmission through the financial system, a Monetary Law Act Order was issued to licensed banks imposing maximum interest rates applicable on rupee denominated deposits. This measure was adopted with a view to reducing the cost of funds of licensed banks and thereby reducing the interest rates on lending rates to enhance credit flows to the real economy. Accordingly, licensed banks were informed that savings and other deposits of a tenure of less than three months or maturity unspecified should be based on Standing Deposit Facility Rate and interest rates of term deposits of three months or more should be based on 364 day T-bill rates. This Order was subsequently revoked in September, with the issuance of the Monetary Law Act Order on enhancing efficiency of the transmission of recent policy decisions to rupee denominated market lending rates.

A Monetary Law Act Order was issued to licensed banks on enhancing efficiency of the transmission of recent policy decisions to rupee denominated market lending rates. Accordingly, licensed banks were required to reduce interest rates of rupee denominated loans and advances by a certain number of basis points by the given target dates with a view to enhancing credit flows to the economy in order to revive the subdued economic activity. In addition, interest rate caps were introduced for credit card advances, pre-arranged temporary overdrafts and penal interest rates.

(f) Supplement to the Circular on Adoption of Sri Lanka Accounting Standard – SLFRS 9: Financial Instruments in Licensed Banks

A Circular was issued to licensed banks informing several interim measures in respect of adopting SLFRS 9 during the transitional period of 01.01.2019 to 30.06.2019 in order to address high market interest rates and issues faced by Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).

(g) SMEs Referred under Basel III Regulatory Framework on Capital and Liquidity Standards

Banking Act Directions were issued to licensed banks informing regulatory requirements with respect to identification of SMEs for the purpose of capital and liquidity standards under the Basel III framework.

(h) Concessions Granted to Tourism Industry

Considering the adverse impact on the tourism industry due to the Easter Sunday terrorist attacks, a Circular was issued to licensed banks requesting to grant concessions to individuals and entities in the tourism industry who wish to avail of such concessions. Such concessions were aimed at providing an opportunity to individuals and entities in the tourism industry to revive their businesses and thereby to reduce the non-performing loans of the licensed banks. Accordingly, it was informed that licensed banks may grant a moratorium on a case-by-case basis to individuals and entities who are registered with the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) or any other authority/agency under SLTDA to provide services in the tourism sector. Licensed banks were instructed to convert the capital and interest falling due during the moratorium period into a term loan with a concessionary interest rate, which shall be recovered from July 2020 onwards. Subsequently, a series of explanatory notes was issued in this connection interpreting the applicability of concessions and granting of moratorium, recognition of registered entities and individuals, and the accounting treatment.

(i) Loan to Value (LTV) Ratios for Credit Facilities Granted in Respect of Motor Vehicles

Banking Act Directions were issued to licensed banks informing the revised LTV ratios applicable for credit facilities granted in respect of motor vehicles, and unregistered non-electric motor cars purchased under the mini taxi concessionary loan scheme under the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme.

(j) Harmonising Banking Act Regulations on Capital Adequacy and Leverage Ratio in line with Sri Lanka Accounting Standard – SLFRS 9

Considering the implications of adopting SLFRS 9 and to ensure the consistency of capital and risk weighted assets computation under Basel III, BSD issued explanatory notes to licensed banks in order to align the computation of

Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and Leverage Ratio under Basel III with SLFRS 9.

(k) Market Conduct and Treasury Operations of Licensed Banks in Sri Lanka

Banking Act Directions were issued to licensed banks on “Market Conduct and Treasury Operations of Licensed Banks” including market conduct and ethical practices, confidentiality requirements, procedure for the recording of deal conversations, risk management principles, professionalism and knowledge level and sanctions on non-compliance with Directions. The Directions were aimed at further improving the market conduct and practices for treasury operations to strengthen market risk management systems in licensed banks, thereby strengthening soundness and stability of the financial system. Previous Directions and Circulars issued in this regard were revoked.

(l) List of Qualified Auditors to Audit the Accounts of Licensed Banks

A Circular was issued announcing the new list of qualified auditors to audit accounts of licensed banks, from financial years commencing 01 January 2021. The existing eligibility criteria for the selection of such auditors were strengthened in line with the changes in the banking sector landscape, changes in accounting and auditing professions, introduction of Basel III requirements and SLFRS 9.

(m) Amendments to the Regulatory Framework on Valuation of Immovable Properties of Licensed Banks

Banking Act Directions were issued amending the eligibility criteria for valuers under the regulatory framework on valuation of immovable properties of licensed banks.

(n) Assessment of Fitness and Propriety of Chief Executive Officers and Officers Performing Executive Functions in Licensed Banks

Banking Act Determinations were issued designating certain positions as officers performing executive functions in licensed banks and requiring such officers and chief executive officers of licensed banks to furnish information in a format prescribed by the Central Bank to assess/re-assess their fitness and propriety prior to appointment/periodically for the purpose of obtaining approval of the Director Bank Supervision. Previous determinations and Circulars issued in this regard were revoked.

(o) Assessment of Fitness and Propriety of Directors of Licensed Banks

Banking Act Directions were issued on assessment of fitness and propriety of Directors of licensed banks, including the information to be submitted by the persons proposed to be appointed, elected or nominated as Directors of licensed

Part II

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 73

banks and for the annual reassessment of such Directors for the purpose of obtaining approval of the Director of Bank Supervision. Previous Circulars issued in this regard were revoked.

(p) Amendments to the Banking Act Directions on Corporate Governance

An amendment to the Banking Act Directions on Corporate Governance for Licensed Banks was issued by introducing a cooling off period of 6 months for appointment of a Director or a Chief Executive Officer of a licensed bank operating in Sri Lanka as a Director or a Chief Executive Officer of another licensed bank operating in Sri Lanka.

(q) Framework for Dealing with Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs)

A framework was issued to identify banks whose failure has a greater impact on the financial system due to the size, interconnectedness, lack of substitutability and complexity as D-SIBs, amending the previous criteria where D-SIBs were defined as banks with assets of Rs. 500 billion or above. Such banks were required to maintain additional Higher Loss Absorbency (HLA) requirements as capital surcharge. In this regard, Banking Act Directions were issued determining four licensed banks as D-SIBs and specifying their respective HLA requirements. Further, Banking Act Directions on Capital Requirements under Basel III were amended to incorporate additional HLA requirements in the form of Common Equity Tier 1 for D-SIBs.

2.2 Drafting the New Banking Act

Considering the increasingly competitive, fast evolving and complex nature of the banking sector in Sri Lanka, which approximately accounts for 62 per cent of the financial sector, the importance of strengthening the existing regulatory framework of licensed banks has been highlighted in the recent past. Accordingly, BSD initiated drafting a new Banking Act and the key concepts proposed in the new Banking Act were presented to the Monetary Board in 2019.

Some of the key concepts proposed to be incorporated in the new Banking Act include the introduction of a single type of banking licence, adoption of proportionality in banking regulations, introduction of Financial Holding Company Structure for subsidiaries and associates of licensed banks, streamlining equity investments by banks, subsidiarisation of foreign bank branches in Sri Lanka, consumer protection, strengthening governance and suitably extending the provisions of the new Banking Act to banks to be established in the Colombo International Financial Centre (CIFC).

A Consultation Paper comprising the above concepts was issued to the banking sector and other industry stakeholders to provide comments and observations and the Central

Bank expects to complete enacting the new Act by early 2021.

2.3 Approvals Granted by the Monetary Board and the Director of Bank Supervision

(a) Mergers, Acquisitions and Closures of Licensed Banks

During the year, the Central Bank facilitated the consolidation process of small state-owned licensed banks. Accordingly, the Central Bank provided necessary guidance and granted the regulatory approvals in a timely manner to successfully complete the acquisition and absorption of the banking business of Lankaputhra Development Bank Ltd. (LDB) by Pradeshiya Sanwardhana Bank. Upon completing the consolidation process, the banking license issued to LDB was cancelled. Further, the acquisition of Sri Lanka Savings Bank Ltd. by National Savings Bank was also facilitated by the Central Bank. Further, the Monetary Board permitted Axis Bank Limited and ICICI Bank Limited to commence their closedown procedures as per requests from their respective Head Offices.

(b) Branches and Other Banking Outlets of Licensed Banks

During the year, 1,557 requests were processed and 1,519 approvals were granted, while 38 requests were deferred/declined on prudential grounds (Table II-1).

2.4 Regulatory Actions

During 2019, licensed banks were required to initiate corrective measures with regard to non-compliances with the Banking Act and Directions issued thereunder on 24 instances.

2.5 Conduct of Continuous Supervision

(a) Continuous supervision is an on-going monitoring mechanism on the affairs of individual banks, which serves as an early warning system to ascertain the operational efficiency and long-term sustainability of the entire banking sector, and it enables the implementation of corrective measures, where necessary, to ensure safety of depositors’ funds.

(b) Continuous supervision was conducted based on periodic financial information submitted by banks through the web based FinNet System. Approximately 70 statutory returns are submitted weekly/monthly/quarterly/annually by each bank through the FinNet system covering financial and prudential information, while 18 returns are submitted manually. The initiative to revamp the database maintained in BSD, in consultation with the Information Technology Department (ITD), continued in 2019 in order to facilitate better report generation. Further, 8 new FinNet returns were developed while 2 existing returns were amended.

(c) In the process of continuous monitoring and supervision of banks, special reports were submitted on the movement of interest rates with respect to deposit and lending rate caps imposed on banks and exposures of the banking industry to the condominium and construction sector. In addition, banking industry aggregate data were shared with other departments of the Central Bank and external government institutions to facilitate in making policy decisions and preparation of reports. Further, 15 presentations on the performance of the banking industry were also prepared for various forums, and the Monetary Board was apprised of the banking sector performance on quarterly basis.

(d) During 2019, approximately 661 customer complaints/requests, including requests under the Right to Information Act, were handled. These complaints were primarily related to lending interest rates, rescheduled loans, credit cards, pawning operations, unauthorised withdrawal of funds and seeking reduction in charges and fees on Automated Teller Machines.

(e) BSD facilitated collection and submission of information on reimbursement of interest cost in relation to the special interest scheme for senior citizens, to the Ministry of Finance, on a quarterly basis.

(f) BSD continued to monitor the progress of addressing supervisory concerns identified during statutory examinations of banks within specified time targets on a quarterly basis. In addition, 17 meetings were held with licensed banks to discuss regulatory concerns identified during continuous supervision.

2.6 Conduct of Periodic Examinations

(a) During 2019, BSD conducted 27 statutory examinations including one thematic review on credit management of selected 14 banks and completed 05 examinations, which continued from the previous year. Statutory examinations of 26 licensed banks were commenced and completed in 2019 through formal discussions with the management of the respective banks. Submission of reports to the Monetary Board was completed for 13 statutory examinations, while 13 examinations were in the process of completion. Major concerns raised at certain examinations included deteriorated asset quality in terms of increased impaired loans, lapses identified in computation of impairment charges resulting in inaccurate percentages of impaired loans, low capitalisation and efficiency, lapses in corporate governance and management, deficiencies in the management of technology risk and liquidity risk, and concerns over treasury operations. In addition, several examinations with limited scope were conducted on areas such as rescheduled credit facilities, adherence to the directions on corporate governance, customer complaints, liquidity risk, branch fraud, human resource management and customer account transaction verification.

(b) Further, BSD developed a supervisory rating model for licensed banks viz, the Bank Sustainability Rating Indicator (BSRI), which was approved by the Monetary Board, to facilitate the risk based supervision framework of licensed banks and to enable early intervention and prompt corrective action through identification of potential risks arising from emerging developments and strategic changes of licensed banks. During 2019, the proposed BSRI model was further improved by reviewing all parameters and developing a comprehensive supervisory guidance framework to uphold the consistent application of the BSRI framework across banks.

2.7 Awareness and Capacity Building of the Banking Sector

(a) Capacity Building

BSD conducted knowledge sharing sessions for Key Management Personnel of banks including, Compliance Officers, Chief Information Officers and Chief Risk Officers on relevant topics. Further, BSD officers served as resource persons for training programmes and panel discussions at various forums. BSD officers also continued to serve as committee members in various committees including Working Group on Regulatory and Risk of Colombo Financial City, Working Committee on Prudential Directions and Regulations of the Government Securities Market and Operations of Primary Dealers, Working Committee on Blockchain Technology, Steering Committee of the Financial Sector Computer Security Incident Response Team (FINCSIRT), Taskforce to Study Virtual Currency Schemes in Sri Lanka, Committee to Promote Digitalisation of Payments to Enhance Financial Inclusion, Steering Committee on Sustainable Finance and National Payments Council Roadmap Committee.

Capacity building of the staff of BSD was continued in 2019 and officers of BSD participated in local and foreign training programmes, including supervisory colleges, in the areas of risk based supervision, advanced stress testing, data analysis, corporate governance and ethics, consolidated supervision and risk integration, financial reporting standards and sustainable finance.

(b) Meetings with Banks and other Stakeholders

BSD continued to function as the secretariat for the monthly meetings of bank CEOs chaired by the Governor, aimed at maintaining a continuous dialogue between the Central Bank and the banking sector on matters relating to the developments in the Sri Lankan economy, the banking sector, and the regulatory and supervisory framework. Additionally, a meeting of bank chairpersons was held to apprise them of the banking sector performance, developments in the economy and local and global regulatory frameworks.

Regular meetings were conducted with the senior management and Board appointed committees of

concerned licensed banks to discuss bank specific matters, to ensure proper oversight and timely implementation of corrective action, and to ensure the sustainability of the banking sector. Further, BSD facilitated banks in the adoption of new Sri Lanka Financial Reporting Standards by organising meetings with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka.

BSD organised quarterly meetings of the Financial Sector Oversight Council (FSOC), which comprises heads of core financial sector regulators, to facilitate cooperation among member institutions to ensure efficiency, soundness and safety of the financial system.

3. CENTRE FOR BANKING STUDIES

Centre for Banking Studies (CBS), the training arm of the Central Bank, has been a strategic partner in providing life-long learning opportunities for financial sector professionals in Sri Lanka and other central bankers in the region. CBS has helped financial sector institutions and corporates to develop their human capital to create competitive advantage through the people.

CBS demonstrates its commitment through organising and conducting numerous training programmes, workshops and seminars to equip financial sector professionals with required knowledge, skills and exposure. Accordingly, CBS focuses on designing, co-ordinating and conducting training programmes, seminars and workshops to cater to the evolving needs of the financial sector professionals, while ensuring high quality training with advanced training facilities. Further, special emphasis was given to provide training to the staff of the Central Bank keeping in line with the strategic objective of the “capacity building and support” cluster.

CBS offered training programmes in 2019, covering the areas of banking and finance, risk management and compliance, treasury operations, accounting and financial management, law and regulations, research and data analysis, economics, human resources and general management, rural sector development and microfinance, and information technology. In conducting training programmes on these various areas, CBS obtained the services of high caliber resource persons from the Central Bank and external experts including foreign experts in the financial sector, policy and regulatory areas with required academic excellence and international exposure.

CBS successfully conducted 144 programmes during the year which consisted of 50 calendar programmes, 62 special programmes, 20 educational programmes and 12 public lectures in 2019. Further, 26 capacity building programmes were conducted to enhance the competencies of the Central Bank staff for which 1,052 staff members participated. Capacity building programmes included the programmes conducted in collaboration with the SEACEN Research and Training Centre, Reserve Bank Staff College of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and Deutsche Bundesbank, Germany. Further, CBS conducted 17 tailor-made training programmes during the year at the request of local commercial banks, specialised banks, foreign central banks and commercial banks. In view of promoting economic education and financial inclusion, CBS organised 8 public seminars on various topics at CBS and 4 public seminars at regional level. A total of 8,378 local participants and 131 foreign participants from Bangladesh, Maldives, Nepal, Malaysia, Oman and Sudan attended CBS programmes in 2019.

In addition, CBS continued to co-ordinate the educational television series, “Thakshilawa” and “Ariwootroo”, telecast in Sinhala and Tamil medium mainly targeting the Advanced Level students, who study the subject of Economics.

CBS also conducted in-depth post evaluation processes in order to improve programme modules, the delivery quality of lectures and other services offered in line with rapid innovations in financial technology. The Programme Calendar for 2020 was prepared with careful assessment of the present and future training needs of the Central Bank and other financial institutions, and new programmes on emerging technologies in digital banking and payments have also been introduced while striving to maintain high standards in all aspects of CBS programmes.

4. COMMUNICATIONS

During 2019, Communications Department (CMD) continued its role of supporting the accomplishment of the mandated objectives of the Central Bank, i.e., maintaining economic and price stability and financial system stability through timely communication of information pertaining to the monetary policy, financial system stability, agency functions and corporate services of the Central Bank. In addition to direct communication via speeches, lectures, meetings and seminars, CMD used several media to communicate with its stakeholders, i.e., the Bank’s corporate website (www.cbsl.gov.lk), social media, publications, newspapers, electronic media, and video clips.

4.1 External Communication

CMD continued providing information through the corporate website to the public in Sinhala, Tamil and English languages, with the aim of providing better dissemination of information for web users such as professionals, the public, media, and students to ensure efficient and speedy accessibility to information with user friendly interfaces including mobile browser compatibility.

In 2019, CMD issued 1,202 press releases, including those on the monetary policy review and decisions of the Monetary Board in relation to financial institutions and financial markets. Eight press conferences on monetary policy review were held in 2019 and CMD started live streaming the press conferences on the official Central Bank social media platforms from November 2019. Meanwhile, 107 press notices including advertisements and 05 Gazette notifications were issued to the media in 2019. CMD also sent out 494 SMS alerts pertaining to Telegraphic Transfer (exchange) rates, SLIBOR rates and policy rates.

5. CURRENCY

The Central Bank has the sole right and authority to issue currency in Sri Lanka under the powers vested by Section 49 of the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949 (MLA). Accordingly, Currency Department (CRD) of the Central Bank handles functions related to the statutory responsibility of the Monetary Board on currency operations. During 2019, CRD continued to perform several tasks related to designing and printing of currency notes, minting of coins, issuing of currency notes and coins to meet public demand, accepting currency deposits from LCBs, withdrawing unfit currency notes and coins from circulation, assisting law

enforcement authorities to deal with instances of violation of provisions of MLA with respect to the legal tender and conducting public awareness programmes to enhance public knowledge on identification of counterfeit notes and good handling practices of currency preserving its quality. A summary of the activities of CRD and currency operations during 2019 is given below.

5.1 Currency in Circulation

Demand for currency notes and coins continued to increase in 2019 except for the moderation during May – July 2019 mainly due to contraction of economic activities following the Easter Sunday attacks as shown in the Chart II-1.

5.2 Currency Management

Functions of Currency Management mainly comprise issuance of good quality currency notes and coins into

circulation and withdrawal of unfit (unserviceable) currency notes and coins from circulation facilitating payment mechanisms in the country. In order to ensure effective currency management, CRD continued the following activities during the year 2019.

(a) Currency Printing and Minting

CRD placed orders for 175 million pieces of new currency notes for the year 2019 in order to meet the demand and maintain sufficient stocks. CRD received 639.4 million pieces of new coins as a part of the 970 million pieces of coin order placed in 2017.

(b) Issuance of Currency

During the year, CRD focused on reissuing fit (serviceable) currency notes back into circulation to minimise the cost incurred on printing new currency notes. Accordingly, in 2019, CRD issued currency notes for the value of Rs. 775.2 billion into circulation, which comprised Rs. 526.5 billion of fit currency notes and Rs. 248.7 billion of new currency notes. Further, coins for the value of Rs. 1 billion were issued to LCBs and public counters established at Pettah Branch of Bank of Ceylon and currency counters at the Central Bank (Table II-6). The decrease in currency note issues in 2019 in comparison to the previous year was mainly due to the large volume of new notes issued during 2018 consequent to the strict implementation of the policy on willfully mutilated and defaced currency notes. Issuance of coins has slightly decreased in 2019 reflecting a low demand for coins among the public.

(c) Acceptance of Currency Deposits

CRD accepts currency deposits from LCBs, primarily to maintain the statutory reserve requirement imposed by the Central Bank. CRD also accepts unfit currency notes including damaged currency notes from LCBs to remove those from circulation to maintain good quality notes in circulation. Value of currency notes deposited by LCBs during 2015 to 2019 is given in Table II-7.

Deposits of unfit notes have decreased in 2019 compared to unprecedented amount of unfit deposits recorded in 2018 due to the deadline imposed on all LCBs to deposit willfully mutilated and defaced currency notes by 30 September 2018.

5.3 Other Activities

(a) Operating Currency Counters

CRD reopened a counter on 27 March 2019 at the Central Bank Head Office to provide currency exchange facility to the general public. This facility was suspended in the aftermath of the bomb blast in 1996. Further, the facility to exchange damaged currency notes continued during 2019, through which currency notes amounting to Rs. 116 million were exchanged.

(b) Operating Economic History Museum

The Economic History Museum (EHM) provides information to the general public, including foreigners who are interested in Sri Lankan currency notes and coins. Sale of commemorative notes, coins and collector items and conducting demonstrations to visitors were some of the key functions carried out by EHM. The EHM was visited by 9,060 individuals in 2019 including 2,301 locals, 511 foreigners and 6,248 students from 100 schools.

(c) Preserving Public Confidence in Currency

CRD continued to work in cooperation with the Counterfeit Currency Bureau of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to minimise the incidence of counterfeit notes and to preserve public confidence in currency.

Accordingly, CRD facilitated the certification of 2,266 counterfeit notes, which were detected and referred to the Central Bank. The rate of counterfeit notes detected is around 2 notes per million notes in circulation indicating a substantially low level of incidence of

counterfeiting compared to many other countries. 127 certificates were issued as conclusive evidence for the imitation of currency note to facilitate court proceedings in terms of the Section 59 of the MLA, and CRD attended 7 court cases relating to counterfeiting during the year.

(d) Promoting Clean Note Policy

The strict implementation of the policy against willfully mutilation and defacement of currency notes appeared to be largely successful. Key stakeholders and general public have acknowledged that willfully mutilated and defaced currency notes are now barely seen in circulation. CRD continued educating the public on good handling practices of currency and monitored LCBs on orderly conduct of clean note policy as good handling of currency notes increases the life span of currency notes.

(e) Promoting Public Awareness

CRD conducted 16 awareness programmes on security features of currency notes and identification of counterfeit notes, good handling practices and clean note policy, regulations on currency management targetting various sectors of the society through public lectures, seminars, training programmes and print media. Furthermore, CRD carried out an awareness campaign through national newspapers on the identification of counterfeits. CRD participated in 3 exhibitions demonstrating the mobile currency museum which helped enhance public awareness on currency notes and coins.

(f) 10th Asia Cash Cycle Seminar

The Central Bank co-hosted the 10th Asia Cash Cycle Seminar – 2019 (formally known as International Commercial Cash Operations Seminar (ICCOS)) in Colombo with the participation of 180 delegates from over 34 countries. The event was a platform to share views and ideas on cost saving technologies, strategies and best practices to enhance efficiency and optimisation of the currency management and to showcase rapidly changing developments in the alternative modes of payment methodologies in the world.

(g) Coin Distribution

With a view to ensuring availability of adequate coins in circulation, CRD carried out coin distribution programmes through the Central Bank regional offices and established an exchange counter at the “Enterprise Sri Lanka National Exhibition”, which was held in Jaffna on 07-10 September 2019.

(h) Approvals for Reproduction of Currency Notes

In terms of the Monetary Board approved policy on reproduction of currency notes, CRD granted approval for 7 requests during 2019.

5.4 Developments and New Projects

(a) Survey on Currency Notes

In 2019, a survey was conducted by CRD to obtain the views of the public to identify necessary modifications and improvements to the existing currency note series and assess the need for a new currency note series. Based on the outcomes of the survey, the Monetary Board decided to continue with same currency note series while upgrading it with advanced new security features for higher value denominated currency notes. To initiate the process, it has been decided to introduce a Rs. 2000 note under the current 11th series, modifying the existing design with advanced security features.

(b) Policy Changes on Currency Management

During 2019, CRD came up with the following policy changes to ensure an effective and efficient currency management process:

(i) Increase service charges on serviceable currency note deposits with the Central Bank to encourage LCBs to exchange excess cash among themselves for more efficient cash management.

(ii) Increase emergency cash withdrawal limit for LCBs, enabling them to cater to the increasing public demand for currency more effectively.

(c) Revamping Currency Operations

CRD initiated a project to revamp currency operations at the Central Bank Head Office during 2019 in order to increase the efficiency of currency note processing through an automated system and to increase currency note processing capacity. CRD carried out discussions with relevant authorities and obtained approval from the Cabinet of Ministers for the procurement of necessary machinery and equipment for the revamping project.

6. DOMESTIC OPERATIONS

6.1 Functions of DOD

As per the Monetary Law Act (MLA), the Domestic Operations Department (DOD) carries out several main functions in supporting the achievement of core objectives of the Central Bank. These include implementing monetary policy with active Open Market Operations (OMOs), regulating statutory reserves of Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs), acting as the banker to the commercial banks, acting as the banker and the official depository of the government, government agencies and other institutions, providing temporary advances to the government, maintaining settlement accounts for participants of the Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS), providing intraday liquidity to the RTGS participants and regulating Authorised Money Brokers.

6.2 Implementation of Monetary Policy

With the objective of maintaining short-term interest rates at a level commensurate with the prevailing monetary policy stance of the Central Bank, DOD continued to implement monetary policy. DOD relied mainly on OMOs, in signalling and steering the Average Weighted Call Money Rate (AWCMR), which serves as the operating target of the current enhanced monetary policy framework, towards desired level with low volatility environment. Meanwhile, the standing facilities were provided continuously to the market participants to address liquidity needs on an overnight basis. Accordingly, monetary policy operating procedure in 2019 continued to evolve with certain changes in the nature and frequency of use of OMOs, policy rates, the effective policy signalling, enhanced transparency, etc.

As excessive reliance on OMO facilities by Standalone Primary Dealers (SPDs) affected the efficiency of the signalling effect of OMOs, the access to the OMO auctions by SPDs was restricted by the Central Bank from 25 September 2018. However, in view of providing overnight liquidity assistance for SPDs and eliminating undue pressure on the AWCMR during the period of liquidity shortage, a Liquidity Support Facility (LSF) was introduced by the Central Bank in September 2019 to ensure smooth functioning of the domestic money market. LSF also helped to improve the signalling of OMOs.

Considering the anticipated movements in the liquidity condition in the domestic money market and the low demand for outright purchase of Treasury bill auctions, the Central Bank expanded the coverage for eligible instruments by introducing outright purchase of Treasury bonds auctions to inject durable liquidity to the domestic money market since mid-September 2019.

6.2.1 Open Market Operations

(a) Liquidity forecast

DOD estimates different aspects of domestic money market liquidity on a daily basis to address liquidity needs through appropriate market operations in consistent with the monetary policy stance. In this regard, impact of monetary operations initiated by the Central Bank as well as autonomous factors that have high uncertainty in estimation comprising currency in circulation, foreign exchange transactions of the Central Bank, commercial bank reserve positions and transactions of the government with the Central Bank are taken into consideration.

(b) Market Operations Committee

The Market Operations Committee (MOC) is entrusted with the task of translating overall monetary policy considerations adopted by the Monetary Board into daily monetary operations. Upon reviewing daily market developments in the domestic money and foreign exchange markets, MOC decides on the action in relation

Part II

to liquidity management, taking into consideration the estimated liquidity condition, desired level of the operating target, liquidity distribution among market participants, the need for appropriate market signals, etc.

(c) Auctions

DOD engaged in liquidity management operations to steer the amount of bank reserves to maintain the operating target at the desired level by conducting liquidity absorption and liquidity injecting auctions appropriately.

(i) Repo Auctions

In 2019, DOD conducted overnight, short-term and long term repo auctions as necessary to absorb excess liquidity from the domestic money market. Accordingly, overnight repo auctions were conducted to absorb liquidity on an overnight basis when the money market liquidity was in surplus. Short-term repo auctions were conducted as a strategy to absorb liquidity up to a period of one week on the same day settlement basis. Long-term repo auctions were conducted with settlement on the next business day with the view to absorb excess market liquidity which appeared persistent for a considerable period.

(ii) Reverse Repo Auctions

Reverse repo auctions were conducted to inject liquidity in to the domestic money market on overnight, short-term and long-term basis. In addition, Liquidity Support Facility (LSF) was introduced for SPDs in September 2019 to fulfill their overnight funding needs.

(iii) Outright Auctions

During 2019, outright purchase auctions were conducted with Participating Institutions (PIs) to inject durable liquidity into the money market by

transferring the ownership of securities. Auctions to purchase both Treasury bills and bonds were conducted in 2019. However, it was observed that in a liquidity shortage environment, market participants were reluctant to sell their liquid securities such as Treasury bills on a permanent basis. In view of providing permanent liquidity to the market amidst the lower demand for Treasury bills at the outright auctions, DOD introduced outright purchase of Treasury bonds with effect from 06 September 2019 by expanding its instruments for OMO.

6.2.2. Standing Facility

Standing facilities were provided throughout the year at the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) to PIs, while bounding overnight money market rates within the policy rate corridor. SDF facility was used to accept excess liquidity of PIs, while SLF facility was available to provide liquidity to PIs, when they were unable to fulfil their overnight liquidity requirements fully through the inter-bank money market and OMO auctions.

The SRR determines the minimum amount of reserves that each commercial bank should hold in terms of the provisions of the Monetary Law Act (MLA), in the settlement account with the Central Bank, in proportion to the total rupee deposit liabilities of the respective bank. DOD is responsible for both administering the maintenance of statutory reserves as per the SRR and monitoring compliance of commercial banks in this regard. The SRR applicable to rupee deposit liabilities of commercial banks was reduced by 100 basis points to 5.00 per cent from 6.00 per cent with effect from 01 March 2019.

6.2.4 Bank Rate

The Bank Rate is the rate of interest at which the Central Bank provides short term advances to LCBs under Section 87 of the MLA. The Bank Rate remained unchanged at 15 per cent in 2019. However, the Central Bank did not lend funds to any LCB at this rate during 2019.

6.3 Banker to Commercial Banks and the Government

6.3.1 Accounts of Financial Institutions

LCBs and SPDs are connected to the monetary system through the settlement accounts with the Central Bank. These accounts are maintained at the DOD to facilitate clearance of payments and settlement and also for settlement of payments for scripless securities transactions among Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) participants. Further, LCBs use the same accounts for maintenance of their bank reserves. DOD is responsible for updating RTGS by accounting Multilateral Net Settlement Balances (MLNSB) of LCBs generated by the Lanka Clear Pvt. Ltd. (LCPL) during its 18 sessions on a daily basis. The Multilateral Net Settlements (MLNS) of LCBs include the net settlements of Cheque Images and Truncation System (CITS), Sri Lanka Interbank Payment System (SLIPS), Common ATM Switch (CAS), Common Electronic Fund Transfer Switch (CEFTS) and Common POS Switch (CPS). At the end of 2019, the DOD maintained RTGS accounts for 26 LCBs and 8 SPDs.

6.3.2 Government Accounts

In performing the functions relating to Central Bank’s role as the banker to the Government, DOD continued to provide banking facilities to government departments, agencies and institutions, and certain foreign entities on behalf of the Government. As at end 2019, DOD maintained 46 such accounts and handled 15,307 transactions amounting to Rs. 17,617.3 billion, during the year, on behalf of the Government. More than 85 per cent of the transactions were in relation to the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury (DST) Account, the Public Debt Department’s Current Account, the Inland Revenue Commissioner’s VAT Refund Account and the President’s Fund Account.

In terms of Section 89 of the MLA, the Central Bank provides provisional advances to the Government, free of charge, with a ceiling of 10 per cent of the estimated government revenue approved by the Parliament for a given fiscal year. At

the beginning of 2019, based on the government’s revenue estimated for the year 2019 and approved by the Parliament, provisional advance to the government was increased by Rs. 13.06 billion to Rs. 238.06 billion, from provisional advance of Rs. 225.0 billion in 2018.

6.4 Provision of Intra-day Liquidity Facility

DOD continued its role to ensure smooth and efficient operation of the RTGS system by making available intra-day funding through the Intra-day Liquidity Facility (ILF) to RTGS participants. This facility is provided free of charge against the collateral of Treasury bills and Treasury bonds, which are valued at their current market prices with a sufficient haircut to absorb any variations in market prices during the day.

The total value and the average daily value of ILF drawn during the year amounted to Rs. 15,241 billion and Rs. 62.72 billion, respectively. This indicated an increase in ILF utilisation over that of the previous year, which amounted to a total of Rs. 13,275 billion with a daily average of Rs. 55.31 billion.

6.5 Supervision of Authorised Money Brokers

With the intention of promoting efficient price discovery in the domestic money market, the Money Broking Regulations No. 1 of 2013 was issued under Section 10 (c) of the MLA, which came into effect from 15 February 2013, empowering the DOD to oversee and supervise the operations of money brokers in Sri Lanka. Subsequently, the Money Broking Regulations No. 1 of 2018 was issued with effect from 05 March 2018, repealing the Money Broking Regulations No. 1 of 2013 as amended by Money Broking Regulations No. 01 of 2016. Further, with effect from 14 February 2019, Money Broking Regulations No. 1 of 2019 was issued incorporating several new additions namely, improving fit and proper requirements, restriction of control over money broking businesses, strengthening internal controls, further improvement of reporting requirements and examinations of books. Leading to a reduction in the administrative cost arising from e-documents and reduced manual intervention on data entering/calculations, a new system to upload monthly performance report for Authorised Money Brokers (AMBs) was introduced through Central Integrated Market Monitor (CIMM) and reports are generated through Tableau software.

7. ECONOMIC RESEARCH

Under Section 25 of the Monetary Law Act (MLA) No. 58 of 1949, the Economic Research Department (ERD) is statutorily entrusted with the task of compiling data and conducting economic research for the guidance of the Monetary Board and the Governor in formulating, implementing, and executing policies and measures and for the information of the public. Accordingly, ERD continued to provide policy advice through research to preserve economic and price stability during the year. ERD engaged in improving the monetary policy formulation and analysis framework and provided research based policy recommendations and advice, which facilitated policy formulation in 2019. Further, ERD spearheaded measures to enhance monetary policy communication, while improving public awareness on topical macroeconomic issues and facilitating close cooperation with international agencies.

ERD is also vested with the responsibility of carrying out functions as the lead department in implementing two of the Central Bank’s bankwide strategic priorities during 2018-2020, namely introducing an effective flexible inflation targeting framework and implementing an International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS). With regard to the former, ERD played a lead role in the drafting process of the new Central Bank of Sri Lanka Bill, which was gazetted later in the year, by actively engaging in policy level discussions. On the implementation of the ITRS, which aims at monitoring both cross border transactions and domestic foreign currency transactions through the banking sector, ERD rolled out the preparatory process during the year.

7.1 Maintaining Economic and Price Stability

In facilitating proactive and timely monetary policy decisions to maintain economic and price stability, ERD continued to closely monitor the trends and developments in the real, external, fiscal, and monetary sectors of the domestic economy as well as the global economy. Accordingly,

fulfilling its duties as the secretariat of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), ERD produced comprehensive reports to the MPC on economic and monetary conditions including forward looking analyses supported by model based macroeconomic projections. This enabled the MPC to make informed judgements and provide proactive policy recommendations to the Monetary Board on the appropriate monetary policy stance of the Central Bank. With the view to strengthening the monetary policy decision making process by incorporating inputs from the experts in academia and the private sector, ERD continued to facilitate the meetings of the Monetary Policy Consultative Committee (MPCC). Moreover, ERD coordinated the preparation of the annual policy statement Road Map 2020 - Monetary and Financial Sector Policies for 2020 and Beyond, in which the Central Bank announced its policies for monetary and financial sectors in the medium term, thereby providing information to all stakeholders in the economy and the financial market on the policy direction of the Central Bank in the period ahead. ERD continued to assess risks arising from macroeconomic developments and the possible impact of such risks on inflation and economic growth. Further, ERD enlightened the senior management on various economic issues and appropriate policy measures required to maintain macroeconomic stability. The impact of announced fiscal measures on various sectors of the economy was also analysed and informed to the senior management to support the decision making process. Moreover, ERD continued to improve its inhouse modelling and forecasting capacity and infrastructure with technical assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), aimed at enhancing the monetary policy decision making and communication process further. ERD took several measures to improve external communication and enhance awareness among the general public and other stakeholders aimed at anchoring inflation expectations in line with the envisaged inflation path over the medium term. ERD continued the publication of press releases on Monetary Policy Review informing the general public of the stance of the Monetary Board. Further, ERD performed a lead role in monetary policy press conferences chaired by the Governor and attended by senior officials of the Central Bank, which provided a platform for stakeholders to receive first hand information and obtain clarifications on the monetary policy stance, and the commencement of livestreaming of the press conference proceedings in 2019 enabled a wider reach of monetary policy communication on a real time basis.

7.2 Maintaining External Sector Stability

With the view of maintaining external sector stability, ERD continued to conduct comprehensive surveillance of global and domestic economic developments and provided appropriate policy advice and recommendations to the MPC and the Monetary Board by collecting, compiling and analysing statistics related to international trade and

external finance. Accordingly, ERD continued to assess relative movements of the Sri Lankan rupee against other currencies to identify emerging pressures on the rupee and propose corrective measures to lessen any excessive volatility in the exchange rate. Apart from analysing and providing observations on various external sector related matters, ERD continued to evaluate monetary implications of a number of foreign loans obtained by the government, as per the provisions of the MLA. Further, ERD monitored the progress in relation to the quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets and structural benchmarks agreed upon under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of the IMF. While taking measures to improve the compilation and dissemination of external sector statistics to comply with internationally accepted data reporting standards, ERD continued the publication of Balance of Payments (BOP) statistics and International Investment Position (IIP) statistics in the BPM6 format on a quarterly basis and International Reserve Data Template (RDT) on a monthly basis, while making timely submissions related to Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) to the World Bank and direct investment data for the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS) on an annual basis. In order to improve accuracy and ensure timeliness of external sector data, ERD conducted several surveys during the year, which included an Annual International Investment Survey (AIIS), to collect data on foreign assets and liabilities of the private sector and surveys related to trade in services covering resident and non-resident airlines, shipping lines, telecommunications, construction and insurance sectors and a monthly survey on inward workers’ remittances. Further, as the lead department in implementing the ITRS, ERD commenced preliminary work such as identifying system requirements, inter departmental data needs, the legal framework and required IT infrastructure.

7.3 Providing Proactive Policy Advice

ERD continued to provide proactive policy advice to the Monetary Board, the government and other stakeholders mainly on monetary policy, exchange rate policy, international trade and fiscal sector related issues. In view of the postponement of the presentation of the National Budget for 2019, a report summarising the developments and risks of the economy was submitted to the Hon. Minister of Finance prior to the announcement of the Budget in March 2019. In compliance with Section 116 (1) of the MLA, the September 15th Report, the confidential report articulating the developments and risks in the economy was submitted to the Hon. Minister of Finance by the statutory deadline on 15 September 2019. ERD provided technical inputs to the National Economic Council (NEC) and provided independent observations on various macroeconomic issues to the government. ERD coordinated eight MPC meetings during the year 2019. Apart from serving as a member of the MPC, the Director of Economic Research (DER) continued to serve as a member of a number of internal committees,

including the Market Operations Committee (MOC), the Financial System Stability Committee (FSSC), the Domestic Debt Management Committee (DDMC), Tender Boards for the issuance of government securities, Training Committee, Library Advisory Committee, Steering Committee and Tender Board for International Sovereign Bond Issuance by the Government of Sri Lanka in 2019 and the Steering Committee for the Organisation of 70th Anniversary Celebrations of the Central Bank. Further, during the year, the DER served as an observer in the Internal Investment Oversight Committee (IIOC) and the International Reserve Investment Oversight Committee (IRIOC). The DER and senior members of ERD made presentations at the regular meetings including the Monetary Board and meetings of Chairpersons and Chief Executive Officers of financial institutions, covering macroeconomic developments and subjects of topical interest. The senior staff of ERD also served in the MPC and several other internal committees.

The DER and senior staff of ERD represented the Central Bank in numerous committees and boards of external institutions, including the Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute (HARTI), National Science Foundation, and several committees appointed by the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Power and Energy. The Technical Evaluation Committee on the project of constructing a power plant at Kerawalapitiya, Project Committees on the Rehabilitation on the Northern Part of Elephant Pass Saltern, Restructuring of the Paranthan Chemicals Company Ltd., Restructuring of Lanka Mineral Sands Ltd., Committee to Conduct an Analysis on the Vehicle Assembly Industry, and other national level committees such as Technical Core Committee for National Export Strategy, National Trade Facilitation Committee (NTFC), Government Finance Statistics (GFS) Coordinating Committee, Technical Committee for the Designing of Carbon Pricing Instruments for the Energy and Transport Sectors of Sri Lanka, Sectoral Oversight Committee on Education and Human Resources Development on Adopting STEM Policy in the Education System in Sri Lanka, Advisory Committee on Trade Promotion and Information of Export Development Board and the Joint Committee on Formulating the Medium term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS) were among the other external committees in which ERD staff served in 2019.

The half-yearly report of Recent Economic Developments - Highlights of 2019 and Prospects for 2020 and Monthly Bulletins were also published in 2019. Further, Road Map 2020 - Monetary and Financial Sector Policies for 2020 and Beyond, the policy statement of the Central Bank, was prepared for the thirteenth year with the purpose of enhancing the predictability and transparency of the Central Bank’s policies, which would help stakeholders to design and better calibrate their own plans and strategies for the period ahead, and was announced by the Governor on 06 January 2020. In addition, ERD continued to disseminate economic and financial information through daily, weekly and monthly indicators and bulletins published in the media and the online data library available on the Central Bank website. Moreover, to enhance the awareness of the general public, media statements were released on regular monetary policy review and external sector developments, which included latest monetary statistics, interest rate statistics, balance of payments and other external sector statistics. Statistics covering all sectors of the economy were disseminated by ERD, adhering to the requirements of the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).

7.5 Engaging in Policy Research and Knowledge Sharing

ERD continued to promote the research culture within the Department and the Central Bank through various research and knowledge sharing activities. The Research Advisory Panel (RAP), an internal committee of ERD that is responsible for key research related tasks, continued its activities during the year. RAP continued to successfully coordinate, assisted by the Centre for Banking Studies (CBS), the training course on Research in Economics, to develop research orientation and acquaint participants both within the Central Bank and external institutions, with relevant methodological foundations and techniques of academic research, primarily in economics, while spearheading the training of postgraduate aspirants of the Central Bank in the fields of macroeconomics, microeconomics and mathematics for economics.

ERD organised the Central Bank’s annual flagship research event, the International Research Conference (IRC) in December 2019 for the twelfth consecutive year. The conference was aimed at stimulating theoretical and empirical research on various contemporary macroeconomic policy issues and provided researchers from diverse backgrounds a platform to discuss their views, findings and experiences from varied perspectives. The IRC-2019 was graced by two eminent international economists; Professor Sayuri Shirai of Keio University, who is also a visiting scholar at the Asian Development Bank Institute and a former Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan who delivered a speech titled Recent Monetary Policy Issues and Challenges, and Mr. Marc-Olivier Strauss-Kahn, Honorary

Director General and former Chief Economist of Banque de France who spoke on Central Banking: from Research to Economic and Financial Literacy. Seven research papers on contemporary topics such as monetary policy, public investment, productivity and taxation selected through a rigorous double-blind review process, were presented by researchers participating from the USA, Australia, India and Sri Lanka, including researchers from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Dr. D S Wijesinghe Memorial Award for the best research paper presented at the IRC was awarded to an officer of ERD.

In addition, ERD co-organised a regional conference on External Vulnerabilities in South Asia with the World Bank-South Asia Office, Institute of Policy Studies and the University of Colombo during 28 February – 01 March 2019. At this conference, several scholars and practitioners from six South Asian countries discussed macroeconomic issues and external risks faced by their countries, to understand the sources and solutions in a challenging global environment. The conference featured sixteen research papers, focussing on both academic and policy aspects. During the conference, two papers were presented by officers from the Central Bank including officers from ERD.

The Central Bank’s official research publication, Staff Studies, consisting of research outcomes of officers attached to ERD and other departments of the Central Bank was published in 2019 under the guidance of the RAP. Further, the staff of ERD continued publishing their research in local and international publications. In addition to the presentations made at IRC and the regional conference on External Vulnerabilities in South Asia, officers of ERD presented papers at the Third South Asian Network on Economic Modelling (SANEM) - World Bank North America Discussion Forum held in Washington D.C., the USA, the 13th Bulletin of Monetary Economics and Banking International Research Conference organised by the Bank Indonesia and the Asia-Pacific Applied Economics Association in Bali, Indonesia, as well as the Delhi Macroeconomics Workshop held in New Delhi, India.

Meanwhile, ERD actively engaged in the dissemination of knowledge in collaboration with CMD, CBS and Regional Offices of the Central Bank, for the benefit of school and university students, school teachers, officers of other government and private institutions, and foreign delegations that visited the Central Bank.

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 90

Part II

submission of EPF contribution details through electronic media became mandatory for employers with more than 50 employees in their employment. In 2011, Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) joined this system as facilitators to collect EPF contributions via their own online portals, which made a remarkable improvement in employer participation and the speed of the member accounts updating process, while strengthening its administrative and monitoring functionalities. The e-Return system achieved its highest technological breakthrough in 2016 with the introduction of the online member information validating mechanism which brought 100 per cent process automation and real time updating of member accounts. Accordingly, eight LCBs facilitate EPF online payments while four of them provide online member information validation and real time member accounts updating facility for their customers.

In addition, actions were taken to make employers further aware regarding the e-Return submission procedure and its benefits for EPF stakeholders. Accordingly, participation of employers in the e-Return submission system increased from 8,540 to 9,267, covering approximately 79 per cent of the active member accounts and nearly 88 per cent of the total monthly EPF contribution by end 2019.

Further, with a view to introducing new methodologies for paying EPF, initiatives were taken to develop the EPF official website, enabling employers to submit their e-Returns through the website and to implement the Lanka Clear’s Common Electronic Fund Transfer System, which enables employers to pay monthly contributions from any participating bank.

(vi) Re-registration of EPF Members

EPF Department, in collaboration with the DL, continued the special project to re-register its members to provide an efficient service to both members and employers, which was launched in 2010. Accordingly, actions were taken for the collection of member information as per the National Identity Card (NIC) data and re-registration of such members aligning to NIC data. The re-registration of members facilitates the identification of members with a Unique Identification (UID) Number and enables both EPF Department and the DL to establish a common Member Centric Database (MCD). Finally, this activity helps both EPF Department and the DL to provide services to its stakeholders productively through the improved quality of member information.

NIC details of around 1.98 million active EPF members (contributing members) had been

collected. Accordingly, 1.62 million UIDs have been assigned for 81 per cent of active member accounts, while the verification of remaining member details is in progress. A system has also been established to monitor the error-free update of NIC details of all new members whose member contributions are received for the first-time, on a monthly basis. Further, actions are in progress to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Department for Registration of Persons (DRP) to strengthen the process of re-registration by obtaining the access to DRP database.

(vii) Other Services

The EPF Department strives for an efficient and effective delivery of services to its members. In today’s fast paced environment members demand excellent service delivery. Thus, the Public Relations and Inquiries Counter of EPF Department met with a challenging task in 2019. In 2019, the number of member/employer visits to the Department is recorded as 156,898, while EPF Department had received 77,310 member inquiries through telephone calls and 8,713 member inquiries through e-mails. EPF Department also received 84,550 letters in 2019 from members, employers and other stakeholders.

The Department also receives a large number of member requests through letters and through the members visiting EPF Department, for amendment/correction of details in their member accounts. In 2019, EPF Department performed approximately 72,313 amendments in EPF Member Accounts. The Amendments performed in EPF member accounts can be mainly categorised into two components: error correction in Name/NIC details of an EPF member account and corrections of contributions credited to a member account. During the year 2019, EPF Department performed 67,083 Name/NIC amendments and 5,230 Account Amendments. Further, with the implementation of the Image Scanning Project, the facility for the performance of EPF member account amendments was extended to the Regional Offices of the Central Bank. Accordingly, during year, EPF Department attended to 12,944 EPF member account amendments referred from Regional Offices of the Bank.

(f) Other Functions

Furthermore, the EPF Department is in the process of reviewing and restructuring its investment strategy and framework under the Financial Sector Modernisation Project of the World Bank (WB) and the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL). Furthermore, the WB is providing financial assistance for the implementation of a

comprehensive ICT solution for the EPF. In view of this, a Business Process Review (BPR) has been conducted with the technical assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) under the Capital Market Development Programme GOSL and ADB.

9. FACILITIES MANAGEMENT

Facilities Management Department (FMD) continued the preliminary assessment works and preparation of tender documents with the assistance of the project consultant in 2019 for implementing the Head Office Building Retrofit Project where a major refurbishment of the building interior, plant and equipment is envisaged. Assessment of structural soundness of the building was completed during the period and the procurement process was initiated for refurbishment of sanitary facilities and retrofit of the electro mechanical equipment related to the water supply and fire-fighting systems. As a part of this project, the installation work was initiated for replacement of the standby generator control system, IP based CCTV system and refurbishment of the emergency staircase at the Head Office building. As a measure of strengthening the security of the Head Office building, fixed barriers and a security gate were installed at the main entry points.

During 2019, FMD took initiatives to upgrade the building facilities at Regional Offices (ROs) and Centre for Banking Studies (CBS) in Rajagiriya. FMD initiated a project to replace the existing passenger elevators at CBS and the RO, Anuradhapura. New projects were implemented for replacement of sewage pumping system at CBS, replacement of air conditioning equipment at the auditorium of CBS and upgrading the power supply system at the RO, Matale. Refurbishment of part of the hostel block at CBS was completed during 2019 in line with the initiative by CBS to provide in-house accommodation facilities for course participants. A project for carrying out structural repairs at Lloyd’s Building, where EPF Department is located, was also initiated.

With the aim of catering to the requirements of the staff of the Central Bank who travel outstation on duty and for holidays, FMD initiated measures to upgrade the available holiday home facilities. Architectural designs of the proposed new holiday home facility in Anuradhapura were finalised in 2019. A structural audit was carried out with the assistance of a consultant to assess the soundness of the old holiday home buildings in Kataragama. Further, at the Bank House premises, improvements to the landscaping and building rectification work were carried out, while the procurement process was completed for installation of new standby generators to cater the emergency power requirements.

FMD undertook several administrative measures to streamline its facilities management activities in 2019. The online reservation system for holiday homes introduced for the benefit of the employees and pensioners was linked with

the payroll system to improve accuracy of the transactions and convenience of the users. FMD also initiated measures to introduce an online cab voucher system for the users of hired cabs for official transport. In order to meet the current vehicle parking requirement of the staff, FMD was able to provide additional parking facilities with the assistance of the Urban Development Authority (UDA). While attending to new projects for upgrading and expansions, FMD continued to maintain the critical services of the buildings, and provided necessary support services in transport and telecommunication aspects as part of its key responsibilities.

The FIU, which was established in 2006 under the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 6 of 2006 (FTRA), functions as an independent statutory authority and acts as the lead AML/CFT regulator of the country. In addition, FIU has provided a comprehensive coverage for the country’s financial and non-financial establishments to comply with the AML/CFT regulations issued by Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and supervised by FATF jointly with Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG). The key functions of FIU include collection and receipt of information on financial transactions for the purpose of detecting possible links to Money Laundering

Part II

Part II - 93

(ML), Terrorist Financing (TF), Proliferation Financing (PF) and other related unlawful activities defined in the FTRA, analysis of suspicious financial transactions relating to the above unlawful activities and dissemination of information of such analyses to relevant law enforcement authorities for investigation. The country’s AML/CFT regime also consists of two other major pieces of legislation, i.e., the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, No. 5 of 2006 (PMLA) and Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act, No. 25 of 2005 (CSTFA), where FIU is involved in implementing their provisions effectively.

11.1 Receipt, Analysis and Dissemination of Information

In terms of the mandatory requirements, Reporting Institutions (RIs) continued to submit information on financial transactions, including suspicious transactions, from RIs through a web-based system, “LankaFin”, especially designed to assist in reporting on ML and TF. Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs), Licensed Specialised Banks (LSBs), Licensed Finance Companies (LFCs), Insurance Companies, Stock Brokers (SBs) and Money or Value Transfer Service (MVTS) providers continued to report to FIU on Cash Transactions (CTRs) and Electronic Funds Transfers (EFTs) (both local and foreign) of Rs. 1.0 million and above each, or its equivalent in foreign currencies. Accordingly, during 2019, RIs have reported 4.9 million (provisional) CTRs and 6.6 million (provisional) EFTs. In addition, Suspicious Transactions Reports (STRs) were reported to FIU by the RIs in terms of Section 7 of the FTRA. After operational and strategic analyses, STRs were referred to the Law Enforcement Authorities (LEAs) and regulatory authorities, for further investigation. 2,806 STRs were reported to FIU during 2019 and FIU disseminated a total of 1,478 STRs to the LEAs and regulatory authorities for further investigations.

11.2 Regulation of Reporting Institutions

With a view to strengthening the AML/CFT supervision process and institutional compliance, FIU issues Regulations, rules and guidelines to Financial Institutions (FIs) as well as Designated Non Finance Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs). Accordingly, FIU issued several rules and guidelines during the year 2019 on suspicious transactions reporting, conducting ongoing customer due diligence on a risk-based approach, enhanced due diligence, identification of beneficial ownership and identification of Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs). FIU continuously took measures to enhance compliance of RIs by effective monitoring and enforcement, onsite and offsite surveillance, raising awareness through seminars and conducting compliance review meetings on AML/CFT to RIs. In line with that, FIU conducted 32 and 36 risk-based onsite examinations to FIs and DNFBPs, respectively, to assess such institutions’ compliance with the FTRA, Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Rules, and other regulations and rules issued. Further, FIU took regulatory actions, such as imposing sanctions, issuing warning letters, and initiated follow up discussions with FIs and DNFBPs which failed to comply with the AML/CFT requirements.

11.3 Domestic and International Cooperation

(a) Memoranda of Understanding

In 2019, FIU entered into two Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with Financial Intelligence Unit of Maldives and Financial Analysis and Supervision Unit of Papua New Guinea, increasing the total number of MoUs with foreign counterparties to 39.

(b) Egmont Group

FIU obtained assistance from members of the Egmont Group, the Association of FIUs consisting of 164 member FIUs globally, in order to carry out investigations and collaborate with member countries to gather intelligence on their investigations. FIU – Sri Lanka responded to 40 requests from counterpart FIUs and it also made 58 requests from counterpart FIUs to share information relating to on-going investigations during 2019. Further, FIU officers participated in the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units’ meetings held in Jakarta, Indonesia in January 2019 and the Egmont Plenary meeting held in Hague, Netherlands where Mr. D M Rupasinghe, Director, FIU - Sri Lanka was appointed as the Asia & Pacific Regional representative of the Egmont Group. The Asia & Pacific Regional Group of the Egmont Group comprises 28 FIUs in the region. Every two years, two senior officers from FIUs in the region are appointed to represent the Asia & Pacific region in the Egmont Group.

(c) Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG)

A team of officials from Sri Lanka representing key institutions participated for the 22nd APG Annual Meeting and Technical Assistance forum held during 18-23 August, 2019 in Canberra, Australia. During the meeting, the 4th follow up report of Sri Lanka was discussed. After constructive debate, the membership granted approval to upgrade the compliance rating of 4 recommendations previously rated non-compliant or partially compliant. Accordingly, out of 40 FATF recommendations, Sri Lanka’s rating stood as, 7 compliant, 24 largely compliant, 7 partially compliant and 2 non-compliant by end 2019.

(d) BIMSTEC Sub-Group on Combating the Financing of Terrorism (BIMSTEC SG-CFT)

FIU successfully conducted the BIMSTEC SG-CFT Workshop on the theme of “Experience in Countering Terrorism and Terrorist Financing through Case Studies” in Colombo from 27 to 29 November, 2019 with the participation of 40 delegates from BIMSTEC member countries.

share Sri Lanka’s experience in Countering Terrorism and Terrorist Financing with other members of the BIMSTEC. Further, FIU officials participated in the 11th meeting of the BIMSTEC Sub-Group on Anti- Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism held in Thailand in September 2019.

(e) Knowledge Sharing with Other FIUs

FIU hosted a team of officials from Financial Intelligence Unit of Maldives for a four day study visit during 2-5 December, 2019. The study visit mainly focused on sharing experiences on AML/CFT risk based supervision, analysis of suspicious transactions, and sharing Sri Lankan experiences on Mutual Evaluation and National Risk Assessment on ML/TF. FIU Sri Lanka intends to continue this initiative with other FIUs in the region in order to further strengthen the cooperation among FIUs.

11.4 Institutional Capacity Building and Awareness Programmes

Continuing the efforts to enhance the awareness on detecting, analysing and reporting of ML and TF related transactions, 55 awareness/training programmes were conducted during the year, accommodating 3,688 participants. The 6th and 7th Technical Assistance Missions of the IMF were conducted by experts from the IMF in March and October 2019, respectively. The Missions continued to provide technical assistance to enhance AML/CFT regime in Sri Lanka, in the areas of risk-based supervision, FIU capacity developments and legislative amendments. Further, the Resident Advisor from the US Department of Treasury also continued to provide technical assistance in the areas of FIU Operational Effectiveness, Financial Sector Supervision and AML/CFT Case Development and Asset Management. With the generous sponsorship provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), FIU was able to get technical assistance from an expert from Finland FIU, on a two week consultation mission on configuration of goAML application.

11.5 Review by International Cooperation Review Group

The 2nd Mutual Evaluation (ME) on Sri Lanka was conducted during 2014/15 by the APG with the intention of assessing Sri Lanka’s AML/CFT compliance on the international AML/CFT standards. The Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) adopted in September 2015 recommended a series of actions to be implemented by Sri Lanka under APG’s ‘expedite enhanced follow up’ process. In October 2016, the FATF informed that Sri Lanka would be subject to a review of the International Cooperation Review Group (ICRG) of the FATF to assess the progress of AML/CFT effectiveness. After several discussions and progress reports, the FATF informed that Sri Lanka had not made sufficient progress in 4 areas, namely International Cooperation, Supervision, Legal Persons and Arrangements and Targeted Financial Sanctions on Proliferations (North Korea & Iran). As a result, the FATF at its Plenary held at

Buenos Aires, Argentina in October 2017, listed Sri Lanka as a jurisdiction with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies in the FATF’s Compliance Document which is more commonly identified as the “Grey List”. Upon listing, a time bound action plan to address the strategic deficiencies identified was provided to Sri Lanka.

Since the listing in November, 2017, Sri Lankan authorities have taken effective and tangible steps to implement the FATF Action Plan, including passing the Trusts (Amendment) Act, No. 6 of 2018, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Amendment) Act, No. 24 of 2018, issuing regulations/directives/guidelines on implementing United Nation’s Security Council Resolutions on Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Iran, extending the AML/CFT coverage to DNFBPs by issuing CDD Rules, implementing risk based supervision, enforcing supervisory actions and conducting awareness programmes for financial institutions and DNFBPs.

The FATF assessed Sri Lanka’s progress in implementing the Action Plan through the Asia Pacific Joint Group (AP/JG). In February 2019, FATF made the initial determination that Sri Lanka has completed its action plan substantially. Subsequently, an on-site assessment was conducted by the AP/JG to verify implementation of the FATF Action Plan, from 16 to 17 September, 2019. The AP/JG representatives had face-to-face meetings with all relevant stakeholders, including the private sector and the Minister of Finance to ascertain Sri Lanka’s political and institutional commitment towards the implementation of AML/CFT framework in a suitable manner. The recommendations made by the review team on Sri Lanka’s progress were discussed at the FATF Plenary held in October 2019 and all members endorsed the decision to delist Sri Lanka from the Grey List. Accordingly, on 18 October 2019, the FATF announced that Sri Lanka is no longer subject to the FATF monitoring process. The delisting by the FATF is expected to have a positive economic and financial impact on Sri Lanka.

12. FOREIGN EXCHANGE

(a) Delivering cost-effective business solutions

The Management Trainee (MT) Recruitment System was revamped to cater to the new recruitment process which resulted in a significant reduction of manual work and saving of more than 1000 man hours of the Human Resources Department (HRD). The system facilitated online application submission and real-time validations which in turn reduced human errors, saved space and cost, thereby contributing to increased efficiencies of HRD in a short time.

The LankaSecure System, which settles government securities and operates as the Central Securities Depository, was improved with SMS and E-Mail notifications to inform ownership changes in real-time to investors. This development paved the way to attract more investors to the market via uplifted investor confidence. Similarly, the Treasury Bond Auction System for government securities, PDOffice, was improved with SMS and E-Mail notifications to inform the initiation of Phase 2, the voluntary phase of bidding, thereby providing better transparency for the auction participants.

ITD developed a compensation payment system for Resolution Enforcement Department (RED) with the iGLAS accounting functionality integrated to streamline and fast-track the process of providing compensation to depositors under the Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance and Liquidity Support Scheme (SLDILSS).

The system used for Country Wide Data Collection (CWDCS) was modified with a web interface for data editing and was enhanced with facilities for user driven reporting. It was further uplifted by ITD to support real-time data upload with zero transmission delays.

The Data Library managed by Statistics Department was enhanced with the incorporation of secondary market quotes of Public Debt Department, thereby granting the general public access to a wider variety of national data.

The Central Database System (FinNet) used by several departments to monitor information reported by the financial institutions regulated by the Bank was enhanced with the introduction of a data analytical tool to enable users to perform report generation by themselves. Users were guided and further trained for using the data analytical tool with department specific datasets.

The following up process of Monetary Board Decisions was streamlined by the implementation of the Task Tracker System for the Board Secretariat.

The ForexNet System used by Department of Foreign Exchange was further enhanced with the revamping of the Foreign Currency Sales and Purchases Monitoring Module to accommodate the reporting functionality. Moreover, ITD modified the Electronic Fund Transfer Cards (EFTC) Monitoring System to add foreign currency utilised and the number of new cards issued for additional types of credit cards and debit cards. In addition, modification of reports was carried out to be in line with the said changes.

The Open Market Operations (OMO) Securities Allocation System was enhanced to accommodate bond purchases allowing Domestic Operations Department to address structural liquidity in the domestic money market.

The core functionality of the Regional Development Loan Management System was developed to cater to the 4P (Public-Private-Producer Partnerships) Loan Scheme of Regional Development Department.

The Electronic Data Interchange interface of the Currency Management System (CMS), which is used to cater emergency currency withdrawal requirements of Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs), was improved to incorporate new regulations imposed by Currency Department.

A Risk Reporting System was developed for Risk Management Department with risk registers and matrices in accordance with international best practices to automate and streamline the bank’s risk mitigation process.

ITD managed to successfully incorporate the new PAYE tax scheme to its internal systems at the end of the financial year and assisted Finance Department to submit employee tax reports to the Inland Revenue Department in a timely manner.

With the introduction of the new document management system, over 300,000 documents were scanned and made easily accessible, eliminating challenges in dealing with physical documents.

(b) Continuous enhancements of the ICT infrastructure

ICT infrastructure of the Bank was continuously upgraded during 2019 to ensure its information systems are resilient and on par with the latest technology advancements.

The Virtual Private Network (VPN) of the Bank, CBSLNet, which connects Participant Institutions to the Central Bank’s Primary site and Disaster Recovery (DR) site to access business critical systems, was enhanced by implementing dual connectivity through two Telecommunication Service Providers to establish failover and high availability in the VPN. Further, to enhance the security of the network, end to end encryption was enforced over the VPN.

During the year, ITD initiated revamping of the existing Head Office Data Center to modern TIA 942 Rating 3 complied level. According to the said standards, a Data Center can be classified into four different ratings in relation to various levels of resiliency of the datacenter facility infrastructure. This classification is given under four segments of its infrastructure, namely, Telecommunications (T), Electrical (E), Architectural (A) and Mechanical (M). The new datacenter will have 99.982% availability in all of the above areas. Further measures were taken to implement a Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) Analyser and to study further requirements for establishing a Security Operation Centre (SOC).

(c) Contribution to Modernise National Payment System Infrastructure

ITD extended its services as an advisor and provided technical expertise for projects of national interest. ITD Officials contributed their expertise to several national projects during the year.

In order to strengthen the secondary market of government securities, measures were initiated to establish an Electronic Trading Platform (ETP) and a Central Counter Party (CCP) solution for the same. ITD officers contributed to the technical evaluation process to select a suitable consultant for project implementation.

ITD officers also provided technical assistance through the Procurement Committees (PCs) and Technical Evaluation Committees (TECs) to select a suitable consultant and completed the selection of the consultant to modernise the RTGS system of the country. Further, ICT arrangements of NSB were evaluated by ITD officers to assess their technical readiness to be considered as a participant of the RTGS system.

In addition, ITD provided technical expertise for the two committees appointed by the National Payments Council (NPC) viz., the Committee on Fintech Developments and the Working Committee on Blockchain Technology.

(d) Strengthening IT Security and Resilience

ITD took several measures to enhance IT Security and protect the Bank’s IT assets from any Cyber Security threats. As a proactive measure, continuous vulnerability assessments were carried out on business-critical IT systems to identify vulnerabilities and necessary remedial actions were taken to mitigate them and reduce exposure to Cyber-attacks.

Moreover, new and improved firewalls were introduced to further protect the Bank’s network from any imminent threats.

(e) Upgrade ICT Competencies Among the Staff

With the aim of enhancing the IT knowledge of all employees in the Bank, ITD continued to publish awareness banners on the intranet and circulate security advisory alerts through email.

In addition, the staff of ITD attended short term training both locally and abroad in order to enhance their knowledge and skills in their relevant fields.

Accordingly, a model based Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) is adopted by the Central Bank based on the liability structure of the Central Bank, which mainly considers the objectives of capital preservation, liquidity requirements, income generation and the risk tolerance of the Central Bank. Accordingly, the Central Bank foreign reserves are objectively divided into three main tranches, which comprise different portfolios and are assigned with an investment horizon, currency composition and an asset composition. Each portfolio defined under those tranches are assigned with international benchmarks. Accordingly, the performance of portfolios is reviewed against respective benchmarks in order to be in line with globally accepted best practices of performance reviewing.

During 2019, two technical assistance missions on foreign reserves management related aspects were facilitated as in-house trainings in the Central Bank with the assistance of World Bank technical experts. These missions mainly focused on the procurement process for a reserve management system by providing awareness about current sophisticated reserve management systems in the world and giving guidance on selecting a suitable service provider to cater to the requirements of the Central Bank.

16.2 Performance Analysis and Facilitation Activities

Under Performance Analysis and Facilitation, the following main functions relating to the Central Bank’s reserves management are conducted.

(a) Performance Measurement of Reserve management

IOD assesses performance of its reserve management activities on total return approach daily and presents to the IRIOC monthly, and quarterly to the Monetary Board, together with an analysis of reserve position. The returns of FIS and Money Market investments are measured against respective benchmarks according to the SAA approved by the Monetary Board. Comparison against benchmarks helps to determine the effectiveness of the active reserves management strategy by measuring the excess returns generated over the benchmarks. This approach is useful in identifying whether the return objective of management of reserves is achieved to a reasonable extent by investing within the approved guidelines. Risk adjusted portfolio performance measures such as Information ratio and Tracking error were also used to measure the effectiveness of portfolio diversification. The performance attribution methodology was continued in 2019 to further elaborate total returns generated through foreign reserves management. This process helps to evaluate the performance of the portfolios by measuring returns generated by various sources of risk factors, and the resulting findings are used as value adding inputs in the Central Bank’s foreign reserve management strategy.

(b) Calculation of International Reserves and Maintaining the Database on Foreign Currency Reserves

IOD is responsible for calculation of the Central Bank Reserve and Official International Reserves figures daily and provision of relevant information on reserve figures to Economic Research Department (ERD) of the Central Bank. Further, IOD reconciles the month end reserves

position with the reserves value in the Central Bank Balance Sheet in coordination with ERD and Finance Department.

(c) Administration of Treasury Management System (TMS)

IOD, the main user of the TMS, is responsible for the general administration function of the system and ensures proper coordination among other user Departments, the software provider and its local partner. Accordingly, IOD ensures that the TMS is updated with relevant modifications/ patches and is fully connected with internal systems such as Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT), Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and General Ledger (GL) as well as external interfaces such as Bloomberg and Reuters to ensure efficient functioning of TMS related procedures and processes. In 2019, IOD commenced the procurement process for acquiring a new Reserve Management System as the license for the existing TMS will expire in late 2021.

(d) Annual Review of Existing Counterparties for their Adherence/Compliance to/with Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Combating Financing of Terrorism (CFT)

During 2019, IOD carried out its “Know Your Customer (KYC)/ Customer Due Diligence (CDD) rules for the foreign counterparties of the Central Bank ” to ensure compliance with rules and regulations and international best practices in relation to AML and CFT with regard to management of foreign reserves. As a measure of adopting the international standards for KYC review, the Central Bank is in the process of registering with the SWIFT KYC Registry which is an internationally accepted KYC Data Repository.

16.3 Domestic Foreign Exchange Market Developments

During the year, IOD made continuous efforts to ensure smooth operations in the domestic foreign exchange market, allowing more flexibility while curbing excess volatility in the exchange rate.

(a) Intervention in the Domestic Foreign Exchange (FX) Market

The Central Bank continued to intervene in the domestic FX market as and when required in order to curb any undue volatility in the exchange rate in 2019. Intervention was carried out through Request for Quote (RFQ) mechanism, which was introduced in 2018, helped improve the market transparency as well as the non-borrowed portion of the Forex Reserves.

(b) Dissemination of Information

IOD continued to publish USD/LKR indicative exchange rate along with indicative exchange rates for fifty six

world currencies and average Telegraphic Transfer buying and selling exchange rates of LCBs against LKR for nine major currencies, on the Central Bank web site on a daily basis. In addition, IOD discharged its duties on dissemination of information by providing exchange rate data to government organisations and various other parties including the general public at their request.

(c) Revision to Net Open Position (NOP)

Since unexpected significant flows to the domestic foreign exchange market could exert undue pressure on the exchange rate, resulting in excessive volatility, the NOP limits applicable to foreign exchange operations of some licensed banks were revised to facilitate such flows, on a case by case basis, during 2019.

(d) Affiliation with Market Participants

IOD conducted Treasurers’ meetings with licensed commercial banks on a bi-annual basis, in order to discuss their concerns pertaining to the market developments and initiated several measures to overcome such issues with a view to streamlining the FX market operations. In this regard, obtaining and publishing TT rates on a daily basis were automated by linking the Central Integrated Market Monitoring (CIMM) system and International Operations Management System (IOMS).

(e) Observation on Market Sentiments

As a crucial department responsible for monitoring the domestic FX market activities, IOD continued to provide views, observations and recommendations on various proposals, regulations, amendments and policy matters submitted by other departments of the Central Bank and external organisations, especially with regard to the possible implications of such proposals on exchange rate movements.

17. LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE

Legal and Compliance Department (LCD) is charged with the duty to facilitate enhancing the governance standards of the Central Bank in all legal and procedural aspects. With a view to achieving core statutory objectives of the Central Bank, LCD is charged with developing new laws, bringing suitable amendments to the existing laws administered by the Central Bank and further strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework thereof. In this connection, LCD performed a wide range of activities of the Central Bank in 2019 ensuring the compatibility of the legal and regulatory framework with the international standards and best practices. Key activities carried out by LCD are as follows:

Since 2018, LCD has heavily engaged in the introduction of the new Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act by repealing the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949. With the assistance of various stakeholders such as the Ministry of Finance, Attorney

Part II - 106

Part II

General’s Department and the Legal Draftsman’s Department, LCD led the process upto the publication of the Gazette relating to the draft Bill of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka with more regulatory and supervisory powers and enhanced governance standards.

With the objective of further strengthening the legal and regulatory framework of the Central Bank, the new Banking Act is currently under formulation based on the finalised concept paper, which will provide for a stronger legal foundation for the banking sector. LCD contributed to introduce necessary amendments to the Foreign Exchange Act No. 12 of 2017, with a view to expanding the supervisory powers of the Central Bank over foreign exchange transactions. Further, LCD proposed amendments to the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance No. 7 of 1937, the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No. 2 of 1990 and the Electronic Transactions Act No. 19 of 2006 to develop the financial market infrastructure.

As the compliance function of the Central Bank, LCD played a significant role in strengthening governance standards of the Central Bank and largely involved in compliance requirements of foreign counterparties engaged with the Bank in its foreign exchange operations. In addition to that, since 2019, LCD deals with requests for information received by the Information Officer of the Central Bank under the provisions of the Right to Information Act No. 12 of 2016 and defends the interests of the Central Bank in inquiries/litigations initiated by third parties, pursuant to such requests. Furthermore, LCD initiated introducing amendments to many governance driven policies namely, Whistle blowing policy, Codes of Conduct applicable for Central Bank staff and the members of the Monetary Board, whilst actively involved in the Audit Committee and the Board Risk Oversight Committee etc.

LCD successfully handled all litigation filed for and against the Central Bank during 2019 securing the interests of the Monetary Board, the Central Bank or its employees. LCD initiated legal actions against certain errant financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank and their directors. LCD continued with litigation relating to unauthorised finance companies, prohibited schemes and other issues in the financial sector, with the assistance of the Attorney General’s Department and other law enforcement agencies under the provisions of the Finance Business Act No. 42 of 2011 and the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988, with a view to safeguard the interests of the depositors and creditors of such companies.

With a view to enhancing the existing regulatory authority of the Central Bank, LCD cooperated with the other departments of the Central Bank in developing and amending regulations, directions, guidelines, operating instructions, agreements, circulars etc. relating to their operations. LCD provided observations to the provisions of new laws drafted by external parties such as International Financial Centre Bill, Data Protection Bill, Cyber Security Bill etc, and engaged in vetting of agreements, revised subsidiary legislations issued by the

Central Bank under various laws in order to ensure the legality of such instruments. LCD has provided its opinions to the other departments of the Central Bank to avoid such departments face undue legal, operational and compliance risks in their operational activities.

In view of above, the performance of LCD as one of the key assurance functions, has paved the way towards achieving the core objectives, strategic priorities and managing the legal, operational and compliance risks of the Central Bank in a successful manner during 2019.

18. MACROPRUDENTIAL SURVEILLANCE

Maintaining financial system stability is one of the two statutory objectives of the Central Bank. To achieve this objective, the Central Bank conducts both microprudential supervision and macroprudential surveillance on a continuous basis. Macroprudential Surveillance Department (MSD) conducts a wide range of analysis, some of which complement microprudential supervision, to assess buildup of systemic risk within the financial system of the country. In addition, MSD assesses macro-financial linkages to identify the impact of macroeconomic developments on the domestic financial system and its stability. Macroprudential surveillance is carried out using data reported by regulated financial institutions and data collected by MSD from other sources. The findings of such assessments facilitate the policy formulation process of the Central Bank and also support the introduction of macroprudential policy measures to mitigate systemic risks. A summary of the main activities undertaken by MSD during 2019 is given below:

(a) Macroprudential Surveillance

Macroprudential surveillance was conducted to identify buildup of systemic risks to the financial sector and to assess the resilience of the financial system to such risks. The Surveillance framework covers risks emanating from global and domestic macroeconomic developments, financial market activities and the financial institutions sector. Risk exposures of the financial system were studied both with regard to data collected through the Central Bank regulated financial institutions and from external sources. MSD broadened the macroprudential surveillance framework considerably during 2019 to assess risks posed to the financial sector from developments in both the corporate and household sectors. Data from external sources allowed assessment of exposure of the formal financial sector to the household and non-household sectors. The assessment provides leading indicators of household and non-household sector debt dynamics. With a view to addressing the need for a comprehensive risk assessment on the risks emanating from the corporate sector to financial system stability, MSD initiated the assessment of corporate sector risk profiles. While macroeconomic and financial developments affect corporate sector performance and

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 107

balance sheets, cohesive behavior of corporates or the behavior of systemically important corporates could influence the macro economy and the financial system. In addition, MSD also engaged in an interconnectedness study which identified the contagion risks of the banking sector. In view of the need for monitoring credit quality of the financial system and its evolution over time, MSD employed probability density functions for Non-Performing Loans (NPLs), which indicate the possibility of rising tail risk of deterioration in asset quality to the financial system. MSD constructed a Financial Stress Index during the year to identify periods when strains on the financial system impair its intermediation function. This index combines indicators from the equities market, bond market, foreign exchange market and banking sector into a composite index to assess the degree of stress in the financial system. MSD also continued to compile a number of composite financial system stability indicators based on the stability and soundness of different sub sectors of the domestic financial system while also taking steps to improve the reliability of these indices. In addition to continuation of the banking sector top-down macro stress testing to assess the impact of credit risk, interest rate risk, and foreign exchange risk on the level of capital of the banking system and also individual banks, MSD expanded the scope of stress testing to cover the Licensed Finance Companies sector. MSD submitted a number of papers to the Monetary Board containing risk assessments which allow identification of possible threats to the stability of the financial system, and other contemporary concerns over financial system stability during 2019.

(b) Surveys and Data Collection

Systemic Risk Survey (SRS): MSD continued to conduct the bi-annual Systemic Risk Survey, which was initiated in 2017 with the purpose of identifying market perceptions on the potential risks to financial system stability. Materialisation of these risks could potentially disrupt the financial intermediation process including the orderly functioning of the financial institutions, financial markets and payments system while also affecting public confidence on the financial system stability. The survey results provide early warning signals to foresee systemic risks to the financial system and facilitates prioritisation of actions to be taken to mitigate the emerging risks and formulation of appropriate policy measures. Further, SRS helps to validate the internal assessments of MSD on vulnerabilities of the financial system.

Household Sector Creditworthiness Survey (HHCS): With the purpose of enhancing household sector surveillance, the HHCS was initiated. To expand the coverage of the HHCS and identify risks and vulnerabilities emanating from the household sector and its implications on financial system stability, MSD initiated the tender procedure to outsource the data collection of the survey

to a third party. It is expected that the survey will be completed in 2020.

Data Collection: MSD continued to gather granular level data from several external parties to enrich its database. The department continued to collect data regularly from external institutions such as the Colombo Stock Exchange, Department of Co-operative Development, Department of Labour, Department of Pensions, Employees’ Trust Fund Board, Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka, SANASA Federation, Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka, Credit Information Bureau, Sri Lanka Customs and the Unit Trust Association of Sri Lanka.

(c) Publishing the Financial System Stability Review and Contributing to Statutory Reports and Other Publications of the Central Bank

The Financial System Stability Review (FSSR) 2019: FSSR was published in December 2019 with the purpose of presenting an independent evaluation of risks and vulnerabilities faced by the Sri Lankan financial sector and to present risk mitigation measures adopted. The FSSR 2019 contained five chapters, namely, “Macrofinancial Conditions”; “Financial Markets”; “Financial Institutions”; “Household Sector & Corporate Sector” and “Financial System Infrastructure”. In addition, the report contained a policy box which set out the key policy changes and regulatory actions implemented for the financial sector in 2019, and two informative box articles on the Systemic Risk Survey 2019 and the impact of climate change on financial system stability.

Other Publications: MSD coordinated and compiled the Chapter on “Financial Sector Developments and Stability” of the Central Bank Annual Report 2018 and the “Recent Economic Developments 2019”, published by the Central Bank. Further, the Department contributed to the Chapter on Financial Sector Developments in the September 15th Report which is submitted to the Minister in charge of Finance. These reports provide comprehensive analyses on financial institutions, financial markets and financial infrastructure of the country with particular emphasis on performance, risks and risk management, resource availability and regulatory developments pertaining to each area, together with an assessment of potential implications on the overall financial system stability of the country. The Department also contributed to other publications of the Central Bank by way of compiling financial sector data and providing analysis on subsectors of the financial system.

(d) Coordination of the Committees on Financial System Stability

Financial System Stability Committee (FSSC): MSD serves as the secretariat for the FSSC. FSSC, which is

an interdepartmental forum, was established for the identification of risks affecting the financial sector, discussion of measures to mitigate risks and the co-ordination of efforts to promote financial system stability. Five FSSC meetings were held during 2019. MSD presented its Risk Assessment reports to the FSSC to obtain the views of the participants before submitting them to the Monetary Board.

Financial System Stability Consultative Committee (FSSCC): The FSSCC provides views and advice to the Central Bank on financial sector issues. It consists of key personnel from external sector institutes in the Sri Lankan financial system. These personnel are appointed by the Governor and the current FSSCC comprises of seventeen members. Five FSSCC meetings were held during the year. MSD provides the secretarial services to the FSSCC.

(e) Capacity Development via Technical Assistance from the IMF

The Technical Assistance (TA) project financed by the Financial Sector Stability Fund (FSSF): This project aims to support the Central Bank to strengthen its capacity in bolstering financial institutions’ resilience to financial risks and shocks. The Road Map for the TA mission, which was finalised during 2019, identifies the following objectives: broaden the macroprudential framework, strengthen capacity development for the stress testing functionality and improvement in studies relating to financial market infrastructure. It is expected that the TA mission would commence during 2020. MSD is the key contact point of the IMF with regard to this TA mission and is involved in coordinating with other relevant departments of the Central Bank.

21.4 Maintenance of the Registry in Government Securities

Facility for real-time updates in the Title Registry of government securities in the CDS, which is maintained at the PDD, has ensured safekeeping of government securities. Periodic statements to CDS account holders on their holdings, transactions and payments were sent continuously throughout

the year. PDD sent 1,551 statements in electronic form and 14,113 semi-annual statements of holdings, 38,467 monthly statements of transactions and 16,184 payment statements by post to CDS account holders during 2019. As at end-December 2019, there were 93,911 registered CDS account holders. In addition, CDS account holders are provided with the facility to view account details online, among other facilities introduced to enhance the safety features of government securities investments.

21.5 System Reforms

In order to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness and transparency with the purpose of developing the government securities market, the following system reforms were undertaken during the year 2019:

(a) Implementation of the Active Liability Management Framework

The Parliament has approved the Active Liability Management Act (ALMA) in March 2018. Accordingly, a resolution was passed by the Parliament in July 2019 to raise up to Rs. 480 billion for liability management purposes under the ALMA. The liability management initiatives enable the government to proactively address part of the future refinancing requirements ahead of time by reducing rollover peaks and extending the maturity duration and/or smoothening repayments structure of ISBs and other debt maturities. In general, liability management will help the government to diversify the investor base, provide opportunities to streamline the cost of borrowing based on market conditions, extend the duration of the liability portfolio, reduce refinancing risk in the near term and create a favourable price tension for any new issuances. In this regard, PDD initiated raising funds and building required buffers in the domestic market by executing its first liability management based T-bonds issuance amounting to Rs. 15 billion in October 2019 and another Rs. 15 billion in December 2019. The buffers built in 2019 are expected to be utilised for settlement of debt service obligations during the early part of 2020. The government also initiated preliminary work with respect to accessing alternative Sovereign bond markets in the latter part of 2019.

(b) Formulation and Implementation of Medium Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS) for 2019-2023

The Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MoFP) jointly developed a Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS) for the country and published the same on the Central Bank website in April 2019. This strategy would facilitate to raise funds required to meet the cash flow needs of the Government in an appropriate composition, to ensure that the Government’s financing needs are met at the

lowest possible cost with a prudent level of risk. The MTDS, which initially covers the period 2019 – 2023, is mainly focused on containing the foreign currency debt exposure in line with the end-2018 level, improving the Average Time to Maturity (ATM) of the foreign currency debt portfolio and minimising the debt maturing within one year. The Central Bank and the Government made improvements in all debt dynamics referred in MTDS in 2019, particularly that of foreign currency ATM and debt maturing within 1 year period.

(c) Real-time SMS or/and e-mail Notification to the Customers Registered in the Central Depository System of LankaSecure

The delivery of real-time notifications for each and every debit and credit record of scripless securities in the LankaSecure System, carried out for each Securities Account by way of an SMS or/and e-mail alert to the Customers of the LankaSecure System, was implemented on 25th March 2019.

(d) Enhancing the Predictability and Transparency of the Primary Auction Process

The scope of the quarterly rolling auction calendar was further extended to cover a period of six months during 2019 where an advanced T-bond and T-bill auction calendar covering the period from July to December 2019 was published concurrent to the Ministry of Finance in view of further enhancing the predictability and transparency of the primary auction process of government securities.

21.6 Way forward

(a) Explore the possibility of extending the new primary issuance system for T- bills and an electronic bidding arrangement for primary issuances of SLDBs to further improve transparency and efficiency of government borrowings from the domestic market. Further enhance the market based arrangements of the new primary issuance system for T-bonds and applicability in market participants in T-bond subscriptions.

(b) Regulations and Directions under the Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance (RSSO) and Local Treasury Bills Ordinance (LTBO) are being currently reviewed with a view to implement prudential legislations in government securities market for which necessary amendments have been proposed.

(c) To enhance the transparency in conducting government securities transactions in the secondary market, a circular has been issued to all participants of the LankaSettle system on 01 October 2019 to input key attributes such as settlement value, price and interest rate of each and every transaction with effect from 01 January 2020.

(d) To broaden and deepen the government securities transactions in the secondary market, the preliminary

Part II - 113

measures have been taken and progress has been made during 2019 to setup a distinct Electronic Trading Platform (ETP), a Central Counterparty (CCP) arrangement for government securities and an upgraded Central Securities Depository (CSD) along with required legal reforms.

21.7 Coordinating Sovereign Rating Review Missions and International Sovereign Bond Issuances

In 2019, the PDD facilitated international rating agencies (Fitch Ratings Ltd., Moody’s Investor Services, Standard & Poor’s) for their annual rating reviews in order to ensure the availability of international sovereign ratings for Sri Lanka.

During the year, two ISBs were successfully issued. In March 2019, US Dollar 1 billion of 5-year maturity at 6.85 per cent and US Dollar 1.4 billion of 10-year maturity at 7.85 per cent were issued while in June 2019, US Dollar 0.5 billion of 5-year maturity at 6.35 per cent and US Dollar 1.5 billion of long 10-year maturity at 7.55 per cent were issued in line with the financing initiatives.

22. REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT

In 2019, Regional Development Department (RDD) focused on developing and implementing new policy strategies related to development finance initiatives while further expanding its functions of carrying out conventional concessionary credit operations. These new policy strategies and actions strengthened the capacity of RDD and the Central Bank as a whole to promote financial inclusiveness in the country in support of achieving inclusive and stable financial system and balanced equitable economic growth.

During 2019, RDD continued to coordinate, facilitate and implement various refinance, interest subsidy and credit guarantee schemes funded by the government, the Central Bank, Donor Agencies and Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs). These schemes mainly targeted the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and individuals scattered across the country, who are in need of affordable financial facilities to enhance their business ventures. The beneficiaries of these schemes represented all sectors of the economy i.e., Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, Industry and Services. Further, RDD provided a range of credit supplementary services, which helped increase the financial inclusion and promote the entrepreneurship skills among the vulnerable groups in the economy. These efforts included conducting island-wide financial literacy and skill development programmes throughout the year. In addition, RDD utilised print and electronic media were effectively utilised by RDD in the efforts of conducting comprehensive, island-wide awareness building programmes to increase the level of financial literacy and entrepreneurship development.

From the policy perspective, the year 2019 was a challenging, yet successful for RDD as major policy changes, which were required to improve the financial inclusion in the country, were finalised and prepared to be implemented from 2020

onwards. Further, several actions were initiated to introduce new schemes to address the changing needs of the target groups.

22.1 Providing Concessionary Financial Facilities

RDD continued its credit operations by implementing 10 refinance, interest subsidy and credit guarantee schemes, increasing the financial outreach in 2019 under three main funding sources i.e government, the Central Bank and Donor Agencies. Summary of the schemes implemented by RDD during 2019 are given in Table II – 29.

As at end 2019, RDD has disbursed loans, through the PFIs, amounting to Rs. 15,320 million among 104,238 beneficiaries under 8 refinance and 2 interest subsidy schemes enabling those beneficiaries to meet the challenges ahead with solid financial foundation and high self-reliance. Interest subsidy schemes played a major role by disbursing around 68 per cent of the loans while the remainder was disbursed through refinance schemes. The amount of loans disbursed by the government, the Central Bank and donor funded schemes implemented by RDD during 2019, accounted for 72.0 per cent, 23.6 per cent and 4.4 per cent of the total value of loans disbursed, respectively.

Status of the loan schemes implemented by RDD in 2019 and the new developments with regard to these loan schemes, are given below.

22.1.1 Implementation of Government Funded Schemes

The government continued to fund five schemes consisting of four refinance schemes and one interest subsidy scheme by contributing Rs. 11,034 million, i.e. 72.0 per cent of the total loan disbursements, during 2019 serving 96,220 beneficiaries.

(a) Continuing its significant performance, “Sarusara”- New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS) provided interest subsidy for 86,301 small-scale farmers under 33 short-term crop varieties. NCRCS which serves as an interest subsidy scheme and a credit guarantee scheme, accounted for 67.7 per cent of the total disbursements and 94.0 per cent of the disbursements of the government funded schemes during 2019. It is pertinent to note that while the government provided Rs. 224 million worth of interest subsidy under the NCRCS, total loans worth of Rs. 10,370 million were provided by the Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) out of their own funds demarcating a significant commitment towards the agricultural sector development of the country.

(b) Anuradhapura District, which lagged behind the loan disbursement performance of Ampara District in 2018 despite its previously leading record, once again aced the loan distribution under the NCRCS in 2019. Loans disbursed to the beneficiaries of Anuradhapura District amounted to 13.1 per cent (Rs. 1,360 million), while the

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2019

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II

beneficiaries of the Ampara District received 12.3 per cent (Rs. 1,277 million) of the NCRCS as the second highest performing district. This performance was followed by Polonnaruwa District i.e. 10.8 per cent (Rs. 1,124 million) of the scheme.

(c) Further, RDD implemented 4 other refinance loan schemes, namely, Poverty Alleviation Microfinance Project – Revolving Fund (PAMP-RF), Self-Employment Promotion Initiative Loan Scheme - Phase II (SEPI – Phase II), Swashakthi Loan Scheme and Athwela Loan Scheme. These schemes were designed and implemented to achieve the broader objectives of poverty alleviation, entrepreneurship development, employment generation and revival of disaster affected economic activities, respectively.

(d) In order to support the smallholder farmers who are engaged in tea replanting and rubber new planting activities, the Smallholder Tea and Rubber Revitalisation (STaRR) Interest Subsidy Scheme was designed during 2019, in collaboration with the Ministry of Plantation Industries and Export Agriculture (MPIEA) and the Project

Management Unit (PMU) of the STaRR project. The STaRR Interest subsidy scheme is expected to provide concessionary loans to tea and rubber smallholder farmers to establish self-employment or short-term income generating activities, until such time the production is generated from their new plantations.

(e) While the STaRR Project is funded by the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD), the STaRR Interest Subsidy Scheme implemented by the Central Bank is funded by the government. In this regard, RDD made arrangements to sign the Administrative Agreement between the government and the Central Bank. The Operating Instructions to PFIs of the STaRR Interest Subsidy Scheme were issued accordingly. The operations of the interest subsidy scheme is expected to comence in the first quarter of 2020 in colloboration with the MPIEA and the PMU of STaRR project.

(f) Further, the Administrative Agreement was signed with the government to implement a new Credit Guarantee Scheme to provide government guarantees through the Central Bank, to the PFIs for the loans granted under

(g) In addition, blue prints have been developed to introduce a new government funded refinance loan scheme for development financing and small and medium scale enterprises during 2019 to cater the fund requirements of long term development projects, small and medium scale enterprises and working capital requirements of export oriented enterprises in Sri Lanka.

(h) In order to provide adequate financial support for the emerging young entrepreneurs to meet initial capital requirements, the total allocated amount of Rs. 390 million was increased to Rs. 950 million under SEPI – Phase II scheme whilst increasing the maximum loan amount from Rs. 500,000 to Rs. 1,000,000 per borrower.

(i) A new Credit Guarantee Scheme was designed for the Working Capital Loans to be granted to the Small and Medium Scale Entrepreneurs whose previous loans are currently in the Non- Performing Loan category under the scheme on credit support to accelerate economic growth.

22.1.2 Implementation of Central Bank Funded Schemes

With a view to broadening the financial outreach of the MSMEs in Sri Lanka, the Central Bank continued to fund two main schemes, namely, the “Saubagya – (The Prosperity)” Loan Scheme (SLS) and the Commercial Scale Dairy Development Loan Scheme (CSDDLS) where SLS is a refinance scheme and CSDDLS is an interest subsidy scheme.

(a) SLS continued to be the most demanded and popular refinance scheme amongst the schemes implemented by the Central Bank. As at end 2019, loans worth of Rs. 3,576 million among the beneficiaries were disbursed under the SLS.

(b) Following the adverse impact on the tourism industry due to the Easter Sunday attacks in 2019 incident, RDD made arrangements to grant moratorium for the loans granted for the tourism sector under the SLS in terms of the Circular No. 07 of 2019 issued by Bank Supervision Department (BSD) of the Central Bank dated 08 May 2019, which requested the licensed banks to grant moratorium for performing loans given to individuals and entities in Tourism Industry on a case-by-case basis.

(c) Interest subsidy under the CSDDLS was provided to PFIs by the Central Bank for the loans granted to the dairy

farmers covering all activities related to dairy supporting the national objective of achieving self-sufficiency in terms of milk.

22.1.3 Implementation of Donor Funded Schemes

(a) The donor funded component of the Smallholder Agribusiness Partnerships Programme (SAPP) continued its operations during 2019. This component funded by the IFAD, included Public-Private-Producer-Partnership (4P) Capital, 4P Seasonal and Youth Loan Schemes. These schemes disbursed Rs. 672 million among 3,251 beneficiaries during 2019. The donor funded schemes accounted for 4.4 per cent of total disbursements made through the schemes implemented by the Central Bank.

(b) In order to cater to the changing requirements of the beneficiaries of the agricultural and other related sectors, a major restructuring was carried out with regard to the credit component of the SAPP in collaboration with the Project Management Unit of the SAPP. The purpose of this restructuring was to simplify the credit operations of both the government funded and donor funded components of SAPP and to enhance the operational efficiency by introducing simpler credit component and to deliver better service to the beneficiaries. With the restructuring, which entailed extensive policy amendments, arrangements have been made to cease the operations of existing SAPP loan schemes and to introduce new loan schemes with more market friendly and flexible features. The new credit component of SAPP includes two 4P loan schemes (i.e., 4P Agribusiness and 4P Youth Loan Schemes)

In the policy front, actions were taken to sign the second addendum to the Administrative Agreement of SAPP with the government and issue the new Operating Instructions enabling the operations of new SAPP Loan schemes.

22.2. Strategic Initiatives of RDD

In the policy perspective, the RDD took a number of new policy directions to strengthen efforts in achieving balanced and inclusive economic growth during 2019.

22.2.1 Development of the First National Financial Inclusion Strategy in Sri Lanka

In the recent past, financial inclusion efforts of the Central Bank have taken significant strategic turnaround with RDD playing a leading role with its financial inclusion efforts. Financial Inclusion has been identified as a main focus area in the “Sustainable Development Road Map” launched by the Central Bank in 2019, while the first National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) of Sri Lanka is expected to launch in early 2020. Implementation of the NFIS primarily involves, inter alia, establishing a National-level Coordination and Implementing Mechanism for the NFIS accompanying a NFIS Secretariat, capacity building of the Financial institutions to design and develop sustainable products for MSMEs.

The NFIS was developed primarily by RDD with the support of the other stakeholders including several other departments of the Central Bank with the technical and financial assistance from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group (WBG). The Vision of the NFIS is “Better Quality Inclusion for Better Lives” which focuses on upgrading the lives of Sri Lankans through increasing financial inclusion.

The 3rd consultative mission with regard to the development of the NFIS was successfully conducted in August 2019 and by fulfilling the major objective of the mission, stakeholders were able to finalise the NFIS. During the extensive consultative process of the NFIS, the policy pillars for the strategy have been identified as (I) Digital Finance and Payments, (II) MSME Finance, (III) Consumer Protection and (IV) Financial Literacy and Capacity Building. Further, (I) Data, (II) Infrastructure and (III) Policy, Regulation and Supervision has been identified as key enablers of the NFIS.

It is pertinent to note that, financial education has been highlighted as a key catalyst in the whole process of financial inclusion and hence, it has been given priority to implement actions relating to this area more intensively under the NFIS while introducing a new component as “Improving Consumer

Empowerment via Financial Education”. In this regard, the Central Bank recommended to the Ministry of Education to include the subject of financial literacy to the National Education Curriculum with modern teaching materials, tools and techniques in a more dynamic manner.

The Central Bank also conducted an island-wide Financial Inclusion Survey (FIS) with the assistance of the IFC. This survey was expected to fulfill the data and information lacuna which hinders the efforts to provide a general landscape for financial inclusion levels. The outcome of FIS was used as the baseline information in developing the NFIS for Sri Lanka and setting up targets in a forward-looking strategy framework. The outcome of the survey will be published in early 2020 in line with the launching of the NFIS.

Moving forward with its financial inclusion efforts, RDD expects to conduct the first ever Financial Literacy Survey for Sri Lanka in 2020 with the technical assistance of the IFC. This will enable RDD to introduce a financial education mapping initiative for Sri Lanka to identify any gaps, lessons learnt, duplication of efforts and potential for synergies of financial education in the Sri Lankan context. Further, it is expected to establish a strong coordination mechanism to coordinate financial literacy programmes while developing a common set of definitions for financial literacy and develop key competencies frameworks with the participation of key stakeholders.

22.2.2 Continuing the Membership with the Alliance of Financial Inclusion (AFI)

RDD has taken actions to continue the membership of the Central Bank with the Alliance of Financial Inclusion (AFI) during 2019. The annual membership of AFI provided varieties of opportunities for its member institutions including the Central Bank, to upgrade their knowledge and skills which have positive impact on financial inclusion efforts, either directly or indirectly, undertaken by the Central Bank.

Apart from carrying out an administrative role with regard to the relationship maintenance and acting as the focal point of communication of the AFI, RDD, among other departments of the Central Bank who work in collaboration with AFI, has consistently been an active player and contributor to AFI, through its continuous participation in various activities of the AFI network. During 2019, RDD actively participated in the Working Group meetings and sharing its technical knowledge with the AFI member countries while sharing experiences with AFI member institutions through providing expertise as panel members and resource persons. Further, RDD officers who engaged in financial inclusion activities participated in the Global Policy Forum 2019 held in Kigali, Rwanda, which annually gathers AFI members and external stakeholders from the standard setting bodies, the private sector, and the academia, to discuss collaborative ways to increase access to financial services and to advance the financial inclusion agenda globally. Further, opportunities exist to enhance the global voice of the member countries through AFI’s unique global voice platform through the Maya Commitment

Declaration (MCD). This also serves as a platform to increase the visibility of financial inclusion efforts and expertise of the member to the global network.

22.2.3 Hosting 32nd Annual Conference of the Asian Credit Supplementation Institution Confederation (ACSIC)

In October 2019, the Central Bank hosted the 32nd Annual Conference of the Asian Credit Supplementation Institution Confederation (ACSIC) in Colombo under the theme of “Credit Supplementation: Towards Sustainable Development”. ACSIC is the largest Asian Corporative body for the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) established in 1987 with the objective of promoting and developing sound credit supplementation systems. The ACSIC consists 16 member institutions from 11 countries. Where the current member countries are India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Taiwan and Thailand.

The Conference was comprised of technical sessions attending 90 participants including foreign delegates, for two days. It served as an opportunity for knowledge sharing on credit supplementation and paved the way to deepen relationships among members, while creating a positive image of Sri Lanka among member nations.

22.2.4 Automating the Operations of the Loan Schemes Implemented by RDD

RDD initiated actions to automate the operations of loan schemes implemented by the Central Bank commencing with the SAPP loan schemes. The project is funded by the government under the Institutional Strengthening Component of the SAPP, Financing Agreement between the government and IFAD. The project is expected to provide separate user interfaces for the SAPP stakeholders including the Central Bank, the PMU of SAPP, PFIs and private companies involved in 4P arrangements. During 2019, a suitable vendor to develop the software for the automation project was selected. The project is expected to complete during the first half of 2020.

Further, with the intention of increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the loan operations by decreasing redundant work involved in the implementation of concessionary refinance schemes and also to move towards a paperless and green approach, actions are expected to be initiated in 2020 to develop a new IT application for Interest subsidy loan schemes and Credit Guarantee schemes implemented by RDD.

22.3 Skills Development and Capacity Building

Identifying the importance of financial literacy and awareness as dynamic parts of the journey towards the comprehensive financial inclusion, RDD conducted 122 awareness programmes covering all areas of the country. These programmes mainly focused on the financial literacy, entrepreneurship development and skills development etc.

to educate community leaders and other stakeholders, who are involved in social mobilising activities and financially excluded groups at the grass root level of the society.

23. REGIONAL OFFICE MANAGEMENT

In terms of Section 7 of the MLA, “the Central Bank shall have its principal place of business in Colombo and may have such branches, agencies and correspondents in other places in Sri Lanka or abroad as may be necessary for the proper conduct of business of the Bank.” Accordingly, starting from 1981, the Central Bank took steps to establish seven Regional Offices (ROO) in the districts of Matara, Anuradhapura, Matale, Jaffna, Trincomalee, Kilinochchi and Nuwara Eliya with the view of carrying out the Central Bank functions and promoting the development activities of respective regions. RO Jaffna was amalgamated with RO Kilinochchi in June 2017 in order to provide effective services to people in the region with the use of resources and facilities available at RO Kilinochchi. Currently, functions of ROMD and ROO cover all 25 administrative districts in the country.

ROO and ROMD contribute to achieve sustainable and balanced regional development by promoting development activities while conducting various awareness and training programmes and arranging trade fairs, technology transfer workshops and exposure visits for the benefit of entrepreneurs. Moreover, ROMD and ROO also play a major role in extending Central Bank services at the regional level.

23.1 Development Activities

During the year, 139 awareness programmes on formal and affordable financial services were conducted by ROMD and ROO targeting 15,267 beneficiaries island-wide including entrepreneurs, government officials, students and the general public. Further, ROO promoted the credit delivery mechanism of the respective regions while establishing 1,467 credit links and provided credit counseling services to borrowers who faced difficulties in repayments of their loan installments due to various reasons. Additionally, 15 knowledge sharing programmes on indebtedness were also conducted targeting 1,724 beneficiaries.

ROMD and ROO conducted training programmes covering the areas of entrepreneurship development, setting-up SMEs, skills development, technology transfers and application of best practices in businesses. Accordingly, 83 training programmes on areas such as preparation of business

Meanwhile, several initiatives were taken to develop the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector during the year 2019. Attention was paid to identify and develop a potential specific economic sector in each region by providing training and arranging credit facilities for relevant entrepreneurs. Accordingly, 38 programmes were conducted targeting 2,145 individuals involved in footwear manufacturing, beauty culture, floriculture production, handicraft making, dairy farming and gem and jewelry industry.

Further, ROMD and ROO conducted 32 training programmes to promote the MSME sector in the country through development officers attached to certain divisional secretariats throughout the country. Accordingly, 2,974 development officers were trained with the intention of making use of their services as change agents to promote SMEs in the respective regions.

ROO conducted 06 business clinics during the year and provided business counselling for 515 MSMEs with the intention of inculcating latest business knowledge and converting those enterprises into more organised entities. In addition, another 22 special programmes on quality management, consumer protection and safety procedures, import and export regulations were conducted and accordingly, 968 individuals benefited through those programmes. Region-wise entrepreneur societies were also established to support 222 entrepreneurs.

23.2. Representing the Central Bank at Regional Level

ROO and ROMD facilitated the conduct of various programmes related to other departments of the Central Bank in the regions. ROO attended to 101,366 EPF inquiries, maintained sales counters for commemorative coins and the Central Bank publications, supervised country wide data collection centers and currency museums set-up at RO Matara and RO Anuradhapura throughout the year. Further, several programmes were also conducted on subjects such as clean note policy, identification of forged notes, unauthorised financial institutions, prohibited

schemes, government securities market, anti-money laundering and countering terrorist financing, payment and settlement systems and foreign exchange regulations. In addition, educational programmes were arranged in order to upgrade the knowledge of students and teachers. Accordingly, 103 awareness programmes on different subjects were conducted with the participation of 22,001 persons. During January 2019, ROO facilitated the conduct of the preliminary written examination of the Econ Icon Season IV quiz programme of the Central Bank in their respective regions. Moreover, ROMD and ROO engaged in conducting surveys on topics such as credit demand, awareness on customer charter and financial inclusiveness during the year 2019. Regional Managers, other officers of ROO and ROMD attended meetings, discussions and special events arranged at regional levels.

24. Resolution and Enforcement

Pursuant to the decision taken at the Monetary Board at its meeting No. 21/2017 held on 16 June 2017, Resolution and Enforcement Department (RED) was established on 01 January 2018 by transforming the Enforcement Unit operated within the Legal and Compliance Department (LCD). The Deposit Insurance Unit, which operated within Bank Supervision Department, was also transferred to RED.

The main objectives of RED are resolving distressed financial institutions, conducting special investigations against officials of institutions who have acted in contravention of provisions of relevant regulations in laws of the Banking Act and Finance Business Act including prohibited schemes and unauthorised deposit taking entities etc. RED consists of five (05) divisions, namely, Resolution, Enforcement and Prosecution, Special Investigations, Deposit Insurance and Administration based on the following core functions assigned to the department:

24.1. Resolution of Distressed Financial Institutions

The Resolution and Enforcement Department is in the process of developing a comprehensive resolution framework to include resolution mechanisms for all entities supervised by the Central Bank with clear legal empowerments. It will be initially developed within the existing regulatory framework in which the resolution authority and its resolution powers are specified. At present almost all resolution powers are vested with the relevant regulators, i.e. Director of Bank Supervision (DBS) (in the case of licensed banks) and Director of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions (D/SNBFI) (in the case of non-bank financial institutions), as per the relevant legal enactments.

including internal arrangements in terms of the prevailing legal provisions. Accordingly, to conduct investigations on unauthorised finance businesses, D/SNBFI authorises officers of the RED under Section 42(1) of the Finance Business Act No.42 of 2011 and to conduct investigations on prohibited schemes, the Governor appoints officers of RED under Section 83C of the Banking Act No.30 of 1988.

The officers of RED initiated four (04) investigations on the conduct of alleged prohibited schemes. Reports of two (02) investigations along with the determination of the Monetary Board were submitted to the Attorney General Department for prosecution. Further, officers of RED assisted Criminal Investigation Division (CID) and Financial Criminal Investigation Division for another two investigations on prohibited schemes and the completed investigation reports were sent to the Attorney General’s Department for further proceedings.

RED concluded an investigation on an unauthorised deposit taking institution and initiated legal action as the directors of the company failed to comply with the determination and directions of the Monetary Board. One director of the company was taken into police custody and the courts directed the CID to conduct further investigation.

As a preventive measure, the Enforcement and Prosecution Division conducts awareness programmes island-wide on a regular basis to enhance financial literacy among rural communities on prohibited schemes and unauthorised deposit taking institutions. RED conducted twenty six (26) awareness programmes for government officers, school students, and officers of security forces during the year 2019.

25. RISK MANAGEMENT

The Central Bank faces various risks, both financial and non-financial in nature in pursuing its policy objectives. Since the materialisation of any of these risks could have a severe impact on the financial position and the reputation of the Central Bank, a properly designed risk management framework is vital for the Central Bank.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2019

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 120

Part II

In line with the new risk management framework, Risk Management Department (RMD) developed a Risk Management Policy Statement (RMPS) for the Central Bank, setting out the policies for implementation of risk management across the Central Bank. In this process, the Central Bank follows accepted standards and guidelines for managing risks, while assigning risk ownership and management among different stakeholders with clear accountability.

25.1 Non-Financial Risk

RMD conducts an annual survey among the management of the Central Bank to determine the top bank-wide operational risks impacting the Central Bank. The survey results are used to revise the Operational Risk Taxonomy of the Central Bank, which helps prioritise key operational risk categories impacting the institution and requiring the attention of the Management.

To promote a risk culture within the bank, RMD conducts numerous risk awareness sessions for the Central Bank staff throughout the year at various fora, with the involvement of RMD staff and external resource personnel as required.

With a view to strengthening the operational risk management function, RMD worked closely with the World Bank’s Operational Risk Team in 2019, and the existing risk governance structure and the framework for managing operational risks were reviewed. The World Bank assisted in finalising the operational risk taxonomy, risk rating scales and specific steps related to identification, assessment, monitoring and reporting of non-financial risks. Also, they conducted an operational risk assessment over two selected pilot areas of the Central Bank and delivered training on operational risk management for all key staff members.

RMD worked with other departments to facilitate the development of Risk Registers and to refine these Risk Registers in a phased-out manner using an Excel-based risk register format. Once this process is completed, the Management will be able to make more informed, risk conscious decisions on departmental activities.

RMD with the assistance of ITD deployed an automated Incident Reporting System on 01 October 2019, which is accessible to staff at all levels of the Central Bank. This system is expected to encourage reporting of incidents and to facilitate the development of a central repository of incidents while tracking progress on the implementation of corrective actions, identifying possible trends and areas of vulnerabilities and improving risk reduction measures.

25.2 Financial Risk

As the second line of defense, RMD independently monitors, analyses, evaluates, and reports financial risks and ensures compliance with the Monetary Board approved investment policies and guidelines relating to International Reserves (IR), Internal Investment Funds (IIF) of the Central Bank and Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), which is carried out as an agency function for the Government.

RMD reviewed Strategic Assets Allocations (SAAs) and Investment Policy Statements (IPSs) for IR, IIF and EPF during 2019. Further, RMD began reviewing the Investment Guidelines (IG) for those funds by setting all the necessary risk parameters. RMD continuously monitors market risks and credit risks by frequent analysis of the risk indicators. In addition to the above, RMD regularly monitors adherence to limit frameworks given in SAAs, IPSs, IGs and Counterparty Credit Risk Management Guidelines (CCRMG) for IR, IIF and EPF. All these risk assessments and non-compliances are presented to the monthly Investment Oversight Committees (IOCs), such as International Reserve Investment Oversight Committee (IRIOC), Internal Investment Oversight Committee (IIOC) and Employees’ Provident Fund Investment Oversight Committee (EIOC). Further, BROC reviews the main risk factors and non-compliances which were highlighted at the IOCs, in addition to recommending the relevant policies and guidelines for the approval of the Monetary Board. The highlighted risks/ changes to risk parameters and non-compliances are reported to the Monetary Board on a quarterly basis.

26. SECRETARIAT

Secretariat Department (SD) is one of the first departments established at the inception of the Central Bank. The main functions of SD involve overall corporate administration of the Central Bank, procurement management, administration of superannuation funds, facilitating overseas studies and training, conducting the Board of Survey for disposal management, and providing secretarial and protocol assistance to the Governor.

28. STAFF SERVICES MANAGEMENT

Staff Services Management Department (SSMD) continued to extend welfare facilities to all beneficiaries in an efficient and effective manner throughout the year. These welfare facilities included provision of loans under the Staff Housing (Mortgage) Loan Scheme, Provident Fund Loan Scheme and Staff Benefit Scheme; reimbursement of expenses under the Employer Contributory Medical Benefit Scheme (MBS) and provision of medical and restaurant facilities. The number of registered beneficiaries under MBS consisting of employees, pensioners, their registered dependants together with widows/widowers was approximately 10,700 as at end 2019.

During 2019, SSMD granted 1,748 loans which included Housing Loans (273), Provident Fund Loans (1014), Vehicle Loans (197), Computer Loans (03), Cat D Loans (73) and Cat B Loans (188) under the Staff Benefit Scheme. The loan monitoring system enabled effective supervision of loan disbursements to employees.

Having considered the escalation of market price of real estate and increase in the cost of construction, the quantum of loan granted for housing loans was increased up to Rs.7,500,000 with effect from 01.03.2019. Accordingly, amounts granted for repairs and extensions of existing houses were also increased.

In order to streamline the operations of the restaurant of the Central Bank while enhancing the productivity and improving the cost efficiency of the services to the staff, restaurant facilities were outsourced with effect from 01 September 2019.

SSMD continued to reimburse medical expenses incurred by all registered beneficiaries under the MBS. The total amount of reimbursement of medical expenditure increased by 12 per cent in 2019 compared to the previous year. With the approval of the Monetary Board, the reimbursement limits of medical expenditure under MBS were increased with effect from 01.03.2019. SSMD continued to provide facilities of the medical centre to the Bank employees during office hours throughout the year through outsourced service providers. Medical tests and laboratory services were also provided at the Medical Centre at a reasonable charge. During the year, SSMD conducted four awareness programmes, namely, “Reduce Prostate Gland Related Risks”, “How to Lead a Healthy Life in the Modern World”, “Myths and Beliefs of Food Nutrition” and “Work Life and Stress Balance” to enhance the knowledge of the Central Bank staff on such important health issues.

29. STATISTICS

Statistics Department (STD) effectively continued its operations, contributing towards the achievement of the Central Bank’s objectives of ‘maintaining economic and price stability’ and ‘maintaining financial system stability’.

Accordingly, the major activities that were performed by the Department during 2019 included: collection of data and information from primary and secondary sources; compilation of business sentiment, property price and wage rate indices; forecasting short term inflation and Gross Domestic Product (GDP); compilation of regional statistics namely, Sri Lanka Prosperity Index (SLPI) and Provincial Gross Domestic Product (PGDP); timely and regular dissemination of information through data library, publications, reports and press releases and engaging in knowledge sharing activities.

The year 2019 marked a step forward in the Department’s efforts to explore the use of advanced technologies relating to big data, machine learning and data visualisation, to improve and complement the traditional approaches, in line with many other central banks around the globe. Internet data, which is one of the sources of big data, was used in compiling some of the useful indices during the year. Accordingly, prices available in property websites were used in compiling property price indices and the price data available on supermarket websites were used in compiling the supermarket imported price index to examine the exchange rate passthrough on imported items. In improving the inflation forecasts further, the Department experimented with employing machine learning techniques. In addition, the use of interactive dashboards, which enables gleaning insights easily, when communicating statistical analyses, was also initiated during the year.

29.1 Collecting Data through Surveys and Other Data Sources

(a) Business Surveys

The Business Outlook Survey (BOS), which provides a snapshot of business sentiments regarding the existing and expected developments related to key indicators of the economic activities, was continued on a quarterly basis during 2019 to monitor the short-term economic developments. The target population of this survey was large scale enterprises, which were involved in all major activities of the economy, namely, agriculture, industry and services.

The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) Surveys for Manufacturing, Services and Construction activities, which are considered high frequency and timely indicators of economic activities, were conducted on a monthly basis to be used as early indicators in GDP forecasting. The target population of PMI Surveys for Manufacturing and Services was large enterprises predominantly concentrated in the Western province. The survey for the Construction industry covered major construction firms selected from the companies registered with the Construction Industry Development Authority (CIDA). These indices could also be used by researchers, economic analysts, industry experts and business decision-makers to better understand the economic condition of the country.

Part II - 123

Credit Conditions Surveys, which are designed to capture the demand and supply side developments in the credit market, were continued during the year 2019. With regard to the Credit Demand Survey, the target population was from the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) of the economy in the Western province and the provinces where the Central Bank has its regional presence. The survey was conducted on a semi-annual basis and the results were reported to be used in policy decision making process. The Credit Supply Survey, which was designed to capture the recent developments and forward-looking information on the credit market, covered all licensed commercial banks and licensed specialised banks in the country. During 2019, the survey was restructured and conducted on a quarterly basis. The results facilitated technical analyses relating to the monetary policy and financial system stability policy formulation process of the Central Bank. Further, the survey findings were published on the Central Bank website for the benefit of external users.

To capture the developments in the retail sector, two separate surveys were conducted by the Department covering general sales outlets and the supermarket segment. The Retail Sales Volume Survey (RSVS) was initiated in 2019 targeting the retail sales outlets covered by the Country Wide Data Collection System (CWDCS), to develop an indicator to capture the volume information related to the general retail trade activities. The Super Market Retail Trade Survey, which was designed to capture the trends in the modern retail trade activities was continued on a quarterly basis during 2019, and the quarterly supermarket cost of sales index was computed using the data collected through this survey.

The Condominium Market Survey was continued on a quarterly basis during 2019 to obtain source data on condominium market in Sri Lanka with a view of monitoring the developments of the sector. The survey was conducted covering major condominium developers to gather information on actual sales prices, demand, reasons for price changes, number of existing and upcoming housing units, level of occupancy in projects and buyer portfolio details. In addition to these, forward-looking perceptions were also obtained. This survey provided information for the policy decision making process.

(b) Inflation Expectations Survey (IES)

The IES was conducted on a monthly basis to gather data and information about current and future expectations on inflation from selected categories of economic agents i.e. Corporate Sector and Household Sector. During 2019, the coverage of the Household Sector IES was expanded to the national level via the CWDCS network. The awareness sessions that were conducted while carrying out these surveys contributed towards bridging

awareness gaps on inflation and better anchoring agents’ expectations on inflation.

(c) Country Wide Data Collection System (CWDCS)

Operations of the CWDCS, the electronic data collection platform introduced in 2018, were continued during 2019 with the engagement of 53 Teacher Investigators (TIs) to collect retail prices of an identical basket of goods to that of the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI); producer prices of agricultural commodities and building materials; daily wages of the informal sector workers; inflation expectations; and retail sales volumes of selected categories of goods, thereby enabling the Central Bank to provide timely inputs for in-house policy making process. With the view of improving the quality of data received through the CWDCS, STD conducted on-site and off-site supervisions with the help of Regional Offices of the Central Bank to identify the data outliers and inconsistencies and to take necessary corrective measures as and when required. STD conducted three regional seminars during 2019 to make the TIs aware of their common mistakes and to discuss solutions for the issues faced by TIs during the data collection process. Moreover, an e-communication platform was also introduced in 2019 to provide solutions to the issues faced by TIs during the process of data collection.

The data/information collected on weekly, monthly and quarterly bases during the year was used in forecasting price movements and inflation; evaluating the impact of policy changes on prices; analysing seasonal variations and regional differences in prices and wages; compiling PGDP and SLPI; and in forecasting GDP.

Moreover, the services of non-teacher data investigators were also obtained through the CWDCS to gather data/information on wholesale and retail prices from the Pettah market, Maradagahamula rice market, Dambulla and Narahenpita Special Economic Centres and Negombo and Peliyagoda Fish markets on daily and weekly bases. The Department collects this information from key markets to strengthen the management information system on the price movements of essential food items and for forecasting purposes. Further, having analysed, these price data were published on the Central Bank website, in summarised form, on a daily basis.

(d) Labour Force Information and Public Sector Employment Survey

STD conducted overall labour market data analyses with respect to employment, unemployment, foreign employment, labour relations, strikes and labour market reforms by obtaining data/information from the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), the Department of Labour (DOL), Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFI) and other data providers. The Public Sector Employment Survey was conducted

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2019

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 124

Part II

on an annual basis covering all public sector institutions to ascertain the developments in the public sector employment.

(e) On Demand Surveys

In addition to the regular surveys, the Department carries out various other surveys based on the requirements to capture the information pertaining to sudden incidents/developments that might have a significant impact on the economy and/or on the important areas for central banking activities. During 2019, several on demand surveys were conducted to gather information on the economic impact of the unexpected conditions prevailed within the country. In addition, the Central Bank collaborated with 20 other central banks to carry out a global survey on “Price Setting Strategies and Frequency” to test the validity of several sticky-price theories in explaining the sluggishness of the aggregate price changes around the globe.

29.2 Compiling Indices

(a) Business Sentiment Indices

Business Sentiment Indices, namely, Business Condition, Profitability, Skilled Labour Availability, Sales, Demand and Capacity Utilisation were compiled utilising the responses obtained through the BOS, which provided an indication of the movement of the economy in the immediate past quarter and a quarter ahead. This information was used in GDP forecasting. The results were also presented to the MPC for evidence-based policy making purposes. Further, the major indices in aggregate form with a summary were published quarterly on the Central Bank website.

PMI Manufacturing with the sub-indices of New Orders, Production, Employment, Suppliers’ Delivery Time and Stock of Purchases, and PMI Services with the sub-indices of New Businesses, Business Activity, Employment, Backlogs of Work and Expectations for Activity were compiled to assess month-on-month change. The results provided high frequency data on short-term movement of the economy. This information was used in GDP forecasting and reported to the MPC for evidence-based policy decision making, while press notices were issued for the use of the general public. The PMI Construction survey was also conducted and the results were used in internal analyses.

(b) Property Price Indices

During 2019, the Land Price Index (base period: first half of 2017), covering 82 centres of all Divisional Secretariats of Colombo District, was compiled and published by the Department on a semi-annual basis. Three separate sub-indices representing Residential, Commercial and Industrial lands were compiled using per perch bare land prices obtained from the Government Valuation Department.

In addition, Residential Property Price Indices covering the condominium sector have been compiled since 2016 on monthly and quarterly bases for analytical purposes. The advertised price information obtained from the online property sales websites were used in compiling the monthly index, while actual sales transactions obtained through the Condominium Market Survey were used in compiling the quarterly index. These indices helped monitor the price developments in both the primary and secondary markets. In 2019, improvements to the compilation process were introduced with the assistance of the IMF and plans are underway to publish the indices in future.

(c) Wage Rate Indices

Wage rate indices covering public, formal and informal private sectors are compiled by STD to assess the movements of salaries and wages within the economy. During 2019, the Public sector wage rate index was rebased to 2016 (from 2012) in line with the initial salary codes of specific occupations as specified in the Public Administration Circular No. 03/2016 issued by the Ministry of Public Administration and Management on 25th February 2016. The data relating to the base period employment structure was obtained from the Census of Public and Semi Government Sector Employment conducted by the DCS in November 2016. Subsequently, the nominal and real wage rate indices for the public sector were compiled based on the public administration salary circulars that were issued from time to time. With regard to the formal private sector, real wage rate indices were compiled using the nominal wage rate indices for the employees in the Wages Boards Trades provided by the Department of Labour. The informal private sector wage rate index was compiled to assess the wage movements of the sector, based on the information collected through the CWDCS.

29.3 Forecasting Short Term Inflation and GDP

STD continuously contributed to the Forecasting and Policy Analysis System (FPAS) of the Central Bank by providing short-term forecasts of inflation and GDP with relevant analyses and other information. The Department prepared both model-based and indicator-based forecasts using relevant inputs from various sources. These forecasts were analysed and discussed at regular monetary policy cycles and submitted to the Monetary Board to facilitate policy decision making.

Both the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) and NCPI short term inflation forecasts were based on the recent price trends, expected price movements associated with market developments and econometric techniques. The Department continuously explored new variables, which reflect both the supply and demand side impact on inflation, to improve

Part II

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2019

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Part II - 125

inflation forecasting. Moreover, the inflation forecasts were updated frequently in line with the developments in input and output prices reflected through findings of surveys conducted by the Department. A new methodology was introduced in 2019 using daily prices, to minimise the inflation forecast error. Accordingly, the daily prices of main volatile food items were used to improve the CCPI inflation forecast as a part of continuous methodological improvements to the forecasting process.

With regard to the near-term GDP growth forecasts, both the indicator-based and the model-based techniques were used in forecasting. Leading economic indicators, survey findings and other primary and secondary information related to sub activities of the economy were combined with expert judgments in preparing indicator-based forecasts. Model based techniques were also used to forecast quarterly GDP.

29.4 Compiling Regional Statistics

(a) Sri Lanka Prosperity Index (SLPI)

In 2019, STD continued to compile and publish the SLPI to assess the overall prosperity of the country and its provinces. The index comprises three sub-indices, namely, Economic and Business Climate, Wellbeing of the People and Socio-Economic Infrastructure, which are compiled using 43 representative variables. Prosperity index values are compiled at the national level and provincial level separately. This is a useful measure for provincial authorities and other policy makers to identify the disparities in devising appropriate policy measures to address the concerns in different provinces. Further, the index and its sub-indices can be used to set up targets at provincial level and to evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented policies.

(b) Provincial Gross Domestic Product (PGDP)

STD continued to compile PGDP in nominal terms using a top-down methodology, where the national GDP statistics are disaggregated to the provinces using regional ratios derived through suitable provincial indicators related to provincial agricultural production, industry activities and value of services. Accordingly, upon the release of the annual GDP estimates by the DCS, the PGDP for 2018 was compiled and published in September 2019. These estimates measure and compare the economic activities across provinces, while providing an indication on the contribution of each province to the national GDP, so that they are employed as a base in allocating funds at regional levels for promoting focused development.

29.5 Disseminating Information

Timely and regular dissemination of official statistics, which is one of the vital functions of STD, was fulfilled during 2019 through both the printed and electronic modes. Accordingly, the two main annual statistical publications - “Economic

and Social Statistics of Sri Lanka 2019 – Volume XLI” and “Sri Lanka Socio Economic Data 2019 – Volume XLII” – were released in August and September 2019, respectively, in all three languages. The Department mainly contributed to two chapters of the Central Bank Annual Report and the Recent Economic Developments report and also continued to provide data for the Monthly Bulletin in 2019. The frequent releases of the Department, including the Daily Price Report of selected consumer items, and Weekly and Monthly Economic Indicators were published timely on the Central Bank website throughout the year. Moreover, various other information was disseminated by way of press releases to the public at large, while conducting knowledge sharing as and when required.

The tailored services of electronic data delivery were continued by the Department through the Data Library of the Central Bank, which is a system with a wide range of economic and financial data, produced by the Central Bank and other institutions, to foster economic research and education. The technical infrastructure and the visual layout of the system were improved during 2019 and the public were made aware of the changes via the newspapers.

30. Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions

The Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions (DSNBFI) is entrusted with the mandate to regulate and supervise Licensed Finance Companies (LFCs), Specialised Leasing Companies (SLCs) and Licensed Microfinance Companies (LMFCs) under the provisions of the Finance Business Act No.42 of 2011 (FBA), the Finance Leasing Act No.56 of 2000 (FLA) and the Microfinance Act No.06 of 2016, respectively. In addition, DSNBFI supervises the Primary Dealer Companies (PDCs) under the provisions of Registered Stock and Securities (Primary Dealers) Regulations No.01 of 2009 as amended and Local Treasury Bills (Primary Dealers) Regulations No.01 of 2009 as amended.

DSNBFI’s supervisory function includes conducting statutory examinations (on-site supervision) and continuous surveillance (off-site supervision) of the licensed entities, while the regulatory function involves issuance of prudential regulations, granting regulatory approvals, and investigating into companies carrying on finance business without authority. Apart from the major functions, DSNBFI also engages in several other activities such as capacity building of the sector, facilitating court proceedings and attending to public complaints.

As at end 2019, there were 42 LFCs, 4 SLCs, 3 LMFCs and 8 PDCs under the purview of the Department. In addition, licenses were granted to 61 Registered Finance Leasing Establishments (RFLEs) under the FLA, including the 4 SLCs. Also, currently there are 7 Licensed Commercial Banks appointed as Primary Dealers (PDs). The names of these
