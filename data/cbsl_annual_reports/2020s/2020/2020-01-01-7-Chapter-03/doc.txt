3.1 OverviewT

he government continued its efforts to

expand the country’s economic and social

infrastructure in 2019 despite tight fiscal

constraints, as infrastructure facilitates to harness

resources in the economy for production purposes,

improve the productivity of resources and enhance

the wellbeing of the people. Accordingly, the

government continued to facilitate numerous

infrastructure projects in several fields and

implemented measures aiming at developing the

country’s human resources. In order to augment

the country’s infrastructure base, the government

proceeded with several road development

activities, urban development and housing

projects, water supply and irrigation schemes,

and telecommunication projects. During the year

under review, the Southern Expressway Extension

project and Phase III of the Outer-Circular Highway

project were completed while making progress

in regional road network development projects

with the view of enhancing regional connectivity

and efficiency of the transport system, which will,

in turn, help people to save time for productive

activities, leisure and family life. Meanwhile, the

land reclamation activities of the Port City project

were completed in January 2019 and the land

reclaimed under the project was declared as a

part of the Colombo District and as an urban

development area under the purview of Urban

Development Authority. This landmark project aims

to build a world-class financial hub, while attracting

investment related to hotels and restaurants, retail

and office spaces, education, healthcare and

entertainment. In addition, numerous urban and

housing development projects continued in 2019

to meet increasing housing requirements in the

country and to upgrade the living standards of the

people. Improving access to safe drinking water

and irrigation water is also essential to enhance

wellbeing of the population. In this context, the

Uma Oya multipurpose project, which aims to

divert water for hydropower generation as well

as to provide irrigation water to the drier parts of

the Southern Province, was continued in 2019.

Four reservoirs under the Uma Oya project were

vested with the public in October 2019. Meanwhile,

the Information and Communication Technology

Agency (ICTA) continued implementing the Lanka

Government Network 2.0 project and the Lanka

Government Cloud 2.0 project in 2019 with the aim

of linking government organisations and creating

a big data cluster, thereby improving efficiency

and effectiveness of public services. However,

several infrastructure development projects, such

as the East Container Terminal at the Colombo

Port and Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA)

expansion project, progressed at a slower pace

during the year. The Easter Sunday attacks had

a notable impact on the Sri Lankan economy, and

the transport sector is one of the sectors that was

heavily affected. Accordingly, both passenger and

goods transportation through road, railway and

aviation modes declined during 2019 due to low

people movements over security concerns and

reduced activities in the economy.

The need for reforming State Owned Business

Enterprises (SOBEs) was felt in 2019, amidst the

weak performance of SOBEs. The dry weather

conditions that prevailed during the first seven

months of 2019 resulted in low hydropower

generation and more thermal-based power

generation. High reliance on fuel oil based power

generation resulted in heavy losses to the Ceylon

Electricity Board (CEB) during the year. Due to

the increased demand for electricity caused by

hot weather and limitations in power generation

capacity, the CEB opted for scheduled power cuts

during March and early April in 2019. Additionally,

delays in revising electricity tariffs in tandem

with the rising generation cost heightened the

financial burden on the CEB. Meanwhile, the

implementation of the generation expansion plan

of the CEB remained stalled due to bureaucratic

inefficiencies and flaws in tender and procurement

processes, exacerbating further financial losses to

the CEB. Hence, priority must be given to expedite

the power generation expansion plan to ensure

energy security of the country while reducing the

cost of electricity generation of the CEB. Although

domestic retail prices of fuel were regularly revised

until September 2019, the Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation (CPC) recorded a substantial loss,

since retail prices of fuel did not reflect the actual

costs. Nonrepayment of trade payables by the

CEB and SriLankan Airlines (SLA) also aggravated

the financial burden on the CPC. Further,

financial performance of many SOBEs such as

the SLA, Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB), Sri

Lanka Railways (SLR) and Department of Posts

(DOP) remained weak, highlighting the need for

productivity improvements and institutional reforms

in SOBEs, to convert them into results-driven,

consumer-centric organisations. The government

has already identified the importance of

transforming SOBEs into financially viable

institutions, but medium term plans need to be

formulated, while implementing effective policy

measures expeditiously to ease the persistent

fiscal burden due to the operations of SOBEs.

The government, with the support of the private

sector, strived to promote human development

through the provision of health and education

services while continuing with social assistance

programmes to uplift living standards of low

income households. The ‘13 Years of Guaranteed

Education’ and the ‘Nearest School is the Best

School’ programmes continued during the year with

a view to improving equitable access to education

and to meet dynamic skill demand in the job market.

The private sector also continued to play a major

role in providing education in the country. However,

the legal framework and the monitoring and quality

assurance mechanism should be strengthened

further to ensure that students acquire necessary

knowledge and skills to lead a productive adult

life. While noncommunicable diseases continue to

exert a substantial burden on the economy causing

high level of mortality and morbidity issues within

the population, the novel corona virus pandemic,

COVID-19, has created serious health concerns in

Sri Lanka in 2020, which will pose a notable impact

on the socio-economic front as well. Meanwhile,

the government enrolled over 400,000 families

for the Samurdhi programme in 2019 with the

view of extending financial assistance to a larger

number of low income households, increasing the

total number of Samurdhi beneficiaries to over 1.8

million households. Although social assistance and

poverty alleviation programmes have contributed

to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka to a great extent in

the past several decades, restructuring the social

assistance programmes in the country is vital to

effectively target the poor families who actually

need assistance, in order to eradicate poverty

by 2030 as envisaged by the United Nations’

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

3.2 Economic Infrastructure Policies, Institutional Framework and Performance

Petroleum

International crude oil (Brent) prices

remained low on average in 2019, compared to

the previous year. The average Brent price fell by

10.7 per cent to US dollars 64.04 per barrel in 2019,

from US dollars 71.76 per barrel in 2018. During the

first four months of 2019, the Brent price followed

an increasing trend and peaked at US dollars 71.45

per barrel in April 2019, before showing a declining

trend in general thereafter until mid October 2019

due to the escalation of the US-China trade war that

partly resulted in subdued global growth. However,

prices temporarily increased in July due to

expectations of a revival of global demand. Further,

oil prices surged significantly in mid September in

response to a terrorist attack on two oil producing

facilities in Saudi Arabia, one of the largest

producers in the world. Nevertheless, this price

increase was short-lived as Saudi Arabia assured

that production would be restored within a month.

Accordingly, the monthly average international

Brent price fell to US dollars 59.54 per barrel in

October 2019. Towards the end of the year, the

Brent price escalated with the expectations that

the US-China trade deal would boost demand

for oil. At the beginning of December 2019, the

Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries

(OPEC) agreed to cut output by 50 per cent until

March 2020, further supporting the upward price

movement. Meanwhile, the Brent price escalated to

US dollars 70 per barrel at the beginning of January

2020, with escalating tensions in the Middle East.

As worries of the Middle East tensions faded, crude

oil prices fell and a sharp reduction was observed

with the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak in

China, the world’s largest oil importer. As a result,

the average price of Brent was US dollars 51.65

per barrel in the first three months of 2020. In line

with international price trends, the average price of

crude oil imported by the CPC also declined by 9.8

per cent to US dollars 68.80 per barrel in 2019 from

US dollars 76.25 per barrel in 2018. Meanwhile, the

average import price of refined petroleum products

by the CPC decreased by 3.6 per cent to US dollars

571 per MT in 2019, from US dollars 592 per MT

in 2018.

Domestic retail prices of petroleum products

were revised regularly until September 2019

with the implementation of a pricing formula

in May 2018 and kept unchanged thereafter.

Accordingly, domestic retail prices of petroleum

products of the CPC were revised eight times during

2019. Further, Lanka IOC, which is the second

player in the market, also revised their retail prices

during the year. The administered retail prices of

the CPC for a litre of petrol (92 Octane), petrol

(95 Octane), auto diesel, super diesel, kerosene

and industrial kerosene were at the levels of

Rs. 137.00, Rs. 161.00, Rs. 104.00, Rs. 132.00,

Rs. 70.00 and Rs. 110.00, respectively, at end

December 2019. Compared to end 2018, price of

petrol (92 Octane), petrol (95 Octane), auto diesel

and super diesel were higher by 9.6 per cent, 8.1

per cent, 3.0 per cent and 9.1 per cent, respectively,

at end 2019. Meanwhile, the prices of furnace oil

800 and furnace oil 1,500 were also increased to

Rs. 96.00 per litre by end June 2019, compared to

Rs. 92.00 per litre at end September 2018. Sales

of petroleum products in the domestic market grew

by 4.8 per cent during 2019 with increased fuel oil

based power generation and higher demand from

the transportation sector. During the year, local

sales of petrol grew by 4.2 per cent mainly due

to increased demand from the transport sector.

Reflecting the increased fuel oil based electricity

generation owing to drought conditions, sales of

diesel increased by 6.5 per cent during 2019, in

comparison to the previous year. During 2019, total

petroleum sales to the industrial sector declined,

reflecting subdued growth in the industrial activities.

Further, petroleum sales to the aviation sector

also declined by 5.0 per cent due to the negative

impact of the Easter Sunday attacks on the aviation

sector. Meanwhile, sales of kerosene decreased by

1.6 per cent during the period under review.

The financial position of the CPC remained

weak in 2019. As per the provisional unaudited

financial statements, the CPC reported a loss of

Rs. 11.9 billion, before taxes, in 2019, mainly

due to the setting of administered prices of major

petroleum products, namely petrol (92 Octane),

diesel and kerosene, below the cost of the product

in spite of price revisions. Accordingly, the operating

loss per litre of petrol (92 Octane), auto diesel for

the transport sector and kerosene for the domestic

sector during 2019 stood at Rs. 4.72 Rs. 7.30 and

Rs. 29.01 respectively. Further, the loss from petrol

(92 Octane) and auto diesel for the transport sector,

and kerosene for domestic sector during 2019

amounted to Rs. 8.7 billion, Rs. 16.0 billion and

Rs. 7.7 billion, respectively. Accordingly, the CPC

made an operational loss of Rs. 19.1 billion in 2019.

In addition, the finance cost of the CPC amounted to

Rs. 14.7 billion in 2019. Meanwhile, borrowings of

the CPC from the banking sector increased during

the period, as a result of liquidity management

issues faced by the CPC due to non-payment of

trade receivables by major customers such as the

CEB and the SriLankan Airlines. Accordingly, the

CPC’s outstanding trade receivables from SOBEs

increased by 87.9 per cent to Rs. 154.3 billion as

at end 2019. At end 2019, the CEB and SriLankan

Airlines accounted for 55.7 per cent and 31.3

per cent of outstanding total trade receivables of

the CPC, respectively.

Renovation and modernisation of the

Sapugaskanda oil refinery continued during

2019. A bid round was called to select a suitable

designer for the Front end Engineering Design

for replacing the main crude distillation column,

diesel hydrotreater, and platformer unit of the

Sapugaskanda oil refinery, which have reached the

end of their life span. Several projects on repairing

crude oil lines, fuel oil lines and storage tanks

were in progress during the year. During this year,

bitumen production was 17,103 MT, following the

capacity enhancement in the refinery.

The Petroleum Resources Development

Secretariat (PRDS), the regulatory authority for

offshore hydrocarbon exploration, continued

its activities related to offshore hydrocarbon

exploration, development and production

work during 2019. The PRDS announced a mini

bid round in January 2019, to select a suitable

investor for the development and production of the

existing natural gas discovered in the M2 Block in

the Mannar Basin and further exploration of the

Block. The bid round was closed in June 2019

and the evaluation of bids progressed. Further, the

marketing round of the M2 Block commenced in

March 2019. The PRDS launched a bid round in

May 2019, inviting operators to submit proposals

expressing their interest in undertaking exploration

work in the M1 and C1 Blocks. Upon closing the

bid round in July 2019, the PRDS commenced its

evaluation process.

Electricity

Electricity generation increased by 3.3

per cent to 15,879 GWh in 2019, in comparison

to 15,374 GWh generated in 2018, with increased

dependence on thermal power generation.

The drought conditions that prevailed during the

first seven months of the year resulted in a decline

in hydropower generation excluding mini hydro

generation, by 26.5 per cent to 3,783 GWh in 2019.

However, the share of hydropower in electricity

generation gradually improved towards the end of

the year with increased rainfall to the catchment

areas. Meanwhile, the generation of electricity

through fuel oil and coal increased by 38.2

per cent and 12.5 per cent, respectively, to

5,016 GWh and 5,361 GWh, respectively. However,

the contribution of nonconventional renewable

energy (NCRE) sources including mini hydropower

plants to electricity generation, decreased by

6.2 per cent to 1,718 GWh in 2019 compared to the

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

105

previous year. This was mainly due to the reduction

in power generation by mini hydropower plants

owing to the dry weather conditions. Accordingly,

in 2019, shares of hydro, fuel oil, coal and NCRE

power generation in the total generation were

24 per cent, 32 per cent, 34 per cent and 11

per cent, respectively. Towards the end of the first

quarter of 2019, hydropower generation dropped

drastically, and accordingly, the CEB operated

all thermal power plants including high cost gas

turbines at their maximum capacity while resorting

to load shedding to accommodate the increased

electricity demand with the hot weather condition.

The CEB issued a schedule for daily power cuts

during March and early April in 2019. However,

interruptions to electricity supply ended with effect

from 11 April 2019. These power cuts caused a

considerable level of inconvenience to the public

while activities in the industry and services sectors

were also affected. Meanwhile, power plants owned

by the CEB contributed 71.1 per cent of the total

power generation in 2019, while the remainder

was purchased from independent power producers

(IPPs). The overall transmission and distribution loss

as a percentage of total power generation reduced

to 7.98 per cent in 2019 from 8.34 per cent in the

previous year.

Electricity sales increased by 3.7 per cent

to 14,612 GWh in 2019 from 14,091 GWh

in 2018. Sales to general purpose, religious,

domestic and industry categories, which account

for 21.1 per cent, 0.6 per cent, 32.7 per cent and

30.1 per cent of sales, respectively, increased

by 5.1 per cent, 4.9 per cent, 4.8 per cent and

2.4 per cent, respectively, in 2019. However,

electricity sales to the hotel sector, which accounts

1.9 per cent of sales, declined by 5.4 per cent in

2019, mainly due to poor sectoral performance

following the Easter Sunday attacks.

The financial performance of the CEB

weakened in 2019, mainly due to the heavy reliance

on fuel oil for electricity generation. According

to the unaudited provisional financial statements,

the CEB recorded a loss of Rs. 85.4 billion before

tax in 2019 compared to a loss of Rs. 30.5 billion

reported in 2018. Increased dependence on thermal

power due to dry weather conditions that prevailed

during the first seven months of 2019 was the main

reason for the deterioration of the financial position

of the CEB. The average costs to the CEB in relation

to hydro, coal and fuel oil power generation were

Rs. 2.49, Rs. 10.48 and Rs. 31.93 per kWh,

respectively. The average cost of electricity

purchases by the CEB from IPPs amounted to

Rs. 26.47 per kWh in 2019 as against Rs. 24.47

per kWh recorded in the previous year. Further, the

overall average cost of electricity at the selling point

was Rs. 23.29 per kWh, whereas the overall average

tariff amounted to Rs. 16.62 per kWh in 2019 resulting

in a loss of Rs. 6.7 per kWh. Accordingly, the overall

average cost of electricity at the selling point as well as

the overall average tariff registered increases of 21.8

per cent and 2.0 per cent, respectively, in comparison

to the preceding year. In 2019, the average electricity

tariffs charged by the CEB from domestic, general

purpose, government, industrial and hotel sectors

were Rs. 14.11, Rs. 23.91, Rs. 18.19, Rs. 14.72 and

Rs. 17.75 per kWh, respectively. The CEB’s short

term borrowings from banks and other short term

liabilities to the CPC and IPPs increased to Rs. 223.2

billion by end 2019 from Rs. 142.2 billion at end 2018.

Meanwhile, the CEB’s long term outstanding liabilities

increased to Rs. 421.7 billion by end 2019 from Rs.

392.2 billion recorded at end 2018. The weakened

financial position of the CEB emphasises the urgent

need for power generation through cheaper sources

by introducing an optimal and feasible energy

generation mix for the country. Further, accelerating

the implementation process of a cost reflective pricing

mechanism for the CEB in collaboration with the

Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) is

necessary to improve the financial performance of the

CEB. Due to the nonrepayment of payables by the

CEB, the CPC was compelled to borrow substantially

from the banking sector, which highlights the urgent

need of addressing the financial issues of the CEB to

reduce bank lending to SOBEs. In March 2020, the

Cabinet approved the establishment of a crude oil

price stabilisation fund aiming to maintain domestic

prices at stable levels by absorbing global oil price

fluctuations.

In 2019, the CEB submitted the annual Least

Cost Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan

(LCLTGEP) pertaining to the period from 2020

to 2039 for the approval of the PUCSL. The

energy mix proposed through the LCLTGEP, which

is to be achieved by end 2039, comprises 30.0 per

cent Natural Gas, 30.0 per cent coal power, 25.0

per cent large hydro and 15.0 per cent from both

other renewable energy sources and furnace oil.

Timely implementation of this generation expansion

plan is of paramount importance to meet the growing

demand for energy while minimising the costs to the

CEB.

Construction work of several major power

projects was in progress in 2019 while plans

were underway to set up additional thermal

power plants. During 2019, the Cabinet of Ministers

granted approval to construct two 300 MW natural

gas combined cycle power plants in Kerawalapitiya,

and a 300 MW coal fired plant as an extension to

the existing complex in Norochcholai, which are

expected to add to the national grid by 2023. The

preparation of the Request for Proposals (RFP) for

diesel power plants to be constructed in Habarana,

Moneragala, Horana and Pallekele, which comprise

24 MW in each unit, was also in progress during the

year and these plants are expected to be connected

to the national grid by 2022. Construction work of

the Uma Oya hydropower project (120 MW) and

the Broadlands hydropower project (35 MW) was in

progress during 2019 and these power plants are

expected to be connected to the national grid in

2020. Further, preparatory work was in progress in

relation to Seethawaka Ganga hydropower project

(24MW), Thalpitigala hydropower project (15 MW)

and Moragolla hydropower project (30 MW).

The government continued its efforts

to promote renewable energy generation

expansion projects in the country in 2019. The

feasibility study, environmental impact assessment

and land procurement process of the Mannar wind

park, which is expected to add 100 MW to the national

grid, have been finalised and the site construction

work commenced in 2019. Project completion and

the commencement of commercial operation are

expected in 2020. In 2019, the prefeasibility study

for the Pooneryn solar-wind hybrid energy park was

conducted by the International Finance Corporation

(IFC). Accordingly, it has been proposed to develop

a 130 MW solar power plant in the first stage of

the project within a two year period and develop a

238.5 MW wind power plant during the next three

year period. Meanwhile, 35 solar photovoltaic (PV)

projects, in which each project has the capacity of

1MW, were under construction, while tender awards

for 75 solar PV projects were in progress in 2019.

Meanwhile, in 2019, 1,545 consumers joined the

Soorya Bala Sangramaya, and 18 MW have been

added to the national grid under the project.

In 2019, the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy

Authority (SLSEA) actively engaged in

developing strategies to promote reliable,

affordable and sustainable energy to all

citizens. The SLSEA continued to facilitate energy

conservation in the commercial, industrial and

domestic sectors, and accordingly, seven energy

managers were accredited in 2019. By the end of

the year, 223 energy managers were registered

with the SLSEA. During the period under review,

the SLSEA conducted energy education and

energy conservation promotion programmes

and the Vidulka national energy symposium to

educate the general public. Further, the SLSEA

was in the process of formulating action plans

on meeting the challenging goal of generating

80 per cent of electricity from renewable resources

and increasing energy efficiency by 20 per cent by

2030.

In 2019, several measures were taken to

regulate the electricity sector. During the year,

the PUCSL prepared a policy advice document

for the government on the increase in electric

vehicle usage in the country. Accordingly, it was

proposed to revisit the tax structure on Electric

Vehicles (EV), incorporate EV charging facilities

in urban development plans, include EV charging

facilities as a basic requirement in the building

plan approval processes, improve EV usage for

government institutions and encourage private

investment in EV charging station facilities at

public parking areas. Further, the licensing

framework for electricians was finalised in 2019

and was forwarded for the approval of the Cabinet

of Ministers. During the period under review,

the PUCSL conducted a public consultation on

the national draft policy on the liquid natural gas

industry to obtain stakeholder views on the draft

policy for its better implementation.

Introduction

Energy is imperative for economic growth as it is a fundamental input for all economic activities including industrial production, transportation and household consumption. Though the gains from economic growth through increased energy consumption have been impressive across the globe, such high energy usage has far-reaching implications on environmental systems and the society mainly due to unsustainable practices. These unsustainable energy usage practices not only result in a rapid depletion of energy sources, but also cause climate change that can have detrimental effects on living beings as well as the environment. Though the basic need for energy cannot be changed, policymakers have identified the need to opt for more sustainable energy sources, due to adverse effects caused by fossil fuel based energy sources. Hence, management and development of energy sources are identified by the United Nations as core requirements for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Under the SDG-7, all countries are committed to provide ‘access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all’. In a broader sense, sustainable energy underpins almost all SDGs, particularly related to industrialisation, economic growth, sustainable cities, poverty reduction, health, education as well as climate change. The Paris Agreement - 2015, of which Sri Lanka is also a signatory, has recognised that carbon-intensive economic growth is no longer a route for sustainable development. Therefore, clean and sustainable energy sources should be the centre of Sri Lanka’s sustainable development agenda.

Sustainable energy is a multidimensional concept that advocates the provision of adequate and reliable energy to both current and future generations, at affordable prices in an environmentally friendly manner. Sustainable energy usage includes three facets: first, environmental sustainability that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and harmful and toxic waste, and minimise adverse effects on biodiversity; second, social sustainability that encompasses poverty eradication, improving living standards and wellbeing of the people as well as energy security; third, economic sustainability that ensures low cost and affordability of energy sources, reliability of the energy supply and employment creation in relation to energy generation. Although renewable energy is generally referred to as sustainable energy sources, not all renewable energy projects are necessarily sustainable. For instance, biomass is renewable energy, but clearing of forests for biomass production and cultivation of plants for biomass production in a water scarce area are not environmentally sustainable practices. Therefore, renewable energy also needs to be used in a sustainable manner. All energy sources have their own advantages and disadvantages in relation to environmental, social and economic fronts.

BOX 6Powering Sustainable Growth and Development

Hence, a country needs to consider the full range of energy sources available for the country by weighing their pros and cons and select an appropriate sustainable energy mix. Meanwhile, the shift towards sustainable energy usage not only focusses on the supply side of energy, but also emphasises on its demand side, particularly in terms of improving energy efficiency and optimising energy usage.

Economic development of a country has a strong positive correlation with energy usage, and most often with high greenhouse gas emissions. However, renewable energy sources can play an important role in reducing this correlation and contributing towards sustainable development than non-renewable energy sources. However, as depicted by Figure B 8.1, fossil fuels account for 55 per cent of primary energy supply in the country. Meanwhile, the total energy demand in Sri Lanka has increased from 336.8 petajoules1 in 2005 to 423.8 petajoules by 2017, reflecting approximately 1.9 per cent growth in overall energy demand per annum. According to the Sri Lanka Energy Balance – 2017 report, the transport sector, which primarily uses petroleum as the source of energy, accounted for 36 per cent of the energy demand in the country. From the energy supply point of view, electricity, which is the main secondary energy2 source in Sri Lanka, has met 11.4 per cent of the total energy demand in the country (Sri Lanka Energy Balance – 2017). However, Sri Lanka’s electricity sector is heavily reliant on carbon-intensive primary energy sources, which contributed 66 per cent of the total electricity generation in 2019. With the increased fuel oil and coal based power generation in the country, the carbon dioxide emission factor3 of Sri

1 1 petajoule = 1015 joules2 Secondary energy refers to more convenient forms of energy that are derived from other energy sources through energy conversion processes.3 As per the Sri Lanka Energy Balance -2017 report, the carbon dioxide emission factor is calculated by dividing the total emissions of the power sector by the total number of units of electricity produced in the country in that particular year.

Lanka’s electricity grid has increased from 315.8 g CO2/kWh in 2010 to 584.5 g CO2/kWh by 2017, resulting in an 85 per cent increase in carbon dioxide emissions from the electricity sector within seven years. The carbon dioxide emission factor in 2017 translates into 8.575 million metric tonnes of CO2 emissions by the electricity sector during that year. These trends highlight the necessity of a shift towards clean and renewable energy sources for transportation and electricity generation, while reducing the growth of energy demand through energy efficiency improvements and energy saving practices, to ensure sustainability of the overall energy sector.

Renewable Energy as Sustainable Energy Sources in Electricity and Transport Sectors

Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, waves and tides, are generally considered as sustainable energy sources. Since renewable energy sources are derived from natural processes, they are replenished constantly ensuring future availability of the resource. Renewable energy sources generate minimal or zero greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, a shift towards renewable energy helps combat climate change. Generally, prices of non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuel are highly volatile due to demand and supply conditions, and are more prone to geopolitical tensions. Therefore, diversification into renewable energy sources lowers the demand for fossil fuel, and thereby reduces the cost of purchasing non-renewable energy sources. Since Sri Lanka relies heavily on imported fossil fuel for electricity generation, the energy sector has a major bearing on the trade balance and the exchange rate. A shift towards sustainable renewable energy sources will ease the external sector burden of the country to a greater extent.

With the current drive towards sustainable development, the role of renewable energy in global climate change mitigation and energy supply security has been widely recognised around the world. According to the Renewable Capacity Statistics -2019 report of the International Renewable Energy Agency, renewables accounted for almost two-thirds of global new power generation capacity additions in 2018. Accordingly, the global wind electricity generation capacity increased by 49 GW, led by China and the USA during 2018. Meanwhile, the solar electricity generation capacity in the world grew by 24 per cent with the addition of 94 GW. Asia alone accounted for 61 per cent of the total new renewable energy installations in 2018, registering a growth of 11.4 per cent (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2019a). But, Oceania recorded the fastest growth of 17.7 per cent, mainly driven by a large increase in the Australian solar power generation capacity. Further, growth in renewables usage averted 215 metric tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2018, of which a major portion was achieved through the transition to renewables in the power sector (International Energy Agency, 2019b). Brazil, which had been heavily reliant on hydropower (over 80 per cent of national electricity

demand), turned to other renewable technologies to meet rising electricity demand while reducing the country’s vulnerability to energy shortages in drought years. Meanwhile, Chile set a national target of 20 per cent renewable electricity (excluding hydropower) by 2025. Although coal continues to be the largest primary energy source, India is increasingly tapping into its vast renewable energy potential and increasing investment in solar power with the aim of becoming a world leader in renewable energy.

Further, transport systems around the world are also gradually shifting towards low emission options. Accordingly, electric mobility is rapidly expanding across countries. The electric car fleet in the world surpassed 5.1 million in 2018, registering a 2 million increase from the previous year. The world’s largest electric car market is China, followed by Europe and the United States, but a shift towards electric vehicle usage is emerging in other countries as well (International Energy Agency, 2019c). Chile, for instance, has one of the largest electric bus fleets in the world after China. Chile targets to electrify 100 per cent of its public transportation system by 2040 and 40 per cent of its private transportation system by 2050. Many European countries, including the United Kingdom, Netherland and Belgium, have committed to increase their electric bus fleet. In addition, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden account for approximately 8 per cent of the total number of electric cars around the world. Further, Norway, Iceland and Sweden record the highest per capita usages in the world. Among many other advanced economies, New Zealand also adopted policies to make a transition to a net-zero emissions economy by 2050 (International Energy Agency, 2019c). However, sustainability of electric vehicle usage depends on the carbon intensity of the electricity used to charge vehicles. If the country’s electricity is highly reliant on fossil fuel based power generation, even electrical vehicles could leave a massive carbon footprint.

Sri Lanka is enriched with several renewable resources such as hydropower, solar and wind power. More than one third of the electricity generation in the country is achieved using renewable resources, primarily hydropower. However, hydropower has increasingly become a less reliable energy source due to regular and intense drought periods experienced by the country, resulting in unprecedented surges in fossil fuel-based generation. Meanwhile, large projects designed to exploit hydropower have become complicated due to social and environmental implications on surrounding areas. On the other hand, Sri Lanka is yet to extensively exploit other non-conventional renewable energy sources (NCRE) such as solar and wind power. Being an island, Sri Lanka has a potential to generate electricity through sea waves and tides, but this remains an untapped potential thus far. However, several measures have been taken to promote renewable energy in Sri Lanka to reduce the country’s dependence on oil and rainfall in the long run. In line with the Least Cost Long

Term Generation Expansion Plan of the CEB, the SLSEA aims to increase the share of renewable energy, apart from major hydropower, in power generation from the current level of 10.7 per cent to 15 per cent by end-2030. The government launched a community based solar power generation project in 2016, Soorya Bala Sangramaya, in collaboration with the SLSEA, the CEB and the Lanka Electricity Company (Private) Limited (LECO). This programme expects to add 200 MW of solar electricity to the national grid by 2020 and 1,000 MW by 2025. Meanwhile, the construction of several wind power plants in Mannar and Pooneryn is in progress. Although waste management has become a serious issue in the country, only one waste-to-energy project has been commissioned up to now. Growth in non-conventional renewable energy generation is still slow paced in Sri Lanka, hence the government and private sector entities need to make a concerted effort to fast-track the NCRE capacity expansion in the country.

Limitations of NCRE as Sustainable Energy Sources

As any other energy source, NCRE has its limitations in terms of sustainability. The primary barrier for the usage of NCRE such as solar and wind, is the high capital related to installation of the power plants. Although these sources typically require large upfront capital investments, financial returns over the long term are uncertain, and partly dependent on national policies on issues such as feed-in tariffs. Hence, financial institutions are more likely to perceive renewable projects as risky, charging high interest rates on project borrowings. Generally, NCRE sources offer a decentralised generation model, in which, smaller generating stations are spread across a large area. Hence, cost of transmission is relatively high in such models where financing can be a significant barrier for both developers and end users. The average cost of generation is still perceived to be high for most NCREs in comparison to that of coal. However, many countries have been able to drastically reduce the cost of NCRE in recent years, through competitive bidding for energy procurement, government grants and subsidies for NCRE producers, especially for household level production, and duty waivers for the importation of solar PV panels. For instance, India has been able to reduce the cost of wind power to be on par or lower than the cost of energy generation from imported coal (Shrimali et. al., 2015). Moreover, the cost of setting up solar power plants in India has declined by 80 per cent between 2010 to 2018 and the country recorded the world’s lowest installation cost of new solar power plants in 2018 (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2019b). Meanwhile, CEB’s estimates of the cost of coal power generation does not include the cost of financing the coal power plant, whereas the estimate of the cost of NCRE comprises repayment of project costs to the NCRE producers by the CEB. Hence, the CEB’s costs cannot be directly used to compare the costs of different energy sources. Accordingly, the World Bank and International Finance Corporation have estimated the

cost of coal and NCRE sources in Sri Lanka to be USD cents 9/kWh and USD cents 11.33/kWh, respectively, in 2017. Since the cost of coal power generation does not include the cost to the environment, coal cannot be considered as a clear winner over NCRE in terms of cost even in Sri Lanka.

Though renewable energy resources are available around the world, many of these resources are intermittent energy sources and are not available year-round. Solar, wind, wave and tidal energy sources are intermittently available depending on the weather and the time of day. Most electricity grids are constructed to comply with nonintermittent energy sources such as fuel oil based or coal fired power plants. However, overall intermittency of the renewable energy sources can be reduced by using a combination of these sources. With more and more NCRE sources integrated into the system, grid modifications become necessary to ensure the supply of electricity is matched to daily variation in demand. Further, geographic limitations such as climate, topographies and vegetation also affect the installation of renewable energy plants. The extra challenge against solar power is recycling or disposing of solar panels without causing health and environmental hazards since they contain base metals such as lead, chromium, and cadmium. This can be a fairly costly process.

Way Forward

Sustainable energy usage is crucial for both economic and human development. Since the electricity and transportation sectors are energy-intensive activities, sustainable energy usage should be promoted in these sectors. In this regard, Sri Lanka needs to formulate an appropriate sustainable energy mix for electricity generation in consideration of long run economic costs as well as externalities of energy sources on the environment and society. Competitive bidding by electricity producers that use various energy sources should be encouraged to reduce overall cost of energy generation. As Sri Lanka is highly dependent on fossil fuels, the country faces a wide spectrum of challenges in the transition towards sustainable energy such as cost reflective energy pricing, grid modifications and energy conservation. Non-renewable energy sources are likely to be financially attractive than NCRE sources since financial costs of fuel oil and coal do not encompass the cost of environmental effects of those sources. Prior to the sharp decline in oil prices due the COVID-19 pandemic, most petroleum products in Sri Lanka were at subsidised prices without reflecting their true economic costs. Therefore, financial incentives are needed to make NCRE sources more financially attractive than non-renewable sources. Attractive feed-in tariffs, net metering systems, investment tax credits, subsidised interest rates for project loans, green bonds and soft loans are possible financial interventions to promote NCRE projects in the country.

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

111

Higher dependence on intermittent energy sources requires grid modifications to balance demand and supply conditions. When the share of NCRE in total electricity generation increases, Sri Lanka will need grid energy storage methods, such as pumped-storage hydroelectricity and batteries, to store and release excess energy when required. However, pumped-storage hydroelectricity is feasible only at locations near hills, and battery technologies are still expensive. Nevertheless, complementary energy sources such as hydroelectricity or natural gas can be used to produce backup power. In addition, reducing demand for electricity at certain times of the day through smart grid usage and energy demand management can also ease intermittency issues.

With the high reliance on non-renewable sources for electricity generation in Sri Lanka, electric vehicle usage may not reduce greenhouse gas emissions as expected. Given the electricity capacity constraints in the country, electric vehicle usage needs to be promoted with caution. However, sustainable energy usage in the transport sector can be supported through energy demand-side management policies. For instance, improving the efficiency, reliability and comfort of public transport systems, increasing fuel efficient vehicle fleet, minimising travel by better urban designs, improving on-road fuel efficiency through better traffic management, promotion of low carbon fuels and encouraging people to shift to nonmotorised modes, including biking and walking, are some measures that can promote sustainable energy usage in the transport sector.

Sustainable energy use for economic growth and development will require significant transformations in physical systems, policies, regulatory frameworks and people’s perceptions with regard to production and consumption of energy. To this end, the government, private sector and the general public must make a collaborative effort to ensure energy sustainability, and thereby sustainable growth and development. Meanwhile, commitment towards energy sustainability is essential to provide policy certainty, clear direction for green energy investment and encourage required structural changes such as the implementation of cost reflective pricing strategy for CEB and CPC.

Road Development

The government continued its activities

related to the construction of new roads and the

rehabilitation of existing roads during 2019 with

the aim of enhancing regional connectivity in the

country. The total length of National Highways (A and

B class roads) maintained by the Road Development

Authority (RDA) was approximately 12,220 km while

the total length of expressways was 217.8 km, as at

end 2019. The expenditure incurred by the RDA for

the development and the maintenance of the national

highway network and the construction of expressways

in 2019 stood at Rs. 155.2 billion. Accordingly, the RDA

spent Rs. 55.5 billion on expressway development

and Rs. 71.8 billion on highway development while

spending Rs. 9.4 billion on the construction of bridges

and flyovers during 2019.

During the year under review, several road

construction, rehabilitation and maintenance

projects were continued with financial support

from foreign and local sources. The rehabilitation

of the Medawachchiya to Horowpathana road was

commenced in end March 2019 under the Northern

Road Connectivity Project (NRCP), with the financial

assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

Further, procurement work with respect to the

Integrated Road Investment Programme-II (i-Road

II) for the Eastern and Northern Provinces was

completed and the construction work commenced

during 2019. Procurement work for the same

project in the Western Province neared completion

during the year. Rehabilitation of six road sections

under the Priority Road Project 3 - Phases (I) and

(II), was completed during the period under review.

More than 50 per cent of the construction work of

under the Kelani River New Bridge Construction

Project at Peliyagoda was also completed during

the period. Meanwhile, the development work

of the Badulla - Chenkaladi Road Improvement

Project and the Awakening Polonnaruwa

District Development Programme were also

continued in 2019. Further, under the Rural Road

Re-awakening programme and the Ran Mawath rural

road maintenance and construction programme, a

road length of 765.5 km was completed in 2019.

The construction work related to the national

expressway network also continued during

2019. Phase - (III) of the Outer Circular Highway

(OCH), which connects the Kadawatha and

Kerawalapitiya interchanges with a link to the

Colombo-Katunayake Expressway, was completed

and opened to the public on 09 November 2019.

This project consisted of a road length of 9.6 km.

Further, the extension of the Southern Expressway

from Matara to Hambantota, including the

expressway link to Mattala was completed and

was opened to the public in February 2020. This

extension connects the country’s two main ports

and airports, enabling easy transfer of goods and

passengers. In addition, construction work of the

169 km long Central Expressway project and

74 km long Ruwanpura expressway project also

continued in 2019. Meanwhile, expressways which

are currently in operation generated revenue of

Rs. 8.6 billion during 2019, compared to Rs. 8.4

billion in 2018. The total vehicle traffic in the Southern

Expressway grew by 5.6 per cent to 14.0 million

vehicles in 2019. However, the volume of vehicle

traffic in the Colombo Katunayake Expressway

and OCH recorded a decrease of 1.2 per cent

and 11.1 per cent, respectively, mainly due to the

slowdown in transport activities owing to the Easter

Sunday attacks. The lack of a proper methodology

for land acquisition for road construction projects

has resulted in a large number of court cases

and has adversely affected the progress of road

infrastructure development projects. Hence, the

government needs to adopt timely, efficient and

proactive policy measures for land acquisition,

payment of compensation and resettlement in order

to minimise delays in road construction projects.

Several measures were taken by the

government to mitigate landslide disasters on

national roads and to reduce traffic congestion.

Currently, a project with financial assistance from

Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)

is being carried out to mitigate landslide disasters

on national roads through the implementation of

appropriate countermeasures in highland areas.

The total estimated cost of the project is Rs. 16.2

billion and ten high priority locations have been

selected to implement the project. Meanwhile, 156

junctions have been earmarked for improvement,

while 79 locations have been identified in the

Colombo metropolitan region for the installation

of pelican crossings under the Advanced Traffic

Management System (ATMS) project. Basic

design for the project has been completed covering

211.4 km of road length. Further, 133 junctions

will be improved under Phase (I) of the project on

a priority basis and the detailed design has been

completed. Accordingly, the government is in the

process of seeking funding for the project, which

aims to support economic activities in the Colombo

metropolitan region by relieving traffic congestion,

strengthening traffic safety, and improving public

transport.

Road Passenger Transportation

Road passenger transportation witnessed

a subdued performance in both public and

private sector transport operations, primarily

due to low passenger movements subsequent

to the Easter Sunday attacks. The total operated

kilometrage of buses of the Sri Lanka Transport

3

Board (SLTB) decreased by 3.4 per cent to

431.3 million km, while total passenger kilometrage

recorded a significant reduction of 22.7 per cent to

12 billion km compared to the preceding year. In the

meantime, operated kilometrage and passenger

kilometrage of private buses also declined by

2.3 per cent to 1.1 billion km and 2.2 per cent

to 54.2 billion km, respectively, in comparison

to 2018. As against the previous year, the total

number of buses owned by the SLTB increased by

4.3 per cent to 7,251, while the average number

of buses operated by the SLTB declined by

2.8 per cent to 5,079 in 2019. Further, the total

number of buses owned by the private sector

declined marginally by 0.3 per cent to 19,979

from 20,030 of 2018. During 2019, the number of

inter-provincial and intra-provincial permits issued

by the National Transport Commission (NTC) for

private bus operations stood at 3,110 and 16,852,

respectively.

The NTC continued to focus on transport

expansion activities in 2019. The NTC extends

its special bus services, namely Sisu Seriya, Gemi

Seriya and Nisi Seriya in collaboration with the

SLTB, to provide special public transport services.

The expenditure incurred on the Sisu Seriya bus

service, which provides reliable and safe services

to school children, amounted to Rs. 546.8 million in

2019. In total, 1,419 buses were deployed to provide

Sisu Seriya services. Under the Gemi Seriya

service, which improves accessibility of people who

live in rural areas, 11 new services were initiated.

Expenditure on the Gemi Seriya service amounted

to Rs. 2.7 million during 2019. The Nisi Seriya

bus service continued to facilitate public transport

service during the night time. The expenditure on

this service was around Rs. 14.4 million in 2019,

and six new bus services were deployed under the

Nisi Seriya programme during the year. Moreover,

the online seat booking facility for inter-provincial

bus services was continued during the period

under review. During 2019, the NTC took initial

steps to implement the Google Transit facility with

the aim of assisting the public by providing details

of bus routes, rail routes, train stations, and other

public transport related information. The facility will

be made available in the Western Province initially

and subsequently expanded across all other

provinces. At the initial stages, users will be able to

obtain schedules of public transport modes before

the service is upgraded to provide real-time data.

In the meantime, special amendments to inter-

provincial highway bus fares were enacted by the

NTC in November 2019. However, there was no

annual bus fare revision in 2019 after the revision

in December 2018.

Several programmes initiated by the SLTB

to cater to public transport needs continued in

2019. The SLTB engaged in upgrading the fleet

through the addition of 334 new buses in 2019.

The SLTB purchased nine luxury buses worth

Rs. 17.1 million each, with the intention of providing

high quality transportation services and assigned

those buses to six bus depots. Steps were taken to

purchase 600 buses under an Indian credit facility

and 80 luxury buses under the 2019 budget.

The financial performance of the SLTB

showed a slowdown in 2019 as a result of

subdued transport activities in the economy. As

per the provisional unaudited financial statements,

total revenue of the SLTB declined by 1.4 per cent

to Rs. 43.5 billion mainly due to the 6.1 per cent

reduction in revenue earned from passenger fares

in 2019. Meanwhile, operating expenditure also

decreased marginally to Rs. 41.9 billion, resulting in

an operating profit of Rs. 1.6 billion in 2019, when

compared to the profit of Rs. 2.2 billion recorded in

2018. The reduction in revenue in 2019 could be

3

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

attributed to reduced passenger movements through

public and private bus operations after the Easter

Sunday attacks. Meanwhile, subsidies granted by

the government for the operation of uneconomical

routes and subsidised season tickets were around

Rs. 5.5 billion each in 2019.

The registration of new motor vehicles

declined by 23.6 per cent to 367,303 in 2019

from 480,799 vehicles registered in the

previous year. Notable reductions in registrations

were recorded for almost all vehicle categories.

Accordingly, registration of motor cars, buses and

goods transport vehicles declined by 52.7 per cent,

45.5 per cent, and 44.3 per cent, respectively.

Policy measures taken by the Central bank and

the government in 2018 to curtail vehicle imports

resulted in a significant reduction in motor vehicle

registrations in the first half of 2019. However, some

of these restrictions, such as the margin deposit

requirements and restrictions on opening of Letters

of Credit (LCs) for the importation of motor vehicles

under concessionary permits, were removed by

mid 2019, leading to a gradual increase in vehicle

registrations in the second half of the year. With the

increasing income levels in the country, demand

for quality and comfortable transportation systems

is rising. However, public transport systems have

not been upgraded to meet the changing demands

in the economy, resulting in a greater number of

people using privately owned vehicles. Although

macroprudential and fiscal policy measures can

be used to curtail vehicle imports to the country

temporarily, the quality and efficiency of the public

transport systems should be enhanced in the long run

if this issue is to be addressed and to reduce external

imbalances caused by excessive vehicle imports.

Good quality and cost effective public transport

systems will not only improve the trade balance,

but will also reduce congestion, pollution and fuel

wastage. Moreover, these efficiency improvements

will be time saving, enabling individuals to spend

more time on productive as well as leisure activities.

Rail Transportation

In 2019, the Sri Lanka Railway (SLR) recorded

a decrease in both passenger and freight

transportation compared to the previous year,

mainly due to limited passenger movements

in the aftermath of the Easter Sunday attacks

and two strikes carried out by railway workers.

The rail passenger kilometrage decreased by

5.2 per cent to 7.3 billion km in 2019 in comparison

to 7.7 billion km in 2018. Meanwhile, the goods

kilometrage also recorded a decline of 3.5 per cent

to 115.6 million MT km in 2019 from 119.8 million

MT km in 2018.

The SLR continued to improve railway

infrastructure in 2019, through the construction

of new railway tracks, rehabilitation of existing

rail tracks and enhancement of railway services

and rolling stock. During the year, the SLR

completed the construction of a 27 km railway line

from Matara to Beliatta, with a view to expanding

railway services in Southern Sri Lanka. Meanwhile,

double tracking of the Katunayake - Kurana railway

line with a signal system was completed during the

period under review. In 2019, the SLR commenced

double tracking of the railway line from Polgahawela

to Kurunegala, the railway line that connects Kandy,

Peradeniya and Kadugannawa, and the railway line

from Payagala to Aluthgama. Further, rehabilitation

of the railway line from Maho to Omanthei using an

Indian line of credit and maintenance work of the

Kelani Valley railway line were continued during

2019. In addition, the SLR commenced initial work

on a new bridge at Maggona. In 2019, consultancy

work on the Colombo Suburban Railway Project

(CSRP) was also in progress. With the expectation

of enhancing railway operations, the SLR initiated

the Rail Efficiency Improvement Project (REIP), in

parallel to the CSRP, with financial assistance from

the Asian Development Bank.

Meanwhile, the SLR took several measures to

strengthen the rolling stock by the importation

of new units and rehabilitation of existing

units. In 2019, the SLR purchased five power

sets for upcountry services, seven locomotives,

five power sets for other regions, 30 oil tank

wagons, and 20 container flat wagons. During the

year, five new train services; two services from

Colombo Fort to Polonnaruwa, two services from

Maradana to Beliatta and one from Colombo Fort

to Kankesanthurai were introduced. Meanwhile,

steps have also been taken to improve passenger

facilities, such as seat reservation and cafeterias.

The signalling and telecommunication system of the

railway around the country was strengthened during

the year. Accordingly, the SLR completed 170 new

protected level crossing systems under a project

that aims to install 200 level crossings. Further,

initial activities to establish a new signal system from

Maho to Omanthai were carried out during the year.

The financial performance of the SLR

remained weak in 2019 as well. As per the

provisional financial statements, the SLR recorded

an operating loss of Rs. 7.6 billion during the year,

compared to a loss of Rs. 7 billion in 2018. The total

revenue of the SLR at Rs. 7.9 billion, registered an

increase of 6.6 per cent in 2019 in comparison to

the previous year, mainly due to the upward revision

of passenger fares in October 2018. Accordingly,

passenger fares, which account for about 80.9 per

cent of the total revenue, registered an increase

of 7.8 per cent in 2019 in comparison to 2018.

During the year, current and capital expenditures

also increased by 7.5 per cent and 33.8 per cent,

respectively, to Rs. 15.5 billion and Rs. 20.4 billion,

respectively. The increase in current expenditure

was primarily driven by the 8.8 per cent growth

in personnel emoluments, while the increase in

capital expenditure was mainly due to the purchase

of rolling stock.

The SLR has the potential to improve its

services as a low cost mass transportation

mode for passengers and goods, and thereby

reduce urban and suburban traffic congestion

to a great extent. However, improvement of the

railway service is essential to provide a comfortable

and efficient transport mode for the public. As at end

2019, 65 per cent of the train fleet owned by the SLR

were older than 30 years. Therefore, modernisation

of the existing rolling stock as well as railway tracks

is required to overcome losses in terms of productive

man hours and energy utilisation. Further, the

reliability of the service is the most important factor

for railway transportation to become a popular

and efficient mode of transportation. According to

the overall train operations statistics of the SLR,

48.4 per cent of trains were not operated punctually

and 7.5 per cent trains had been delayed by more

than one hour in 2018. Meanwhile, 4.9 per cent

of the scheduled trains were cancelled during

the same period. Hence, it is necessary for

the SLR to identify possible reasons for delays

and cancellations, and formulate solutions to

improve the efficiency of service delivery. Further,

establishing parking facilities near railway stations

to encourage the park and ride concept must be

explored as a solution for congestion in urban

areas.

Civil Aviation

The civil aviation sector recorded a negative

performance in 2019, primarily due to the

decline in tourist arrivals in the aftermath of

the Easter Sunday attacks. Due to the lower

demand for travelling to Sri Lanka owing to

security concerns after the Easter Sunday attacks,

11 airlines reduced flight frequencies to the country,

cancelling 32 flights per week during the Northern

hemisphere summer season in 2019. Accordingly,

total air passenger movements through the

Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) declined

by 8.3 per cent to 9.9 million in comparison to 10.8

million in 2018. In the meantime, cargo movements

also declined by 8.2 per cent to 246,406 MT from

268,496 MT recorded in the previous year. The

BIA handled 71,973 aircraft movements in 2019,

registering a decline of 3.4 per cent. Subsequent

to the Easter Sunday attacks, the government

offered several incentives to airlines to encourage

their operations to Sri Lanka without disruption.

Incentives were offered on fuel and ground

handling, while reducing the disembarkation levy

for passengers. However, airlines reinstated their

original flight schedules sooner than expected,

towards the latter part of 2019. Meanwhile, the

Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA)

and Jaffna International Airport (JIA) recorded 786

and 64 aircraft movements, respectively, in 2019.

In response to reduced tourist arrivals, domestic

passenger movements also registered a decline of

33 per cent to 20,584 in 2019 as against to 30,725

recorded in the previous year.

As per the provisional unaudited financial

statements, SriLankan Airlines (SLA) recorded an

operating loss of Rs. 33.1 billion for the 2018/2019

financial year. In the 2019/2020 financial year, SLA

incurred an operating loss of Rs. 15.0 billion for the

nine months ending December 2019 according to the

provisional financial statements. The Easter Sunday

attacks imposed significant challenges on the

execution of SLA’s short and medium term strategies

of its business plan. A series of flight cancellations

and aircraft downgrades were accommodated

in the schedule for the four months following the

attacks due to a reduction in the passenger volume.

Despite the decline in income, SLA was able to

reduce operating expenditure due to low fuel prices

and fuel optimisation initiatives. The airline’s online

direct sales channel increased its contribution to the

overall revenue up to 16 per cent, making substantial

savings in distribution costs. Meanwhile, in May 2019,

SLA was named the world’s most punctual airline for

the second time. By end 2019, SLA had a fleet of 26

airbus aircraft with 13 each from wide-bodied and

narrow-bodied categories.

Construction work related to several

aviation development projects continued in

2019. The Palaly Airport was upgraded and was

renamed as the Jaffna International Airport (JIA)

in October 2019. Meanwhile, feasibility studies

and environmental impact assessments were in

progress for the construction of the Bandarawela

Airport. Development activities were in progress

to upgrade the Batticaloa Airport and Ratmalana

Airport as international airports. With the recent

developments of regional airports and their

transformation into international airports, Sri Lanka

will have five international airports, located in

Katunayake, Ratmalana, Mattala, Batticaloa and

Jaffna.

The Cabinet of Ministers approved the

National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP) in 2019.

This new policy framework proposes to open

up Sri Lanka’s sky for international commercial

traffic on the basis of reciprocity with the objective

of enhancing accessibility and connectivity.

Accordingly, the NCAP aims to grant permission

for new local airlines to conduct international air

services as scheduled airlines while allowing local

airlines to conduct charter operations to international

destinations. The NCAP encourages foreign airlines

to conduct similar charter operations to Sri Lanka.

The NCAP is also expected to introduce multiple

ground handling service providers at airports and to

construct new domestic aerodromes to encourage

domestic air operations.

Port Services

Port related activities witnessed an

expansion during 2019, primarily due to the

growth of commercial operations at the Colombo

International Container Terminal (CICT) in the

Port of Colombo. The Port of Colombo handled

7.2 million Twenty-foot Equivalent Container Units

(TEUs) during 2019 in comparison to 7 million

TEUs handled in the corresponding period in 2018,

despite a 3.1 per cent drop in ship arrivals to 4,198

vessels in 2019. The volume of transshipment

container handling, including restowing, accounted

for 82.4 per cent of total container volume in the

Port of Colombo, recording a growth of 4.4 per cent

during 2019 over the previous year. The expansion

in transshipment operations in 2019 could be largely

attributed to the expansion of activities at the CICT.

However, container handling for domestic purposes

registered a decline of 5.2 per cent during the period

under review. The overall performance of the Port

of Colombo in terms of container, transshipment

and cargo handling, witnessed a growth of

2.6 per cent, 3.6 per cent and 1.8 per cent,

respectively, in 2019 compared to 2018. The

CICT, which is equipped with robust infrastructure

facilities to handle large vessels, handled a total of

2.9 million TEUs during 2019 recording a 8.1 per cent

growth in its throughput compared to the previous

year. The increased performance of the CICT

was achieved mainly by capitalising on its higher

capacity, especially its deep draught facilities, which

are not available in other terminals at the Port of

Colombo, and the availability of modern equipment

to handle mega container vessels. Meanwhile,

total container handling at South Asia Gateway

Terminal (SAGT) recorded a marginal drop of

0.7 per cent in 2019 compared to the previous year.

Accordingly, total container handling at SAGT was

2.1 million TEUs. Meanwhile, terminals operated

by the Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA), including

the Jaya Container Terminal (JCT), registered a

marginal decline in container handling of one per

cent to 2.3 million TEUs during 2019. Accordingly,

the CICT, the SLPA and the SAGT accounted for

40 per cent, 31.6 per cent and 28.4 per cent of

the total volume of containers handled by the Port

of Colombo, respectively, in 2019. Meanwhile,

transshipment container handling at the CICT

and the SLPA witnessed an increase of 12.5

per cent and 1.6 per cent, respectively, during the

year. However, transshipment container handling

at the SAGT registered a negative growth of 2.1

per cent in 2019. Cargo handling at the Port of

Colombo registered a growth of 1.8 per cent in

2019. While cargo handling at the SLPA and the

SAGT witnessed contractions of 2.3 per cent and

1.9 per cent, respectively, the CICT recorded

a growth of 9.4 per cent during the year. At the

Asian Freight, Logistics and Supply Chain (AFLAS)

Awards, the CICT was voted as the Best Container

Terminal in Asia in the ‘under 4 million TEUs

category’ for the third consecutive year in 2019.

The CICT remains the first and the only deep water

port in South Asia that is capable of handling Ultra

Large Container Carriers (ULCC), which contributed

72 per cent of CICT's container handling volumes.

Further, the SLPA won the Ports Authority of the

Year 2019 Award by the Global Ports Forum (GPF)

for the second consecutive year.

The Port of Hambantota recorded a notable

growth in terms of cargo and vehicle handling

in 2019. In 2019, total cargo handling at the

Port of Hambantota registered a notable growth

of 150.8 per cent to 1.2 million metric tons as

against 0.5 million metric tons recorded in 2018.

Meanwhile, the number of vehicles handled by

the Port of Hambantota recorded a growth of 77.4

per cent to 411,027, largely supported by increased

transshipment vehicle handling, which registered

an expansion of 155.4 per cent to 373,925 during

2019. However, vehicle handling carried out at

the Port of Hambantota for domestic purposes

witnessed a contraction of 56.5 per cent to 37,102

vehicles in 2019 from 85,225 vehicles recorded in

the same period in the previous year. Various policy

measures taken by the government and the Central

Bank to curtail motor vehicles imports in the latter

part of 2018 largely contributed to the slowdown in

vehicle handling for domestic purposes at the Port

of Hambantota.

The government and port related institutions

continued to take measures to improve the

country’s connectivity with the world through

sea transportation while developing the

required infrastructure in major ports in the

country. The Port of Colombo surpassed seven

million TEUs throughput for the second consecutive

year in 2019 and all three container terminals in the

Port of Colombo have been operating at maximum

design capacities in recent years. Since global

shipping lines are increasingly using large ships

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

119

for goods transportation, the limited capacity of the

SLPA-owned terminals and SAGT in handling large

vessels constrained the future growth potential of

the Colombo Port. Therefore, it is important to

expedite the development and operations of the

East Container Terminal (ECT) to expand the

productive capacity of the Port of Colombo and

to maintain its competitiveness within the region

while exploiting emerging market opportunities.

As per the Master Plan of the Colombo Port

Expansion Project, the ECT will have 1,200 metres

long quay wall with 18 metres water depth and a

yard capacity of 2.4 million TEUs. In this regard,

a A Memorandum of Cooperation between the

governments of Sri Lanka, Japan and India was

signed in May 2019. The operations at the ECT

under a public-private partnership are scheduled

to commence in 2020. It is expected that the ECT

will be opened for novel megacarriers, enhancing

the annual container throughput of the Port of

Colombo to become a top 20 container port in the

world. The SLPA has already developed a 440

metres long quay wall, adjacent yard area and

connected facilities of the ECT. Meanwhile, the

night navigation improvement project of the SLPA

continued throughout the year, in collaboration

with the Japan International Cooperation System

(JICS), with the aim of improving navigation

facilities at the Port of Trincomalee. Moreover, the

government, through the SLPA, is in the process

of expanding the Port of Galle as a regional port

for tourism and commercial activities.

The financial performance of the SLPA

improved in 2019. Accordingly, the SLPA

recorded a profit of Rs. 16.2 billion before tax in

2019 compared to a profit of Rs. 8.7 billion recorded

in 2018. Total revenue of the SLPA grew by

5.8 per cent to Rs. 40.8 billion, whereas operating

expenditure also increased by 6 per cent to

Rs. 22.4 billion.

Communication Services

The telecommunication sector activities

continued to improve in 2019 with a further

expansion of telephone and internet

connections as well as value added services.

As at end 2019, total mobile telephone

connections increased to 32.9 million from

32.5 million at end 2018, while fixed wireline

telephone connections increased by 2.4

per cent to 1.2 million connections from the

previous year. The decreasing trend in fixed

wireless connections observed in the preceding

years continued in 2019 as well, recording a

16.8 per cent reduction to 1.1 million connections.

As a result, total fixed line connections declined

by 7.4 per cent compared to the previous year.

With these developments, the fixed telephone

penetration, as measured by connections per 100

persons, and the mobile telephone penetration

stood at 10.5 and 150.8, respectively, by end

2019. Internet connections grew by 26.9 per cent,

and accordingly, internet penetration stood at 61.5

by the end of 2019. Moreover, as a result of the

popularity of mobile phones among people, fixed

telephone penetration remains stagnant in Sri

Lanka, which limits the growth of fixed broadband

effect from 01 December 2019 in telecommunication

services are expected to contribute to the expansion

in the telecommunication sector further.

During the year under review, the government

took numerous initiatives to improve access to

telecommunication and digital infrastructure

with the aim of boosting economic development.

The government continued activities related to the

Sri Lanka Digital Economy Strategy to accelerate

digital adoption across key sectors of the economy

to improve their productivity. Further, along with the

Information and Communication Technology Agency

(ICTA), a National Digital Policy (Sri Lanka’s Digital

Agenda for 2020 – 2025) framework was developed

to support sustainable economic development and

growth. In addition, the Sri Lanka Computer Emergency

Readiness Team (SL-CERT) Coordination Centre,

which is the focal organisation for cyber security

system of the country, initiated the establishment

of a National Cyber Security Operations Centre to

monitor threats to digital government applications

and infrastructure, and conducted national surveys to

assess the cyber security landscape of Sri Lanka.

The Telecommunication Regulatory

Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) and

ICTA continued to support the growth of the

telecommunication sector in 2019. Accordingly,

ICTA continued to implement the Lanka

Government Network 2.0 project, which aims

to connect 860 government locations in a cost

effective and secure manner. The expenditure

on this project was around Rs. 674.9 million

in 2019. ICTA engaged in the creation of a

government big data cluster through the Lanka

Government Cloud 2.0 project and 96 per cent

of physical progress was achieved by end 2019

with an expenditure of Rs. 102.3 million in 2019.

Further, ICTA was engaged in the Employee Trust

Fund Management System project in 2019 with

the view to provide online access to Employee

Trust Fund information to both employees and

employers. Moreover, numerous other projects,

including the Integrated Welfare Management

System, ICT Human Resource Capacity Building

for Government Digital Transformation, National

Spatial Data Infrastructure-Phase (II), Smart

Society and Citizen Capacity Building Project and

Cross Government Digital Document Management

System, were carried out by ICTA in 2019. ICTA

also conducted several training and awareness

programmes for public officials on digitalisation

of the country in 2019. In addition, under the

Industry Development Programme of ICTA, a

Process Management IT-BPM Workforce Survey

was carried out to analyse the demand and supply

of the ICT workforce in Sri Lanka. The TRCSL also

implemented several development projects to support

the growth of the telecommunication sector. The

Colombo Lotus Tower, which acts as a hub station

for telecommunication networks, was declared open

in September 2019. The TRCSL also assessed the

possibility of developing a Telecommunication Media

Centre at the Hambantota IT Park, on a public-private

partnership basis.

The performance of the Department of Posts

(DOP) remained stagnant, emphasising the need

for productivity improvement, diversification

of services and technological advancement to

provide better services. As at end 2019, Sri Lanka’s

postal system consists of 653 main post offices, 3,409

sub post offices, 307 agency post offices, 101 rural

agency post offices and 4 estate agency post offices.

The financial performance of the DOP continued

to be weak as in the recent past years. As per the

provisional financial statements, the total revenue of

the DOP increased by 8.9 per cent to Rs. 8.4 billion

in 2019, while operating expenditure also increased

by 6.4 per cent to Rs. 13.7 billion, resulting in an

operating loss of Rs. 5.3 billion in 2019 in comparison

to the loss of Rs. 5.2 billion in 2018. In the meantime,

initial steps were taken by the DOP to implement a

Business Development Plan for 2019 – 2023 with

the aim of providing efficient and high quality public

service in a cost effective way. However, postal

services were disrupted during 2019 due to trade

union actions conducted by postal employees. The

DOP needs to pursue new initiatives that include

policy reforms for cost reductions, well structured

pricing mechanisms to enhance its revenue, and

expansion and diversification of the services in line

with international postal services using advanced

technologies such as bar codes to sort, track and

trace mails and parcels.

Water Supply and Irrigation

The water supply sector continued to expand

its services to meet the rising demand for pipe

borne water in the country. The National Water

Supply and Drainage Board (NWS&DB) provided

108,850 new water supply connections during

the year, reaching 2.4 million total connections by

end 2019. Access to safe drinking water and pipe

born water have thus increased to 91.9 per cent

and 51.8 per cent, respectively, by end 2019 from

90.6 per cent and 50.5 per cent, respectively, by end

2018. With these developments, the total number

of water connections increased by 4.7 per cent in

2019 compared to the previous year. Meanwhile,

the percentage of island wide nonrevenue water

usage increased marginally to 25 per cent in

2019, from 24.9 per cent in 2018. Further, the

percentage of nonrevenue water in the Colombo

city declined to 40.6 per cent in 2019, from 41.7

per cent in 2018. The NWS&DB initiated Giridara

water supply project in the Western Province and

Kirama - Katuwana water supply project in the

Southern Province with the objective of providing

safe drinking water and sanitation services.

The Giridara water supply project is a Rs. 513

million locally funded project aimed at providing

potable water to Giridara and surrounding areas

that are suffering due to water scarcity. The

Kirama - Katuwana water supply project is a euro

10.45 million project that is implemented with

foreign financial assistance, and upon completion,

it is expected to increase the service coverage in

the Divisional Secretary areas of Walasmulla and

Katuwana.

The NWS&DB incurred an operating loss of

Rs. 2.1 billion in 2019 in comparison to a loss

of Rs. 1.8 billion in the previous year. Total

revenue grew by 5.1 per cent to Rs. 26.1 billion

mainly due to the increased number of connections

provided during the year, while operational and

maintenance costs increased by 6.3 per cent to

Rs. 29.4 billion. Further, the NWS&DB incurred

capital expenditure of Rs. 73.2 billion, which is

an increase of 18.7 per cent in comparison to the

previous year. Water tariffs have not been revised

since October 2012.

Amidst some flagship initiatives, the

Department of Irrigation (DI) made concerted

efforts towards maintaining and upgrading

irrigation projects for agriculture and

domestic purposes in 2019. The Heda Oya

reservoir project was commenced with the aim

of irrigating 5,303 hectares providing facilities to

50,000 families. Further, rehabilitation of feeder

tanks under the Giant’s tank project was also

commenced to irrigate 9,894 hectares benefiting

10,625 families. During the year, 24 existing major

irrigation projects were in progress incurring a cost

of Rs. 6,564.4 million, of which Rs. 4,263.3 million

and Rs. 514.5 million were spent on the Yan Oya

and Kalugaloya reservoirs, respectively. The

Climate Resilience Improvement Project (CRIP),

which was inaugurated in 2014 to implement

adverse climate shock resilience improvements

in hydraulic infrastructure, progressed across

21 major irrigation schemes in nine regions up to

end 2019. The approved estimated cost of the CRIP

is Rs. 5,374.4 million, of which Rs. 3,736.7 million

was spent by end 2019. Meanwhile, Rs. 2,153.4

million was spent under CRIP - Additional Financing

covering 22 major irrigation schemes in 11 regions

by the end of 2019. The Uma Oya downstream

development project achieved physical progress

of 85 per cent at end 2019 and four reservoirs

under the Uma Oya project, namely Alikota Ara,

Diaraba, Puhulpola and Handapanagala, were

vested in the public in October 2019. Under the

Productivity Enhancement and Irrigation System

Efficiency Improvement project (PEISEIP), which

was initiated in 2017 to improve the irrigation

infrastructure for 72,882 hectares of irrigable

lands benefiting 97,832 farmer families, activities

related to 40 major and 40 medium irrigation

schemes were commenced in 14 districts by

end 2019. The numerous social, economic,

ecological and geological flaws that were

observed in relation to recent irrigation projects

highlight the importance of conducting required

comprehensive environmental assessments prior

to the implementation of such activities.

3.3 Social Infrastructure Policies,

Institutional Framework and Performance

Health

The government continued to invest in

human and physical resources in the state

health sector during the year. Numerous

physical infrastructure development projects

including construction of the drug rehabilitation

centre in Divisional Hospital in Minuwangoda,

the alcohol rehabilitation centres in Rambukkana

and Athurugiriya, and child psychiatry unit in

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

123

Base Hospital in Diyathalawa were completed

in 2019. Further, construction of nephrology

units in major hospitals, such as the teaching

hospitals in Peradeniya and Karapitiya, was in

progress. Meanwhile, the project to remodel the

existing building and construct a new three-storey

building at the new District General Hospital in

Kamburugamuwa continued during 2019 with the

aim of expanding and relocating maternal and new

born care facilities in Matara. As per the provisional

health sector data, there were 603 government

hospitals with 3.6 beds for every 1,000 persons

in the country by end 2019. Meanwhile, there was

one qualified doctor for every 1,203 persons and

one nurse for every 570 persons in state hospitals

at the end of the year. Further, there were 105

government Ayurvedic hospitals consisting of 4,485

beds by end 2019, and 1,759 qualified doctors

working in government Ayurvedic hospitals.

In 2019, Sri Lanka made significant

achievements in terms of managing several

communicable diseases, though the country

remains vulnerable to several regularly

occurring endogenous epidemics and potential

cross-border transmission of global health

hazards. During the year, the World Health

Organisation (WHO) declared that Sri Lanka is

free of mother to child transmission of the Human

Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Syphilis. Sri

Lanka has not reported any case of mother-to-child

transmission of HIV since 2017, while the country’s

congenital Syphilis cases have consistently been

two per 100,000 live births, which is substantially

lower than the 50 per 100,000 live births level that

is required to be eligible for elimination certification.

Sri Lanka is the third country in the region to achieve

this status after Thailand and Maldives. Meanwhile,

the WHO affirmed that Sri Lanka has eliminated

endogenous Measles and has controlled Rubella.

Within the region, Sri Lanka was the fourth country

to eliminate Measles and control Rubella. However,

the Dengue epidemic intensified towards the end of

2019 recording 105,049 cases for the year, which

corresponds to an annual incidence rate of 482 per

100,000 population compared to 238 per 100,000

population in the previous year. Meanwhile, 50

per cent of the case load was reported in the fourth

quarter of the year. The government implemented

numerous activities to minimise and control the

burden of Dengue through early diagnosis and

proactive case management during the past

years. As a result, the case fatality rate remained

at a lower level of 0.15 per cent. The number of

Leptospirosis cases also increased in 2019,

recording 6,021 cases for the year, in comparison

to 5,257 cases in the preceding year. The fatality

rate associated with Leptospirosis was 1.68

per cent. The highest caseload was reported from

the Ratnapura, Kalutara, Galle and Matara Districts.

As in 2018, two peaks of seasonal influenza were

observed during 2019. The first peak was observed

from May to July, and the second was noticed from

October to December. The highest number of cases

of Influenza Like Illnesses (ILI) was reported in the

month of November. Meanwhile, ILI represented

two per cent of the total Out Patient Department

(OPD) visits to the sentinel surveillance sites. There

were 50 deaths reported due to influenza during

2019. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 outbreak that

emerged in China at end December 2019 turned

into a pandemic by March 2020. With mounting

worries over the cross-border transmission of

the disease to Sri Lanka, disease surveillance

at entry points to the country such as BIA, and

quarantine programmes were strengthened. Thirty

three students who were studying in Wuhan city in

China, the epicentre of the illness, were evacuated

and quarantined at the Diyathalawa army base

though none of them reported contracting the virus.

Quarantine centres were established in several

locations including Kandakadu, Punani, Diyatalawa,

and Rantembe. Since 10 March 2020, all air

passengers arriving from high risk countries such

as Italy, Iran and South Korea, were quarantined

at these designated quarantine centres. Further,

travel bans were imposed on people arriving

from high risk countries, including South Korea,

Iran and European countries. All the international

airports were closed for operations of inbound

international commercial passenger flights from

19 March 2020. Further, the on-arrival visa system

was also suspended in March 2020 in view of the

escalating number of COVID-19 patients globally.

Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign

Employment imposed a restriction on Sri Lankans

leaving for foreign employment as a measure of

extending cooperation towards certain countries

which had already imposed entry restrictions due

to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Schools, private

tuition classes, Sunday schools and universities

were closed temporarily to prevent the spread of

the disease within the country. Self-quarantining

and social distancing measures were strictly

implemented to curb the spread of COVID-19. A

total of 24 government hospitals across the island

were equipped to meet the emergency condition

treatments while 12 hospitals were on standby to

accommodate suspected patients of COVID-19.

Meanwhile, 53 imported Malaria cases were

reported in 2019 although Sri Lanka has been

declared as a country free of indigenous Malaria.

These recent developments highlight the danger

of transmission of global epidemics to Sri Lanka

and a possible resurgence of already contained

communicable diseases in the country such as

Malaria and Measles.

The government continued its efforts

to prevent and control acute and chronic

non-communicable diseases (NCDs) that are

burdening the economy. According to the WHO,

NCDs are estimated to account for 83 per cent of

all deaths in the country and the risk of premature

deaths due to NCDs is 17 per cent. NCDs cause

a significant socio-economic burden on individuals,

families and the overall economy due to the

resultant morbidity and mortality issues. Cardio

vascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory

disease and diabetes, account for 34 per cent,

14 per cent, eight per cent and nine per cent of the

deaths in the country, respectively. Hence, these

four NCDs collectively contribute to almost two

thirds of deaths in Sri Lanka. According to a report

published in 2020 by the World Bank and UNICEF

in collaboration with several other organisations,

the share of NCDs in aggregate Disability Adjusted

Life Years1 (DALYs) in Sri Lanka has risen from

53 per cent in 1990 to 77 per cent in 2017.

Meanwhile, the total DALYs due to NCDs have

increased by 36 per cent. Therefore, the government

carried out various risk reduction programmes

to address modifiable risk factors (tobacco,

alcohol, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity) and

1 DALY is a measurement of the number of lost years of healthy life. The sum of the DALYs across the population indicate the overall disease burden in the economy and is a measurement of the gap between current health status of the population and an ideal health situation in which the entire population lives to an advanced age, free of disabilities and diseases.

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

125

metabolic risk factors (high blood pressure, high

blood sugar, high blood cholesterol) associated with

major NCDs. In this regard, health education and

health promotion programmes were conducted at

schools, work and community settings on NCD risk

factors and importance of early detection of NCDs.

Further, guidelines on physical activity and dietary

guidelines for selected chronic NCDs, such as heart

disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, chronic

kidney disease (CKD), rheumatologic diseases,

chronic respiratory diseases, and obesity, as well

as guidelines for primary healthcare providers on

diabetes, overweight, obesity and salt reduction

strategy were prepared and disseminated during

2019. Meanwhile, CKD prevalence in the country

was recorded at 0.94 per cent in 2019, with the

highest number of CKD patients being reported

from the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa Districts.

CKD patients are required to register at one

of the 77 state institutions that provide dialysis

facilities. Accordingly, 454 dialysis machines

were functioning in state hospitals by end 2019.

The base hospital in Homagama and the District

General Hospital in Negombo started functioning

as new dialysis units in 2019. According to the

International Agency for Research on Cancer of

the WHO, the risk of developing cancer and risk

of dying due to cancer before turning 75 years are

9.1 per cent and 5.5 per cent, respectively, in Sri

Lanka. The government conducted awareness

programmes on cancer prevention and early

detection in 17 districts and carried out capacity

building and training programmes for healthcare

personnel on prevention and screening of high

risk individuals. Further, machines and equipment

for cancer treatment were provided to cancer

treatment centres, including the Apeksha hospital

in Maharagama.

The private sector in healthcare service

delivery continued to be significant during 2019.

The number of registered Western medicine private

hospitals at end 2019 was 207 with a total bed

capacity of 5,147. There were 194 full time private

general practices/ dispensaries/ medical clinics,

181 private medical centres/ screening centres/

day care medical centres/ channel consultations,

413 private medical laboratories, 394 part time

private general practices/ dispensaries/ medical

clinics, 20 part time private dental surgeries and

10 private medical ambulance services registered

as at end 2019. Although the government’s efforts

to provide universal access to free healthcare

services have continued, fiscal constraints and the

increasing aging population limit the availability of

resources in the state sector healthcare institutions,

while preference for the private sector health care

solutions is rising given the rise in income levels

of the population. Hence, creating a conducive

environment for private sector investment in the

health sector, strong regulation and monitoring

mechanism for quality assurance, and promotion

of health insurance schemes are essential to meet

the country’s healthcare demand. With the growing

elderly population, rising incidence of NCDs and

increasing household income levels, investment

in geriatric and palliative care by the private sector

should be promoted further, since state hospitals

are not sufficiently equipped to handle the mounting

healthcare requirements of all elderly people.

Education

During 2019, the government continued its

efforts to enhance infrastructure and human

resources in the general education system

with the view of providing equitable access

to education for all children. Accordingly,

infrastructure development activities, such as

building new classrooms, laboratories, libraries

etc. were carried out during the year under

review, incurring a total expenditure of Rs. 12.9

billion through the budget for the Nearest School

is the Best School programme and the Ministry

of Education (MOE)’s annual budget. Since the

introduction of the Nearest School is the Best School

policy, 13,995 infrastructure development activities

in provincial schools and 2,312 such activities in

national schools were commenced. By end 2019,

the shares of completed activities in provincial

schools and national schools were 86 per cent and

68 per cent, respectively. Meanwhile, 6,389

teachers were recruited in 2019, of which 3,411 were

deployed in provincial schools. Further, teacher

evaluations were carried out in 8,500 schools by the

MOE, provincial Departments of Education, zonal

and divisional education offices to ensure the quality

of teaching.

Various steps were taken by the government

in 2019 to improve Science, Technology,

Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and

vocational education offered by schools. In

this regard, curriculum development activities

and preparation of additional teaching resources

were in progress during the period under review.

Meanwhile, the government, in collaboration with

the National Institute of Education (NIE), conducted

an advanced course for teaching mathematics

for 100 non mathematics teachers, while offering

continuous professional development programmes

for 900 secondary education teachers and 91

combined mathematics teachers. Further, 100 newly

recruited ICT teachers were trained at the NIE, and

another 30 teachers were trained by the ICT Branch

of the MOE on computer programming languages

and databases during 2019. In addition, 114 master

trainers were trained during 2019 on internet safety

readiness. These master trainers are expected to

train other teachers in their respective zones to

handle cyber related incidents. Further, teacher

training programmes on robotics were conducted

for teachers of Engineering Technology, and Design

and Technology. Meanwhile, the number of students

enrolled in the Technology stream at the General

Certificate of Education Advanced Level (G.C.E.

A/L) examination has gradually increased since the

introduction of this stream in 2013. Accordingly, the

technology stream was offered in 447 schools and

19,750 students were newly enrolled in this study

stream in 2019. During the year under review, the

government, in partnership with Korea International

Cooperation Agency (KOICA), commenced

construction of a new National College of Education

for the technology stream in the Kurunegala District.

Further, 1,000 scholarships have been offered

to students of low income families who follow the

technology stream for G.C.E. A/L based on the

General Certificate of Education Ordinary Level

(G.C.E. O/L) examination results. Meanwhile, stage

three of the 13 years of guaranteed education

programme was in progress in 2019. During the

year under review, 120 ICT teachers were trained

in National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) 3 and

4 levels of Computer Hardware and Network

curriculum under this programme.

Although private sector participation in

general education provision is rising, regulatory

and monitoring mechanisms related to private

and international schools, thus far, remain weak.

There were 118 government approved private

schools (excluding international schools) and 796

pirivenas by end 2019. The number of students

enrolled in private schools (excluding international

3

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

127

schools) and pirivenas in 2019 amounted to 139,070

and 64,802, respectively. These government

approved private schools are under the purview of

the MOE and hence, are bound to follow the general

education policies of the government. In 2019, there

were 389 international schools providing general

education to 140,223 students. As per the MOE,

only seven of these schools are registered under

the BOI and the rest were registered as companies

under the Companies Act. Meanwhile, there were

numerous religious institutions that provide general

schooling to students.2 For example, there were

1,495 madrasa schools3 and 317 Arabic colleges

2 Excluding religious schools conducted by temples, churches and mosques during weekends to provide only religious education.3 This number excludes the madrasas conducted only during weekends.

registered under the Department of Muslim

Religious and Cultural Affairs by end February 2020.

However, due to the weaknesses in the current legal

framework, these international schools and religious

schools do not come under the purview of the MOE.

Hence, the MOE does not have any mechanism to

monitor the number of students enrolled, curricula

taught in these schools, quality standards and

whether the students of these schools are evaluated

through acceptable competitive examinations.

Considering the increasing number of students

seeking education through the private sector, the

legal framework and the monitoring mechanism

related to private general education institutions

need to be strengthened to ensure that the students

from these schools are equipped with knowledge

and skills necessary for a productive adulthood and

to ensure value for money of the education services

offered by these schools.

The government, in collaboration with the

private sector, continued its efforts to increase

access to tertiary education through state and non

state higher education institutions. The selection

of students for degree programmes and release of

cut-off marks were finalised in July 2019, based on the

results of the G.C.E. A/L examination held in August

2018. Accordingly, 30,830 students were selected

for government universities, excluding the additional

and special intakes. During the 2018/19 academic

year, two new courses of study were introduced.

Meanwhile, five faculties, 47 new departments, two

undergraduate degree programmes, one external

degree programme, five undergraduate specialised

degrees and 34 postgraduate programmes were

newly approved by the University Grants Commission

(UGC). Further, the UGC provided financial

assistance to permanent members of academic

staff of Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) that

are under its purview, enabling them to read for

Master’s and Doctoral degree (PhD) programmes.

Accordingly, Rs.75 million was approved by the UGC

for 14 applicants to read for their PhDs. Meanwhile,

the Quality Assurance Council (QAC) of the UGC was

engaged with the universities for internal and external

quality assurance activities. Accordingly, the QAC

continued to work closely with the internal quality

assurance units (IQAUs) in all 15 universities under

the UGC. By the third quarter of 2019, 11 IQAUs had

met the target of the Accelerating Higher Education

Expansion and Development (AHEAD) programme.

With regard to external quality assurance activities,

the QAC received self-evaluation reports from four

universities for institutional reviews in 2019. The QAC

completed one site visit in December 2019. A new

website for the QAC was developed and launched in

mid-2019 with regular updates of resource materials

from training workshops, reports on external reviews,

UGC circulars and publications pertaining to QA,

and other relevant news and events. The UGC took

steps to create a centralised grievance handling

mechanism primarily to address issues related to

ragging and sexual and gender based violence

(SGBV). Accordingly, complaints can be lodged via

hotline, online, emails, in person and in written form.

Further, the UGC introduced the Emergency Safety

Mobile Application, with the support of ICTA, to be

used by students and university staff in an emergency

situation to alert the Vice-Chancellor, senior

management and others concerned for immediate

action and to seek help from them. Ragging and

SGBV incidents have a notable implication on

the smooth functioning of the university system

causing delays in student intakes and graduations,

and disruptions to academic programmes. Further,

such incidents discourage potential new entrants

to the university system and thereby affect tertiary

enrolment rates. Repercussions of such incidents

are mainly felt by students of low-income households

since they cannot afford alternative tertiary education

options through Non-State Higher Education

Institutions (NSHEIs). Hence, all stakeholders,

including students, academic and non-academic staff

and student unions, should make a collective effort

to prevent such incidents within the state university

system, in order to retain the competitiveness of

the state universities amidst the rising demand for

private NSHEIs. In this regard, the recent efforts by

the government to decisively address the incidence

of ragging are commendable and must be continued.

Given the limited opportunities available in the

state university system, the private sector higher

education institions also play a critical role in

meeting the dynamic labour market demands in

the economy. Accordingly, there were 18 NSHEIs

offering 146 degree programmes by end 2019. The

degree programmes cover a range of education

fields, including human resource management, ICT,

business administration, engineering, and nano and

advanced technologies. In June 2019, the Higher

Education (Quality Assurance and Accreditation

Commission) Bill was gazetted and was forwarded

to relevant stakeholders for their comments and

observations. Meanwhile, the Cabinet of Ministers

granted approval to obtain new proposals from

NSHEIs for STEM+A subjects, where A refers to

Arts subjects. The aim of this new proposal is to

increase STEM graduates while allowing students

to enhance their STEM learning through the

integration of Arts in a non-traditional manner. This

will also allow the Arts students to enhance their

employability by incorporating STEM subjects into

their curricula. Meanwhile, a considerable number of

student emigrations occur every year through private

education agents though the activities of these

agents are not been monitored by the government.

Recent deaths of some students in Azerbaijan and

students stranded in foreign countries due to the

COVID-19 pandemic underscore the importance of

monitoring the student movements to other countries

by the government.

In 2019, the Technical and Vocational

Education and Training (TVET) sector continued

to support the youth in developing their skills

thereby facilitating upskilling of the existing

labour force. There were 1,290 registered institutions

in the TVET sector by end 2019 comprising

582 public institutions and 708 private and non-

government sector institutions. These institutions

offered 2,691 accredited TVET courses covering a

wide array of technical and vocational subject areas.

The public TVET institutions introduced 15 new

courses under seven fields, including ICT, electronic

and telecommunication, mechatronic technology,

building construction, metal and light engineering

technology and tourism. The state sector TVET

institutions newly enrolled 35,599 students to

TVET courses during 2019. Under the 13 years of

Guaranteed Education Programme, 798 students

were recruited for graphic designing, construction,

web designing, automobile and electrical courses

offered by the state sector Colleges of Technology

and Technical Colleges. During the year under

review, 78,007 NVQ certificates were issued in the

TVET sector, of which 33,483 were received by

females. The number of NVQ certificates issued

by the private sector during the year amounted to

27,792. Meanwhile, the government, in collaboration

with the Department of Technical Education

and Training, conducted numerous awareness

programmes, career guidance and open-day

programmes to educate students, school leavers,

parents and teachers on the opportunities available

through TVET. Several programmes were conducted

targeting disadvantaged persons and women to

encourage their enrolment in the TVET sector while

introducing an incentive scheme for enrolment

and job placement for female TVET graduates in

non- traditional and emerging sectors. Further,

several awareness programmes were conducted

on the Self- Employment Promotion Initiative (SEPI)

loan scheme for vocational trainees and students

to support and encourage entrepreneurship.

Nevertheless, more concerted efforts are needed

to popularise the TVET sector among school

leavers since they have the potential to be the most

productive segment in the labour force. Hence,

offering more job-oriented courses with internships

within the industry can attract more school leavers to

the TVET sector.

Introduction

Many countries which grew out of ‘poor country’ status fairly easily experience a slowdown in economic growth once they reach the middle income stage. On the one hand, these countries are unable to compete with low wage, poor economies who have labour intensive, imitation driven merchandise export sectors. Conversely, they also fail to compete with advanced economies that export innovation driven manufactured goods produced using highly productive skilled labour. As a result, these middle income countries do not make a timely transition from resource led growth to productivity driven growth, and this phenomenon is termed the ‘middle income trap’. Escaping the middle income trap is challenging for Sri Lanka as well, but is crucial for the country to achieve a sustainable, high growth path.

As per the World Bank classification, Sri Lanka surpassed the lower middle income threshold in 1997, but 21 years lapsed until the country was elevated to the upper middle income status. If the country grows at a 5 per cent annual growth rate,1 Sri Lanka may require another 22-23 years to transcend to a high income nation. Therefore, Sri Lanka could be caught in a ‘middle income trap’ for over 40 years, unless growth focused structural reforms and strategies are urgently implemented alongside policies for macroeconomic stability that are essential for sustainable high economic growth.

Although there are numerous factors that are vital to ensure high economic growth at the middle income stage, a sound education system is always of paramount importance to accumulate human capital and thereby raise a country’s competitiveness. A good education system equips the labour force with marketable skills while spurring innovations and productivity growth. Often, public investment in a country is aimed at improving the general level of education. For example, Sri Lanka adopted an education policy to offer free education at primary, secondary and tertiary levels in 1945, and today the country enjoys an impressively high literacy rate among both males (93.4 per cent in 2018) and females (91.6 per cent in 2018). Although increasing literacy levels are important for the country to move ahead of the regional peers in terms of human development; as Figure B 9.1 depicts, the country still lags behind in terms of innovation and competitiveness, factors which are core to accelerate economic growth during the middle income stage.

1 The annual GDP growth rate of Sri Lanka has been at or below 5 per cent since 2013.

BOX 7Education Reforms to Break Free from the Middle Income Trap

With economic development, skills requirements in an economy also evolve over time. Therefore, education policies and investments need to be dynamically adjusted to align with the evolving skills requirements of the economy, in order to achieve simultaneous progress in human and economic development. If the education system is not aligned with the economic growth needs, the country will face persistent skills gaps and mismatches hindering further economic growth. Persistent skills gaps and mismatches can hamper economic growth in three ways: first, firms will not be able to expand their operations and compete in global markets without the required skilled labour; second, firms will be restricted to lower rungs of global value chains as they fail to upgrade their technologies; third, lack of skilled labour will discourage foreign direct investment inflows. Countries such as Singapore and South Korea, which successfully evaded the middle income trap, have implemented major education sector reforms from time to time and phased in public education investments to align their education system with the needs of the evolving economy. For example, from 1965 to 1978, Singapore’s education policies were striving to provide universal access to primary and secondary education and enhance technical skills that are essential for labour intensive production. But with the intensifying competition for labour intensive exports from their regional peers, during the 1980s, Singapore focused on equipping the labour force with skills that are needed for capital intensive production. Since the 1990s, Singapore has gradually transformed into a knowledge based economy. In parallel, the country’s education policies refocused on strengthening tertiary education by establishing new universities, building partnerships with foreign universities and improving labour productivity through innovation. However, replication of the education system reforms of these successful countries within the Sri Lankan economy may not be feasible without suitable adjustments, since many socio-economic factors in Sri Lanka, such as the level of human development, structure

of the economy, culture and fiscal space for education spending, vastly differ from those of such countries. Hence, Sri Lanka today is at a critical juncture where the education sector needs to be reassessed in consideration of the economic structure, persistent skills gaps and mismatches as well as future growth potential, and education policies and reforms should be aligned with the country’s economic development goals in order to escape the middle income trap.

Issues in the Sri Lankan Education System

Higher Education

Although successive governments have striven to provide free university education to students, limited resources available in the university system obstruct higher education opportunities for a majority of the youth. In 2018, the gross tertiary enrolment rate in Sri Lanka was merely 19.6 per cent. The average gross tertiary enrolment rate in upper middle income countries and lower middle income countries stood at 53.0 per cent and 24.8 per cent, respectively, in 2018, suggesting that Sri Lanka lags far behind than an average lower middle income country in terms of tertiary education enrolment.

With economic development, a country needs to adopt advanced technologies to remain competitive within global markets. To this end, the country should have a highly skilled labour force, particularly a bank of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) literate employees. Although overall literacy rates that capture only the reading and writing ability are high in Sri Lanka, the level of STEM literacy in the country is not adequate to achieve an innovation led growth. The graduate output of the public university system in Sri Lanka is more biased towards Arts and Humanities subjects and less towards STEM fields. In 2018, the percentage of university students enrolled in STEM fields for undergraduate studies was 14.8 per cent. As indicated in Table B 9.1, the share of student enrolment in STEM fields in Sri Lanka is lower than in industrialised countries and other middle income countries.

The disconnect between tertiary student enrolment and the labour demand is evident from the employment rates among the graduates. According to the Tracer Study of Graduates conducted by the University Grant Commission in 2016/2017, unemployment rates among graduates of state universities in the fields of Performing Arts, Arts and Management are 57.1 per cent, 50.4 per cent and 27.7 per cent, respectively, even after 2-3 years of graduation, indicating a mismatch of skills with the labour market demand. On the other hand, graduates from STEM fields such as Allied Health Science, Engineering, Science and Agriculture have reported higher employment rates of 95.7 per cent, 92.2 per cent, 83.0 per cent and 82.6 per cent, respectively. While there is an excess supply of non-STEM graduates from universities, skill gaps are persistent in certain fields in the job market. For example, according to the ICT/BPM workforce survey -2019 conducted by the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA), the demand for IT graduates have increased from 6,246 in 2014 to 21,216 by 2019, although the supply of total IT graduates has increased only to 12,307 in 2018, indicating a widening skill gap in the IT field.

Universities are expected not only to disseminate knowledge, but also to be forerunners in creating new knowledge through research activities. Knowledge created through research can be transformed into real world applications for technological enhancements and productivity improvements. However, the applicability and intensity of research work done by tertiary education institutions are substantially low since both state and non-state degree providing institutions mainly focus on teaching rather than on research. Due to the low research intensity in the country, Sri Lanka was ranked at the 75th position in the Citable Documents H index3 in 2019, compared to China, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, Indonesia, Vietnam and Bangladesh which were ranked at 13th, 21st, 43rd, 50th, 55th, 57th and 63rd positions, respectively. Meanwhile, in 2018, the number of patent applications by residents in Sri Lanka was 15 applications per one million population. However, countries such as China, Singapore and Malaysia are far ahead of Sri Lanka, recording 1,000 patent applications, 276 patent applications and 35 patent applications per one million population, respectively.

General Education

Lower levels of student enrolment in STEM fields at the tertiary level are a reflection of the student enrolment patterns at the upper secondary (Advanced Level) stage and poor student performance in mathematics and science at both upper secondary and lower secondary (Ordinary Level) stage (Figures B 9.2 and B 9.3). In 2018, 32 per cent of the school applicants at the G.C.E O/L examination either failed or conditionally passed

the examination as a result of failing mathematics. A majority of such students will drop out from school and will be curtailed from receiving further education since mathematics is a prerequisite for most higher education programmes. Where science education is concerned, according to the School Census – 2017 conducted by the Census and Statistics Department, out of 10,194 schools in the country, 2,847 schools offer A/L classes of which only 1,029 schools have the science stream (i.e. 36 per cent of the schools with A/L classes). There are significant regional disparities in terms of availability of science A/L classes. For example, of the schools with A/L classes, the percentage of schools with the A/L science stream in Central, North Western, Uva and North Central provinces was as low as 26 per cent, 29 per cent, 29 per cent and 33 per cent, respectively. This legacy issue in general education is translated into non-STEM biased programme choices at the university level.

Meanwhile, with the increasing globalisation, technological advancements and service oriented nature of the country, English literacy has become a key determinant of the employability of a person. According to the World Bank Skills Towards Employment and

Productivity (STEP) survey-2012, 80 per cent of the employers expect the high-skilled workers to possess English language skills while 40 per cent of the employers expect the same from low-skilled workers. However, low pass rates for English language at G.C.E (O/L) indicate the lack of English proficiency among those who enter the labour market.

Poor student performance at the G.C.E. (O/L) examination in science, mathematics and English subjects can be attributed to shortages in skilled teachers4 and teacher deployment issues. Although the availability of science, mathematics and English teachers at the national level exceeds numbers recommended by the Ministry of Education (MOE), skilled teachers in these fields are below the recommended levels for science and mathematics. There are considerable disparities in skilled teacher availability across national and provincial schools as well as across regions indicating the issues in teacher deployment. For example, national schools have more than the required number of science teachers while provincial schools have a shortage. Both national and provincial schools in Western, Central, Southern and North-Western provinces have more than the required number of skilled English teachers, though schools in other provinces experience a dearth of skilled teachers for the subject (Arunatilake and Abayasekara, 2017, pp.16-17).

Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Sector

Since a majority of the students who qualify for university entrance fail to enter universities primarily due to the lack of resources in the university system, the TVET sector is expected to train potential new entrants to the labour market and upskill the existing labour force. However, Sri Lanka’s TVET sector is plagued by a myriad of shortcomings resulting in lower efficiency of the sector in terms of meeting the country’s skill demand. Currently, the TVET sector is highly fragmented and poorly coordinated with a large number of state and non-state education providers (1,290 registered TVET institutions by end 2019), and numerous governing agencies with their own regulatory panels and procedures. Since there is no central planning mechanism for the TVET sector, the designing of training programmes, student enrolment, and quality standards and accreditations are not aligned with the country’s growth policies and labour market needs. Although the National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) system has been introduced with the aim of defining training standards on the basis of occupational requirements, the quality assurance process in the TVET system is still not fully effective since many private TVET institutions are neither accredited nor registered. Meanwhile, the TVET sector

also suffers from the scarcity of qualified training staff, particularly those with industrial experience. In addition, employers’ involvement in designing the courses and delivering training programmes is minimal in most TVET courses, resulting in low relevance of TVET training for employment. Meanwhile, the student demand for TVET is at a subdued level as a result of the social stigma associated with technical jobs as well as lack of knowledge on the employment opportunities for the people with vocational training. Recently there have been attempts to route the youth who fail at the G.C.E O/L examination hurdle to receive NVQ level education through the ‘13 Years of Guaranteed Education’ policy. However, this programme is still at an incipient stage with shortages of qualified staff particularly in rural areas, where the TVET system is most needed.

Way Forward

Sri Lanka’s economic growth has been tepid in recent years, not only due to global and domestic headwinds which are of a transitory nature, but also due to persistent structural obstacles in the economy, such as issues in the labour market. Although past education policies of successive governments have focused on providing universal education opportunities to students, Sri Lanka now must refocus the country’s education policies to align with the economic development goals to become globally competitive and thereby escape the middle income trap. In this regard, emphasis of the education system should be on STEM fields as well as improving English literacy, which are crucial in building linkages with the global markets. Hence, Sri Lanka needs integrated policy reforms at all levels of education in order to build a STEM literate workforce.

At the general education level, education policies should focus on improving the relevance of curricula for economic development goals and quality of education delivery. Meanwhile, the range of education streams at the A/L stage should be widened in all schools while allocating resources and trained staff equitably across schools for STEM subjects and English. Equitable access to STEM and English education is vital to achieve inclusive economic growth. Resource allocation to national schools and provincial schools are primarily made through the Central Government and Provincial Councils, respectively, which inevitably results in large disparities in physical resource allocation and teacher deployment across schools. Hence, resource and teacher cadre requirements and shortages at school level should be monitored through a central database system. Further, the allocation of resources and teacher deployment should be made on a needs basis through a central mechanism. An incentive scheme needs to be introduced for teachers in STEM fields to work in underprivileged schools. Building partnerships with the private sector to enhance digital technology resources in underprivileged schools will not only reduce the digital

divide within the economy, but will also provide a better learning experience for children. This approach has been successfully utilised in other countries to increase access to digital learning.

One of the reasons for lower participation in tertiary education is the limited fiscal space for increasing government expenditure on education. Since the state sector alone cannot meet the skill demand in the economy, private sector engagement in tertiary education, supported by strong quality assurance and accreditation mechanisms, is vital to raise higher education and TVET enrolment rates. Further, concessionary education loans5 should be promoted to encourage students who are unable to enrol in state universities to pursue higher education opportunities through non-state higher education institutions. The education/ training cost per student in STEM fields is generally high, since resources such as laboratories and equipment are costly though the resources may not be fully utilised due to the limited number of students/ trainees in one institution. Hence, resource sharing among several training institutions, particularly through public private partnerships, would be more effective in reducing per student training costs.

Addressing the bottlenecks in the education system that extend the time to graduate from universities will encourage more students, who at present choose not to pursue higher education considering the delay in entering the job market, to enrol in tertiary education programmes. A swift transition from school to employment ensures that fresh entrants to the labour market are young at the inception of employment. Generally, educated youth are more innovative, open for change and more risk-taking, which are essential qualities of a labour force for innovation led growth. Reduction in administrative inefficiencies in releasing examination results and student enrolments, prevention of disruptions to the university system caused by students and staff union action and a possible reduction in the number of years of schooling can significantly reduce the average age of Sri Lankan graduates. In addition, fallback options, such as diploma programmes within the normal undergraduate degree programme, also should be popularised to cater to students who are not willing to spend a long time in education. Tertiary education enrolments can be further increased by offering different trajectories to achieve the same level of education, creating flexibility within the education system to accommodate transitions between work and study as well as between educational programmes, and promoting lifelong learning.

5. Numerous countries use education loans to support tertiary education. For example, university education in Australia has not been free since 1989, but student loan schemes have been in place to financially support students. Currently, the Higher Education Loan Programme (HELP) allows the students to defer their education loan repayments until they are employed. The loan has to be repaid compulsorily over time through the taxation system.

Higher education institutes, both in state and non-state sectors, need to strengthen partnerships with reputable foreign higher education and research institutions, for exchange of student and teaching staff, and collaborative research work. Further, building linkages with domestic and foreign companies is essential to engage in market demanded research activities, and dissemination and commercialisation of research findings. Research grants need to be allocated by the University Grant Commission and research grant committees of the universities considering the impact of research work, which is measured not only in terms of research publications but also based on the commercial value and policy implications of research work.

Higher education institutions also need to offer more interdisciplinary degree programmes with the aim of fostering critical thinking, cognitive and transferable skills of graduates. In this regard, offering STEM courses such as mathematics, statistics and ICT modules in non-STEM degree programmes will enhance the employability of graduates. Currently, the government has made a policy decision to promote STEAM education, where A stands for Arts subjects, at the general and higher education level with the objective of allowing students to learn STEM in a creative manner by integrating with the Arts. This policy also aims to enhance employability of Arts graduates.

Effective coordination among various stakeholders for periodic review of knowledge and skill development strategies, strengthening the quality assurance and accreditation system and applying the same across both state and non-state higher education and TVET

institutions, active involvement of the employers in designing demand driven education and training programmes, and building labour market information system are essential to strengthen the higher education and TVET system.. Encouraging students to work in short-term intensive projects of the private sector under the guidance of industry experts can be an effective method for students to acquire working experience. Meanwhile, employer surveys as well as tracer studies on university and TVET graduates will enable regular assessment of labour market dynamics and ensure relevance of the education and training programmes to labour market needs.

The government envisions achieving robust economic growth through technological revolution across sectors and productivity enhancement of human resources. In order to achieve the government’s ambitious growth targets and enhance the country’s competitiveness within global markets, education policy reforms are key to building a supportive workforce who are well versed in STEM related skills and knowledge, adept at critical and creative thinking, and linguistically competent in global languages.

Housing and Urban Development

The government continued to implement

several projects with the aim of enhancing

housing and urban infrastructure facilities.

Accordingly, the Urban Development Authority

(UDA) carried out the Small Township Development

Programme (Sukitha Purawara) in order to improve

the infrastructure and living standards of city dwellers.

As at end December 2019, 1,439 projects were

completed under this programme. Activities related

to the Urban Regeneration Project continued in

2019 to construct new housing units with the aim of

relocating people who live in shanties, slums and

other dilapidated houses in the city of Colombo

and its immediate suburbs. With an allocation of

Rs. 9.1 billion for the year, 85 per cent physical

progress of the project was achieved by end

2019. Under the Middle Income Housing Project,

500,000 housing units are to be provided to middle

class families to settle within close proximities to

urban centres. Meanwhile, the Metro Colombo

Urban Development Project, which aims to reduce

the physical and socioeconomic impact of floods

and improve local infrastructure and services in

the Metro Colombo Region, continued during

2019, and this project is expected to be completed

by mid-2020. Activities related to the Strategic

Cities Development Projects in Anuradhapura,

Kandy, Jaffna and Galle were continued during

2019. The demand for housing in urban areas

all urban areas, with an emphasis on the city of

Colombo, Colombo Metro region, Kandy, Galle,

Jaffna and other major urban areas. Meanwhile,

approval of the Cabinet of Ministers was granted

for the Gamata Geyak - Ratata Hetak housing

programme in January 2020 which aims to

construct 14,022 houses by providing a house for

one poor family in each Grama Niladhari Division.

The National Housing Development Authority

(NHDA) implemented 1,321 Uda Gammana

projects consisting of 31,171 housing units during

2019. Model village programme under the Uda

Gammana project, has provided housing facilities

for 14,594 families. Moreover, 12,625 new houses

were allotted to resettle families in the Northern

and Eastern Provinces. The Grama Shakthi Uda

Gammana programme and Bogaswewa housing

programme also were in progress under the Uda

Gammana projects. Meanwhile, construction and

renovation of 680 houses were carried out in 2019

under the Viru Sumithuru Housing Programme,

which aims to provide housing facilities to the

families of officers of armed forces who lost their

lives or became disabled. During 2019, the NHDA

continued several other housing programmes,

such as the Reawakened Village programme,

housing for patients affected by kidney disease,

Sampath Sevana programme and Indian funded

housing programme. The NHDA issued 1,160

title deeds and 64 deeds of lease to dwellers

residing in government housing schemes without

property rights. Meanwhile, 30,515 land plots were

allocated for housing construction during 2019.

In addition, the government revised and published

a National Housing Policy with the aim of mitigating

the impact of natural disasters and implementing

the concept of sustainable human settlement

development.

Activities relating to the enhancement of

urban transportation continued during the year

2019. The government took measures to create

an inclusive transportation system in the Western

region in line with the mobility needs within the

area. Accordingly, construction of Kadawatha Multi

Modal Centre and Polduwa bypass road–Stage III

projects were in progress during 2019. Meanwhile,

preliminary work related to the elevated railway

track from Malabe to Fort under the Light Rail

Transit project continued in 2019. Physical

construction work of the project is expected to

commence in May 2021 with the assistance of the

Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).

Recent disruptions to waste disposal in the

Metro Colombo Region highlight the need for

sound actions on urban waste management.

The Metro Colombo Solid Waste Management

Project has been initiated to provide a long term

sustainable solid waste management system for

urban areas by constructing a sanitary landfill in

Aruwakkalu in the Puttalam District along with a

waste loading station in Kelaniya to transport

waste to the landfill site. The sanitary landfill is

designed to dispose of 1,200 MT of waste per

day. Although the landfill is still under construction

and can handle only 600 MT of waste per day,

the Aruwakkalu landfill accepted waste from

08 August 2019 since the waste disposals had

exceeded the capacity at the Kerawalapitiya

waste disposal site. However, garbage disposal

can be harmful without the construction of the

full site being completed, particularly without the

leachate treatment plant. Therefore, acceptance of

garbage by the Aruwakkalu site was suspended

from 18 December 2019 until the site is developed

to an acceptable level, including the leachate

treatment plant. Meanwhile, construction activities

of the transfer stations, and other infrastructure

developments were also in progress during 2019.

Moreover, the government implemented various

projects including the rehabilitation of the existing

dumpsite in Meethotamulla, the composting plant

in Kerawalapitiya and waste to energy projects

in Kerawalapitiya and Karadiyana, to handle

increasing quantities of solid waste in the urban

environment. Accordingly, the first waste to energy

project in Sri Lanka is expected to commence its

operations in the first half of 2020.

The Colombo Port City Development project

continued its activities during 2019 with the aim

to build a new world class city inclusive of all

modern amenities. Land reclamation activities were

completed by January 2019 and the Port City land

was declared a part of the Colombo District and an

urban development area under the purview of Urban

Development Authority. Infrastructure development

activities commenced in 2019, but a significant

progress was not achieved in terms of attracting

foreign investments for the project during the period

under review. Therefore, the government plans to

embark on a vigorous promotional campaign to

fast track investment. Accordingly, the Port City is

planned to be launched to attract investments at the

World Cities Summit, which is to be held in Singapore

in July 2020.

Poverty Alleviation and Safety Nets

The poverty level, as reflected by the Poverty

Headcount Ratio (PHCR), has continued to

decline throughout the last few decades,

consistent with socio-economic developments

in Sri Lanka. According to the Household Income

and Expenditure Survey (HIES) of the Department

of Census and Statistics (DCS) in 2016, the overall

PHCR was 4.1 per cent although poverty pockets

still persisted across the country. The highest PHCR

recorded at the provincial level was for the Northern

Province (7.7 per cent), while Kilinochchi registered

the highest PHCR of 18.2 per cent at the district level.

The major provincial contribution to the total poverty

was from the Central, Sabaragamuwa, Eastern and

Western provinces that collectively accounted for

58.6 per cent of the total poor population, representing

494,596 poor persons. The Gini coefficient, which

measures the household income inequality,

displayed a marginal improvement to 0.45 in 2016

from 0.48 in HIES 2012/13. However, a high level of

vulnerability exists with the nonpoor population who

live just above the poverty line. An increase in the

national poverty line by 10 per cent (from Rs. 4,166

to Rs. 4,582.60) would increase the PHCR up to

6.1 per cent. Accordingly, over 400,000 people fall

within 10 per cent above the poverty line. These

people are highly vulnerable to become destitute due

to shocks such as sickness of a family member or a

natural disaster.

According to the Demography and

Health Survey (DHS) - 2016 of the DCS, the

Multidimensional Poverty Head Count Ratio

(MPHCR) was 2.4 per cent in Sri Lanka.

Multidimensional poverty measures poverty using

10 indicators under three dimensions, namely

education, health and living standard, which are

equally weighted. The indicators include years

of schooling, school attendance, nutrition, child

mortality, electricity, drinking water, sanitation, floor

of the house, cooking fuel and house owned assets.

The MPHCR is significantly low in Sri Lanka, but

11.9 per cent of the population, i.e. 2.5 million

persons, are vulnerable to multidimensional poverty,

while 0.2 per cent of the population is severely

multidimensionally poor in 2016.

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

137

Various social assistance, safety nets and

poverty alleviation programmes were continued

by the government in 2019. The social assistance

programmes conducted through the Department

of Samurdhi Development (DSD) are distinctive

elements of Sri Lanka’s social protection system.

Under the Budget 2019, it was approved to provide

Samurdhi benefits to another 600,000 families but

only 433,594 families were newly granted benefits in

August 2019. With the addition of these new families,

approximately 33 per cent of Sri Lankan households

are receiving the Samurdhi benefits although

overall poverty levels are relatively low. Further,

the government continued to provide vital food and

nutritional assistance to expecting and lactating

mothers and children. In 2019, Rs. 5,279 million

was incurred to provide nutritional food packages for

expectant mothers and Rs 327.2 million to provide

morning meals for 83,515 preschool children.

Further, Rs. 79.9 million was spent on tuition fee

support for 22,303 poor early childhood students.

Meanwhile, under the Samurdhi Social Security

Benefit Scheme, Rs. 1.2 billion was disbursed

among 317,722 beneficiaries. In addition, Samurdhi

Banking Societies disbursed micro finance loans

worth Rs. 53.4 billion among 693,551 beneficiaries

with the aim of enhancing access to credit for low

income families. A new instant loan scheme named

Dhanasaviya was implemented for compulsory

savings holders, whereas the Dhanabhimani

self-employment loan scheme was introduced

to empower Samurdhi recipients. With the view

of empowering poor families, 6,011 projects

in the areas of animal husbandry, fisheries,

self-employment, industrial development and

model village development were completed with an

expenditure of Rs. 504.9 million in 2019. According

to the HIES-2016, the government pension scheme

has been the most effective social assistance

programme in reducing poverty, as the elimination

of pension would result in the PHCR increasing to

5.7 per cent, whereas the elimination of Samurdhi

would result in PHCR increasing only up to

4.3 per cent. Although the Samurdhi/ Divineguma/

Janasaviya programmes have played a major role

in reducing poverty in the past few decades, better

targeting is needed to address remaining chronic

poverty effectively. In order to reduce the persistent

reliance of households on social assistance transfers

and ease the burden on government budget, it is

important to reassess current Samurdhi recipients

and provide Samurdhi benefits only to those who

are actually poor and vulnerable to poverty. Further,

Samurdhi recipients should be encouraged to build

up their own livelihoods and gradually move out of

the social assistance programmes. To this end, a

strong investment stimulus is required to connect the

rural and estate sectors to the booming urban sector

while generating growth dynamics in rural and estate

sectors with micro level intervention focusing on

poor households. In addition, differentiated effective

poverty alleviation programmes should be designed

and implemented to raise income and employment

opportunities among poor persons, while enabling

them to withstand emergencies, such as natural

disasters or sudden displacements. Institutional

reforms are required to address inherent structural

weaknesses in the public institutional apparatus

related to social assistance that make coordination,

planning, programming and implementation

challenging.

Environment

In recent years, Sri Lanka has been adversely

affected by natural disasters frequently, including

those driven by climate change, highlighting

the importance of policy reforms on disaster

preparedness, emergency operations and post

disaster activities pertaining to such incidents.

According to the Global Climate Risk Index - 2020,

Sri Lanka was ranked 6th most affected country by

weather-related hazards such as floods, heat

waves, storms and landslides occurred in 2018.

Moreover, as per the Disaster Management Centre,

935,098 people were affected by drought conditions

that prevailed mostly during the early parts of 2019.

Jaffna and Ampara were the most affected districts

due to droughts in 2019. Colombo, Badulla and

Ampara were reported as severely affected districts

from flooding. Meanwhile 579,428 people were

affected, and 13 people died due to floods in 2019.

These developments highlight the vulnerability of

Sri Lanka to climate related disasters and the need

for an effective integrated mechanism based on a

holistic policy and well-defined strategies. A major

shift in policies is needed to improve resilience

to disasters and climate change, and minimise

disaster related social costs.

The government adopted several policy

measures to protect the environment and

mitigate disasters with the aim of maintaining a

balance between the environment and economic

growth. Accordingly, the Disaster Management

Centre continued its efforts on emergency

operation management, particularly during the

droughts and floods in 2019, dissemination of early

warnings and preservation of the environment

from natural disasters. Landslide hazard mapping

and risk assessment programmes continued

during 2019 under the National Building Research

Organisation (NBRO). Construction activities to

stabilise unstable slopes surrounding 18 schools in

the Kandy District and 21 unstable slopes along the

Central Expressway were completed by December

2019, under the Climate Resilience Improvement

Project (CRIP) with financial assistance from the

World Bank. The Department of Meteorology (DoM)

issued 6,928 forecasts and 759 warnings and

advisories to the general public, related authorities

and the Department of Fisheries to ensure

preparedness for weather related disturbances.

The implementation process of Phase-(I) of the

Climate Resilience Multi-Phased Programmatic

Approach (CResMPA) to upgrade the forecasting

capabilities of the DoM commenced in September

2019. Moreover, during the year under review,

Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) techniques

were also carried out to issue more localised

forecast and warnings. The National Disaster

Relief Service Centre (NDRSC) progressed in its

post disaster response activities to support people

who face inconveniences during disasters. Initial

steps were taken to implement a Disaster Relief

Services Preparedness and Response Plan with

technical support from the World Food Programme.

Accordingly, the plan is prepared for 185 Divisional

Secretariats in all districts and awareness

programmes were conducted during 2019.

The Central Environmental Authority (CEA)

engaged in various activities to protect and

manage the environment by adopting new

environmental laws and regulations. The CEA

3

issues Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and

Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) certificates,

after evaluating the possible environmental impact

of proposed projects. Accordingly, the CEA issued

17 EIA approvals and 266 IEE approvals in 2019.

In order to regulate the environmental pollution, the

CEA granted Environmental Protection Licenses

(EPL) to the companies of potentially polluting

industries. With the support of the NBRO and the

Department of Motor Traffic, real time automated

monitoring stations in Battaramulla and Kandy were

operated from January 2019 under the National

Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme to assess

air pollutant levels. In November 2019, air pollution

level in the Colombo City increased notably, which

was more likely due to transboundary air pollution

emanating from India, and the NBRO warned the

public to remain vigilant. However, this significant

increase in pollution level was fairly short-lived. The

CEA carried out water quality monitoring activities in

major water bodies, while taking steps to amend the

National Environmental Act with special consideration

to ground water protection. Moreover, the CEA was

involved in solid and hazardous waste management

projects in 2019. Meanwhile, initial steps were taken

by the CEA to implement a project called Lak Pivithuru

to address the solid waste problem, subsequent to the

end of the Pilisaru solid waste management project

in May 2019. Moreover, the CEA was also engaged

in environmental protection activities, including the

enforcement of polythene regulations, establishment

of environmental compliance monitoring networks and

amendments to environmental laws and regulations.

The Forest Department continued its

activities to conserve and develop national

forest resources in the country. In 2019,

a programme on Enhancing Biodiversity

Conservation and Sustenance of Ecosystem

Services in Environmentally Sensitive Areas

was completed in the Anuradhapura District.

In addition, the Ecosystem Conservation and

Management Project (ESCAMP) continued in 2019

with financial assistance from the World Bank with

a focus on improving the management of sensitive

ecosystems in selected locations for conservation

and community benefits. Sri Lanka is recognised as

a biodiversity hotspot in the world, but deforestation

has threatened the country’s biodiversity in recent

years. The extent of land deforested during 2019

decreased to 849 hectares while the extent

reforested in 2019 was 890 hectares. There were

120 detected cases of smuggling of indigenous

herbs in 2019. The latest survey on forest cover

estimation was carried out in 2015 and the survey

data will be made available in 2020. Meanwhile,

in 2020, the next round of this survey is expected

to commence. Sri Lanka also needs to embrace

geospatial technological advancements in the

world, such as the geographic information system

(GIS), global positioning system (GPS) and remote

sensing technologies, to collect and manage

forest cover data, and digitally demarcate forest

boundaries for easy identification of changes of

forest cover within and outside the recorded forest

area.
