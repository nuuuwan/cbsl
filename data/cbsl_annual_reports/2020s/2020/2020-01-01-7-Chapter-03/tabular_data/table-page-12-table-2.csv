"cost of coal and NCRE sources in Sri Lanka to be USD 
Term Generation Expansion Plan of the CEB, the SLSEA 
aims to increase the share of renewable energy, apart 
from major hydropower, in power generation from the 
current  level  of  10.7  per  cent  to  15  per  cent  by  end-
2030.  The  government  launched  a  community  based 
solar  power  generation  project  in  2016,  Soorya  Bala 
and 
(LECO).  This  programme  expects  to  add  200  MW  of 
solar electricity to the national grid by 2020 and 1,000 
MW  by  2025.  Meanwhile,  the  construction  of  several 
wind  power  plants 
progress.  Although  waste  management  has  become  a 
serious  issue  in  the  country,  only  one  waste-to-energy 
project has been commissioned up to now. Growth in 
non-conventional  renewable  energy  generation  is  still 
slow  paced  in  Sri  Lanka,  hence  the  government  and 
Limitations  of  NCRE  as  Sustainable  Energy 
Sources
As any other energy source, NCRE has its limitations in 
terms of sustainability. The primary barrier for the usage 
of  NCRE  such  as  solar  and  wind,  is  the  high  capital 
related to installation of the power plants. Although these 
sources typically require large upfront capital investments, 
financial returns over the long term are uncertain, and 
partly  dependent  on  national  policies  on  issues  such 
as feed-in tariffs. Hence, financial institutions are more 
likely to perceive renewable projects as risky, charging 
high  interest  rates  on  project  borrowings.  Generally, 
NCRE sources offer a decentralised generation model, 
in which, smaller generating stations are spread across 
a  large  area.  Hence,  cost  of  transmission  is  relatively 
high in such models where financing can be a significant 
barrier for both developers and end users. The average 
cost of generation is still perceived to be high for most 
NCREs in comparison to that of coal. However, many 
countries have been able to drastically reduce the cost 
of  NCRE  in  recent  years,  through  competitive  bidding 
for 
energy 
subsidies for NCRE producers, especially for household 
level  production,  and  duty  waivers  for  the  importation 
of  solar  PV  panels.  For  instance,  India  has  been  able 
to reduce the cost of wind power to be on par or lower 
than the cost of energy generation from imported coal 
(Shrimali  et.  al.,  2015).  Moreover,  the  cost  of  setting 
up solar power plants in India has declined by 80 per 
cent between 2010 to 2018 and the country recorded 
the world’s lowest installation cost of new solar power 
plants in 2018 (International Renewable Energy Agency, 
2019b). Meanwhile, CEB’s estimates of the cost of coal 
power generation does not include the cost of financing 
the coal power plant, whereas the estimate of the cost 
of  NCRE  comprises  repayment  of  project  costs  to  the 
NCRE  producers  by  the  CEB.  Hence,  the  CEB’s  costs 
cannot be directly used to compare the costs of different 
energy 
sources.  Accordingly,
