of STEM literacy in the country is not adequate to achieve 
an  innovation  led  growth.  The  graduate  output  of  the 
public university system in Sri Lanka is more biased towards 
Arts and Humanities subjects and less towards STEM fields. 
In 2018, the percentage of university students enrolled in 
STEM fields for undergraduate studies was 14.8 per cent. 
As indicated in Table B 9.1, the share of student enrolment 
in STEM fields in Sri Lanka is lower than in industrialised 
countries and other middle income countries.
