fairly easily experience a slowdown in economic growth 
once they reach the middle income stage. On the one

hand, these countries are unable to compete with low 
wage,  poor  economies  who  have 
labour 
intensive, 
imitation driven merchandise export sectors. Conversely,

they also fail to compete with advanced economies that

export innovation driven manufactured goods produced 
using highly productive skilled labour. As a result, these 
China
middle income countries do not make a timely transition 
from resource led growth to productivity driven growth, 
and  this  phenomenon  is  termed  the  ‘middle  income 
trap’.  Escaping  the  middle  income  trap  is  challenging 
for  Sri  Lanka  as  well,  but  is  crucial  for  the  country  to 
achieve a sustainable, high growth path.     
As  per 
the  World  Bank 
classification, 
Sri 
Lanka 
surpassed the lower middle income threshold in 1997, 
but  21  years  lapsed  until  the  country  was  elevated  to 
the  upper  middle  income  status.  If  the  country  grows 
hindering 
at  a  5  per  cent  annual  growth  rate,1  Sri  Lanka  may 
require  another  22-23  years  to  transcend  to  a  high 
income nation. Therefore, Sri Lanka could be caught in 
a ‘middle income trap’ for over 40 years, unless growth 
focused  structural  reforms  and  strategies  are  urgently 
implemented  alongside  policies 
for  macroeconomic 
growth. 
Although  there  are  numerous  factors  that  are  vital  to 
ensure  high  economic  growth  at  the  middle  income 
stage, a sound education system is always of paramount 
importance  to  accumulate  human  capital  and  thereby 
raise  a  country’s  competitiveness.  A  good  education 
system  equips  the  labour  force  with  marketable  skills 
while 
spurring 
innovations  and  productivity  growth. 
Often,  public 
investment 
in  a  country 
is  aimed  at 
improving the general level of education. For example, 
Sri  Lanka  adopted  an  education  policy  to  offer  free 
education  at  primary,  secondary  and  tertiary  levels  in 
1945,  and  today  the  country  enjoys  an  impressively 
high literacy rate among both males (93.4 per cent in 
2018) and females (91.6 per cent in 2018). Although 
increasing  literacy  levels  are  important  for  the  country 
to move ahead of the regional peers in terms of human 
development; as Figure B 9.1 depicts, the country still 
lags behind in terms of innovation and competitiveness, 
factors  which  are  core  to  accelerate  economic  growth 
during the middle income stage.
