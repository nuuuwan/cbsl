well as the environment.  Though the basic need for energy 
cannot be changed, policymakers have identified the need 
to opt for more sustainable energy sources, due to adverse 
effects caused by fossil fuel based energy sources. Hence, 
management  and  development  of  energy  sources  are 
identified by the United Nations as core requirements for 
achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Under 
the SDG-7, all countries are committed to provide ‘access 
to  affordable,  reliable,  sustainable  and  modern  energy 
for all’. In a broader sense, sustainable energy underpins 
almost  all  SDGs,  particularly  related  to  industrialisation, 
economic  growth,  sustainable  cities,  poverty  reduction, 
health,  education  as  well  as  climate  change.  The  Paris 
Agreement - 2015, of which Sri Lanka is also a signatory, 
has recognised that carbon-intensive economic growth is 
no longer a route for sustainable development. Therefore, 
clean and sustainable energy sources should be the centre 
of Sri Lanka’s sustainable development agenda. 
Sustainable  energy  is  a  multidimensional  concept  that 
advocates the provision of adequate and reliable energy 
to  both  current  and 
future  generations,  at  affordable 
prices in an environmentally friendly manner. Sustainable 
energy  usage  includes  three  facets:  first,  environmental 
sustainability 
that 
aims 
to 
emissions  and  harmful  and  toxic  waste,  and  minimise 
adverse effects on biodiversity; second, social sustainability 
that  encompasses  poverty  eradication,  improving  living 
standards and wellbeing of the people as well as energy 
security;  third,  economic  sustainability  that  ensures  low 
cost  and  affordability  of  energy  sources,  reliability  of  the 
energy  supply  and  employment  creation  in  relation  to 
energy generation. Although renewable energy is generally 
referred to as sustainable energy sources, not all renewable 
energy projects are necessarily sustainable. For instance, 
biomass  is  renewable  energy,  but  clearing  of  forests  for 
biomass production and cultivation of plants for biomass 
production in a water scarce area are not environmentally 
sustainable  practices.  Therefore,  renewable  energy  also 
needs  to  be  used  in  a  sustainable  manner.  All  energy 
sources  have  their  own  advantages  and  disadvantages 
in relation to environmental, social and economic fronts.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Economic development of a country has a strong positive 
correlation  with  energy  usage,  and  most  often  with 
high  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  However, 
energy  sources  can  play  an  important  role  in  reducing
