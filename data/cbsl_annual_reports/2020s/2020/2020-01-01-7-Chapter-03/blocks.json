    "text": "Energy is imperative for economic growth as it is a fundamental input for all economic activities including industrial production, transportation and household consumption. Though the gains from economic growth through increased energy consumption have been impressive across the globe, such high energy usage has far-reaching implications on environmental systems and the society mainly due to unsustainable practices. These unsustainable energy usage practices not only result in a rapid depletion of energy sources, but also cause climate change that can have detrimental effects on living beings as well as the environment. Though the basic need for energy cannot be changed, policymakers have identified the need to opt for more sustainable energy sources, due to adverse effects caused by fossil fuel based energy sources. Hence, management and development of energy sources are identified by the United Nations as core requirements for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Under the SDG-7, all countries are committed to provide \u2018access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all\u2019. In a broader sense, sustainable energy underpins almost all SDGs, particularly related to industrialisation, economic growth, sustainable cities, poverty reduction, health, education as well as climate change. The Paris Agreement - 2015, of which Sri Lanka is also a signatory, has recognised that carbon-intensive economic growth is no longer a route for sustainable development. Therefore, clean and sustainable energy sources should be the centre of Sri Lanka\u2019s sustainable development agenda.",

Sustainable energy usage includes three facets: first, environmental sustainability that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and harmful and toxic waste, and minimise adverse effects on biodiversity; second, social sustainability that encompasses poverty eradication, improving living standards and wellbeing of the people as well as energy security; third, economic sustainability that ensures low cost and affordability of energy sources, reliability of the energy supply and employment creation in relation to energy generation. Although renewable energy is generally referred to as sustainable energy sources, not all renewable energy projects are necessarily sustainable. For instance, biomass is renewable energy, but clearing of forests for biomass production and cultivation of plants for biomass production in a water scarce area are not environmentally sustainable practices. Therefore, renewable energy also needs to be used in a sustainable manner. All energy sources have their own advantages and disadvantages in relation to environmental, social and economic fronts.",

Generally, prices of non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuel are highly volatile due to demand and supply conditions, and are more prone to geopolitical tensions.

Generally, NCRE sources offer a decentralised generation model, in which, smaller generating stations are spread across a large area. Hence, cost of transmission is relatively high in such models where financing can be a significant barrier for both developers and end users. The average cost of generation is still perceived to be high for most NCREs in comparison to that of coal. However, many countries have been able to drastically reduce the cost of NCRE in recent years, through competitive bidding for energy procurement, government grants and subsidies for NCRE producers, especially for household level production, and duty waivers for the importation of solar PV panels. For instance, India has been able to reduce the cost of wind power to be on par or lower than the cost of energy generation from imported coal (Shrimali et. al., 2015). Moreover, the cost of setting up solar power plants in India has declined by 80 per cent between 2010 to 2018 and the country recorded the world\u2019s lowest installation cost of new solar power plants in 2018 (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2019b). Meanwhile, CEB\u2019s estimates of the cost of coal power generation does not include the cost of financing the coal power plant, whereas the estimate of the cost of NCRE comprises repayment of project costs to the NCRE producers by the CEB. Hence, the CEB\u2019s costs cannot be directly used to compare the costs of different energy sources. Accordingly, the World Bank and International Finance Corporation have estimated the",

    "text": "Though renewable energy resources are available around the world, many of these resources are intermittent energy sources and are not available year-round. Solar, wind, wave and tidal energy sources are intermittently available depending on the weather and the time of day. Most electricity grids are constructed to comply with nonintermittent energy sources such as fuel oil based or coal fired power plants. However, overall intermittency of the renewable energy sources can be reduced by using a combination of these sources. With more and more NCRE sources integrated into the system, grid modifications become necessary to ensure the supply of electricity is matched to daily variation in demand. Further, geographic limitations such as climate, topographies and vegetation also affect the installation of renewable energy plants. The extra challenge against solar power is recycling or disposing of solar panels without causing health and environmental hazards since they contain base metals such as lead, chromium, and cadmium. This can be a fairly costly process.",

    "text": "Sustainable energy usage is crucial for both economic and human development. Since the electricity and transportation sectors are energy-intensive activities, sustainable energy usage should be promoted in these sectors. In this regard, Sri Lanka needs to formulate an appropriate sustainable energy mix for electricity generation in consideration of long run economic costs as well as externalities of energy sources on the environment and society. Competitive bidding by electricity producers that use various energy sources should be encouraged to reduce overall cost of energy generation. As Sri Lanka is highly dependent on fossil fuels, the country faces a wide spectrum of challenges in the transition towards sustainable energy such as cost reflective energy pricing, grid modifications and energy conservation. Non-renewable energy sources are likely to be financially attractive than NCRE sources since financial costs of fuel oil and coal do not encompass the cost of environmental effects of those sources. Prior to the sharp decline in oil prices due the COVID-19 pandemic, most petroleum products in Sri Lanka were at subsidised prices without reflecting their true economic costs. Therefore, financial incentives are needed to make NCRE sources more financially attractive than non-renewable sources. Attractive feed-in tariffs, net metering systems, investment tax credits, subsidised interest rates for project loans, green bonds and soft loans are possible financial interventions to promote NCRE projects in the country.",

When the share of NCRE in total electricity generation increases, Sri Lanka will need grid energy storage methods, such as pumped-storage hydroelectricity and batteries, to store and release excess energy when required. However, pumped-storage hydroelectricity is feasible only at locations near hills, and battery technologies are still expensive. Nevertheless, complementary energy sources such as hydroelectricity or natural gas can be used to produce backup power. In addition, reducing demand for electricity at certain times of the day through smart grid usage and energy demand management can also ease intermittency issues.",

For instance, improving the efficiency, reliability and comfort of public transport systems, increasing fuel efficient vehicle fleet, minimising travel by better urban designs, improving on-road fuel efficiency through better traffic management, promotion of low carbon fuels and encouraging people to shift to nonmotorised modes, including biking and walking, are some measures that can promote sustainable energy usage in the transport sector.",

On the one hand, these countries are unable to compete with low wage, poor economies who have labour intensive, imitation driven merchandise export sectors. Conversely, they also fail to compete with advanced economies that export innovation driven manufactured goods produced using highly productive skilled labour. As a result, these middle income countries do not make a timely transition from resource led growth to productivity driven growth, and this phenomenon is termed the \u2018middle income trap\u2019. Escaping the middle income trap is challenging for Sri Lanka as well, but is crucial for the country to achieve a sustainable, high growth path.",

A good education system equips the labour force with marketable skills while spurring innovations and productivity growth. Often, public investment in a country is aimed at improving the general level of education. For example, Sri Lanka adopted an education policy to offer free education at primary, secondary and tertiary levels in 1945, and today the country enjoys an impressively high literacy rate among both males (93.4 per cent in 2018) and females (91.6 per cent in 2018). Although increasing literacy levels are important for the country to move ahead of the regional peers in terms of human development; as Figure B 9.1 depicts, the country still lags behind in terms of innovation and competitiveness, factors which are core to accelerate economic growth during the middle income stage.",

    "text": "With economic development, skills requirements in an economy also evolve over time. Therefore, education policies and investments need to be dynamically adjusted to align with the evolving skills requirements of the economy, in order to achieve simultaneous progress in human and economic development. If the education system is not aligned with the economic growth needs, the country will face persistent skills gaps and mismatches hindering further economic growth. Persistent skills gaps and mismatches can hamper economic growth in three ways: first, firms will not be able to expand their operations and compete in global markets without the required skilled labour; second, firms will be restricted to lower rungs of global value chains as they fail to upgrade their technologies; third, lack of skilled labour will discourage foreign direct investment inflows. Countries such as Singapore and South Korea, which successfully evaded the middle income trap, have implemented major education sector reforms from time to time and phased in public education investments to align their education system with the needs of the evolving economy. For example, from 1965 to 1978, Singapore\u2019s education policies were striving to provide universal access to primary and secondary education and enhance technical skills that are essential for labour intensive production. But with the intensifying competition for labour intensive exports from their regional peers, during the 1980s, Singapore focused on equipping the labour force with skills that are needed for capital intensive production. Since the 1990s, Singapore has gradually transformed into a knowledge based economy. In parallel, the country\u2019s education policies refocused on strengthening tertiary education by establishing new universities, building partnerships with foreign universities and improving labour productivity through innovation. However, replication of the education system reforms of these successful countries within the Sri Lankan economy may not be feasible without suitable adjustments, since many socio-economic factors in Sri Lanka, such as the level of human development, structure",

To this end, the country should have a highly skilled labour force, particularly a bank of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) literate employees. Although overall literacy rates that capture only the reading and writing ability are high in Sri Lanka, the level of STEM literacy in the country is not adequate to achieve an innovation led growth. The graduate output of the public university system in Sri Lanka is more biased towards Arts and Humanities subjects and less towards STEM fields. In 2018, the percentage of university students enrolled in STEM fields for undergraduate studies was 14.8 per cent. As indicated in Table B 9.1, the share of student enrolment in STEM fields in Sri Lanka is lower than in industrialised countries and other middle income countries.",

According to the Tracer Study of Graduates conducted by the University Grant Commission in 2016/2017, unemployment rates among graduates of state universities in the fields of Performing Arts, Arts and Management are 57.1 per cent, 50.4 per cent and 27.7 per cent, respectively, even after 2-3 years of graduation, indicating a mismatch of skills with the labour market demand. On the other hand, graduates from STEM fields such as Allied Health Science, Engineering, Science and Agriculture have reported higher employment rates of 95.7 per cent, 92.2 per cent, 83.0 per cent and 82.6 per cent, respectively. While there is an excess supply of non-STEM graduates from universities, skill gaps are persistent in certain fields in the job market. For example, according to the ICT/BPM workforce survey -2019 conducted by the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA), the demand for IT graduates have increased from 6,246 in 2014 to 21,216 by 2019, although the supply of total IT graduates has increased only to 12,307 in 2018, indicating a widening skill gap in the IT field.",

Since there is no central planning mechanism for the TVET sector, the designing of training programmes, student enrolment, and quality standards and accreditations are not aligned with the country\u2019s growth policies and labour market needs. Although the National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) system has been introduced with the aim of defining training standards on the basis of occupational requirements, the quality assurance process in the TVET system is still not fully effective since many private TVET institutions are neither accredited nor registered.

In addition, employers\u2019 involvement in designing the courses and delivering training programmes is minimal in most TVET courses, resulting in low relevance of TVET training for employment. Meanwhile, the student demand for TVET is at a subdued level as a result of the social stigma associated with technical jobs as well as lack of knowledge on the employment opportunities for the people with vocational training. Recently there have been attempts to route the youth who fail at the G.C.E O/L examination hurdle to receive NVQ level education through the \u201813 Years of Guaranteed Education\u2019 policy. However, this programme is still at an incipient stage with shortages of qualified staff particularly in rural areas, where the TVET system is most needed.",

Although past education policies of successive governments have focused on providing universal education opportunities to students, Sri Lanka now must refocus the country\u2019s education policies to align with the economic development goals to become globally competitive and thereby escape the middle income trap. In this regard, emphasis of the education system should be on STEM fields as well as improving English literacy, which are crucial in building linkages with the global markets. Hence, Sri Lanka needs integrated policy reforms at all levels of education in order to build a STEM literate workforce.",

Meanwhile, the range of education streams at the A/L stage should be widened in all schools while allocating resources and trained staff equitably across schools for STEM subjects and English. Equitable access to STEM and English education is vital to achieve inclusive economic growth. Resource allocation to national schools and provincial schools are primarily made through the Central Government and Provincial Councils, respectively, which inevitably results in large disparities in physical resource allocation and teacher deployment across schools. Hence, resource and teacher cadre requirements and shortages at school level should be monitored through a central database system. Further, the allocation of resources and teacher deployment should be made on a needs basis through a central mechanism. An incentive scheme needs to be introduced for teachers in STEM fields to work in underprivileged schools. Building partnerships with the private sector to enhance digital technology resources in underprivileged schools will not only reduce the digital",

Since the state sector alone cannot meet the skill demand in the economy, private sector engagement in tertiary education, supported by strong quality assurance and accreditation mechanisms, is vital to raise higher education and TVET enrolment rates. Further, concessionary education loans5 should be promoted to encourage students who are unable to enrol in state universities to pursue higher education opportunities through non-state higher education institutions. The education/ training cost per student in STEM fields is generally high, since resources such as laboratories and equipment are costly though the resources may not be fully utilised due to the limited number of students/ trainees in one institution. Hence, resource sharing among several training institutions, particularly through public private partnerships, would be more effective in reducing per student training costs.",

    "text": "Addressing the bottlenecks in the education system that extend the time to graduate from universities will encourage more students, who at present choose not to pursue higher education considering the delay in entering the job market, to enrol in tertiary education programmes. A swift transition from school to employment ensures that fresh entrants to the labour market are young at the inception of employment. Generally, educated youth are more innovative, open for change and more risk-taking, which are essential qualities of a labour force for innovation led growth. Reduction in administrative inefficiencies in releasing examination results and student enrolments, prevention of disruptions to the university system caused by students and staff union action and a possible reduction in the number of years of schooling can significantly reduce the average age of Sri Lankan graduates. In addition, fallback options, such as diploma programmes within the normal undergraduate degree programme, also should be popularised to cater to students who are not willing to spend a long time in education. Tertiary education enrolments can be further increased by offering different trajectories to achieve the same level of education, creating flexibility within the education system to accommodate transitions between work and study as well as between educational programmes, and promoting lifelong learning.",
