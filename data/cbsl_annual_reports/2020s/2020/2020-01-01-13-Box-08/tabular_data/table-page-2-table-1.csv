results).  Available  at:  https://www.","","the  Banque  de  France  (Central  Bank  of  France)  and

regulatory 
institutions  around 
the  world  have 
started  various  projects  in  the  area  of  Big  Data  and 
digitalisation, as the use of Big Data collected through 
web  scraping  and  text  mining  is  often  advantageous 
over the conventional survey data because of the high 
velocity and high volume. 
The contribution of digitalisation to the data processing 
stage is the most sophisticated and complicated element 
of  the  entire  process  of  smart  statistics.  One  of  the 
differences  between  the  traditional  job  of  statisticians 
and  the  digital  process  is  that  both  data  collection 
and  processing  run  on  software  using  programming 
languages thereby leading to limited manual intervention 
in 
the  digital  process. 
In  an  advanced  setting, 
the 
human element would be further reduced with the use 
of  ‘Machine  Learning’  and  ‘Artificial  Intelligence’  that 
will capture algorithms in data and carryout analytical 
tasks autonomously.  
Data visualisation is the final stage of the statistical process, 
which  converts  the  statistical  estimates  to  graphical  and 
other  means  of  presentation.  Official  statistics,  which 
are  traditionally  presented  through  tables,  reports  and 
graphs  will  be  generated  using  tools  such  as  visualising 
dashboards, which graphically and illustratively present the 
key statistical estimates. These dashboards are interactive 
and  could  be  tailored  to  the  needs  of  individual  users. 
Central  banks 
in 
their 
transformation 
towards  being 
digital are exploring the potential of using these visualising 
dashboards for managerial decision-making in the policy-
setting process."

An interesting 
area of research
What digitalisation has in offer for statisticians   
Digitalisation contributes to the field of statistics at each 
stage  of  its  traditional  process,  from  data  collection 
to  the  final  outcome.  The  traditional  data  collection 
methods would be replaced/supported by data digitally 
collected  using  methods  such  as  Web  Scraping  and 
Text  Mining.  Web  Scraping,  in  simple  terms,  refers  to 
the  process  of  extracting  specific  data  available  on 
relevant  web  sites  by  using  programming  software. 
Central banks around the world have started projects on 
scraping price and other data recorded on various web 
sites  to  support  their  monetary  policy-setting  process, 
which  include  forecasting  inflation  using  price  data, 
labour force dynamics of the economy through various 
job  market  web  sites,  and  identifying  the  unorganised 
sector contribution to the national output through web 
sites related to Barter/Sharing economy.
