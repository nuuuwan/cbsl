Rapid developments in information technology, however, challenged the traditional role of statisticians as certain statistical functions are becoming increasingly complex.",

Traditional methods such as survey through questionnaires, one-to-one or phone interviews and secondary data from published sources are still being used as official sources for statistics produced by any organisation due to their reliability and customisability. However, over time, these traditional data collection methods experienced constraints not because of intrinsic features of such methods, but due to the widening horizons of digitalisation coupled with high frequency data generated through various means and platforms. These high frequency data get accumulated in various formats around cyber space, but, until recently, alternative uses of such data have not been adequately explored.",

Despite that these concepts originated in early 2000\u2019s, most of the terminology used in relation to Big Data lack universally accepted definitions1. Nevertheless, its usage seems to have encompassed over a wider spectrum as different online platforms on the World Wide Web generate a large part of Big Data while cashier terminals of supermarkets, automated vending machines, surveillance camera units, etc., also gather massive volumes of data on a daily basis. This data is originally recorded for a particular purpose and Big Data becomes a by-product of that process. Because of its recording frequency, such data becomes an incredible source, which outperforms most of the traditional data sources used in the statistical process in terms of volume and speed.",

In the present context, statistics generated using these unconventional data is called \u2018Smart Statistics\u2019 and are used as an alternative stream to complement official statistics.

In this regard, CBSL took initiatives to adopt web scraping to collect prices of imported food and beverage items posted online on a daily basis.

Accordingly, CBSL is developing an Asking Price Index for lands in Colombo District and intends to expand it to the entire country. Moreover, a House Price Index for residential housing properties covering the entire country and a Condominium Price Index covering properties in the Colombo District are being compiled using scraped data.
