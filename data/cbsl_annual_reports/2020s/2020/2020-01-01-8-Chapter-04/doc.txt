4.1 OverviewD

uring 2019, the general price level,

as measured by official price indices,

moved in tandem with the prices of

Volatile Food items, which declined during the

first three months of the year and increased

thereafter recording considerably higher prices

towards the latter part of the year. Price pressures

stemming from supply shortages in certain food

items during the year were partially mitigated by

timely reduction of some administered prices and

duties on imported food items. The significant

increase in food prices witnessed towards the

latter part of the year was mainly due to supply

shortages caused by adverse weather conditions

that prevailed especially in major cultivating

areas. However, the reduction of the VAT rate

and telecommunication levy, and removal of NBT

in December 2019 made a favourable impact

on the general price level. Reflecting these

movements, headline inflation, as measured in

terms of the year-on-year change in National

Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100), mostly

remained in low single digit levels, while the year-

on-year change in Colombo Consumer Price

Index (CCPI, 2013=100), mostly remained within

the range of 4.0-6.0 per cent in 2019. Meanwhile,

both NCPI and CCPI based year-on-year core

inflation, which reflect the underlying inflation

in the economy, remained broadly in mid-single

digit levels in 2019. Inflation expectations of

the corporate sector mostly remained below

mid-single digit levels, aligning well with the

trends of headline inflation. The population growth

moderated in 2019 compared to the growth rate

of 1.1 per cent recorded for the past three years

consecutively. Accounting for the largest share

of elderly dependents within the South Asian

region, Sri Lanka’s ageing population remains

a major challenge, which requires prompt policy

intervention. Although the female labour force

participation rate (LFPR) improved in 2019 in

line with increase in the overall labour force,

Sri Lanka remains among the top 20 countries

with the highest gender gaps in the LFPR. The

overall unemployment rate rose to 4.8 per cent

in 2019, the highest since 2010, mainly due to

the sluggish economic conditions that prevailed

in the country in the aftermath of the Easter

Sunday attacks. Meanwhile, unemployment

among females, youth and educationally qualified

persons continued to remain at high levels,

despite the concerns of labour shortages across

many sectors, underscoring the need for reforms

in the tertiary and vocational education system to

address the skill mismatch as well as to produce

a potent labour force suited for future employment

demand. Moreover, departures for foreign

employment declined further in 2019 continuing

the trend observed since 2015, while a significant

decline of departures for foreign employment

is anticipated in 2020 amidst the spread of the

COVID-19 pandemic.

4.2 Prices

Movements of the General Price Level

The movement of the general price level as

measured by the Consumer Price Indices (CPIs),

largely followed the price behaviour of the items

in the Food category, which mostly recorded

increases during the year. Meanwhile, prices

of the items in the Non-food category increased

continuously during the first nine months of the year,

of which the major contribution to the movement of

the general price level was observed in January

2019 and declined thereafter. Accordingly, the

National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100),1

exhibited a continuous increasing trend from April

onwards during the year 2019. With an exception

observed in July 2019, the Colombo Consumer

Price Index (CCPI, 2013=100), also demonstrated

a trend similar to that of the NCPI.

During 2019, prices of the items in the Food

category, which moved in line with prices of

Volatile Food2 items, declined till March and

increased thereafter. The declining trend of the

prices of the items in the Food category was largely

supported by the price decreases seen in Volatile

1 The Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), compiles two consumer price indices, namely, the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100) and the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI, 2013=100) on a monthly basis. The NCPI demonstrates the price movements of selected consumer items of households at the national level, while the CCPI reflects the same of the urban households in Colombo District.

2 Volatile Food includes rice, meat, fresh fish and sea food, coconut, fresh fruits, vegetables, potatoes, onions and selected condiments.

Food items such as vegetables, coconut, rice,

potatoes and onions. However, prices of Volatile

Food items increased continuously from April 2019

onwards due to intermittent price increases in rice,

vegetables, fresh fish, potatoes, onions and fruits

arising from limited supply conditions. Meanwhile,

prolonged rainy conditions prevailed in the latter

part of 2019 causing severe crop damages,

instigated substantial increases in vegetable prices

in December 2019. When observing the price

movement of the selected Volatile Food items,

prices of rice varieties eased off during the first four

months of 2019, as a result of the bumper harvest

in the 2018/19 Maha season. However, owing to

supply shortages, prices of rice varieties increased

especially during the latter part of the year,

compelling the government to impose a Maximum

Retail Price (MRP) of Rs. 98 on both Nadu and

Samba rice varieties with effect from 19 December

2019. The price of coconut recorded its lowest level

since 2016 supported by the substantial recovery

in coconut production, yet prices were increased

towards the end of 2019. The prices of potatoes

remained at a higher level than that of the previous

year, partially due to the upward revision to Special

Commodity Levy (SCL) by Rs. 30 per kilogramme

with effect from 08 February 2019 and the shortfall

in supply in off seasons. However, the government

reduced the SCL to Rs. 25 per kilogramme with

effect from 25 December 2019 to lessen prices of

potatoes, which were rising from November 2019.

Further, the price of big onions increased from

April 2019 onwards, moderately due to the upward

revision of the SCL by Rs. 20 per kilogramme

with effect from 22 May 2019. However, in view of

protecting the consumer from escalating big onion

prices observed in September 2019, owing to the

export ban on big onions imposed by India, this SCL

was revised downward to Rs. 1 per kilogramme

with effect from 03 October 2019. In addition, red

onion prices, which remained at stable levels during

the most part of 2019, recorded a sharp increase in

the last quarter of the year. Meanwhile, the prices of

fresh fish indicated an overall increasing trend during

2019, mainly due to limited fishing activities caused

by weather related factors.

Within the Food category, prices of the

items excluding Volatile Food items displayed

an overall increasing trend during 2019. A price

revision was imposed on imported milk powder

after a year, revising the price of a 400g packet

upwards by Rs. 25 with effect from 16 March 2019,

followed by two further upward revisions of Rs. 5

and Rs. 20 with effect from 02 August 2019 and

24 September 2019, respectively, considering

price developments in the world market. However,

a downward price revision was made by reducing

the same by Rs. 15 with effect from 09 December

2019. Meanwhile, the prices of dhal and sugar

remained stable during the period under review.

The annual average price of wheat flour was at

Rs. 91, though a MRP of Rs. 87 per kilogramme

of wheat flour was effective from 20 February

2015. Hence, to encourage importation of wheat

flour by more importers, the government removed

the consolidated tax of Rs. 36 per kilogramme on

imported wheat flour, replacing it with a SCL of

Rs. 8 with effect from 14 December 2019.

Prices of items in the Non-food category

followed an overall increasing pattern during

2019, with a slight decrease towards the end of

the year. The sharp monthly increase in the Non-

food category recorded at the beginning of the year

was the highest increase observed after November

2016. It is noteworthy that this was caused by the

significant increase in housing rent, which occupies

a substantial share in both CPI baskets. Further, as

per the pricing formula introduced in 2018, domestic

fuel prices underwent several price revisions in 2019,

exhibiting an overall increasing trend. Accordingly,

petrol (92 octane) and auto diesel prices of Ceylon

Petroleum Corporation (CPC), which were at

Rs. 123 and Rs. 99, respectively, at the beginning

of the year, increased to Rs. 137 and Rs. 104,

respectively, towards the end of 2019. However,

the price of a 12.5kg LP gas cylinder was revised

downwards by Rs. 240 with effect from 04 October

2019. Meanwhile, increases in tuition fees for both

primary and secondary education were observed

at the beginning of the year followed by an increase

in international school fees in September 2019.

The reduction of VAT rate and telecommunication

levy, and the removal of NBT with effect from

01 December 2019, triggered declines in water

of arrack, beer and cigarette, which increased in

March 2019 due to the upward revision of excise

duty on cigarettes and liquor under the budget 2019

continued to remain at elevated levels throughout

the year as the price decreases induced by the

reductions in VAT rate and removal of NBT in

December 2019 were nullified by the subsequent

increase in excise duty.

Consumer Price Indices

National Consumer Price Index

The NCPI followed an increasing trend during

2019 from 127.3 index points in January 2019 to

135.0 index points in December 2019 except in

February and March, which recorded monthly

decreases. Prices of items in the Food category

mostly contributed to the month-on-month movement

of the NCPI, the lone exception being January 2019,

where the observed increase was solely driven by

prices of items in the Non-food category triggered by

the increase in housing rent. The month-on-month

declines of the NCPI observed in February and

March were attributed to the decreases in prices of

items in the Food category, whereas the increases

observed afterwards till September were caused by

the price movements of items in both Food and Non-

food categories. However, the NCPI increased in the

remainder of 2019 owing to the monthly increases of

prices of the items in Food category.

Colombo Consumer Price Index

The CCPI recorded 127.4 index points in

January 2019 and reached 132.4 index points in

December 2019, with the movement mainly driven

by the behaviour of the Food category during the

year. However, the month-on-month movements in

the CCPI in January and August were attributed to

the higher prices of items in the Non-food category

and the movements observed in February, March,

July and during October to December were driven

by the behaviour of the Food category. Meanwhile,

month-on-month escalations in the CCPI observed

from April to June and in September were attributable

to the increases in prices of items in both Food and

Non-food categories.

Headline Inflation

In 2019, the headline inflation as measured

by the year-on-year change in the NCPI followed

an overall increasing trend, while remaining in

low single digit levels in the first eight months

of the year. Afterwards, it fluctuated around the

mid-single digit level in September and October

and declined to 4.1 per cent in November 2019.

Thereafter, the NCPI based inflation reached

6.2 per cent in December 2019, recording the

highest since 2017. Similarly, the year-on-year

CCPI based headline inflation exhibited an

overall increasing trend during the year, mostly

remaining within the range of 4.0-6.0 per cent

and indicating twin peaks in May and October.

Accordingly, the year-on-year CCPI based

headline inflation accelerated from 3.7 per cent

in January 2019 to 5.0 per cent in May 2019,

before declining to 3.3 per cent in July 2019.

The CCPI based headline inflation increased

thereafter reaching 5.4 per cent in October 2019

and recorded 4.4 per cent and 4.8 per cent in

November and December 2019, respectively.

Both the NCPI and CCPI based headline inflation

elevated to higher levels in December 2019

mainly due to higher food prices resulting from

supply disruptions and crop damages caused

by weather disturbances. In addition, the NCPI

based annual average headline inflation remained

relatively stable, yet followed an increasing trend

during the year, recording 1.8 per cent in January

2019 and reaching 3.5 per cent in December

2019. Meanwhile, the annual average CCPI

based headline inflation remained steady during

2019, recording 4.1 per cent in January 2019 and

reaching 4.3 per cent in December 2019.

Core Inflation

The year-on-year core inflation, which

reflects the demand driven underlying

inflation in the economy, elevated in January

2019 mainly due to the increase in housing

rentals and remained broadly in mid-single

digit levels thereafter. The year-on-year NCPI

based core inflation moved on an increasing

trend from 5.1 per cent in January 2019 to 6.3

per cent in April 2019 and remained unchanged

in May 2019. Afterwards, it declined to 6.1 per

cent in June 2019 and reached 5.2 per cent in

December 2019. Moving mostly similar to NCPI,

the CCPI based year-on-year core inflation,

increased to 5.5 per cent in January 2019 and

reached 4.8 per cent in December 2019.

Producer Price Inflation

The producer price inflation measured by

the year-on-year change in the Producer's

Price Index (PPI, 2013 Q4=100) displayed an

overall declining trend during 2019, moving

from 5.6 per cent in January 2019 to 3.6 per

cent in December 2019. In contrast, producer

price inflation in the agriculture sub-sector

increased from -6.3 per cent in January 2019 to 1.5

per cent in December 2019. However, producer

price inflation in the manufacturing, and electricity

and water supply sub sectors demonstrated

overall decreases with mixed movements during

the year, recording 12.7 per cent and 1.6 per

cent, respectively, at the beginning of the year

and reaching 4.9 per cent and 0.0 per cent,

respectively, by the end of 2019.

GDP Deflator

The GDP deflator, which measures

the price movements of all domestically

produced goods and services in the

economy, decreased during 2019 compared

to the previous year, mainly due to subdued

price movements observed in agriculture,

industry and services related activities.

Accordingly, the overall GDP deflator decreased

to 2.2 per cent in 2019 compared to 4.3 per cent

in 2018. The agriculture sector deflator declined

from 2.4 per cent, in 2018, to -2.7 per cent, in

2019, while the industry sector deflator decreased

from 5.7 per cent in 2018 to 4.9 per cent in 2019.

Furthermore, the services sector deflator followed

on, decreasing from 5.0 per cent, in 2018, to 4.2

per cent in 2019.

Inflation Expectations

Aligning well with the trends of actual

inflation as reflected by the official price

indices, inflation expectations of the corporate

sector remained mostly below the mid-single

digit level. Meanwhile, the inflation expectations

of the household sector, remained around the upper

bound of the 4.0-6.0 per cent range. The gaps between

long-term and short-term inflation expectations of the

corporate as well as the household sector narrowed

during the period. Fuel price adjustments, political

instability of the country fuelled by the Easter Sunday

attacks and increase in government expenditure due

to elections were noteworthy factors that influenced

high inflation expectations of both corporate and

household sectors. Nevertheless, the removal of

number of taxes, including PAYE and NBT, the

reduction in VAT and favourable domestic supply

side conditions were cited as main reasons for their

low inflation expectations.

4.3 Wages

During 2019, real wages in the public and

informal private sectors increased marginally,

while that of the formal private sector showed

an erosion, compared to 2018. Therefore, the

demand pressure arising from wages on the general

price level remained subdued during the year.

the special allowance and the interim allowance

to the basic salary of the public sector employees

was completed with the final adjustment made in

January 2020.

Private Sector Wages

Nominal wages of employees in the formal

private sector, as measured by the annual

average change in the Minimum Wage Rate

Index (1978 December=100) of employees whose

wages are governed by the Wages Boards Trades,

increased by 2.9 per cent in 2019. This was mainly

driven by the increase of minimum wages in brick and

tile manufacturing, coconut manufacturing, hosiery

manufacturing, match manufacturing and motor

transport trades with effect from February 2019.

However, the real wages of employees in the formal

private sector declined moderately by 1.3 per cent

during 2019, compared to the decline of 3.5 per cent

recorded in 2018. Meanwhile, in early 2019, workers

in the plantation sector initiated a strike demanding a

minimum daily wage of Rs. 1,000 and consequently

Public Sector Wages

The fourth tranche of the special allowance

and the interim allowance of Rs. 10,000

was added to the basic salary of the public

sector employees in 2019. In addition, a new

non-pensionable monthly interim allowance of

Rs. 2,500 was granted to all public sector

employees under the Public Administration

Circular 09/2019 with effect from 01 July 2019.

As a result, the nominal wages of public sector

employees, as measured by the annual average

change in the Public Sector Wage Rate Index

(2016=100),3 increased by 4.7 per cent in

2019 compared to 2018. Accordingly, real

wages of public sector employees increased by

1.1 per cent in 2019, compared to 2018, reversing

the continuous real wage erosion observed during

the past three years. Further, the process of adding

3 Public sector wage rate index was rebased to 2016 (from 2012) in order to capture the changes introduced to the public sector salary structure by the Public Administration Circular No. 03/2016 issued by the Ministry of Public Administration and Management on 25 February 2016.

the basic daily wage was increased to Rs. 700 from

Rs. 500. However, due to termination of the attendance

and productivity allowances that were paid to workers

of the plantation sector, the corresponding increase in

gross salary amounted to Rs. 20 only.

Growth in both nominal and real wages was

observed in the informal private sector, in 2019.

Wages in the informal sector are mostly determined

by the demand and supply in the labour market.

Accordingly, nominal wages of the informal private

sector employees, as measured by the annual average

change in the Informal Private Sector Wage Rate Index

(2012=100), increased moderately by 6.2 per cent in

2019, compared to the increase of 13.2 per cent in the

previous year. Nominal wages in all three sub-sectors,

namely, agriculture, industry and services increased by

9.0 per cent, 5.4 per cent and 5.7 per cent, respectively,

during the period under review. Overall, real wages of

employees in the informal private sector also increased

by 2.6 per cent in 2019.

4.4 Population, Labour Force and Employment

Population

The mid-year population in Sri Lanka was

estimated at 21.8 million in 2019 as per the

mid-year population estimates compiled by the

Registrar General’s Department. The population

growth rate moderated to 0.6 per cent in 2019 from

1.1 per cent recorded for the past three consecutive

years, due to the drop in net-migration during the

period. In terms of the growth in population, the

highest contributions to the total population growth

in 2019 were from the Colombo and Ampara

districts, while the lowest contribution was from

the Mullaitivu district. Meanwhile, the Colombo

and Gampaha districts continued to account for

the highest share of the mid-year population. In

line with the population growth, the population

density also increased marginally to 348 people

per square kilometre in 2019, from 346 people per

square kilometre in 2018. Following the same trend

observed in the recent years, the female population

continued to remain higher than the male population

during the period under review. In 2019, the crude

birth rate and crude death rate were estimated at

14.6 per 1,000 persons and 6.6 per 1,000 persons,

respectively.

The share of elderly dependents in Sri

Lanka is considered to be the highest in the

South Asian region. In 2019, the age category of

65 years and above amounted to 7.8 per cent of

the mid-year population. This is expected to grow

further with dropping fertility rates as exhibited

through the continuous declining trend in crude birth

rates since 2013 and with growing life expectancy

leading towards an inevitable age transition in Sri

Lanka. This demographic shift and the consequent

changes in income and consumption patterns,

economic growth and public finance are expected

to pose a considerable burden on the workforce in

aiding the elderly dependents. In this context, it is

essential to retain the retirees within the economy

and provide them with financial independence by

way of increasing their re-employability in less

intensive employment, while reskilling the youth to

transfer towards more intensive employment.

Labour Force

The labour force, which is the economically

active population,4 rose by 204,252 to 8.592

million in 2019 from 8.388 million reported in

2018, recording a growth of 2.4 per cent. This

growth was largely driven by the increase in the

labour force in the rural sector, which accounted for

the highest share of the total labour force. Moreover,

both male and female labour forces increased during

2019 compared to the previous year. Accordingly,

the female labour force increased by 3.9 per cent

and contributed to 56 per cent of the total increase

in the labour force during the reference period. In

4 Economically active population consists of persons who are employed or unemployed during the reference period of the Quarterly Labour Force Survey conducted by the DCS.

terms of the sector-wise female labour force, a

notable increase was observed in the urban sector,

while marginal increases were observed in rural

and estate sectors. Moreover, the male labour

force increased by 1.6 per cent and contributed to

44 per cent of the total increase in the labour

force during the reference period. The male labour

force in the estate sector increased at a rate of

9.3 per cent followed by the rural sector, which

grew at a rate of 2.3 per cent. The male labour

force in the urban sector recorded a decline of

3.1 per cent during the reference period.

The Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR),

which is the ratio of the labour force to the

household population, improved in 2019.

Accordingly, the LFPR increased marginally to

52.3 per cent during the period under review

from 51.8 per cent recorded in 2018, driven by

the increase in the female LFPR. The increase

in the female labour force and the decline in

economically inactive females led the female

LFPR to increase to 34.5 per cent in 2019 from

33.6 per cent in 2018. Meanwhile, the male LFPR

remained unchanged at 73.0 per cent in 2019

due to the increase in the number of economically

inactive males despite the increase in the male

labour force.

The gender gap in the LFPR decreased to

38.5 per cent in 2019 from 39.4 per cent in the

previous year. Nevertheless, Sri Lanka is still among

the 20 countries that hold the highest gender gaps

in LFPR, worldwide. Even though statistics indicate

higher education levels in Sri Lankan females than

their counterparts, their participation in Science,

Technology, Engineering and Mathematics

(STEM) related education is considered to be

at an unsatisfactory level, impeding the active

participation of females in economic activities.

According to the University Grants Commission

(UGC), in 2018, among the females graduated

from the universities and other higher educational

institutions established under the Universities Act

No. 16 of 1978, as amended, more than 55 per cent

were from the Arts stream, while only 5 per cent

were from the Computer Science and Engineering

streams. In this context, strong attention is needed

to enhance STEM related skills of the females of

Sri Lanka, to improve their employability thereby

enabling them to actively participate in the

development process of the country.

The traditional role of statisticians has evolved over time gradually without major changes. The process of statistics generally includes stages of data collection, data processing and dissemination of final estimates/outcome (Figure B 8.1). Until recently, the most common advancements in the field of statistics focused mainly on the use of statistical software in data processing, while stages of data collection and dissemination of final results remained static. Rapid developments in information technology, however, challenged the traditional role of statisticians as certain statistical functions are becoming increasingly complex.

Meanwhile, data collection methods continued to evolve over time without being a limiting factor in the process of statistics. Traditional methods such as survey through questionnaires, one-to-one or phone interviews and secondary data from published sources are still being used as official sources for statistics produced by any organisation due to their reliability and customisability. However, over time, these traditional data collection methods experienced constraints not because of intrinsic features of such methods, but due to the widening horizons of digitalisation coupled with high frequency data generated through various means and platforms. These high frequency data get accumulated in various formats around cyber space, but, until recently, alternative uses of such data have not been adequately explored.

Data processing plays a vital role in obtaining a refined set of estimates, which is used for decision-making. Data collected using traditional methods and processed manually are currently being analysed using

BOX 8Breaking Stereotypes: How Digitalisation will Impact the Traditional Process of Statistics

various statistical packages. Mathematical modelling software is commonly being used to build up statistical relationships among variables. 'Official Statistics', which are national level statistical outcomes, comprise key economic indicators and a series of estimates related to economic activities. Around the world, this process of compiling official statistics is followed under various limitations and assumptions in assessing the status of an economy. Despite its limitations, the traditional process of compiling statistics has gained validation and reliability over time as it is based on scientific methodology.

The term ‘Big Data’ came to light in this backdrop when the traditional statistical process was challenged by a wave of digitalisation, coupled with the rise of information and communication technologies. In simple terms, digitalisation of the economy refers to the use of digital technology for various economic activities and Big Data refers to the accumulation of high frequency data from non-traditional sources for the use of economic agents. Despite that these concepts originated in early 2000’s, most of the terminology used in relation to Big Data lack universally accepted definitions1. Nevertheless, its usage seems to have encompassed over a wider spectrum as different online platforms on the World Wide Web generate a large part of Big Data while cashier terminals of supermarkets, automated vending machines, surveillance camera units, etc., also gather massive volumes of data on a daily basis. This data is originally recorded for a particular purpose and Big Data becomes a by-product of that process. Because of its recording frequency, such data becomes an incredible source, which outperforms most of the traditional data sources used in the statistical process in terms of volume and speed.

How digitalisation has inﬂ uenced ofﬁ cial statistics

With the emergence of Big Data, one of the concerns raised by users was its eligibility to replace official statistics. As most of the data used in the statistical processes are primarily collected for a designated purpose, relying on secondary data through unorthodox means is still a challenging move to be taken by statisticians. In the present context, statistics generated using these unconventional data is called ‘Smart Statistics’ and are used as an alternative stream to complement official statistics. One of the benefits of maintaining a supportive stream of statistics is that it can help to validate official statistics, and also over time smart statistics will contribute towards continuously improving the quality of the entire statistical process

within an organisation. For instance, a survey on Big Data in central banks2 carried out in 2019 shows that central banks around the world have identified Big Data as an auxiliary input into policy-making processes (Figure B 8.2).

The biggest impact of digitalisation on the statistical universe is its capability to transform a highly fractionalised and disconnected organisation in terms of data sharing into a centralised data warehouse, which promotes a brand new ‘data culture’ among all the members. Digitalisation demands everyone who uses the data to know the entire process of statistics, which extends from data collection to final estimates. In the case of central banks, the analytical departments will need to equip their staff with necessary programming skills to exploit the Big Data available in their ‘Data Lake’3. Anyone who has access to the Data Lake, irrespective of their area of expertise, will need the skill-set of a data analyst to get the maximum benefit from digitalisation.

What digitalisation has in offer for statisticians

Digitalisation contributes to the field of statistics at each stage of its traditional process, from data collection to the final outcome. The traditional data collection methods would be replaced/supported by data digitally collected using methods such as Web Scraping and Text Mining. Web Scraping, in simple terms, refers to the process of extracting specific data available on relevant web sites by using programming software. Central banks around the world have started projects on scraping price and other data recorded on various web sites to support their monetary policy-setting process, which include forecasting inflation using price data, labour force dynamics of the economy through various job market web sites, and identifying the unorganised sector contribution to the national output through web sites related to Barter/Sharing economy.

3 Data Lake – A system or a repository of data stored in its natural/raw format. Available at: https://aws.amazon.com/big-data/datalakes-and-analytics/what-is-a-data-lake/

Text Mining is another digital technique, which is commonly used to evaluate the momentum of a community before or after a certain policy change takes place. This technique can identify a pool of key words related to people’s sentiments and track such words on various social media platforms to identify the frequency of their use. This will provide an estimate on the direction of public expectations of a policy or any other targeted phenomenon.

Ongoing projects of central banks, which use web scraping and text mining are focused on different areas. The Sveriges Riksbank (Central Bank of Sweden) uses data scraped from grocery retailers’ websites as a tool of error correction in inflation forecasting. The Central Bank of Armenia collects house prices displayed online by real estate agents to compile a house price index. The Deutsche Bundesbank (Central Bank of Germany) uses web data to capture depositors’ sentiments by means of text mining the queries related to the term “deposit insurance”, which provides them with an understanding about the depositors’ confidence in the banking sector of Germany. The European Central Bank, the Bank of England (Central Bank of the United Kingdom), the Banque de France (Central Bank of France) and other regulatory institutions around the world have started various projects in the area of Big Data and digitalisation, as the use of Big Data collected through web scraping and text mining is often advantageous over the conventional survey data because of the high velocity and high volume.

The contribution of digitalisation to the data processing stage is the most sophisticated and complicated element of the entire process of smart statistics. One of the differences between the traditional job of statisticians and the digital process is that both data collection and processing run on software using programming languages thereby leading to limited manual intervention in the digital process. In an advanced setting, the human element would be further reduced with the use of ‘Machine Learning’ and ‘Artificial Intelligence’ that will capture algorithms in data and carryout analytical tasks autonomously.

Data visualisation is the final stage of the statistical process, which converts the statistical estimates to graphical and other means of presentation. Official statistics, which are traditionally presented through tables, reports and graphs will be generated using tools such as visualising dashboards, which graphically and illustratively present the key statistical estimates. These dashboards are interactive and could be tailored to the needs of individual users. Central banks in their transformation towards being digital are exploring the potential of using these visualising dashboards for managerial decision-making in the policy-setting process.

Digital footprint: Smart statistics in the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) also embarked on its digitalisation journey in the field of statistics with a few pilot projects (Figure B 8.3). The high exchange rate volatility observed during the latter part of 2018, underscored the need to assess the degree of exchange rate pass-through to the consumer items. In this regard, CBSL took initiatives to adopt web scraping to collect prices of imported food and beverage items posted online on a daily basis. With the success of this project, CBSL increased the number of food and beverage items, of which the prices are collected by web scraping daily, as a pilot project to develop a leading indicator to strengthen the inflation forecasting process.

Since early 2019, in order to overcome the bottlenecks in data collection for compilation of the Land Price Index, which was based on valuations obtained from the Government Valuation Department semi-annually for residential, commercial and industrial lands in Colombo District, CBSL launched a pilot project to collect the market prices of properties advertised online, through web scraping on a monthly basis. Accordingly, CBSL is developing an Asking Price Index for lands in Colombo District and intends to expand it to the entire country. Moreover, a House Price Index for residential housing properties covering the entire country and a Condominium Price Index covering properties in the Colombo District are being compiled using scraped data. Additionally, a House Rental Price Index is also expected to be constructed using web scraped data to understand the status of the rental market and its impact on household expenditure dynamics.

CBSL has initiated another pilot project for forecasting near-term inflation using Machine Learning by employing a multi-step time series with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The bank further uses visualisation dashboards to present the national accounting estimates, which are annually compiled for the provincial level. The use of visualisation dashboards is becoming popular within CBSL as they complement the official statistical reports used for decision-making.

Challenges for central banks and Way forward

With the rise of digitalisation across economies, central banks are concerned with the use of data analytics and other technologies for the policy-setting process. One of the key challenges in digitalising the statistical processes is to develop the skill-set within organisations for economists, statisticians, mathematicians to use the specific software/programming languages and the top management to be ‘tech-savvy’. Digitalisation of statistics will demand individuals with a strong mathematical background to solve complex issues and open up opportunities for data scientists to be a part of statistical departments.

Digitalisation will require changes to the existing regulatory and infrastructure frameworks to facilitate adoption of new technologies. Access rights to privately owned web spaces in terms of legality and possible blockage imposed by the administrators of such web sites are also key concerns. Access rights to some domains are already given at a premium and the cost effectiveness of paying for such data is another concern for statisticians as traditional data collection methods could be relatively inexpensive in certain instances.

Another commonly discussed issue is the reliability of data extracted from secondary sources. Irrespective of the high volumes and velocity, regulators are reluctant to base policy decisions entirely on digital sources. It is identified that statisticians in public agencies have an agitation towards using certain web-based technologies mostly because of disclosure risks and cyber security threats. Most of these technologies demand ‘Cloud-based’ data warehousing, which may enhance exposure to data security risk.

Developing economies such as Sri Lanka will have to focus on establishing digital infrastructure platforms and regularising the use of digital technology in economic activities by introducing governance frameworks, which is a priority area even for CBSL at present. Considering these limitations and challenges faced by the central banks worldwide, digitalisation of statistical processes is still at its early stages of the life cycle, and central banks carry the view of using it as an alternative stream rather than fully migrating to smart statistics. However, the transformation is already happening at a faster rate. Therefore, conventional statistical processes will need to be geared to embrace the new challenges ahead, to ride the tide together with the rest of the world.

The employed population increased by

2.1 per cent to 8.181 million in 2019 compared

to 8.015 million in the previous year. In terms of

sectoral employment, the services sector, which

is the foremost employment generator, accounted

for 47.1 per cent of the total employment

followed by the industry and agriculture sectors

contributing to 27.6 per cent and 25.3 per cent

of the total employment, respectively, during

the period. Meanwhile, employment in all three

sectors showed an increase in 2019 from 2018,

where the services sector accounted for the

highest share of 71.4 per cent of the total increase

in employed population.

The employed population in the categories of

the public sector, private sector and own account

workers increased during 2019 compared to the

previous year. In terms of the employment status,

the employed population is categorised into two

major categories, namely, waged and salaried

workers (employees) and the self-employed.

The employees category is further categorised

into public sector and private sector, while the

self-employed category is categorised into

employers, own account workers and contributing

family workers. Out of these categories, the

highest contribution to the total increase in the

employed population during the reference period

was from the waged and salaried workers, for

which both public and private sector employees

together contributed to 63.6 per cent of the

total increase in the employed population. In

addition, own account workers contributed to

43.9 per cent of the total increase in the employed

population. Meanwhile, the number of employers

and contributing family workers declined by

5.4 per cent and 0.05 per cent, respectively,

during 2019 compared to the previous year. In

terms of the share in the employed population,

the share of public sector employees and own

account workers increased, while that of private

sector employees, employers and contributing

family workers decreased during the reference

period. Nevertheless, the private sector continued

to remain the main employment generator in

Sri Lanka representing the largest share of

43.0 per cent followed by own account workers,

which accounted for 32.5 per cent of the total

employment.

As per the Public Sector Employment

Survey conducted by the Central Bank,

total public sector employment increased to

1.434 million at the end of 2019, compared

to 1.424 million in 2018. This includes

employees in ministries, departments, district

secretariats, divisional secretariats, provincial

councils and semi-government institutions. A

considerable growth is anticipated in public

sector employment in 2020 as well, with the

government initiatives on offering public sector

employment for graduates and those who are

from low income families with qualifications

below GCE O/L.

Even though education is the foundation

towards employability, a significant portion

of youth in Sri Lanka still do not receive

adequate formal, tertiary and vocational

education. Even though Sri Lanka provides

free primary and secondary education for

every child, tertiary and other higher education

opportunities in the country are inadequate to

address the knowledge and skill gaps of the

labour force. Supporting the fact, statistics of the

UGC confirms that only around 20 per cent of

GCE A/L qualified students get the opportunity

to enter into the universities and other higher

educational institutions established under the

Universities Act No. 16 of 1978, as amended,

in Sri Lanka. The rest, who are unable to

connect with other tertiary and vocational

education institutes due to lack of awareness,

affordability as well as uneven distribution of

those institutes, are left behind and pushed

towards easy short-term earnings and informal

employments. This underutilised labour force is

one key reason for labour shortages in industries

such as construction and tourism, where those

entities are compelled to import labour from

other countries. Under these circumstances, it

is essential to improve human capital utilisation

in Sri Lanka by way of directing the potential

labour force towards available opportunities,

while widening the capacity of the tertiary and

vocational education system.

Unemployment

The unemployed population increased

by 10.4 per cent to 0.411 million in 2019,

compared to 0.373 million reported in the

previous year. This increase was primarily

driven by the increase in the unemployed male

population by 13.0 per cent during the reference

period, besides the increase in the unemployed

female population by 8.3 per cent. Meanwhile,

the overall unemployment rate increased to

4.8 per cent in 2019 from 4.4 per cent recorded

in the previous year. Correspondingly,

the male and female unemployment rates

increased considerably by 0.3 per cent each to

3.3 per cent and 7.4 per cent, respectively,

during 2019 compared to the previous year. The

female unemployment rate continued to remain

at a significantly high level, which was more than

twice the male unemployment rate, doubting the

adequacy of employability skills within the female

labour force of the country.

Unemployment rate among most of the

age categories increased during 2019

compared to the previous year. Youth (15-24

years) unemployment rate, which continued

to be at higher levels, recorded 21.5 per cent

during 2019, which was a marginal increase from

21.4 per cent recorded during the previous year.

In addition, it is noteworthy that the youth category

accounted for the highest share, of 49 per cent,

of the total unemployed population during the

reference period. More than one fifth of the

youth labour force being unemployed indicates

the urgent need of capitalising the unutilised

capacity in the youth on economic growth and

development of the country by properly directing

them to fill gaps in the labour market. Meanwhile,

the age categories of 25-29 years, 30-39 years

and 40 years and above reported unemployment

rates of 11.0 per cent, 3.1 per cent and 1.2 per cent,

respectively, during the reference period.

In terms of the education level, the GCE

A/L and above category continued to record

the highest unemployment rate, which

was 8.5 per cent, during 2019. Moreover, it

accounted for 42 per cent, the highest share

of the total unemployed population during the

reference period. Meanwhile, the unemployment

rates of the GCE O/L and Grade 6-10 categories

stood at 6.5 per cent and 3.3 per cent, respectively,

during 2019. The prevailing high level of youth

unemployment among the educationally qualified

in Sri Lanka is attributable to shortfalls in producing

a labour force that meets the demand of the labour

market. According to the statistics of the UGC for

the year 2018, 48 per cent of the total graduate

output of universities and other higher educational

institutions established under the Universities Act

No. 16 of 1978, as amended, were from the Arts

stream, whereas only 4 per cent were from the

Computer Science stream, clearly reflecting the

misalignments between the output of the higher

education system and labour market requirements

in Sri Lanka. This shortfall of producing a

youth labour force with employability skills is

expected to widen further with the changes in the

employment landscape in line with developments

in contemporary technologies. On this note, with

the view of developing an efficient and effective

human resource pool that can contribute towards a

dynamic economic growth and development of the

country, there is a pressing need for reforms in the

higher education system in order to integrate the

industry needs and national development plans of

Sri Lanka.

Foreign Employment

Continuing the trend observed since 2015,

departures for foreign employment weakened

further in 2019. The departures for foreign

employment declined by 3.9 per cent to 203,186

in 2019 from 211,459 in 2018. This decline was

mainly caused by the decline in male departures

for foreign employment by 5.8 per cent to 122,201

in 2019 from 129,774 in 2018. In addition, female

departures for foreign employment also declined

marginally by 0.9 per cent to 80,985 in 2019 from

81,685 in 2018. Meanwhile, departures for foreign

employment under all skill categories except for

the professional category and the semi-skilled

category declined in 2019. The decline observed

in the middle level, clerical and related, skilled

and unskilled categories during the reference

period were also mostly instigated by the decline

in male departures. It is noteworthy that the

decline in the skilled category, which was by

6.5 per cent compared to 2018, contributed to

52.4 per cent of the total decline in departures

for foreign employment in 2019. Moreover,

the housemaid category, which declined by

5.2 per cent compared to 2018, contributed to

40.7 per cent of the total decline in departures

in 2019. Despite the decline, the housemaid and

unskilled categories still account for the majority

of the departures for foreign employment.

Meanwhile, the significant increase of 36.8 per cent

in the professional category and the increase of

6.5 per cent in the semi-skilled category during

the reference period were mainly driven by male

departures, particularly, by those who were aged

between 30-34 years.

The Middle East region continued to remain

the main foreign employment destination for

Sri Lanka accounting for around 85.0 per cent

of the total departures for foreign employment.

Accordingly, 97.0 per cent under the housemaid

category and 71.8 per cent under the unskilled

category were concentrated in Middle Eastern

countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait

and the UAE. In terms of gender-wise departures,

80.0 per cent of male departures for foreign

employment and 92.5 per cent of female departures

for foreign employment were concentrated in

the Middle East region. Meanwhile, a downfall in

departures for foreign employment is anticipated in

2020, resulting from the travel restrictions, amidst

the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Middle

East region.

Sri Lanka should focus more towards catering

to the international labour demand related to

the professional, skilled and semi-skilled

categories in light of the decline in demand for

low skilled labour in the international labour

market. The recent developments in technology,

which have revolutionised the way of work,

have a considerable impact on migrant workers.

Accordingly, the displacement of blue-collar jobs

due to automation and robotics and emergence

of digital collar jobs have reformed the skills

demanded in labour markets. In addition, there

is a structural transformation in the international

labour market in terms of remote as well as

temporary work assignments. In this context,

Sri Lanka has been experiencing a continuous

decline in worker remittances since 2017 in

line with the decline in worker remittances from

the Middle East region, where the majority of

Sri Lankan housemaids and unskilled workers

are concentrated. Worker remittances being

one of the major sources of foreign exchange

earnings that have a large impact on the Sri

Lankan economy, more weight should be given

to improve digital and high tech skills of the

domestic workers in order for them to become

more competitive in the international labour

market.

The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign

Employment (SLBFE) continued to implement

measures to regulate the migration

process, protect and empower migrants and

their families and link migration with the

development process, with the vision of

becoming the best choice for competent human

resources in the overseas market. Accordingly,

ensuring trustworthy foreign employment for Sri

Lankan migrant workers, the SLBFE conducted

252 raids on illegal recruitment activities and filed

461 court cases against non-licensed persons who

were engaged in foreign employment business as

well as the licensed agencies that violated the law,

during 2019. As welfare and protection measures,

in 2019, the SLBFE paid Rs. 132.33 million as

insurance premium on behalf of 201,806 migrant

workers and Rs. 104.46 million for 2,885 persons

under the insurance scheme with regard to

repatriation, death claims and medical claims for

dependents, incurred a cost of Rs. 121.59 million

in awarding scholarships to 4,846 children of

migrant workers, provided financial assistance for

66 needy migrant workers utilising the Workers’

Welfare Fund (WWF) of the SLBFE and repatriated

a total of 40 migrant workers due to the issues

they encountered during their stay abroad utilising

Rs. 1.29 million of the WWF and Rs. 0.92 million

under the insurance scheme. In addition, the

SLBFE repatriated 1,669 stranded migrant workers

through Sri Lanka missions in labour receiving

countries without financial involvement during

2019. In order to upgrade the quality of domestic

labour, the SLBFE provided the NVQ level III

qualification for 5,981 job seekers. Furthermore,

a specified skilled worker recruitment programme

was implemented following the memorandum of

corporation (MOC) between the governments of

Sri Lanka and Japan signed in 2019 to provide

employment opportunities for Sri Lankan skilled

workers in Japan covering 14 occupational

categories during 2019. Currently, a database of

eligible persons is being prepared to be sent to

Japan. In addition, the SLBFE sent 115 technical

interns to Japan during 2019 under the MOC

signed between governments of Sri Lanka and

Japan in 2018 for sending Sri Lankan job seekers

to Japan as technical interns.

Labour Relations and Labour Market Reforms

Labour relations in the private sector

improved during 2019 compared to 2018 with

the decline in number of strikes and number

of workers involved in strikes. However, the

number of man days lost due to strikes increased by

10.7 per cent during the period under review

compared to 2018. As per the data reported by

the Department of Labour, the number of strikes,

workers involved in strikes and man days lost due to

strikes in the plantation sector declined significantly

during 2019 compared to the previous year. In

semi-government institutions and other private

institutions, the number of strikes and the number

of workers involved in strikes declined, though man

days lost due to strikes increased in 2019 compared

to the previous year. A total of 18 strikes were

reported in private sector industries during 2019, of

which 7 were related to the plantation sector and the

rest were related to semi-government institutions

and other private institutions. Overall, 6,952

workers were involved in strikes in 2019, of which

28.1 per cent were from the plantation sector and

71.9 per cent were from semi-government

institutions and other private institutions.

Meanwhile, a total of 54,919 man days were

lost due to strikes during 2019, of which

51.4 per cent was in the plantation sector and

48.6 per cent was in semi-government institutions

and other private institutions. In addition to these

strikes, the publicly available data revealed a number

of strikes in sectors such as health, customs, postal,

education and transportation, which had a negative

impact on the daily lives of the general public and

the social and economic activities of the country.

Several measures were taken by the Ministry

of Skills Development, Employment and Labour

Relations to improve industrial harmony during

2019. Accordingly, during the meetings of National

Labour Advisory Council, it was agreed to amend

sections 2(a) of the Wages Board Ordinance

No. 27 of 1941 to provide for the trade union dues

check off to be made an authorised deduction

and the National Minimum Wage of Workers Act

No. 3 of 2016 to increase the minimum wage by

Rs. 2,500. It was also proposed to establish a

mechanism to fix wages with technical assistance

from International Labour Organization (ILO).

Further, Sri Lanka ratified the protocol 29 (P29) of

2014 to the forced labour convention (C29), 1930,

which provides guidelines for member countries

to address gaps in implementation of convention

and to strengthen the measures to achieve

effective and sustained suppression of forced or

compulsory labour. In addition, the Department

of Labour continued to conduct social dialogue

awareness programmes to improve employee-

employer relationships at factory floor level as well

as an island-wide competition on the basis of social

dialogue and workplace cooperation to award the

best work-places in the plantation, manufacturing,

garment and services sectors. Moreover, several

amendments/legal provisions were also introduced

in the sphere of labour relations. Accordingly, an

amendment was brought into the Wages Board

Ordinance No. 27 of 1941 to enhance and regularise

contract employment. In addition, several regulations

related to the registration of factories and approval

of factory buildings, registration and examination of

steam boilers and other pressure vessels, protection

of workers from excessive noise and general

standard of lighting were introduced to Factories

Ordinance No. 45 of 1942 to improve the health and

safety of the working environment. Amendments to

the Employees Provident Fund Act No. 15 of 1958

for making employer mandated to furnish information

with regard to A, B, H forms to Department of Labour

and the Employment of Women, Young Persons and

Children Act No. 47 of 1956 to increase the minimum

age of employment from 14 to 16 years, giving

coherence to increasing compulsory education up to

16 years are in progress.

Labour Productivity

Labour productivity measured in terms

of Gross Value Added (GVA) (in 2010 prices)

per hour worked increased to Rs. 513.39 per

hour worked in 2019 compared to Rs. 503.04

per hour worked in 2018. Accordingly, the overall

labour productivity improved by 2.1 per cent in 2019

compared with 2018. Increase in the GVA in all three

sectors, namely agriculture, industry and services,

and decrease in hours worked in agriculture and

industry sectors contributed towards this increase

in the overall labour productivity. In terms of the

level of productivity, the services sector exhibited

the most efficient use of labour resource, recording

the highest labour productivity level of Rs. 624.58

per hour worked, followed by the industry sector

with labour productivity level of Rs. 540.70 per hour

worked. Even though a gradual increase in labour

productivity could be observed in the agriculture

sector, it recorded the lowest labour productivity

level of Rs. 192.87 per hour worked during 2019.

Agriculture sector in Sri Lanka is still

considered to be highly labour intensive,

despite the gradual decline of the share of

employment. In this context, moving towards high

tech agriculture from the traditional agriculture

is essential to address the issues relating to high

labour dependency and inefficiencies in resource

usage in the agriculture sector. Moreover, with

the emergence of the new challenge of COVID-19

pandemic, disruption in global food supply chains

has surfaced the need of improving agriculture

productivity in Sri Lanka more than before, as

Sri Lankan economy depends on some major

agricultural imports due to self-insufficiency and

high cost associated with the agriculture produces

in Sri Lanka.

Since early 2019, in order to overcome the bottlenecks 
in  data  collection  for    compilation  of  the  Land  Price 
Index,  which  was  based  on  valuations  obtained  from 
the  Government  Valuation  Department  semi-annually 
residential,  commercial  and 
Colombo  District,  CBSL  launched  a  pilot  project  to 
collect the market prices of properties advertised online, 
through web scraping on a monthly basis. Accordingly, 
CBSL  is  developing  an  Asking  Price  Index  for  lands  in 
Colombo District and intends to expand it to the entire 
country. Moreover, a House Price Index for residential 
housing  properties  covering  the  entire  country  and  a 
Condominium  Price  Index  covering  properties  in  the 
Colombo  District  are  being  compiled  using  scraped 
data.  Additionally,  a  House  Rental  Price  Index  is  also 
expected to be constructed using web scraped data to 
understand the status of the rental market and its impact 
on household expenditure dynamics. 
CBSL has initiated another pilot project for forecasting 
near-term inflation using Machine Learning by employing 
a  multi-step  time  series  with  Long  Short-Term  Memory 
(LSTM). The bank further uses visualisation dashboards 
to present the national accounting estimates, which are 
annually  compiled  for  the  provincial  level.  The  use  of 
visualisation  dashboards  is  becoming  popular  within 
CBSL as they complement the official statistical reports 
used for decision-making.","","","","","","","be","","‘tech-savvy’.  Digitalisation  of  statistics  will  demand","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
