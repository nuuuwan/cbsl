methods would be replaced/supported by data digitally 
collected  using  methods  such  as  Web  Scraping  and 
Text  Mining.  Web  Scraping,  in  simple  terms,  refers  to 
the  process  of  extracting  specific  data  available  on 
relevant  web  sites  by  using  programming  software. 
Central banks around the world have started projects on 
scraping price and other data recorded on various web 
sites  to  support  their  monetary  policy-setting  process, 
which  include  forecasting  inflation  using  price  data, 
labour force dynamics of the economy through various 
job  market  web  sites,  and  identifying  the  unorganised 
sector contribution to the national output through web 
sites related to Barter/Sharing economy.
