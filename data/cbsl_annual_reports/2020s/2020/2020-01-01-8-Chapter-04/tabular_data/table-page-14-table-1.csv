"Digital  footprint:  Smart  statistics  in  the  Central 
Bank of Sri Lanka
With  the  rise  of  digitalisation  across  economies,  central 
banks  are  concerned  with  the  use  of  data  analytics  and 
The  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  (CBSL)  also  embarked 
other technologies for the policy-setting process. One of 
on its digitalisation journey in the field of statistics with 
the key challenges in digitalising the statistical processes is 
a few pilot projects (Figure B 8.3). The high exchange

Since early 2019, in order to overcome the bottlenecks 
in  data  collection  for    compilation  of  the  Land  Price 
Index,  which  was  based  on  valuations  obtained  from 
the  Government  Valuation  Department  semi-annually 
residential,  commercial  and 
Colombo  District,  CBSL  launched  a  pilot  project  to 
collect the market prices of properties advertised online, 
through web scraping on a monthly basis. Accordingly, 
CBSL  is  developing  an  Asking  Price  Index  for  lands  in 
Colombo District and intends to expand it to the entire 
country. Moreover, a House Price Index for residential 
housing  properties  covering  the  entire  country  and  a 
Condominium  Price  Index  covering  properties  in  the 
Colombo  District  are  being  compiled  using  scraped 
data.  Additionally,  a  House  Rental  Price  Index  is  also 
expected to be constructed using web scraped data to 
understand the status of the rental market and its impact 
on household expenditure dynamics. 
CBSL has initiated another pilot project for forecasting 
near-term inflation using Machine Learning by employing 
a  multi-step  time  series  with  Long  Short-Term  Memory 
(LSTM). The bank further uses visualisation dashboards 
to present the national accounting estimates, which are 
annually  compiled  for  the  provincial  level.  The  use  of 
visualisation  dashboards  is  becoming  popular  within 
CBSL as they complement the official statistical reports 
used for decision-making.","","","","","","","be","","‘tech-savvy’.  Digitalisation  of  statistics  will  demand","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Developing  economies  such  as  Sri  Lanka  will  have  to 
focus  on  establishing  digital  infrastructure  platforms  and 
regularising  the  use  of  digital  technology  in  economic 
activities  by  introducing  governance  frameworks,  which

these limitations and challenges faced by the central banks 
worldwide, digitalisation of statistical processes is still at its 
early stages of the life cycle, and central banks carry the 
view of using it as an alternative stream rather than fully 
migrating to smart statistics. However, the transformation is 
already happening at a faster rate. Therefore, conventional","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
