5.1 OverviewS

ri Lanka’s external sector remained

resilient in 2019 despite heightened

domestic vulnerabilities. A substantial

contraction in the trade deficit along with healthy

inflows to the services account resulted in a surplus

in the external current account in the first quarter of

2019. However, the current account was adversely

affected by the developments following the Easter

Sunday attacks, which impacted the tourism sector,

in particular. With the gradual widening of the trade

deficit especially towards the end of the year, and

the decline in earnings from tourism and workers’

remittances, the current account turned to deficit

levels from the second quarter of 2019. However,

the annual deficit remained significantly below the

deficit in 2018. The overall contraction in the trade

deficit in 2019 was driven by a significant reduction

in the expenditure on merchandise imports, which

was primarily due to the policy induced reduction

in the importation of gold and motor vehicles. The

healthy growth in merchandise exports observed in

the first half of 2019 reversed in the second half,

resulting in an overall modest growth in export

earnings in 2019. Export growth in 2019 was

primarily driven by the increase in exports of textiles

and garments. The surplus in the services account

was adversely affected by a significant decline in

tourist earnings and transport earnings from air

passenger services following the Easter Sunday

attacks. The deficit in the primary income account

widened marginally during the year with increased

reinvested earnings and dividend payments by

direct investment enterprises while the surplus in

the secondary income account contracted with the

moderation of workers’ remittances.

The financial account of the Balance of Payments

(BOP) was augmented with significant inflows

during the year. Proceeds from the issuances of

International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) amounting

to US dollars 4.4 billion as well as the receipt of

two tranches of the International Monetary Fund’s

Extended Fund Facility (IMF - EFF) were the major

inflows to the financial account in 2019. However,

other flows to the financial account remained

moderate due to subdued levels of Foreign Direct

Investments (FDI), while foreign investment in the

government securities market and the Colombo

Stock Exchange (CSE) recorded net outflows. The

government made large debt repayments in 2019,

including the settlement of maturing ISBs amounting

to US dollars 1.5 billion, amortisation payments of

foreign currency term financing facilities and the

settlement of maturing Sri Lanka Development

Bonds (SLDBs). Despite these debt repayments,

gross official reserves strengthened in 2019 from

US dollars 6.9 billion at end 2018 to US dollars 7.6

billion by end 2019. The increase in gross official

reserves relative to reserve related liabilities was

also reflected in the overall balance, which recorded

a surplus of US dollars 377 million by end 2019.

The Central Bank continued to maintain flexibility

in the determination of the exchange rate during

the year. The Sri Lankan rupee, which recorded

a significant depreciation in 2018, appreciated

marginally by 0.6 per cent against the US dollar in

2019. The relative stability in the exchange rate can

be mainly attributed to the contraction in the trade

deficit. The conducive conditions in the domestic

foreign exchange market also permitted the Central

Bank to purchase foreign exchange on a net basis

to build up gross official reserves. An intermittent

volatility was witnessed in the domestic foreign

exchange market in the aftermath of the Easter

Sunday attacks and when domestic and external

uncertainties resulted in some outflows of foreign

investment from the government securities market.

The external sector is likely to be under significant

pressure in 2020. The cessation of almost all domestic

economic activities from the latter part of March

2020 due to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic,

including export oriented manufacturing, a complete

standstill of the tourism industry with restrictions on

global travel, lockdowns in many countries impacting

global supply chains and merchandise trade and

the flight of capital from emerging markets have

already impacted Sri Lanka’s external sector in the

first quarter of 2020. The significant uncertainty

arising from the COVID-19 outbreak also impacted

the domestic foreign exchange market, with a sharp

depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee in March 2020.

The Central Bank and the government introduced

urgent measures to mitigate the pressure on the

foreign exchange market, including a temporary

suspension of the importation of selected motor

vehicles and non-essential consumer goods for

three months. Overall, the extent of spread of the

COVID-19 both domestically and globally will

ascertain the performance of the current account

and the financial account of the BOP in 2020,

with the possibility of speculative volatilities in the

domestic foreign exchange market amidst significant

debt servicing challenges. In the medium to long

run, maintaining the current account deficit at a

sustainable level as well as building external buffers

are of utmost importance in order to ensure the long

term stability of the external sector. The foreign

financing requirement will also increase, if there

are spillover effects of running significantly large

fiscal deficits. In this context, immediate attention

should be given to finance near term external debt

obligations through some bridging financing, as

emerging and developing market economies’ access

to global capital markets will remain restrictive due

to the pandemic. In the medium term, measures to

facilitate export oriented manufacturing and services

are needed to attract non-debt creating foreign

exchange earnings.

5.2 External Trade Policies, Developments and Institutional Support

The government continued to focus on

greater trade integration and enhancement

of institutional support for trade facilitation

and export promotion during 2019. Although

discussions on improvements to regional trade

agreements continued, bilateral negotiations on

proposed comprehensive free trade/ partnership

agreements with China, India and Thailand were

not held during 2019. In addition, in 2019, a

review process was carried out on the Sri Lanka

- Singapore Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA),

that came into force in May 2018. Measures were

taken to mitigate potential negative effects that can

emerge with trade liberalisation, including a Trade

Adjustment Programme (TAP), mainly through the

market access programme and operationalisation

of the Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties Act,

No.2 of 2018 and Safeguard Measures Act No. 3 of

2018. Further, the Export Development Board (EDB)

continued the implementation of the National Export

Strategy (NES) 2018-2022. As per the requirements

of the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) of the

World Trade Organization (WTO), progress related

to the National Single Window (NSW) continued

during the period under review. Reflecting the

impact of such measures, Sri Lanka’s rank in the

Ease of Doing Business Index in 2020 improved to

99 from 100 in 2019 (111th in 2018), while further

improvements are expected with the implementation

of supportive policy reforms in the period ahead.

Sri Lanka continued to benefit from the

Generalised System of Preference (GSP)

arrangements in 2019. Among the GSP facilities

received by Sri Lanka, the facility offered by the

EU and the USA contributed to more than two

thirds of total preferential exports of Sri Lanka.

Since the reinstatement of the EU GSP+ scheme

in May 2017, some growth in exports to the EU

was observed. Sri Lanka was able to gain this

benefit due to the removal of duties on 66 per cent

of total tariff lines of the EU under the EU GSP+

scheme. Garments, rubber products, tea, seafood,

food, beverages and tobacco, and machinery and

mechanical appliances were the main categories

exported under this scheme in 2019. However,

having reached the ‘upper middle-income’ status

as classified by the World Bank in 2019, eligibility

for the GSP+ and the standard GSP scheme of the

EU could lapse by 2023. Meanwhile, the apparel

sector, the main beneficiary of the EU GSP+

scheme, continued to struggle to meet the country

of origin requirements to qualify for preferential

access through this scheme, hindering the growth

of apparel exports. In this regard, the government

made several requests from the EU in collaboration

with the governments of Indonesia and South

Korea in 2018, seeking permission to use material

sourced from these countries eligible to be used

by Sri Lankan apparel sector under the cumulation

rule of the EU GSP+, and these requests are

currently being considered by the EU. Meanwhile,

exports under the US GSP scheme, which

accounted for 14.3 per cent of total exports under

preferential agreements, increased marginally in

2019. Garments, rubber products, food, beverages

and tobacco, tea and chemical products were the

main export categories under the US GSP scheme

in 2019. The current US GSP scheme will be

effective until the end of 2020 and is expected to

be re-authorised as per the general practice of the

US government. In addition, Sri Lanka continued

to benefit from GSP schemes offered by several

other countries such as the Russian Federation,

Japan, Australia, Turkey, Canada and Switzerland,

although, their contribution to exports remained

relatively low. Meanwhile, export earnings of

Sri Lanka under the Global System of Trade

Preferences (GSTP) Agreement, which mainly

exported cinnamon to Mexico and Peru, declined

in 2019. The narrow export base and low product

penetration are obstacles to Sri Lanka's ability to

entirely exploit the benefit from most GSP schemes.

Further rounds of negotiations in relation to

new trade agreements stalled in 2019, although

discussions on bilateral trade improvements

progressed. Sri Lanka had completed several

rounds of negotiations on three comprehensive

free trade/ partnership agreements with China,

India (Economic and Technology Cooperation

Agreement - ETCA) and Thailand by the beginning

of 2019. The official bilateral negotiation rounds

were not held during 2019 for these new free

trade/ partnership agreements, amidst political

tensions. Although discussions were held at the

political level with the Chinese government on

the recommencement of the negotiations of the

China - Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (CSFTA),

official negotiation rounds failed to resume after

the sixth round held in March 2017. Meanwhile,

negotiations on the proposed ETCA between India

and Sri Lanka completed 11 rounds by September

2018. Accordingly, negotiations on two chapters,

'Customs Procedure' and 'Trade Facilitation and

Trade Remedies', were completed successfully

and the draft chapters have been sent to the

respective Ministries for finalisation. Negotiations

on the Sri Lanka - Thailand FTA (SLTFTA), which

commenced in July 2018, did not resume after the

second round of negotiations held in September

2018. With the expectation of improving trade in

services, investment and business opportunities

through global value chain (GVC) operations with

Singapore, Sri Lanka signed its first comprehensive

bilateral FTA in January 2018, which came into

force in May 2018. However, amidst concerns

raised by several stakeholders over the SLSFTA,

a Committee of Experts was appointed in August

2018, to further analyse the FTA. Accordingly,

the committee submitted its report in November

2018. Subsequently, a five-member Cabinet

subcommittee was appointed, which prepared its

initial report specifying the areas that need to be

revised in SLSFTA as well as pending concerns

that need to be further discussed with relevant

domestic institutions. Meanwhile, initial studies

and discussions on several potential FTAs with

Malaysia, Indonesia and Bangladesh continued

during 2019. Other than bilateral FTAs, several

discussions on economic cooperation were carried

out with Hungary, Australia, Germany and New

Zealand, while joint committees and commissions

with the EU, Thailand, Kuwait, Vietnam were held

during 2019. Since December 2019, duties and

functions on multilateral, bilateral and economic

conventions have been assigned to the Ministry

of Finance, Economic and Policy Development.

Accordingly, after reviewing the overall

macroeconomic policy of the country, including

its existing FTAs and those under negotiations,

future undertakings will be taken by the Ministry of

Finance, Economic and Policy Development.

Measures were taken to further enhance

the utilisation of existing bilateral trade

agreements, considering relatively low trade

volumes under these FTAs. The India - Sri Lanka

Free Trade Agreement (ISLFTA) had been the

most beneficial bilateral FTA for Sri Lanka. Under

this, exports of Sri Lanka improved marginally to

US dollars 490 million in 2019 in comparison to

US dollars 484 million in 2018. Approximately, 64

per cent of Sri Lanka’s exports to India, which is

led by animal feed, spices, garments and base

metals and articles were channelled through the

FTA, compared to around 5 per cent of imports

amounting to US dollars 199 million from India

under the FTA. Further measures were taken

to resolve issues related to the implementation

of ISLFTA, such as quantitative restrictions

on apparel and black pepper, procedures on

customs clearance and sample testing, excessive

documentation charges and delays. ETCA could

take over ISLFTA when negotiations are finalised.

Meanwhile, exports under the Pakistan - Sri Lanka

Free Trade Agreement (PSFTA) increased by 19.1

per cent to US dollars 61 million during 2019. Major

products exported by Sri Lanka under the PSFTA

included betel leaves, coconut kernel products and

medium-density fibre (MDF) boards. Despite the

low trade volumes, exports through the PSFTA

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

169

5

remained high at around 74 per cent, while imports

through the PSFTA were low at around 6 per cent

amounting to US dollars 24 million. Lack of product

diversification, ad hoc policy changes and non-tariff

barriers such as procedural delays hindered the

trade volumes under this Agreement. Nevertheless,

it is evident that with regard to ISLFTA and

PSFTA, Sri Lanka has maintained a favourable

trade balance in 2019. Meanwhile, the 13th joint

council meeting under the USA - Sri Lanka Trade

and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA)

was held in Colombo in June 2019. Following

the detailed deliberations, the US counterparts

expressed willingness to offer their cooperation in

providing technical assistance for capacity building

and skill development in several areas, including

improvement of Sri Lanka’s ranking in the ‘Ease of

Doing Business Index’.

Engagement with regional preferential trade

agreements needs to be further strengthened

given the importance of enhancing cooperation

among regional trade and services networks.

The Agreement on the South Asian Free Trade Area

(SAFTA), signed in 2006, is expected to replace

the SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement

(SAPTA). This resulted a reduction in the utilisation

of SAPTA, while exports through SAFTA improved

during 2019. Exports to India dominated with

over 83 per cent of export earnings of Sri Lanka

under SAFTA being driven by desiccated coconuts

and pepper. The first and second phases of the

tariff liberalisation programme (TLP) of SAFTA

were completed by Sri Lanka in 2015 and 2018,

respectively, and during 2019, stakeholder

consultations were held to identify tariff lines to

implement the tariff reduction commitment under

the third phase. Exports under the Asia - Pacific

Trade Agreement (APTA) increased in 2019, led

by tea, garments and coconut related products

exported mainly to China. Sri Lanka implemented

the fourth round of concessions in March 2018

and the participating states are now engaged in

formulating the modalities and terms of references

(TORs) for the fifth round of APTA negotiations.

Meanwhile, several discussions on the proposed

FTA of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-

Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation

(BIMSTEC-FTA) were held in 2019. The draft TLP

of Sri Lanka was prepared by the Department of

Commerce and circulated among stakeholders for

their observations.

Sri Lanka’s multilateral trade engagements

with the WTO continued along with the

implementation of the WTO’s Trade Facilitation

Agreement (TFA). During 2019, Sri Lanka actively

engaged with the WTO disciplines relevant to

fisheries subsidies, agriculture, e-commerce and

electronic transfers, domestic regulations and

reforms to modernise the WTO. Since the TFA

came into effect in February 2017, Sri Lanka

notified its commitments to the WTO as specified

under the categories “A”, “B” and “C”. Several

stakeholder consultations and awareness sessions

were held in 2019 to improve the utilisation of

the Trade Information Portal (TIP), which was

launched in July 2018, in fulfilment of Sri Lanka’s

commitments under TFA. Meanwhile, designing

the National Single Window (NSW) for Sri Lanka

Customs (SLC) was in progress and its blueprint

was handed over to the Ministry of Finance and to

SLC by the World Bank in July 2019.

Initiatives were taken by the government

to streamline the institutional capacity with a

view to facilitating external trade. The Trade

Adjustment Programme (TAP), a major outcome

of the New Trade Policy (NTP) was introduced

in 2017 to support the smooth transition of firms

and workers to liberalised trade conditions. The

Cabinet of Ministers approved the establishment

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

170

5

of the Trade and Productivity Commission (TPC)

and a Joint Steering Committee in March 2019

to implement the TAP in a productive manner.

Initiatives were taken to draft a bill to empower the

TPC, which is set to play a crucial role in the trade

liberalisation process by bridging the gap between

industries and the government. Meanwhile,

operationalising of the NES 2018-2022, which was

launched in July 2018, continued during 2019.

Accordingly, a NES Management Unit consisting

of several advisory committees with representation

from the private and public sectors was established

under the Ministry of Industrial Exports and

Investment Promotion (MIEIP) (formerly Ministry

of Development Strategies and International

Trade) and the EDB to coordinate, monitor and

report on the implementation of the plan of actions

of the NES. By the end of 2019, the NES had

made considerable progress across all of its focus

sectors and trade supporting functions. Meanwhile,

the EDB, continued initiatives, such as the market

access support scheme, IT initiative, multinational

corporation outreach programme for the electrical

and electronic components sector, establishment

of infrastructure facilities and establishment

of an EDB owned trade promotion platform

(eMARKETPLACE). Further enhancements were

undertaken to national programmes to transform

2,000 regional small and medium enterprises

(SMEs) as new export champions, promotion

of women entrepreneurs, the “One Village One

Product” concept and creation of direct and

indirect exporters in the identified regions. The

selected exporters benefitted from awareness

programmes, domestic and foreign trade fair

visits and technical assistance. Under the market

access support programme, which was designed

to support enterprises to expand their market

access through value addition and improved

productivity, about 100 proposals were selected

by the EDB by the end of 2019. In addition, the

EDB took several measures including qualifying

the Geographical Indication (GI) sign for “Ceylon

Cinnamon” to further develop cinnamon exports.

The Trade Chambers also contributed towards

export promotion, which helped link the public and

private sector stakeholders in policymaking and

grievance handling. Meanwhile, SLC streamlined

its activities further in line with the implementation

of the TFA of the WTO during 2019. Accordingly,

a system based post clearance audit was

implemented, which allows SLC to further simplify

customs procedures, minimise cost of facilitation

while maintaining internal controls. Further, SLC

took measures to prevent garbage, scrap and

waste entering Sri Lankan borders. Meanwhile,

the import cargo clearance was fully automated in

July 2019.

Measures were taken by the government

to implement trade related proposals of the

Budget 2019, while restricting the importation

of selected items to protect domestic farmers

and industries. The Budget 2019 proposed to

continue phasing out para-tariffs on selected items

over a period of five years. In addition, further

funds were allocated for the ongoing trade reform

programmes such as the TAP, NES, Export Market

Access Programme and further development of

the industrial zones proposed in Bingiriya and

Wagawatte. In December 2019, directions were

issued to restrict the importation of selected items

as a measure of protecting domestic farmers and

industries. Accordingly, the importation of spices

such as pepper, mustard, tamarind, cinnamon,

nutmeg, mace, cardamom, ginger and cloves with

the purpose of direct re-export or re-export after

minor preparation was restricted. Further, the

importation of Vesak lanterns, kites and incense

sticks was restricted mainly due to the impact

importation of ethanol for liquor production was

also suspended. In addition, the government and

the Central Bank undertook urgent measures to

mitigate the pressure on the external sector that

arose due to the COVID-19 outbreak, including a

suspension on facilitating the importation of selected

motor vehicles and non essential consumer goods

in March 2020, initially for a period of three months.

Domestic and global impediments would

continue to challenge Sri Lanka’s trade

performance, while policy consistency, extended

institutional support and macroeconomic

stability would be required for improving trade

performance in the period ahead. Although

several domestic and international challenges

arose during 2019, a significant improvement

was observed in the trade deficit mainly resulting

from lower import expenditure derived by policy

measures introduced to curtail excessive imports

of consumer goods of a non-essential nature.

Protectionism measures taken by major players of

global trade, the Brexit, Sri Lanka losing EU GSP/

GSP+ towards 2023 due to the graduation to upper-

middle income status and the recent outbreak of the

Covid-19 disrupting demand and supply networks

would be the key challenges in the period ahead.

The ongoing trade disputes between major players

of the global trade arena are not expected to impact

Sri Lanka’s trade performance in a significant way,

although the possible slowdown in global trade and

growth could have a spillover effect on Sri Lanka’s

trade performance. Trade related developments

of regional peers such as the withdrawal of the

US GSP facility from India and Vietnam’s new

FTA with the EU could also have an impact on

the performance of Sri Lankan exports. Further

strengthening of existing trade relations while

establishing affiliations with new trading partners,

conducive and consistent external trade policies,

institutional support through capacity development,

careful liberalisation of trade together with a broadly

stable macroeconomic environment are expected

to drive the growth momentum in exports. The

opportunities, challenges and remedial measures

to be taken on external trade have been widely

accepted by almost all stakeholders. Priority should

be given to removing supply side constraints such

as high production costs and lack of required labour,

creation of an export culture supported by Research

and Development (R&D) led innovation to harness

potential global value chains and product networks,

improving value addition, the rationalisation of the

institutional framework, removing bureaucratic

bottlenecks and creating a trade and investor friendly

environment. Further, Sri Lanka must move further

towards sustainable production concepts such as

organic produce, green production and fair trade

practices, where such practices are highly valued

by consumers around the world. Accordingly,

the timely implementation of identified strategies

is imperative while continuing the dialogue with

stakeholders for new strategies. Special attention

should be paid to resolve the risks attached to Sri

Lanka’s graduation into an upper middle income

country, through advanced planning.

5.3.1 Export Performance

Earnings from merchandise exports

continued its growth in 2019, albeit marginally,

amidst heightened domestic and external

vulnerabilities. Earnings from merchandise

exports increased at a higher rate during the first

half of the year, but decelerated thereafter, limiting

the year-on-year export growth to 0.4 per cent.

Accordingly, earnings from merchandise exports

recorded US dollars 11,940 million in 2019 in

comparison to US dollars 11,890 million in 2018.

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

Earnings from industrial exports contributed to the

increase in export earnings, while earnings from

agricultural and mineral exports declined.

Earnings from industrial exports, which

accounted for around 79 per cent of total export

earnings, increased in 2019, predominantly

supported by the growth in exports of textiles

and garments. Accordingly, industrial exports

increased by 1.8 per cent to US dollars 9,426 million

in 2019 from US dollars 9,258 million in 2018. Being

the largest contributor to exports, earnings from

textiles and garments increased by 5.2 per cent

to US dollars 5,596 million in 2019. Earnings from

garment exports to the USA in 2019 increased by

3.0 per cent to US dollars 2,338 million. Garment

exports to the EU also showed an increase of 4.9

per cent to US dollars 2,153 million, benefitting

from the restoration of GSP+ facility, while the

UK, being the largest single buyer within the EU,

accounted for US dollars 747 million. In addition,

Italy, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands in

the EU as well as Canada, Australia, China, India

and Japan, were among the largest buyers of Sri

Lankan garments in 2019. Earnings from textiles

and made up textile articles also increased in 2019

due to increased demand from India, the UK, the

USA, Germany and Pakistan. Meanwhile, export

earnings from gems, diamonds and jewellery

grew by 10.0 per cent to US dollars 306 million in

2019, recovering from the low amount of export

earnings recorded in 2018. Earnings from transport

equipment increased by 21.3 per cent to US dollars

146 million, with a significant increase in export

earnings from ships, boats and floating structures,

reflecting mainly the supply of a naval craft to

Japan. Earnings from chemical products exports

also increased by 5.7 per cent, driven by exports

of activated carbon. Further, export earnings from

base metals and articles increased by 6.7 per

cent, mainly due to the increase in export earnings

from iron and steel and articles. Earnings from

animal fodder increased, driven by exports of

residues from food industries, while earnings from

printing industry products increased with exports

of currency notes. In contrast, earnings from

petroleum products exports, which mainly comprise

bunker and aviation fuel, declined by 16.2 per cent

to US dollars 521 million in 2019. Lower export

volumes driven by the high competition between

bunkering ports in the region and cancellation of

several flights following the Easter Sunday attacks

as well as lower prices caused the decline in export

earnings from bunker and aviation fuel. Exports of

other petroleum products, including lubricants and

petroleum bitumen, also declined in 2019. Despite

the increase in earnings from rubber glove exports,

earnings from rubber product exports declined

by 1.1 per cent to US dollars 866 million during

2019, driven by lower tyre exports. Earnings from

machinery and mechanical appliances exports

declined by 8.0 per cent to US dollars 400 million due

to low export earnings from most sub categories,

despite higher export earnings from machinery

and equipment parts. In addition, earnings from

food, beverages and tobacco exports declined, led

by lower manufactured tobacco exports, while all

exports of sub sectors under leather, travel goods

and footwear also declined during 2019.

Performance of agricultural exports, which

accounted for around 21 per cent of total

exports, deteriorated further in 2019. Earnings

from agricultural exports declined by 4.6 per cent

to US dollars 2,462 million in 2019 in comparison to

2018, driven by lower earnings from tea and spice

exports. Earnings from tea exports, the second

largest contributor to the total export earnings of Sri

Lanka, accounting for 11.3 per cent, declined by

5.7 per cent to US dollars 1,346 million in 2019.

However, the volume of tea exported increased by

3.6 per cent to 293 million kilograms in 2019 from

282 million kilograms in 2018, indicating that the

decline in earnings from tea exports was entirely

driven by lower average export prices. The average

tea export price in 2019 declined by 9.1 per cent

to US dollars 4.60 per kg from US dollars 5.06 per

kg in 2018, although the average auction prices

were relatively high at the Colombo tea auction

compared to the Kolkata (India) and Mombasa

(Kenya) auctions. Turkey continued to secure

the number one importer position for Sri Lankan

tea, both in terms of value and volume. As in the

previous year, Russia, Iraq, Iran and Syria remained

the other major tea export destinations in value

terms, altogether accounting for 42 per cent of total

tea export earnings in 2019. Earnings from spice

exports declined by 13.2 per cent to US dollars 313

million in 2019, mainly due to lower export volumes

of cinnamon and pepper, despite the increase in

earnings from cloves, nutmeg and mace with higher

domestic supply. Earnings from seafood exports

declined by 1.3 per cent in 2019, mainly due to the

significant decline in demand from the US market,

despite increased demand from the EU market.

In addition, earnings from natural rubber exports

declined considerably, led by lower crepe rubber

exports, while earnings from unmanufactured

tobacco exports declined marginally in 2019. In

contrast, earnings from coconut exports increased

by 6.0 per cent to US dollars 330 million, due to

higher export volume of coconut kernel products,

led by desiccated coconuts, and non-kernel exports

such as coconut fibre, despite lower prices. In

addition, earnings from fresh vegetables and minor

agricultural products such as papaw, mangoes,

areca nuts and betel leaves exports increased in

2019 in comparison to the previous year.

Earnings from mineral exports declined by

1.4 per cent to US dollars 34 million in 2019.

Despite the increase in earnings from ores, slag

and ash, led by the export of titanium ores, the

decline in earnings from earths and stone exports

led to the overall subdued performance in mineral

exports.

5.3.2 Import Performance

Following the policy measures implemented

by the government and the Central Bank to

dampen non-essential imports during the latter

part of 2018, the expenditure on merchandise

imports declined considerably in 2019,

reversing the growth trend observed in the

preceding three years. Accordingly, expenditure

on imports declined by 10.3 per cent to US dollars

19,937 million in 2019 from US dollars 22,233

million in 2018. Lower expenditure on consumer

goods and intermediate goods mainly contributed

to the decline in imports in 2019, while expenditure

on investment goods also declined marginally.

Meanwhile, import expenditure, excluding fuel

imports, declined by 11.3 per cent to US dollars

16,045 million in 2019.

Import expenditure on intermediate goods,

which accounted for 57 per cent of total imports,

declined by 9.0 per cent to US dollars 11,370

million in 2019 in comparison to the previous

year. Expenditure on fuel imports declined by

6.3 per cent to US dollars 3,892 million in 2019

due to the drop in import prices of all subsectors;

crude oil, refined petroleum and coal as well as the

import volume of refined petroleum. In line with the

reduction in oil prices in the international market, the

average crude oil import price declined to US dollars

68.80 per barrel in 2019 from US dollars 76.25 per

barrel in 2018. Expenditure on diamonds, precious

stones and metals imports exhibited a considerable

decline due to the reduction in gold imports during

2019, following the imposition of customs duty of

15 per cent on gold imports in April 2018. Import

expenditure on base metals declined by 17.6 per

cent in 2019, driven by lower iron and steel imports.

Expenditure on wheat imports declined due to lower

import volumes, despite the growth in average

wheat import prices, while expenditure on fertiliser

imports declined, led by lower import volumes of

Urea. Most other sub categories of intermediate

goods imports, including plastic and articles

thereof, chemical products, paper and paperboard

and articles thereof, food preparations, rubber

and articles thereof, and vehicle and machinery

parts, also showed a declining trend. However,

expenditure on textiles and textile articles, driven by

fibre and fabrics imports, increased in 2019, in line

with the increased exports of textiles and garments.

In addition, expenditure on mineral products imports

increased, led by the substantial increase in cement

clinker during 2019 compared to the previous year.

Expenditure on consumer goods imports,

which accounted for about 20 per cent of total

imports, declined substantially with the decline

in expenditure on both food and beverages

and non-food consumer goods. Accordingly,

expenditure on consumer goods imports declined

by 20.5 per cent to US dollars 3,957 million in 2019

compared to US dollars 4,980 million in 2018. Import

expenditure on food and beverages declined by 11.2

per cent, as a result of lower imports of main food

categories except seafood, vegetables and spices.

Expenditure on rice imports, which is categorised

under cereals and milling industry products,

declined significantly due to lower import volume in

2019 compared to 2018. Accordingly, the volume

of rice imports declined to 24 million kilograms in

2019 from 249 million kilograms in 2018, led by

an improved domestic paddy harvest in 2019. The

considerable decline in import volumes of sugar

and average import prices led the expenditure on

sugar and confectionery imports to decline by 19.4

per cent in 2019. Further, expenditure on dairy

products declined by 6.1 per cent in 2019, led by

lower import volumes of milk powder, despite a

marginal increase in average import prices of milk

powder. In addition, expenditure on imports of oils

and fats led by coconut oil, fruits, led by processed

fruits, and beverages led by alcoholic beverages

imports also declined in 2019 when compared to

2018. However, expenditure on seafood imports

increased by 8.8 per cent to US dollars 215 million

in 2019, led by increased imports of canned fish.

In addition, expenditure on vegetable imports

increased with increased expenditure on garlic,

masoor dhal, big onion and potatoes, while

expenditure on spices increased moderately, as a

result of higher import prices of chillies in 2019.

The decline in the expenditure on non-food

consumer goods imports was mainly due to

the considerable decline in the expenditure

on personal vehicle imports. Expenditure on

personal vehicle imports declined significantly

by 48.2 per cent to US dollars 816 million

from the record high level of US dollars 1,574

million in 2018, reflecting the impact of policy

measures implemented during the latter part of

2018 to discourage imports of personal motor

vehicles. Responding to policy measures, the

importation of personal vehicles has decelerated

since December 2018. During the first half of

2019 expenditure on personal vehicle imports

declined by 60.1 per cent to US dollars 324

million compared to the corresponding period of

2018. However, in the Budget 2019 presented in

March 2019, excise duties on selected personal

motor vehicle categories were further increased,

creating some space for selective relaxation of

the macroprudential measures taken to curtail

excessive vehicle imports in 2018. Accordingly,

restrictions such as the margin deposit requirement

and the suspension of importing vehicles under

letters of credit (LCs), using concessionary

permits were removed during March / April 2019.

As a result, import expenditure on personal motor

vehicles picked up during the second half of 2019 to

US dollars 491 million, driven by the resumption of

vehicle importation under concessionary permits.

Restrictions imposed on selected non-essential

consumer goods, such as the margin requirement

and restriction on foreign currency release for the

importation of such goods, were also removed

in March 2019. However, contractions were

recorded in the expenditure on importation of

clothing and accessories (11.3 per cent), home

appliances (11.0 per cent), telecommunication

devices (9.3 per cent), rubber products (12.9 per

cent) and cosmetic and toiletries (8.4 per cent) in

2019 in comparison to 2018. In contrast, import

expenditure on medical and pharmaceuticals, led

by medicaments, and expenditure on household

and furniture, led by plastic kitchenware imports,

increased in 2019 in comparison to the previous

year. However, in order to ease the pressure on the

exchange rate and prevent financial market panic

due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government

and the Central Bank undertook urgent measures,

including a temporary suspension on facilitating

the importation of motor vehicles and non essential

consumer goods in March 2020. Accordingly,

the Central Bank directed licenced commercial

banks and the National Savings Bank to suspend

facilitating the importation of selected motor

vehicles under LCs and the importation of selected

non-essential consumer goods under LCs,

Documents Against Acceptance and Advanced

Payment terms.

Expenditure on investment goods, which

accounted for about 23 per cent of total import

expenditure, declined marginally with lower

expenditure on all major sub categories.

Accordingly, expenditure on investment goods

imports declined by 1.9 per cent to US dollars

4,603 million in 2019 from US dollars 4,690

million in 2018. Expenditure on machinery and

equipment declined marginally by 0.1 per cent to

US dollars 2,490 million. This reflected the decline

in expenditure on machinery and equipment parts,

office machines, telecommunication devices and

textile industry machinery imports, offsetting the

increase in expenditure on medical and laboratory

equipment, electric motors and generating sets and

engineering equipment imports. Expenditure on

transport equipment imports declined considerably

by 10.7 per cent, due to the decline in expenditure

on almost all subcategories of commercial vehicles,

ships and boats, aircraft and parts of aircraft,

although import expenditure on railway engines,

carriages and other railway equipment increased

substantially in 2019. Despite the significant

increase in articles of iron and steel, led by the

import of bridge construction material, expenditure

on building material imports declined by 1.0 per

cent to US dollars 1,509 million in 2019, due to

the decline in imports of many items in other sub

categories such as iron and steel, cement, plastic,

rubber and glassware, wood products, ceramic

products, mineral products and insulated wires and

cables, reflecting the overall slowdown in economic

activities in 2019.

5.3.3 Trade Balance

The deficit in the trade account, which

expanded continuously for the previous five

years, contracted substantially in 2019. This

was due to lower expenditure on imports resulting

from policy measures taken to curtail non-essential

consumer goods during the latter part of 2018 as

well as the marginal increase in earnings from

exports. Accordingly, the trade deficit contracted

considerably by US dollars 2,346 million to US

dollars 7,997 million in 2019 compared to US dollars

10,343 million in 2018. This was the lowest deficit

since 2013. The trade deficit as a percentage of

GDP contracted to 9.5 per cent in 2019 from 11.7

per cent in 2018.

5.3.4 Terms of Trade

The terms of trade, which represent the ratio

between Sri Lanka's export prices and import

prices, deteriorated in 2019. The export price

index declined by 6.3 per cent to 94.1 index points,

while the import price index declined by 4.8 per

cent to 90.5 index points during the year. As the

export price index declined at a higher pace than

the decline in the import price index, the terms of

trade deteriorated by 1.6 per cent to 103.9 index

points in 2019 in comparison to 105.6 index points

in 2018.

Reflecting lower prices of all major

categories of exports, the overall export price

index declined in 2019. The export price index

pertaining to industrial exports declined by 5.4 per

cent during the year, mainly due to the decline in

prices of petroleum products by 14.7 per cent in

line with lower prices in the international market.

Further, prices of base metals and articles and wood

and paper products declined by 18.9 per cent and

17.9 per cent, respectively. In addition, price indices

for machinery and mechanical appliances, gems,

diamonds and jewellery, and textiles and garments

declined during the period. However, price indices

pertaining to transport equipment, chemical products

and rubber products, categorised under industrial

exports, increased in 2019. Meanwhile, the price

index for agricultural exports declined by 9.5 per cent

in 2019, mainly driven by price reductions reported

in the traditional export commodities, namely, tea,

rubber and coconut. The price index for tea declined

by 9.3 per cent, while the price indices for rubber

and coconut also declined by 14.8 per cent and

20.8 per cent, respectively. Price indices pertaining

to spices, unmanufactured tobacco and seafood

also declined, while price indices for vegetables and

minor agricultural products increased during the

year. The price index pertaining to mineral exports

also declined marginally by 0.2 per cent during 2019

in comparison to 2018.

The overall import price index declined in

2019 mainly due to low prices pertaining to

intermediate goods and investment goods

imports. The import price index of intermediate

goods declined by 5.3 per cent, due to price

reductions recorded in almost all subcategories,

except the price index of vehicle and machinery

parts. The price index for fuel declined by 5.8 per

cent, while prices of base metals and plastic and

articles thereof declined by 11.2 per cent and 7.5 per

cent, respectively. In addition, prices of agricultural

inputs, rubber and articles thereof, diamonds,

precious stones and metals, wheat and maize and

fertiliser declined during the period. The price index

in respect of investment goods declined by 3.4 per

cent in 2019 compared to the previous year, mainly

due to the decline in prices of machinery and

equipment and building materials by 4.6 per cent

and 2.5 per cent, respectively. However, import

prices of transport equipment increased by 4.2 per

cent in 2019. Even though the import price index

for food and beverages declined, the import price

index for consumer goods increased marginally

by 0.2 per cent due to the 5.7 per cent increase

recorded in the prices of non-food consumer

goods. Within the non-food consumer goods

category, the price index for vehicles increased by

12.3 per cent, while price indices for clothing and

accessories, household and furniture items and

rubber products also increased. However, prices of

telecommunication devices, home appliances and

medical and pharmaceutical imports declined during

2019. The import price index pertaining to food and

beverages declined by 4.5 per cent, mainly due to

the decline in prices of cereals and milling industry

products and sugar and confectionery by 21.9 per

cent and 10.9 per cent, respectively. Import price

indices pertaining to oils and fats, dairy products

and vegetables also declined. However, import

prices pertaining to seafood and spices increased

during the period under consideration.

major trading partner of Sri Lanka in 2019, followed

by China and the USA, all of which together

contributed around 40 per cent of total trade of

Sri Lanka. However, total trade with India, which

exceeded US dollars 5 billion in 2018, declined to

US dollars 4.7 billion in 2019. Trade with China also

declined but remained above US dollars 4 billion

as in the previous year, and trade with the USA

exceeded US dollars 3 billion. The United Arab

Emirates (UAE), the UK, Japan, Singapore and

Germany were the other major trading partners,

which accounted for total trade to the value of more

than US dollars 1 billion each in 2019. The decline

in total trade with India in 2019 was due to a notable

reduction in imports and moderate reduction in

exports in comparison to 2018. Total trade with

China dropped owing to a decline in imports from

China. In addition, total trade with the UAE, Japan,

Singapore and Germany also declined in 2019 in

comparison to 2018. In contrast, total trade with the

USA and the UK increased due to the combined

effect of increased exports and imports with these

countries in 2019 in comparison to 2018. Western

countries, mainly the USA and the UK, continued

to be the major destinations for Sri Lankan exports

in 2019 as well, while Asia, mainly China and India,

towered over the rest with respect to imports to Sri

Lanka.

The USA remained the single largest buyer

of Sri Lankan exports. The share of total export

earnings from the USA increased to 26.3 per cent

compared to 25.9 per cent in 2018. Export earnings

from the USA increased by 1.8 per cent to US

dollars 3,141 million in 2019, mainly due to exports

of garments, rubber products, base metals, food,

beverages and tobacco and tea, which accounted

for about 87 per cent of total exports to the USA.

The USA continued to be the single largest

garment export destination for Sri Lanka as well,

accounting for about 45 per cent of total garment

exports in 2019. However, earnings from seafood

exports to the USA declined considerably by 37.9

per cent in 2019, while earnings from machinery

and mechanical appliances, spices and coconut

kernel products exports to the USA also declined.

The UK, as the second largest export destination,

accounted for 8.4 per cent of Sri Lanka’s exports

with around 14 per cent of Sri Lanka’s garments

being exported to the UK. Export earnings from

the UK increased in 2019 by 1.8 per cent to US

dollars 998 million due to increased earnings on

account of garments, machinery and mechanical

appliances made up textile articles transport

equipment and seafood, rubber products and tea.

However, food, beverages and tobacco, coconut

products and spice exports to the UK declined in

2019. Total exports to India, the third largest buyer

of Sri Lanka’s exports accounting for 6.4 per cent

of total exports, declined by 1.1 per cent to US

dollars 768 million in 2019 from US dollars 777

million in 2018. This decline mainly emanated from

the decline in earnings from exports of petroleum

products, garments, base metal and articles, and

machinery and mechanical appliances. However,

animal fodder, coconut kernel products, textiles

and tea exports to India increased in 2019.

Meanwhile, exports to Germany, which accounted

for 5.4 per cent of total exports, increased by 5.5

per cent in 2019. Garments, rubber products and

tea, which accounted for around 70 per cent of

total exports to Germany, largely contributed to

the increase in export earnings from Germany in

2019. Italy, which accounted for 4.4 per cent of

total export earnings remained the fifth largest

export destination of Sri Lanka, despite a decline

in export earnings by 7.7 per cent in 2019, mainly

due to a decline in garments, rubber products and

gem, diamonds and jewellery and tea exports,

which accounted for about 89 per cent of total

exports to Italy. Exports to the EU, being the most

dominant region for Sri Lankan exports accounting

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

for about 30 per cent of total exports, increased by

2.2 per cent to US dollars 3,552 million in 2019.

Increased export earnings from garments, seafood

and transport equipment, which accounted for 65

per cent of total exports to EU, largely contributed

to this increase, reflecting the positive impact of the

restoration of the EU GSP+ facility and the removal

of the ban on exports of fisheries products to the

EU. In 2019, the Middle East and Commonwealth

of Independent States (CIS) led by Russia were

the main export destinations for Sri Lanka’s tea

exports. They contributed 42 per cent and 17 per

cent, respectively, of total tea export earnings,

despite registering a decline in tea exports to these

countries.

China regained its position as the main

source of imports of Sri Lanka in 2019, for the

second time since 2016. China accounted for

a notable share of 20.2 per cent of total import

expenditure in 2019 in comparison to the share of

18.5 per cent recorded in 2018. However, import

expenditure from China declined by 2.0 per cent

to US dollars 4,034 million in 2019, mainly due

to lower imports of telecommunication devices,

base metals and chemical products. Major imports

from China during the year 2019 were textiles

and textile articles, machinery and equipment and

building material, which accounted for 64 per cent

of import expenditure from China. India and the

UAE followed as the second and the third import

sourcing countries in 2019, recording US dollars

3,899 million (accounting for 19.6 per cent of total

imports), and US dollars 1,669 million (accounting

for 8.4 per cent), respectively. With respect to

India, main imports comprised textiles and textile

articles, petroleum products, building material,

machinery and equipment and chemical products,

which altogether accounted for 51 per cent of total

imports from India. Major imports from the UAE

were petroleum products, mineral products and

base metals, which accounted for 88 per cent of

total imports from the UAE. Singapore and Japan

were the fourth and fifth largest import sourcing

countries, accounting for 4.8 per cent and 4.4

per cent of total imports, respectively, in 2019.

Expenditure on imports from Singapore declined

significantly by 29.7 per cent to US dollars 964 million

in 2019, decreasing its share of total imports to 4.8

per cent from 6.2 per cent in 2018, mainly due to

the considerable reduction in imports of petroleum

products. Major imports from Singapore in 2019

consisted of petroleum products, machinery and

equipment and chemical products, accounting for

89 per cent of import expenditure from Singapore.

Expenditure on imports from Japan declined by 44.8

per cent to US dollars 875 million in 2019, reducing

its share to 4.4 per cent from 7.1 per cent in 2018

mainly due to the reduction in imports of personal

motor vehicles. Major imports from Japan during

2019 were personal motor vehicles, transport

equipment, and machinery and equipment, which

accounted for 79 per cent of imports from Japan.

5.4 Current and Capital Account

5.4.1 Trade in Services

The services account was significantly

affected by the Easter Sunday attacks in 2019.

The surplus in the trade in services account

recorded a notable decline in 2019, primarily

due to the reduction in earnings from the tourism

and transport sectors during this period. During

2019, earnings from tourism and air passenger

transport services declined due to the impact of

the Easter Sunday attacks, while earnings from

telecommunication services, computer services and

other services increased during the year. Overall,

earnings from export of services declined by 10.7

per cent to US dollars 7,474 million in 2019 from US

dollars 8,374 million in 2018. Meanwhile, outflows

from the services account recorded a marginal

increase of 0.4 per cent to US dollars 4,625

million during the year, with other services outflows

including insurance, financial, telecommunication

and computer services recording an increase while

expenditure on personal travel abroad, passenger

transport services recorded a decline during

the year, following the Easter Sunday attacks.

Meanwhile, the computer services sector continued

its growth momentum during 2019. Reflecting

these developments, the surplus in the services

account declined to US dollars 2,849 million in

2019 compared to a surplus of US dollars 3,766

million recorded in 2018.

Transport Services

The surplus in transport services contracted

due to reduced air passenger transport services

in 2019. Gross inflows of transportation services,

which consist of passenger fares, freight charges,

port and airport related activities, amounted to

US dollars 2,339 million in 2019 compared to

US dollars 2,486 million in 2018. The reduction is

largely explained by the decline in air passenger

transport services following the Easter Sunday

attacks. However, sea transport services recorded

a modest growth amidst a growth in freight earnings.

Meanwhile, outflows on account of transportation

services also declined to US dollars 1,710 million

in 2019, from US dollars 1,737 million in 2018.

Consequently, net inflows from the transport sector

declined to US dollars 630 million during 2019, from

US dollars 750 million in 2018. Earnings from air

passenger fares declined to US dollars 1,056 million

in 2019 from US dollars 1,227 million in 2018, with

the decline in passenger arrivals to Sri Lanka in the

aftermath of the Easter Sunday attacks, which also

prompted SriLankan Airlines to reduce air fares and

issue discounted prices for several months from

April 2019. However, earnings from air passenger

fares improved during the latter part of the year

with a faster than expected recovery in tourist

arrivals parallel to the winter tourist season and the

normalisation of air fares. With some expansion in

port related activities, reflecting increased cargo,

container and transshipment volumes handled at

the port of Colombo, inflows on account of freight

charges with respect to sea transport services

increased marginally, while airport related freight

services also increased, resulting in a growth of

earnings from freight services by 1.9 per cent to

US dollars 1,283 million in 2019.

Travel and Tourism

The tourism industry, which was severely

affected by the Easter Sunday attacks,

recovered faster than expected by the end

of 2019, supported by swift action taken by

relevant authorities. Tourist arrivals, which

recorded the highest ever quarterly arrivals during

the first quarter of 2019, recorded an overall decline

of 18.0 per cent to 1,913,702 arrivals in 2019, in

comparison to 2,333,796 arrivals recorded in 2018.

A notable decline was observed in tourist arrivals

following the issuance of travel advisories by main

countries of tourist origins following the Easter

Sunday attacks. However, remedial measures

taken on the policy front, improvement in security

conditions, financial support for businesses in the

tourism sector, tourism promotion and softening of

travel advisories by mid-2019 helped revive tourist

arrivals at a faster than anticipated pace by the end

of the year. Accordingly, tourist arrivals gradually

recovered, recording only a 4.5 per cent decline on

a year-on-year basis in December 2019 from the

decline of 70.8 per cent in May.

Tourist arrivals from all major regions,

declined in 2019. Europe continued to be the

largest tourist origin for Sri Lanka with 887,572

arrivals, accounting for 46.4 per cent of total tourist

arrivals. However, tourist arrivals from Europe

declined by 12.8 per cent in 2019 in comparison

to 2018, driven by the decline of arrivals from

Western, Northern, Southern and Mediterranean

sub regions, despite the increase recorded in

arrivals from Central and Eastern Europe, with an

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

impressive growth of arrivals from Russia. The Asia

Pacific region recorded the second highest arrivals

in 2019 with 839,470 tourists, accounting for 43.9

per cent of total tourist arrivals, despite the overall

decline of 23.1 per cent. This decline of tourists

from the Asia Pacific region made the largest

contribution to the decline in total arrivals in 2019. In

terms of tourist arrivals by countries, India remained

the leading country of origin with 355,002 arrivals,

followed by the UK, China, Germany and Australia.

The top five inbound tourist origins collectively

accounted for around 50 per cent of total arrivals

in 2019. Among the top ten inbound tourist origins,

only arrivals from Russia registered a growth,

amounting to 34.2 per cent mainly due to arrivals of

tourists by Charter Flights. In terms of the purpose

of visit, over 83 per cent of tourists visited the

country for leisure, while 3.7 per cent for business

purposes. Less than 2 per cent visited for meetings,

incentives, conferences, exhibitions (MICE) and

sporting events. Arrivals for various other purposes,

such as visiting friends and relatives, and religious,

health and education purposes accounted for 11.4

per cent of total arrivals.

A significant decline in tourist earnings

was recorded as a result of the reduced tourist

arrivals after the Easter Sunday attacks. As per

the annual survey on tourist spending conducted

by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority

(SLTDA), the average spending per tourist in 2019

rose to US dollars 181.23 per day from US dollars

173.80 per day in 2018. The SLTDA survey suggests

an increase in spending for accommodation as the

main reason for the increase in average spending

per tourist, despite some adverse impacts on

pricing after the Easter Sunday attacks. The

average duration of stay by a tourist was estimated

at 10.4 days in 2019, in comparison to 10.8 days

in 2018. Consequently, despite an increase in

average spending by tourists, due to the significant

decline in tourist arrivals and a marginal decline in

the average duration of stay period, earnings from

tourism declined by 17.7 per cent to US dollars

3,607 million in 2019, in comparison to US dollars

4,381 million in 2018. Meanwhile, outflows related

to travel were also estimated to have declined to

US dollars 1,638 million, recording a reduction

of 1.3 per cent in 2019, mainly due to reduced

travel abroad by Sri Lankans in the aftermath of

the Easter Sunday attacks. Consequently, the net

inflows to the travel and tourism sub sector declined

significantly from US dollars 2,721 million in 2018

to US dollars 1,969 million in 2019.

Despite the setback in tourist arrivals in the

aftermath of the Easter Sunday attacks, the

tourism industry continued to attract notable

investments in 2019. The Investor Relations

Unit (IRU) of SLTDA (formerly known as the One

Stop Unit), granted approval for 59 hotel projects

in 2019, with a collective capacity of 2,237 rooms.

During 2019, new proposals worth US dollars 189

million for 132 hotels were referred to the IRU, and

upon completion of these projects, further 2,584

rooms will be added to the industry. Of these, 66

new proposals worth US dollars 81.6 million were

received during the second half of 2019, indicating

the continued interest of investors in the potential

of Sri Lanka’s tourism industry.

Several policy measures and numerous

promotional campaigns were implemented in

2019 to harness the potential of Sri Lanka’s

tourism industry with special activities being

carried out following the terrorist attacks

on Easter Sunday. Accordingly, an economic

relief package, including a debt moratorium was

introduced in May 2019. Initially this relief package

was valid till 31 March 2020, but it was subsequently

extended till 31 March 2021, covering both capital

and interest on loans taken by registered businesses

in the tourism industry. It is likely that with the

ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which will have a

devastating impact on tourism, such relief would be

expanded further. A separate relief package was

introduced by the Ministry of Finance, in May 2019,

focusing mainly on informal sector stakeholders of

the tourism sector. Schemes were also introduced

to grant working capital loans at concessionary

rates to registered businesses under the Enterprise

Sri Lanka initiative. Further, Value Added Tax

(VAT) on registered hotels and tour operators was

reduced to 7 per cent in June 2019 and eliminated

in December 2019. Measures were also taken

to improve the security situation in the country in

order to build confidence among tourists. Further,

import duty on security related products was also

removed. Special emphasis was placed on tourism

promotion after the Easter Sunday attacks, where

the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTPB)

took prompt action by organising press trips with

several international travel influencers, arranging

visits of Travel Associations and holding media

events in China and India to regain the tourism

image of Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, the SLTPB

continued its routine promotional activities in

identified markets. Accordingly, the SLTPB carried

out 59 travel and tourism fairs and 18 road shows,

giving opportunities to local travel organisations

to create direct business relationships. In

addition, outdoor advertising campaigns covering

On 21 April 2019, the day of the Easter Sunday celebrations, three churches located in Negombo, Batticaloa and Colombo and three luxury hotels in Colombo were attacked in a series of coordinated suicide bombings planned by a local militant group that had declared allegiance to a foreign terrorist organisation. More than 250 civilians were killed due to this tragic event including foreign nationals, while more than 500 were estimated to have been injured.

Following the Easter Sunday attacks, the government declared a state of emergency and imposed nightly police curfew for several days. All schools and state universities of the country were closed for two weeks following the incident. The government blocked major social media platforms to prevent the spread of misinformation that could lead to violence among communities. The operations of the Colombo Stock Exchange were also temporarily suspended on 22 April 2019. It took about two weeks after the incident for civilian life and economic activities to show any sign of return to normalcy. Meanwhile, the Central Bank also adopted an accommodative monetary policy stance commencing May 2019, amidst subpar economic growth that was further affected by the Easter Sunday attacks, decelerating private sector credit, muted inflation expectations and inflation outlook.

The series of attacks particularly affected the tourism industry tremendously, while causing negative spillover effects on several other sectors such as air transportation services, domestic transportation, wholesale and retail trade and accommodation, food and beverage service activities, leisure and entertainment, manufacturing of food and beverages and agriculture. The exchange rate also experienced some pressure in the immediate aftermath of the attacks, with withdrawals of foreign investment from the government securities market. The Colombo Stock Exchange also experienced a setback with a fall in price indices and market capitalisation. However, the exact economic impact of the terrorist attacks cannot be quantified, as other major events, such as global economic and financial market developments, adverse weather conditions that prevailed throughout the second half of 2019 and the uncertainty that prevailed until the conclusion of the presidential election in the latter part of the year, also impacted the economic slowdown in the aftermath of the Easter Sunday attacks. Nevertheless, it can be concluded that the attacks impacted the already sluggish economic growth, and largely contributed to the slow growth of 2.3 per cent in 2019.

The fiscal performance deteriorated in 2019, with the poor revenue collection as a result of deceleration in overall economic activity, partly due to the Easter Sunday attacks. In addition, government expenditure is also estimated to have been increased with the implementation of relief packages facilitating the recovery of the affected parties, strengthened security measures, provision of interest subsidies and reconstruction of affected

BOX 9The Impact of the Easter Sunday Attacks

public infrastructure. However, even after the Easter Sunday attacks, the government of Sri Lanka issued an International Sovereign Bond to the value of US dollars 2 billion in June 2019 and the oversubscription reflected the international investor community’s continued support for Sri Lanka and their confidence in the country’s long term growth prospects.

According to the estimates of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), direct and indirect employment in the tourism sector is 4.6 per cent of the total labour force in Sri Lanka. Moreover, tourism earnings as a share of the country’s GDP is approximately 4-5 per cent. Following the terrorist attacks, 37 countries, including top most inbound tourist origins of Sri Lanka, issued travel advisories at various levels of risks, though most of which were lifted in subsequent months with the improvement of the security conditions of the country. According to an analysis by ForwardKeys, which forecasts future travel patterns by analysing over 17 million flight booking transactions a day, in the three days immediately after the attacks, cancellations of existing flight bookings surged by 86.2 per cent whilst new bookings declined sharply. Tourist arrivals per day, which averaged around 7,600 during 2019 prior to the attacks, dropped significantly to around 1,700 during the two month period after the attacks. However, Sri Lanka’s tourism industry witnessed a speedy recovery during the second half of the year with average arrivals per day increasing to around 6,900 during the last two months of the year. Nevertheless, on a cumulative basis, tourist arrivals declined by 18.0 per cent (year-on-year) to 1,913,702 which led earnings from tourism to decline by 17.7 per cent to US dollars 3,607 million in 2019.

Some of the major tourist destinations around the world have experienced similar terror attacks in recent years. Recent examples are the Paris attacks in November 2015 and the Brussels bombings in March 2016. However, these countries have recovered eventually with timely implementation of appropriate measures. Tourism in Metropolitan France has strongly rebounded since October 2016,1 less than a year after the terrorist attacks, while the Brussels region also showed signs of recovery since October 2016,2 seven months after the terrorist attacks. According to the estimates of the World Travel and Tourism Council, the time taken for destinations to recover from the impact of terrorist attacks is around 13 months, whereas it would take around 27 months to recover from political turmoil. Average recovery times after a pandemic and an environmental disaster are much longer than that of a terrorist attack which are estimated at 21 months and 24 months, respectively.

Figure B 9.1 depicts the path of recovery in tourist arrivals after the Easter Sunday attacks, in response to the measures taken to revive the industry. Tourist arrivals experienced a drastic drop of 71 per cent (year-on-year) in May 2019. However, tourist arrivals picked up gradually in the following 3 months and demonstrated a dip in September before increasing sharply towards the end of the year, by the beginning of the tourist season. Accordingly, arrivals in the month of November recorded only a decline of 9.5 per cent while this decline further lowered to 4.5 per cent in December. These statistics indicate that Sri Lanka’s tourism sector almost completely recovered within 7 months after the terrorist attacks, which is less than the average time of 13 months as estimated by the World Travel and Tourism Council. However, the negative impact of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic on global and domestic tourism will be reflected in the number of tourist arrivals in 2020.

The government of Sri Lanka took several measures to rebuild the tourism industry after the Easter Sunday attacks. Special emphasis was placed on tourism promotion, financial and fiscal support to sectors directly linked to the tourism sector. Accordingly, an economic relief package, including a debt moratorium, was introduced in May 2019, on both capital and interest payments related to credit facilities obtained by registered businesses in the tourism industry. This moratorium which was to be valid until end March 2020 has been extended due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the debt moratorium, a separate relief package was introduced by the government, in May 2019, focusing mainly on informal sector stakeholders of the tourism sector. Moreover, licensed commercial banks were also permitted to use the funds in Jaya Isura loan scheme under the government’s Enterprise Sri Lanka programme and the Saubagya loan scheme of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to grant working capital facilities to those who are engaged in the tourism industry. Further, Value Added Tax (VAT) on registered hotels and tour operators was reduced to 7 per cent from 15 per cent for the period of 01 June 2019 to 30 November 2019 while

import duty was removed on security related products. With effect from 01 December 2019, a VAT rate of zero per cent will be charged on supply of services by hotels and similar businesses providing similar services which are registered under the SLTDA, if 60 per cent of the total value of inputs are sourced from local suppliers whereas other businesses will be charged at a rate of 8 per cent. In order to rebuild the brand image of Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTPB) carried out targeted promotional campaigns, which included organising press trips with several international travel influencers, arranging visits of Travel Associations and holding press conferences in China and India. The SLTPB also launched 15 special promotional packages for reservations made through the travel agent network in India. Routine promotional activities in identified markets were conducted by way of travel and tourism fairs and road shows while also carrying out outdoor advertising campaigns in subway stations abroad. These efforts were complemented by a digital advertising campaign and a television campaign in collaboration with CNN. The subsequent improvement in the security conditions of the country and continued promotional activities, by both private sector and government stakeholders of the tourism industry, contributed to the faster recovery of the tourism sector.

The country’s ability to regain the momentum of economic activity after a terror attack or any other crisis situation at a faster pace depends on the availability of robust contingency plans, disaster recovery programmes and risk management protocols. Therefore, being proactive, rather than reactive, is a critical factor in an event of a crisis. In this aspect, aligning law and order authorities, civil society, tourism authorities and the media to face such crises is essential for the success in improving business and tourism resilience. Sri Lanka has, from time to time, proven its ability to withstand many tragic events, including a 30-year armed conflict, devastation by a Tsunami and the Easter Sunday attacks. Despite the gradual recovery, many global vulnerabilities, the latest being the COVID-19 pandemic are bound to impact the country’s tourism sector and other economic activities. Therefore, emergency preparedness from all perspectives, including macroeconomic policy, is vital in improving the country’s resilience to handle such unforeseen events, thereby minimising their adverse economic and social impact.

subway stations and well-known overseas tourist

attractions were carried out with a six-month digital

advertising campaign during 2019. A three-month

television campaign was conducted with CNN

and a print advertising campaign was carried

out in key tourist source markets. The SLTPB

visiting bloggers programme continued in 2019

with 57 bloggers and social media influencers,

while 62 journalists were hosted under the visiting

journalist programme. Meanwhile, around 99,000

passengers from 53 cruise ships arrived at the

Colombo Port during 2019. Further, the second leg

of several internationally popular adventure sports

events, such as Ironman 70.3 and Raid Amazons

were held in 2019, promoting Sri Lanka as a

diverse adventure tourist destination in the region.

In addition, it was also proposed to carry out a five-

year global communication campaign covering key

source markets of Sri Lanka, with an objective of

achieving a revenue target of US dollars 10 billion

by the year 2025.

Following the Easter Sunday attacks that

caused a major blow to the country’s tourism

sector, it became apparent that a coherent

recovery plan in close consultation with all

stakeholders of the tourism industry was

required for the sector to rebound. However, as

a country that withstood more than three decades

of terrorism until 2009, Sri Lanka possesses

experience in managing the consequences of

unexpected events. Thus, further strategies

for security enhancements, restoring investor

confidence, attracting tourists from niche markets,

better pricing of accommodation and training on

service standards are required. Sri Lanka should

adopt robust contingency plans, disaster recovery

programmes and risk management protocols in

order to restore tourists’ confidence in the safety

and normalcy of their destination. Tourism sector

development authorities and all stakeholders

need to work together with the media with special

reference to various social media platforms as a

means to change the perception of the tourists

by creating impactful media campaigns to attract

and retain tourists. Moreover, it is essential to

introduce smart technology based solutions to

uplift the tourism sector considering the entire

life cycle of a tourist starting from their arrival

up to their departure from the country. These

smart solutions can be introduced in the form of

focused messaging while arriving in the country,

automation of visa granting process and border

control, enabling free connectivity at popular

tourist attractions across the country, developing

new travel specific information applications to be

used at historical sites and museums and finally

encouraging tourists to share their experiences.

The tourism sector could suffer a further setback

during the period ahead, following the outbreak

of COVID-19 that originated in China. Preventive

measures were taken by relevant authorities,

including suspending passenger arrivals from all

countries at the Bandaranaike International Airport

and all other international airports for the operation

of inward international commercial passengers

from March 2020 to ensure that the spread of this

disease is curtailed so that the residents as well as

the tourists are free from its impact.

Telecommunications, Computer and Information Services

Earnings from telecommunication, computer

and information services continued to expand

in 2019. Total earnings from the export of the

telecommunication, computer and information

services grew by 5.9 per cent to US dollars 1,054

million in 2019. Earnings from telecommunications

services sub sector increased during the year to

US dollars 155 million in 2019 from US dollars 147

million in 2018. This growth mainly originated from

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

increased usage of internet based communication

facilities, supported by broadband data services.

The government also took measures to reduce

the Telecommunication Levy (TL) imposed from

December 2019, which is expected to further

stimulate growth in the telecommunications

sector. It is expected that the data driven growth

of the telecommunications sector would grow at a

significant pace and the 4G smartphone penetration

would improve significantly. The major players of

the telecommunications industry are also looking

at possibilities of launching a 5G network, further

developing the telecommunications infrastructure,

which is expected to facilitate data transfer speeds

ten times higher than those afforded by 4G LTE

networks.

The computer and information services

sub sector continued its growth momentum

in 2019. Accordingly, inflows to computer and

information services increased from US dollars

848 million in 2018 to US dollars 899 million in

2019. Continued expansion of Business Process

Outsourcing (BPO) and Knowledge Process

Outsourcing (KPO) contributed to the growth in

this sector. Sri Lanka was awarded the Delivery

Destination Award for 2019 by the Global Sourcing

Association (GSA) of the United Kingdom, the

industry association and professional body for

the global sourcing industry. The Sri Lanka

Association of Software and Services Companies

(SLASSCOM), as the national chamber for the

information technology (IT) based knowledge

and information industry in Sri Lanka, continued

its efforts in business facilitation, education, and

employment enhancement as well as research and

innovation in the sector by organising a number of

events relating to the sector, while promoting key

areas of growth and innovation with stakeholder

collaboration.

5.4.2 Primary Income

The deficit in the primary income account

widened marginally in 2019. The deficit in the

primary income account increased to US dollars

2,426 million in 2019 compared to US dollars

2,385 million in 2018, with higher repatriation of

dividends and reinvested earnings by foreign direct

investment enterprises (DIEs). Dividend payments

increased in 2019 compared to the previous year

with profitable DIEs opting for higher dividend

payments. Reinvested earnings also increased in

2019 with the realisation of comparatively higher

profits reported by some large DIEs, particularly

publicly listed companies. A modest increase

was observed in interest payments on portfolio

investment, mainly due to the increase in coupon

payments on outstanding stock of ISBs, while

coupon payments of Treasury bonds reduced

notably with the significant reduction in outstanding

foreign investment in Treasury bonds during the

year. There was a notable reduction in coupon

payments by deposit taking corporations with the

maturity of all outstanding international bonds

issued by deposit taking corporations by end 2019.

Interest payments on government foreign loans,

which are recorded under interest payments of

other investments in the primary income account,

recorded a marginal increase, while interest

payments on foreign loans by deposit taking

corporations declined marginally during the year.

Meanwhile, inflows to the primary income account

amounted to US dollars 252 million in 2019

compared to US dollars 249 million recorded in

2018, mainly on account of the increase in interest

income by deposit taking corporations.

5.4.3 Secondary Income

Workers’ remittances continued to

moderate in 2019. Workers’ remittances, which

account for the majority of inflows in the secondary

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

5

income account, declined by 4.3 per cent to US

dollars 6,717 million in 2019, after declining by

2.1 per cent in 2018. Workers' remittances were

impacted by the geopolitical developments in the

Middle Eastern economies, where most workers’

remittances originate from, amid volatility in

international petroleum prices. Further, as per the

Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment, overall

labour migration for foreign employment continued

its declining trend in 2019 as well. The decline in

departures for foreign employment may also be

attributed largely to improved opportunities in the

domestic labour market and the continuation of

government measures to discourage migration

of female unskilled labour. Consequently, inflows

to the secondary income account declined to US

dollars 6,726 million in 2019 compared to US

dollars 7,023 million in 2018. Meanwhile, personal

transfers abroad and related payments by non-

residents living in Sri Lanka increased in 2019. With

these developments, net inflows to the secondary

income account declined to US dollars 5,766 million

in 2019 in comparison to a net inflow of US dollars

6,163 million recorded in 2018.

5.5 Current Account Balance

The external current account deficit

narrowed significantly in 2019, responding

to policy measures taken in 2018. The current

account deficit declined mainly as a result of the

significant contraction of the trade deficit, despite

the marginal widening of the primary income

account deficit and the moderation of surpluses

in the services and secondary income accounts.

The trade deficit contracted significantly, driven

by a sharp contraction in merchandise import

expenditure, while merchandise exports recorded

a marginal growth during the year. The surplus in

the services account moderated primarily due to

the reduction in tourist earnings, resulting from the

impact of the Easter Sunday attacks. The deficit

in the primary income account widened marginally

during the year with increased dividends

payments and reinvested earnings of DIEs.

Workers’ remittances contracted during the year,

moderating the surplus in the secondary income

account. Consequently, the current account deficit

narrowed to US dollars 1,808 million in 2019 in

comparison to US dollars 2,799 million in 2018,

and the current account deficit as a percentage

of GDP improved to 2.2 per cent in 2019 in

comparison to 3.2 per cent in 2018.

5.6 Capital Account Balance

Inflows to the capital account increased,

albeit marginally, in 2019. On a net basis,

inflows to the capital account recorded a marginal

increase amounting to US dollars 23 million in 2019

compared to US dollars 14 million in 2018, due to

the increase in receipts of capital transfers to the

government and the private sector.

5.7 Financial Account

Significant inflows to the financial account

resulted in both net incurrence of liabilities

and net acquisition of assets increasing in

2019 compared to 2018. Higher net inflows to

the financial account, driven by increased foreign

borrowings by the government compared to debt

repayments, resulted in an increase in net incurrence

of liabilities in 2019. Accordingly, net incurrence

of liabilities amounted to US dollars 2,947 million

in 2019 compared to US dollars 2,816 million in

2018. Net acquisition of assets also increased

by US dollars 514 million in 2019 compared to a

net decline of assets in 2018, mainly due to the

increase in gross official reserves. The proceeds

from the two ISBs issued by the government in

March and June 2019, amounting to US dollars

4.4 billion, and the receipt of the sixth and seventh

tranches of the IMF-EFF were the major inflows

to the financial account in 2019. The year was

characterised by a significant moderation of

inflows to equity markets in the form of FDIs and

outflows of foreign investments from the CSE,

particularly driven by weak investor sentiment in

the aftermath of the Easter Sunday attacks and

the uncertainty leading up to the presidential

election in the latter part of 2019. There were also

intermittent outflows of foreign investment from

the rupee denominated government securities

market, with large net outflows from April to August

and in December 2019. Despite these volatilities,

moderate net inflows were observed in some

periods in the domestic foreign exchange market,

which enabled the Central Bank to purchase

foreign exchange on a net basis. The government

met sizeable debt repayment obligations in

2019, repaying two maturing ISBs amounting to

US dollars 1.5 billion as well as the repayment

of foreign currency term financing facilities and

maturing SLDBs. Financial flows to the banking

sector, private sector and state owned business

enterprises (SOBEs) moderated, with net outflows

as a result of higher debt servicing. Deposit

taking corporations also completed repayment of

a previously issued international bond in 2019.

With these developments, gross official reserves

increased to US dollars 7.6 billion by end 2019

from US dollars 6.9 billion at end 2018, while the

overall balance in the BOP recorded a surplus of

US dollars 377 million at end 2019.

5.7.1 Direct Investment

FDI inflows, which include foreign borrowings

of companies registered with the Board of

Investment (BOI), declined significantly in 2019.

Total FDI inflows, including foreign loans received

by BOI companies, amounted to US dollars 1,204

million in 2019. FDI inflows in 2019 were less than

the inflows of US dollars 2,139 million in 2018 (US

dollars 1,457 million excluding the Hambantota

port proceeds received by the government) and US

dollars 1,910 million in 2017. The moderation in FDI

inflows could be primarily attributed to the weakened

investor sentiments with increased uncertainties in

the aftermath of the Easter Sunday attacks and

political developments. FDI inflows, excluding

foreign loans to BOI companies, which amounted

to US dollars 758 million, comprised US dollars

374 million of net intercompany debt, US dollars

264 million of reinvested earnings and US dollars

120 million of net investments in equity during the

year 2019. In comparison, FDI, excluding foreign

loans obtained by BOI companies, amounted to US

dollars 1,614 million in 2018. A notable reduction

in equity and intercompany borrowings was

recorded in 2019 compared to the previous year.

However, there was a healthy level of reinvested

earnings from a few large publicly listed FDI

companies. On a sectoral basis, major FDIs were

received by projects related to port infrastructure,

property development and hotels and to the

telecommunications sector. Based on the origin of

the immediate investor, India, Singapore, Canada,

Hong Kong and China were the top five source

countries of FDI in 2019. Despite some moderation

in FDI inflows in the near term, it is expected that

the Hambantota industrial zone, the Colombo Port

City, the hotel sector and mixed development

sector will attract significant inflows in the coming

years. The telecommunications sector is also

expected to receive notable FDI flows, primarily

targeting the development of the Information and

Communication Technology (ICT) sector in Sri

Lanka. It is also expected that the implementation

of the Strategic Project Development Act (SPDA)

as well as the recent revisions to the tax structure

will also provide impetus to attract FDIs. However,

persistent issues such as relatively low ranking

in the Doing Business Index, high wage rates

and utility costs compared to regional peers, high

costs of land acquisition, rigidity in labour laws

and government procedures remain the main

impediments in terms of attracting FDIs to the

country.

5.7.2 Portfolio Investment

Equity

Foreign investments in equity, which

reflect foreign equity investments in the CSE,

excluding direct investment, recorded a net

outflow in 2019. Portfolio investments in equity

consist of foreign residents’ investments in CSE

other than direct investment transactions, and

account for investments by non- residents holding

less than 10 per cent of the total shareholding of a

Sri Lankan enterprise. Portfolio investment in the

form of equity recorded a net outflow of US dollars

15 million in 2019. This comprised a net outflow of

US dollars 45 million from the secondary market

and an inflow of US dollars 30 million to the primary

market.

Debt Securities

Financial flows in the form of debt securities

increased significantly in 2019 with the

issuance of two new ISBs by the government.

Sri Lanka’s thirteenth and fourteenth US dollar

benchmark offerings in the international bond

markets were successfully made in March and

June 2019, respectively. Two ISBs with 5 year

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

193

5

and 10 year maturities to the value of US dollars

2.4 billion were issued in March 2019, while two

ISBs with 5 year and 10 year maturities valued

at US dollars 2 billion were issued in June 2019.

An overwhelming interest from a wide range

of investors was observed at these auctions,

reflecting global investors’ continued confidence

in Sri Lanka’s macroeconomic outlook. The

government also settled two ISBs, amounting to

US dollars 1 billion which matured in January 2019

and US dollars 500 million which matured in April

2019. There were sizeable foreign outflows from

the Treasury bond market in 2019, recording a net

outflow of US dollars 388 million during the year.

Meanwhile, there was a net inflow of US dollars

55 million of foreign investments to the Treasury

bill market in 2019. Deposit taking corporations

also repaid the last part of an international bond

issuance amounting to US dollars 250 million

during the year.

5.7.3 Other Investment

Currency and Deposits

In relation to deposit taking corporations,

currency and deposits in the form of assets

decreased, while currency and deposit liabilities

increased in 2019. Accordingly, currency and

deposits in the form of assets of deposit taking

corporations decreased by US dollars 93 million,

while currency and deposit liabilities increased

by US dollars 167 million in 2019. The relatively

moderate net transactions during the year are also

reflective of the stability in the domestic foreign

exchange market to some extent.

Loans

Net loan inflows to the financial account

declined in 2019. The reduction in net loan inflows

was mainly due to net loan repayments by deposit

taking corporations, the government, SOBEs and

private corporations, while net loan inflows to the

Central Bank increased during 2019. Accordingly,

foreign loans to the financial account recorded a net

outflow of US dollars 277 million, in sharp contrast

to a net inflow of US dollars 1,620 million in 2018.

Net inflows to the government, in the

form of foreign loans, recorded a decline in

2019. Accordingly, the foreign loan flows to the

government recorded a net outflow of US dollars

97 million in 2019 compared to a net inflow of US

dollars 557 million in 2018. This net outflow was

a result of foreign loan repayments of US dollars

1,662 million and foreign loan inflows of US

dollars 1,565 million during the year. Major project

loan inflows to the government included loans

obtained for the Construction of Outer Circular

Highway Project Phase III from Kerawalapitiya to

Kadawatha, Construction of Extension of Southern

Expressway Section 1 from Matara to Beliatta and

Construction of Extension of Southern Expressway

Section 2 from Beliatta to Wetiya Project. There

was no inflow in the form of a foreign currency term

financing facility in 2019, while the government

repaid US dollars 473 million of foreign currency

term financing facility obligations in 2019 compared

to US dollars 613 million in 2018.

Foreign loans obtained by deposit taking

corporations, private corporations and SOBEs

recorded a net repayment, while loan inflows

to the Central Bank increased in 2019. Net

foreign loan inflows to deposit taking corporations,

which consist of licensed commercial banks

(LCBs), licensed specialised banks (LSBs) and

licensed finance companies (LFCs), recorded a

net repayment of US dollars 281 million in 2019

compared to a net inflow of US dollars 697 million

in 2018. Further, private corporations and SOBEs,

classified under the other sectors in the financial

account of the BOP, recorded a net repayment of

foreign loans amounting to US dollars 226 million

in 2019. Total foreign loan inflows to private

corporations and SOBEs amounted to US dollars

450 million, with all loan inflows being received

by the private sector during the year. Of foreign

loan repayments of US dollars 676 million, private

corporations’ repayments amounted to US dollars

465 million during 2019. Meanwhile, foreign loans to

the Central Bank recorded a net inflow of US dollars

327 million with the receipt of the sixth and seventh

tranches under the IMF-EFF during the year.

Trade Credit and Advances and Other Accounts Receivable / Payable

Trade credit and advances received by

residents as well as trade credit and advances

given to non-residents decreased in 2019.

The net incurrence of liabilities of trade credit

and advances declined by US dollars 28 million

in 2019, compared to an increase of US dollars

247 million in 2018. Meanwhile, the net acquisition

of assets on trade credit and advances, which

represents trade credit and advances given by

Sri Lankan exporters to their overseas trading

partners and deposit taking corporations, reduced

by US dollars 4 million in 2019, compared to an

increase of US dollars 177 million in 2018. Further,

other accounts payable, mainly consisting of Asian

Clearing Union (ACU) liabilities managed by the

Central Bank, recorded a marginal increase of US

dollars 24 million, while other accounts receivable

of LCBs recorded a net increase of US dollars 196

million during the year.

5.7.4 Reserve Assets

Transactions related to reserve assets

recorded an increase in 2019. Transactions of

reserve assets increased by US dollars 337 million

in 2019, on a net basis, compared to the decline of

US dollars 1,002 million recorded in 2018. During

the year, currency and deposits of the Central

Bank increased by US dollars 361 million, while the

Central Bank’s investment in foreign debt securities

declined by US dollars 19 million. Further, the

Central Bank reduced its monetary gold holdings

by net sales of US dollars 14 million during 2019.

5.8 Overall Balance

The overall balance, which is equal to the

change in net international reserves, recorded

a surplus in 2019 in contrast to the deficit

recorded in 2018. Significant inflows to the financial

account during the year in terms of proceeds of the

ISBs resulted in an increase in net international

reserves, amounting to US dollars 5,871 million

at end 2019, from US dollars 5,495 million at end

2018. Consequently, the overall balance recorded

a surplus of US dollars 377 million in 2019, in

comparison to the deficit of US dollars 1,103 million

recorded in 2018.

5.9 International Investment

Position

In terms of the International Investment

Position (IIP), Sri Lanka’s external liability

position as well as the asset position increased

at end 2019 from end 2018. The IIP records the

value and composition of the country’s stock position

in external assets and liabilities with the rest of the

world. The stock position of external assets increased

to US dollars 12,985 million at end 2019 from US

dollars 12,098 million at end 2018, primarily due to

the increase in gross official reserves. Gross official

reserves stood at US dollars 7.6 billion at end 2019

in comparison to US dollars 6.9 billion at end 2018.

Asset position in direct investments, which reflects

the cumulative FDIs made by Sri Lankan companies

abroad, also increased during the year. There was an

increase in other accounts receivable of deposit taking

corporations, while a modest decline was recorded

in terms of trade credit and advances and currency

and deposit assets of deposit taking corporations. Sri

Lanka’s total foreign liability position also increased

significantly by around US dollars 3,862 million by

end 2019 to US dollars 65,252 million, compared to

US dollars 61,390 million at end 2018. This increase

can be mainly attributed to the increase in outstanding

foreign liabilities of the government due to the net

increase in outstanding liabilities of ISBs, increase in

outstanding liability position of the Central Bank and

an increase in outstanding currency and deposits

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

liability position of deposit taking corporations.

However, there was a decline in the outstanding

liability position of foreign loans by the government,

deposit taking corporations, private corporations and

SOBEs. Accordingly, Sri Lanka's net international

investment position, which is the difference between

Sri Lanka’s total asset and liability positions with non-

residents, recorded a higher net liability position of US

dollars 52,266 million at end 2019, compared to US

dollars 49,292 million at end 2018.

5.9.1 Direct Investment Position

The direct investment asset position and

the liability position increased in 2019. The

direct investment liability position increased to

US dollars 13,058 million at end 2019, compared

to US dollars 12,575 million at end 2018, with the

direct investment inflows recorded during the year.

Despite a net positive FDI flow, most FDI companies

listed in the CSE recorded notable valuation losses,

as a result of significantly low market prices during

the year. However, some publicly listed companies

and private BOI companies recorded a significant

increase in reinvested earnings, resulting in a

moderation of the impact of market price valuation

losses. Based on immediate country of investment,

China, India, Netherlands, Singapore and Malaysia

were the top five countries with the highest direct

investment liability stock positions at end 2019.

Meanwhile, direct investment abroad by Sri Lankan

residents recorded an outstanding asset position of

US dollars 1,497 million by end 2019, an increase

of 4.5 per cent from the previous year.

5.9.2 Portfolio Investment Position

The portfolio investment liability position

in the IIP increased significantly by end 2019.

The portfolio investment liability position increased

substantially to US dollars 16,998 million at end

2019 compared to US dollars 13,617 million at end

2018. Despite the maturity of two ISBs, the maturity

of an international bond issued by deposit taking

corporations and outflows of foreign investments

from the Treasury bond market, the outstanding

debt securities liability position increased as a

result of two issuances of ISBs amounting to US

dollars 4.4 billion during the year. The outstanding

position of Treasury bills and Treasury bonds held

by non residents stood at US dollars 525 million at

end 2019. The portfolio investment equity position,

which accounts for the outstanding equity liability

investments by foreign investors in CSE companies

that are not direct investments, increased to US

dollars 1,056 million by end 2019 from US dollars

812 million at end 2018, mainly with a resurgence

in market prices of some companies in the CSE

towards end 2019, after the presidential election.

Meanwhile, the outstanding debt security liability

position of deposit taking corporations was settled

in full during the year with the maturity of the

remaining international bond amounting to US

dollars 250 million issued by the National Savings

Bank.

5.9.3 Other Investment Position

Currency and Deposits

The currency and deposits asset position

declined, while the liability position recorded an

increase by end 2019. The currency and deposit

liability position increased from US dollars 1,581

million at end 2018 to US dollars 1,748 million at

end 2019, mainly due to the increase in deposit

liabilities of non residents in the banking sector.

The currency and deposit asset position, which

entirely consists of currency and deposit assets of

deposit taking corporations, declined to US dollars

771 million at end 2019 from US dollars 864 million

at end 2018.

Loans

The foreign loan liability position recorded

a marginal decline by end 2019. Despite the

increase in foreign loan liability position of the

Central Bank, the total outstanding loan liabilities

declined due to the reduction in the foreign loan

liability position of the government, deposit taking

corporations, private sector corporations and

SOBEs. Accordingly, the foreign loan liability

position stood at US dollars 30,288 million at end

2019 compared to US dollars 30,450 million at end

2018. The foreign loan liability position of the Central

Bank increased with the receipt of two tranches of

the IMF-EFF facility in May and November 2019.

The outstanding loan liability position of the private

sector decreased marginally with a decline in

foreign loans to some major corporates and BOI

companies. The government’s foreign loan liability

position declined marginally with the moderation

of loan inflows amidst continued repayments of

foreign project loans and foreign currency term

financing facilities during the year. The decline in

the foreign loan liability position of deposit taking

corporations was a result of the reduction in long

term foreign loans. Further, the foreign loan liability

position of SOBEs also declined as a result of debt

repayments and the absence of new foreign loan

disbursements during 2019.

Trade Credit and Advances

Both liability and asset positions of trade

credit and advances declined at end 2019.

The outstanding trade credit and advances

liability position, which consists of trade credit

and advances of the private sector and SOBEs,

decreased from US dollars 2,184 million at end

2018 to US dollars 2,156 million at end 2019,

mainly due to the decrease in outstanding trade

credits of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC).

Meanwhile, the outstanding asset position of trade

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

credit and advances, which reflects the trade credit

and advances given by deposit taking corporations

and the private sector also decreased marginally

to US dollars 1,178 million at end 2019 from US

dollars 1,182 million at end 2018.

Other Accounts Receivable / Payable and Special Drawing Rights

The outstanding position of other accounts

receivable as well as other accounts payable

increased in 2019. The outstanding position

of other accounts receivable of deposit taking

corporations increased to US dollars 1,896 million

by end 2019 from US dollars 1,700 million at end

2018. Meanwhile, the outstanding position of other

accounts payable increased marginally to US

dollars 456 million at end 2019, with an increase in

ACU related liabilities of the Central Bank. Further,

the outstanding Special Drawing Rights (SDR)

liability position declined marginally to US dollars

547 million at end 2019, with the movements in the

exchange rate.

5.9.4 Reserve Asset Position

Supported by higher inflows to the financial

account, Sri Lanka’s gross official reserve

asset position increased by end 2019. Gross

official reserves increased to US dollars 7.6 billion

by end 2019 from US dollars 6.9 billion at end 2018.

Despite the repayment of two ISBs and other debt

servicing obligations, the receipt of the proceeds of

two new ISBs, the receipt of the two tranches of the

IMF - EFF and the purchase of foreign exchange

by the Central Bank from the domestic foreign

exchange market, primarily contributed to enhance

the gross official reserve position by end 2019. In

addition, foreign exchange swap arrangements

with domestic banks of US dollars 366 million were

retired during the year, improving the quality of

reserves. The foreign exchange swap position at

end 2019 amounted to US dollars 357 million. The

country's gross official reserves at end 2019 were

sufficient to finance 4.6 months of imports while

covering 56.1 per cent of the country's short term

debt and liabilities at end 2019, compared to 3.7

months of imports and 50 per cent short term debt

and liabilities at end 2018. Meanwhile, total foreign

assets, consisting of gross official reserves and

from US dollars 9.6 billion at end 2018 to US dollars

10.4 billion by end 2019. Total foreign assets were

sufficient to finance 6.3 months of imports.

5.10 External Debt and Debt Servicing

5.10.1 External Debt

Sri Lanka’s total external debt rose

in 2019 mainly with the increase in the

external debt of the general government.

Total external debt of the country increased by

US dollars 3.5 billion during the year to US dollars

55.9 billion by end 2019. The outstanding liability

position of ISBs, based on market value, amounted

to US dollars 15.2 billion at end 2019 compared

to US dollars 11.6 billion at end 2018. This was

a net result of the government raising US dollars

4.4 billion through the two issuances of ISBs, while

repaying two ISBs amounting to US dollars 1.5

billion during the year. However, the outstanding

Treasury bonds held by non residents declined

with net outflows of foreign investment from the

government securities market, although foreign

investment in Treasury bills recorded a marginal

increase during the year. Total outstanding foreign

loans of the government recorded a marginal

decline, due to higher repayments of historical

outstanding foreign loan liabilities compared to the

disbursements in 2019. Sri Lanka’s outstanding

external debt position continued to increase with the

rising outstanding external debt of the government,

presenting the most significant vulnerability in the

external sector.

The outstanding liability position of the

Central Bank increased while the outstanding

debt of deposit taking corporations, private

corporations and SOBEs declined in 2019.

increased with the receipt of the two IMF-EFF

tranches and with marginal increase in liabilities

with the ACU. The external liability position

of deposit taking corporations declined with

repayment of a maturing international bond by

the National Savings Bank as well as a decrease

in outstanding foreign loans by commercial

banks, despite an increase in currency and

deposit liabilities.The outstanding foreign loans

of the private sector and SOBEs declined with

repayments of existing foreign loans. Further,

intercompany borrowing of DIEs recorded an

increase during the year, with some major DIEs

receiving intercompany loans and shareholder

advances.

The total outstanding external debt of the

country as a percentage of GDP increased

further during the year. The total outstanding

external debt as a percentage of GDP stood at

66.6 per cent at end 2019, compared to 59.2 per

cent at end 2018, as a result of a notable increase

in outstanding external debt and slower growth

in nominal GDP during 2019. The outstanding

external debt position of the government, out of

the total external debt position, amounted to 63.3

per cent at end 2019, compared to 61.1 per cent

at end 2018. Despite the increase in Sri Lanka’s

external debt, both in nominal terms and as a

percentage of GDP, there was an improvement in

the debt maturity profile, with the long term maturity

increasing from 50.1 per cent of GDP at end 2018

to 56.8 per cent of GDP by end 2019.

5.10.2 Foreign Debt Service Payments

Foreign debt service payments, which

consist of capital repayments and interest

payments on Sri Lanka’s external debt, declined

marginally in 2019. Capital repayments decreased

marginally from US dollars 4,188 million in 2018 to

US dollars 4,119 million in 2019, of which the general

government accounted for US dollars 3,176 million.

The repayment of two ISBs of US dollars 1.5 billion

that matured during the year mainly contributed to

the increased debt amortisation by the government.

The government also repaid US dollars 1,189

million of foreign loans and US dollars 473 million

of obligations under foreign currency term financing

facilities. Further, deposit taking corporations repaid

an international bond of US dollars 250 million,

which matured during the year. Meanwhile, capital

repayments of foreign loans by the private sector and

SOBEs declined in 2019 compared to 2018. Interest

payments decreased, albeit marginally, during the

year, to US dollars 1,653 million from US dollars 1,678

million in 2018. There was an increase in interest

payments on coupon payments of ISBs, while there

was a modest increase in interest payments on

foreign loans by the government. However, interest

payments on foreign investments in government

Treasury bonds declined during the year, with the

decline in outstanding stock of Treasury bonds, as a

result of net outflows of foreign investments from the

Treasury bond market. Further, coupon payments

on international bonds issued by the government

increased with the increase in the outstanding

stock of ISBs. Since earnings from merchandise

exports and services were significantly less in 2019

compared to the previous year, total external debt

service payments as a percentage of the export of

merchandise goods and services increased to 29.7

per cent in 2019 from 28.9 per cent in 2018. Further,

with the government’s external debt representing

the major part of the country’s debt stock, the

government’s debt service payments accounted for

79 per cent of total debt service payments in 2019.

High foreign currency debt service

obligations, including ISB maturities and

capital repayments of foreign currency

term financing facilities falling due over the

medium term, remain a major challenge to the

sustainability of the country’s external debt.

Increased reliance on foreign borrowings to finance

persistently high budget deficits and large external

current account deficits has resulted in annually

increasing debt servicing, and thereby continuously

raising the need to mobilise external resources.

The cost of such borrowings has also increased,

with the majority of the government’s external

borrowings being facilitated through issuances of

ISBs. On the other hand, increasing foreign debt

service payments cause a net drain in the country’s

international reserves, which serve as a buffer

against external shocks, and the country’s ability

to manage large volatilities in the domestic foreign

exchange market. Therefore, policy initiatives to

maintain external debt at sustainable levels should

focus on ensuring the sustainability of the current

account deficit and the budget deficit in the long

run. Although resolving such chronic structural

issues may not be possible in the short term, timely

and consistent implementation of a medium term

policy framework to address these issues with the

support of all stakeholders has become an utmost

priority.

5.11 Exchange Rate Movements

The Sri Lanka rupee remained broadly

stable with a marginal appreciation against the

US dollar in 2019. After the sharp depreciation

observed in 2018, the currency exhibited a

correction in 2019, despite some intermittent

volatility as a result of global and domestic

developments. The exchange rate strengthened

during the first four months of 2019 supported

by a significant contraction in the trade deficit

and an increase in financial flows, resulting in an

appreciation of 4.6 per cent prior to the Easter

Sunday attacks. Favourable liquidity conditions in

the domestic foreign exchange market that prevailed

during this period also enabled the Central Bank to

absorb foreign exchange from the market, on a net

basis. However, the exchange rate experienced

some pressure in the immediate aftermath of the

Easter Sunday attacks and again in the latter part

of August 2019, reflecting the impact of heightened

uncertainties in global markets, which resulted in

some unwinding of foreign investment from the

government securities market. However, liquidity

conditions in the domestic foreign exchange market

improved subsequently, helping to stabilise the

exchange rate. Consequently, the rupee recorded

an appreciation of 0.6 per cent against the US

dollar by end 2019. Meanwhile, the Central Bank

absorbed US dollars 387.0 million on a net basis

during the year 2019 compared to a net supply of

US dollars 1,119.7 million in 2018. Reflecting cross

currency exchange rate movements, the Sri Lankan

rupee appreciated against the Indian rupee (2.6 per

cent) and the euro (2.6 per cent) and depreciated

against the pound sterling (2.8 per cent) and the

Japanese yen (1.0 per cent) by end 2019.

Other major currencies showed mixed

movements against the US dollar. Accordingly,

at the end of 2019, the Indian rupee (1.9 per cent)

and the euro (1.9 per cent) depreciated against

the US dollar whilst pound sterling (3.5 per cent)

and the Japanese yen (1.6 per cent) appreciated.

With the combined effect of the appreciation of

the rupee against most major currencies, the Sri

Lankan rupee also appreciated against the SDR by

0.9 per cent during the year.

With the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic,

the exchange rate experienced significant

volatility in the latter part of March 2020.

The exchange rate, which remained relatively

stable in 2020 up to the second week of March,

underwent a significant depreciation thereafter,

as experienced by other emerging markets and

developing economies. The global economic and

financial market uncertainties resulted in significant

outflows from the government securities market,

while also affecting earnings from tourism, export

proceeds and workers’ remittances. The exchange

rate pressure also exacerbated with speculative

market behaviour. Amidst these developments,

the government and the Central Bank introduced

urgent policy measures in March 2020 to mitigate

the pressure in the domestic foreign exchange

market, including the suspension of the importation

of selected motor vehicles and certain non essential

consumer goods for three months. It is expected

that the volatility in the exchange rate will subside

after the initial market response, but the exchange

rate movements in 2020 are likely to remain

susceptible to global developments related to the

further spread of the pandemic in the period ahead.

5.11.1 Nominal and Real Effective Exchange Rates

During 2019, both the 5-currency and

24-currency Nominal Effective Exchange Rate

(NEER) and Real Effective Exchange Rate

(REER) indices increased. The NEER indices

increased reflecting the nominal appreciation of the

Sri Lankan rupee against some major currencies

together with the movements in cross currency

exchange rates. Accordingly, 5-currency and

24-currency NEER indices increased by 1.48 per

cent and 1.09 per cent, respectively, during 2019.

Meanwhile, the REER indices, the indicators of Sri

Lanka's external competitiveness taking inflation

differentials against countries in the basket in

addition to the variation in nominal exchange rates

into consideration, increased by 2.22 per cent and

2.34 per cent, respectively, for the 5-currency and

24-currency REER indices. However, the REER

indices remained below the base year level,

supporting the country's trade competitiveness.

5.11.2 Developments in the Domestic Foreign Exchange Market

The volume of transactions in the domestic

foreign exchange market increased further in

2019. Accordingly, the total volume of transactions

in the domestic foreign exchange market increased

significantly during the year to US dollars 19,377

million from US dollars 17,402 million in 2018. The

volume of spot transactions increased to US dollars

11,643 million (60.1 per cent of total transactions)

in 2019 from US dollars 10,770 million in 2018.

Further, the total volume of forward transactions

increased to US dollars 7,734 million in 2019 from

US dollars 6,632 million in 2018. During 2019, the

intervention by the Central Bank in the domestic

foreign exchange market resulted in an absorption

of US dollars 387 million, on a net basis. This

included a supply of US dollars 207 million and

an absorption of US dollars 594 million. This was

in contrast to the Central Bank supply of foreign

exchange liquidity amounting to US dollars 1,677

million and absorption of US dollars 557 million

during 2018. The net absorption from the domestic

foreign exchange market in 2019 was primarily

due to the lower level of outflows from the market

with the significant contraction in imports. These

conditions enabled the Central Bank to absorb

foreign exchange on a net basis during 2019, in

spite of volatilities caused by the Easter Sunday

attacks and the unwinding of foreign investment

from the government securities market. Meanwhile,

the Central Bank continued to allow the exchange

rate to reflect market fundamentals and intervened

in the domestic foreign exchange market only to

prevent a sharp volatility of the Sri Lankan rupee.

However, the volatile market behaviour in the face

of the COVID-19 outbreak required intervention by

the Central Bank in the domestic foreign exchange

market in the latter part of March 2020.

5.12 External Sector Outlook

The outlook of the external sector in 2020

is likely to be largely dependent on the global

impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting

global economic and market developments.

The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to result in a

significant widening of the current account deficit

in 2020. The trade deficit is likely to widen with a

significant impact on the global demand for key Sri

Lankan exports, even though import expenditure

is expected to be lower due to the unprecedented

drop in global crude oil prices, the drop in export

oriented import demand, the likely moderation in

investment goods imports and the policy driven

curtailment of vehicle and non-essential imports.

The tourism industry is expected to be severely

impacted, with an expected unprecedented

slowdown in global travel and tourism. The overall

impact on the tourism industry depends on the

EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

restoration of normalcy in global travel prior to Sri

Lanka’s peak tourist season in the latter part of

2020. Air passenger transport services will also be

impacted with the reduction in global travel, while

freight transport services are also expected to

decline in line with supply chain breakdowns and

reduction in merchandise trade. However, outflows

in terms of travel and transport services are also

likely to moderate, providing some cushion to the

expected deterioration in the services account.

The COVID-19 pandemic also impacted some of

Sri Lanka’s key sources of workers’ remittances,

including Italy, South Korea and the Middle East.

This is likely to result in some deterioration of

workers’ remittances in 2020. Overall, the current

account is likely to worsen significantly in 2020, but

the extent of this deterioration will depend on the

duration of the pandemic and the policy measures

adopted by policymakers globally as well as in Sri

Lanka.

The financial account is also likely to be

impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

Equity inflows in the form of FDI and foreign

investments in the CSE are likely to be contracted

by the global behaviour of financial markets

and investor confidence. However, improving

conditions, particularly in China, are likely to result

in the restoration of inflows to the Colombo Port

City and the Hambantota industrial zone projects.

FDI inflows are likely to pick up gradually from the

second half of 2020, particularly with the expected

political stability after the general elections. Foreign

borrowings by the government are expected in the

second half of 2020 to meet the possible widening

of the fiscal deficit and to honour debt service

payments.

High foreign currency debt service payments

falling due in 2020 and over the medium term

will continue to be a major concern. Annual

external debt service payment commitments,

including maturing ISBs and capital repayments of

foreign currency term financing facilities, falling due

in 2020 and beyond amounts to around US dollars

5 billion, on average. In the near term, Sri Lanka

could face heightened refinancing risks given

global financial market uncertainties and appetite

for safe heaven assets. In this context, meeting

debt serving requirements for 2020 prudently

without resorting to a depletion of official reserves,

with the least possible refinancing cost remains a

major challenge. Further, maintaining a sustainable

current account deficit while attracting a higher

level of non-debt creating inflows in the form of FDI

over the medium term is of paramount importance

in order to keep foreign borrowings at manageable

levels and to maintain the country’s external debt at

sustainable levels.

"On  21  April  2019, 
the  day  of 
the  Easter  Sunday 
celebrations, 
three 
churches 
located 
in  Negombo, 
Batticaloa  and  Colombo  and 
three 
luxury  hotels 
in 
Colombo were attacked in a series of coordinated suicide 
More  than  250  civilians  were  killed  due  to  this  tragic 
event including foreign nationals, while more than 500 
were estimated to have been injured. 
Following  the  Easter  Sunday  attacks,  the  government 
declared a state of emergency and imposed nightly police 
curfew for several days. All schools and state universities 
of  the  country  were  closed  for  two  weeks  following  the 
incident.  The  government  blocked  major  social  media 
platforms  to  prevent  the  spread  of  misinformation  that 
could lead to violence among communities. The operations 
of  the  Colombo  Stock  Exchange  were  also  temporarily 
suspended  on  22  April  2019.  It  took  about  two  weeks 
after the incident for civilian life and economic activities 
to show any sign of return to normalcy. Meanwhile, the 
Central Bank also adopted an accommodative monetary 
policy  stance  commencing  May  2019,  amidst  subpar 
economic growth that was further affected by the Easter 
Sunday attacks, decelerating private sector credit, muted 
inflation expectations and inflation outlook.
The  series  of  attacks  particularly  affected  the  tourism 
industry  tremendously,  while  causing  negative  spillover 
effects on several other sectors such as air transportation 
services,  domestic  transportation,  wholesale  and  retail 
trade  and  accommodation,  food  and  beverage  service 
activities, 
leisure 
and 
entertainment,  manufacturing 
of  food  and  beverages  and  agriculture.  The  exchange 
rate  also  experienced  some  pressure  in  the  immediate 
aftermath  of 
the  attacks,  with  withdrawals  of 
investment  from  the  government  securities  market.  The 
Colombo Stock Exchange also experienced a setback with 
a fall in price indices and market capitalisation. However, 
the exact economic impact of the terrorist attacks cannot 
be  quantified,  as  other  major  events,  such  as  global 
economic  and  financial  market  developments,  adverse 
weather conditions that prevailed throughout the second 
half of 2019 and the uncertainty that prevailed until the 
conclusion of the presidential election in the latter part of 
the  year,  also  impacted  the  economic  slowdown  in  the 
can be concluded that the attacks impacted the already 
sluggish economic growth, and largely contributed to the 
slow growth of 2.3 per cent in 2019.
The  fiscal  performance  deteriorated  in  2019,  with  the 
poor  revenue  collection  as  a  result  of  deceleration  in 
overall economic activity, partly due to the Easter Sunday 
attacks. 
In  addition,  government  expenditure 
estimated to have been increased with the implementation 
of relief packages facilitating the recovery of the affected 
parties,

Note: Tourist arrivals during the period shaded (in grey) were affected by the outbreak of the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
Figure B 9.1 depicts the path of recovery in tourist arrivals 
after the Easter Sunday attacks, in response to the measures 
taken to revive the industry. Tourist arrivals experienced a 
drastic drop of 71 per cent (year-on-year) in May 2019. 
However, 
tourist  arrivals  picked  up  gradually 
following 3 months and demonstrated a dip in September 
before increasing sharply towards the end of the year, by 
the beginning of the tourist season. Accordingly, arrivals 
in  the  month  of  November  recorded  only  a  decline  of  
9.5  per  cent  while 
this  decline 
further 
4.5 per cent in December. These statistics indicate that 
Sri  Lanka’s  tourism  sector  almost  completely  recovered 
within  7  months  after  the  terrorist  attacks,  which  is  less 
than the average time of 13 months as estimated by the 
World Travel and Tourism Council. However, the negative 
impact  of 
the  outbreak  of 
the  COVID-19  pandemic 
on global and domestic tourism will be reflected in the 
number of tourist arrivals in 2020.
The  government  of  Sri  Lanka  took  several  measures  to 
rebuild the tourism industry after the Easter Sunday attacks. 
Special  emphasis  was  placed  on 
tourism  promotion, 
financial and fiscal support to sectors directly linked to the 
tourism sector. Accordingly, an economic relief package, 
including  a  debt  moratorium,  was  introduced  in  May 
2019,  on  both  capital  and  interest  payments  related 
to  credit  facilities  obtained  by  registered  businesses  in 
the  tourism  industry.  This  moratorium  which  was  to  be 
valid  until  end  March  2020  has  been  extended  due  to 
the  outbreak  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  In  addition 
to  the  debt  moratorium,  a  separate  relief  package  was 
introduced  by  the  government,  in  May  2019,  focusing 
mainly  on  informal  sector  stakeholders  of  the  tourism 
sector. Moreover, licensed commercial banks were also 
permitted  to  use  the  funds  in  Jaya  Isura  loan  scheme 
under the government’s Enterprise Sri Lanka programme 
and  the  Saubagya  loan  scheme  of  the  Central  Bank 
of  Sri  Lanka  to  grant  working  capital  facilities  to  those 
who are engaged in the tourism industry. Further, Value 
Added Tax (VAT) on registered hotels and tour operators 
was  reduced  to  7  per  cent  from  15  per  cent  for  the 
period  of  01  June  2019  to  30  November  2019  while","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
