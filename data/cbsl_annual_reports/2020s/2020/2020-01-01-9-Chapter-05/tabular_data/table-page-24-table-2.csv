"On  21  April  2019, 
the  day  of 
the  Easter  Sunday 
celebrations, 
three 
churches 
located 
in  Negombo, 
Batticaloa  and  Colombo  and 
three 
luxury  hotels 
in 
Colombo were attacked in a series of coordinated suicide 
More  than  250  civilians  were  killed  due  to  this  tragic 
event including foreign nationals, while more than 500 
were estimated to have been injured. 
Following  the  Easter  Sunday  attacks,  the  government 
declared a state of emergency and imposed nightly police 
curfew for several days. All schools and state universities 
of  the  country  were  closed  for  two  weeks  following  the 
incident.  The  government  blocked  major  social  media 
platforms  to  prevent  the  spread  of  misinformation  that 
could lead to violence among communities. The operations 
of  the  Colombo  Stock  Exchange  were  also  temporarily 
suspended  on  22  April  2019.  It  took  about  two  weeks 
after the incident for civilian life and economic activities 
to show any sign of return to normalcy. Meanwhile, the 
Central Bank also adopted an accommodative monetary 
policy  stance  commencing  May  2019,  amidst  subpar 
economic growth that was further affected by the Easter 
Sunday attacks, decelerating private sector credit, muted 
inflation expectations and inflation outlook.
The  series  of  attacks  particularly  affected  the  tourism 
industry  tremendously,  while  causing  negative  spillover 
effects on several other sectors such as air transportation 
services,  domestic  transportation,  wholesale  and  retail 
trade  and  accommodation,  food  and  beverage  service 
activities, 
leisure 
and 
entertainment,  manufacturing 
of  food  and  beverages  and  agriculture.  The  exchange 
rate  also  experienced  some  pressure  in  the  immediate 
aftermath  of 
the  attacks,  with  withdrawals  of 
investment  from  the  government  securities  market.  The 
Colombo Stock Exchange also experienced a setback with 
a fall in price indices and market capitalisation. However, 
the exact economic impact of the terrorist attacks cannot 
be  quantified,  as  other  major  events,  such  as  global 
economic  and  financial  market  developments,  adverse 
weather conditions that prevailed throughout the second 
half of 2019 and the uncertainty that prevailed until the 
conclusion of the presidential election in the latter part of 
the  year,  also  impacted  the  economic  slowdown  in  the 
can be concluded that the attacks impacted the already 
sluggish economic growth, and largely contributed to the 
slow growth of 2.3 per cent in 2019.
The  fiscal  performance  deteriorated  in  2019,  with  the 
poor  revenue  collection  as  a  result  of  deceleration  in 
overall economic activity, partly due to the Easter Sunday 
attacks. 
In  addition,  government  expenditure 
estimated to have been increased with the implementation 
of relief packages facilitating the recovery of the affected 
parties,

security  measures,
