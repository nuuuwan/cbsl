    "text": "Energy is imperative for economic growth as it is a fundamental input for all economic activities including industrial production, transportation and household consumption. Though the gains from economic growth through increased energy consumption have been impressive across the globe, such high energy usage has far-reaching implications on environmental systems and the society mainly due to unsustainable practices. These unsustainable energy usage practices not only result in a rapid depletion of energy sources, but also cause climate change that can have detrimental effects on living beings as well as the environment. Though the basic need for energy cannot be changed, policymakers have identified the need to opt for more sustainable energy sources, due to adverse effects caused by fossil fuel based energy sources. Hence, management and development of energy sources are identified by the United Nations as core requirements for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Under the SDG-7, all countries are committed to provide \u2018access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all\u2019. In a broader sense, sustainable energy underpins almost all SDGs, particularly related to industrialisation, economic growth, sustainable cities, poverty reduction, health, education as well as climate change. The Paris Agreement - 2015, of which Sri Lanka is also a signatory, has recognised that carbon-intensive economic growth is no longer a route for sustainable development. Therefore, clean and sustainable energy sources should be the centre of Sri Lanka\u2019s sustainable development agenda.",

    "text": "Sustainable energy is a multidimensional concept that advocates the provision of adequate and reliable energy to both current and future generations, at affordable prices in an environmentally friendly manner. Sustainable energy usage includes three facets: first, environmental sustainability that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and harmful and toxic waste, and minimise adverse effects on biodiversity; second, social sustainability that encompasses poverty eradication, improving living standards and wellbeing of the people as well as energy security; third, economic sustainability that ensures low cost and affordability of energy sources, reliability of the energy supply and employment creation in relation to energy generation. Although renewable energy is generally referred to as sustainable energy sources, not all renewable energy projects are necessarily sustainable. For instance, biomass is renewable energy, but clearing of forests for biomass production and cultivation of plants for biomass production in a water scarce area are not environmentally sustainable practices. Therefore, renewable energy also needs to be used in a sustainable manner. All energy sources have their own advantages and disadvantages in relation to environmental, social and economic fronts.",

Generally, prices of non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuel are highly volatile due to demand and supply conditions, and are more prone to geopolitical tensions.

Hence, financial institutions are more likely to perceive renewable projects as risky, charging high interest rates on project borrowings. Generally, NCRE sources offer a decentralised generation model, in which, smaller generating stations are spread across a large area. Hence, cost of transmission is relatively high in such models where financing can be a significant barrier for both developers and end users. The average cost of generation is still perceived to be high for most NCREs in comparison to that of coal. However, many countries have been able to drastically reduce the cost of NCRE in recent years, through competitive bidding for energy procurement, government grants and subsidies for NCRE producers, especially for household level production, and duty waivers for the importation of solar PV panels. For instance, India has been able to reduce the cost of wind power to be on par or lower than the cost of energy generation from imported coal (Shrimali et. al., 2015). Moreover, the cost of setting up solar power plants in India has declined by 80 per cent between 2010 to 2018 and the country recorded the world\u2019s lowest installation cost of new solar power plants in 2018 (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2019b). Meanwhile, CEB\u2019s estimates of the cost of coal power generation does not include the cost of financing the coal power plant, whereas the estimate of the cost of NCRE comprises repayment of project costs to the NCRE producers by the CEB. Hence, the CEB\u2019s costs cannot be directly used to compare the costs of different energy sources. Accordingly, the World Bank and International Finance Corporation have estimated the",

    "text": "Though renewable energy resources are available around the world, many of these resources are intermittent energy sources and are not available year-round. Solar, wind, wave and tidal energy sources are intermittently available depending on the weather and the time of day. Most electricity grids are constructed to comply with nonintermittent energy sources such as fuel oil based or coal fired power plants. However, overall intermittency of the renewable energy sources can be reduced by using a combination of these sources. With more and more NCRE sources integrated into the system, grid modifications become necessary to ensure the supply of electricity is matched to daily variation in demand. Further, geographic limitations such as climate, topographies and vegetation also affect the installation of renewable energy plants. The extra challenge against solar power is recycling or disposing of solar panels without causing health and environmental hazards since they contain base metals such as lead, chromium, and cadmium. This can be a fairly costly process.",

    "text": "Sustainable energy usage is crucial for both economic and human development. Since the electricity and transportation sectors are energy-intensive activities, sustainable energy usage should be promoted in these sectors. In this regard, Sri Lanka needs to formulate an appropriate sustainable energy mix for electricity generation in consideration of long run economic costs as well as externalities of energy sources on the environment and society. Competitive bidding by electricity producers that use various energy sources should be encouraged to reduce overall cost of energy generation. As Sri Lanka is highly dependent on fossil fuels, the country faces a wide spectrum of challenges in the transition towards sustainable energy such as cost reflective energy pricing, grid modifications and energy conservation. Non-renewable energy sources are likely to be financially attractive than NCRE sources since financial costs of fuel oil and coal do not encompass the cost of environmental effects of those sources. Prior to the sharp decline in oil prices due the COVID-19 pandemic, most petroleum products in Sri Lanka were at subsidised prices without reflecting their true economic costs. Therefore, financial incentives are needed to make NCRE sources more financially attractive than non-renewable sources. Attractive feed-in tariffs, net metering systems, investment tax credits, subsidised interest rates for project loans, green bonds and soft loans are possible financial interventions to promote NCRE projects in the country.",

    "text": "Higher dependence on intermittent energy sources requires grid modifications to balance demand and supply conditions. When the share of NCRE in total electricity generation increases, Sri Lanka will need grid energy storage methods, such as pumped-storage hydroelectricity and batteries, to store and release excess energy when required. However, pumped-storage hydroelectricity is feasible only at locations near hills, and battery technologies are still expensive. Nevertheless, complementary energy sources such as hydroelectricity or natural gas can be used to produce backup power. In addition, reducing demand for electricity at certain times of the day through smart grid usage and energy demand management can also ease intermittency issues.",

For instance, improving the efficiency, reliability and comfort of public transport systems, increasing fuel efficient vehicle fleet, minimising travel by better urban designs, improving on-road fuel efficiency through better traffic management, promotion of low carbon fuels and encouraging people to shift to nonmotorised modes, including biking and walking, are some measures that can promote sustainable energy usage in the transport sector.",
