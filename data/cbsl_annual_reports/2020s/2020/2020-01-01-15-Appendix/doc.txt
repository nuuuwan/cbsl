Accordingly, Rs. 6,469 million was disbursed for the 2016 Yala season and the figure for 2016 is only for the 2015/16 Maha season, while Rs. 10,304 million was disbursed for 2017. Further, Rs. 8,002 million was disbursed for the 2017/18 Maha season. Cash grant system was eliminated w.e.f. the 2018 Yala season. Hence the figure for 2018 is only for the 2018 Yala season.

(b) The exchange rates have been defined in terms of indices so that the appreciation/depreciation of the rupee relative to other currencies is directly reflected by a rise/fall in the values of the effective exchange rates indices, respectively.

(c) The NEER is the weighted average of nominal exchange rates of the 24 trading partner and competitor countries.

Weights are based on the trade shares reflecting the relative importance of each currency in the currency basket.

(d) The REER is computed by adjusting the NEER for inflation differentials (based on CCPI) with the countries whose currencies are included in the basket. The REER Indices for 2019 are provisional.

(Contd.)(a) M2b is based on the aggregated data pertaining to both Domestic Banking Units (DBUs) and Offshore Banking Units (OBUs) of Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) operating in Sri Lanka. Definitional changes have been adopted in aggregating DBUs and OBUs to avoid double counting and misclassification of assets and liabilities. The major changes are:

(1) All DBU placements with OBUs are recorded as domestic assets, while all DBU borrowings from OBUs are recorded as domestic liabilities.

(2) Foreign currency deposits with DBUs are classified on the basis of ownership rather than on the basis of currency. Hence, the following apply: (i) One half (50 per cent) of Non Resident Foreign Currency (NRFC) deposits are treated as

domestic deposit liabilities

(ii) All Resident Non National Foreign Currency (RNNFC) balances are treated as foreign liabilities

(iii) All other domestic foreign currency accounts are treated as domestic deposit liabilities(b) External assets (net) of the Central Bank and commercial banks (including outward bills)(c) Currency and demand deposits held by the public(d) Time and savings deposits of the public held with commercial banks(e) This includes NFA of the Central Bank as well as the government’s Crown Agent’s balance reported by the Department of State Accounts.(f) DFCC Bank which operated as a Licensed Specialised Bank was amalgamated with the DFCC Vardhana Bank and operates as a Licensed Commercial Bank namely, DFCC Bank PLC with effect from 1 October 2015.

(a) Under Sections 10c, 93, 94, 96 and 97 of the amended Monetary Law Act (Chapter 422), commercial banks and other financial institutions are required to maintain reserves against their deposit liabilities as prescribed by the Monetary Board. Currently, only commercial banks are subject to reserve requirements. With effect from 24 January 1992, an amount of till cash over and above two per cent of the total deposit liabilities, but not exceeding four per cent, could be maintained as a part of required reserves in the form of Sri Lanka currency notes and coins. Details of required reserve ratios, which were applicable in the past and computation methods have been published in the Appendix table on the ‘Reserve Position of Commercial Banks’ in the Annual Reports prior to 2003. (b) With effect from June 2013, the basis for computing the Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR) was changed and 7 day reserve calculation and maintenance periods were increased to two periods per month, first from 1st to 15th and the second from 16th to end of each month. Up to May 2013, Reserve data were for the last reserve week of each month and from June 2013 onwards, Reserve data are for the second reserve period of each month. The required reserves recorded in the table refer to the cumulative reserves for the

reserve period, while commercial bank deposits with the Central Bank are the cumulative deposits for that particular period. Excess/Deficit on SRR is the difference between the cumulative SRR for the reserve period and cumulative deposits of the commercial banks for the period.(c) Excludes interbank deposits(d) SRR was increased from 6.00 per cent to 7.50 per cent with effect from 16 January 2016 and subsequently reduced by 1.50 percentage points to 6.00 per cent from 7.50 per cent with effect from the reserve maintenance period commencing 16 November 2018. Further, SRR was reduced from 6.00 per cent to 5.00 per cent with effect from the reserve maintenance period conmencing 01 March 2019.(e) DFCC Bank which operated as a Licensed Specialised Bank was amalgamated with the DFCC Vardhana Bank and operates as a Licensed Commercial Bank namely, DFCC Bank PLC with effect from 1 October 2015.(f) With effect from October 2018 a Margin Deposit Requirement on Letter of Credit/Documents against acceptance terms was imposed. The balances of these margin accounts are included in the Total Reserves.
