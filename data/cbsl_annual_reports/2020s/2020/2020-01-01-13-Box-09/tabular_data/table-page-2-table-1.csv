Figure B 9.1 depicts the path of recovery in tourist arrivals 
after the Easter Sunday attacks, in response to the measures 
taken to revive the industry. Tourist arrivals experienced a 
drastic drop of 71 per cent (year-on-year) in May 2019. 
tourist  arrivals  picked  up  gradually 
following 3 months and demonstrated a dip in September 
before increasing sharply towards the end of the year, by 
the beginning of the tourist season. Accordingly, arrivals 
in  the  month  of  November  recorded  only  a  decline  of  
this  decline 
further 
lowered 
4.5 per cent in December. These statistics indicate that 
Sri  Lanka’s  tourism  sector  almost  completely  recovered 
within  7  months  after  the  terrorist  attacks,  which  is  less 
than the average time of 13 months as estimated by the 
World Travel and Tourism Council. However, the negative

tourism  promotion, 
financial and fiscal support to sectors directly linked to the 
tourism sector. Accordingly, an economic relief package, 
including  a  debt  moratorium,  was  introduced  in  May 
2019,  on  both  capital  and  interest  payments  related 
to  credit  facilities  obtained  by  registered  businesses  in 
the  tourism  industry.  This  moratorium  which  was  to  be 
valid  until  end  March  2020  has  been  extended  due  to 
the  outbreak  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  In  addition 
to  the  debt  moratorium,  a  separate  relief  package  was 
introduced  by  the  government,  in  May  2019,  focusing 
mainly  on  informal  sector  stakeholders  of  the  tourism 
sector. Moreover, licensed commercial banks were also 
permitted  to  use  the  funds  in  Jaya  Isura  loan  scheme 
under the government’s Enterprise Sri Lanka programme 
and  the  Saubagya  loan  scheme  of  the  Central  Bank 
of  Sri  Lanka  to  grant  working  capital  facilities  to  those 
who are engaged in the tourism industry. Further, Value 
Added Tax (VAT) on registered hotels and tour operators 
was  reduced  to  7  per  cent  from  15  per  cent  for  the 
period  of  01  June  2019  to  30  November  2019  while","SLTPB  also  launched  15  special  promotional  packages 
for reservations made through the travel agent network in 
India. Routine promotional activities in identified markets 
were  conducted  by  way  of  travel  and  tourism  fairs  and 
road  shows  while  also  carrying  out  outdoor  advertising 
campaigns 
in  subway  stations  abroad.  These  efforts 
were  complemented  by  a  digital  advertising  campaign 
and  a  television  campaign  in  collaboration  with  CNN. 
The  subsequent  improvement  in  the  security  conditions 
of  the  country  and  continued  promotional  activities,  by 
in 
the 
both private sector and government stakeholders of the 
tourism industry, contributed to the faster recovery of the 
tourism sector.
The country’s ability to regain the momentum of economic 
to  
activity after a terror attack or any other crisis situation 
at  a  faster  pace  depends  on  the  availability  of  robust 
contingency  plans,  disaster  recovery  programmes  and 
risk management protocols. Therefore, being proactive, 
rather than reactive, is a critical factor in an event of a 
crisis. In this aspect, aligning law and order authorities, 
civil society, tourism authorities and the media to face 
such  crises  is  essential  for  the  success  in  improving 
business  and  tourism  resilience.    Sri  Lanka  has,  from 
time to time, proven its ability to withstand many tragic 
events, including a 30-year armed conflict, devastation 
by  a  Tsunami  and  the  Easter  Sunday  attacks.  Despite 
the  gradual  recovery,  many  global  vulnerabilities,  the 
latest  being  the  COVID-19  pandemic  are  bound  to 
impact the country’s tourism sector and other economic 
activities.  Therefore,  emergency  preparedness  from  all 
perspectives,  including  macroeconomic  policy,  is  vital 
in  improving  the  country’s  resilience  to  handle  such 
unforeseen  events, 
thereby  minimising 
their  adverse 
economic and social impact.
