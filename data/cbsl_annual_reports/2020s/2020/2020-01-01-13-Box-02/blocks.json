To date, the pandemic has left an unprecedented trail of both humanitarian and economic damage in all countries. With 2.5 million people infected and more than 150,000 deaths by mid April, the economic repercussions of the ongoing \u2018Great Lockdown\u2019 are expected to dwarf the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-08. Policymakers around the world are struggling to grapple with this crisis episode amidst numerous uncertainties. While Sri Lanka has been relatively successful in combating the outbreak thus far, as a result of early measures adopted to contain the spread, the interplay of setbacks to domestic economic activity stemming from such containment measures and spillover effects from the global economy are likely to have a notable impact on the Sri Lankan economy during the year.",

Despite introducing awareness measures that had prevented any outbreak till early March, the continued arrival of tourists, the return of Sri Lankans from countries that were most affected by the virus, and the lack of adherence to the containment measures that were imposed from mid March 2020 fuelled the outbreak. Nevertheless, efforts to restrict the mobility of people by enforcing police curfew in the country, the closure of airports from 19 March 2020, and actions to quarantine returnees from abroad helped to largely contain the spread \u2013 the identified pockets are mainly clustered in a few areas in the Western Province and the Districts of Puttalam and Jaffna. The government established two high level units to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, while easing the difficulties faced by the public amidst restrictions imposed on mobility. Accordingly, the National Operation Centre for Prevention of the COVID-19 Outbreak coordinates the preventive and management measures of the outbreak, while ensuring the provision of healthcare and other services to the general public.

The declaration of holidays, curfew, restricted public services and other measures to contain human movement including the shutdown of airports and seaports for passenger traffic will affect several key economic sectors. The socio-economic impact could also be extensive with the loss of income and livelihoods for a large segment of society. With approximately 60 per cent of those employed being engaged in the informal sector and an estimated 1.9 million being daily wage earners, a large number of households is likely to be in a precarious position. Other vulnerable segments of the population, such as the elderly and the large number of people living just above the poverty threshold, will be disproportionately affected by this episode.

However, such positive effects have thus far been negated by the capital flow reversals that are being seen across emerging market economies, including Sri Lanka. Although Sri Lanka\u2019s exposure to short term capital flows is marginal, this has resulted in the sharp escalation of Sri Lanka\u2019s international sovereign bond yields, similar to the experience of other emerging market and developing economies.
