    "text": "Sri Lanka was predominantly an agrarian economy with a somewhat higher per capita income compared to other developing countries, when it became a self governing nation in 1948. Subsequent governments that came to power adopted numerous policies aiming to stimulate growth and enhance welfare. Apart from policy swings, the internal conflict and youth uprisings caused severe damage to the economy, including loss of human capital and resources, while curtailing the fiscal space on investing in development projects, and preventing the economy from reaping expected benefits of various types of policy reforms introduced from time to time. With the end of the internal conflict in 2009, the economy started to unleash its potential along with large infrastructure development, recording above 8 per cent growth on average in the three years that followed, accompanied by rebounding investor confidence. Sri Lanka was progressing well towards graduating into an upper middle income country, but the progress slowed amidst subdued economic growth over the subsequent years (Figure B 3.1) due to various reasons.",

These developments are also reflected in increased ranking in the infrastructure sector of the 2019 Global Competitiveness Index by 4 positions to 61, endorsing Sri Lanka to become the most improved economy in the South Asian region in the overall index.4 Exemplary diplomatic relationships garnered from the friendly, non aligned foreign policy followed by the nation since independence could be harnessed to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as well as to foster the country\u2019s international trade performance. Further, recent measures taken by the government to improve female participation in the active labour force could support inclusive economic growth.",

    "text": "It is worth noting that exports and FDI have been key drivers of growth in many successful economies in Asia. However, Sri Lanka\u2019s progress in terms of exports and FDI has been subpar compared to its regional counterparts. Sri Lanka has not been able to diversify exports and its share in global trade has declined over time, unlike its East Asian neighbours, and its exports structure has not evolved to the next level beyond apparel, tea and rubber products since the early 1990s. Anti export bias, lack of private domestic and foreign investment in the tradable, particularly industry sector, lack of innovation and research and development (R&D) have further deepened the woes of the exports sector. Meanwhile, the volatile economic and political climate together with the bureaucratic and restrictive investment climate have deterred foreign investment inflows to Sri Lanka. These developments have led to the widening of the external current account deficit forcing the country to increasingly rely on foreign borrowings to finance such deficits.",

Female labour force participation in Sri Lanka and in the region, has remained significantly lower than economies like China and those in the ASEAN region, and this is a serious concern for Sri Lanka given its large pool of highly educated females who are neither employed nor looking for work. In addition, inadequate exposure to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education at secondary, higher education and university levels, has created a low skilled workforce that is unfit to serve the needs of present day employers and to create entrepreneurs.",

The share of the elderly is projected to increase to 25.7 per cent of the total population by 2050 compared to 13.4 per cent in 2015. This implies a contraction of the labour force, lower productivity, greater fiscal burden in the form of healthcare and elderly care, and high retirement benefit costs in the future. In fact, according to the World Social Protection Report (2017-2019), less than one third of the Sri Lankan population is covered by at least one social protection benefit scheme and only around 25 per cent of old age citizens are receiving a pension.",

It is equally important to develop and support industries that require high skilled labour, so that the demand for such graduates would also be high. Therefore, in the context of Sri Lanka, the country needs to focus not only on the supply of experts by supporting science and technology related fields of higher education, but also needs to increase the demand for such experts. Experiences of the recent past highlight that many graduates migrate following the completion of their studies, leaving behind a heavy fiscal burden given the free education system in the country. Also, many graduates seem to favour government jobs over private sector employment preferring higher job security, despite the higher wage levels in the private sector, especially in sectors requiring higher skills. This phenomenon suggests an already existing shortage of such experts in the private sector, as highlighted by Nedelkoska, O\u2019Brien and Stock (2018). Therefore, within the government\u2019s initiatives to broaden the university intake, further efforts are imperative to widen access to tertiary education to match the demands of the labour market. At the same time, studies including Delalibera and Ferreira (2019) have found evidence suggesting that the quality of early childhood education can contribute to increased levels of labour productivity, and Sri Lanka also needs to improve the quality of the primary and secondary layers of the education system. Improvements to the quality of the labour force achievable through such measures could also be beneficial in facing the country\u2019s emerging demographic challenges.",

In many developing Asian countries, the importance given to intellectual property rights is low when compared to its Western counterparts. In the case of Sri Lanka, the existing laws and regulations are quite extensive in protecting intellectual property rights established by foreign entities, but attempts to establish intellectual property rights for local innovators and inventions are slow and involve tedious processes, thus discouraging innovation as it is difficult for inventors to obtain economic gains from their efforts. Thus, from a policy perspective, it is important to take measures to improve awareness of intellectual property rights and to ensure enforcement of such rules and regulations, while actively supporting local innovators to establish such rights domestically and abroad.",

A well developed entrepreneurial culture of a country underpinned by a conducive environment to conduct business, enables the economy to move ahead in terms of attracting investments, thereby boosting overall economic activity. As per Doing Business 2020,5 Sri Lanka holds the 99th position out of 190 economies for ease of doing business, remaining below its regional peers. India managed to raise its ranking through streamlining its reform strategies giving priority to the Doing Business indicators. Countries like Vietnam have upgraded their information technology infrastructure to make it easy to pay taxes. Recently, Sri Lanka too, made a few efforts to upgrade the information technology infrastructure by introducing online systems for filing taxes, processing constructions permits and business registration. With a view to facilitating and attracting foreign investments, the Board of Investment (BOI) has introduced an online application tracking system. The relatively poor score of Sri Lanka on the ease of doing business indicates that there is ample room for further improvement. In Sri Lanka, a lack of improvements can be observed in the areas of getting credit, enforcing contracts, especially in terms of the time and cost spent on resolving a commercial dispute and the quality of the judicial process as well as resolving insolvency considering the recovery rate and reinforcement of the legal framework for insolvency. Further developments can be achieved through government involvement in evolving the country\u2019s entrepreneurship by implementing broad minded, long term policies and programmes that offer opportunities for entrepreneurs.",

    "text": "For decades, Sri Lanka, as a twin deficit country, has been relying on domestic and foreign borrowings for financing deficits. With a view to strengthening the fiscal position and maintaining government debt at a sustainable level, successive governments have pursued fiscal consolidation strategies, augmenting revenue by expanding the tax base, improving tax administration and compliance, while also rationalising expenditures. Recent tax reform initiatives including those aimed at improving tax administration, are expected to make the country\u2019s tax system simpler, while improving business confidence. As government expenditure also remains high, it is crucial for the government to increasingly focus on rationalising expenditure alongside fiscal consolidation measures with a proper monitoring process of government expenditure, without compromising essential public investment. These measures are important in the effort of moving toward becoming a high income country, as unsustainable levels of budget deficits and debt lead to macroeconomic instability, thereby hindering growth. In addition, the government needs to strengthen its efforts on reforming and restructuring State Owned Business Enterprises, thereby enhancing their financial viability and helping to reduce central government expenditure, while inculcating greater discipline in fiscal affairs.",

    "text": "Sri Lanka, once considered a promising emerging and developing economy and famously referred to as the \u201cWonder of Asia\u201d with the dawn of peace in 2009, has to tread through rough waters over the past several years resulting in poor macroeconomic performance, particularly in terms of subpar growth and rising external and fiscal sector vulnerabilities. The absence of national economic policies, delayed implementation of the required structural reforms and the inability to build sufficient policy spaces have led the country to lose its steam as a fast growing economy in the region, amidst domestic political uncertainties, the Easter Sunday attacks, and frequent natural disasters. Moreover, uncertainties in the global front have also posed significant challenges to domestic economic activity. In spite of these drawbacks, Sri Lanka has managed to make steady progress in terms of reducing poverty, upgrading human capital, promoting good governance, fostering healthy international diplomatic and economic relations with key development partners, and maintaining single digit inflation for over a decade, to name a few. It is expected that these factors, together with the country\u2019s natural strengths and the implementation of appropriate policy reforms, particularly to address the deficiencies highlighted above, would set the stage for Sri Lanka to takeoff and reemerge as the economic miracle of Asia.",
