The licensed bank shall at the time of early withdrawal recover any excess interest that may have been paid above the interest amount so computed during the period the deposit was held. However, banks may apply a different formula that would result in the interest and any benefit paid on the early withdrawal of the deposit not exceeding the amount of interest that would have been paid from the application of the formula given in this Direction provided that the basis of calculation is made known to the depositor at the time of making the deposit.",
