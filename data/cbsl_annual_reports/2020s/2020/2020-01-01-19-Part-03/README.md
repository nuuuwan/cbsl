SAVINGS AND TIME DEPOSITS OF LICENSED BANKS

2.Incentive schemes not permitted2.1Licensed banks shall not conduct:

SUPPLEMENT TO CIRCULAR NO. 04 OF 2018 ON ADOPTION OF SRI LANKA ACCOUNTING STANDARD - SLFRS 9: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN LICENSED BANKS

1. On 31 December 2018, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) issued Guidelines to licensed banks on SLFRS 9 to be adopted within the requirements of SLFRS 9, promoting consistent and prudent application of same in the banking sector.

2. The Monetary Board, considering the representations made by the licensed banks and the Report of the Working Group on high market interest rates and issues faced by Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) has decided that licensed banks may adopt the following as an interim measure in respect of the adoption of SLFRS 9 during a transitional period with the approval of their Board of Directors.

(i) With reference to the requirements set out in Section 1.2 of Annex I to the Guidelines to Licensed Banks on the Adoption of Sri Lanka Accounting Standard - SLFRS 9: Financial Instruments issued by CBSL on 31.12.2018, licensed banks may

Part III

Part III - 9

rebut the 30-day rebuttable presumption on significant increase of credit risk to 60 days, subject to internally approved procedures laid down by the Board of Directors, for a temporary period between 01.01.2019 to 30.06.2020 with respect to credit facilities granted to SMEs up to an aggregate loan limit of Rs. 25 million per SME.

(ii) With reference to sections 1.2(b) and 1.3(b) of the Annex I of the above Circular, licensed banks may exempt credit facilities granted to SMEs up to an aggregate loan limit of Rs. 25 million per SME, which are subsequently restructured between 01.01.2019 to 30.06.2020.

(iii) Further, it is reiterated that in terms of the above guidelines, a credit facility shall be considered as restructured only if, original repayment terms have been amended due to a deterioration in credit quality, while the respective credit facility remained as performing in terms of CBSL Directions (including Temporary Overdrafts). An extension of the facility is possible without having to incur an impairment charge if there was an underlying business case and there was no significant increase in credit risk. The internal policies of the bank approved by its Board of Directors should set out the factors to be considered in assessing the credit risk when the original repayment terms are changed or extended.

(iv) During the interim period up to 30.06.2020, licensed banks may take steps to analyse and back test their portfolios of advances to the SME sector and develop models to compute the expected loss provisions for this segment or any sub segment thereof.

(v) Further, in lieu of Temporary Overdrafts, the licensed banks may devise products to facilitate short-term revolving funds to SMEs assessing the risk and pricing of such products at reasonable rates.

Explanatory Note No. 03 of 2019 18 July 2019

Interpretations for Banking Act Directions No. 01 of 2016 on Capital Requirements under Basel III for Licensed Commercial Banks and Licensed Specialised Banks

The banking sector in Sri Lanka has adopted Sri Lanka Accounting Standard - SLFRS 9: Financial Instruments for financial reporting periods beginning on or after 01.01.2018 as stipulated by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka. Currently, when computing capital adequacy ratio under the above Directions the Capital Measure is calculated on Sri Lanka Accounting Standards based figures and Risk Weighted Assets (RWA) are computed based on the balance sheet prepared for regulatory reporting in line with Directions issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

In order to implement a consistent approach to measure Capital and RWA when computing capital adequacy ratio, the following measures are introduced:

1. Impairment eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 capital under web based return code 20.2.3.1.1.3 - General Provisions

100 per cent of impairment for assets in Stage 1 and 50 per cent of impairment for assets in Stage 2 under SLFRS subject to a maximum limit of 1.25 per cent of RWA on credit risk under the Standardised Approach shall be eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 capital. Accordingly, licensed banks shall report the eligible impairment under the web-based return code 20.2.3.1.1.3.

2. Application of Risk Weights for Non-Performing Assets (NPA)

2.1 Impairment for NPA other than qualifying residential mortgage loans

Impairment for assets in stage 3 under SLFRS shall be deducted from the respective credit exposures to arrive at net exposure1 and risk weighted as follows:

(i) Web-based return code 20.3.1.11.1.0 – licensed banks shall report unsecured portion of NPA, other than qualifying residential mortgage loans, where stage 3 impairment under SLFRS is equal to or more than 20 per cent of the carrying value of the respective financial asset or group of assets.

1 In the case of collective impairment where it is not possible to identify the impairment with specific assets, licensed banks shall apportion the impairment charges on a pro rata basis.

Part III

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2019

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

Part III - 17

(ii) Web-based return code 20.3.1.11.2.0 - licensed banks shall report unsecured portion of NPA, other than qualifying residential mortgage loans, where stage 3 impairment under SLFRS is less than 20 per cent of the carrying value of the respective financial asset or group of assets.

2.2 Impairment for NPA secured by Residential Property

Impairment for assets in stage 3 under SLFRS shall be deducted from the respective credit exposures to arrive at net exposure1 and risk weighted as follows:

(i) Web-based return code 20.3.1.12.1.0 - licensed banks shall report NPA secured by residential property, where stage 3 impairment under SLFRS is equal to or more than 20 per cent of the carrying value of the respective financial asset or group of assets.

(ii) Web-based return code 20.3.1.12.2.0 - licensed banks shall report NPA secured by residential property, where stage 3 impairment under SLFRS is less than 20 per cent of the carrying value of the respective financial asset or group of assets.

3. Foreign Claims on Central Government

(i) Web-based return code 20.3.1.1.1.2 - Licensed banks shall deduct respective SLFRS based impairment charge, if any, from claims on foreign currency denominated securities issued by Government of Sri Lanka before applying the risk weight when computing the capital charge under Basel III.

Monetary Law Act Order No. 02 of 2019 24 September 2019

ENHANCING EFFICIENCY OF THE TRANSMISSION OF RECENT POLICY DECISIONS TO RUPEE

DENOMINATED MARKET LENDING RATES

Issued under Section 104(1)(b) of the Monetary Law Act, No. 58 of 1949, as amended.

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has adopted several policy measures in the recent past such as reduction of policy interest rates and the statutory reserve ratio, and imposition of maximum interest rates on Sri Lanka Rupee (LKR) deposits to reduce cost of funds of licensed commercial banks (LCBs) and licensed specialised banks (LSBs), thereby reducing interest rates of lending products in the banking sector. However, due to the unduly long time lag observed in transmitting the reduction of policy and deposit rates broadly and equitably to interest rates of lending products, the Monetary Board hereby issues an Order on the interest rates applicable on LKR denominated loans and advances granted by LCBs and LSBs, while taking cognisance of differences in their funding structures.

1.Empowerment under the Monetary Law Act1.1 In terms of Section 104(1)(b) of the Monetary Law Act, the Monetary Board may from time to time fix the maximum rates of interest which LCBs and LSBs may charge for different types of loans or other credit operations.

2.Interest rates on LKR denominated loans and advances2.1 Every LCB and LSB shall reduce the annual nominal interest rate applicable for all LKR denominated loans and advances, excluding credit facilities mentioned in Order 2.3 and credit facilities exempted under Order 5 below, by at least 200 basis points by 15.10.2019, in comparison to the interest rate applicable to the respective loans and advances as at 30.04.2019.

2.2 However, if the annual nominal interest rate applicable to any LKR denominated loan or advance as at the date of this Order or anytime thereafter is 12.5 per cent or lower, it shall not be mandatory to give effect to the reduction required under Order 2.1 above. Further, in cases where the applicable annual nominal interest rate as at the date of this Order or anytime thereafter is 12.5 per cent or less, the bank shall not increase the interest rates of such loans and advances from the level maintained as at the date of this Order.

2.3 Every LCB shall reduce the following product-wise lending rates to the maximum levels outlined herein, by 01.11.2019:(i) Interest rates on credit card advances to 28 per cent per annum.(ii) Interest rates on pre-arranged temporary overdrafts to 24 per cent per annum.

2.4 Every LCB and LSB shall reduce the penal interest rates charged on all loans and advances, including credit facilities already granted, to a level not exceeding 400 basis points per annum, for the amount in excess of an approved limit or in arrears, during the overdue period, with effect from 15.10.2019.

3.Maximum Average Weighted Prime Lending Rate (AWPR)3.1 (i) Every LCB shall reduce its weekly AWPR by at least 250 basis points by 27.12.2019, compared to its AWPR published by CBSL as at 26.04.2019 in the Weekly Economic Indicators publication.

(ii) In the interim, every LCB shall reduce its weekly AWPR by at least 150 basis points by 01.11.2019, compared to its AWPR published by CBSL as at 26.04.2019.

3.2 If the Weekly Economic Indicators published by CBSL as at 26.04.2019 does not contain AWPR of an LCB, such LCB shall maintain an AWPR not exceeding 9.5 per cent per annum.

3.3 Order 3.1 above shall not apply to LCBs, whose AWPR reaches or falls below 9.5 per cent per annum as at the date of this Order or anytime thereafter. However, such LCB shall not increase its weekly AWPR above 9.5 per cent.

3.4 Upon complying with Order 3.1 above, any LCB shall not increase its AWPR from the reduced level.

4.Monitoring4.1 All LCBs and LSBs shall ensure the accuracy of interest rate data submitted to CBSL and maintain internal documented records electronically or manually, in relation to the reductions in interest rates in respect of each loan and advance to which this Order applies

5.Exemptions5.1 Following categories of loans and advances shall be exempted from the requirements in Order 2 above.

(i) Loans and advances granted before 15.10.2019 on fixed term interest rate contracts, until the end of the contracted fixed rate period. For avoidance of doubt these will include, leases and facilities collateralised by gold where applicable. However, the provisions of this Order shall apply to any revision to the annual nominal interest rate effected on or after 15.10.2019.

(ii) Loans and advances collateralised by LKR deposits maintained with LCBs and LSBs, provided that the margin over the deposit rate is not increased above the margin applied by the bank to such advances as at the date of this Order.

(iii) Loans and advances granted under a refinance scheme supported by the Government of Sri Lanka or CBSL or on concessionary terms under a general restructuring arrangement where the applicable interest rate or the basis of its determination is stipulated in such scheme or arrangement.

6.Implementation6.1 These Orders shall be effective from the date of the Order.

Requirements (HLA) as capital surcharge on D-SIBs having regard to the guidelines issued by the Basel Committee on Banking

Part III - 59

e) a trust or company service provider not otherwise covered by this definition, which as a business provides and one or more of the following services to third parties :-

(iv) acting as or arranging for another person to act as, a trustee of an express trust;

(v) acting as or arranging for another person to act as, a nominee shareholder for another person.

5. Section 7 (1) of the FTRA requires:

“Where an Institution -

a) has reasonable grounds to suspect that any transaction or attempted transaction may be related to the commission of any unlawful activity or any other criminal offence;

or

b) has information that it suspects may be relevant-

i. to an act preparatory to an offence under the provisions of the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act, No. 25 of 2005;

ii. to an investigation or prosecution of a person or persons for an act constituting an unlawful activity, or may otherwise be of assistance in the enforcement of the Money Laundering Act, No. 5 of 2006 and the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act, No. 25 of 2005,

the Institution shall, as soon as practicable, after forming that suspicion or receiving the information, but no later than two working days therefrom, report the transaction or attempted transaction or the information to the FIU”.

Such reports are herein referred to as Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs).

6. As specified above, all DNFBs are required to report STRs to the FIU.

7. DNFBs are required to establish and maintain procedures and systems to implement the reporting requirement under Section 7 of the FTRA. Further, the FTRA requires DNFBs to train its officers, employees and agents to recognize suspicious transactions.

8. As per the Rule 6 (f) and 6 (g) (iii) of the Designated Non-Finance Business (Customer Due Diligence) Rules, No. 1 of 2018 (CDD Rules), DNFBs are required to formulate an internal AML/CFT Policy approved by its Senior Management or Board of Directors and that policy must include procedures and controls on reporting suspicious transactions to the FIU.

9. Under the FTRA every DNFB is required to maintain the records of transactions and of correspondence relating to transactions and records of all reports furnished to the FIU for a period of six years from the date of the transaction, correspondence or the furnishing of the report, as the case may be. ‘All reports furnished to the FIU’ shall also include the records of STRs.

Importance of Reporting Suspicious Transactions

10. Reporting of suspicious transactions is an important mode of detection of money laundering, terrorist financing and related transactions of proceeds of crime.

11. Reporting of suspicious transactions is a major function of an effective AML/CFT programme of an Institution.

12. For the AML/CFT function to be meaningful, it must result an effective implementation of the FTRA, and other Rules and Regulations issued thereunder. Ineffective implementation can result in DNFBs either submitting STRs that are inaccurate, incomplete or inappropriate or DNFBs failing to report suspicious transactions entirely. Such failures expose the DNFBs to regulatory, reputational, operational, and legal risks. In some cases, such failures may also expose both natural and legal persons to criminal liability.

13. Whatever the source of customer information and knowledge of transactions, there must be an institutional will to make the system work. That is, there must be the will of the DNFB to detect suspicious transactions, to recognize in good faith such suspicious transactions, and fully and accurately report such transactions when recognized. Such institutional will and implementation is most effective when there is a clear commitment from those at the Senior Management level

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2019

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

including the Board of Directors/Owners of the DNFBs and propagated through concrete actions and demonstrations to the rest of the staff of the DNFBs (e.g. development of effective internal policies, processes and training programmes, audits of AML/CFT functions).

14. The key to being able to identify unusual and possibly suspicious transactions is the DNFB’s knowledge of their customer and the customer’s business and related transactions.

Suspicion

15. DNFBs must develop their own operating definition for suspicion. It may incorporate persistent feelings of doubt about circumstances relating to a behavior, to a single transaction, to a series of transactions, an attempted transaction or to any combination thereof. It can be a feeling that something is not as it was expected to be, or as it was explained to be, given the totality of knowledge of the circumstances in which that something exists. The feeling of doubt cannot be relieved by proof, since proof will rarely be available. The definition should allow formation of a belief that is not necessarily firmly grounded or perfectly clear. At the same time, the definition should not allow these beliefs to be fanciful or brief. Certainly, the definition should count as suspicious behaviors and activities that are unusual for the circumstances and not adequately or credibly explained.

The operating definition for suspicion must pass a test of reasonableness. If the definition is too narrow or rigid, it may exclude transactions which are unanticipated unlawful circumstances and may also result in avoidance behavior by criminals. On the other hand, a definition that is too broad or flexible might result in large number of STRs that do not reflect possible unlawful circumstances. Suspicious indicators and typologies may be the main element of identifying such suspicious transactions and “unusual” patterns of behavior and transactions should also be considered in identifying such suspicions.

A non-exhaustive and unofficial list of suspicious indicators for transactions and behaviours is provided in Appendix I. The DNFBs should identify and prepare their own indicators based on nature and size of its business. When using indicators, the DNFBs need to consider that these indicators are not formulae and do not necessarily indicate criminal activity. The DNFB’s identification of suspicious transactions should not be limited to the circumstances set out in the indicators but should ultimately be based on the knowledge of the customer and the customer’s business and related transactions.

16. After gaining a thorough understanding of the FTRA and other Rules, Regulations, Circulars and Guidelines issued thereunder and after consideration of facts and circumstances available to the DNFBs and if such facts are identified in good faith and within the context of the DNFB’s understanding of suspicion and risks for the DNFB, transactions that are deemed “suspicious” must be reported to the FIU regardless of the amount of the transaction.

17. DNFBs are not expected to establish the unlawful activity before submitting the STR to the FIU rather they may report the unusual circumstances surrounding a transaction or transactions or set of behaviours that lead to a suspicion.

Reporting of STRs

18. The STR duly completed and signed by the Compliance Officer must be submitted to the FIU using Schedule V of the Suspicious Transactions (Format) Regulations of 2017 (Appendix II).

19. The DNFB must submit STRs in writing through the prescribed format and these may be delivered by way of mail, fax or electronic mail or such other manner as may be determined by the FIU.

20. The suspicion may be informed through telephone; however it must be followed up in writing within twenty-four hours through the prescribed format.

Timing of Reporting

21. The Section 7 (1) of the FTRA requires STRs to be submitted to the FIU as soon as practicably possible but no later than two working days after formation of a suspicion. This means that, regardless of the respective DNFBs’ processes, procedures and steps after the initial formation of suspicion, the suspicion itself must be reported even if the DNFB’s process has not been completed. The process of the DNFB for dealing with suspicion may proceed concurrently with the filing of an STR. It is to be noted that the suspicion can be formed at any time for the business relationship with customer and at any stage of the business relationship - for example – as suspicion can be formed when establishing the business relationship, when verifying the identity, when the DNFB is monitoring the accounts and transactions of the customers.

For example, a customer approaches a real estate agent to purchase an apartment. He continually emphasized that he does not want his name to be appeared in any document relating to the property and instead requested to include a non-related third party’s name in all the documents. This formed an immediate suspicion about the customer and as soon as practicable but within two working days from the transaction this suspicion should be reported to the FIU while the DNFB may continue with its internal processes to verify the authenticity and details of the payment.

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

Part III - 61

22. If, after sending the STR, the DNFB discovers additional facts and circumstances to either support or refute the initial suspicion after sending the STR, then the DNFB should provide such additional information to the FIU appropriately.

Content of Reporting

23. Completeness: A single STR must stand alone and contain complete information about the suspicion. An STR should provide a full picture of the suspicion itself as well as the circumstances that gave rise to and support that suspicion. Where multiple transactions and/or behaviours are connected with a suspicion, a single STR should be filed capturing all of these.

24. Form Narrative: The narrative portion of the STR is most important. When submitting the STR, the DNFB may provide full detailed narrative in the Schedule V of the Suspicious Transactions (Format) Regulations of 2017. The narrative should attempt to answer to the extent possible the basic descriptive questions of what, who, when, where, why and how.

The DNFB should provide clear quantitative and qualitative data as much as possible such as;

• Amount of money involved

• Place where the respective transaction was made

• The date of the transaction(s)

Some of the questions that the narrative should attempt to answer, if possible, include:

Common attributes to be questioned;

• What is the nature of the suspicion?

• Any likely offenses that may have been committed?

• What transactions, attempted transactions, behaviours, facts, beliefs and circumstances are involved and relevant to the suspicion?

• Who are the natural and legal persons involved?

• Who are the beneficial owners (if relevant)?

• What identifying information such as names, ID numbers, registration numbers, etc. is available?

• What are the addresses/locations involved?

• What are their occupations or types of business?

• Who are their employers?

• What political exposure do they have, if any?

• How are they connected with each other and with the transactions?

• What were their roles in the transactions?

• When and where did the transactions or attempted transactions or behaviours occur?

• How does the timing or location of the transactions contribute to the suspicion?

• Why do these facts and circumstances support the suspicion?

• How was the suspicion formed?

• Actions taken by the DNFB, if any?

• Are there any related STRs already submitted by the DNFB?

The narrative should be structured in a logical manner so that information can be conveyed to the FIU as efficiently, completely and accurately as possible. Essay formats could be used for an STR narratives i.e. having an introduction, a body, and a conclusion. Paragraph breaks can be used to divide the narrative into logical units and enhance readability.

25. Accuracy: It is imperative that factual information provided in the STR is accurate. This is particularly true for identifiers such as names, ID numbers, registration numbers, etc. All spellings and transcriptions of identifiers should be double checked. A single inaccurate digit in a passport number or a NIC, or a misplaced or transposed character in a name, can make the difference between a successful or an unsuccessful analysis by the FIU. Identifiers for legal entities (e.g. company / business registration number, registered name of company) should be exactly identical in every respect to those found on any official registration documents.

Submission of Supporting Documents

26. DNFBs are required to submit relevant supporting documents along with the STR.

27. Supporting documents should support rather than replace the STR contents, including the narrative. It is not acceptable to only refer to a supporting document in the narrative when information from the supporting document can be directly included in the narrative. For example, if the suspicion involves a purchase of a real estate, all the details relating to purchase that are related to the suspicion should be included in the narrative.

28. An indicative but non-exhaustive list of supporting documents along with corresponding scenarios are given below for reference

Miscellaneous

Confidentiality

29. As per the Section 9 of the FTRA, DNFBs are prohibited from informing any person, including the customer, about the contents of an STR and even that the DNFB has filed or is contemplating filing such a STR to the FIU.

30. As per CDD Rules, where a DNFB forms a suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing risk relating to a customer and reasonably believes that conducting the process of CDD measures would tip off the customer, then the DNFB can proceed without conducting the CDD measures. However, the DNFB is required to immediately file a STR in compliance with Section 7 of the FTRA.

Breach of Confidentiality

31. If any customer is tipped off about the reporting of STRs by any officer of the DNFB it would be considered as a violation under the Section 9 and 10 of the FTRA. This is described as the offence of ‘tipping off’ and is an offense punishable with a fine not exceeding five hundred thousand rupees or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or both.

Protection for Persons Reporting STRs

32. As per Section 12 of the FTRA:

“No civil, criminal or disciplinary proceedings shall lie against —

(a) an Institution, an auditor or supervisory authority of an Institution; or

(b) a director, partner, an officer, employee or agent acting in the course of that person’s employment or agency of an Institution, firm of auditors or of a supervisory authority,

Part III

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2019

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

Part III - 63

in relation to any action by the Institution, the firm of auditors or the supervisory authority or a director, partner, officer, employee or agent of such Institution, firm or authority, carried out in terms of the FTRA in good faith or in compliance with regulations made under this Act or rules or directions given by the Financial Intelligence Unit in terms of the FTRA”.

33. Pursuant to Section 7 and 10 of the FTRA, all information in an STR, or additional information provided in support of the STR, including the identity of any officer or employee of a DNFB, will be treated in the strictest confidence by the FIU.

Failure to Report STRs

34. If a DNFB fails to submit STRs when reasonable grounds exist to suspect that a transaction is related to money laundering or terrorist financing, it is considered as non-compliance with the FTRA. As per Section 19 of the FTRA, who fails to conform with Section 7 of the FTRA, shall be liable to a penalty as may be prescribed taking into consideration the nature and gravity of relevant non-compliance: provided however such penalty shall not exceed a sum of rupees one million in any given case. Where a person who has been subjected to a penalty on a previous occasion, subsequently fails to conform to a requirement on any further occasion such person shall be liable to the payment of an additional penalty in a sum consisting of double the amount imposed as a penalty on the first occasion and for each non- compliance after such first occasion.

35. Further, in terms of Section 28 of the FTRA, a person who is making an STR under Section 7 makes any statement that the person knows is false or misleading in a material particular or omits from any statement any matter or thing without which the person knows that the statement is false or misleading in a material particular is guilty of an offence punishable on conviction to a fine not exceeding one hundred thousand rupees or imprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding one year, or to both such fine and imprisonment.

Should a reporting entity continue a business relationship with a customer about whom an STR has been reported?

36. The FTRA does not prohibit DNFBs from continuing business relationships with customers about whom STRs has been submitted or suspicion has been formed. Especially the behaviour of the DNFB towards the customer should not amount to any tipping off subject to the provisions of the Section 3 of the FTRA.

Obligations of DNFBs which have submitted an STR in relation to a customer and is continuing the business relationship

37. After the submission of an initial STR, the DNFB should continue to comply with all relevant provisions of the FTRA in all future dealings with that customer, which may include a requirement to submit additional STRs /information on further suspicions identified / further developments

Further Information Requests

38. Pursuant to Section 7 (3) of the FTRA, where the FIU has requested further information regarding any STR, the DNFBs should take all necessary measures to provide such information promptly to the FIU.

39. In addition, as specified in Section 15 (1) (b) of the FTRA, the DNFBs must submit any information that the FIU requests relevant to an act constituting an unlawful activity, or an offence of money laundering or financing of terrorism, or a terrorist activity whether or not publicly available, including commercially available databases, or information that is collected or maintained, including information that is stored, in databases maintained by the Government.

Appendix I

Suspicious Indicators

This appendix contains a list of indicators related to customer behaviours and activities. This list is necessarily non-exhaustive and incomplete and should be modified and supplemented as necessary by each DNFB. Indicators are not formulae and they do not always indicate the presence of criminality. Conversely, the lack of indicators does not mean the absence of criminality. However, the presence of an indicator, and especially the presence of multiple indicators, should cause increased scrutiny by the DNFB and such scrutiny may lead to the formation of suspicion.

Dear Sir/Madam,

Guidelines for Designated Non-Finance Businesses on Identification of Beneficial Ownership, No. 02 of 2019

The above mentioned guidelines will come into force with immediate effect and shall be read together with the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 6 of 2006 and the Designated Non-Finance Business (Customer Due Diligence) Rules, No. 1 of 2018.

Yours faithfully,

E H MohottyActg. Director/ Financial Intelligence

Cc: Compliance Officers

Guidelines for Designated Non-Finance Businesses on Identification of Beneficial

Ownership, No. 02 of 2019

Part I

Introduction

1. These Guidelines are issued pursuant to Section 15 (1) (j) of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act No, 6 of 2006 (hereinafter referred to as FTRA). The Financial Intelligence Unit (hereinafter referred to as FIU), acting within the powers vested with it under the FTRA, issued the Designated Non-Finance Business (Customer Due Diligence) Rules, No. 1 of 2018 (CDD Rules for DNFBs) by Gazette Extraordinary No. 2053/20, dated January 10, 2018, effective from the date of issue, applicable to institutions that engage in “non-finance business” (hereinafter referred to as DNFBs) as defined under Section 33 of the FTRA. Rules 10-13, 17-19 of the CDD Rules for DNFBs established, inter alia, provisions requiring DNFBs identified under the Rules to take appropriate measures to identify and verify the natural person(s) who are the ultimate “beneficial owners” of a customer that is a legal person or legal arrangement, as defined in Rule 43 of the CDD Rules for DNFBs.

2. The following businesses and professions are considered as DNFBs under the FTRA.

a) Casinos/gambling houses/conducting of a lottery, including a person who carries on such business through the internet.b) Real estate agents, when they are involved in transactions for their clients in relation to the buying and selling of real estate.c) Dealers in precious metals and dealers in precious and semi-precious stones.d) Lawyers, notaries, other independent legal professionals/accountants. e) Trusts or company service providers.

3. These Guidelines provide an aid for DNFBs to identify and verify the beneficial owner and apply the CDD Rules for DNFBs. These Guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive and do not impose legally binding practices on any DNFB, and do not

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

Part III - 69

constitute legal advice from the FIU. Nothing in these Guidelines should be interpreted as releasing DNFBs from any of their obligations under the CDD Rules for DNFBs or the FTRA.

Part II

A) Who is a Beneficial Owner?

4. The “beneficial owner” is a natural person who ultimately owns or controls customer or the person on whose behalf a transaction is being conducted including the person who exercises ultimate effective control over a legal person or a legal arrangement.

5. DNFBs conduct transactions or establish business relationships with individual customers as well as with corporate customers. Transactions with corporate customers can be any transaction conducted with a natural person, a “legal person” or a “legal arrangement”. “Legal person” means “an entity other than a natural person that is able to establish a permanent customer relationship with a non- finance business or otherwise owns property and includes a company, a body corporate, a foundation, a partnership or an association” whereas “legal arrangement” means “an express trust1, a fiduciary account or a nominee” (as defined in the CDD Rules for DNFBs).

6. It is a DNFB’s obligation to determine the natural person(s) who is/are the ultimate beneficial owner(s). The ultimate beneficial owner must be a natural person and cannot be a company, an organization or a legal arrangement. There may be more than one beneficial owner associated with a customer.

7. If the customer is a natural person, the person can be treated as the beneficial owner unless there are reasonable grounds to show that he is acting on behalf of another or if another person is the beneficial owner of the property of the customer. If the customer is acting on behalf of another person, the individual may not be the beneficial owner.

B) Why is it important to identify the Beneficial Owner?

8. Corporate entities such as companies, trusts, foundations, partnerships, and other types of legal persons and arrangements conduct a wide variety of commercial and entrepreneurial activities. However, despite the essential and legitimate role that corporate entities play in the economy, under certain conditions, they have been misused for illicit purposes, including money laundering (ML)2, bribery and corruption, insider dealings, tax fraud, terrorist financing (TF)3, and other unlawful activities. This is because, corporate entities provide an attractive avenue to disguise the ownership and hide the illicit origin for criminals who are trying to evade anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) measures.

9. Various studies conducted by Financial Action Task Force (FATF), World Bank, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) have explored the misuse of corporate entities for illicit purposes, including for ML/TF. In general, the lack of adequate, accurate and timely beneficial ownership information facilitates ML/TF by disguising:

a) the identity of known or suspected criminals, b) the true purpose of a transaction executed by a corporate entity, and/or c) the source or use of funds associated with a corporate entity.

Part III

Establishing the Beneficial Owner

A) Person on whose behalf a transaction is being conducted

10. Another aspect of the definition of beneficial ownership is a person on whose behalf a transaction is conducted. This may be the individual who is an underlying client of the customer. An example is, if a DNFB knows that person ‘A’ is conducting an occasional transaction on behalf of person ‘B’, and then person ‘A’ and person ‘B’ should be identified and verified along with any other beneficial owners that may be a party to the transaction.

11. Acting on behalf of the customer means when a person is authorized to carry out transactions or other activities on behalf of the customer. However, ‘Authority to act’ should not be confused with ‘Effective control’. There are instances where persons are acting on behalf of a customer may not necessarily be the beneficial owners of that customer.

12. DNFBs have to identify the natural persons that act on behalf of the customer and verify the identity of such persons4. The authority of such person to act on behalf of the customer also should be verified through documentary evidence including specimen signatures of the persons so authorized.

1. In terms of Section 03 of the Trust Ordinance No. 07 0f 1917 as amended by Section 2 of the Trusts (Amendment) Act No. 6 of 2018 (“Trusts Amendment Act”), an ‘express trust’ is defined as a trust that is created by the author of the trust generally in the form of an instrument in writing with certainty indicating the intention of the trust, but does not include a constructive or a de facto trust, whether charitable or not.2. “Money Laundering” (ML) means the offence of money laundering in terms of section 3 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, No 5 of 20063. “Terrorist Financing” means an act constituting an offence under section 3 of the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act, No. 25 of 2005..4. Please refer Rule No. 11 of the CDD Rules for DNFBs

B) Elements of identifying the Beneficial Owners of Legal Persons

13. DNFBs should consider following three main elements in the process of identifying Beneficial Owners of a legal person:

a) Which natural person(s) owns or controls more than ten percent (10%) of the legal person’s equity? (Controlling

Ownership)b) Which natural person(s) has “effective control” of the legal person? (Effective Control)c) On behalf of which natural person(s) the transaction is being conducted? (Person on whose behalf a transaction is being conducted)

i) Element I – Controlling Ownership

14. DNFBs are required to understand the ownership and control structure of their customers which are legal persons5. Controlling ownership interest is defined as “an interest acquired by providing more than ten per cent of the capital of a legal person”. Accordingly, under this element, DNFBs are required to identify shareholders of the legal person having more than 10% of shares as the beneficial owners of the legal person. The prescribed threshold for controlling interest is interpreted as owning more than ten percent (10%) of the customer that is a legal person6 . The ownership could be direct as well as indirect through aggregated ownership as illustrated below.

Figure 1: Direct Shareholding

‘Company A’ is a customer of a DNFB that is a legal person. Mr. A, Mr. B, Mr. C, Mr. D and Mr. E are direct shareholders of the ‘Company A’ whereas Mr. B, Mr. C and Mr. D are the beneficial owners having more than 10% of the ownership.

Company A(Customer of a DNFB)

Mr. A 5%Mr. B 10%Mr. C 35%Mr. D 42%Mr. E 8%

15. In addition, there can be indirect ownership structures as follows.

Figure 2: Indirect Shareholding

‘Company A’ is a customer of a DNFB that is a legal person. ‘A Holdings Ltd’ holds 100% of the shares of ‘Company A’ and Mr. B, Mr. C, Mr. D, Mr. E, Mr. F and Mr. G are the shareholders of the ‘A Holdings Ltd’.

16. Some businesses maintain complex structures of ownership which would make it difficult to understand the ultimate beneficial owners.

Figure 3: Direct and Indirect Shareholding

Company B’ is a customer of a DNFB that is a legal person. ‘Company C’ holds 95% of the shares of ‘Company B’ and Mr. A holds the rest 5%. On the other hand, Mr. A holds the 100% of the shares of ‘Company C’.

‘Company ABC’ is a customer of a DNFB that is a legal person. Both ‘Company PQR’ and ‘Company XYZ’ holds 50% of the shares of ‘Company ABC’. Shares of the ‘Company PQR’ are respectively held by Mr. D (10%), ‘Company LMN’ (60%), ‘Company STR’ (5%) and ‘Company IOD’ (25%). However, Mr. Z holds 100% of the shares of ‘Company LMN’, Mr. Y holds 100% of the shares of ‘Company STR’ and Mr. X holds 100% of the shares of ‘Company IOD’. Further, the 100% of the shares of ‘Company XYZ’ is held by Mr. F.

17. For some customers that are legal persons, ownership may be spread over a large number of individuals with all individuals owning less than ten percent (10%). In such instance, because no individual(s) owns more than ten percent (10%), the effective control element outlined below would be more appropriate to determine the beneficial owner(s)/controller(s).

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2019

Part III

Part III - 72

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

ii) Element II: Effective Control

18. Effective control of a legal person is another important component that determines the beneficial ownership. Such control can be direct or indirect, formal or informal. At a direct and formal level, it is essential to understand a legal person’s governance structure to identify the natural persons that exercise effective control over the legal person. In deciding the effective controller(s) in relation to a customer that is a legal person, DNFBs should consider,

a) a natural person who can hire or terminate a member of senior level management;b) a natural person who can appoint or dismiss Directors;c) Senior managers who have control over daily/regular operations of the legal person/arrangement (e.g. a CEO, CFO or a Managing Director).

19. Natural persons may also control the legal person through other means such as:

a) Personal connections to persons in positions such as an Executive Director/CEO/ Managing Director or that possess ownership;b) Significant authority over a legal person’s financial relationships (including with financial institutions that hold accounts on behalf of a legal person) and the ongoing financial affairs of the legal person; c) Control without ownership by participating in the financing of the enterprise, or because of close family relationships, historical or contractual associations; d) Use, enjoyment or benefiting from the assets owned by the legal person even if control is never exercised.

Mr. B, Mr. D, Mr. E and Mr. F and Mr. G are beneficial owners of ‘Company A’.

Mr. G is the Managing Director of the ‘ABC Bank’, which is the main financing source of the ‘Company A’ (the customer of DNFB that is a legal person). In such a situation even if Mr. G holds less than ten percent (10%) of ‘Company A’, he has effective control over the ‘Company A’ through ABC Bank and should be considered as a beneficial owner through effective control.

20. Where no natural person is identified under (13-17) above, DNFBs should identify and take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the relevant natural person who holds the position of senior managing officials.

C) Identifying Beneficial Owner of Legal Arrangements

21. All trusts have the common characteristic of causing a separation between legal ownership and beneficial ownership. Legal ownership always rests with the trustee. Beneficial ownership can rest with the author of trust, trustees or beneficiaries, jointly or individually.

22. The DNFBs should identify and take reasonable measures to verify information about a trust, including, the identities of the author of the trust, the trustees, the beneficiary or class of beneficiaries, and protector, where applicable, and any other natural person exercising ultimate effective control over the trust (including those who control through the chain of control or ownership)7.

7. Please refer Rule No. 19 of the CDD Rules for DNFBs.

Part III - 73

23. DNFBs are required to obtain trust documents (e.g. deed of trust, instrument of trust, trust declaration, etc.) and the provisions of the trust document must be fully understood within the context of the laws of the governing jurisdiction. The DNFBs should take reasonable measures to verify trust document through independent means (e.g. Registry of Trust, Notary).

Part IV

Ways in which Beneficial Ownership information can be hidden

24. Beneficial ownership information can be concealed through various ways, including but not limited to;

a) use of shell companies8 (which can be established with various forms of ownership structures). Especially if the shell companies are involved in foreign ownerships, the impact will spread across jurisdictions,

b) complex ownership and control structures involve many layers of ownership. Sometimes, it can be in the name of another legal person and sometimes it may use a chain of ownership that is spread across several jurisdictions,

c) purchase of properties under the names of third parties where no relationship can be found,

d) use of legal persons as directors,

e) formal nominee shareholders9 and directors where the identity of the person who nominates such shareholders or directors is hidden,

f) informal nominee shareholders and directors, such as close associates and family,

g) trust and other legal arrangements, which enable a separation of legal ownership and beneficial ownership of assets, and

h) use of intermediaries in forming legal persons, including professional intermediaries such as accountants, lawyers, notaries, trust and company service providers.

Case Study on Identifying Beneficial Owners of a Legal Person

ABC Company Ltd is a private limited liability company registered under the Companies Act, No. 7 of 2007. ABC Company Ltd comes to a Real Estate Agent to buy a land plot.

Mr. A owns 30% of the shares of ABC Company Ltd and XYZ Company Ltd holds the balance 70% of shares of ABC Company. Further, Mr. S is the Managing Director of ABC Company and the Board of Directors are his wife, Mrs. S and their three children.

In this example the Real Estate Agent is required to identify the following in relation to ABC Company Ltd as required by Rule 17 of the CDD Rules for DNFBs:

1. Understand the nature of the customer’s business, its ownership and control structure.

• the ownership of the ABC Company Ltd - shared by Mr. A (30% of the shares) and XYZ Company Ltd (70% of the shares);

• the ownership structure of the entity - ABC Company Ltd is a business owned by family members and traded privately;

2. Identify the customer and verify its identity as required by Rule 17 (b) of the CDD Rules for DNFBs.

• the identification of all members of the Board of Directors (Mr. S’s Family) as they are having effective control;

3. Identify and verify the identity of beneficial owners as required by Rule 18 of the CDD Rules for DNFBs.

• identification and verification of identity of Mr. A as he is having more than 10% of ownership;

• identification of all of the individuals who own or control, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the shares of XYZ Company Ltd since it owns 70% of the shares, it also exercises control;

• however, in a case like this, Real Estate Agent must research further to determine whether any individual owns enough shares of XYZ Company Ltd that would constitute 10% of ABC Company Ltd, or until Real Estate Agent determines that there is no such individual;

• the manner in which DNFBs obtained this information; and

• the measures taken to verify accuracy of information.

Part V

What should you do to Identify and Verify Beneficial Ownership Information?

25. DNFBs identify and take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the beneficial owner(s) of the customers that are legal persons and legal arrangements.

8. Shell companies are companies that are incorporated with no significant operations or related assets, including an absence of physical presence.9. A nominee shareholder refers to a company member holding the shares on behalf of the actual owner or beneficial owner. He/she is the registered owner of the share. A nominee shareholder holds the share under a custodial agreement.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2019

Part III

Part III - 74

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

26. Accordingly, the identification of beneficial owner is mandatory. Once the DNFBs establishes who the beneficial owner(s) of a customer is/are, the DNFBs must collect at least the following information in relation to each individual beneficial owner,

a) the full name;b) permanent residential or mailing address;c) occupation, name of employer, business or principal activity;d) an official personal identification number or any other identification document that bears a photograph of the customer or beneficial owner such as the National Identity Card, passport or driving license;e) date of birth;f) nationality;g) source of funds;h) purpose of transaction;i) telephone numbers (residence, office or mobile).

27. DNFBs are also required to take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the beneficial owner before or during the course of entering into a business relationship with, or conducting a transaction for an occasional customer10 by requiring the customer to furnish the original document and making a copy of the said document.

28. The reasonable measures for verification should be taken subject to the risk and complexities of the ownership and control structure of the legal person or arrangement.

Part VI

A) Beneficial owners who are Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs)

29. DNFBs are required to implement appropriate internal policies, procedures and controls to determine if the beneficial owner is a Politically Exposed Person11. Through such processes, if the DNFB identifies any beneficial owner as a PEP, the relationship should be subject to enhanced due diligence as required in the CDD Rules for DNFBs.

B) Record keeping obligations

30. The DNFBs are required to maintain records of identification and verification information relating to beneficial ownership as prescribed under CDD Rules for DNFBs12 and FTRA.

C) Reporting Obligations

31. When a DNFB is unable to comply with CDD measures as required in CDD Rules for DNFBs including identification and verification of beneficial ownership information, and/or CDD measures would tip off the customer, it shall immediately file a Suspicious Transaction Report in compliance with Section 7 of the FTRA13.

D) Sanctions

32. Failure to comply with the beneficial ownership requirements as required under the CDD Rules for DNFBs will be a violation of Section 2 (3) of the FTRA and will be punishable under Section 19 of the FTRA.

Guidelines on Identification of Politically Exposed Persons, No. 03 of 2019

A. Introduction

1. These Guidelines are issued pursuant to section 15(1) (j) of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 06 of 2006 (FTRA).

2. These Guidelines are issued to the Institutions defined under Section 33 of the FTRA for the purpose of determining whether a customer or the beneficial owner is a Politically Exposed Person (herein after referred as PEPs).

3. Further, these guidelines should be read along with the Financial Institutions (Customer Due Diligence) Rules, No. 01 of 2016 by Gazette Extraordinary No. 1951/13, dated January 27, 2016, and Designated Non- Finance Business (Customer Due Diligence) Rules, No. 1 of 2018 by Gazette Extraordinary No. 2053/20, dated January 10, 2018. These Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Rules are hereinafter referred to as FIs CDD Rules and DNFBs CDD Rules respectively.

4. Rule 59 of the FIs CDD Rules and Rule 24 of the DNFBs CDD Rules establishes the procedure to be followed by the FIs and DNFBs in dealing with customers /beneficial owners who are Politically Exposed Persons, or their immediate family members and closed associates.

5. These Guidelines are provided as an aid to interpret and apply CDD Rules. These Guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive and cannot be considered as legal advice from the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). Nothing in these Guidelines should be construed as releasing FIs or DNFBs from any of their obligations under the CDD Rules or the FTRA.

B. Background/ Context

Who is a Politically Exposed Person (PEP)?

6. Rule 99 of the FIs CDD Rules and Rule 43 of the DNFBs CDD Rules define PEPs, their immediate family members and close associates.

7. As per these CDD Rules, “politically exposed person” means an individual who is entrusted with prominent public functions either domestically or by a foreign country, or in an international organization and includes a head of a State or a Government, a politician, a senior government officer, judicial officer or military officer, a senior executive of a State Owned Corporation/Government or Autonomous body but does not include middle ranking or junior ranking individuals. The CDD Rule is also applicable to family members and close associates of a PEP as well.

8. Accordingly, PEPs can be identified under following categories

a) Domestic PEPs: individuals who are entrusted with prominent public functions in Sri Lanka.

b) Foreign PEPs: individuals who are entrusted with prominent public functions by a foreign country.

c) International organization PEPs: persons who are entrusted with a prominent function by an international organization.

d) Immediate Family members: individuals who are related to a PEP either directly (on grounds of consanguinity) or through marriage or similar (civil) forms of partnership.

e) Close associates: individuals who are closely connected to PEP, either socially or professionally.

9. Immediate family members of PEPs include any of the following relations:

i. spouse (current and past);

ii. siblings, (including half-siblings) and their spouses;

iii. children (including step-children and adopted children) and their spouses;

iv. parents (including step-parents);

v. grand children and their spouses.

10. Close associates of PEPs or their family members includes;

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2019

Part III

Part III - 76

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

i. a natural person having joint beneficial ownership of legal entities and legal arrangements, or any other close business relationship with any person identified in guidelines 7 or 9 above; and

ii. a legal person or legal arrangement whose beneficial owner is a natural person and is known to have been set up for the benefit of such person or his immediate family members identified in guidelines 7 and 9;

iii. a PEP’s widely- and publicly-known close business colleagues or personal advisors, in particular, persons acting in a financial fiduciary capacity.

11. For the purposes of the PEP definition, “international organizations” are organizations established by formal political agreements between its member countries, where such agreement has the status of an international treaty, and the organization is recognized in the law of the member countries. The examples of international organizations provided by FATF include:

a) the United Nations and its affiliates such as the International Maritime Organization;

b) regional international organizations;

c) international military organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization;

d) economic organizations such as the World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, Asian Development Bank, etc.

12. CDD Rules require FIs/ DNFBs to establish specific procedures in relation to PEPs as well as their immediate family members and close associates.

C. Money Laundering, Terrorism Financing and Proliferation Financing Risks Associated with PEPs

13. Due to their official status or position held and influence, it is recognized that many PEPs are in positions that potentially can be abused for money laundering and related predicate offences, including bribery and corruption, as well as activity related to terrorism financing. The potential risks associated with PEPs justify the application of additional Anti Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) measures to prevent, detect and manage these risks emanating from their conduct.

14. However, it should be noted that if a person is a PEP, this does not mean that there is an automatic link to criminal activities or abuse of the financial system. The additional AML/CFT measures applied in the case of PEPs are preventative, and should not be interpreted as stigmatizing PEPs as being involved in criminal activity; rather these measures recognize the increased risk, including opportunity, associated with holding this type of role.

D. Identification of PEPs

15. Every FI/ DNFB is required to implement appropriate internal policies, procedures and controls to determine if the customer or the beneficial owner is a politically exposed person. This is applicable for all new and ongoing business relationships with customers.

16. The ability to determine if customers or beneficial owner is a PEP fully depends upon the effective implementation of CDD measures, including the identification, verification, and ongoing due diligence requirements as set out in the CDD Rules. CDD measures are the indispensable starting point as these should be applied to any type of customer. Key factors in the CDD process such as principal occupation or employment would be a good starting point in such determination.

17. The PEP definition specifically excludes identifying middle ranking or junior individuals as PEPs. However, there should be awareness that middle ranking and junior officials could act on behalf of a PEP to circumvent AML/CFT controls. These less prominent public functions could be appropriately taken into account as customer risk factors in the framework of the overall assessment of risks associated with the business relationship in accordance with CDD Rules when they are acting on behalf of a PEP.

18. FIs/ DNFBs doing business with a foreign PEP may not have had much first-hand knowledge or direct access to information about variables such as what a reasonable income would be for a foreign public official at a particular level or in a particular position. Consequently, appropriate risk management systems need to be implemented to address these particular risks both at the account opening/CDD stage, and when existing foreign customers become PEPs.

19. In case the customer is determined to be a domestic/international organization PEP, then FIs/DNFBs should gather sufficient information to understand the particular characteristics of the public functions that the PEP has been entrusted with and, in the case of an international organization, the business model of that organization. Information on international organizations, for example, may be found on their respective website.

Part III - 77

20. FIs/ DNFBs may refer to the non-exhaustive list at Annex A as examples of types of customers, whether domestic or foreign or in relation to international organizations and with political exposure. However, FIs/DNFBPs are required to identify any individual who falls within the definition of PEP even though such person/designation is not listed within the Annex A.

E. Beneficial owners

21. When conducting CDD, FIs/ DNFBs are required to identify the beneficial owners and take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the beneficial owners. This should include legal persons and arrangements whose ultimate beneficial owners or controllers are PEPs or their family members or associates.

22. If there are reasonable grounds to believe that a beneficial owner is a PEP, a FIs/DNFBs entity required to verify if the beneficial owner is a PEP.

23. FIs/DNFBs are required to inquire the reason for a person purporting to act on behalf of a beneficial owner in order to determine whether the beneficial owner of the customer or client is a PEP.

24. FIs/DNFBs required to apply all the requirements applicable to a PEP for:

a) a person who is acting on behalf of a PEP, or

b) a customer or beneficial owner of a customer who is identified as a family member or close associate of a PEP.

F. Methods used in PEP identification

25. There is no single method of identifying PEPs, their family members, or close associates. Whereas PEPs and family members can be identified using objective criteria, criteria for close associates are sometimes (but not always) relatively more subjective. It is highly unlikely that any single method of identification will be adequate. Instead a combination of methods will yield the best results. Some of those methods include:

a. Screening of customer and beneficial owner identifiers using commercial databases compiled for this purpose. These databases are populated from public sources of information and, accordingly may not be complete or up-to-date.

b. Screening of customer and beneficial owner identifiers using an internally maintained database of PEPs, family members, and close associates.

c. Screening against publicly available registries of people with financial declaration /disclosure requirements in their home country in case of foreign PEPs.

d. Conducting and utilizing ad-hoc customer research. This involves researching customers using available tools such as search engines, social media, company registries, company websites, news websites, trade websites, government websites, commercial information aggregators, in-person interviews, etc.

e. Self- declaration obtained from a customer - FIs/DNFBs can obtain information from customers on their PEP status as a part of the CDD process However, FIs/DNFBs who confirm customer’s PEP status through a self-declaration should ensure that they do not rely solely on such self-declarations as customers may not be able to determine if they are indeed a PEP. Institutions are advised to actively engage with customers and elicit information pertinent to the different elements of the PEP definition if they deploy self-declaration.

G. Review/Update of Customer Status

26. Existing customers may become PEPs after they enter a business relationship, therefore, it is essential that FIs /DNFBs monitor non-PEP accounts for a change in the customer status/profile or account activity and update customer information accordingly. Such monitoring is required to be based on risk, consistent with the requirements under the CDD Rules. Following are some instances where institutions are required to update its customer status relating to PEPs.

a. when a customer spontaneously submits a new declaration of political exposure;

b. when ongoing monitoring reveals activities or information that deviate significantly from the customer and/or account profile in a manner that suggests previously unknown political exposure;

c. when an election is held that affects any of the customer’s PEP status;

d. whenever the FIs/DNFBs becomes aware, through any means, of the need for such an update.

27. Existing PEP customer relationships should be subject to periodic review to ensure that due diligence information remains current and the associated controls remain appropriate.

H. Managing PEP Risks

28. FIs/DNFBs are required to conduct enhanced due diligence of the business relationships of any customer identified as a PEP.

29. Once identified, PEPs, their family members, and close associates always represent additional risk that requires appropriate management. The precise nature and magnitude of that risk and commensurate risk mitigations, however, may vary widely. Factors that affect risk relating to PEPs may include:

a. the perceptions of corruption and financial transparency in the PEP’s country of citizenship;b. the nature of the political exposure;c. the nature of the relationship with the PEP, in the case of family members and close associates ;d. the elapsed time since the PEP held the position(s) that qualified him to be a PEP;e. the nature of the claimed sources of funds and the ability to fully and confidently verify those sources and their legitimacy;f. has business interests, which are related to his/her public functions (conflict of interest);g. involved in public procurement processes; where the PEP holds several (related or unrelated) prominent public functions that may enable influence to be exerted at several key decision making points in a process, especially relating to payments;h. holds a prominent public function in sectors known to be exposed to corruption; ori. holds a prominent public function that would allow him/her to exert a negative impact on the effective implementation of the AML/CFT framework in the country.

30. FIs /DNFBs are required to apply following measures relating to PEPs as per the CDD Rules;

a. Obtain approval from the institution’s board of directors/ senior management prior to entering in to a new business relationship or continuing an existing relationship;

b. Identify the source of funds and wealth by appropriate means;

c. Enhanced ongoing monitoring of the business relationship is performed.

I. Establishment of the Source of Wealth and Source of Funds of the PEP

31. FIs/DNFBs are required to take reasonable measures to establish the source of wealth and the source of funds of PEPs, as required in the CDD Rules.

32. “Wealth” and “funds” are two different concepts. The source of wealth refers to the origin of the PEP’s entire body of wealth (i.e., total assets). This information will usually give an indication as to the volume of wealth the customer would be expected to have, and a picture of how the PEP acquired such wealth. Although FIs/DNFBs may not have specific information about assets not deposited or processed by them, it may be possible to gather general information from commercial databases or other open sources.

33. The source of funds refers to the origin of the particular funds or other assets that are the subject of the business relationship between the PEP and the FIs/DNFBs (e.g., the amounts being invested, deposited, or transferred/wired as part of the business relationship). Normally, it will be easier to obtain this information but it should not simply be limited to knowing from which institution it may have been transferred/wired. The information obtained should be substantive and establish a source or reason for having been acquired.

34. Information about the source of wealth and source of funds is useful for ongoing due diligence purposes. When conducting ongoing due diligence of the business relationship, it is important for FIs/DNFBs to ensure that the level and type of transactions are consistent with the institution’s knowledge of the PEP’s source of wealth and source of funds. The aim is to ensure that the reason for the business relationship is commensurate with what one could reasonably expect from the PEP, given his/her particular circumstances.

35. Where the level or type of activity in the business relationship is different from what can be reasonably explained, given the knowledge of a PEP’s sources of funds and sources of wealth, an entity should undertake a further assessment on the business relationship to establish whether to:

a. continue with or terminate the business relationship; or

b. file a suspicious transaction report to the FIU.

J. Time Limits of PEP Status

36. The handling of a customer who is no longer entrusted with a prominent public function should be based on an assessment of risk and not on any predetermined time limits.

Part III

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2019

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

Part III - 79

37. Such risk-based approach requires that FIs/ DNFBs assess the ML/TF risks of a PEP who is no longer entrusted with a prominent public function, and take effective action to mitigate this risk. Possible risk factors are:

a. the level of (informal) influence that the individual could still exercise; the seniority of the position that the individual held as a PEP; or

b. whether the individual’s previous and current function are linked in any way (e.g., formally by appointment of the PEPs successor, or informally by the fact that the PEP continues to deal with the same substantive matters).

38. PEPs are not immune from the application of the requirements under the CDD Rule or from being the subject of the obligation to report suspicious transactions under Section 7 of the FTRA.

K. PEPs Red Flags / Indicators

39. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has developed a collection of red flags / indicators (Annex B) that can be used to assist in the detection of misuse of the financial systems by PEPs during a customer relationship. This list of red flags / indicators is relevant to detect those PEPs that abuse the financial system, and does not intend to stigmatize all PEPs. Often, matching one or more of these red flags / indicators may only raise the risk of doing business with a customer (red flags, risk factors), and several red flags may need to be met to create a suspicion. However, in some cases and depending on the specific circumstances, matching just one or more of these red flags / indicators will directly lead to a ML suspicion (indicators of suspicion).

40. These PEP red flags are not an exhaustive list and are complementary to the usual ML red flags that a reporting entity may be using. The methods of those PEPs that engage in illicit activity change and therefore indicators of their activity will do so as well. Also, there may be other red flags that should be considered as equally important in a particular country or region.

L. Board of Directors/ Senior Management

41. Consistent with the requirement for FIs/DNFBs to obtain senior management approval for establishing or continuing a business relationship with PEP, a FIs/DNFBs should determine what constitutes senior management within the FIs/DNFBs.

42. What would constitute as senior management should depend on the size, structure, and nature of the entity involved.

43. FIs/DNFBs should ensure that senior management are aware of relationships with PEPs and in no circumstances the FIs/DNFBs undertake business relationships with PEPs in the absence of adequate controls by senior management.

44. In assessing whether FIs/DNFBs should undertake a business relationship with a PEP, senior management involved shall:

a. have full knowledge and understanding of the FI/DNFB’s AML or CFT internal control programs;

b. have a strong understanding of the potential or existing client’s or customer’s ML or TF risk profile; and

c. have active involvement in the approval process of the entity’s AML or CFT policies and procedures.

45. Without limiting the determination or otherwise of FIs/DNFBs assessing what constitutes senior management, an entity may establish monitoring committees, or comparable decision-making structures that:

a. review establishment of business relationships with PEPs at the acceptance stage and on an on-going basis;

b. ensure that all relevant internal information is carefully considered in specific cases;

c. manage the termination of a business relationship with a PEP in appropriate circumstances; and

d. ensure that appropriate information, which include internal policies, procedures, and controls regarding PEPs, is available within the reporting entity when and where necessary.

M. Record Keeping Obligations

46. The FIs/DNFBs are required to maintain records of identification and verification information relating to PEPs as prescribed under Part V and Part III of the FIs and DNFBPs CDD Rules respectively and FTRA.

N. Internal control policies-training and group-wide policies

47. FIs/DNFBs should establish and maintain internal control policies that include ongoing employee training programs.

48. The training programs, which should be regularly updated, shall be designed to address effective ways of determining whether a client or customer is a PEP and to understand, assess and handle the potential risks associated with PEPs.

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

49. FIs/DNFBPs that are part of a financial group should establish and maintain group-wide internal controls, policies and

procedures.

O. Information Sharing

50. FIs/DNFBPs that are part of financial groups may share information amongst themselves on PEPs for AML/CFT purposes,

provided that there are adequate safeguards on the confidentiality and use of information exchanged.

Dear Sir/Madam,

Debiting Withholding Taxes from Suspended Accounts

The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is empowered by Section 15(2) of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. 6 of 2006 (FTRA), to direct financial institutions not to proceed with any transaction or transactions for a period of seven days. Further, in terms of Section 15(3) of the FTRA, the High Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo may subsequently extend such suspension for a further period.

In terms of Sections 84 and 86 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 24 of 2017 (IRA) withholding taxes should be deducted at the time of interest paid to the account holder and should be paid to the Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue within 15 days after the end of each calendar month. Section 179 of the IRA empowers the Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue to impose penalties in an event of non-payment of the due amount within the stipulated time period.

All financial institutions are hereby directed to deduct withholding taxes before crediting the interest to the suspended accounts and credit only the net interest (withholding taxes deducted from interest) to such accounts. Further, you are requested to pay the withholding taxes related to interest of suspended accounts to the IRD as specified in the IRA.

This circular will come into effect immediately and shall be applicable from the next immediate cycle of the interest payment.

Yours faithfully,

Director Financial Intelligence Unit Cc: Compliance Officers of All Licensed Banks and Licensed Finance Companies

Local Payments

This Circular is issued in terms of Section 44 of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act No.28 of 2005 (Act) read with Section 4 of the Act to establish a National Quick Response Code Standard for Local Payments. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) hereby issues a National QR code standard; titled LANKAQR Specifications (Annexure 1).

This Circular shall replace the Payment and Settlement Systems Circular No. 06 of 2018 – Establishment of a National Quick Response Code Standard for Local Currency Payments and shall come into effect on 11 March 2019 and all Financial Institutions (Licensed Banks and Licensed Finance Companies), and Licensed Operators of Mobile Phone Based e-Money Systems who offer QR Code based payment solutions shall conform to the same within two (02) months of this Circular.

1. Definitions

For all intents and purposes the following have been defined as parties to a LANKAQR code initiated transaction:

Administrative Measures Adopted by the Government and the Monetary Board during the Year

1.3 Network Facilitator - When the Issuer and acquirer (Merchant Acquirer and Transaction Acquirer) are different, the Network Facilitator would be responsible for routing transactions between the respective Financial Institutions involved in the transaction. Processing and clearing of all payments acquired using LANKAQR code, which are effected through current accounts, savings accounts and Mobile Phone Based e-Money accounts will be routed through the LankaClear (Pvt) Ltd (LCPL) network. It must be noted that LANKAQR based payments effected through international payment networks will be processed and cleared through existing mechanisms.

1.4 Mobile Application Provider - This is the party which provides the mobile based payment solution to facilitate transactions using LANKAQR code. This can be a third-party application provider of a Financial Institution or an acquiring institution.

1.5 Transaction Acquirer - The Transaction Acquirer is the Financial Institution which provides acquiring facilities for the mobile application provider or Mobile Phone Based e-Money Operator to process LANKAQR transactions. This party would facilitate the financial transactions via respective payment network.

2. Fees and Charges

2.1 No charge shall be levied on the customer for LANKAQR code initiated transactions.

2.2 Charges may be levied on merchants in the form of a Merchant Discount Rate (MDR).

2.3 Merchant Acquirers are strictly advised to make sure that the merchants do not recover full/part cost of MDR from the end customer.

2.4 Merchant Acquirers shall ensure that the lowest possible MDR rates prevail in order to encourage faster and widespread adoption of the LANKAQR code in the country.

2.5 Initially, CBSL may allow market forces to determine the MDR thus creating a healthy competition among Merchant Acquirers, and if required, CBSL may intervene in order to regularise and stabilise the MDR.

2.6 Table 1 below is an example of the distribution of a 1% MDR between all stakeholders – Merchant Acquirers, Transaction Acquirers, Issuers and LCPL. Though the MDR may vary, the allocation for each stakeholder identified below shall not be changed, with the exception of the Merchant Acquirer. The Issuer Fee and Transaction Acquirer Fee shall be distributed by LCPL, in accordance with the allocations provided in Table 1 of this Circular. The LCPL Fee payment by the Merchant Acquirer will be added to the existing LankaPay – CEFTS monthly invoice.

2.7 In the instance of a reversal of a transaction, the network fee (LCPL Fee which is non-refundable) shall be borne by the Merchant Acquirer.
