2 As  per  some  classifications,  Sri  Lanka  is  caught  in  a  so-called  middle  income  trap.

Economists use this term to represent a scenario where countries that move with speed 
into middle income levels failing to continue such growth momentum so as to reach high 
income  levels.  The  definition  of  middle  income  trap  is  not  consistent  among  different
