1.1 OverviewD

uring the year 2019, Sri Lanka’s dismal

performance continued in terms of real

economic growth, although macroeconomic

stabilisation measures helped correct the external

sector imbalances to some extent, while inflation

pressures remained muted on average. The Easter

Sunday attacks had a severe impact on the tourism

sector, and their adverse spillover effects were felt

across the economy, worsening the sluggish growth

of the economy and further dampening business

confidence. Policy measures aimed at reducing

pressures on the balance of payments (BOP) and

the exchange rate continued in 2019, which together

with steps taken to revive the economy, contributed

to notable slippages in the fiscal sector. Subdued

demand conditions allowed the continuation of low

inflation during the year, although extreme weather

conditions and resultant disruptions to domestic

food supplies caused some volatility in consumer

prices. Growth of credit to the private sector

decelerated sharply, driven by subdued economic

activity and weak business confidence, affecting

the performance of the financial sector. Considering

the need to support economic activity amidst muted

inflation, well anchored inflation expectations

and diminished pressures in the external sector,

the Central Bank adopted an accommodative

monetary policy stance, and took steps to expedite

the transmission of monetary policy measures to

the economy through regulatory action aimed at

reducing market interest rates.

As domestic economic activity started to show

early responses to the policy measures taken to revive

the economy and improving business sentiments at

the beginning of the year 2020, the outbreak of the

COVID-19 pandemic, the containment measures

adopted by all countries including Sri Lanka, and

the resultant projected contraction in the global

economy, triggered further uncertainties regarding

the country’s economic performance in 2020. In

the near term, the economy is likely to be impacted

severely in terms of its growth, fiscal, external,

and financial sector performance, while causing

hardships to all stakeholders of the economy. The

monetary policy space in terms of the low inflation

environment, and the banking sector space created

by the maintenance of capital and liquidity buffers

above industry norms, enabled the Central Bank to

support the efforts of the government to ease the

burden on businesses as well as individuals. Despite

the temporary setback posed by the pandemic,

appropriate growth supportive reforms to address

longstanding structural issues and enhance

domestic production, improve export orientation,

attract foreign direct investment (FDI), facilitate

innovation, improve factor productivity and efficiency,

and improve policy buffers, if implemented without

delay, would enable Sri Lanka to realise the desired

outcome of achieving sustained and equitable

economic growth and becoming a prosperous nation

in the period ahead.

1.2 Macroeconomic Developments in 2019

Real Sector Developments and Inflation

Sri Lanka graduated to the upper middle

income country status in terms of per capita

Gross National Income (GNI), as per the World

Bank’s country classification in 2019. The

value of the country’s Gross Domestic Product

(GDP) at current market prices was US dollars

84.0 billion in 2019, compared to US dollars 88.4

billion in 2018. Per capita GDP and per capita GNI

at current market prices were estimated at US

dollars 3,852 and US dollars 3,741, respectively,

in 2019, in comparison to US dollars 4,079 and US

dollars 3,968, respectively, in the previous year.

Subdued economic growth, coupled with the sharp

depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee towards end

2018, which resulted in a substantially depreciated

average exchange rate in 2019, caused the decline

in these indicators in 2019 from the levels observed

in the previous year.

The Sri Lankan economy recorded a

subdued growth of 2.3 per cent in 2019,

compared to the growth of 3.3 per cent in

2018, as per the provisional estimates of GDP

of the Department of Census and Statistics

(DCS). All major sectors of the economy recorded

Sri Lanka graduated to the upper middle income country status as per the World Bank classification of countries published in July 2019. The World Bank classifies countries based on per capita Gross National Income (GNI) into income categories of low income, lower middle income, upper middle income and high income1 (Figure B 1.1). As per this classification, Sri Lanka transitioned from the low income country status to the lower middle income country status in 1997. Since then, the country has progressed through challenging periods, including the catastrophic Tsunami disaster in 2004, the escalation of the civil conflict until its end in 2009, periods of extreme weather conditions and related natural disasters, and socio-economic and political changes. Despite the adverse impacts of such disturbances on the macroeconomy, the country recorded above five per cent GDP growth on average since the graduation to a lower middle income country, and reached the upper middle income level. However, Sri Lanka took 21 years to graduate from the lower middle income category to the next level, thereby spending a relatively long period compared to some other emerging market economies. In this context, it is essential that Sri Lanka introduces the necessary structural reforms in a timely manner in order to ensure that a strong growth momentum is sustained in the period ahead, and thereby to avoid possible stagnation in the middle income levels for a longer period, i.e., the middle income trap.2 Table B 1.1 exhibits the time taken by selected countries to move from the upper middle income level to high income level, which ranges between 7 – 40 years.3 Although there is a lack of consensus as to why countries get trapped in middle income levels, literature points to the slowdown in productivity as the major contributory factor caused by lack of economic diversification, rigid and inefficient labour markets, lack of access to advanced infrastructure, weak institutions, low levels of innovation, etc. For instance, Pruchnik and Zowczak (2017) highlighted seven factors, which are often associated with growth slowdowns, namely, unfavourable demographics, low level of economic diversification, inefficient financial markets, insufficient advanced infrastructure, low levels of innovation, weak institutions and inefficient labour markets. According

BOX 1Sri Lanka's Graduation to the Upper Middle Income Country Status

to the classification of Pruchnik and Zowczak (2017), Sri Lanka remained in the bottom 20 per cent in the level of economic diversification and labour market efficiency. Against this backdrop, measures are required to address the challenges emanating from these areas, while also placing emphasis on addressing issues such as income inequality and poverty alleviation to ensure sustainable growth and shared prosperity in the period ahead.

1 For the classifications using data for 2018, the World Bank categorises countries based on their GNI per capita as follows; low income – US dollars 1,025 or less, lower middle income – between US dollars 1,026 and US dollars 3,995, upper middle income – between US dollars 3,996 and US dollars 12,375, high income - US dollars 12,376 or more. These thresholds are updated by the World Bank in the month of July, each year. The World Bank uses the Atlas method to convert national currency GNI to US dollars by applying the Atlas conversion factor, which is the three year moving average exchange rate, after adjusting for the differences between inflation of the country and international inflation.

2 As per some classifications, Sri Lanka is caught in a so-called middle income trap. Economists use this term to represent a scenario where countries that move with speed into middle income levels failing to continue such growth momentum so as to reach high income levels. The definition of middle income trap is not consistent among different studies conducted in this literature, making the number of countries recognised as caught in a middle income trap to differ across different authors. For instance, Pruchnik and Zowczak (2017) compare such different contributions in the middle income trap literature, suggesting that Sri Lanka is caught in the middle income trap as per two studies, thus highlighting the need for measures to avoid such stagnation.

positive, but modest growth rates. The agriculture

sector recorded a growth of 0.6 per cent in

2019 compared to the growth of 6.5 per cent in

2018. Extreme weather conditions affected the

agriculture sector in 2019, with growing of tea,

growing of rubber, marine fishing and marine

aquaculture subsectors and forestry and logging

activities recording notable contractions. On the

other hand, growing of oleaginous fruits, growing of

vegetables, growing of fruits and animal production

mainly supported the growth in value added in the

sector. Meanwhile, the industry sector registered a

growth of 2.7 per cent in 2019, compared to the

growth of 1.2 per cent in the previous year. The

growth of the industry sector was mainly supported

by the manufacture of textiles, wearing apparel

and leather products, the manufacture of food,

beverages and tobacco products, and the revival

of construction and mining and quarrying activities.

Meanwhile, with the impact of the Easter Sunday

attacks on tourism related activities, the growth of

the services sector decelerated significantly to 2.3

per cent in 2019, compared to the growth of 4.6 per

cent in 2018. Activities in accommodation, food and

beverage services recorded a contraction during

2019. Activities in wholesale and retail trade mainly

contributed to the growth of the services sector,

while telecommunication and IT programming

consultancy and related activities continued to

record a double digit growth.

According to GDP estimates based on

the expenditure approach, growth in 2019

was driven by consumption growth and

the improvement in the external balance of

goods and services. The share of consumption

expenditure in GDP at current prices increased

to 78.7 per cent in 2019 from 77.0 per cent in the

previous year. Consumption expenditure grew

by 3.5 per cent in real terms during the year, as

a combined outcome of household consumption

expenditure and government consumption

expenditure growing by 2.9 per cent and 9.6 per

cent, respectively. Net external demand for goods

and services improved in real terms by 23.2 per

cent, and its share in GDP at current prices also

improved to -6.1 per cent in 2019, from -7.4 per cent

in 2018. Meanwhile, the share of investment in GDP

at current prices declined sharply to 27.4 per cent

in 2019, compared to 30.4 per cent in the previous

year, recording a negative real growth in investment

of 9.5 per cent. Domestic savings as a percentage

of GDP at current prices declined to 21.3 per cent

in 2019 from 23.0 per cent recorded in 2018, while

national savings as a percentage of GDP also

declined to 25.3 per cent in 2019 from 27.3 per cent

in the previous year, as a result of the continued

decline in net primary income from the rest of the

world. However, due to the higher contraction

in investment expenditure, both the domestic

savings-investment gap as well as the national

savings-investment gap narrowed in 2019 to 6.1

per cent and 2.1 per cent of GDP, respectively, from

7.4 per cent and 3.1 per cent of GDP in 2018.

The agriculture sector recorded a modest

growth of 0.6 per cent in 2019, compared to

the growth of 6.5 per cent in 2018, reflecting

the impact of the extreme weather conditions

observed during most months of the year.

In 2019, growing of oleaginous fruits, especially

coconut production, recorded improved

performance with a notable growth of 18.2 per

cent, mainly due to the lag effect of the favourable

weather conditions that prevailed in the latter part

of 2018. Meanwhile, paddy production in 2019

increased to 4.6 million MT, an equivalent of 2.9

million MT of rice, which was estimated to be

adequate to meet the domestic demand for rice

for approximately 14 months. Consequently, rice

imports dropped significantly, in 2019, to 24,193

MT, from 248,901 MT in 2018. However, the

production of paddy declined during the 2019 Yala

season compared to the previous Yala season

due to dry weather conditions. Further, cultivation

activities of the 2019/2020 Maha season slowed in

comparison to the bumper harvest recorded in the

previous Maha season, resulting in a contraction in

activities related to growing of paddy in the fourth

quarter of 2019. Overall, the contraction in the

2019 Yala season and 2019/2020 Maha season

cultivation activities resulted in a negative growth

of 0.3 per cent in value added in the growing of

rice subsector in 2019. Meanwhile, growing of tea

recorded a negative growth of 1.3 per cent in 2019,

resulting from the dry weather conditions that

prevailed in the first half of the year, disruptions in

labour supply amidst wage related trade disputes

in the tea sector, and slowing of tea plucking

activities due to heavy rains in the latter part of

the year. Moreover, rubber production declined

to a record low of 74.8 million kilogrammes in

2019, resulting in a contraction of 9.5 per cent in

activities related to growing of rubber. Disruptions

in tapping activities due to the unfavourable

weather conditions in the latter part of the year

and abandoning of tapping activities due to low

prices domestically and globally contributed to

the contraction in rubber sector activities in 2019.

Further, marine fish production was affected by

inclement weather, such as cyclones and heavy

rains, during most part of 2019, resulting in a

contraction of 5.5 per cent in the marine fishing and

marine aquaculture subsector. Further, forestry

and logging activities also registered a contraction

of 4.8 per cent in 2019.

The industry sector performance somewhat

improved in 2019, recording a growth of 2.7

per cent during the year, compared to the

growth of 1.2 per cent in 2018. The construction

and mining and quarrying subsectors grew by 4.0

per cent and 2.8 per cent, respectively, in 2019,

mainly supported by the government infrastructure

development projects, compared to contractions

of 2.5 per cent and 5.2 per cent, respectively,

recorded in 2018. Meanwhile, manufacturing

activities, which accounted for 15.6 per cent of

GDP, registered a subdued growth of 1.9 per cent

in 2019, compared to the growth of 3.6 per cent

in the preceding year. In 2019, the manufacturing

of textiles, wearing apparel and leather products

subsector grew by 3.9 per cent, compared to

the growth of 3.4 per cent in 2018, with the

gradual recovery in demand for exported goods.

Meanwhile, the growth of the manufacture of food,

beverages and tobacco subsector decelerated

to 3.4 per cent in 2019 from 4.0 per cent in the

previous year, reflecting the impact of dampened

domestic demand in the aftermath of the Easter

Sunday attacks. The manufacture of coke and

refined petroleum products subsector grew

notably by 23.4 per cent in 2019, compared to

the contraction of 8.2 per cent in 2018, amidst the

temporary shutdown of the refinery of the Ceylon

Petroleum Corporation (CPC) for maintenance

purposes.

Growth of the services sector halved to

2.3 per cent in 2019 compared to 2018, as the

impact of the Easter Sunday attacks slowed

activities in most of the subsectors. The

accommodation, food and beverage activities

subsector, which was the most affected subsector,

contracted by 4.6 per cent in 2019, compared

to the growth of 5.7 per cent in 2018. Reflecting

the spillover effects of the Easter Sunday attacks

and the general slowdown in economic activity, a

deceleration was observed in growth of activities in

several other subsectors, including wholesale and

retail trade (growth of 3.0 per cent), transportation

of goods and passengers, including warehousing

(growth of 1.4 per cent), financial service activities

and auxiliary financial services (growth of 2.0 per

cent), real estate activities, including ownership

of dwelling and other personal services (growth

of 2.4 per cent) in 2019. Meanwhile, activity in

public administration and defence grew by 2.1

per cent in 2019 compared to a contraction of

0.6 per cent in 2018. The telecommunication and

information technology subsectors displayed a

robust performance, growing at 17.2 per cent and

13.1 per cent, respectively, during 2019.

Reflecting subdued economic activity, the

unemployment rate increased to 4.8 per cent in

2019 from 4.4 per cent in 2018. Male and female

unemployment rates rose to 3.3 per cent and 7.4

per cent, respectively, during 2019, from 3.0 per

cent and 7.1 per cent, respectively, in the previous

year. Meanwhile, the Labour Force Participation

Rate (LFPR) increased marginally to 52.3 per cent

in 2019 from 51.8 per cent in 2018, primarily due to

an increase in LFPR of females. Accordingly, LFPR

for females increased to 34.5 per cent in 2019 from

33.6 per cent in 2018. However, the male LFPR

remained unchanged at 73.0 per cent in 2019.

Despite the increase in the unemployment rate,

the employed population increased by 2.1 per cent

to 8.181 million in 2019 along with a higher LFPR.

Meanwhile, the services sector, which is the largest

sector of the economy, contributed 47.1 per cent of

the total employment, followed by the industry and

agriculture sectors, contributing 27.6 per cent and

25.3 per cent of the total employment, respectively,

in 2019. In terms of employment status, shares of

public sector employees, private sector employees,

employers, own account workers, and contributing

family workers were 14.9 per cent, 43.0 per cent,

2.6 per cent, 32.5 per cent, and 7.0 per cent,

respectively, in 2019.

Despite transient supply side disturbances,

both headline and core inflation moved broadly

in the desired range of 4-6 per cent during 2019,

mainly as a result of subdued demand conditions

and well anchored inflation expectations. With

survey based upward adjustments to house rentals

and education fees, headline inflation as measured

by the movements in the Colombo Consumer

Price Index (CCPI, 2013=100) accelerated at the

beginning of 2019. Contributed also by the revisions

of administratively determined prices and taxes

on certain food and non food items, CCPI based

year-on-year headline inflation accelerated from

3.7 per cent in January 2019 to 5.0 per cent in

May 2019, before easing during the ensuing

three months to record 3.4 per cent in August

2019. However, subsequent adverse weather

conditions caused high food inflation, resulting in

an acceleration of headline inflation to reach 5.4

per cent in October 2019, following which headline

inflation remained below 5.0 per cent during the

remainder of the year. Accordingly, CCPI based

year-on-year headline inflation was recorded at 4.8

per cent in December 2019, in comparison to 2.8

per cent in December 2018. Meanwhile, headline

inflation, based on the National Consumer Price

Index (NCPI, 2013=100) that attributes a higher

weight to food items, followed the trend of CCPI

based inflation during the first half of 2019, although

remaining notably low. Nevertheless, NCPI based

year-on-year headline inflation accelerated during

the second half of 2019, reflecting the impact of

supply side disruptions, and reached 6.2 per cent

in December 2019, compared to 0.4 per cent

recorded at end 2018. Meanwhile, year-on-year

headline inflation based on both the CCPI and the

NCPI accelerated at the beginning of 2020, mainly

due to persistently high food inflation. As such,

year-on-year headline inflation based on the CCPI

reached 6.2 per cent in February 2020, while

year-on-year inflation based on the NCPI peaked

at 8.1 per cent in February 2020. However, as food

inflation eased, year-on-year headline inflation

based on the CCPI and the NCPI decelerated

to 5.4 per cent and 7.0 per cent, respectively, in

March 2020, in spite of the disruptions caused

by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Meanwhile, core inflation, which excludes volatile

food, energy and transport groups from headline

inflation, registered an increase at the beginning

of 2019 due to the impact of the revision of house

rentals and education fees in the CCPI basket, and

remained at elevated levels during the remainder

of the year. Accordingly, in December 2019,

year-on-year core inflation based on the CCPI and

the NCPI remained at 4.8 per cent and 5.2 per cent,

respectively, compared to 3.1 per cent recorded

by both the indices in December 2018. In the first

quarter of 2020, core inflation based on the CCPI

and the NCPI decelerated, mostly on account of

the base effect, and was recorded at 2.9 per cent

and 3.2 per cent, respectively, in March 2020.

External Sector Developments

Policies to curtail import expenditure

resulted in a notable improvement in the trade

and current account balances, which, along

with significant inflows to the financial account,

helped strengthen gross official reserves and

stabilise the exchange rate. The improvement in

the trade balance was mainly due to the reduction

in import expenditure amidst the policy induced

contraction in merchandise imports, while the

modest growth of export earnings also contributed

to a lower trade deficit in 2019. The surplus in

the services account moderated in 2019, mainly

reflecting the adverse impact of the Easter Sunday

attacks on tourist earnings and receipts from air

passenger services. The deficit in the primary

income account widened during the year with an

increase in dividend payments and reinvested

earnings by direct investment enterprises (DIEs),

while interest payments on portfolio investment

also rose marginally during 2019. Meanwhile, the

surplus in the secondary income account narrowed

further in 2019 reflecting the continued moderating

trend in workers’ remittances observed over

the past few years. Overall, the current account

deficit declined in 2019, as the improvement in

the merchandise trade balance outweighed the

moderation in trade in services and secondary

income as well as the widening of the primary income

deficit. Meanwhile, the financial account recorded

significant inflows in 2019, including proceeds

of the International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) and

the receipt of two tranches of the Extended Fund

Facility of the International Monetary Fund (IMF-

EFF). However, inward foreign direct investment

(FDI) moderated, while foreign investment in the

government securities market and the Colombo

Stock Exchange (CSE) recorded net outflows in

2019. Meanwhile, notable debt repayments were

recorded by the government in 2019, including

the settlement of two ISBs and the scheduled

repayments on syndicated loan facilities. Despite

the large foreign currency debt service payments

by the government, significant inflows of foreign

currency to the government and the Central Bank

strengthened gross official reserves. This reflected

the surplus in the overall balance of BOP in 2019.

Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan rupee recorded a

marginal appreciation of 0.6 per cent against the

US dollar in 2019, compared to the significant

depreciation recorded in 2018. This appreciation

of the currency mainly reflected the impact of the

notable contraction in the trade deficit, in spite

of pressure witnessed in the domestic foreign

exchange market in the aftermath of the Easter

Sunday attacks and amidst outflows of foreign

investment from the government securities market

during the second half of 2019. The Central Bank

maintained flexibility in the determination of the

exchange rate during the year, while intervening

only to prevent any excessive volatility of the Sri

Lankan rupee and buildup reserves. Reflecting

the nominal appreciation of the Sri Lankan

rupee against the currencies of several major

trading partners together with the movements

in the cross currency exchange rates, both the

Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) and

the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) indices

appreciated in 2019.

Earnings from merchandise exports

increased marginally in 2019 compared to 2018,

as the growth in export earnings from industrial

exports was partly offset by the contraction in

earnings from agriculture and mineral exports.

Accordingly, earnings from merchandise exports

increased by 0.4 per cent to US dollars 11,940

million in 2019 from US dollars 11,890 million in

2018. Earnings from industrial exports, which

accounted for about 79 per cent of total export

earnings, increased by 1.8 per cent to US dollars

9,426 million in 2019. Earnings from industrial

exports were supported by the growth of earnings

from textiles and garments (5.2 per cent), gems,

diamonds and jewellery (10.0 per cent), transport

equipment (21.3 per cent) and base metals and

articles (6.7 per cent). However, certain categories

of industrial exports recorded a decline in 2019,

including petroleum products (16.2 per cent),

leather, travel goods and footwear (30.3 per cent)

and machinery and mechanical appliances (8.0 per

cent). Earnings from agricultural exports, which

accounted for about 21 per cent of total exports,

declined by 4.6 per cent to US dollars 2,462 million

in 2019, reflecting lower earnings from most sub

categories, in particular tea (5.7 per cent) and

spices (13.2 per cent). However, earnings from

coconut exports increased by 6.0 per cent, as

the export of both coconut kernel and non kernel

products increased in volume terms. Meanwhile,

earnings from mineral exports declined by 1.4

per cent in 2019. The USA remained the major

export destination accounting for 26.3 per cent of

Sri Lanka’s exports, followed by the UK (8.4 per

cent), India (6.4 per cent), Germany (5.4 per cent)

and Italy (4.4 per cent) in 2019. The export volume

index increased by 7.2 per cent, while the unit

value index declined by 6.3 per cent, implying that

the low growth in export earnings was driven by

lower prices in 2019, compared to 2018.

Expenditure on merchandise imports

declined notably in 2019, reflecting the impact

of policy measures implemented to curtail non

essential imports, while lower import prices

also contributed to this decline. Accordingly,

expenditure on imports declined by 10.3 per cent to

US dollars 19,937 million in 2019 from US dollars

22,233 million in 2018. Meanwhile, expenditure

on non fuel imports declined by 11.3 per cent to

US dollars 16,045 million in 2019. Expenditure on

intermediate goods imports, which accounted for

57 per cent of total imports, declined by 9.0 per

cent in 2019, led by the decline in expenditure

on gold (99.4 per cent), fuel (6.3 per cent), base

metals (17.6 per cent) and fertiliser (15.4 per cent).

However, an increase was recorded in import

expenditure on mineral products (34.0 per cent)

and textiles and textile articles (1.8 per cent) in

2019. Expenditure on consumer goods imports,

which accounted for about 20 per cent of total

imports, declined significantly by 20.5 per cent

to US dollars 3,957 million in 2019, reflecting the

decline in expenditure on both food and beverages

and non food consumer goods. Import expenditure

on food and beverages declined by 11.2 per cent,

due to lower expenditure on food categories such

as rice (88.0 per cent), sugar and confectionery

(19.4 per cent) and dairy products (6.1 per cent),

while an increase was recorded in expenditure on

seafood (8.8 per cent), vegetables (2.0 per cent)

and spices (1.3 per cent). Meanwhile, expenditure

on the import of non food consumer goods declined

by 25.0 per cent in 2019, compared to 2018. This

notable reduction was mainly due to the decline in

personal vehicle imports by 48.2 per cent to US

dollars 816 million in 2019, supported by the policy

measures implemented during the latter part of 2018

and the increased tax structure on most categories

of personal vehicle imports in the government

Budget 2019 presented in March 2019. However,

some acceleration of vehicle imports was observed

towards the end of 2019, with the resumption of

imports under concessionary permits given to

public officials. The restrictions imposed in 2018

on the selected non essential consumer goods

were also removed in March 2019. Nevertheless,

expenditure on most non essential consumer

goods continued to decline in 2019, while import

expenditure on medical and pharmaceuticals

and household and furniture items increased.

With sluggish economic growth, expenditure on

investment goods, which accounted for about 23

per cent of total import expenditure, declined by

1.9 per cent to US dollars 4,603 million in 2019. In

terms of the countrywise distribution of Sri Lanka’s

import expenditure, China accounted for the largest

share of 20.2 per cent, followed by India (19.6 per

cent), the United Arab Emirates (8.4 per cent),

Singapore (4.8 per cent) and Japan (4.4 per cent).

11

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

The import volume index and the unit value index

recorded declines by 5.8 per cent and 4.8 per cent,

respectively, in 2019, indicating that the decline in

import expenditure was due to a combined effect

of lower volumes and prices, compared to 2018.

Meanwhile, considering the possible impact of

the COVID-19 pandemic on the BOP, measures

were implemented in March 2020, to suspend the

importation of certain categories of motor vehicles

and non essential consumer goods for a period of

three months.

The trade balance improved significantly

in 2019, recording the lowest deficit since

2013. This was driven by the sharp contraction in

import expenditure, which was mainly attributed

to the reduction in imports of motor vehicles and

gold in 2019, responding to the policy measures

implemented by the government and the Central

Bank in 2018 to curtail such imports amidst

external sector pressures. Meanwhile, earnings

from exports, which rose notably during the first

half of 2019, moderated in the second half of the

year, recording only a modest growth in 2019. The

trade deficit in 2019 was recorded at US dollars

7,997 million, a decline of US dollars 2,346 million,

compared to the deficit of US dollars 10,343 million

recorded in 2018. The trade deficit, as a percentage

of GDP, declined to 9.5 per cent in 2019 from 11.7

per cent in 2018.

Mainly driven by the contraction in the trade

deficit, the current account balance improved

significantly in 2019, despite the widening of the

primary income deficit and the moderation of

services and secondary income balances. The

surplus in the services account weakened to US

dollars 2,849 million in 2019 from US dollars 3,766

million in 2018, mainly due to modest earnings from

tourism reflecting the impact of the Easter Sunday

attacks, which resulted in a decline in tourist

arrivals to 1.9 million in 2019 from 2.3 million in the

previous year. The deficit in the primary income

account widened in 2019 to US dollars 2,426 million

in 2019, compared to US dollars 2,385 million

in the previous year, due to increased dividend

payments and re-invested earnings of DIEs, while

interest payments also increased marginally in

2019. Meanwhile, workers’ remittances continued

to moderate in 2019, thus reducing the surplus in

the secondary income account to US dollars 5,766

million in 2019 in comparison to US dollars 6,163

million in 2018. Consequently, the current account

deficit narrowed notably to US dollars 1,808 million

in 2019, which was 2.2 per cent of GDP, compared

to 3.2 per cent in 2018.

In 2019, the financial account recorded

significant inflows, mainly to the government,

amidst outflows of portfolio investment and

large debt repayments. The financial account

was strengthened by the two ISB issuances in

March and June 2019 amounting to US dollars

4.4 billion and the receipt of the sixth and seventh

tranches of the IMF-EFF amounting to US dollars

327 million. However, FDI inflows moderated in

2019 compared to the previous year, while foreign

investment recorded net outflows from the CSE

and the government securities market, driven by

the dampened investor sentiment in the aftermath

of the Easter Sunday attacks and uncertainties in

global markets in the second half of 2019. Financial

flows on account of foreign debt service payments

increased in 2019 with the maturity of two ISBs

amounting to US dollars 1.5 billion, in addition to the

scheduled payments of syndicated loans. Financial

flows in relation to the banking sector, private sector

and state owned business enterprises (SOBEs)

recorded net outflows, mainly reflecting the increased

debt repayments in 2019. Outflows, particularly

12

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

1

from the government securities market, continued

in the first quarter of 2020, amidst heightened

uncertainties in global financial markets with the

spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Gross official reserves improved by end

2019, supported by significant inflows to the

government and the Central Bank, despite large

foreign currency debt service payments by

the government in 2019. Gross official reserves

increased to US dollars 7.6 billion by end 2019 from

US dollars 6.9 billion at end 2018. The proceeds

from the issuances of two ISBs, the receipts of

two tranches of the IMF-EFF and the purchase

of foreign exchange by the Central Bank from

the domestic foreign exchange market, primarily

contributed to enhance gross official reserves by

end 2019. The country’s gross official reserves at

end 2019 could cover about 4.6 months of imports

and about 57 per cent of its short term liabilities.

Furthermore, total international reserves, which

consist of gross official reserves and foreign assets

of depository corporations, increased to US dollars

10.4 billion by end 2019, equivalent to 6.3 months

of imports.

Sri Lanka’s external debt increased further

by end 2019, mainly due to the rise in external

debt of the government. Total external debt of

the country increased to US dollars 55.9 billion by

end 2019, which was equivalent to 66.6 per cent of

GDP, compared to 59.2 per cent of GDP recorded

by the end of 2018. The outstanding balance of

ISBs, based on market value, increased to US

dollars 15.2 billion at end 2019, reflecting the net

impact of new ISB issuances and maturities. The

outstanding balance of non residents’ holding of

Treasury bonds declined notably in 2019, while

the non residents’ holdings of Treasury bills

recorded a marginal increase during the year.

Meanwhile, the outstanding balance of foreign

loans of the government declined marginally

due to net repayments in 2019. The outstanding

external liabilities of the Central Bank increased

with the receipt of the IMF-EFF tranches and the

marginal increase in liabilities to the Asian Clearing

Union (ACU) by end 2019. However, the external

liability position of the banking sector declined due

to the maturity of an international bond issued by

the National Savings Bank and the decrease in

outstanding loan liabilities of Licensed Commercial

Banks (LCBs). The intercompany borrowings by

DIEs recorded an increase, reflecting the increase

in intercompany loans as well as shareholder

advances by major companies at end 2019.

The exchange rate remained broadly

stable during 2019, supported by a significant

improvement in the current account, despite

some transient volatility experienced amidst

outflows of portfolio investment, responding

to domestic and global developments. The

exchange rate strengthened during the first four

months of 2019, as a result of the significant

contraction in the trade deficit and an increase

in financial inflows. However, the exchange rate

experienced some pressure in the immediate

aftermath of the Easter Sunday attacks, and

towards the latter part of 2019, reflecting the impact

of heightened uncertainties in global markets, which

resulted in some unwinding of portfolio investment

by foreigners. Nevertheless, favourable liquidity

conditions that prevailed in the domestic foreign

exchange market during most of 2019 enabled the

Central Bank to absorb US dollars 387 million, on

a net basis, in 2019. Overall, the Sri Lankan rupee

appreciated by 0.6 per cent against the US dollar

in 2019, compared to the significant depreciation

of 16.4 per cent in 2018. Aligning with the nominal

appreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee against the

13

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

currencies of several major trading partners, and

together with the movements in the cross currency

exchange rates, both the NEER and REER indices

appreciated in 2019. However, the REER indices

remained below the base year level, reflecting the

country’s competitiveness in terms of the exchange

rate. The Central Bank continued to allow flexibility

in the determination of the exchange rate based

on market fundamentals, while intervening in the

domestic foreign exchange market only to prevent

excessive volatility of the Sri Lankan rupee and

to build reserves. Meanwhile, the exchange rate,

which remained stable up to the second week of

March 2020, witnessed significant pressure with

the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, while

speculation by market participants and foreign

investors also weighed on the stability of the

currency. The government and the Central Bank

introduced several measures to curb the excessive

pressure on the external sector, while allowing

the rupee to depreciate in line with currencies of

regional peers.

Fiscal Sector Developments

The process of fiscal consolidation faced

significant challenges in 2019, amidst the

notable decline in government revenue and

the rise in government expenditure. Due to the

political impasse in the fourth quarter of 2018, the

submission of the government Budget 2019 was

delayed until March 2019, and fiscal operations

were conducted on a Vote on Account from

January through early April 2019. The government

Budget 2019, which was approved on 5 April 2019,

aimed at reducing the budget deficit to 4.4 per cent

of GDP in 2019 from 5.3 per cent of GDP in 2018,

while targeting surpluses in the current account

and the primary balance of 0.2 per cent and 1.5

per cent of GDP, respectively. However, fiscal

performance worsened in 2019 due to the notable

decline in government revenue caused by the

sizeable import compression, particularly of motor

vehicles, subpar economic activity exacerbated

by the Easter Sunday attacks, as well as the rise

in recurrent expenditure mainly on account of

subsidies and transfers, and salaries and wages.

Further, the delays in implementation of certain

revenue measures proposed in the government

Budget 2019 also contributed to weak revenue

performance in 2019. Consequently, the major

fiscal indicators deviated from the envisaged

levels in the Budget 2019, and also in comparison

to 2018. Accordingly, the budget deficit rose to

6.8 per cent of GDP in 2019, from 5.3 per cent of

GDP in 2018. The current account deficit, which

reflects the government’s dissavings, increased to

2.7 per cent of GDP in 2019, from 1.2 per cent in

the previous year, and the primary balance, which

excludes interest payments from the overall budget

deficit, recorded a deficit of 0.8 per cent of GDP in

2019, compared to a surplus of 0.6 per cent of GDP

in 2018. Consequently, central government debt as

a percentage of GDP rose to 86.8 per cent by end

2019 from 83.7 per cent at end 2018, reflecting

the impact of higher net borrowings to finance the

budget deficit and the relatively modest growth in

nominal GDP in 2019.

Government revenue as a percentage of GDP

declined to 12.6 per cent in 2019 from 13.4 per

cent in 2018. The decline in revenue from indirect

taxes, mainly excise duty on motor vehicles, Value

Added Tax (VAT), Cess levy, Ports and Airports

Development Levy (PAL) and import duties, resulted

in the lacklustre performance in tax revenue in

2019, in spite of the significant increase observed

in the collection of income tax. In nominal terms,

government revenue decreased by 1.5 per cent to

Rs. 1,890.9 billion in 2019 from Rs. 1,920.0 billion

recorded in the previous year, while tax revenue

increased marginally by 1.3 per cent to Rs. 1,734.9

billion in 2019, owing to the increase in income tax

revenue, particularly from corporate taxes under the

new Inland Revenue Act and debt repayment levy.

In contrast, non tax revenue declined significantly

both in nominal terms and as a percentage of

GDP in 2019, with lower revenue from fees and

charges, non availability of distributable profits from

the Central Bank, and the reduction in profit and

dividend transfers from SOBEs.

Total expenditure and net lending increased

to 19.4 per cent of GDP in 2019 from 18.7 per

cent in 2018, as the increase in recurrent

expenditure outweighed the decline in

capital expenditure and net lending. Recurrent

expenditure as a percentage of GDP increased

to 15.3 per cent in 2019 from 14.5 per cent in

2018. In nominal terms, this was an increase of

10.1 per cent to Rs. 2,301.2 billion in 2019 from

Rs. 2,089.7 billion in 2018. Total interest

expenditure, in nominal terms, increased by 5.8

per cent to Rs. 901.4 billion in 2019 from Rs. 852.2

billion in 2018, while expenditure on foreign interest

payments increased by 16.9 per cent to Rs. 248.6

billion in 2019. The increase in outstanding debt,

especially on account of Treasury bonds and

foreign commercial loans, contributed to the rise

in interest expenditure during the year, despite the

decline in interest rates domestically and globally.

However, capital expenditure and net lending

declined to 4.1 per cent of GDP in 2019 from 4.2

per cent of GDP in 2018. In nominal terms, capital

expenditure and net lending increased by 1.8 per

cent to Rs. 614.1 billion in 2019, in comparison

to Rs. 603.5 billion in 2018. Public investment

declined to 4.2 per cent of GDP (Rs. 631.2 billion)

in 2019 from 4.4 per cent of GDP (Rs. 625.0 billion)

in the previous year.

The budget deficit was largely financed

through domestic sources during 2019.

Accordingly, net domestic financing fulfilled 69.1

per cent of the budget deficit, while the balance was

met from foreign sources. In nominal terms, net

financing from domestic sources increased by 60.6

per cent to Rs. 702.4 billion in 2019, in comparison

to Rs. 437.2 billion in 2018, reflecting an increase

in borrowing from both bank and non bank sources.

Borrowings from the banking sector increased

significantly by 76.4 per cent to Rs. 193.1 billion

in 2019, as reflected in net purchases of Treasury

bills and Treasury bonds by LCBs amounting to

Rs. 312.6 billion in 2019, compared to a net

repayment of Rs. 73.1 billion in 2018. Meanwhile,

the net repayment of Rs. 108.1 billion to the Central

Bank partly offset the increase in net financing from

LCBs amounting to Rs. 301.2 billion in 2019. Net

financing through non bank sources increased to

Rs. 509.3 billion in 2019 from Rs. 327.8 billion in

2018. However, net financing from foreign sources

declined to Rs. 314.1 billion in 2019, in comparison

to Rs. 323.5 billion in 2018, mainly due to a

repayment on account of Foreign Currency Term

Financing Facility (FCTFF) of Rs. 83.5 billion. Net

borrowings through ISBs amounted to Rs. 461.4

billion1 during the year. Meanwhile, foreign project

loans recorded a net repayment of Rs. 15.2 billion

in 2019.

Central government debt as a percentage of

GDP increased to 86.8 per cent at end 2019 from

83.7 per cent at end 2018. This increase was

primarily due to higher net borrowings to finance

the budget deficit, and the relatively modest growth

in nominal GDP in 2019. In nominal terms, central

government debt increased to Rs. 13,031.5 billion

at end 2019, from Rs. 12,030.5 billion at end 2018.

Total outstanding domestic debt increased by 9.2

per cent to Rs. 6,629.1 billion, while the rupee

value of total outstanding foreign debt increased

by 7.4 per cent to Rs. 6,402.4 billion by end 2019.

The nominal increase in the outstanding foreign

debt can partly be attributed to the depreciation

of the Sri Lankan rupee against some currency

denominations in the debt stock. It is noteworthy

that the outstanding debt stock denominated in

foreign currency remains unchanged in foreign

currency terms irrespective of its rupee value

due to exchange rate movements, and is typically

serviced using foreign currency inflows to the

government, thereby rendering exchange rate

movements immaterial.

1 This comprised borrowings through ISBs amounting to Rs. 782.5 billion (US dollars 4.4 billion), repayments amounting to Rs. 269.8 billion in 2019, and an unutilised balance of Rs. 51.4 billion at the end of the year.

Following the notable adjustments to the

fiscal policy direction to revive the economy

after the Presidential Election at end 2019, the

government announced several fiscal measures

during the first quarter of 2020 amidst the

spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. The measures

introduced at end 2019 included a series of tax

concessions, along with other reforms aimed at

increasing the disposable income and encouraging

private consumption and investment. As the country

was forced into a lockdown with the spread of the

COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the Cabinet of

Ministers approved allocation of funds on an urgent

basis for various purposes, including Rs. 5 billion

for settling the payments arrears of the small and

medium scale contractors, Rs. 10 billion for settling

arrears by the government to private institutions

on account of purchasing of pharmaceuticals, and

Rs. 3 billion for settling fertiliser procurement bills.

In addition, the government allocated an additional

Rs. 500 million for preventive activities. Measures

were initiated to establish a fuel price stabilisation

fund, aiming to raise Rs. 200 billion within 6 months

by utilising the benefit of low international fuel

prices. The government extended the deadline of

all payments on VAT and income taxes, and driving

license renewal fees until 30 April 2020. The trainee

allowance of Rs. 20,000 for March 2020 was

granted for all graduates selected for government

employment in the recent recruitment round. The

Agrahara Insurance benefits were doubled for

employees of the health sector, police, civil defence

and all government servants engaged in controlling

the spread of the COVID-19. Measures were

initiated to exempt Lanka Sathosa and Co-operative

shops from VAT and other local taxes and charges.

Further, the Samurdhi Authority was instructed

to issue entitlement certificates to Samurdhi and

low income families immediately, in order to issue

nutritional food items to such families on a weekly

basis. A COVID-19 Healthcare and Social Security

Fund was initiated to facilitate necessary healthcare

and relief measures, while taking measures to

remove taxes and foreign exchange restrictions in

relation to contributions to this Fund. Furthermore,

the government pledged US dollars 5 million to the

SAARC COVID-19 Emergency Fund established to

prevent the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak in the

region. The government implemented a cash grant

scheme of Rs. 5,000 for low income and vulnerable

families and individuals, as a lump sum allowance.

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka’s sovereign credit

rating was affirmed by major international

rating agencies in 2019, despite the downward

revision to the outlook for Sri Lanka. Fitch

Ratings and S&P Global Ratings affirmed

Sri Lanka’s rating at “B”, while revising the outlook

from “Stable” to “Negative” in December 2019 and

January 2020, respectively. The revision of the

outlook mainly reflected the risks stemming from

the possible weakening of the fiscal position of

the country. However, Moody’s Investors Service

(Moody’s) maintained its ratings at “B2” with no

revision to the “Stable” outlook in 2019.2

2 On 17 April 2020, Moody's announced the placing of the Sri Lanka’s rating under review for ‘downgrade’.

Monetary Sector Developments

In an environment of muted demand driven

inflation pressures and well anchored inflation

expectations, the Central Bank adopted an

accommodative monetary policy stance in 2019

to support the revival of economic activity and

address the sluggish growth in credit extended

to the private sector. Within a neutral monetary

policy stance, the Central Bank reduced the

Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) applicable on all

rupee deposit liabilities of LCBs by a total of 2.50

percentage points in November 2018 and March

2019, thereby addressing the persistent liquidity

deficit in the domestic money market. Consequently,

market liquidity turned to surplus levels from mid

April 2019. However, in spite of the improvement

in market liquidity, market interest rates remained

downward rigid. Thus, the Central Bank imposed

interest rate ceilings on deposit products of licensed

banks and non bank financial institutions in April

2019, with a view to expediting the monetary policy

transmission through the financial system. Further,

with the commencement of the accommodative

monetary policy stance, the Central Bank reduced

policy interest rates by a total of 100 basis points,

in May and August 2019, aimed at lowering the

market lending rates and boosting credit flows to

the private sector. Responding to these measures,

deposit interest rates adjusted downwards notably,

while the adjustment of market lending rates

remained grossly inadequate. Consequently, the

Central Bank imposed ceilings on market lending

rates in September 2019, while withdrawing the

deposit rate ceilings imposed on licensed banks.

This resulted in a continued downward adjustment

in market lending rates during the remainder of the

year. However, considering the need for a faster

reduction in market lending rates to support the

slow growth in economic activity, the Central Bank

reduced policy interest rates by a further 50 basis

points in January 2020. Moreover, considering the

spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country

and its potential impact on domestic economic

activity and financial markets, the Central Bank, in

an emergency move, reduced policy rates, in March

and April 2020, by a total of 50 basis points, and

SRR by 1.00 percentage point to 4.00 per cent in

March 2020. Accordingly, effective from the close

of business on 3 April 2020, the Standing Deposit

Facility Rate (SDFR) and Standing Lending Facility

Rate (SLFR) remained at 6.00 per cent and 7.00

per cent, respectively.3

Market interest rates declined during 2019,

as a result of the monetary policy and regulatory

measures of the Central Bank. The Average

Weighted Call Money Rate (AWCMR), which

remained around the upper bound of the policy rate

corridor since September 2018, started to decline

gradually from March 2019 with improved liquidity

conditions, and hovered around the middle of the

policy rate corridor thereafter. A notable decline

in deposit interest rates was observed since May

2019, in response to the imposition of caps on

deposit interest rates in April 2019, improved

liquidity conditions and the reduction in policy

3 Meanwhile, the Bank Rate, the rate at which the Central Bank grants advances to banking institutions as the lender of last resort, was reduced by 500 basis points to 10.00 per cent, with effect from 16 April 2020. The Monetary Board also decided to allow the Bank Rate to adjust automatically with future revisions of the SLFR, with a margin of 300 basis points above the SLFR.

interest rates. Accordingly, the Average Weighted

Deposit Rate (AWDR) declined by 61 basis points

to 8.20 per cent during 2019. Market lending

rates, which remained downward rigid despite the

accommodative monetary policy measures of the

Central Bank, declined notably with the imposition

of caps on lending interest rates in September 2019.

The weekly Average Weighted Prime Lending Rate

(AWPR), which is based on interest rates applicable

on short term loans and advances granted by LCBs

to their prime customers during a week, declined by

235 basis points to 9.74 per cent during 2019. The

Average Weighted Lending Rate (AWLR), which is

based on interest rates of all outstanding loans and

advances extended by LCBs, declined by 81 basis

points to 13.59 per cent during 2019. However,

the reduction in market lending rates during 2019

was less than envisaged. Meanwhile, reflecting

eased monetary conditions, yields on government

securities showed a notable decline during 2019,

although a marginal uptick was observed in yields

on Treasury bills towards the end of 2019 due to

the adverse market speculation on the possible

increase in funding requirements of the government.

However, yields on primary market Treasury bills

decreased by 197-275 basis points across the

tenures during 2019. Yields on Treasury bonds

in the primary market also declined substantially

during 2019, while the government also issued Sri

Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) at competitive

yields. The secondary market yield curve of

government securities shifted downwards during

2019 with a larger adjustment in short to medium

term yields. Interest rates applicable on corporate

debt instruments, which remained elevated during

early 2019, declined gradually by end 2019. Despite

the decline in global interest rates, interest rates

applicable on foreign currency deposits maintained

with LCBs remained broadly unchanged during

2019, reflecting domestic investment opportunities

in foreign currency at competitive rates. Meanwhile,

with global market volatility arising from the spread

of the COVID-19 pandemic, global interest rates

declined rapidly in the first quarter of 2020, while

the downward movement in domestic interest rates

is also expected to accelerate in 2020 to enable a

revival of economic activity that has been severely

affected by the outbreak.

Reserve money recorded a contraction

during 2019, reflecting the impact of the

reduction in SRR in March 2019. Accordingly,

reserve money contracted by 3.0 per cent,

year-on-year, at end 2019 compared to the growth

of 2.3 per cent at end 2018. In absolute terms,

reserve money contracted by Rs. 28.5 billion

to Rs. 932.6 billion by end 2019 compared to

an expansion of Rs. 21.3 billion in the previous

year. Viewed from the liability side, the decline in

LCBs’ deposits with the Central Bank due to the

reduction in SRR in March 2019 contributed to the

contraction of reserve money, while currency in

circulation increased moderately during 2019. In

terms of assets, the contraction of reserve money

during 2019 was mainly reflected in the notable

reduction in net domestic assets (NDA) of the

Central Bank, which outweighed the expansion

in net foreign assets (NFA) of the Central Bank.

Accordingly, NDA of the Central Bank contracted

by Rs. 173.9 billion to Rs. 36.6 billion by end 2019

in comparison to an increase of Rs. 116.9 billion

during 2018, mainly due to the decline in net

credit to the government (NCG) by the Central

Bank as reflected in the reduction of holdings of

government securities by the Central Bank (net of

repurchase transactions). Meanwhile, NFA of the

Central Bank increased by Rs. 145.5 billion during

2019 compared to the decline of Rs. 95.6 billion in

2018. The expansion in NFA was a result of the

increase in foreign assets of the Central Bank due

to the conversion of proceeds of ISBs, purchases

of foreign exchange from the domestic foreign

exchange market and an increase in investment in

fixed income securities by the Central Bank, amidst

a contraction in foreign liabilities of the Central

Bank.

Broad money growth (M2b) continued to

decelerate during 2019, with the moderation

of the growth of NDA of the banking system.

Accordingly, the year-on-year growth of M2b

decelerated to 7.0 per cent by end December 2019

compared to the growth of 13.0 per cent at end 2018.

The moderation in NDA during 2019 was largely

driven by the sluggish growth of credit to the private

sector by LCBs, while the growth of credit obtained

by the public sector, including the government and

SOBEs, also moderated compared to the previous

year. In absolute terms, NDA of the banking system

increased by Rs. 300.6 billion in 2019 compared

to a notable expansion of Rs. 1,008.8 billion in

2018. NCG by the banking system increased by

Rs. 250.4 billion in 2019 compared to an increase

of Rs. 348.2 billion in 2018. Within NCG, credit from

LCBs expanded while NCG by the Central Bank

recorded a contraction during the year. Meanwhile,

borrowings of SOBEs recorded an increase of

Rs. 62.6 billion in 2019 in comparison to the increase

of Rs. 218.4 billion in 2018. NFA of the banking

system increased by Rs. 195.3 billion in 2019, in

comparison to a contraction of Rs. 188.5 billion in

2018, reflecting the rise in NFA of both the Central

Bank and LCBs.

Growth of credit to the private sector

recorded a sharp deceleration in 2019 amidst

high market interest rates, policy uncertainty,

dented business confidence especilly after the

Easter Sunday attacks, and subdued economic

activity during the year, although a recovery

was observed in absolute credit disbursements

towards the end of the year supported by the

measures taken by the Central Bank to ease the

monetary conditions. The year-on-year growth

of credit to the private sector decelerated to 4.3

per cent by end December 2019 from 15.9 per

cent recorded at end 2018. In absolute terms, the

expansion of credit to the private sector was Rs.

236.8 billion in 2019, compared to an expansion

of Rs. 762.1 billion in 2018. The notable slowdown

in growth of credit during the first half of 2019 can

be attributed to the high market lending rates, low

demand for credit amidst subdued economic activity,

which worsened with the Easter Sunday attacks,

and rise in non performing advances of the banking

sector. Nevertheless, credit flows, in absolute terms,

gathered momentum since August 2019 supported

by the easing of monetary conditions. In terms

of sectoral classification, growth of credit to the

Agriculture and Fishing sector decelerated notably

and recorded 0.2 per cent, year-on-year, by end

2019, in comparison to the growth of 14.0 per cent at

end 2018. Growth of credit to both the Industry and

Services sectors slowed to 3.1 per cent by end 2019,

from 15.3 per cent and 17.8 per cent, respectively,

at end 2018. Personal Loans and Advances, which

continued to record a notable growth in the recent

past, also moderated to 11.9 per cent by end 2019,

compared to the growth of 20.3 per cent at end 2018.

Meanwhile, credit as a percentage of GDP,

which is an indicator of financial deepening of the

economy, displayed mixed movements in 2019.

Having risen continuously from 26.4 per cent in 2013

to 38.7 per cent in 2018, credit to the private sector by

LCBs as a percentage of GDP declined marginally to

38.6 per cent in 2019. Credit to the private sector in

the monetary aggregate M4, which covers Licensed

Specialised Banks (LSBs) and Licensed Finance

Companies (LFCs) in addition to LCBs, also followed

a similar trend, declining to 51.9 per cent of GDP

in 2019 from 52.2 per cent in the previous year.

Reflecting the rise in credit to the public sector during

the year, domestic credit as a percentage of GDP in

relation to M2b and M4, continued to increase, recording

62.5 per cent and 80.4 per cent, respectively, at end

2019, compared to 61.5 per cent and 79.1 per cent,

respectively, in 2018.

terms of assets base, credit quality and profitability

of financial institutions due to the challenging

business environment created by subdued

economic growth, policy uncertainty, and the

deterioration of investor sentiments stemming from

the Easter Sunday attacks. The banking sector,

which dominates the financial sector, displayed a

moderate expansion during the year, compared to

the previous year, reflecting the impact of the low

demand for credit and tightened credit screening

in an environment of deteriorating credit quality.

The moderation of credit flows to the private sector

during 2019 caused more funds of banks to shift

towards risk free government securities, which

in return improved the capital and liquidity levels

of the banking sector. The deterioration of credit

quality was reflected by the increase in the non

performing loans (NPLs) ratio in 2019, compared

to the previous year. Deposits, which continued to

be the main source of funding, grew in 2019, albeit

at a slower pace compared to the previous year,

while borrowings contracted in terms of both Sri

Lankan rupees and foreign currency. Meanwhile,

the profitability of the sector deteriorated in 2019,

as reflected by the movements in return on assets

(ROA) and return on equity (ROE), mainly due

to high operating costs, an increase in loan loss

provisions and taxes. Meanwhile, the Financial

Action Task Force (FATF) delisted Sri Lanka from

its Grey List in October 2019, recognising the

significant progress made by Sri Lanka in improving

its Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Countering

the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) regime.

The performance of Licensed Finance

Companies (LFCs) and Specialised Leasing

Companies (SLCs) deteriorated during the

year, owing to unfavourable market conditions

and sector weaknesses. Negative credit growth,

declining profitability and an increase in NPLs

contributed to the weak performance of the

sector during 2019. The Central Bank initiated

several stringent regulatory actions and safeguard

measures during 2019, in view of ensuring long

term sustainability of the sector while seeking to

ensure the safety of depositors. The total asset

base of the sector expanded marginally during the

year, while credit growth of the sector remained

negative in 2019. The investment portfolio recorded

a significant increase, due to increased investment

in government securities, equities, units and other

debt instruments, and real estate amidst limited

demand for credit and the cautious approach in

lending by the sector. The deterioration in asset

quality of the sector was reflected by the increase in

NPL ratio in 2019. Meanwhile, the sector recorded

a substantial decline in profit after tax, compared

to the profit recorded in 2018, mainly due to an

increase in non interest expenses and high loan loss

provisions. Signs of stress on profitability were also

reflected by the decline in ROA and ROE during the

year. The insurance sector expanded moderately

during 2019, recording a growth in its assets

base. Contractual savings institutions, dominated

by the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) and the

Employees’ Trust Fund (ETF), recorded moderate

performance while providing reasonable positive

real returns to the membership.

Financial markets remained liquid during

2019, and the Central Bank managed liquidity

appropriately throughout the year. Liquidity in

the domestic money market, which was in deficit

levels until mid April 2019, turned into a surplus

except for a brief period in August and September

during 2019. The downward revision of the

SRR in March, conversion of ISB proceeds, and

foreign currency purchases by the Central Bank

helped maintain surplus liquidity in 2019. The

liquidity deficit observed in the market in August

2019 with the maturing of foreign currency swap

transactions and Treasury bills held by the Central

The COVID-19 outbreak that was first detected in China in late 2019, rapidly spread across the globe prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it as a pandemic by mid March 2020. To date, the pandemic has left an unprecedented trail of both humanitarian and economic damage in all countries. With 2.5 million people infected and more than 150,000 deaths by mid April, the economic repercussions of the ongoing ‘Great Lockdown’ are expected to dwarf the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-08. Policymakers around the world are struggling to grapple with this crisis episode amidst numerous uncertainties. While Sri Lanka has been relatively successful in combating the outbreak thus far, as a result of early measures adopted to contain the spread, the interplay of setbacks to domestic economic activity stemming from such containment measures and spillover effects from the global economy are likely to have a notable impact on the Sri Lankan economy during the year.

Spread and Containment of COVID-19 in Sri Lanka

In Sri Lanka, infections were limited to a single person until 11 March 2020, but the number escalated rapidly to 50 and then to over 300 confirmed cases, with 7 casualties by mid April 2020. Despite introducing awareness measures that had prevented any outbreak till early March, the continued arrival of tourists, the return of Sri Lankans from countries that were most affected by the virus, and the lack of adherence to the containment measures that were imposed from mid March 2020 fuelled the outbreak. Nevertheless, efforts to restrict the mobility of people by enforcing police curfew in the country, the closure of airports from 19 March 2020, and actions to quarantine returnees from abroad helped to largely contain the spread – the identified pockets are mainly clustered in a few areas in the Western Province and the Districts of Puttalam and Jaffna. The government established two high level units to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, while easing the difficulties faced by the public amidst restrictions imposed on mobility. Accordingly, the National Operation Centre for Prevention of the COVID-19 Outbreak coordinates the preventive and management measures of the outbreak, while ensuring the provision of healthcare and other services to the general public. The Presidential Task Force directs, coordinates and monitors the delivery of continuous essential services, paying special attention to low income families and vulnerable persons in the society.

With due consideration to the need to protect the local economy, an exit strategy is being rolled out across the island. Measures include reduction of the timespan of the curfew period, operation of workplaces and businesses

BOX 2COVID-19 and Sri Lanka: Challenges, Policy Responses and Outlook

with minimal staff, the continuation of teleworking as much as possible and cautious resumption of road and rail transport services. The ban on large gatherings is likely to remain in place for some time.

Economic Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Sri Lanka

While the containment measures adopted have helped curb the outbreak, they have had a substantial negative impact on economic activity on the domestic front. The declaration of holidays, curfew, restricted public services and other measures to contain human movement including the shutdown of airports and seaports for passenger traffic will affect several key economic sectors. The socio-economic impact could also be extensive with the loss of income and livelihoods for a large segment of society. With approximately 60 per cent of those employed being engaged in the informal sector and an estimated 1.9 million being daily wage earners, a large number of households is likely to be in a precarious position. Other vulnerable segments of the population, such as the elderly and the large number of people living just above the poverty threshold, will be disproportionately affected by this episode. Although Sri Lanka has not seen any significant strain on the public healthcare system due to proactive mitigation measures, any unexpected rise of the spread could take a significant toll on the limited capacity of the system.

The global economy is currently seeing its worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Several advanced economies such as the United States, the United Kingdom, the Eurozone, and Japan will experience contractions during 2020. Other key trading partners of Sri Lanka, including China and India, are also projected to experience a notable slowdown. Across the globe, the World Trade Organization (WTO) forecasts that global merchandise trade can decline by as much as 32 per cent in 2020. While the poor economic performance of key trading partners will directly impact Sri Lanka’s export earnings due to weakened demand, the imposition of various measures domestically and abroad to dampen the spread and the short term economic impact of the outbreak can cause supply chain disruptions, thereby impacting the country’s current and future export capacity.

Despite a rapid recovery from the Easter Sunday attacks, the tourism industry is likely to experience the brunt of not only the current pandemic but also its aftermath that may be long lasting and persistent. The overall downturn in the global economy and the economic woes in countries and regions, from which Sri Lanka has been traditionally attracting tourists, including China, India and Europe, will hinder the recovery of the tourism sector. Further, global

22

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

health policymakers are consistently raising concerns about possible ‘second waves’ of the outbreak, thereby emphasising the need to maintain ‘physical distancing’ for several months after the abatement of the pandemic. Hence, this current standstill of the tourism industry may be protracted if there is any substantial shift in consumer sentiment against travel and leisure.

Another key spillover effect of the contraction of the global economy is the decline in remittances, which have been a vital cushion for Sri Lanka’s external sector. In recent years, the leading shares of workers’ remittances have been from the Middle East, the European Union, and Far East Asia. While Europe and Far East Asia have been substantially impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak in their respective regions, the Middle East has been impacted by not only the pandemic, but also the sudden decline in international crude oil prices resulting from weakened global demand and the subsequent fallout of the OPEC+ coalition. Although the reduced fuel import bill would ease the burden on the trade deficit, the overall impact on the external current account, arising from the developments in merchandise and services trade and remittances, is likely to be negative in 2020.

Amidst these economic weaknesses, countries have been adopting increasingly accommodative monetary policy stances and undertaking unconventional monetary policies to ensure the provision of ample liquidity to be channeled through the financial sector to households and firms. The resultant low levels of global interest rates can imply a potential easing of costs of refinancing of debt repayments in countries such as Sri Lanka. However, such positive effects have thus far been negated by the capital flow reversals that are being seen across emerging market economies, including Sri Lanka. Although Sri Lanka’s exposure to short term capital flows is marginal, this has resulted in the sharp escalation of Sri Lanka’s international sovereign bond yields, similar to the experience of other emerging market and developing economies. In addition, across the globe, foreign direct investment flows are likely to be affected by uncertainties caused by the pandemic, which will also impact Sri Lanka’s prospects of attracting non debt creating capital flows in the near term.

Hence, through various direct and indirect channels, including the ongoing diversion of additional financial resources to support economic activity, the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely impact the progress of the economy during the year, contrary to previous expectations of a rebound in economic growth. Accordingly, real GDP growth is expected to decelerate to around 1.5 per cent in 2020, before the economy recovers to attain its envisaged potential over the medium term.

Implementation of Revival Measures

Similar to other countries across the globe, Sri Lanka has utilised three types of policies to address the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects: a) border control and health sector policies; b) fiscal measures; and c) monetary and financial sector measures, including capital flow management. Border control and health sector policies attempt to contain the spread of the pandemic, while the other policies adopted by the government and the Central Bank seek to provide relief to businesses and individuals affected by the pandemic and address emerging macroeconomic concerns.

In relation to monetary measures, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, thus far, has reduced the key policy interest rates, namely the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR), by 100 basis points across three cuts, two of which were undertaken during emergency reviews in the months of March and April 2020. The Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) on all rupee deposit liabilities of licensed commercial banks (LCBs) was reduced by 1.00 percentage point, thereby injecting permanent liquidity of around Rs. 65 billion to the market. A large surplus has been maintained in the domestic money market through open market operations (OMOs) of various types and maturities, in order to avail sufficient liquidity for financial institutions, enabling them to facilitate urgent financial requirements of the economy. Meanwhile, in April 2020, the Central Bank reduced the Bank Rate, which is an administratively determined rate that could be used in periods of emergency, by 500 basis points from 15 per cent to 10 per cent.

Across the financial sector, several measures have been undertaken to ease the burden on businesses and individuals arising from the outbreak and containment measures. A wide ranging debt moratorium has been announced for the tourism, plantation, IT and apparel sectors, related logistics providers and small and medium scale enterprises. These businesses are also to receive working capital loans and investment purpose loans at concessional rates. Moratoria have also been granted on leasing loans for three wheelers, small value personal banking and leasing loans. In addition, financial institutions have been requested to reschedule non performing loans. To facilitate the provision of these concessions, lower capital conservation buffer requirements and a relaxation of loan classification rules have been announced, in addition to the availability of liquidity at reduced interest rates. Other key initiatives that were undertaken include the introduction of the ‘Saubagya COVID-19 Renaissance Facility’, which provides working capital for adversely affected businesses to revive their activities. Sub loans are to be released to farmers through licensed banks under the subsidised ‘New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme’.

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

In addition, measures have been introduced to reduce the pressure on the balance of payments (BOP) and the exchange rate. Accordingly, directions were issued to licensed banks to suspend the facilitation of importation of several categories of motor vehicles and other non essential goods. Several measures have also been introduced to restrict capital flows temporarily, through the suspension of outward investment and a prohibition on the purchase of Sri Lankan sovereign bonds by commercial banks. Further, a ‘Special Deposit Account’ has been introduced with the view of facilitating the inflow of foreign currency deposits from Sri Lankans living abroad and well wishers.

Meanwhile, the government announced several relief measures for businesses and individuals during March 2020, in addition to the previously announced significant tax concessions to businesses and individuals following the Presidential Elections with a view to reviving the subdued level of economic activity. These recent measures include various concessions for businesses engaged in the tourism, apparel, and wholesale and retail trade sectors, the introduction of maximum retail prices for selected essential food items and certain medical items, and a cash grant of Rs. 5,000 as a lump sum payment for low income and vulnerable families and individuals. Further, the Agrahara insurance benefits were doubled for all health, police and civil defence employees, and all government servants engaged in controlling the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. Meanwhile, the government initiated several measures on an urgent basis to ensure the availability of required funds for virus combating efforts, while also ensuring liquidity for businesses affected by long overdue payments. Such measures included allocations for settling payment arrears of small and medium scale contractors and to private institutions on account of purchasing of pharmaceuticals, and for settling procurement bills for fertiliser purchases. Further, the government allocated an additional Rs. 500 million

for preventive measures of the pandemic. A COVID-19 Healthcare and Social Security Fund was set up to help the provision of the necessary healthcare and relief measures, and a special bank account was opened by the President’s Fund, in which Rs. 100 million was initially deposited to be utilised for tasks related to preventing the spread of the pandemic. The government also established a fuel price stabilisation fund, aimed at raising a sum of about Rs. 200 billion within a period of 6 months, benefiting from the significantly low petroleum prices in the international markets. With due consideration to the burden of Value Added Tax (VAT) on firms, a grace period was granted until April 30 for payment of VAT accruing to February and March 2020. In spite of the limited fiscal space available to the government, the spaces built up in the monetary policy sphere, in terms of maintaining low inflation, and in the financial sector sphere, in terms of maintaining capital and liquidity buffers above industry norms, enabled the Central Bank to support the efforts of the government to implement the relief measures outlined above, while providing direct financing to the government, considering national interest.

Outlook

The nature of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is such that its impact on the performance of the Sri Lankan economy hinges on several uncertain factors. These include the further spread of the pandemic, the intensity and efficiency of mitigation measures, the degree of supply disruptions, and the persistence of behavioural changes and other economic patterns, relevant to both the domestic and global economies. Although the recovery of global economic activity is likely to be a slow process, measures to achieve normalcy in domestic economic activities could enable Sri Lanka to record a faster recovery, as domestic demand accounts for a significant portion of aggregate demand in Sri Lanka.

Bank was addressed by injecting liquidity to the

domestic money market on a permanent basis

through outright purchases of Treasury bonds

from the secondary market. In the domestic foreign

exchange market, the Sri Lankan rupee appreciated

marginally in 2019 supported by major inflows to the

financial account including the issuances of ISBs,

despite the short lived pressure on the exchange

rate following the Easter Sunday attacks and

outflows from the government securities market.

The CSE recorded a mixed performance during

2019 amidst adverse developments observed

in the domestic and global environment. The

CSE recorded improvements in terms of market

capitalisation, price earnings ratio (PER) and

overall share prices, while net foreign outflows from

the CSE continued during 2019, albeit at a slower

pace compared to 2018. Meanwhile, operations

of the payments and settlement systems of the

country were maintained orderly during the year

without major disruptions and concerns over safety

of the payments and settlement infrastructure,

and steps were taken to actively promote digital

payment means in the country. In consideration

24

1

of disruptions to financial market activities arising

from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Central Bank

took several steps to maintain adequate liquidity

in domestic financial markets, while ensuring

the availability of currency as well as all other

payments and settlement systems. Measures were

taken by the government and the Central Bank with

the assistance of the financial sector to ease the

difficulties faced by businesses and the general

public due to the ongoing disruptions to economic

activity, and necessary action is also being taken

to ensure stability and soundness of the financial

system during this challenging period.

1.3 Global Economic Environment and Outlook

Global economic growth slowed in 2019,

compared to 2018, reflecting the impact of

heightened trade tensions among the major

economies, geopolitical tensions and dampened

domestic demand in key emerging market

economies. According to the World Economic

Outlook (WEO) of the IMF, released in April 2020,

global economic growth in 2019 was lower at 2.9 per

cent, compared to 3.6 per cent in 2018. Growth in

advanced economies was estimated at 1.7 per cent in

2019, compared to 2.2 per cent in the previous year,

reflecting subdued growth in the United States and the

Euro area, despite the improved growth performance

in economies such as the United Kingdom and Japan.

Meanwhile, growth across emerging market and

developing economies moderated to 3.7 per cent in

2019 from 4.5 per cent in 2018, largely due to country

specific shocks that weighed on domestic demand.

Among key emerging economies, the moderation

of growth of China, India, Russia and Brazil was

noteworthy in 2019 over the previous year. Reflecting

subdued economic activity across the globe, growth

of world trade volume of merchandise and trade in

services moderated notably in 2019 to 0.9 per cent

in comparison to the growth of 3.8 per cent in 2018.

As trade and manufacturing slowed significantly,

commodity prices showed a significant drop in 2019,

as reflected in the decline in petroleum prices by

10.2 per cent in 2019, compared to the acceleration

by 29.4 per cent in 2018. Supported by low energy

prices and subpar activity, consumer price inflation in

advanced economies decelerated to 1.4 per cent in

2019, from 2.0 per cent in 2018. However, consumer

price inflation in emerging market and developing

economies accelerated marginally to 5.0 per cent in

2019, compared to 4.8 per cent in 2018, reflecting

the impact of supply side disruptions, despite the

muted demand pressures witnessed across these

economies.

The global economy, which had been on

an arduous path of recovery amidst gathering

economic and political headwinds, showed

signs of a far reaching setback with the COVID-19

pandemic. The April 2020 WEO of the IMF forecast

the global economy in 2020 to experience its worst

recession since the Great Depression, dwarfing the

Global Financial Crisis in 2007/08. The period of

‘the Great Lockdown’ resulting from the COVID-19

pandemic is likely to entail a substantial shrinkage

of global growth in 2020, followed by a partial

recovery in 2021. Accordingly, global growth is

projected to contract by 3.0 per cent in 2020,

followed by an expansion of 5.8 per cent in 2021.

This reflects a notable departure from the January

2020 WEO update of the IMF, wherein the global

economy was projected to grow by 3.3 per cent

and 3.4 per cent, respectively, in 2020 and 2021.

The growth in Advanced Economies is expected

to contract by 6.1 per cent in 2020, led by a

contraction in most economies including the United

States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany,

France, Italy, and Spain. The emerging market

and developing economies are expected to suffer

from the health crisis as well as the severe external

25

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

demand shock and tightening of global financial

conditions. Accordingly, the growth in emerging

market and developing economies is expected to

contract by 1.0 per cent in 2020. Notably, Emerging

Asia is the only region that is expected to record a

positive growth of 1.0 per cent in 2020, despite the

downward revision from 5.8 per cent in the January

update of the WEO. Economies in this group such

as China, India, and Thailand are expected to grow

moderately in 2020. Meanwhile, the expectations of

improved economic prospects in 2020, prior to the

COVID-19 outbreak, drove up commodity prices,

including petroleum. However, this trend reversed

dramatically in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic,

as containment measures caused a sharp decline

in global industrial activity.

While several key economies had begun

to adopt an accommodative monetary policy

stance from mid 2019 amidst escalating trade

tensions, the spillover effects of the COVID-19

outbreak have warranted a more rapid pace of

monetary policy easing alongside increasingly

important fiscal stimulus. Having reduced

the federal funds rate target range by a half of a

percentage point between the scheduled Federal

Open Market Committee meetings in early March

(the first such emergency move since the Global

Financial Crisis in 2007/08), the Federal Reserve

of the United States proceeded to a percentage

point cut to bring the federal funds rate target

range to 0.0 per cent to 0.25 per cent. The Federal

Reserve acknowledged that the COVID-19

pandemic brought new risks and challenges to the

economic outlook and noted that the rate was to be

maintained until it was confident that the economy

had weathered the recent events. The Federal

Reserve also announced several new measures

to support the flow of credit to households and

businesses. Meanwhile, the People’s Bank of

China (PBOC) reduced both its benchmark lending

rate, the Loan Prime Rate, and its medium term

lending rate by 30 basis points. While announcing

specific policy measures to support businesses

affected by the outbreak, the PBOC also reduced

the reserve requirements for certain banks to

enable the flow of credit to micro businesses and

other vulnerable sections of the economy while

injecting liquidity at lower rates to ensure smooth

functioning of the banking system. The European

Central Bank (ECB) launched Targeted Longer

Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO-III) to

support bank lending to firms and households, and

the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme

(PEPP) to purchase private and public sector

securities to counter significant risks to the

monetary policy transmission mechanism, and

recently adopted a package of temporary collateral

easing measures to facilitate participation in

liquidity providing operations. The Bank of Japan

(BOJ) adopted monetary easing measures to

safeguard sentiments and maintain stability in

financial markets. Since the onset of the pandemic,

the Reserve Bank of Australia also lowered its

benchmark rate in two cuts to a historically low

level of 0.25 per cent, directly citing the significant

effect of the virus on the economy, which is highly

dependent on economic activity in China. In

addition to several targeted relief measures, the

Bank Negara Malaysia reduced the Overnight

Policy Rate by 50 basis points to 2.50 per cent

and reduced the statutory reserve requirement

ratio by 1 percentage point with due consideration

to weakened global economic conditions and

disruptions to economic activity within the region.

Other regional central banks such as the Reserve

Bank of India reduced its policy repo rate by 75 basis

points to 4.40 per cent and the reverse repo rate by

115 basis points to 3.75 per cent thus far in 2020,

and announced that the accommodative stance

was to be maintained for as long as necessary

to revive the economy and mitigate the impact of

the COVID-19 pandemic. The Bangko Sentral Ng

Pilipinas reduced its overnight reverse repo rate by

125 basis points across three cuts to 2.75 per cent

so far in 2020, alongside a temporary relaxation of

regulations on banks and a reduction of reserve

requirement by 2 percentage points. Meanwhile, the

Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of

Japan, the European Central Bank, the US Federal

Reserve and the Swiss National Bank announced

coordinated action to enhance the provision of

liquidity through standing US dollar liquidity swap

line arrangements. These are expected to serve

as key liquidity backstops to ease strains in global

funding markets and thereby to help curb the

effects of any such strains on the supply of credit

to households and businesses across the world.

There is a wide policy consensus that monetary

policy will need to remain accommodative to ensure

that long term interest rates remain low. While

most key economies possess policy space for

accommodation, economies with negative interest

rates, such as the euro area and Japan, will need

to continue undertaking unconventional monetary

policy measures to address the challenges of

subpar growth and undershooting of inflation. The

low interest rate environment can also pave way

for active intervention of fiscal policy to strengthen

near term demand. Fiscal measures are likely to

be more effective in directly addressing short term

vulnerabilities faced by households, who may be

facing employment related losses, and those of

firms who face an abrupt reduction in demand.

As several advanced economies have already

committed to undertaking some discretionary

fiscal easing, additional measures may be adopted

without impacting the debt sustainability concerns.

Despite fiscal fragilities in emerging market

economies, social transfers to low income groups

and support for investment will need to continue

to prevent negative macroeconomic effects from

translating into economic imbalances with political,

economic and social implications. Meanwhile, the

global community, including multilateral financial

institutions, is expected to boost concessionary

financing and provide other relief, such as debt

moratoria and debt restructuring, for low income

economies as well as other vulnerable economies

to enable such economies to weather the impact of

the pandemic and facilitate meeting growing fiscal

needs for medical purposes and strengthening

social safety nets.

There are significant downside risks to

the global growth momentum. The substantial

amount of uncertainty that surrounds the pandemic

across several aspects ranging from the intensity

of the spread to containment efforts and their

repercussions and the likelihood of permanent

changes in sentiments and behaviour, make it

difficult to ascertain the degree of the economic

fallout. Despite the substantial downgrade to

global growth, risks to the outlook are also on the

downside. Key risks include a more persistent

27

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

pandemic and thereby effecting a long lasting

impact on economic activity and financial markets.

There is also the concern of a ‘second wave’

of an outbreak as the virus may again spread

from residual clusters in the event of a hastened

withdrawal of containment measures. It may also

stem from imported cases. Hence, the recovery

may be hampered due to both the persistent and

staggered nature of outbreaks, which could imply

persistent disruptions. There is also a concern

that despite the slowdown in the spread of the

virus, it may have long lasting implications such

as persistent uncertainty about the contagion, lack

of sufficient and timely restoration of business

confidence, structural shifts in the behaviour of

households and firms, all of which may culminate

in more lasting disruptions to supply chains and

denting of aggregate demand. The weak global

demand alongside low oil prices are likely to

result in a softening of inflation in the near term,

although the current undertaking of increased

liquidity support, fiscal stimulus and social safety

measures could cause inflationary pressures with

the abating of the pandemic and a shift recovery

in demand. Risks related to oil prices are tilted

to the downside in the near term as producers

face storage constraints due to the accumulation

of stocks in the wake of poor demand. Over the

medium term, the risks are balanced with upside

risks including faster containment of the pandemic

and a strengthening of the OPEC+ deal. However,

a key downside risk could be the rapid slowdown

in global economic activity alongside a collapse

of the OPEC+ coalition. Investor risk aversion in

the wake of the rapid spread of the virus caused a

capital outflow from emerging market economies,

and the magnitude of such outflows is expected

to be higher than that observed during the Global

Financial Crisis of 2007/08. At times of such

heightened global risks, the difficulty in mobilising

dollar financing could lead to a self fulfilling

prophecy of a decline in capital inflows, followed

by a sharp currency depreciation, which could

drive further capital flow reversals.

While Sri Lanka has been able to curb a major

spread of the COVID-19 outbreak in the country,

the interconnected nature of the global economy

will result in Sri Lanka experiencing spillover

effects of the pandemic. Sri Lanka has had long

standing economic linkages with China, where the

virus spread began in the latter part of 2019. Hence,

the downturn in the Chinese economy is expected

to have a significant impact on Sri Lanka across

several sectors such as tourism, construction, and

apparel in the near term. The reduction in global

tourist movements as a result of the widespread

nature of the outbreak can negatively affect value

chains in the domestic tourism industry, including

food, beverages and transport. However, some

benefits may also be realised from the weak global

demand translating into lower commodity prices,

as reflected in recent oil price movements. Further,

it is also noteworthy that Sri Lanka may be able

to benefit from the increasingly accommodative

monetary policy stance globally, which may

translate into lower financing costs. In spite of

such expectations however, the rise in emerging

market sovereign bond yields amidst the flight of

capital towards liquidity and quality, will remain

a key concern. Despite already implemented

proactive policy measures to contain the pandemic

while sustaining the economy, policymakers will

need to be continuously vigilant of developments

and closely monitor incoming data. Targeted and

forward looking policy interventions will need to

be undertaken with due consideration to both the

near term and medium term, in a proactive manner

to sustain the growth trajectory of the Sri Lankan

economy amidst the current challenging external

environment.

1.4 Medium Term Macroeconomic Outlook

The Sri Lankan economy, which

commenced the year 2020 with improved

business confidence, is expected to have

recorded a pickup in activity in the first two

months, until the global and domestic spread

of the COVID-19 pandemic severely affected

businesses and individuals alike. Although

a notable contraction in the global economy is

predicted, the magnitude of the near term economic

impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains

largely country specific as it would depend on how

quickly and effectively governments worldwide

take remedial measures to manage the outbreak.

Sri Lanka also remains vulnerable to the direct

and spillover effects of the COVID-19 outbreak

in the near term, as steps taken to ensure social

distancing and thereby curbing the spread of the

virus, are likely to have significant implications on

economic activities. Proactive measures taken

by the government from the initial stages of the

outbreak showed promising outcomes in terms of

containing the spread to a great extent, compared

to the experience of many other countries. The

relief measures announced by the government

and the Central Bank are expected to ease the

burden on businesses and individuals affected

by this outbreak. Although this is an evolving

situation with a high degree of uncertainty on

global and domestic economic outcomes and

policy responses, a baseline scenario where

domestic economic activity gradually picks up

from the end of the second quarter of 2020 and

global economic activity gathers pace from the

fourth quarter of the year is used for the purpose

of macroeconomic projections. Accordingly, it is

assumed that social distancing measures imposed

locally would have been relaxed to a great extent

by the end of the second quarter, enabling a mild

recovery in domestic economic activity in the third

quarter of the year. This would be followed by

a return to normalcy in most domestic activities

in the fourth quarter of the year, supported by

the fiscal and monetary stimulus measures

that are already in place, and some recovery in

outward oriented industries such as tourism,

export oriented manufacturing, etc., as the global

economic conditions improve. Accordingly, the

near term risks posed by the COVID-19 outbreak

are not expected to have a significant impact on

the medium term outlook of the economy, with

appropriate measures to implement policies to

promote sustained growth and improve resilience

of the economy.

Based on the assumptions described

above, annual real economic growth is

projected to decelerate further in 2020, before

rebounding thereafter towards the envisaged

higher growth path. The envisaged growth path

is contingent on the effective implementation of

the government’s policy agenda, maintaining

macroeconomic stability, addressing the structural

issues that constrain sustained growth, and a

revival in the global economy in the medium

term. The direct and indirect tax relief measures

introduced in late 2019 and early 2020 are

expected to increase the purchasing power of

individuals, and encourage domestic investment.

Lower nominal and real interest rates will also

boost private investment, providing impetus for

economic growth. Increased government attention

on the agriculture sector is expected to promote

value addition in the sector, enhance markets for

agriculture commodities, and enable farmers to

build entrepreneurial skills, thereby ensuring high

levels of income for those engaged in agriculture

and related activities. Meanwhile, the industry

29

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

sector is expected to rebound in the medium

term owing to the growth in the manufacturing

sector supported by the expected increase in

domestic demand and the gradual recovery in

the global economy. The government’s plans

to secure investment for the Port City project

and implement the highway development

projects could revive investment in the medium

term. These infrastructure projects will boost

construction activities, enhancing value addition

in the industry sector. Meanwhile, the increased

purchasing power of households is envisaged to

support the services sector, particularly wholesale

and retail trade, accommodation, food and

beverages, transportation, telecommunication

and financial services subsectors. As domestic

demand is insufficient to sustain high economic

growth, measures are expected to support the

expansion of merchandise and services exports

in the medium term, in spite of the possible near

term setback in these sectors due to sluggish

global economic performance with the impact of

the COVID-19 pandemic. The stimulus provided

by fiscal and monetary policy measures should

be accompanied by policy reforms to address

the structural issues in the economy, particularly

in the energy sector, as well as labour, land and

capital markets. It is only with structural reforms

that the country will be able to push its production

boundaries further and sustain high economic

growth without overheating the economy.

The outlook for the external sector is

expected to improve over the medium term,

despite the near term impact on the BOP from

the COVID-19 outbreak. A significant decline

in merchandise exports is likely, particularly to

Sri Lanka’s key export destinations of Europe

and the United States. In particular, exports of

textiles and garments, other industrial products

and commodities including tea and rubber, are

likely to experience a decline in the near term.

However, with reduced expenditure on crude oil

imports, a reduction in investment goods imports,

a reduction in export related raw material imports,

and the reduction in the imports of motor vehicles

and other non essential consumer goods due to the

policy measures in place, a significant reduction in

expenditure on imports is also expected. These

developments are likely to result in a decline in

the trade gap in 2020, before expanding thereafter

with the normalisation of economic activity.

The restoration of normal trade patterns, along

with conducive external trade policies, strong

institutional support, a flexible and competitive

exchange rate and enhancement of trade relations

with new trading partners, is expected to support

the growth momentum of the export sector over the

medium term. Imports are also projected to increase

over the medium term with the pickup in imports

of intermediate and investment goods, supporting

medium term growth prospects. The tourism sector

will be impacted significantly in the near term by

the COVID-19 outbreak with reduced global travel

affecting the industry and its supply chains. This,

together with reduced air and freight transportation

services, could moderate the surplus in the services

account in the near term. Over the medium term

however, the improvement of the surplus in the

services account is expected to strengthen the

current account. Inflows to the services account

are expected to augment particularly on account

of tourism, Information Technology (IT), Business

Process Outsourcing (BPO) and transport

services. A notable improvement is expected in

earnings from tourism over the medium term with

aggressive and coordinated tourism promotion

initiatives by the authorities, expected new FDI

to the hotel sector as well as the tourism related

developments in the Colombo Port City. The deficit

in the primary income account is expected to widen,

due to the increasing interest payments on account

of government borrowings from foreign sources.

Workers’ remittances are also likely to be impacted

with low international oil prices as well as the

direct impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the key

sources of workers’ remittances to Sri Lanka, such

as South Korea and Italy. The growth in workers’

remittances is expected to remain subdued over the

medium term with improved domestic employment

opportunities, geopolitical developments in the

Middle East and the government initiatives to

discourage semi and unskilled migration. These

developments are expected to widen the external

current account deficit in the near term, requiring

more than envisaged foreign financing at a time when

global financial markets are also in a turmoil due

to the outbreak. Accordingly, the financial account

is likely to be impacted, affecting the international

reserves to some extent in the near term, although

reserve adequacy is expected to be maintained at

satisfactory levels. The external current account

deficit would gradually adjust towards sustainable

levels and the financial account is expected to

receive sizable flows over the medium term. A

flexible and competitive exchange rate is expected

to be maintained amidst the expected adjustment

in the current account deficit. These developments

would reinforce international reserves in the

medium term. However, Sri Lanka’s external debt

position, in nominal terms, is projected to increase

amidst the large refinancing requirements as well

31

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

as future deficits in the external current account

and the government budget deficit. However,

the expected expansion in the economy over the

medium term is likely to ease the country’s external

debt position.

The medium term fiscal outlook is expected

to focus on further strengthening fiscal

consolidation, by reducing the budget deficit

and public debt to sustainable levels, while

supporting the medium term development

objectives and enhancing the living standards

of the people. The government announced a

series of tax concessions aimed at reviving subpar

economic activity exacerbated by the impact

of Easter Sunday attacks and the COVID-19

outbreak. While such tax concessions could

have a negative impact on government revenue

collection in the near term, the positive spillovers

into aggregate demand resulting from the expected

rebound of investment and consumption could

raise government revenue over the medium term.

Further, the government intends to rationalise

expenditure by eliminating unproductive spending,

while better targeting public investment, over the

medium term. Consequently, the budget deficit is

projected to decline below 5.0 per cent of GDP

by 2024, supported by a gradual reduction in the

current account deficit and an improvement in

the primary balance to record a surplus over the

medium term. With such improvements in major

fiscal balances, the outstanding central government

debt to GDP ratio is expected to decline over

the medium term. Meanwhile, effective use of

active liability management operations would

help smoothen debt service obligations over the

medium term and prevent debt dynamics falling

into unsustainable levels, while the Medium Term

Debt Management Strategy (MTDS) would guide

the reduction in the central government debt,

especially its exposure to foreign debt over the

medium term. However, the expected slowdown

in activity domestically and globally amidst the

COVID-19 outbreak could pose challenges in the

short term in achieving the envisaged targets, as the

government is likely to incur increased expenditure

on strengthening healthcare facilities and providing

other relief measures to the economy. Looking

beyond these near term challenges, the envisaged

fiscal consolidation would depend largely on the

government’s commitment to adhere to stringent

and binding fiscal rules over the medium term.

Inflation is expected to be maintained within

the 4-6 per cent range over the medium term with

well anchored inflation expectations supported

by proactive monetary policy measures taken

by the Central Bank under a flexible inflation

targeting framework. The fallout of the spread

of COVID-19 could adversely affect aggregate

demand in the near term, thereby exerting

downward pressure on inflation. Further, the decline

in commodity prices, especially international

oil prices, due to the impact of the pandemic

and geopolitical tensions, could lower costs of

production, thereby easing inflationary pressures

over the medium term. On the other hand, possible

supply constraints domestically and globally due

to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic could

exert pressure on domestic prices in the near

term. On balance, inflation is expected to remain

within the desired mid single digit range over the

medium term with appropriate policy adjustments.

Proactive policy measures under flexible inflation

targeting are expected for the continued anchoring

of private sector inflation expectations at desired

levels while exchange rate flexibility is expected to

be maintained to increase the economy’s resilience

to external shocks. Continuation of the fiscal

consolidation process is imperative to successfully

32

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

1

manage inflation as well as inflation expectations at

desired levels, while the support of the government

is also required to minimise transitory volatilities

in inflation emanating from supply side factors.

The Central Bank would ensure adequate money

and credit flows to the economy to support the

envisaged growth path over the medium term.

Amidst the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak,

growth of credit to the private sector is expected

to remain low in the near term due to significant

disruptions to economic activity. However, as the

country recovers from the COVID-19 outbreak, the

growth of credit to the private sector is projected

to accelerate, supported by low market lending

rates, the expected expansion in economic activity

buttressed by fiscal and monetary stimulus,

the debt moratorium and special credit support

schemes offered for businesses, especially small

and medium enterprises (SMEs). Meanwhile, the

financial sector is expected to remain resilient

in the medium term, in spite of the near term

challenges due to the unfavourable developments

in the domestic and external environment amidst

the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

1.5 Issues and Policies

Similar to all other countries in the world,

Sri Lanka, at the time of preparing this report,

was in the midst of managing the spread of

the COVID-19 pandemic as well as its socio-

economic impact. The outbreak has resulted in an

unprecedented level of uncertainty on both global

and domestic economic fronts. Although the world

has experienced similar pandemics in history, for

most national and multilateral organisations that

are currently in existence, this situation is their

first experience in handling a humanitarian and

economic crisis of this magnitude. Unlike any other

global recessions including the great depression in

the 1930s, the projected recession caused by the

COVID-19 pandemic has to be tackled in a situation

where almost all economies across the globe are

in a lockdown and advocate social distancing, with

limited domestic and even smaller global trade and

other transactions. At present, the priority of national

authorities, including in Sri Lanka, is to contain the

public health crisis. However, once the situation is

condensed to a manageable level, it is essential

that measures are taken to revive economies from

the sharp downturn that they are experiencing at

present. In Sri Lanka, implementing urgent measures

to revive the economy is particularly important as it

has undergone several years of sluggish economic

growth, and the country’s capacity to withstand

further shocks is diminishing rapidly. While short

term measures to support a speedy recovery from

the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are being

implemented by the government, the Central Bank,

and other policymaking organisations in the country,

this section seeks to highlight longstanding structural

issues faced by the economy, which need to be

addressed to sustain equitable and high economic

growth and improve the overall wellbeing of the

population.

Increasing foreign debt servicing obligations

could pose risks to Sri Lanka’s macroeconomic

stability in the medium term, requiring urgent

measures to enhance the country’s foreign

exchange earnings continued with measures

to discourage excessive expenditure on

non essential imports. Following Sri Lanka’s

graduation to the middle income category as per

the IMF classification in 2010, the availability of

concessional foreign financing declined rapidly.

Moreover, Sri Lanka’s recent advancement to the

upper middle income country status is likely to

restrict access to concessional funding sources

further. The composition change in Sri Lanka’s

foreign debt profile with a shift to costlier commercial

33

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

borrowing from concessional borrowing requires

prudent management of the debt profile to ensure

external debt sustainability. Furthermore, annual

external debt repayment commitments falling due

in the medium term are projected to be around US

dollars 5 to 6 billion, on average. In this context, it

is envisaged that Sri Lanka would need to rollover

the existing debt by issuing ISBs and syndicated

loan facilities from international financial markets.

These commercial borrowings are generally

characterised by higher interest costs together

with relatively short maturities than concessional

sources. Rising foreign debt obligations could exert

pressure on international reserves, the exchange

rate and fiscal operations. In this context, along

with the active liability management framework, it is

vital that fiscal consolidation efforts are continued

through improved revenue mobilisation and

prudent spending while adopting sound fiscal rules

to ensure overall public debt sustainability as well

as external debt sustainability. Further revisions to

Sri Lanka’s Sovereign rating could result in raising

the cost of rolling over the increased commercial

debt stock in the period ahead.

Measures to strengthen fiscal consolidation

are essential over the medium term following

inevitable fiscal slippages in the near term

owing to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The fiscal stimulus programme, which included

measures announced in the aftermath of the Easter

Sunday attacks and following the Presidential

Election in November 2019, as well as on the onset

of the COVID-19 outbreak, offered significant tax

concessions, among others, in view of supporting

businesses and individuals affected by the

unforeseen events, while also aiming to revive

activity through increased private consumption and

investment over the near to medium term, thereby

raising government revenue in the period ahead.

While tax concessions help stimulate sluggish

economic activity over the medium term, any

adverse impact on tax revenue needs to be offset

by appropriate measures. Sri Lanka has grappled

with low levels of government revenue for decades

despite various reforms introduced from time to

time aimed at simplifying the tax structure and

strengthening revenue administration systems.

Thus, it is important that the intended benefits of

fiscal stimulus, which are heavily concentrated

on tax concessions, are transmitted efficiently

and effectively to intended economic participants

to revive activity in the near to medium term.

Effective management of government expenditure

becomes imperative to curtail the rapid growth of

recurrent expenditure while ensuring adequate

resources for public investment over the medium

term. Government expenditure, particularly of a

recurrent nature, could grow sharply in the period

ahead amidst fast growing expenses on interest

payments, salaries and wages, and subsidies

and transfers. While the government plans to

increase recruitment to the public sector partly

to address issues such as youth unemployment,

abject poverty, regional disparity etc., any large

scale recruitment to the public sector could

eventually result in a lasting impact on government

expenditure on account of salaries and wages and

pension payments, particularly in the context of the

non existence of a contributory pension scheme

for the public sector. This also underscores the

need for effective deployment of such workforce in

order to ensure that the productivity of the public

sector improves. Meanwhile, the rising recurrent

expenditure coupled with low government revenue

could narrow the fiscal space available for much

needed investment on health, and education

services and physical infrastructure development.

Curtailing public investment would result in

dampening economic growth over the medium

to long term. Thus, further emphasis is needed

to enhance public expenditure management in

34

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

1

order to ensure that government spending is cost

effective and yields positive growth dividends

by strengthening the governance measures of

public expenditure to eliminate any inefficient and

unproductive spending.

Enhancing domestic production and

increasing participation in regional and

global value chains (GVCs) are of paramount

importance in strengthening the export sector

performance of Sri Lanka amidst significant

volatility in prices of its exports of primary

commodities. Primary commodities continue

to be a substantial proportion of exports of many

emerging market and developing economies.

Sri Lanka is an exporter as well as an importer of

primary commodities, where commodities such

as agricultural and mineral products, accounted

for about 21 per cent of total export earnings

and about 15 per cent of import expenditure in

2019. A notable decline in global commodity

prices was observed in the recent past, reflecting

the impact of lower crude oil prices and the

moderation in global trade and overall economic

activity exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

As the heightened volatility in prices of primary

commodities could impact both export earnings

and import expenditure, many emerging market

and developing economies increasingly focus

on linking up with GVCs to diversify their export

products and markets. Meanwhile, trade tensions

among major trading nations could trigger a

substantial redrawing of supply chains across

Asia and the globe, creating challenges as well as

opportunities. During the recent past, well before

the COVID-19 pandemic, several major economies

moved towards protectionist trade policies, partially

ignoring the norms of the World Trade Organization

(WTO). Any escalation of trade disputes could

disrupt cross border production links and redraw

production networks and supply chains globally.

This could potentially be challenging for countries

like Sri Lanka, where a notable share of exports

is dependent on imported material. At the same

time, this could create opportunities, particularly

for countries in Asia, where certain supply chains

could relocate to South East Asia and South Asia.

Despite the availability of more disaggregated

value chains and production sharing networks, Sri

Lanka’s participation in GVCs remains minimal

due to factors such as the high cost of production

and low product development due to inadequate

public and private sector spending on research and

development (R&D). Thus, measures are needed

to overcome these inefficiencies and increase

value addition and productivity improvements for

Sri Lanka to benefit from GVCs. Consistent policies,

institutional support, a stable macroeconomic

environment, attracting FDI, R&D led innovation,

improved ease of doing business, and production

oriented financial support schemes are aspects that

could help secure successful entry into GVCs. With

appropriate measures to overcome the structural

issues in the manufacturing sector of the country,

merchandise trade can also be improved, thereby

supporting the persistent trade deficit for decades.

Further, efforts to enhance market access through

well negotiated new free trade agreements (FTAs)

and enhanced economic cooperation with existing

and new trading partners would also complement

the already identified reforms and strategies in

trade promotion.

Looking beyond the setbacks caused by

the Easter Sunday attacks and the COVID-19

pandemic, Sri Lanka’s tourism industry needs

to embrace new technology to promote and

sustain the industry over the medium term.

Although the tourism industry has grown notably

since the post conflict period from 0.7 million tourist

arrivals in 2010 to a peak of 2.3 million arrivals

in 2018, its potential remains largely unexplored.

35

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

For the tourism industry to reach its full carrying

capacity, measures are needed to address issues

such as clustered overcrowding, low quality

tourism infrastructure, and lack of attractions to

serve tourists of all ages. Some of these issues

can be addressed by introducing smart technology

and standardisation while making use of various

social media platforms, and impactful media

campaigns to attract and retain tourists. Moreover,

smart technology such as focused messaging,

an automated visa granting process and border

control, wi-fi based tour guiding techniques and

real time tourist traffic monitoring are some aspects

that could elevate the industry performance.

Information services at main tourist attractions

and transport hubs need to be improved for proper

guiding, increasing safety and, more importantly, to

prevent touting. Measures such as standardising

taxi services, improving public transport,

introducing tourists friendly tour guiding, ticketing

and advanced booking systems, and ensuring

clean sanitary facilities, could improve the image

of Sri Lanka as a safe, tourism friendly destination,

which offers good value for money.

The implementation of a comprehensive

national industrial policy with emphasis on

improving competitiveness and ensuring the

continuity of national policies are essential for

Sri Lanka to increase its growth potential. With

the successful implementation of industrial policy

measures at the inception of the development

process, countries such as Hong Kong, China,

South Korea, and Singapore have rapidly

transformed their economies to generate higher

gross value addition in the industry sector and

moved towards an advanced level of development.

However, industrial policy experiments carried out

by successive governments in Sri Lanka fell short of

producing positive and sustained outcomes, partly

due to the abandonment of such efforts before

the benefits were realised. Industrial activities

in Sri Lanka are dominated by four subsectors:

construction, mining and quarrying, manufacture

of food beverages and tobacco, and manufacture

of textiles, wearing apparel and leather products.

However, a large amount of such manufactured

goods is intended for the domestic market, except

for textiles and garments and a few consumer and

intermediate goods. Although some Sri Lankan

manufacturers in industries such as tea, rubber and

apparels were able to achieve global excellence

standards, Sri Lanka still lags behind its Asian

peers due to subdued performance in merchandise

exports. The low degree of diversification in industrial

production and industrial exports highlights the

sluggish progress in the manufacturing sector

compared to success stories from around the world.

Industries such as the capital goods sector largely

remains untouched. However, as Sri Lanka tends

to gradually lose the low cost labour advantage to

its competitors, the country needs to diversify its

industrial exports from labour intensive products to

more value added and technology driven products,

possibly niche product categories, in order to connect

with GVCs. These highlight the need to develop a

coherent industrial development strategy, coupled

with a trade regime that is capable of facilitating

businesses and promoting investment opportunities

and factor market reforms to cater to the needs of

identified industries. Many countries, which own a

well developed industry sector, began by identifying

priority industries within their industrial policy

agenda by considering factors such as high value

addition, potential for increasing export revenues,

employment generation, and minimising income

disparities in the country. The national industrial

policy needs to be formulated with due consultation

among all stakeholders to ensure consistency and

continuity of the industry development agenda,

irrespective of changes on the political front, as such

policies are likely to have long gestation periods.

36

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

The manufacturing sector of Sri Lanka is

affected by low productivity, resulting in slow

growth in the sector and low competitiveness

of Sri Lanka’s exports in global markets,

emphasising the need for improving the quality

of the workforce and increasing productivity

through R&D. Sri Lanka’s manufacturing sector

is dominated by labour intensive, low value

added products, which inevitably make it difficult

to achieve higher productivity levels. The rising

wage levels in the economy have resulted in a

deterioration in the low cost labour advantage over

competitors. As the space for increasing prices of

export goods is limited for Sri Lanka without losing

the market share due to competition, productivity

improvement in the manufacturing sector is

imperative to maintain competitiveness and provide

impetus to the economy’s take off with resilient and

sustainable economic growth. Increasing efficiency

of the production processes helps reduce unit

labour costs in the manufacturing sector by

means of adopting lean manufacturing processes,

improved product designs, standardisation,

elimination of overscheduling of labour using

demand predictive scheduling software and

utilising part time labour. Improving the quality of

the workforce by introducing necessary reforms at

all levels of the education system would help equip

workers with required technical skills and enhance

productivity. Currently, Sri Lanka’s expenditure on

R&D activities is negligible, resulting in a low level

of innovation in the economy. Hence, technology

related R&D activities in the industrial sector should

be supported by both government and private

sector spending on R&D while strengthening links

between R&D institutions, academic institutions,

civil society organisations, and the private sector

to commercialise inventions. Weak infrastructure

and bureaucratic inefficiencies generally result

in high costs to firms, reducing profitability and

discouraging private investment. Therefore, efforts

to improve infrastructure facilities such as the road

network and ports must continue while eliminating

procedural bottlenecks. Productivity improvements

in the manufacturing sector should be accompanied

with trade reforms as well as proactive policy

measures that attract FDI, in order to expand the

market for domestically manufactured goods.

In spite of Sri Lanka’s past achievements

in the areas of social and human capital

development, the graduation of the income

status of the economy brings a novel set of

challenges, which requires an assessment

of whether the labour force is sufficiently

equipped to facilitate a high and sustainable

growth trajectory. Given the rapid dynamism of the

domestic economy and international developments

driven by the fourth industrial revolution (4IR),

the education system lies at the epicentre of the

issues faced by the labour market. Education

policy must ensure that curricula are updated and

adapted periodically in line with the skill demands

of local and global labour markets. In Sri Lanka,

a large section of youth possesses neither higher

education nor any skill training. In addition, they do

not possess other marketable skills such as soft

skills, digital literacy and English literacy. These

create impediments to their access to high level

jobs that are in line with their aspirations. The lack

of accessibility to decent work opportunities in the

private sector results in the youth depending largely

on public sector employment. Graduates who

lack marketable skills find it worthwhile to remain

unemployed and queue for jobs in the public sector

that offer the long term benefits of job security and

financial security, in terms of pensions, over the

lifetime of the employee and their dependents. This

premium associated with public sector jobs will

continue to create distortions in the labour market

unless addressed through policy reforms. Such

policy reforms should ensure that public sector jobs

37

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

are not perceived as ‘handouts’, and pave way for

the appropriate recruitment of talented individuals

that will ensure the efficiency and productivity

of the sector. Further, the redesign of the Public

Service Pension Scheme to be contributory while

introducing a nationwide contributory pension

scheme can also reduce the attractiveness of

public sector jobs and allow greater flexibility in

the labour market. This will also be essential in

light of the increasingly ageing population and

the corresponding limited fiscal space. Another

shortcoming of the education sector is the poor

performance of students in the science, technology,

engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects

and the transcending impact of this on the output

of the university system. Equitable access to high

quality education, focusing on honing linguistic,

mathematical and technological competencies,

can not only pave the way for a more productive

human capital base but also address provincial

disparities. Targeted policy interventions need to

be undertaken to level out such irregularities so

that backward regions too can engage with and

benefit from the digital economy and associated

emerging technologies. In light of the low levels of

female LFPR, the stress associated with unpaid

care work is a critical issue for women. Although the

proliferation of the ‘platform’ and ‘gig’ economy can

contribute to the increase in women’s participation

in the labour force, the absence of formalised care

services will continue to hinder women, particularly

those with higher educational qualifications, from

being economically active. Further, the high level

of informality present in the Sri Lankan economy

also negatively weighs on women as a large share

of women workers is already engaged as unpaid

family labour. The ‘gig’ economy may aggravate

this, thereby excluding them, as well as the entire

informal sector workforce, from access to social

security and labour protection guarantees. As has

been discussed over several years, policymakers

need to urgently pursue initiatives and policies that

enable flexible work arrangements, improve the

availability of jobs in occupations that are preferred

by highly skilled women, provide better quality and

more affordable child care facilities, and improve

public transport services to increase female LFPR.

Inadequate warehousing facilities for

agriculture products and the lack of agriculture

commodity financing options have resulted

in sharp fluctuations in food prices and lower

farmgate prices for producers. A substantial

portion of the consumption basket considered for

inflation estimation consists of food items. Increased

volatility in food prices observed in recent years was

primarily due to the seasonality of production and

disruptions to supplies resulting from unfavourable

weather conditions. Limited storage and warehouse

facilities available for farmers deprive them of the

opportunity to store seasonal harvests and thereby

receive a better price for agriculture produce during

low supply periods. A common practice among

many farmers is to sell their harvest immediately

to settle loans obtained to finance expenditure

incurred in production and to purchase inputs for the

next crop cycle while fulfilling their own household

consumption needs. The small and medium scale

agriculture producers often grapple with a lack

of working capital due to inadequate collateral to

obtain loans from the formal financial institutions.

Immediate sale of the harvest results in production

gluts in the harvest season and shortages in other

times, causing disruptions to the food supply in

the country and a sharp volatility in food prices.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop

mechanisms to expand affordable, good quality

storage and warehousing facilities, especially cold

chain logistics, in order to systematically improve

the stability and quality of the food supply in the

market while improving stability in prices. Along

with such efforts, commodity financing options,

38

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

1

including warehouse receipts systems, should be

further popularised among farmers as a means to

use their produce as collateral to access financial

services. Commodity finance schemes are being

successfully implemented in various countries,

such as India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Kenya,

and Zambia, especially for cereals including

paddy and corn. Under the warehouse receipt

system, warehouse operators will issue receipts

certifying that particular commodities of stated

quality and quantity are placed at the warehouse

by a particular depositor and will hold the stored

commodity in safe custody while the depositor uses

the receipt as collateral to fulfil short term working

capital requirements. Good management practices

of warehouse operations must be ensured through

efficient supervision by a regulatory agency.

Commodity finance, coupled with good storage and

warehousing facilities, will ensure the availability of

agriculture produce throughout the year, enabling

farmers to realise better farmgate prices while

minimising sharp fluctuations in retail prices of food

items. Meanwhile, financial institutions could also

benefit from warehouse receipts because such

collateral is highly liquid, providing a high level

of protection in relation to credit granted to the

agriculture sector.

The progress of many infrastructure

development projects in sectors, such as

transport, water and electricity, has slowed

in recent years, despite their significance

in ensuring a faster and inclusive economic

growth. Such infrastructure is essential as inputs

in the value chains of other productive sectors.

Transportation, port and airport facilities and

information and communication technologies

provide economic and social opportunities to

economic agents resulting in positive multiplier

effects through better employment opportunities

and increased access to markets and finances.

Weaknesses in physical infrastructure, such as

interruptions in electricity, limited clean water

supply, and poor urban development and housing,

deteriorate the living conditions of people, thereby

affecting the health and education levels and long

run productivity of the labour force. Unavailability

of efficient and adequate infrastructure acts as an

obstacle for industrialisation, erodes the country’s

competitiveness and hampers FDI. There exists

a two way relationship between infrastructure

development and economic growth as demand for

quality infrastructure tends to rise in tandem with

the increasing income levels of households. Hence,

strengthening the infrastructure is imperative to

boost economic growth, while meeting the rising

demand for quality of the same. Since the end

of the internal conflict in 2009, the government

led infrastructure development drive significantly

enhanced transport and logistics facilities,

improving connectivity within the country and with

the rest of the world. However, this infrastructure

development drive has slowed in recent years due

to fiscal constraints and rising debt levels, among

several other economic and non economic reasons.

Considering the lack of fiscal space, private sector

engagement in infrastructure development needs to

be promoted by creating an investment conducive

environment by establishing consistent policies,

macroeconomic stability, proper regulatory and

quality assurance framework, and minimising

bureaucratic inefficiencies. Various funding

arrangements can be considered to attract private

investment for infrastructure development, such

as public private partnerships and investments

funds. Such projects generally require a large initial

investment and also carry long gestation periods

to receive economic benefits, thus limiting the

interest of private sector participation, and requiring

government intervention. Hence, prioritisation

of infrastructure development projects based on

their economic and social impact would enable the

39

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

government to use the limited public funding more

efficiently. Some infrastructure projects tend to

have negative externalities such as environmental

pollution and overuse of limited resources. Sri

Lanka needs to consider such negative externalities

of infrastructure projects in the process of project

prioritisation while seeking avenues of green

financing for environment friendly infrastructure

projects by strengthening green financing markets

and relevant regulatory frameworks.

Ensuring energy security through a

consistent policy on energy generation mix

and the timely implementation of the long

term generation expansion plan are crucial

to reduce the cost of power generation while

sustaining economic growth. Uninterrupted

electricity supply is one of the major elements that

determine productivity, and studies show that the

performance of a firm is negatively impacted by

weaknesses in electricity infrastructure, particularly

due to power outages. Poor electricity infrastructure

discourages investors, especially potential foreign

investors. As power outages are used to measure

the strength of infrastructure in the Ease of Doing

Business Index, frequent power disruptions, either

planned or unplanned, would result in a lower rank

in the Index. Power generation in Sri Lanka is often

hampered by frequent and prolonged dry weather

conditions, compelling the Ceylon Electricity

Board (CEB) to opt for load shedding schedules

occasionally. There has been no major addition to

the CEB’s generation capacity since 2014 due to

inconsistencies in policy decisions and drawbacks

in the implementation of the Generation Expansion

Plan of the CEB. The CEB continued to incur

losses in recent years, and such weak financial

performance of the CEB was aggravated by

regular emergency power purchases from the

private sector to cover generation shortfalls at

substantially high unit costs. For example, in

2019, the average generation cost per 1 kWh

of electricity at the selling point increased by

21.8 per cent compared to the preceding year.

The CEB’s continuous reliance on emergency

power purchases for several consecutive years

has resulted in uncompetitive purchasing prices,

reflecting weaknesses in the planning and

procurement processes of the energy sector. Thus,

accurate projections on electricity demand and

generation, and proper planning of procurements

in a cost effective manner are essential to reduce

the financial burden on the CEB, which has ripple

effects on the other sectors of the economy,

including the financial sector. Meanwhile, the

implementation of a national policy on energy

generation mix with a long term vision is important,

considering the financial aspects, as well as other

market and socio-economic and environmental

factors, in order to assure sustainability of the

energy sector and overall economic growth.

Underperforming SOBEs, which depend

largely on financial support from the

government, continue to burden the national

budget. In the post independence economy of

Sri Lanka, SOBEs have performed an important

role aiding the socio-economic growth and

development, including the growth of the industrial

sector and provision of infrastructure facilities.

However, due to the changes in policy orientation

of successive governments, the lack of adoptability

of some SOBEs amidst changing dynamics of

the domestic and global economy, managerial

issues and other interventions at various levels,

hindered the performance of many SOBEs over

time, thereby requiring assistance from the

government to sustain their operations, contrary

to the expectation of becoming an additional

source of revenue to the government. Against

this backdrop, introducing reforms in relation to

such SOBEs has become imperative in order to

40

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

1

ensure unobstructed delivery of public goods and

services, while eliminating additional pressure on

the government budget. While the recent efforts of

the government to appoint professionals to manage

SOBEs are commendable, further measures are

needed to improve the viability of the financially

constrained SOBEs by introducing cost reflective

pricing mechanisms in the provision of public

utilities on a selective basis, improving corporate

governance and rationalising recruitments to

improve the productivity of the workforce. Also,

except in the areas where the intervention of the

government in the market through SOBEs is due

to the existence of natural monopolies, enhancing

private sector participation in public utility provision

must be encouraged in order to improve the overall

efficiency of service provision through competition.

Water security has become a serious

concern in Sri Lanka amidst erratic weather

patterns and increasing demand for water,

prompting the need for urgent implementation

of improved water management strategies

including drip irrigation systems and rain

water harvesting techniques. The mean annual

average rainfall of the country is around 2,000 mm,

which is higher than the average rainfall received

by most water stressed countries. However, the

average rainfall statistics of the country mask the

spatial and temporal water scarcity issues that arise

mainly due to the bi-monsoonal rainfall pattern.

The country’s dry zone, which covers more than 60

per cent of the land area, is prone to water scarcity

with a mean annual average rainfall of less than

1,750 mm, with distinct dry periods prevailing from

May to September each year. Further, abnormal

weather patterns, which can be attributed to

the effects of climate change, have resulted in

prolonged dry spells in certain areas while intense

rainfall has caused floods in some other areas

during the same time of the year. Such erratic

patterns in rainfall often disrupt the continuous

supply of natural water sources, potentially

threatening the water security in the country unless

addressed promptly, particularly amidst the rising

demand for water in the period ahead. Short

supply of safe drinking water is not an issue limited

to the dry zone, but also an issue in certain wet

zone areas given the rapid pace of urbanisation.

Agriculture is the largest water consuming activity

in the country, while the demand for water for

other activities, such as household consumption,

industrial activities and hydropower generation,

is also on the rise. Meanwhile, the heavy use of

agrochemicals and fertiliser has resulted in ground

water pollution in certain areas of the country.

Under such circumstances, efficient management

of water resources becomes vital. As indicated

by the mean annual average rainfall statistics,

the primary reason for water scarcity is not the

limited supply but the suboptimal management

of the available water resources. For instance,

about one half of the precipitation received by the

country flows into the sea without being utilised for

any productive activity. Estimates indicate that the

relatively large rivers such as Gin, Kelani and Kalu

release about 60 to 70 per cent of its water to the

sea, while the relatively small rivers such as Kala

Oya, Yan Oya, and Malawathu Oya release about

20 per cent of its water to the sea. Therefore, a well

coordinated comprehensive water management

policy needs to be implemented with the support

of all stakeholders to ensure that water resources

are better preserved, and water security in the

country is safeguarded. Further, priority needs to

be extended to the better management of river

basins, especially by constructing reservoirs

towards the middle of river basins in addition

to the upper regions, while measures such as

de-silting of existing reservoirs to increase the

water retention capacity, promotion of water

efficient farming techniques such as drip irrigation

41

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

methods, popularisation of good agricultural

practices among the farming communities, and

introduction of rainwater harvesting practices

could also prove useful. Further, the techniques of

rainwater harvesting could be promoted not only

in water scarce areas such as the dry zone, but

also in urban regions, by way of rooftop rainwater

harvesting tanks. Such methods, if adopted

adequately, will significantly reduce the purified

water usage for non drinking purposes, thereby

allowing the diversion of excess water into areas

where people are deprived of clean drinking water.

Sri Lanka’s vulnerability to climate change

risks seems to be rising rapidly, causing a

significant burden on the government budget.

While the increased incidence of natural disasters

causes a direct financial burden on the government

on reconstruction and rehabilitation, they also create

numerous socio-economic issues, including the

worsening of poverty levels, necessitating further

fiscal intervention. Hence, such consequences

associated with climate change risks need to

be addressed by introducing reforms, such as

environmental tax reforms, which could reap a triple

dividend by lowering pollution, raising public social

welfare, while generating positive externalities.

Meanwhile, financial institutions should actively

consider pursuing green finance initiatives that

support environment friendly, sustainable business

models, while offering products for businesses and

individuals to protect themselves from climate risks

from a financial perspective.

Price pressures caused by frequent supply

side disruptions could weigh on the Central

Bank’s efforts to maintain low and stable

inflation. The Central Bank’s flexible inflation

targeting based monetary framework aims at

stabilising inflation in mid single digit levels over

the medium term while supporting economic

growth. Although the Central Bank’s efforts to

anchor inflation expectations and manage demand

conditions helped stabilise inflation in single digit

levels for a sustained period of over a decade,

headline inflation in certain periods exhibited

increased volatility reflecting the impact of domestic

supply side shocks. As in many emerging market

and developing economies, the consumption

basket in Sri Lanka contains a large share of food

and nonalcoholic beverages. As a result, volatility of

food inflation could cause high volatility in headline

inflation. In general, supply side pressures, driven

by weather related and other disturbances, as well

as large swings in global commodity and food prices,

contribute to high volatility of food inflation in Sri

Lanka. Central banks do not possess instruments

to tackle food inflation, and attempting to arrest

transitory volatilities in food inflation using monetary

policy could have adverse consequences on the

economy. However, frequent high food inflation

could lead to second round effects on inflation and

raise inflation expectations. Therefore, fiscal policy

support is required to help stabilise food inflation

in an economy. While the government’s direct

intervention in markets through taxes and tariffs,

price ceilings, etc., helps address short term supply

side concerns, policy reforms to improve efficiency

by enhancing storage, transportation and waste

reduction allow long term solutions to mitigate the

effects of supply side disruptions in a sustainable

manner. In the medium to long term, fiscal policy

could encourage the usage of new technologies

to increase the resilience to shocks. This often

includes the introduction of climate resistant crops,

introduction of new storage and food preservation

methods, which help minimise wastage of food

supplies, increased use of information technology

based price discoveries and cultivation information

dissemination to control food price fluctuations,

while enhancing the efficiency of allocation of

inputs and resources.

Undue delays in the monetary transmission

process continue to hinder the efficiency in the

passthrough of monetary policy measures to the

real economy. The impact of monetary policy action

is transmitted to the economy via various channels

such as the interest rate, amount of credit, exchange

rate, asset price, etc., with a time lag. In Sri Lanka,

the interest rate channel acts as the key monetary

policy transmission channel, where changes in

policy interest rates of the Central Bank passthrough

to medium to long term market interest rates via

short term money market interest rates. However,

undue transmission lags reflect imperfections in the

transmission mechanism due to various issues such

as the rigidity in the liability side of balance sheets

of financial institutions, unhealthy competition in the

financial sector, deterioration of credit quality, high

taxes in the financial sector and a relatively large

share of informal sector in the economy. The rigidity

in the liability side of the balance sheets of financial

institutions creates delays in the transmission

process when a large portion of deposits is priced

at fixed interest rates, while unhealthy practices

among financial institutions in deposit mobilisation

could further delay the passthrough of monetary

policy actions. Further, deterioration of credit

quality implies relatively high level of NPLs, and

the need for increased provisioning could result

in rising costs of loanable funds of the financial

system, which may be counterproductive to

monetary policy measures. Relatively high taxes

on financial intermediaries remained a significant

concern, impacting the interest margin of financial

institutions and cost of funds, thereby hindering the

performance of the financial sector. The measures

introduced by the government recently to reduce

taxes on the financial sector have helped address

these concerns to a great extent. Meanwhile, the

relatively large share of the informal financial sector

could weaken the efficacy of monetary policy and its

passthrough to the economy. Additionally, fulfilment

of the government’s financing requirement largely

through the banking sector and banks’ preference

to invest more in government securities could also

hinder the efficiency of the passthrough of monetary

policy measures. In addition to these structural

issues, subdued economic activity which dampens

the demand for credit interactively, could also limit

the degree of passthrough of monetary policy

measures. These imperfections in the monetary

policy transmission mechanism could be costly,

particularly when the Central Bank attempts to revive

the economy from conditions of persistent subdued

levels of activity.

As Sri Lanka transitions to a low interest

rate regime, the introduction of new financial

products with a reasonable return becomes vital

in order to ensure the living standards of savers,

particularly senior citizens. Within the flexible

inflation targeting framework, inflation is expected to

be maintained in mid single digit levels on a sustained

basis, implying lower nominal yields on savings

in the period ahead, although positive real returns

will be preserved. Such developments underscore

the need to introduce new financial products such

as annuity and pension products and bundling the

ordinary deposits with other financial products, for

instance, medical insurance, thereby securing a

reasonable rate of return. Further, enhancing public

awareness on the benefits of alternative financial

products such as mutual funds and unit trusts, which

usually yield higher returns compared to interest

bearing instruments such as bank deposits is vital,

while establishing a nationwide contributory pension

scheme, particularly in the context of a rapidly ageing

population in the country. At the same time, the

general public should exercise vigilance and avoid

unauthorised establishments or financial products,

which claim to offer unusually high returns, as such

investments may eventually result in a loss of hard

earned savings.

43

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

Proactive and timely measures to promote the

consolidation of the financial sector are required

in order to enhance the resilience and the ability

of the financial system to facilitate growth of

the economy. The continued subpar growth of the

economy has had a severe effect on the financial

system as the economy and the financial sector

are interdependent. Low levels of credit growth,

tightening profitability of financial intermediaries,

increased propensity of banks to raise the share of

risk free government securities in asset portfolios and

a rise in NPLs could lead to rising stress levels in the

financial sector. NPLs have been on the rise since

2017 with a noticeable deterioration in credit quality,

particularly in the non bank financial institutions

sector during 2019. With due consideration to these

developments, the imposition of more stringent

credit screening conditions by lending institutions

could hinder the flow of credit to riskier segments

of borrowers, such as small and medium scale

enterprises. On the other hand, provision of credit to

such borrowers is vital considering their contribution

to overall production networks and the productive

capacity of the economy. This highlights the need

for a stable, resilient and dynamic financial sector

to facilitate the transition of the economy to a high

and sustainable growth trajectory. For this purpose,

the financial system should possess sufficient

depth, capital buffers, an effective level of credit

expansion and risk mitigation capacity. The current

fragmented nature of the financial sector makes the

system vulnerable to external shocks and prevents

cost effective provision of financial services to

productive sectors. This must be addressed

through the consolidation of the financial sector

by merging relatively small financial institutions

to create a sector comprising strong and dynamic

institutions, which cater to all sectors of the economy

and exhibit resilience to domestic and external

shocks. The international experience of financial

sector consolidation highlights that mergers and

acquisitions could lead to cost savings stemming

from economies of scale, economies of scope,

and improved allocation of resources. Such robust

and dynamic financial institutions will be pivotal

for Sri Lanka to harness the opportunities that are

expected to accrue from emerging as a financial hub

in the region. Among other benefits, the presence of

world class financial institutions can pave the way

for Sri Lanka to access international capital markets

easily, while enabling the generation of other

information flows and networks that can help foster

the creation of talent and investment required for

financial innovation, resulting in positive spillovers to

the broader economy.

As Sri Lanka aspires to become a global

financial hub with the development of the ‘New

Colombo’, enhancing the efficiency and depth

of the financial sector becomes essential. Over

the past decade, a notable expansion in Sri Lanka’s

financial system was observed in terms of asset

size, while the outreach and density of financial

institutions within Sri Lanka increased noticeably,

leading to a gradual increase in financial inclusion.

Also, the increased use of new technologies

in the provision of financial services deserves

commendation. Despite these achievements,

the financial sector of Sri Lanka could experience

challenges in transforming itself into a state-of-the-

art financial service provider within the context of

an international financial hub. The lack of variety in

existing financial products and the slow introduction

of new financial products and services could restrict

the deepening of the domestic financial market.

Further, the capital market of Sri Lanka is yet to

venture beyond the traditional instruments such as

stocks and bonds into instruments like derivatives

and commodities. Moreover, the lack of access to

low cost funds impedes the overall borrowing and

affects the sustainability of financial institutions.

Furthermore, awareness on tech based financial

44

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

1

products is below average in Sri Lanka. Also,

financial institutions in Sri Lanka lack the capacity to

serve the funding needs of large scale infrastructure

projects and public private partnerships. The

way forward for financial institutions would be to

collaborate with fintech companies and provide their

clients with novel instruments such as investment-

and certainty-based financial solutions like education

and pension plans, and derivatives as well as tech-

based products. The general public is likely to rapidly

embrace these new financial solutions once their

benefits, as well as associated risks, are highlighted

through appropriate awareness programmes.

Initiatives by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka such

as the setting up of a FinTech Regulatory Sandbox

and evaluating the possibility of introducing an Open

Banking Framework for Sri Lanka are expected to

support the advancement of the domestic financial

sector. Meanwhile, equity market activity could be

boosted further by promoting equity derivatives and

short selling. Also, the use of blockchain technology

would make capital markets more efficient by

creating encrypted smart contracts that are safe,

secure, fast and cost effective. Necessary support

from financial sector regulators and the government,

along with a strong and stable political and business

environment, could set the stage for Sri Lanka to

transform itself into a highly sought after international

financial hub.

As Sri Lanka is becoming increasingly

connected to the rest of the world via movements

of people and goods, the implementation of a

coherent policy framework for surveillance and

quarantine is essential, as evidenced by the

rapid contagion of the COVID-19 pandemic. With

expanding travel and trade globally, Sri Lanka is

exposed to cross border transmission of diseases,

which could affect people, animals and plants

threatening the health and safety of the ecosystem

of the country. Though Sri Lanka has made notable

improvements in terms of controlling communicable

diseases, increased global mobility of people has

raised the possibility of recurrence of controlled

communicable diseases. Meanwhile, outbreaks

such as COVID-19, SARS, MERS, Ebola, avian flu

and swine flu, highlight the need for strong policy

frameworks to strengthen the health and safety

practices, including surveillance and quarantining.

Further, the use of physical and human resources

for disease surveillance at entry points to the

country needs to be further strengthened in view

of the expected increase in tourist arrivals in future.

Moreover, the spread of trans-boundary plant pests

and diseases has increased significantly in recent

years through the importation of plant material

from other countries. Most destructive migrant

pests, such as the Fall Army worm and fruit flies,

cause substantial losses to crop cultivations,

endangering the livelihoods of economically

vulnerable farmers and the food and nutrition

security of the country. Inadequate quarantine

regulations in granting clearance for vessels and

cargo as well as in warehouses could increase

the incidence of pest and disease outbreaks. In

addition, there is a wide range of diseases, such

as the Bovine Viral Diarrhoea, transmitted through

livestock trade, especially through the importation

of animal stocks for productivity enhancement and

breeding purposes, endangering local breeds.

Such diseases can potentially jeopardise the entire

livestock production of medium and small scale

farmers. Such potential health and safety risks to

the ecosystem of the country reflect the need to

strengthen its quarantine regulation framework in

order to prevent the entry, establishment and spread

of diseases, while safeguarding the overall system

from health problems. Quarantine policies should

be in accordance with the international standards

of regulations to prevent cross border transmissions

of vectors. Exporters of agricultural products should

also follow the global best practices in order to ensure

45

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1

that goods are free from pests and disease causing

organisms, as any presence of such organisms in

exported commodities may result in a rejection of

the consignment by the importing country as well as

any further exports of the product from Sri Lanka, as

observed in recent years.

The importance of strengthening disaster

management plans and social protection

programmes is underscored to tackle the socio-

economic effects arising from hazards, such as

the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and other

emergencies. Shocks such as floods, landslides,

and epidemics have a direct impact on households

while having indirect costs on the broader economy

including fiscal costs and numerous socio-economic

costs. Therefore, the country’s disaster management

plans need to be strengthened to address these

effects, which have a disproportionately high

impact on the poor and vulnerable groups, such

as the elderly, people with disabilities, women

and children. Although the COVID-19 outbreak

and physical distancing measures that had to be

introduced could be an extreme case of a disaster, it

is necessary for disaster management plans to take

into account such extreme scenarios as well. These

emergencies can instigate spikes in poverty levels

within the population as poor and vulnerable groups

tend to experience a longer time for recovery,

while economic activity gets affected by disruptions

to production and consumption. In the current

context, low income, daily wage earners, especially

informal sector workers, have shown the greatest

vulnerability, as income earning opportunities

of such workers have been restricted either due

to the lockdown or disruptions to supply chains.

Further, farming and fishing communities as well

as micro, small and medium scale enterprises have

been affected significantly due to limited access

to markets, disruption to transport and logistics

systems, and labour shortages. Low income

households generally do not have alternative

livelihood opportunities or savings, and may have

limited access to social protection. In the face of

such situations, some flexibility in expanding social

protection becomes an integral part of the disaster

management programme in order to cushion direct

and indirect economic shocks and combat spiralling

poverty levels. For this purpose, the government

needs to build up the necessary fiscal space for

such contingencies.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent

global response highlight the presence of

several fault lines that have necessitated

policy responses which are substantially

different from those observed in crisis episodes

experienced in the past. The acceleration of the

COVID-19 spread from an isolated outbreak in

China to a global pandemic within three months

has resulted in an outpour of unprecedented policy

responses. The rapid spread of the virus has been

attributed to reduced border controls and thereby

the ease of international travel which are key

underpinnings of globalisation. The cornerstones

of international policy response have been the

imposition of barriers to both movement of people

and trade, resulting in an increased reliance on the

‘nation state’. In turn, this has led to the advocacy

of localisation of production and protectionism as

economic safeguards in many countries, including

Sri Lanka. Rapid innovation, adoption of new

technologies and reverse engineering have been

employed to produce essential goods, especially

personal protective equipment, and ventilators.

Other initiatives such as the ‘Saubhagya National

Programme on Harvesting and Cultivation’ that aims

to develop 1 million home gardens to achieve self-

sufficiency can provide immense benefits over time.

Novel service provisioning has been undertaken not

only in public health care but also in other essential

services such as banking and even retail shopping.

46

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

Hence, such crises allow both policymakers and the

general public to consider and adopt innovative and

efficient strategies that during normalcy may seem

unviable or unpopular. However, countries are also

adopting ‘reverse protectionism’ measures – the

restriction of exports rather than imports. Such new

protectionism could prolong the pandemic as not all

economies possess the resources to tackle evolving

challenges. It is vital to acknowledge that preventive

measures and cures are ‘global public goods’ and

that the widespread availability of these can help

curb this crisis as all populations can only benefit

from the same without inflicting harm on others.

However, shortages in key medical supplies have

led countries to ban the export of masks and other

protective equipment. While this can cater to the

individual needs of the country in the short run, it

can also lead to a spiral of retaliation and fear that

hurts citizens and businesses as other governments

protect themselves or retaliate by also banning

exports. Also, in the context of limited resources,

productivity and competitive advantage, such forceful

prioritisation of home markets can create a situation

where countries are worse off as each government

will find it more challenging to fight the contagion on

their own. In the short term, such policy responses

can hinder the much needed global cooperation

against the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby leading to

several human casualties and potential prolonging

of economic disruption. Over the longer term, this

can lead to a substantial deterioration of global

supply chain networks. While the current breakdown

may provide opportunities for economies to focus on

domestic production, reentry into sectors which the

economy has progressed out of may not create as

many benefits. For instance, reentry into low value

adding manufacturing industries may not create

as many jobs now due to the automation process

such industries have undergone in recent years.

Such automation is essential to have a competitive

advantage. Despite these fault lines, all countries

are likely to reembrace globalisation, although in

a modified form, as underlying drivers will remain

unchanged. These include the need to trade goods

and services, and the need to access cheap labour

and external capital. In order to foster a strong,

sustained and inclusive recovery, global cooperation

is necessary. A unanimous and coordinated global

response will pave way for a much faster recovery

of the ‘global village’ than sporadic and solitary

measures, which seek to solely benefit individual

countries at the expense of vulnerable economies.

The events such as the outbreak of the COVID-19

pandemic could significantly influence the modus

operandi of the way the economies, including Sri

Lanka, conduct business domestically as well as

globally. Sri Lanka’s preparedness to face such

events and take appropriate measures to prevent any

adverse impact on the economy remains critical in

ensuring sustainable development over the medium

term. Country’s adoptability to changing dynamics

would enable its takeoff towards greater heights in

the next upturn in the global business cycle.

The preceding discussion attempted to

highlight the numerous issues and challenges

faced by the Sri Lankan economy that should be

addressed if sustained and equitable growth and

development are to be achieved as envisaged.

These concerns, as well as many others, have

been raised in previous Annual Reports of the

Central Bank, and are also highlighted at various

policy discussions, alongside possible remedies

to overcome such issues. Regrettably, this list of

issues and challenges continues to lengthen over

time. It is hoped that the government makes use of

the expected political stability following the General

Election to pursue a proactive reform agenda with an

emphasis on the implementation of national policies

to address such issues and challenges, developed in

consultation with all relevant stakeholders, enabling

the Sri Lankan economy to takeoff on a sustainable

footing, which would allow all Sri Lankans to enjoy

prosperity that has eluded them in the past.

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

Background

Sri Lanka was predominantly an agrarian economy with a somewhat higher per capita income compared to other developing countries, when it became a self governing nation in 1948. Subsequent governments that came to power adopted numerous policies aiming to stimulate growth and enhance welfare. Apart from policy swings, the internal conflict and youth uprisings caused severe damage to the economy, including loss of human capital and resources, while curtailing the fiscal space on investing in development projects, and preventing the economy from reaping expected benefits of various types of policy reforms introduced from time to time. With the end of the internal conflict in 2009, the economy started to unleash its potential along with large infrastructure development, recording above 8 per cent growth on average in the three years that followed, accompanied by rebounding investor confidence. Sri Lanka was progressing well towards graduating into an upper middle income country, but the progress slowed amidst subdued economic growth over the subsequent years (Figure B 3.1) due to various reasons.

BOX 3Sri Lanka’s Economic Takeoff – The Need and The Readiness

While Sri Lanka is now classified as an upper middle income country, it is essential that the country adopts sound economic policies in order to avoid the “Middle Income Trap” and takeoff to become a high income nation with equitable and sustained growth.

Sri Lanka’s Strengths

Sri Lanka stands way ahead of its regional peers in the human development track record, positioning itself among the high human development group, ranking 71 out of 189 countries. In terms of the literacy rates, Sri Lanka surpasses the regional and global averages with a rate of 92.5 per cent.1 Further, Sri Lanka’s social indicators rank among the highest in South Asia, with over 90 per cent households all over the island having access to safe drinking water and with even better records in the health sector backed by free universal healthcare facilities.2 Extreme poverty is not common, and poverty, as measured by the Poverty Headcount Ratio (PHCR),

decreased significantly to reach 4.1 per cent by 2016 from 26.1 per cent recorded in 1996.3 Further, the physical infrastructure development recorded significant growth in recent years with progress in various fronts, including becoming an almost fully electrified nation, remarkable levels of telecommunication connectivity, continuous additions to the country’s expressway network connecting the commercial capital to regional capitals, and the completion of reclamation in relation to Colombo International Financial City. These developments are also reflected in increased ranking in the infrastructure sector of the 2019 Global Competitiveness Index by 4 positions to 61, endorsing Sri Lanka to become the most improved economy in the South Asian region in the overall index.4 Exemplary diplomatic relationships garnered from the friendly, non aligned foreign policy followed by the nation since independence could be harnessed to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as well as to foster the country’s international trade performance. Further, recent measures taken by the government to improve female participation in the active labour force could support inclusive economic growth.

An island privileged by its strategically important location, Sri Lanka is in the midst of the ancient maritime Silk Route and has been in the spotlight of Eastern and Western merchants throughout history. With growing trade between Asia and the rest of the World, Sri Lanka’s geographic location has become even more important today, indicating its potential to evolve as an international maritime and logistics hub. Besides, vibrant aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems influenced by distinct geographic and climatic factors since prehistoric periods as well as inherited cultural values have blessed the nation with a large potential for ecotourism and wellness tourism. Moreover, proper and sustainable sourcing of substantial natural resources, including the mineral resources in the Eastern coast, would aid in boosting the development of the economy.

The Sri Lankan economy has been enjoying single digit inflation consecutively for over a decade as a result of proactive, forward looking monetary policy. Maintaining inflation at low and stable levels is considered to be an essential component to generate overall macroeconomic stability and support growth endeavours by facilitating the country’s competitiveness, while helping to protect vulnerable segments of the population and boost employment creating production growth. This significant change in the structure of the Sri Lankan economy,

which was once considered an economy with double digit inflation, will remain a catalyst in its efforts towards takeoff in the period ahead.

Issues and Challenges

Sri Lanka has not been able to maintain high growth over extended periods of time due to numerous reasons including high budget deficits, high trade and current account deficits, issues in land, labour and capital markets, traditional and bureaucratic institutions, cultural factors, weak governance structures, political instability and corruption, in addition to the factors mentioned at the outset.

It is worth noting that exports and FDI have been key drivers of growth in many successful economies in Asia. However, Sri Lanka’s progress in terms of exports and FDI has been subpar compared to its regional counterparts. Sri Lanka has not been able to diversify exports and its share in global trade has declined over time, unlike its East Asian neighbours, and its exports structure has not evolved to the next level beyond apparel, tea and rubber products since the early 1990s. Anti export bias, lack of private domestic and foreign investment in the tradable, particularly industry sector, lack of innovation and research and development (R&D) have further deepened the woes of the exports sector. Meanwhile, the volatile economic and political climate together with the bureaucratic and restrictive investment climate have deterred foreign investment inflows to Sri Lanka. These developments have led to the widening of the external current account deficit forcing the country to increasingly rely on foreign borrowings to finance such deficits.

To achieve sustainable and inclusive growth, the workforce needs to be prepared for the challenges of the 21st century. Although Sri Lanka’s performance in terms of human development has been commendable, high levels of educated youth unemployment and low levels of female labour participation have been observed compared to other emerging markets. Female labour force participation in Sri Lanka and in the region, has remained significantly lower than economies like China and those in the ASEAN region, and this is a serious concern for Sri Lanka given its large pool of highly educated females who are neither employed nor looking for work. In addition, inadequate exposure to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education at secondary, higher education and university levels, has created a low skilled workforce that is unfit to serve the needs of present day employers and to create entrepreneurs.

Furthermore, Sri Lanka is undergoing a rapid ageing of its population, and has reached an advanced stage of this demographic transition compared to its peers.

According to projections of the UN, between 2015 to 2060, the dependency ratio of the elderly is projected to rise sharply while that of the young would fall. In addition, Sri Lanka’s population is projected to peak in the mid 2040s (Figure B 3.2). The share of the elderly is projected to increase to 25.7 per cent of the total population by 2050 compared to 13.4 per cent in 2015. This implies a contraction of the labour force, lower productivity, greater fiscal burden in the form of healthcare and elderly care, and high retirement benefit costs in the future. In fact, according to the World Social Protection Report (2017-2019), less than one third of the Sri Lankan population is covered by at least one social protection benefit scheme and only around 25 per cent of old age citizens are receiving a pension.

A key source of economic instability in Sri Lanka for many years has risen from misaligned fiscal operations. Compared to emerging market peers, Sri Lanka’s fiscal deficits have remained high over time amidst declining government revenues and rising recurrent expenditure. Strikingly, the tax revenue to GDP ratio in Sri Lanka is

one of the lowest by international standards. Moreover, government expenditure has continued to increase over the years in spite of the steps taken to rationalise expenditure. Reflecting the impact of sustained large budget deficits, debt levels in Sri Lanka have also remained high. Rising levels of external commercial debt have created a further drag on government finances, thus elevating risk and associated premiums, causing an increase in interest costs. Sri Lanka has little fiscal space to drive growth through large and continued fiscal stimulus and to pursue large infrastructure development projects, highlighting the need for intense fiscal reforms if the country is traverse a high growth trajectory.

Political instability and policy uncertainty create significant challenges for sustained economic growth since the associated uncertainties, negatively impact investment decisions and business confidence. Aisen and Veiga (2011) argue that political instability may shorten policy authorities’ horizons, leading to sub optimal short term economic policies, and may also cause “a more frequent switch of policies, creating volatility and thus, negatively affecting macroeconomic performance”. Political stability, presence of good governance, effectiveness of the government, rule of law, and eradication of corruption contribute positively to the sustained growth of an economy. Although Sri Lanka has remained a vibrant democracy resulting in frequent changes in governments, the absence of an independent civil service and the lack of national policies have led to inconsistent policies and affected Sri Lanka’s image as a predictable destination for investment and other long term economic activities.

Strategies to Support Sri Lanka’s Economic Takeoff

As discussed above, while several crucial conditions are already in place, there remain numerous hindrances that need to be addressed through policy reforms to support Sri Lanka’s economic takeoff. Some examples of such reforms that could help Sri Lanka take the next leap forward towards becoming a high income economy over the next decade are outlined below.

A breakthrough in Sri Lanka’s export strategy would serve as a springboard for the country to become a high income economy. Sri Lanka’s merchandise export strategy needs to be revolutionised by diversifying to the export of medium to high technology products such as machinery and equipment, electronics, vehicles and pharmaceuticals, and value added mineral products, from the traditional low technology products such as garments and tea. Vietnam, a well known achiever in Asia, diversified its exports from agriculture and natural

resources based products to apparel in the early 1990s and then to electronics in the late 2000s, and thus stands among the leading exporters in the global production network today.

Sri Lanka should also look beyond its traditional export markets. Exports to the West have accounted for over half of its total exports, supported by preferential access to some extent. While GSP and GSP+ programmes have supported Sri Lanka in boosting its exports in the past, such benefits are shortlived, and will not be available for an upper middle income economy. Therefore, Sri Lanka should gradually shift its focus towards exporting to emerging Asia and other non traditional markets.

In addition to the diversification of merchandise exports, Sri Lanka needs to focus on further improving services exports. In addition to the already earmarked services sectors such as tourism and IT-BPO, measures should also be taken to improve exports of other important services such as logistics and financial services. The Colombo Commercial and Financial Hub, once ready for operation, would enable Sri Lanka to earn additional foreign exchange through the export of these services.

Sri Lanka needs to form strategic economic partnerships with other nations, particularly the regional countries, to promote its exports and maximise benefits from the movement of capital and human resources. Sri Lanka could, yet again, learn from the experience of Vietnam, which rose to become a leading emerging Asian economy driven by export growth. Since 1995, Vietnam actively signed multiple free trade agreements (FTAs), which resulted in the lowering of tariffs on Vietnamese exports, thereby paving way for the expansion of its exports sector as well as its economy. While taking measures to reap the most from the existing FTAs, measures should be taken to establish new trade pacts with other trading giants while preserving the country’s sovereignty and independence. Such trade agreements would assist domestic exporters to integrate into global value chains (GVCs), thereby improving access to markets, while also promoting competition, improving efficiency and supporting innovation.

More crucially, Sri Lanka should also increasingly focus on attracting non debt creating financial flows to support reaching a higher growth trajectory through increased domestic production. Although inflows of FDI to Sri Lanka have gradually risen over the past decade, it remains well below the levels experienced by its regional peers. For instance, Vietnam, with the implementation of investor friendly policies and reforms over the years, has been successful in attracting substantially high FDI to productive and tradable

sectors, and is now home to some of the world’s leading electronic brands such as Intel, Samsung, Mitsubishi, GE, LG and Panasonic. Learning from this experience, Sri Lanka should also focus on attracting FDI towards infrastructure development as well as production that could promote the exchange of technology and expertise. Timely introduction of necessary legal, institutional and labour market reforms to address FDI deterrents would improve ranking of ease of doing business and enhance investor confidence in Sri Lanka. With increased FDI, producers would have enhanced access to GVCs, availing them of the opportunity to produce new products, and expand and diversify into new markets, while also leading to job creation, thus supporting the country’s overall growth and development agenda. While supporting the stability of the exchange rate, higher FDI would also generate increased foreign revenue in the form of export earnings, thereby reducing the need for debt creating foreign funds to finance external current account deficits and improving government revenues in the long term.

As highlighted by authors such as Agénor, Canuto, and Jelenic (2012) and Agénor (2017), the lack of high quality human capital to meet the 21st century’s labour market challenges is one of the reasons for the stagnation of countries at middle income levels, since it limits the benefits achievable with borrowed technologies from other countries and also the development of suitable technologies inhouse. Investment in high skilled education and labour market reforms are necessary to face this obstacle. When considering the composition of graduates of Sri Lanka, a majority seems to specialise in humanities and aesthetic studies. However, countries such as Singapore and South Korea, which have transitioned into the

high income category from middle income levels, produce a higher proportion of graduates in science and technology related fields, thereby increasing their innovative capabilities. It is equally important to develop and support industries that require high skilled labour, so that the demand for such graduates would also be high. Therefore, in the context of Sri Lanka, the country needs to focus not only on the supply of experts by supporting science and technology related fields of higher education, but also needs to increase the demand for such experts. Experiences of the recent past highlight that many graduates migrate following the completion of their studies, leaving behind a heavy fiscal burden given the free education system in the country. Also, many graduates seem to favour government jobs over private sector employment preferring higher job security, despite the higher wage levels in the private sector, especially in sectors requiring higher skills. This phenomenon suggests an already existing shortage of such experts in the private sector, as highlighted by Nedelkoska, O’Brien and Stock (2018). Therefore, within the government’s initiatives to broaden the university intake, further efforts are imperative to widen access to tertiary education to match the demands of the labour market. At the same time, studies including Delalibera and Ferreira (2019) have found evidence suggesting that the quality of early childhood education can contribute to increased levels of labour productivity, and Sri Lanka also needs to improve the quality of the primary and secondary layers of the education system. Improvements to the quality of the labour force achievable through such measures could also be beneficial in facing the country’s emerging demographic challenges.

A common argument in literature on the middle income trap is that it occurs due to the inability to innovate. In many developing Asian countries, the importance given to intellectual property rights is low when compared to its Western counterparts. In the case of Sri Lanka, the existing laws and regulations are quite extensive in protecting intellectual property rights established by foreign entities, but attempts to establish intellectual property rights for local innovators and inventions are slow and involve tedious processes, thus discouraging innovation as it is difficult for inventors to obtain economic gains from their efforts. Thus, from a policy perspective, it is important to take measures to improve awareness of intellectual property rights and to ensure enforcement of such rules and regulations, while actively supporting local innovators to establish such rights domestically and abroad.

South East Asian success stories such as Singapore and South Korea suggest that improving access to advanced infrastructure, including telecommunication and broadband has contributed to sustained growth. Despite having made commendable progress in this regard, there is still ample space for improvement in Sri Lanka, as suggested by indicators such as a relatively high effective cost of broadband and a relatively low internet penetration rate (although the mobile phone penetration rate is at comparable levels) when compared with regional peers. With respect to transport infrastructure as well, the country could gain higher economic and social benefits by complementing the improvements to the road network by upgrading public transportation and the railway network.

Enhanced entrepreneurship paves way to generate higher levels of output and productivity of a country, increasing national income and income distribution

through improved employment together with higher earnings. A well developed entrepreneurial culture of a country underpinned by a conducive environment to conduct business, enables the economy to move ahead in terms of attracting investments, thereby boosting overall economic activity. As per Doing Business 2020,5 Sri Lanka holds the 99th position out of 190 economies for ease of doing business, remaining below its regional peers. India managed to raise its ranking through streamlining its reform strategies giving priority to the Doing Business indicators. Countries like Vietnam have upgraded their information technology infrastructure to make it easy to pay taxes. Recently, Sri Lanka too, made a few efforts to upgrade the information technology infrastructure by introducing online systems for filing taxes, processing constructions permits and business registration. With a view to facilitating and attracting foreign investments, the Board of Investment (BOI) has introduced an online application tracking system. The relatively poor score of Sri Lanka on the ease of doing business indicates that there is ample room for further improvement. In Sri Lanka, a lack of improvements can be observed in the areas of getting credit, enforcing contracts, especially in terms of the time and cost spent on resolving a commercial dispute and the quality of the judicial process as well as resolving insolvency considering the recovery rate and reinforcement of the legal framework for insolvency. Further developments can be achieved through government involvement in evolving the country’s entrepreneurship by implementing broad minded, long term policies and programmes that offer opportunities for entrepreneurs.

For decades, Sri Lanka, as a twin deficit country, has been relying on domestic and foreign borrowings for financing deficits. With a view to strengthening the fiscal position and maintaining government debt at a sustainable level, successive governments have pursued fiscal consolidation strategies, augmenting revenue by expanding the tax base, improving tax administration and compliance, while also rationalising expenditures. Recent tax reform initiatives including those aimed at improving tax administration, are expected to make the country’s tax system simpler, while improving business confidence. As government expenditure also remains high, it is crucial for the government to increasingly focus on rationalising expenditure alongside fiscal consolidation measures with a proper monitoring process of government expenditure, without compromising essential public investment. These measures are important in the effort of moving toward becoming a high income country, as unsustainable levels of budget deficits and debt lead to macroeconomic instability, thereby hindering growth. In addition, the government needs to strengthen its efforts on reforming and restructuring State Owned Business Enterprises, thereby enhancing their financial viability and helping to reduce central government expenditure, while inculcating greater discipline in fiscal affairs.

It is widely accepted that political stability is a prerequisite for economic stability. However, consensus across political regimes on long term economic goals is even more important for sustainable growth. Experiences from Finland and Singapore, discussed by Foxley and Sossdorf (2011) and Chua (2011), respectively, suggest that social and political consensus on long term economic priorities can lead to many years of sustained growth. This has historically been a weak area in Sri Lanka as economic priorities have varied frequently when political regimes change. Thus, going forward, it is essential that the people of Sri Lanka demand for a

consensus on long term economic goals of the country and persuade political authorities to collectively commit to implement consistent policies to achieve these goals, if the country is to progress towards high income levels with equitable and sustained growth.

Conclusion

Sri Lanka, once considered a promising emerging and developing economy and famously referred to as the “Wonder of Asia” with the dawn of peace in 2009, has to tread through rough waters over the past several years resulting in poor macroeconomic performance, particularly in terms of subpar growth and rising external and fiscal sector vulnerabilities. The absence of national economic policies, delayed implementation of the required structural reforms and the inability to build sufficient policy spaces have led the country to lose its steam as a fast growing economy in the region, amidst domestic political uncertainties, the Easter Sunday attacks, and frequent natural disasters. Moreover, uncertainties in the global front have also posed significant challenges to domestic economic activity. In spite of these drawbacks, Sri Lanka has managed to make steady progress in terms of reducing poverty, upgrading human capital, promoting good governance, fostering healthy international diplomatic and economic relations with key development partners, and maintaining single digit inflation for over a decade, to name a few. It is expected that these factors, together with the country’s natural strengths and the implementation of appropriate policy reforms, particularly to address the deficiencies highlighted above, would set the stage for Sri Lanka to takeoff and reemerge as the economic miracle of Asia.
