    "text": "Sri Lanka graduated to the upper middle income country status as per the World Bank classification of countries published in July 2019. The World Bank classifies countries based on per capita Gross National Income (GNI) into income categories of low income, lower middle income, upper middle income and high income1 (Figure B 1.1). As per this classification, Sri Lanka transitioned from the low income country status to the lower middle income country status in 1997. Since then, the country has progressed through challenging periods, including the catastrophic Tsunami disaster in 2004, the escalation of the civil conflict until its end in 2009, periods of extreme weather conditions and related natural disasters, and socio-economic and political changes. Despite the adverse impacts of such disturbances on the macroeconomy, the country recorded above five per cent GDP growth on average since the graduation to a lower middle income country, and reached the upper middle income level. However, Sri Lanka took 21 years to graduate from the lower middle income category to the next level, thereby spending a relatively long period compared to some other emerging market economies. In this context, it is essential that Sri Lanka introduces the necessary structural reforms in a timely manner in order to ensure that a strong growth momentum is sustained in the period ahead, and thereby to avoid possible stagnation in the middle income levels for a longer period, i.e., the middle income trap.2 Table B 1.1 exhibits the time taken by selected countries to move from the upper middle income level to high income level, which ranges between 7 \u2013 40 years.3 Although there is a lack of consensus as to why countries get trapped in middle income levels, literature points to the slowdown in productivity as the major contributory factor caused by lack of economic diversification, rigid and inefficient labour markets, lack of access to advanced infrastructure, weak institutions, low levels of innovation, etc. For instance, Pruchnik and Zowczak (2017) highlighted seven factors, which are often associated with growth slowdowns, namely, unfavourable demographics, low level of economic diversification, inefficient financial markets, insufficient advanced infrastructure, low levels of innovation, weak institutions and inefficient labour markets.

Economists use this term to represent a scenario where countries that move with speed into middle income levels failing to continue such growth momentum so as to reach high income levels. The definition of middle income trap is not consistent among different studies conducted in this literature, making the number of countries recognised as caught in a middle income trap to differ across different authors. For instance, Pruchnik and Zowczak (2017) compare such different contributions in the middle income trap literature, suggesting that Sri Lanka is caught in the middle income trap as per two studies, thus highlighting the need for measures to avoid such stagnation.",

With 2.5 million people infected and more than 150,000 deaths by mid April, the economic repercussions of the ongoing \u2018Great Lockdown\u2019 are expected to dwarf the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-08. Policymakers around the world are struggling to grapple with this crisis episode amidst numerous uncertainties. While Sri Lanka has been relatively successful in combating the outbreak thus far, as a result of early measures adopted to contain the spread, the interplay of setbacks to domestic economic activity stemming from such containment measures and spillover effects from the global economy are likely to have a notable impact on the Sri Lankan economy during the year.",

Despite introducing awareness measures that had prevented any outbreak till early March, the continued arrival of tourists, the return of Sri Lankans from countries that were most affected by the virus, and the lack of adherence to the containment measures that were imposed from mid March 2020 fuelled the outbreak. Nevertheless, efforts to restrict the mobility of people by enforcing police curfew in the country, the closure of airports from 19 March 2020, and actions to quarantine returnees from abroad helped to largely contain the spread \u2013 the identified pockets are mainly clustered in a few areas in the Western Province and the Districts of Puttalam and Jaffna. The government established two high level units to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, while easing the difficulties faced by the public amidst restrictions imposed on mobility. Accordingly, the National Operation Centre for Prevention of the COVID-19 Outbreak coordinates the preventive and management measures of the outbreak, while ensuring the provision of healthcare and other services to the general public.

The declaration of holidays, curfew, restricted public services and other measures to contain human movement including the shutdown of airports and seaports for passenger traffic will affect several key economic sectors. The socio-economic impact could also be extensive with the loss of income and livelihoods for a large segment of society. With approximately 60 per cent of those employed being engaged in the informal sector and an estimated 1.9 million being daily wage earners, a large number of households is likely to be in a precarious position. Other vulnerable segments of the population, such as the elderly and the large number of people living just above the poverty threshold, will be disproportionately affected by this episode.

However, such positive effects have thus far been negated by the capital flow reversals that are being seen across emerging market economies, including Sri Lanka. Although Sri Lanka\u2019s exposure to short term capital flows is marginal, this has resulted in the sharp escalation of Sri Lanka\u2019s international sovereign bond yields, similar to the experience of other emerging market and developing economies.

These recent measures include various concessions for businesses engaged in the tourism, apparel, and wholesale and retail trade sectors, the introduction of maximum retail prices for selected essential food items and certain medical items, and a cash grant of Rs. 5,000 as a lump sum payment for low income and vulnerable families and individuals. Further, the Agrahara insurance benefits were doubled for all health, police and civil defence employees, and all government servants engaged in controlling the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. Meanwhile, the government initiated several measures on an urgent basis to ensure the availability of required funds for virus combating efforts, while also ensuring liquidity for businesses affected by long overdue payments. Such measures included allocations for settling payment arrears of small and medium scale contractors and to private institutions on account of purchasing of pharmaceuticals, and for settling procurement bills for fertiliser purchases. Further, the government allocated an additional Rs. 500 million",

A COVID-19 Healthcare and Social Security Fund was set up to help the provision of the necessary healthcare and relief measures, and a special bank account was opened by the President\u2019s Fund, in which Rs. 100 million was initially deposited to be utilised for tasks related to preventing the spread of the pandemic. The government also established a fuel price stabilisation fund, aimed at raising a sum of about Rs. 200 billion within a period of 6 months, benefiting from the significantly low petroleum prices in the international markets. With due consideration to the burden of Value Added Tax (VAT) on firms, a grace period was granted until April 30 for payment of VAT accruing to February and March 2020. In spite of the limited fiscal space available to the government, the spaces built up in the monetary policy sphere, in terms of maintaining low inflation, and in the financial sector sphere, in terms of maintaining capital and liquidity buffers above industry norms, enabled the Central Bank to support the efforts of the government to implement the relief measures outlined above, while providing direct financing to the government, considering national interest.",

Although the recovery of global economic activity is likely to be a slow process, measures to achieve normalcy in domestic economic activities could enable Sri Lanka to record a faster recovery, as domestic demand accounts for a significant portion of aggregate demand in Sri Lanka.",

Subsequent governments that came to power adopted numerous policies aiming to stimulate growth and enhance welfare. Apart from policy swings, the internal conflict and youth uprisings caused severe damage to the economy, including loss of human capital and resources, while curtailing the fiscal space on investing in development projects, and preventing the economy from reaping expected benefits of various types of policy reforms introduced from time to time. With the end of the internal conflict in 2009, the economy started to unleash its potential along with large infrastructure development, recording above 8 per cent growth on average in the three years that followed, accompanied by rebounding investor confidence. Sri Lanka was progressing well towards graduating into an upper middle income country, but the progress slowed amidst subdued economic growth over the subsequent years (Figure B 3.1) due to various reasons.",

These developments are also reflected in increased ranking in the infrastructure sector of the 2019 Global Competitiveness Index by 4 positions to 61, endorsing Sri Lanka to become the most improved economy in the South Asian region in the overall index.4 Exemplary diplomatic relationships garnered from the friendly, non aligned foreign policy followed by the nation since independence could be harnessed to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) as well as to foster the country\u2019s international trade performance. Further, recent measures taken by the government to improve female participation in the active labour force could support inclusive economic growth.",

However, Sri Lanka\u2019s progress in terms of exports and FDI has been subpar compared to its regional counterparts. Sri Lanka has not been able to diversify exports and its share in global trade has declined over time, unlike its East Asian neighbours, and its exports structure has not evolved to the next level beyond apparel, tea and rubber products since the early 1990s. Anti export bias, lack of private domestic and foreign investment in the tradable, particularly industry sector, lack of innovation and research and development (R&D) have further deepened the woes of the exports sector. Meanwhile, the volatile economic and political climate together with the bureaucratic and restrictive investment climate have deterred foreign investment inflows to Sri Lanka. These developments have led to the widening of the external current account deficit forcing the country to increasingly rely on foreign borrowings to finance such deficits.",

Although Sri Lanka\u2019s performance in terms of human development has been commendable, high levels of educated youth unemployment and low levels of female labour participation have been observed compared to other emerging markets. Female labour force participation in Sri Lanka and in the region, has remained significantly lower than economies like China and those in the ASEAN region, and this is a serious concern for Sri Lanka given its large pool of highly educated females who are neither employed nor looking for work. In addition, inadequate exposure to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education at secondary, higher education and university levels, has created a low skilled workforce that is unfit to serve the needs of present day employers and to create entrepreneurs.",

The share of the elderly is projected to increase to 25.7 per cent of the total population by 2050 compared to 13.4 per cent in 2015. This implies a contraction of the labour force, lower productivity, greater fiscal burden in the form of healthcare and elderly care, and high retirement benefit costs in the future. In fact, according to the World Social Protection Report (2017-2019), less than one third of the Sri Lankan population is covered by at least one social protection benefit scheme and only around 25 per cent of old age citizens are receiving a pension.",

Sri Lanka has little fiscal space to drive growth through large and continued fiscal stimulus and to pursue large infrastructure development projects, highlighting the need for intense fiscal reforms if the country is traverse a high growth trajectory.",

Political stability, presence of good governance, effectiveness of the government, rule of law, and eradication of corruption contribute positively to the sustained growth of an economy. Although Sri Lanka has remained a vibrant democracy resulting in frequent changes in governments, the absence of an independent civil service and the lack of national policies have led to inconsistent policies and affected Sri Lanka\u2019s image as a predictable destination for investment and other long term economic activities.",

Sri Lanka could, yet again, learn from the experience of Vietnam, which rose to become a leading emerging Asian economy driven by export growth. Since 1995, Vietnam actively signed multiple free trade agreements (FTAs), which resulted in the lowering of tariffs on Vietnamese exports, thereby paving way for the expansion of its exports sector as well as its economy. While taking measures to reap the most from the existing FTAs, measures should be taken to establish new trade pacts with other trading giants while preserving the country\u2019s sovereignty and independence. Such trade agreements would assist domestic exporters to integrate into global value chains (GVCs), thereby improving access to markets, while also promoting competition, improving efficiency and supporting innovation.",

It is equally important to develop and support industries that require high skilled labour, so that the demand for such graduates would also be high. Therefore, in the context of Sri Lanka, the country needs to focus not only on the supply of experts by supporting science and technology related fields of higher education, but also needs to increase the demand for such experts. Experiences of the recent past highlight that many graduates migrate following the completion of their studies, leaving behind a heavy fiscal burden given the free education system in the country. Also, many graduates seem to favour government jobs over private sector employment preferring higher job security, despite the higher wage levels in the private sector, especially in sectors requiring higher skills. This phenomenon suggests an already existing shortage of such experts in the private sector, as highlighted by Nedelkoska, O\u2019Brien and Stock (2018). Therefore, within the government\u2019s initiatives to broaden the university intake, further efforts are imperative to widen access to tertiary education to match the demands of the labour market. At the same time, studies including Delalibera and Ferreira (2019) have found evidence suggesting that the quality of early childhood education can contribute to increased levels of labour productivity, and Sri Lanka also needs to improve the quality of the primary and secondary layers of the education system. Improvements to the quality of the labour force achievable through such measures could also be beneficial in facing the country\u2019s emerging demographic challenges.",

    "text": "A common argument in literature on the middle income trap is that it occurs due to the inability to innovate. In many developing Asian countries, the importance given to intellectual property rights is low when compared to its Western counterparts. In the case of Sri Lanka, the existing laws and regulations are quite extensive in protecting intellectual property rights established by foreign entities, but attempts to establish intellectual property rights for local innovators and inventions are slow and involve tedious processes, thus discouraging innovation as it is difficult for inventors to obtain economic gains from their efforts. Thus, from a policy perspective, it is important to take measures to improve awareness of intellectual property rights and to ensure enforcement of such rules and regulations, while actively supporting local innovators to establish such rights domestically and abroad.",

Despite having made commendable progress in this regard, there is still ample space for improvement in Sri Lanka, as suggested by indicators such as a relatively high effective cost of broadband and a relatively low internet penetration rate (although the mobile phone penetration rate is at comparable levels) when compared with regional peers. With respect to transport infrastructure as well, the country could gain higher economic and social benefits by complementing the improvements to the road network by upgrading public transportation and the railway network.",

    "text": "through improved employment together with higher earnings. A well developed entrepreneurial culture of a country underpinned by a conducive environment to conduct business, enables the economy to move ahead in terms of attracting investments, thereby boosting overall economic activity. As per Doing Business 2020,5 Sri Lanka holds the 99th position out of 190 economies for ease of doing business, remaining below its regional peers. India managed to raise its ranking through streamlining its reform strategies giving priority to the Doing Business indicators. Countries like Vietnam have upgraded their information technology infrastructure to make it easy to pay taxes. Recently, Sri Lanka too, made a few efforts to upgrade the information technology infrastructure by introducing online systems for filing taxes, processing constructions permits and business registration. With a view to facilitating and attracting foreign investments, the Board of Investment (BOI) has introduced an online application tracking system. The relatively poor score of Sri Lanka on the ease of doing business indicates that there is ample room for further improvement. In Sri Lanka, a lack of improvements can be observed in the areas of getting credit, enforcing contracts, especially in terms of the time and cost spent on resolving a commercial dispute and the quality of the judicial process as well as resolving insolvency considering the recovery rate and reinforcement of the legal framework for insolvency. Further developments can be achieved through government involvement in evolving the country\u2019s entrepreneurship by implementing broad minded, long term policies and programmes that offer opportunities for entrepreneurs.",

    "text": "For decades, Sri Lanka, as a twin deficit country, has been relying on domestic and foreign borrowings for financing deficits. With a view to strengthening the fiscal position and maintaining government debt at a sustainable level, successive governments have pursued fiscal consolidation strategies, augmenting revenue by expanding the tax base, improving tax administration and compliance, while also rationalising expenditures. Recent tax reform initiatives including those aimed at improving tax administration, are expected to make the country\u2019s tax system simpler, while improving business confidence. As government expenditure also remains high, it is crucial for the government to increasingly focus on rationalising expenditure alongside fiscal consolidation measures with a proper monitoring process of government expenditure, without compromising essential public investment. These measures are important in the effort of moving toward becoming a high income country, as unsustainable levels of budget deficits and debt lead to macroeconomic instability, thereby hindering growth. In addition, the government needs to strengthen its efforts on reforming and restructuring State Owned Business Enterprises, thereby enhancing their financial viability and helping to reduce central government expenditure, while inculcating greater discipline in fiscal affairs.",

    "text": "Sri Lanka, once considered a promising emerging and developing economy and famously referred to as the \u201cWonder of Asia\u201d with the dawn of peace in 2009, has to tread through rough waters over the past several years resulting in poor macroeconomic performance, particularly in terms of subpar growth and rising external and fiscal sector vulnerabilities. The absence of national economic policies, delayed implementation of the required structural reforms and the inability to build sufficient policy spaces have led the country to lose its steam as a fast growing economy in the region, amidst domestic political uncertainties, the Easter Sunday attacks, and frequent natural disasters. Moreover, uncertainties in the global front have also posed significant challenges to domestic economic activity. In spite of these drawbacks, Sri Lanka has managed to make steady progress in terms of reducing poverty, upgrading human capital, promoting good governance, fostering healthy international diplomatic and economic relations with key development partners, and maintaining single digit inflation for over a decade, to name a few. It is expected that these factors, together with the country\u2019s natural strengths and the implementation of appropriate policy reforms, particularly to address the deficiencies highlighted above, would set the stage for Sri Lanka to takeoff and reemerge as the economic miracle of Asia.",
