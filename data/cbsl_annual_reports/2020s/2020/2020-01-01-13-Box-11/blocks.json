    "text": "Regulators of the financial sector around the world began to shift towards increasingly complex and stringent regulatory frameworks in the aftermath of the global financial crisis that occurred in 2007/08. In light of this, the Basel III regulatory standards were introduced by the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS) to mitigate risks of large and internationally active banks including the Globally Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs). However, many jurisdictions opted to apply the Basel standards to a wider set of banks as the complex nature and resource intensiveness of the Basel III standards provoked the debate of optimising regulations to cater to the non-GSIBs, particularly smaller and non-complex banks (Restoy, 2019). Therefore, the concept of proportionality in banking regulations gained increasing attention at regional as well as global levels in view of introducing simpler regulations for small and non-complex financial institutions.",

This proposition, in the context of financial regulations, can be interpreted as scaling regulatory requirements applicable for financial institutions based on the risks posed by them on the financial system. Therefore, institutions with high importance and high systemic risk will be subject to stringent laws and regulations, while small scale and relatively simpler financial institutions will not be burdened by a high level of regulatory requirements.",

Especially in developing countries, banking institutions are bestowed with the task of promoting financial inclusion, facilitating access to credit and other development related goals where other alternative channels do not have a strong presence. For instance, small banks and regional level banks predominately play the role of a development agent assisting households, small firms and rural communities. Further, in emerging markets, frugal innovations such as payment banks have the potential to promote the convenience of internet banking and cashless payments to masses. Imposing blanket regulations on the banking sector, without due consideration of respective business models of banks makes such different roles played by banks of different scales prohibitively expensive.",

In jurisdictions where CAP is implemented, regulators categorise banks according to different qualitative and quantitative characteristics to apply specific regulatory regimes for each category of banks. In jurisdictions where SSAP is implemented, regulators establish a tailored criterion for the application of specific requirements for a subset of prudential requirements such as disclosures, liquidity ratios, large exposure limits and market risks. Despite the different criteria being used to categorise banks under the two methods, the size remains a common factor.",

This allows the regulators to link regulatory frameworks with supervisory approach and resolution strategies for the same group of banks allowing a consistent application of policy frameworks for each group of banks. On the other hand, SSAP formulates a more granular tailoring of regulatory requirements to the specific characteristics of each bank by taking its business and overall risk profile into account. Therefore, SSAP permits the adoption of regulations on specific areas precisely considering its relevance for banks\u2019 business activities and risk profile.

Also, with this methodical identification of the D-SIBs, licensed banks are segmented into two broad categories, namely, D-SIBs and non D-SIBs.

In this regard, the possibility of off-setting regulatory relief with improved capital buffers (and vice versa) remains to be explored. Further, licensed banks will also have a moral obligation towards utilising the cost savings or unencumbered capital realised through relaxed regulation for the benefit of a wider range of stakeholders of the economy. As the regulator, the Central Bank will be vigilant to prevent any room for abusing the proportionality regime or it being used as a deterrent for market-led, efficiency driven consolidation of small banks and for local banks to grow and explore cross-border opportunities in the region.",
