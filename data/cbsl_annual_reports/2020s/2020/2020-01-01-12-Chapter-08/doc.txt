8.1 OverviewT

he financial system remained resilient without

causing major macroprudential concerns,

though the performance of the sector, in

terms of expansion, credit quality and profitability

was moderated during the year. The financial sector

expansion and performance slowed down during the

year 2019 compared to the previous year mainly due

to subdued economic activities and the uncertainty

caused by the Easter Sunday attacks and the political

instability which prevailed during the year. Credit

quality of the deposit-taking financial institutions as

reflected by the Non-Performing Loans (NPL) ratio

deteriorated in 2019. However, banks and other

deposit-taking financial institutions, the major segment

of the financial sector, exhibited resilience amidst a

challenging business environment prevailed both

global and domestic contexts, by maintaining capital

and liquidity well above the regulatory minimum

requirements. Timely and appropriate regulatory and

supervisory measures assured the overall stability

of the financial system without causing any major

macroprudential concerns during the year.

In line with subdued economic activities of the

country, the total assets of the banking sector

recorded a lower growth in 2019 compared to

2018. The lower growth in banking sector assets

was an outcome of low demand for loans and

advances and tightened credit screening by banks

due to increasing NPLs. Lower demand for credit

resulted in more funds being moved towards

risk-free investments such as Treasury bills and

Treasury bonds. As a result, year-on-year growth in

investments increased considerably. The increase

in holdings of risk-free and highly liquid government

securities resulted in improvements in the Risk

Weighted Capital Adequacy Ratio (RWCAR) and

Statutory Liquid Assets Ratio (SLAR) of the banking

sector that facilitated to enhance the resilience of

the banking sector with regard to unforeseen risks.

Meanwhile, asset quality, as reflected by the NPL

ratio, recorded its lowest level since 2014. Total

borrowings of the banking sector, both in terms

of the Sri Lankan rupee and foreign currency,

decreased in 2019 compared to an increase

recorded in 2018. Meanwhile, the profitability of

the banking sector, as reflected by the Return on

Assets (ROA) ratio and Return on Equity (ROE)

ratio declined significantly during the year mainly

due to the deterioration in assets quality, rise in

operating costs and increase in taxes.

Financial Sector Performance and System Stability

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

2668

The year 2019 was challenging for the Licensed

Finance Companies (LFCs) and Specialised

Leasing Companies (SLCs) sector which showed

only a marginal expansion in the asset base

while performance of the sector deteriorated

with negative credit growth, declining profitability

and increase in NPLs. However, the sector as a

whole, maintained capital and liquidity buffers well

above the regulatory minimum levels. Meanwhile,

the NPL ratio increased significantly at the end

of 2019, on a year-on-year basis, showing signs

of deterioration in the asset quality of the sector.

This was mainly due to slowdown in the economic

activities, loss of investor confidence and declined

lending activities of the sector. The NPL ratio is

expected to rise further with the implementation of

Sri Lanka Financial Reporting Standard (SLFRS) 9.

The profitability of the sector declined significantly

during the year 2019 compared to 2018, mainly

due to increased non-interest expenses and higher

loan loss provisions against the increasing NPLs.

In order to address the issues faced by a few

LFCs in the sector, the Central Bank continued to

take prudential measures to maintain the stability

of the sector with much consideration given to

reviving business operations of the companies

with supervisory concerns. The insurance sector

performed moderately during the year 2019,

recording a growth in its assets base. Contractual

savings institutions dominated by the Employees’

Provident Fund (EPF) and the Employees’ Trust

Fund (ETF) also recorded a moderate growth

providing reasonable returns, in terms of real rate

of return for their members.

Domestic money market experienced a mixed

performance in terms of market liquidity where a

liquidity shortage prevailed until mid-April 2019 and

subsequently turned into a surplus level, except

for a limited period in the months of August and

September, during the year 2019. Downward

revision of the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR)

and conversion of International Sovereign Bond

(ISB) proceeds mainly contributed to turn the

market liquidity level from a shortfall into a surplus.

In the domestic foreign exchange market, the

Sri Lankan rupee continued to show an appreciating

trend against the US dollar throughout the year

and recorded an appreciation at the end of 2019

on a year-on-year basis. The ISB issuance in June

International Monetary Fund (IMF), and significant

contraction in the trade deficit supported to uphold

the value of the Sri Lankan rupee against the

US dollar during the period. The Colombo Stock

Exchange showed mixed developments during

2019 amidst adverse developments in domestic

and global environments. The market recorded

improvements in terms of All Share Price Index

(ASPI), market capitalisation, Price Earnings Ratio

(PER) and market capitalisation as a percentage

of GDP in 2019 while S&P SL 20 index declined

during the year and foreign outflow from CSE

continued during 2019 albeit at a lower rate than

2018.

Recognising the actions taken by Sri Lanka to

strengthen the Anti-Money Laundering (AML)

and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT)

framework of the country, Financial Actions Task

Force (FATF) delisted Sri Lanka from the Grey

List in October 2019 which will have a positive

impact on the financial sector and the economy of

Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, operations of the payments

and settlement systems of the country were well

maintained during the year without major concerns

over safety of the payment and settlement

infrastructure, and catered to the payment needs of

the economy without any major disruptions.

Going forward, operations of the banking and LFCs

& SLCs sectors will be challenging in terms of risk

management. The increasing trend of NPL ratio and

bearing additional provisions for new NPLs have

already become challenging to the banking and

LFCs & SLCs sectors. End of the moratoria, which

were granted to the tourism and Small and Medium

Enterprises (SMEs) sectors in 2019, will upwardly

push the NPL ratio and provision requirements of

the banking and LFCs & SLCs sectors. Further,

adverse economic impacts of the COVID-19

pandemic would reflect in the financial sector,

during the year 2020. Both banking and LFCs &

SLCs sectors are under immense pressure to

provide more relief to adversely affected economic

sectors due to this pandemic as there is limited

fiscal space available to provide such relief to the

affected stakeholders of the economy. Therefore,

maintaining the stability of the financial sector will

be a challenging task in the medium term.

8.2 Performance of the Banking Sector

The banking sector continued to expand

at a slower pace during the year compared to

the previous year, while exhibiting resilience

amidst a challenging business environment.

The banking sector dominated the financial sector

accounting for 62.1 per cent of total assets in the

financial system at end 2019. Credit growth of the

banking sector, which moderated during the first

half of the year largely due to the lack of demand

for credit, displayed signs of recovery towards the

second half of 2019. Deposits continued to be the

dominant source of financing for the sector, while

a decline in borrowings was observed during the

year. The banking sector profitability declined

compared to the previous year due to deteriorating

asset quality, rise in operating costs and increase

in taxes. However, the banking system maintained

capital and liquidity well above the regulatory

minimum requirements, demonstrating the

resilience of the sector.

Business Expansion

(a) Outreach: By end-2019, the banking

sector comprised 32 banks i.e. 26 Licensed

Commercial Banks (LCBs), and 6 Licensed

Specialised Banks (LSBs). The 26 LCBs include

13 branches of foreign banks. Out of these, 2

branches of foreign banks had commenced closing

procedures based on decisions taken by their head

offices. Further, Lankaputhra Development Bank

Limited was merged with Pradeshiya Sanwardana

FINANCIAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM STABILITY

Bank, while Sri Lanka Savings Bank Limited was

acquired as a subsidiary by the National Savings

Bank during the year.

The banking sector continued to support

the financial intermediation of the economy by

enhancing banking services and expanding the

banking network, thereby promoting financial

inclusion. In 2019, several banks introduced

technology based products/services to facilitate

financial inclusion. Further, 42 bank branches and

564 ATMs were established during 2019, while

11 bank branches and 13 ATMs were closed.

Accordingly, the total number of banking outlets

and ATMs had increased to 7,387 and 5,571,

respectively, by end-2019.

(b) Assets: The asset base of the banking

sector increased by Rs. 728.7 billion or

6.2 per cent during the year and surpassed

Rs. 12.5 trillion by end-2019, whereas the

growth rate recorded in 2018 was 14.6 per cent.

The challenging business environment resulting

from the Easter Sunday attacks in April 2019 and

political uncertainties that prevailed in the year

2019 led to a lower demand for credit resulting in a

lower credit growth which contributed to the decline

in assets growth. Growth in loans decreased

significantly from 19.6 per cent in 2018 to 5.6 per

cent during the year 2019. Of this 5.6 per cent

loan growth, 77.0 per cent could be attributed to

the increase in rupee loans. Increase in lending

was largely diversified across major sectors of

the economy. In terms of products, rescheduled

loans (102.2 per cent), pawning (17.0 per cent)

and credit cards (15.3 per cent) were the main

products which reported a higher growth during

2019. Meanwhile, term loans, despite being the

product with the highest increase in terms of value

(Rs. 221.6 billion) during the year, recorded

only a 5.0 per cent growth due to the high base

effect. Lower demand for credit than other years

resulted in more funds of banks to be directed

towards investments. As a result, year-on-year

growth in investments increased considerably from

4.6 per cent as at end-2018 to 12.2 per cent as

at end-2019. The held-to-maturity portfolio grew by

18.1 per cent during 2019 with increases in Treasury

bills, Treasury bonds and Sri Lanka Development

Bonds (SLDBs) by Rs. 122.1 billion, Rs. 143.9

billion and Rs. 114.6 billion, respectively. However,

investments in the trading portfolio contracted

by 7.3 per cent during 2019 with investments in

SLDBs decreasing by Rs. 116.0 billion, offsetting

the increase in investments in Treasury bills and

Treasury bonds of Rs. 52.3 billion and Rs. 22.5

billion, respectively.

(c) Liabilities: Deposits continued to

be the main source of funding representing

73.2 per cent of total liabilities of the banking

sector as at end 2019, while borrowings accounted

for 13.4 per cent. The year-on-year increase in the

deposit base in 2019 was lower than 2018. The

Importance of acknowledging the differences in banking business models in formulating regulatory policy

Regulators of the financial sector around the world began to shift towards increasingly complex and stringent regulatory frameworks in the aftermath of the global financial crisis that occurred in 2007/08. In light of this, the Basel III regulatory standards were introduced by the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS) to mitigate risks of large and internationally active banks including the Globally Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs). However, many jurisdictions opted to apply the Basel standards to a wider set of banks as the complex nature and resource intensiveness of the Basel III standards provoked the debate of optimising regulations to cater to the non-GSIBs, particularly smaller and non-complex banks (Restoy, 2019). Therefore, the concept of proportionality in banking regulations gained increasing attention at regional as well as global levels in view of introducing simpler regulations for small and non-complex financial institutions.

Introducing Proportionality

Proportionality is one of the key concepts in common law, used to convey the idea that the level of rules and laws are scaled to be in line with the expected outcome of their interventions. In simpler terms, proportionality implies that higher the risk, higher the rules and vice versa. This proposition, in the context of financial regulations, can be interpreted as scaling regulatory requirements applicable for financial institutions based on the risks posed by them on the financial system. Therefore, institutions with high importance and high systemic risk will be subject to stringent laws and regulations, while small scale and relatively simpler financial institutions will not be burdened by a high level of regulatory requirements.

Objectives of the financial sector regulators are typically associated with safeguarding financial system stability, upholding market integrity, consumer protection and promoting financial inclusion. In this regard, introducing proportionality can bring a level playing field to the market participants by implementing rules and regulations equitably without curbing market developments, healthy level of competition or limiting the diversity of market participants. This also paves the way to introduce a differentiated regulatory regime to acknowledge and facilitate financial institutions with different business models and different orientations such as development banking, payment or digital banking or rural banking that promote financial inclusion.

BOX 11Aligning Regulations with Business Models of Licensed Banks: Proportionality

The application of proportionality in financial regulations is different from applying the same for financial sector supervision. The latter is widely known as risk-based supervision, which is aimed at optimising resource allocation by the regulatory authorities giving regard to the risk profiles of the financial institutions they oversee. However, proportionality in financial regulations aims at optimising the regulatory cost for financial institutions. Despite the differences in application, the end result of incorporating proportionality in both regulatory and supervisory functions complement the objective of maintaining financial system stability in a resource efficient manner (Restoy, 2018).

The rationale for aligning regulations with the business models of banks originates from the argument that the regulations should recognise the wider role of banking institutions beyond mobilising funds. Especially in developing countries, banking institutions are bestowed with the task of promoting financial inclusion, facilitating access to credit and other development related goals where other alternative channels do not have a strong presence. For instance, small banks and regional level banks predominately play the role of a development agent assisting households, small firms and rural communities. Further, in emerging markets, frugal innovations such as payment banks have the potential to promote the convenience of internet banking and cashless payments to masses. Imposing blanket regulations on the banking sector, without due consideration of respective business models of banks makes such different roles played by banks of different scales prohibitively expensive.

Moreover, excessively high regulations for small banks without a proper justification will harm the competitiveness and undermine the level playing of business. This may not be in the best interest of customers. Also, a “disproportionate” regulatory regime would force small banks to merge or consolidate to meet high regulatory requirements. Such concentrations and ‘un-diversification’ may not be healthy for financial system stability.

Therefore, a differentiated regulatory regime based on proportionality will be in the best interest of all participants concerned: regulators, banks and customers. Jurisdictions around the world ranging from the European Union, Hong Kong, Japan, Switzerland and the USA have incorporated elements of proportionality in setting and implementing banking regulations.

Global examples of incorporating proportionality in banking regulations

Although there are different approaches adopted by regulators worldwide to incorporate proportionality in regulations, two distinct models can be identified as the basis for implementing proportionality: (a) the categorisation approach for proportionality (CAP) and (b) the specific standard approach for proportionality (SSAP) (Carvalho, et al., 2017). In jurisdictions where CAP is implemented, regulators categorise banks according to different qualitative and quantitative characteristics to apply specific regulatory regimes for each category of banks. In jurisdictions where SSAP is implemented, regulators establish a tailored criterion for the application of specific requirements for a subset of prudential requirements such as disclosures, liquidity ratios, large exposure limits and market risks. Despite the different criteria being used to categorise banks under the two methods, the size remains a common factor.

Both approaches have their own strengths. For instance, CAP establishes consistent prudential rules for banks sharing similar characteristics in a particular jurisdiction. This allows the regulators to link regulatory frameworks with supervisory approach and resolution strategies for the same group of banks allowing a consistent application of policy frameworks for each group of banks. On the other hand, SSAP formulates a more granular tailoring of regulatory requirements to the specific characteristics of each bank by taking its business and overall risk profile into account. Therefore, SSAP permits the adoption of regulations on specific areas precisely considering its relevance for banks’ business activities and risk profile. Doing so, SSAP permits reducing regulatory burdens without unduly weakening the prudential standards.

Jurisdictions such as Brazil, Japan and Switzerland are classic examples of CAP-based differentiated regulatory regimes. Brazil has divided its financial system into five categories considering the size, cross-border activities and risk profiles. Switzerland also follows a five-category classification considering total assets, assets under management, deposits insured under a deposit insurance scheme and required capital. Japan follows a two-fold classification of internationally active institutions to follow full Basel standards and non-internationally active banks to follow domestic regulations.

Jurisdictions such as the EU, where SSAP is adopted, have implemented exemptions or simplification of regulations for market risk and disclosure requirements proportionally. Similarly, the USA targets areas such as liquidity requirements, market risk and stress testing for proportionate application of regulations. Hong Kong provides exceptions in areas such as credit risk, liquidity requirements and large exposures. However, in practice, approaches followed in most other jurisdictions may use a combination of CAP and SSAP.

Applicability of proportionality in banking regulations in Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka is in the process of evaluating the possibility of incorporating proportionality in banking regulations using the elements of both CAP and SSAP. The Central Bank recently introduced a framework to deal with the Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) in line with the international timeline. Such banks were required to meet higher capital adequacy requirements, supervisory expectations in terms of tightened risk management functions, risk governance and internal controls. Also, with this methodical identification of the D-SIBs, licensed banks are segmented into two broad categories, namely, D-SIBs and non D-SIBs. Intense supervision and comprehensive regulations are applied for D-SIBs, while modified approaches are to be introduced for non D-SIBs based on proportionality.

Going forward, the regulatory process in Sri Lanka will be largely shaped by the elements of proportionality. In view of this, the upcoming Banking Act will include provisions allowing the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to implement a differentiated regulatory framework. The areas of focus for differentiated or proportionate regulations will be in terms of capital and liquidity requirements, large exposures, market risk, capital planning and supervisory review, disclosure requirements and implementing recovery and resolution planning. Complementing the shift in the regulatory process towards proportionality, licensed banks will also be strengthened and scrutinised through risk-based supervision.

Challenges and the way forward

The main challenge in implementing proportionality in the Sri Lankan context will be to strike a balance between bringing down the regulatory burden for banks, while keeping the prudential regulatory oversight intact. Therefore, reduced or relaxed regulatory requirements can only be accommodated in the areas where such simplified regulations are sufficient to ensure liquidity, solvency and long-term sustainability of the banks under consideration. In this regard, the possibility of off-setting regulatory relief with improved capital buffers (and vice versa) remains to be explored. Further, licensed banks will also have a moral obligation towards utilising the cost savings or unencumbered capital realised through relaxed regulation for the benefit of a wider range of stakeholders of the economy. As the regulator, the Central Bank will be vigilant to prevent any room for abusing the proportionality regime or it being used as a deterrent for market-led, efficiency driven consolidation of small banks and for local banks to grow and explore cross-border opportunities in the region.

deposit base increased by Rs. 669.8 billion in 2019

reaching Rs. 9.2 trillion as at end-2019 compared

with the increase of Rs. 1.1 trillion in 2018. The

growth rate in deposits declined to 7.9 per cent as

at end-2019 from 14.8 per cent as at end-2018.

Term deposits continued to be the most attractive

deposit product accounting for 78.8 per cent of the

increase in deposits during the year, and increased

its share in total deposits from 65.5 per cent as at

end-2018, to 66.5 per cent as at end-2019. Meanwhile,

savings and current account deposits accounted

for 25.6 per cent and 5.8 per cent, respectively, of

total deposits at end-2019. Accordingly, the Current

and Savings Account (CASA) ratio decreased from

32.0 per cent to 31.4 per cent over the corresponding

period. Total borrowings of the banking sector

decreased by Rs. 84.0 billion (contraction of 4.8 per

cent) in 2019 compared to the increase of Rs. 156.3

billion (9.7 per cent) in 2018. This decrease was mainly

due to the decrease in Sri Lanka rupee borrowings

which reported a negative growth of 6.3 per cent

(Rs. 47.0 billion) in 2019 and accounted for

56.0 per cent of the total decrease in borrowings.

Meanwhile, foreign currency borrowings decreased

by 3.0 per cent (US dollars 169.3 million) during

2019.

(d) Off-balance sheet exposures: A

decrease in off-balance sheet exposures was

reported in 2019 compared to 2018, reflecting

the slowdown in business activities that took

place during the year. The negative growth in

off-balance sheet exposures in 2019 was

5.3 per cent (Rs. 233.5 billion), compared to the

growth of 14.7 per cent (Rs. 569.4 billion) in 2018.

Undrawn credit lines accounted for the largest share

of off-balance sheet exposures with a share of 29.7

per cent as at end-2019. Foreign currency exposures

accounted for 28.5 per cent of the total off-balance sheet

exposures and were mainly attributed to unsettled

foreign currency purchases (14.6 per cent) and foreign

currency sales (13.9 per cent). Guarantees & bonds

(Rs. 20.0 billion), undrawn credit lines (Rs. 16.2 billion)

and documentary credit (Rs. 12.3 billion) reported an

increase, while foreign currency exposures reported

a significant decrease of 16.8 per cent (Rs. 242.0

billion).

with NPLs ratio increasing from 3.4 per cent at

the end of 2018 to 4.7 per cent at the end of 2019

mainly due to the adverse business conditions

which prevailed during the year. Accordingly, total

NPLs of the sector increased by Rs. 118.5 billion in

2019 compared to the increase of Rs. 102.5 billion

in 2018. Total loan loss provisions increased by

Rs. 48.5 billion during 2019, of which specific

provisions accounted for 99.6 per cent. However,

higher increase in NPLs resulted in a decline in

specific and total provisions coverage ratios from

43.1 per cent and 57.4 per cent, respectively, as at end-

2018 to 42.4 per cent and 52.3 per cent, respectively,

as at end-2019. Although individual banks had

diversified their businesses among various sectors in

the economy, 75.7 per cent of banking sector credit

was mainly concentrated in 6 economic sectors,

namely, consumption (18.4 per cent), construction

(15.6 per cent), wholesale & retail trade (14.2 per

cent), manufacturing (10.6 per cent), infrastructure

development (8.8 per cent) and agriculture, forestry

& fishing (8.1 per cent). Agriculture, forestry & fishing

(8.1 per cent), manufacturing (7.3 per cent), tourism

(6.4 per cent), wholesale & retail trade (6.3 per cent)

and construction (5.8 per cent) sectors reported

NPLs higher than the total banking sector average at

end-2019. Despite the increase in NPL ratios during

2019, it was still at a manageable level as the banking

sector operated with sufficient provisions and capital

buffers to absorb adverse impacts of rising NPLs.

(b) Market Risk:

The exposure of the banking sector to market

risk was minimal due to the limited exposure to

the equity market and lower net exposures to

interest rate and exchange rate movements.

Interest Rates: The interest rate sensitivity

ratio (interest bearing assets as a share of

interest bearing liabilities with maturities less

than 12 months) marginally decreased to

76.5 per cent by the end of 2019 from

77.5 per cent as at end-2018. Capital gains

on Treasury bonds reported during 2019 were

Rs. 3.4 billion and were higher than the Rs. 1.9

billion reported during 2018. This was due to more

funds being directed to government securities

during 2019 compared to 2018, the lack of

demand for loans, and the downward movement

of interest rates.

Equity Prices: Equity risk of the banking

sector was minimal due to low exposure to

equity markets. Exposure of banks’ trading

portfolio to the equity market was Rs. 15.8 billion

in 2019, which was only 0.1 per cent of total assets

and 2.7 per cent of investments held for trading.

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

2748

Exchange Rates: The net foreign currency

exposure of the banking sector recorded an

increase between end-2018 and end-2019, due to

a higher decrease in foreign currency liabilities

that offset the decrease in foreign currency

assets. Foreign currency assets comprise

on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet foreign

currency assets, while foreign currency liabilities

also comprise on and off balance sheet liabilities.

During 2019, on-balance sheet foreign currency

assets increased mainly due to the increase

in placements with banks and investments.

This increase was offset by the decrease in

off-balance sheet foreign currency assets such as

forward purchases and other derivative products,

resulting in the decline in total foreign currency

assets. Meanwhile, a marginal increase in

on-balance sheet foreign currency liabilities

resulting from increased customer deposits,

and a decline in foreign currency borrowings

due to settlements was observed during 2019.

However, off-balance sheet foreign currency

liabilities declined due to a decrease in forward

sales. This off-set the increase in on-balance

sheet foreign currency liabilities and resulted in

the decline in total foreign currency liabilities. The

net foreign currency exposure as a percentage

of banking sector on-balance sheet foreign

currency assets stood at 1.1 per cent as at

end-2019, which had marginally increased from

the 0.8 per cent recorded at end-2018. The

banking sector reported a long foreign currency

position of Rs. 16.4 billion as at end-2019 in

comparison to the long position of Rs. 11.7

billion as at end-2018. The net foreign currency

revaluation gain was Rs. 14.2 billion during 2019,

compared to Rs. 31.8 billion reported during

2018, due to the relatively lower exchange rate

movements in 2019 compared to 2018.

(c) Liquidity Risk: With more funds being

directed to liquid assets such as risk-free

government securities during 2019, the banking

sector operated with a much higher level of

liquidity. The Domestic Banking Units (DBUs)

of LCBs and LSBs are required to maintain a

minimum SLAR of 20.0 per cent in Sri Lanka

rupees while Offshore Banking Units (OBUs) are

required to maintain a minimum SLAR of 20.0 per

cent in US dollars. SLAR is calculated as the ratio

between approved liquid assets and the total of

deposits and borrowings for LCBs and the ratio

between approved liquid assets and deposits

for LSBs. The SLAR of DBU increased from

27.6 per cent as at end-2018 to 31.0 per cent as

at end-2019, while the SLAR of OBUs increased

from 45.4 per cent to 47.1 per cent during the

corresponding period. Further, lower expansion

of credit during 2019 resulted in a decrease in the

credit to deposits and borrowings ratio by 10 basis

points, while the liquid assets to total assets and

liquid assets to deposits ratios increased by 318

basis points and 377 basis points, respectively.

The Rupee and All Currency Liquidity

Coverage Ratios of the banking industry stood

at 212.8 per cent and 178.2 per cent, respectively,

by end-2019, well above the regulatory minimum

of 100 per cent. Banks are required to maintain

a Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which is the

stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets

that can be converted easily and immediately

into cash in the secondary market to meet a

bank’s liquidity needs for a period of 30 days

under a liquidity stress scenario. In addition, the

Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) introduced in

2019, which requires banks to maintain sufficient

stable funding sources, stood at 130.1 per cent at

end-2019 well above the regulatory requirement

of 100 per cent. Total liquid assets increased

by Rs. 585.3 billion during 2019 compared to

Rs. 73.3 billion during 2018. Total liquid assets

amounted to Rs. 3,621.2 billion as at end-2019,

of which investments in government securities

represented 73.0 per cent. Meanwhile, the

cumulative maturity gap as a percentage of

cumulative liabilities of the banking sector for

maturity buckets up to the “less than 12 months”

bucket, narrowed as at end-2019 compared

to end-2018, indicating better management of

assets and liabilities in the short term. Banking

sector exposure to liquidity risk was minimal due

to maintenance of adequate liquidity buffers.

Resources

(a) Profitability: The net interest margin of

the banking sector remained at the same level of

3.6 per cent by end-2018 and 2019, despite the

interest income of the banking sector growing

at a lower rate (9.3 per cent) compared to growth

in interest expenses (9.8 per cent) during 2019.

compared to the growth of 20.4 per cent during

2018 largely due to the lower credit growth during

the year. As a result, the total risk adjusted capital

ratio of the banking sector improved from 16.2

per cent as at end-2018 to 16.5 per cent as at

end-2019 despite a marginal reduction in Tier 1

capital ratio from 13.1 per cent to 13.0 per cent

over the same period.

Banks were encouraged to raise high quality

capital in 2019 due to the enhanced minimum

capital requirements which banks need to

comply with by end-2020, first day impact from

implementation of SLFRS 9 which is considered

for capital on a staggered basis over a period of

4 years and the Basel III capital requirements.

Net interest income increased by Rs. 33.5 billion

during 2019 compared to the previous year,

while non-interest income decreased by Rs.

15.4 billion. Non-interest expenses increased

by Rs. 10.5 billion, largely due to the increase

in staff cost by Rs. 5.1 billion, while loan loss

provisions increased by Rs. 19.6 billion during

2019, compared to 2018. However, losses on

trading and investment securities for the year

2019 decreased by Rs. 8.2 billion compared to

the previous year. As a result, the profit before

corporate tax was Rs. 173.0 billion in 2019 which

was Rs. 21.7 billion lower than the previous year.

Profit after tax of the banking industry was

Rs. 111.7 billion during 2019 and contracted

by 11.2 per cent compared to the previous

year. Lower profits were reflected in the worsening

of profitability ratios. ROA – before tax declined

from 1.8 per cent in 2018 to 1.4 per cent in 2019,

while ROE – after tax declined from 13.2 per cent

to 10.3 per cent over the same period. Increase in

operating costs resulted in the deterioration in the

efficiency ratio from 50.0 per cent in 2018 to 52.6

per cent in 2019.

(b) Capital: The banking sector was in

compliance with the capital requirements

during 2019. Risk weighted assets of the banking

sector grew only by 3.8 per cent during 2019

During 2019, banks had raised Tier I capital through

issuance of new shares (Rs. 24.0 billion), retention

of profits (Rs. 53.3 billion) and buildup of reserves

(Rs. 29.9 billion). The regulatory capital of the

banking sector reported a growth of 13.8 per cent

during the year, of which Tier 1 capital contributed

to 71.1 per cent. The total regulatory capital base of

the banking industry amounted to Rs. 1,181.1 billion

as at end-2019, of which Tier I capital represented

78.6 per cent. Tier II capital increased by Rs. 41.3

billion during 2019, mainly due to the increase in

provisions (Rs. 24.0 billion) and subordinated debt

capital (Rs. 18.5 billion) of banks.

The Central Bank introduced a new

framework for dealing with Domestic

Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) effective

from 20 December 2019, which is in line with

international standards. Accordingly, four D-SIBs

which account for around 55 per cent of the total

banking sector assets have been identified under

the new framework. These D-SIBs are required

to maintain varying higher loss absorbency

requirements ranging from 1.0 per cent to

1.5 per cent. Going forward, licensed banks

designated as D-SIBs will be subject to intense

supervision, higher supervisory expectations on risk

management, governance and internal controls.

Supervisory and Regulatory Developments

During 2019, the Central Bank continued

to introduce prudential policy measures and

regulations with a view of enhancing the safety

and soundness of the banking sector and

facilitating business expansion of banks. Further,

the Central Bank completed the implementation of

key regulatory elements of the Basel III framework

by 01 January 2019 and facilitated consistent

adoption of the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard -

SLFRS 9 - Financial Instruments for the banking

sector in Sri Lanka.

Considering the need to employ expatriate

officers with appropriate management skills

and technical expertise, guidelines were

issued to licensed banks on the employment of

expatriates in licensed banks. These guidelines

provide a definition on the term ‘expatriate officer’

and provide eligibility criteria for appointment

of expatriate officers for banks incorporated in

Sri Lanka and banks incorporated outside Sri Lanka.

A new set of formats for financial statements

that is in line with SLFRS 9 was specified. A

Circular on the Publication of Annual and Quarterly

Financial Statements and Other Disclosures by

Licensed Banks was issued specifying a new set of

formats to publish financial statements in line with

the new Sri Lanka Accounting Standard - SLFRS

9 - Financial Instruments, replacing the existing

formats.

In order to prevent the undermining of

the interest rate policies of the Central Bank,

licensed banks were required to refrain from

conducting lottery schemes/raffle draws

and gift schemes that could result in a

disadvantageous situation for the customers,

where features of a financial product/service are

distorted. This measure was taken since offering

non-interest based incentive schemes for mobilising

interest bearing savings and time deposits create

undue competition among licensed banks, which

undermines the interest rate policies implemented

by the Central Bank. However, banks may conduct

seasonal/promotional gift schemes provided that

all customers of the relevant product, service,

or category of the product/service, receive the

offered gift, applicable market interest rates are

offered based on the nature of the product, cost

of the gift is not charged to customers, and no

additional terms and conditions are imposed on

customers with respect to the gifts offered.

In view of the gradual improvements in the

trade balance, certain regulations issued in

2018 imposing restrictions on imports, were

withdrawn in 2019. Accordingly, a Circular was

issued to licensed banks informing of the removal

of restrictions on opening of Letters of Credit (LCs)

for the importation of motor vehicles under permits

on concessionary terms. Similarly, Banking Act

Directions issued to National Savings Bank on

measures to curtail imports of motor vehicles were

withdrawn. Further, the previous Circular “Margin

Requirements against Imports on Documents

against Acceptance (DA) Terms” dated 11

October 2018, which was initially issued to impose

restrictions on imports under DA terms was also

withdrawn with effect from 13 March 2019.

Considering the high real interest rates on

deposits and lending products prevailing in

the economy and the need to strengthen and

expedite monetary policy transmission through

the financial system, two key regulations were

issued to licensed banks by the Central Bank to

reduce market interest rates. Initially, a Monetary

Law Act (MLA) Order No. 01 of 2019 was issued

on maximum interest rates to be paid in respect of

rupee deposits, enabling licensed banks to reduce

their cost of funds and thereby reduce the interest

rates on lending to enhance credit flows to the real

economy. Subsequently, with a view to enhancing

the efficiency of the transmission of recent policy

decisions to rupee denominated market lending

rates, Monetary Law Act Order No. 02 of 2019 was

issued requiring licensed banks to reduce rupee

lending rates by at least 200 bps by 15 October

2019, in comparison to the interest rates applicable

as at 30 April 2019, subject to certain exclusions

and a floor rate of 12.5 per cent p.a. Further, all

LCBs were instructed to reduce its Average

Weighted Prime Lending Rate (AWPR) by 250 bps

by 27 December 2019 compared to its AWPR as

published by the Central Bank as at 26 April 2019,

subject to a maximum interest rate of 9.5 per cent

p.a. In addition, maximum interest rate ceilings of

28 per cent p.a. and 24 per cent p.a. were imposed on

credit card advances and pre-arranged temporary

overdrafts, respectively, commencing 01 November

2019. The penal interest rate was capped at

4.00 per cent p.a., with effect from 15 October

2019. With the issuance of the above Order, MLA

Order No. 01 of 2019 on maximum interest rates on

rupee denominated deposits was withdrawn.

With a view to enhancing credit flows to

SMEs, the Central Bank issued Directions to

licensed banks on identifying SMEs for the

purpose of capital and liquidity standards under

the Basel III regulatory framework. Accordingly,

the identification criteria of SMEs under Basel

requirements were amended and banks are to

adopt an internal mechanism approved by the

Board of Directors to verify the annual turnover

of SMEs. Further, a supplement to Circular No. 4

of 2018 on the adoption of Sri Lanka Accounting

Standard-SLFRS 9: Financial Instruments in

licensed banks was issued to licensed banks to

further support enhancing credit flows to SMEs.

In view of the adverse impact on the tourism

industry due to the Easter Sunday attacks,

a Circular was issued to licensed banks

requesting to grant concessions to individuals

and entities in the tourism industry who wish

FINANCIAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM STABILITY

279

to avail such concessions. Accordingly, licensed

banks were allowed to grant a moratorium, on a case-

by-case basis, to individuals and entities who are

registered with the Sri Lanka Tourism Development

Authority (SLTDA) or any other authority/ agency

under SLTDA to provide services relating to tourism.

Licensed banks were instructed to convert the capital

and interest falling due during the moratorium period

into a term loan with a concessionary interest rate,

which shall be recovered from July 2020 onwards.

Banking Act Directions were issued to

licensed banks amending the maximum Loan to

Value (LTV) ratios applicable for credit facilities

granted for purchase or utilisation of electric,

hybrid and other unregistered vehicles and

registered vehicles which have been used in

Sri Lanka for more/less than one year after the

first registration. In addition, banks were required

to consider the proforma invoice value, instead of the

market value of the motor vehicle when determining

the value considered for the LTV ratio with respect

to credit facilities granted for the importation of

motor vehicles under permits on concessionary

terms. Further, these Directions were amended

subsequently to increase the LTV ratio applicable

for unregistered non-electric motor cars purchased

under the ‘Mini Taxi’ concessionary loan scheme of

the ‘Enterprise Sri Lanka’ programme to 80 per cent.

A regulatory framework was introduced

to ensure that market conduct and treasury

operations of licensed banks are carried out

prudently and in line with international best

practices. Accordingly, Banking Act Directions in

this regard were issued to licensed banks, and the

regulatory framework includes, inter alia, market

conduct and ethical practices, confidentiality

requirements, procedure for recording deal

conversations, risk management principles,

professionalism and knowledge level, and sanctions

on non-compliance with the Directions.

In terms of the provisions of Sections 38A

and 76H of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988

(as amended) the Central Bank reviewed the

list of qualified auditors to conduct audits

of licensed banks and selected a new list of

qualified auditors to audit accounts of licensed

banks, from the financial year commencing

01 January 2021. The existing assessment

criteria for the selection of qualified auditors

were strengthened in line with the changes in the

banking sector landscape, changes in accounting

and auditing professions, introduction of the Basel

III framework and Sri Lanka Accounting Standard

- SLFRS 9 - Financial Instruments and the ability

and competencies of the audit firms to undertake

forensic audits and information technology audits

of licensed banks.

Amendments were introduced to the

existing regulatory framework on valuation

of immovable properties of licensed banks.

Accordingly, Banking Act Directions were issued

amending the eligibility criteria for valuers

under the regulatory framework on valuation of

immovable properties of licensed banks.

During 2019, fit and proper assessment

criteria for the appointment of Directors, Chief

Executive Officers and Key Management

Personnel of licensed banks were further

strengthened. Accordingly, Banking Act

Directions were issued on the assessment of

fitness and propriety of Directors of licensed

banks, including the information to be submitted

by the persons proposed to be appointed, elected

or nominated as Directors of licensed banks and

for the annual reassessment of such Directors

for the purpose of obtaining approval from the

Director of Bank Supervision Department of the

Central Bank. Previous circulars issued in this

regard were revoked. Further, a Banking Act

Determination was issued designating certain

positions as officers performing executive functions

in licensed banks and requiring such officers and

Chief Executive Officers of licensed banks to

furnish information in a format prescribed by the

Central Bank to assess/re-assess their fitness and

propriety prior to appointment/periodically for the

purpose of obtaining the approval of the Director of

Bank Supervision Department of the Central Bank.

Previous Determinations and Circulars issued in

this regard were revoked. Moreover, Banking Act

Directions on Corporate Governance for licensed

banks were amended introducing a cooling off

period of 6 months for the appointment of a

Director or a Chief Executive Officer of a licensed

bank operating in Sri Lanka as a Director or a Chief

Executive Officer of another licensed bank.

With a view to broad-basing assessment

criteria applicable to “Domestic Systemically

Important Banks” in line with international

standards and best practices, the Central

Bank introduced a new framework to assess

D-SIBs based on multiple factors such as

size, interconnectedness, substitutability

and complexity. Licensed banks determined as

D-SIBs are required to maintain additional Higher

Loss Absorbency (HLA) requirements as a capital

surcharge. In this regard, Banking Act Directions

were issued determining four licensed banks

as D-SIBs and specifying their respective HLA

requirements. Further, Banking Act Directions on

Capital Requirements under Basel III were amended

incorporating additional HLA requirements in the

form of Common Equity Tier 1 for D-SIBs.

Crisis preparedness and resilience of

banks to face adverse scenarios will be further

strengthened through the implementation of

recovery plans for licensed banks. Licensed

banks will be required to implement recovery plans

in order to minimise the adverse impact on troubled

banks and spill-over effects to the financial sector.

A Consultation Paper was issued to banks in this

regard for their observations, and the Banking Act

Directions providing guidelines for preparations

of recovery plans by banks will be issued in due

course.

The Central Bank further improved the “Bank

Sustainability Rating Indicator (BSRI)”, the

supervisory rating model which was developed

to facilitate the risk based supervision

framework of licensed banks. All parameters

were reviewed and a comprehensive supervisory

guidance framework was developed to uphold

the consistent application of the BSRI framework

across all banks. Implementation of the BSRI would

enable early intervention and prompt corrective

action through the identification of potential risks

arising from emerging developments and strategic

changes of licensed banks.

The Central Bank engaged in strengthening

the regulatory and supervisory framework

of licensed banks by initiating the drafting of

a new Banking Act, in line with the changing

dynamics of the banking sector, international

standards and regional best practices. Key areas

to be incorporated into the proposed new Banking

Act include an overall mandate for supervision and

regulation, a differentiated regulatory framework

to facilitate proportionality, strengthening

corporate governance, consolidated supervision,

resolution, imposing monetary penalties/fines,

ring-fencing of banks to mitigate contagion risk,

strengthening provisions for mergers, acquisitions

and consolidation, subsidiarisation of large foreign

banks and a financial holding company structure

for banks. A consultation paper comprising the

key concepts proposed to be covered in the new

Banking Act was issued to licensed banks and other

stakeholders for their comments and observations.

The Central Bank expects to complete enacting the

new Banking Act by early 2021.

FINANCIAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM STABILITY

281

8.3 Performance of Non-Bank Financial Institutions

Licensed Finance Companies and Specialised Leasing Companies Sector

The LFCs and SLCs sector performance

deteriorated during the year, with negative

credit growth, declining profitability and

increase in NPLs. The slowdown in the sector

was mainly due to subdued economic activities,

prevailed political uncertainty, lack of investor

confidence and security concerns created by the

Easter Sunday attacks. Total assets of the sector

stood at Rs. 1,432.7 billion by end-December

2019, representing 7.6 per cent of Sri Lanka’s

financial system. The sector as a whole remained

stable, with capital maintained at healthy levels

along with adequate liquidity buffers well above the

regulatory minimum levels. Deposits dominated

the funding mix, as increased assets were mainly

funded through deposits, while borrowings of

the sector largely declined compared to the

previous year. The Central Bank continued to

take prudential measures to maintain the stability

of the sector with much consideration on reviving

LFCs with supervisory concerns.

Business Expansion

(a) Outreach: At end-2019, the sector

comprised 42 LFCs and 4 SLCs. LFCs and SLCs

contributed to the economy by providing enhanced

services to the customers and expanding its branch

network, thereby promoting financial inclusion in

the country. There were 1,432 branches and 599

other outlets1 of the LFCs and SLCs sector, out of

which 952 branches (66.0 per cent) were located

outside the Western Province. In 2019, several

LFCs introduced technology based products/

services to facilitate financial inclusion.

1 Other outlets mean service centers, pawning centers, collection centers which do not mobilise public deposits.

(b) Assets: Total asset base of the sector

stood at Rs. 1,432.7 billion, which expanded

marginally by 0.1 per cent (Rs. 1.3 billion)

during the year, compared to 5.6 per cent

growth reported in 2018. The asset base of the

sector mainly consisted of loans and advances

which accounted for 77.0 per cent of the total

assets. Finance leases accounted for the major

part, representing 52.9 per cent of the gross loans

and advances, followed by other secured loans,

representing 37.0 per cent.

Lending Activities of the sector showed signs

of slowing down during 2019. This has been in

response to macroprudential policy measures to

curtail importation of motor vehicles and lending

towards vehicles such as the directions of LTV

ratios for credit facilities granted in respect of motor

vehicles, prevailed higher market interest rates

on lending, sluggish economic and commercial

activities due to loss of business confidence which

resulted from political instability in the run up to

the presidential election and negative sentiments

caused by the Easter Sunday attacks. Credit

provided by the LFCs and SLCs sector declined

by 3.0 per cent (Rs. 34.3 billion) to Rs.1,102.7

billion, compared to the growth of 7.6 per cent

in the corresponding period of 2018. Loans and

advances portfolio of product categories such as

finance leases (Rs. 3.9 billion), secured loans and

advances (Rs. 20.8 billion) and hire purchases

(Rs. 4.3 billion) contracted, while pawning

advances increased by Rs. 15.5 billion and loans

against deposits increased by Rs. 0.6 billion.

The investment portfolio of LFCs and SLCs

sector comprises investments in equities,

capital market debt instruments, government

securities and investment properties. The

investment portfolio recorded a sharp increase of

20.5 per cent (Rs. 22.5 billion) in 2019, compared

to a negative growth of 7.1 per cent in 2018.

This is mainly due to increased investment in

government securities maturing in less than 12

months (Rs. 9.0 billion), investment in shares,

units and debt securities held for trading (Rs. 8.0

billion) and investment properties (Rs. 7.1 billion).

Other assets were mainly maintained in the

form of cash, balances with banks and financial

institutions, trading stocks, and fixed assets,

which increased by 7.1 per cent (Rs. 13.2 billion)

in 2019, largely due to increased placements in

banks and financial institutions.

(c) Liabilities: Customer deposits still

dominated the major portion of liabilities, and

increased assets were mainly funded through

deposits, which accounted for 52.8 per cent

of the total liabilities of the sector. The deposit

growth accelerated to 5.6 per cent (Rs. 39.9

billion), while borrowings declined by 12.6 per

cent (Rs. 58.2 billion) in 2019.

Capital position improved due to

the enhancement of regulatory capital

requirements. The equity capital of the sector

increased by 10.6 per cent (Rs. 19.5 billion),

which stood at Rs. 203.2 billion by end-2019,

mainly on account of the increase in capital due to

the steps taken by LFCs to enhance the minimum

core capital to meet Rs. 2.0 billion requirements

by 1 January 2020. The sector’s core capital and

total RWCARs stood at 11.1 per cent and 12.5

per cent, respectively, by end-December 2019,

compared to the reported levels of 9.8 per cent

and 11.1 per cent in the corresponding period of

2018.

Risks in the LFCs and SLCs Sector

(a) Credit Risk: The gross non-performing

advances (NPA) ratio increased to 10.6 per

cent at end-December 2019, from 7.7 per cent

reported at end-December 2018, reflecting

deterioration in the asset quality of the sector.

This is mainly due to the slowing down in economic

activities due to the Easter Sunday attacks,

declined lending activities of the sector and

spillover effects of the Debt Relief Program. The

provision coverage ratio slightly deteriorated to

56.6 per cent by end-December 2019, compared

to 57.0 per cent reported at end-December 2018.

With the implementation of SLFRS 9, NPA will

rise further which would highlight the significant

credit risk of the sector.

(b) Market Risk: The sector continued to

experience minimum equity risk. However, in

essence, the sector is considered to be largely

exposed to interest rate risk.

Interest Rate Risk: In response to the maximum

interest rates on deposits and debt instruments

imposed on LFCs, cost of funds declined and

lending rates also reduced to some extent with the

new loans and advances granted. Accordingly,

interest rate risk of the sector decelerated with

the prevailing negative mismatch in the maturity

profile of the interest-bearing assets and liabilities.

Equity Risk: Equity risk of the sector remained

low during the year as exposure to the equity

market in the form of investment in listed shares

held for trading was minimal at Rs. 14.0 billion,

which was only 1.0 per cent of the total assets of

the sector.

(c) Liquidity Risk: The sector maintained

adequate liquidity buffers well above the regulatory

minimum levels. The overall regulatory liquid

assets available in the sector at end-December

2019 indicated a surplus of Rs. 41.6 billion as

against the stipulated minimum requirement of

Rs. 89.8 billion. The liquidity ratio (liquid assets on

deposits and borrowing) increased to 11.3 per cent

at end-December 2019, compared to 9.6 per cent

recorded at end-December 2018.

Profitability and Capital Resources

(a) Profitability: Net interest income of the

sector during the year was Rs. 117.4 billion,

which increased by 7.9 per cent (Rs. 8.6 billion).

This was due to the combined effects of increased

interest income by 7.6 per cent (Rs. 18.3 billion)

and increased interest expenses by 7.4 per cent

(Rs. 9.8 billion). Net interest margin of the sector (net

interest income as a percentage of average assets)

increased to 7.7 per cent in 2019 from 7.4 per cent

in 2018, due to the combined effects of increased net

interest income (7.9 per cent) and increased (gross)

average assets (4.3 per cent).

Non-interest income increased by 3.4 per cent

(Rs. 1.3 billion) mainly due to increase in default

charges and other service charges, while non-

interest expenses increased by 15.5 per cent

(Rs. 12.6 billion) affecting sector profitability in an

adverse manner. Non-interest expenses increased

mainly due to increased administrative expenses (Rs.

4.1 billion), loss on valuation/ disposal of repossessed

items (Rs. 2.7 billion), staff costs (Rs. 2.5 billion)

and other expenses (Rs. 1.3 billion). The loan loss

provisions made against NPAs during the year was

Rs. 30.2 billion, which increased by 16.2 per cent

(Rs. 4.2 billion), when compared to the provision

made in 2018.

The sector posted a profit after tax of Rs. 14.5

billion, a decline of 31.9 per cent compared to

the profit recorded in year 2018, mainly due to

increased non-interest expenses and higher loan

loss provisions. ROA also decreased by 56 basis

points during the year, reporting a ratio of 2.2 per cent,

and ROE decreased by 463 basis points, reporting a

ratio of 7.5 per cent which shows signs of stress in the

sector profitability.

(b) Capital: The sector remained resilient with

capital maintained at healthy levels during the

year. The total regulatory capital levels improved

by Rs. 22.3 billion in 2019, compared to the figures

reported in 2018, mainly due to the enhancement of

minimum capital requirement by the Central Bank to

Rs. 2.0 billion by 01 January 2020 and Rs. 2.5 billion

by 01 January 2021. The regulatory capital comprises

Tier I and Tier II capital, of which Tier I capital

contributed to 95.1 per cent of the total regulatory

capital. Tier I capital mainly comprises issued share

capital, statutory reserve fund and published retained

profits.

soundness of the sector to preserve customer

confidence. A Direction was issued to introduce

maximum interest rates on deposits and debt

instruments of the LFCs and SLCs, considering

the high real interest rates on deposits and

high rates on lending products observed in the

economy and the need to strengthen and expedite

monetary policy transmission through the financial

system, while enhancing credit flows to the real

economy. This Direction was revised subsequently

in consideration of requests made by the LFCs to

remain competitive in the market and also to reduce

the impact on profits of LFCs.

The existing LTV Direction issued to LFCs

was revised to incorporate the 2019 Budget

proposals by allowing higher LTV ratios for

light trucks. The earlier 70 per cent LTV ratio in

respect to light trucks was revised to an increased

ratio of 90 per cent.

The existing Direction on Valuation of

Immovable Properties issued to LFCs and SLCs

was revised. The eligibility criteria for valuers was

updated and the frequency of valuation for different

categories of assets classes was amended.

Accordingly, valuation of residential property which

is occupied by the borrower for residential purposes

obtained as collateral against loans and advances

that are non-performing, shall be carried out in a

less than five years frequency, and in respect to all

other credit facilities, the valuation shall be carried

out in a less than four years frequency. Valuation

of immovable property obtained as collateral

against loans and advances which are performing,

shall be made at the time of initial granting and

at a time of any subsequent enhancement of

credit facilities. Revaluation of land, and land &

building which are purchased or acquired for the

purpose of conducting business of LFCs which are

measured and disclosed in accordance with LKAS

The sector’s core capital and total RWCAR

stood at 11.1 per cent and 12.5 per cent,

respectively, in 2019 which increased by

1.3 per cent and 1.4 per cent from the reported

ratios in 2018. LFCs and SLCs with assets less

than Rs. 100.0 billion are required to maintain Tier

I capital adequacy ratio of 6.5 per cent and Total

capital ratio of 10.5 per cent, whereas LFCs and

SLCs with assets of Rs. 100.0 billion and above are

required to maintain Tier I capital adequacy ratio of

7.0 per cent and Total capital ratio of 11.0 per cent,

with effect from 1 July 2019.

There were a few LFCs that were non-compliant

with the minimum core capital requirement

and/or with the minimum capital adequacy

ratios. Several regulatory actions were initiated to

avoid further deterioration of the financial position,

maintain the stability of such institutions and

safeguard the interest of depositors.

Supervisory and Regulatory Developments

Throughout 2019, the Central Bank introduced

several policy measures and prudential

regulations to further strengthen the

supervisory and regulatory framework of

LFCs and SLCs for enhancing the stability and

significant volatile changes in fair value.

A Circular was issued to LFCs and SLCs in view

of mitigating the adverse impact on the tourism

sector due to the Easter Sunday attacks. This

enabled these institutions to grant a moratorium to

individuals and entities who have registered with

the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority or

any other authority/agency to provide services to

the tourism sector. Several explanatory notes were

issued following the circular with more clarifications,

specific instructions and reporting requirements on

LFCs and SLCs.

Under the Extraordinary Gazette No.2125/58,

regulations were issued on the priority of

claims in a winding up of an LFC. Accordingly,

the liquidator shall pay out of the assets of the

LFC the expenses, fees and claims according to

its tenor to the extent and in the order of priority

set-out in the Schedule to the said regulation. After

paying the preferential claims in accordance with

the regulations, only thereafter shall the liquidator

apply the assets of the company in satisfaction of

all other claims in accordance with provisions of the

Companies Act No. 7 of 2007.

A consultation paper was issued on introducing

ownership limits to LFCs, with the objective of

diversifying the ownership of shares in LFCs.

Over the past few years there has been an increase

in the prominence of the LFCs sector in terms of

its market penetration and its contribution towards

financial inclusion of the country. However, due to

various reasons there have been instances where

several LFCs have either failed or become almost

bankrupt during the last few decades. Introducing

ownership limits on LFCs is viewed as an important

part of the process of strengthening good corporate

governance practices in this sector. Based on the

observations received from the stakeholders on

the first consultation paper, a second consultation

paper was issued for observations during the latter

part of the year.

A consultation paper was issued on credit risk

management for LFCs. The existing directions

on credit risk management are outdated and

create a distortion in the treatment of NPLs in

the LFCs and SLCs sector. Thus, credit risk

directions need to be changed regularly to keep

pace with international and local developments in

the financial industry, emerging international best

practices emanating in the Basel Committee on

Bank Supervision, accounting standards and to

be compliant with other standard setting bodies.

Meanwhile, in order to maintain the confidence of

the public in the financial system, the Central Bank

continued with litigation relating to unauthorised

finance companies, prohibited schemes and other

issues in the financial sector, with the assistance

of the Attorney General’s Department and other

law enforcement agencies under the provisions of

the Finance Business Act, No. 42 of 2011 and the

Banking Act, No. 30 of 1988.

Primary Dealers in Government Securities

Currently, there are 7 Licensed Commercial

Banks and 8 companies are in operation

as Primary Dealers. Out of those, Perpetual

Treasuries Limited (PTL) and Pan Asia Banking

Corporation PLC (PABC), were suspended from

carrying on business and activities of a Primary

Dealer (PTL w.e.f. 6 July 2017 and PABC w.e.f.

15 August 2017). Participation in government

securities Primary Auctions was prohibited for

Entrust Securities PLC (ESP) w.e.f. 24 July 2017.

Therefore, currently 6 Licensed Commercial Banks

(LCBs) and 6 Primary Dealer Companies (PDs)

are active in the PD industry in the government

securities market.

Assets and Liabilities

Assets and Liabilities: The total assets of PDs

decreased by 7.2 per cent to Rs. 77.5 billion in

2019. The total investment portfolio of government

securities, consisting of trading, available for sale

and held to maturity amounted to Rs. 69.3 billion at

end-2019, recording a decrease of 9.6 per cent

during the year. This change was due to decreases in

the trading portfolio, held to maturity portfolio and the

available for sale portfolio of government securities.

The trading portfolio decreased to Rs. 57.5 billion

by end-2019, from Rs. 62.8 billion recorded at

end-2018; the held to maturity portfolio decreased

to Rs. 8.6 billion in end-2019 from Rs. 8.7 billion in

end-2018, and the available for sale portfolio,

decreased to Rs. 3.3 billion during 2019 compared

to Rs. 5.2 billion as at end-2018.

Profitability: The PDs reported profit after tax of

Rs. 3.8 billion during 2019 against that of Rs. 0.2

billion during 2018 indicating a significant market

improvement. The significant increase in the

capital gain and large revaluation gain recorded

in 2019 against the revaluation losses from the

government securities in 2018 largely contributed

to the increase in profits. Consequently, ROA and

ROE for PDs increased to 6.0 per cent and 28.5 per

cent, respectively, by end-2019 from negative 0.02

per cent and 2.0 per cent recorded in 2018,

respectively.

Capital: Equity of PDs considerably increased by

31.5 per cent largely due to the accumulation of

profits during the year. The RWCAR of the PDs was

above the minimum RWCAR of 10 per cent while

the ratio increased to 27.6 per cent at end-2019 from

21.3 per cent as at end-2018.

Exposure to Risks

Market Risk: The proportion of trading portfolio

to total investment portfolio of PDs did not change

notably and recorded 82.9 per cent at end-2019

compared to 81.9 per cent at end-2018, reflecting

a marginal increase in the market risk exposure of

the industry.

Liquidity Risk: The overall liquidity risk exposure

of standalone PDs decreased due to the decrease in

over-night negative mismatch in the maturity profile

of assets and liabilities of the industry by end-2019.

The overnight negative mismatch decreased to

Rs. 11.1 billion or 72.1 per cent of the overnight

liabilities at end-2019, from Rs. 36.3 billion or

91.9 per cent at end-2018. In view of holding a

Background

Government securities are debt instruments issued by a government to borrow money to fund its expenditure. In the Sri Lankan context, the most common rupee denominated government securities are Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds. Treasury Bills are issued for a maximum tenor of one year while Treasury Bonds are issued for tenors of over one year and typically up to 30 years. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), as the statutory manager of government debt, is tasked with the issuance and management of Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds on behalf of the government, in terms of the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance No. 8 of 1923 (LTBO) and the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance No. 7 of 1937 (RSSO), respectively.

Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds were issued in paper form, i.e., as printed certificates, until 2004. In 2004, by way of necessary amendments to the legislation, the outstanding Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds were converted into scripless form and the issuance of new Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds in scripless form was initiated. A digital depository, namely the Central Depository System (CDS), is maintained by the CBSL to record the ownership of these scripless Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds.

Efficient functioning of the government securities market is an essential prerequisite in ensuring that funds are sourced for the government at optimal cost. Development of the government securities market by improving and standardising market practices on repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions on Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds is a critical aspect to this end.

Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Transactions in Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds

A repurchase transaction is a transaction where a person who owns a Treasury Bill or a Treasury Bond sells it to another person at a particular price with the agreement to buy back on an agreed future date, at an agreed price. In effect, the person who owns the security is borrowing funds using that security as collateral. The difference between the selling price of the security and the buyback price of the security is the interest cost for borrowing funds. A reverse repurchase transaction, on the other hand, is a lending transaction collateralised by a Treasury Bill or a Treasury Bond, i.e., the inverse of a repurchase transaction.

BOX 12Standardising the Market Practices for Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Transactions in Government Securities

RSSO and LTBO Direction No. 01 of 2019 on Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Transactions of Dealer Direct Participants in Scripless Treasury Bonds and Scripless Treasury Bills

The CBSL, on 20.12.2019, in terms of the powers conferred by the RSSO and the LTBO, issued Directions to Dealer Direct Participants (DDPs),1 prescribing the manner in which repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions on scripless Treasury Bills and scripless Treasury Bonds shall be carried out by such DDPs. These Directions were intended to standardise the basic parameters of repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions while leaving space for effective market-making, enabling parties to enter into repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions in a transparent manner. Directions were also intended to address the shortfalls in the regulatory framework identified during the failure of one of the Primary Dealers and the supervision of other DDPs. These Directions came into operation on 01.01.2020 subject to certain transitional provisions aimed at providing market participants with adequate time to make necessary adjustments to their existing practices.

Salient Features of the New Directions

1. Uniformity in valuing securities

The new Directions recommend that the Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds used for repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions be priced at market value based on the dirty price, i.e. the price inclusive of accrued interest, corresponding to the average of the bid and offer quotes for the relevant Bill or Bond published daily by the CBSL. However, in recognition of other valuation methods available to DDPs to derive accurate valuations, DDPs have also been allowed the option of using an alternative valuation method subject to certain conditions.

2. Introduction of minimum haircut requirements

A haircut is the discount applied on the market value of Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds when such Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds are used for repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions. A haircut is a universally accepted concept that is developed to mitigate the risk posed to the lender due to adverse movements in the price of underlying securities. In the past, haircut percentages for securities used for repurchase and reverse repurchase

1 DDPs are persons appointed as DDPs in terms of the RSSO and LTBO, and at present include all Licensed Commercial Banks and Primary Dealers Companies.

transactions varied greatly among DDPs. However, in order to introduce a degree of standardisation to the repo market, the new Directions imposed the following minimum haircut requirements, at the time of entering into repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions, which are based on the remaining term to maturity of the Treasury Bill or the Treasury Bond, excluding transactions between two Direct Participants (DPs)2.

Table B 12.1 Minimum haircut requirements

up to 1 year4.0more than 1 year and up to 3 years6.0more than 3 years and up to 5 years8.0more than 5 years and up to 8 years10.0more than 8 years12.0

3. Streamlining the sale, substitution and replenishment of securities used for repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions

While the existing regulatory framework contained provisions to safeguard the interest of both lenders and borrowers in repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions, the new Directions introduced several further measures including the prohibition of outright selling of securities received by a DDP as collateral for reverse repurchase transaction and requiring DDPs to simultaneously substitute securities used for repurchase transactions if such securities are to be used by the DDPs. Further, the new Directions require DDPs to allocate or obtain additional securities, depending on the type of transaction, if the market value of securities used for a repurchase or reverse repurchase transaction falls below the maturity value of the transaction at any time prior to its maturity.

2 DPs are persons appointed as DPs in terms of the RSSO and LTBO, and at present include the CBSL, all Licensed Commercial Banks, Primary Dealers Companies, Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) and the Central Depositary System of the Colombo Stock Exchange.

4. Improving accountability and risk management practices of DDPs

The new Directions, while mandating certain key requirements with respect to repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions, recognise the importance of robust internal structures in DDPs to ensure the safety and soundness of the repurchase and reverse repurchase market. Accordingly, the responsibilities of the Board of Directors of DDPs, roles of the internal and external auditors, risk management and compliance functions of DDPs are drawn.

5. Introduction of penalties

While the existing framework provided for several regulatory actions that could be taken against DDPs who fail to comply with the requirements with respect to repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions, the new Directions impose financial penalties to further curb such non-compliances.

Expected Benefits to the Government Securities Market and its Participants

Tradability of government securities, in terms of both outright and repo trading, is a key factor affecting the cost of funds for the government, as investors prefer to invest in liquid securities. These new Directions on repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions in Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds will further strengthen the market practices relating to such transactions and thereby improve the tradability of government securities.

Further, protection of DDPs and their customers who engage in repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions will be further strengthened as the measures introduced by these Directions are effectively coupled with safeguards already put in place by the CBSL, such as the Short Message Service (SMS) and e-mail notification system for CDS accountholders, whereby security movements with respect to repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions are notified to customers.

The above benefits will lead to the development of the government securities market as a whole and enhance investor confidence.

PDs and also the ability to use such government

securities as collateral for obtaining funds to bridge

any unforeseen liquidity gaps, the liquidity risk

profile of PDs remained low throughout the year

except for one PD that was facing liquidity issues.

Most of the PDs had stand-by contingency funding

arrangements to bridge liquidity gaps.

Market Participation

Primary Market Activities: The participation

in primary market auctions in respect of Treasury

bills and Treasury bonds by PDs showed a mixed

performance. Of the total bids accepted from the

total Treasury bills auctions (52) conducted in

2019, the participation of LCBs, PDs and EPF

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

2908

account for 70.9 per cent, 28.3 per cent and

0.8 per cent respectively. However, participation of

Treasury bond auctions in 2019 was dominated by

the EPF with a 41.1 per cent share from the total

bonds accepted through 12 auctions conducted in

2019.

Secondary Market Activities: Secondary

market transactions in government securities

increased by 7.7 per cent to Rs. 8,108.4 billion, out of

which repo transactions accounted for 79.7 per cent

of the total volume of secondary market transactions

in 2019. During 2019, outright purchases and outright

sales increased by 37.8 per cent and 23.0 per cent

respectively, compared to 2018.

Supervisory and Regulatory

Developments

Several regulatory and supervisory

measures were taken on primary dealers during

2019. In order to standardise the market practice on

repurchase transactions of government securities,

a Direction dated 20 December 2019 was issued

to Dealer Direct Participants relating to repurchase

and reverse repurchase transactions on Scripless

Treasury Bonds and Scripless Treasury Bills.

Licensed Microfinance Companies

Three microfinance companies were granted

licences under the Microfinance Act, No. 6 of

2016 by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank;

namely, Berendina Micro Investments Company

Limited, Lak Jaya Micro Finance Limited and

Dumbara Micro Credit Limited. The Licensed

Microfinance Companies (LMFC) sector reported

assets worth Rs. 5.8 billion as at the end of 2019,

out of which the microfinance loans and advances to

customers accounted for Rs. 4.7 billion, representing

81.7 per cent of the total assets. The Core Capital

level of the sector was Rs. 1.9 billion at end-2019

and all LMFCs were compliant with the minimum

prudential regulations on Core Capital and Liquidity

requirements. Despite a significant increase in the

operating expenses, the LMFC sector reported an

overall profit of Rs.0.1 billion after taxation as at

end-2019.

Unit Trusts

The number of Unit Trusts (UTs) declined to 71

by end-2019, from 75 reported at end-December

2018, whereas the number of UT management

companies remained at 14 in 2019. The 71 UTs

comprise 17 Money Market Funds, 13 Gilt Edged

Supervisory and Regulatory Developments

The regulatory and supervisory function of

the insurance sector was further strengthened

in the year 2019 by the IRCSL issuing directions

and circulars. A circular was issued to long-term

insurance companies to address the matter of

issuing stand-alone health insurance policies

and the Direction “Supply of Policy Documents

to Life Assured/Beneficiary” was amended

as certain life assureds/beneficiaries had not

been given a copy of the policy document in

the instances where the life assured was not a

policyholder. Further, a direction was issued by

the IRCSL to insurance brokers on compliance

with the minimum net capital requirement.

Superannuation Funds

The total assets of the superannuation

funds were reported to be Rs. 3,096.5 billion at

end-2019 reporting 15.4 per cent of the financial

sector assets. The sector was dominated by the

EPF, which accounted for 82.0 per cent of its

assets in 2019. In addition to the EPF, there were

two other publicly managed funds, namely, the

ETF and the state sector Public Service Provident

Fund (PSPF).

Employees’ Provident Fund

As per the Employees’ Provident Fund Act. No.

15 of 1958, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank

of Sri Lanka is entrusted with the custodianship

of the Fund while the Commissioner of Labour is

entrusted with the general administration of the

Fund.

(a) Membership, Member Balances

and Refunds: The total value of the Fund

increased by Rs. 251.1 billion to Rs. 2,540.4

billion at end-2019 from Rs. 2,289.4 billion

recorded by end-2018 recording an 11.0

per cent growth. This increase was due to the

combined effect of the net contributions of the

members (contributions less refund payments)

and the income generated through investments

of the Fund. Total liability to the members stood

at Rs. 2,497.6 billion at end-2019 recording a

10.8 per cent increase from Rs. 2,254.2 billion

at end-2018. The total contribution for the year

2019 increased by 8.4 percent to Rs. 157.2

billion while the total amount of refunds made to

the members and their legal heirs in 2019 was

Rs. 126.3 billion, which was an increase of

17.0 per cent over 2018. Accordingly, the net

contribution was Rs. 30.9 billion compared to

Rs. 37.0 billion recorded in the previous year.

The annual profit of the Fund increased by 16.9

per cent to Rs. 222.8 billion in 2019 from

Rs. 190.6 billion from the previous year. This was

mainly due to the increase in the interest income

of Rs. 25.2 billion compared to 2018 and the

reduction of marked to market losses from listed

equity investments from Rs. 10.9 billion in 2018

to Rs. 1.9 billion in 2019.

(b) Investment of Funds and Return: The

total investment portfolio (book value) of the

Fund grew by 10.9 per cent to Rs. 2,548.7

billion as at the end of 2019 from Rs. 2,298.8

billion at the end of 2018. The investment policy

of the Fund focused on providing a long-term

positive real rate of return to the members while

ensuring the safety of the Fund and availability

of the adequate level of liquidity to meet refund

payments and other expenses of the Fund.

Accordingly, at the end of 2019, the investment

portfolio consisted of 93.8 per cent in government

securities, 3.0 per cent in equity, 1.7 per cent

in corporate debentures and trust certificates,

0.9 per cent in fixed deposits and the remaining

0.6 per cent in Reverse Repurchase agreement.

The total investment income of the Fund

was Rs. 259.0 billion in 2019, and recorded

an increase of 16.5 per cent compared to

the previous year. Interest income including

amortisation gains continued to be the major source

of income to the Fund which grew by 11.0 per cent

to Rs. 254.7 billion in 2019 from Rs. 229.4 billion

in 2018. Dividend income also increased by 60.7

per cent to Rs. 6.2 billion in 2019 compared to

Rs. 3.9 billion in 2018. Net loss on Financial

Instruments (FIs) at Fair Value Through Profit or

Loss (FVTPL) recorded a loss of Rs. 1.9 billion in

2019 compared to net loss of Rs. 10.9 billion in

2018.

The Fund earned a total gross income of

Rs. 259.3 billion in 2019, recording an increase

of 16.4 per cent compared to the previous

year. After adjusting for operating expenditure and

tax expenditure, the net profit for the year 2019

was Rs. 228.8 billion which is an increase of 16.9

per cent compared to that of 2018. The EPF was

able to earn a 10.7 per cent Return on Average

Investment in 2019 while maintaining operating

expenses to a gross income ratio of 0.6 per cent

in 2019. With the introduction of the new Inland

Revenue Act, No.24 of 2017, which was effective

from 01 April 2018, the income tax rate applicable

for the Fund increased from 10 per cent to

14 per cent, which resulted in an increase of

Rs. 4.2 billion in the tax expenditure when

compared with the previous year. Furthermore,

the Withholding Tax (WHT) of 10.0 per cent paid

on Treasury bond interest income which had

been recognised as part of gross income under

the previous tax regulations has been abolished

with effect from 01 April 2018. Also, the adoption

of SLFRS 09, the Accounting Standard applicable

for classification and measurement of Financial

Instruments, where listed equity instruments are

measured at a fair value and under the prevailed

market conditions, a marked to market loss of

Rs. 1.9 billion was charged against the profit for

the year 2019. Accordingly, the EPF has taken

measures to declare an interest rate of 9.25 per

cent on member balances in 2019 after transferring

Rs. 7.7 billion to the Profit Equalisation Reserve.

the departmental risks to the Monetary Board

through the Board Risk Oversight Committee of

the Central Bank was continued throughout the

year.

Employees’ Trust Fund

The Employees’ Trust Fund that

contributed 11.1 per cent of the asset base

of the superannuation sector recorded an

improvement in its asset base, number of

members and the total contributions. Out of

15.3 million member accounts of the ETF, only

2.6 million accounts were active in 2019. The

number of employers contributing to the fund

slightly declined to 82,375 at end-December

2019 from 82,416 at end-December 2018.

Total member balance of the ETF increased

by 10.5 per cent to reach Rs. 338.6 billion at

end-December 2019 compared to Rs. 306.5

billion at end-December 2018. The total

contribution of the ETF increased by 8.7

per cent and reached Rs. 27.5 billion, while total

refunds increased by 8.3 per cent and reached

Rs. 19.8 billion which resulted in an increase of

9.7 per cent net inflow of funds during the year

2019.

Meanwhile, the total assets of the ETF

increased by 10.5 per cent and reached

Rs. 343.3 billion at end December 2019. The

ETF’s investment improved to Rs. 324.9 billion,

which is an increase of 11.6 per cent compared

to the year 2018. Out of these investments

76.9 per cent was invested in government

securities in 2019, a marginal increase from

the 75.2 per cent recorded in 2018. The share

of investments in fixed deposits has slightly

decreased to 17.2 per cent in 2019 compared

to 18.3 per cent in 2018. Further, the share of

investment in equity also declined to 3.3 per cent

in 2019 compared to the share of 3.7 per cent

reported in 2018. The fund managed to secure

a rate of return of 8.0 per cent on its member

Other Superannuation Funds

The Public Service Provident Fund,

which accounted for 2.1 per cent of the

superannuation sector, continued to

decrease in terms of the number of members

and net contributions, while reporting a

growth in terms of its assets. The number of

active members of the fund was 222,739 at end-

December 2019 when compared to 227,816 at

end-December 2018. The total assets of the PSPF

grew by 11.4 per cent and reached Rs. 63,674.8

million at end-December 2019. Meanwhile,

the investments of the fund also grew by 12.6

per cent reaching Rs. 62,315.4 million in

December 2019. The net contribution was

positive: Rs. 491.3 million during the year

2019 when compared to the net contribution of

Rs. 381.2 million reported in the year 2018. PSPF

invested 35.5 per cent in government securities

as a percentage of its total investments in 2019.

8.4 Performance of Financial

Markets

Domestic Money Market

Market Liquidity

Liquidity in the domestic money market,

which was in deficit levels until mid-April

2019, turned into a surplus level except for a

brief period in August and September 2019.

The downward revision of the SRR by 100 basis

points to 5.00 per cent with effect from 01 March

2019 was instrumental in easing the pressure on

liquidity conditions in the domestic money market.

Nevertheless, the liquidity deficit continued

to persist until mid-April 2019 largely due to

currency withdrawals during the festive season

and foreign loan repayments of the government.

Subsequently, market liquidity deficit turned into

a surplus level from mid-April 2019 as a result of

the conversion of ISB proceeds supported by the

foreign currency purchases by the Central Bank

as well as currency deposits after the festive

season. Although the money market reported

surplus liquidity on an aggregate basis, liquidity

was mainly concentrated among certain LCBs,

particularly foreign banks. Considering such an

asymmetric distribution of liquidity in the domestic

money market and resulting pressure on short

term interest rates, the Central Bank conducted

reverse repurchase auctions with a view to induce

a downward adjustment in the Average Weighted

Call Money Rate (AWCMR) in spite of the

surplus liquidity position in the domestic money

market. With the maturing of foreign currency

swap transactions and Treasury bills held by the

Central Bank, liquidity in the domestic money

market turned into a deficit by end-August 2019.

Considering the anticipated movements in liquidity

conditions in the domestic money market during

the ensuing period and considering lower demand

for Treasury bills at the outright auctions due to

unavailability of required securities with the market

participants, by expanding the eligible instruments

for OMOs, the Central Bank introduced outright

purchase of Treasury bonds since mid-September

2019 to inject liquidity into the domestic money

market on a permanent basis. By end-December

2019, the Central Bank had injected around Rs.

47.7 billion to the domestic money market by

way of purchasing Treasury bonds at the outright

auctions. Meanwhile, in view of providing liquidity

assistance for Standalone Primary Dealers

(SPDs), a Liquidity Support Facility (LSF) was

introduced in September 2019 to ensure smooth

functioning of the domestic money market. LSF

also facilitated the effective signalling of OMOs and

the maneuverability of the AWCMR to the desired

levels. Under LSF, the Central Bank provided

about Rs. 22.6 billion by end-December 2019 to

support overnight funding needs of SPDs. The

Central Bank continued to ensure the availability

of adequate liquidity in the domestic money market

with the objective of steering the AWCMR around

the middle rate of the Standing Rate Corridor

(SRC). In addition to newly introduced measures,

the Central Bank actively engaged in OMOs on a

daily and term basis to infuse liquidity and absorb

liquidity depending on market developments.

Accordingly, market liquidity stood at a surplus of

around Rs. 37.8 billion by end-December 2019.

Money Market Interest Rate

The AWCMR which remained closer to the

upper bound of the SRC during the first three

months of 2019, responded swiftly to monetary

policy relaxing measures, while active OMOs

helped in steering the AWCMR around the

middle of the SRC. During the latter part of 2018

and early 2019, the AWCMR was maintained

closer to the upper bound of the SRC in view of

external sector concerns. With the improvements

of the external sector environment, the AWCMR

was allowed to move towards the middle of the

SRC supported by the availability of adequate

liquidity in the domestic money market. Following

the policy rate reductions by a total of 100 basis

points during the months of May and August 2019,

the AWCMR declined even below the middle

point of the SRC. Accordingly, appropriate OMOs

were conducted to steer the AWCMR towards

the desired level. The Average Weighted Repo

Rate (AWRR) also followed a similar trend to the

AWCMR. By end-December 2019, the AWCMR

and the AWRR stood at 7.45 per cent and 7.53

per cent, respectively.

Other Developments

The Central Bank expanded its monetary

policy instruments under OMO in 2019.

Introduction of the LSF and outright auctions of

Treasury bonds in conjunction with the existing

OMOs which operated largely through repurchase

and reverse repurchase auctions added more

stimulus to the liquidity management mechanism

of the Central Bank. The LSF helped to improve

the signalling effect of OMOs and the outright

auctions of Treasury bonds facilitated resolving the

structural liquidity concerns which prevailed in the

domestic money market.

Although monetary policy implementation

encountered certain issues in 2019, the Central

Bank was able to effectively manage market

liquidity and ensure stability in short-term

money market rates. Asymmetric distribution

of liquidity amongst market participants and

the counterparty limits applicable for LCBs led

some participants to continuously borrow from

the Central Bank and induce some pressure on

the repo market. However, depending on market

developments, the Central Bank conducted OMOs

appropriately to ease any possible pressure on

interest rates. These measures yielded reduction

of the volatility of short-term money market interest

rates. Furthermore, with the introduction of the

LSF, the gap between AWCMR and AWRR was

reduced positively.

Domestic Foreign Exchange Market

During the year the Sri Lankan rupee

appreciated marginally against the US dollar by

0.61 per cent from Rs. 182.75 as at end-December

2018 to Rs. 181.63 as at end-December 2019. With

the positive impact of the policy measures taken by

the Central Bank and the government in late 2018

to mitigate the sharp depreciation pressure exerted

on the exchange rate in 2018, the Sri Lankan

rupee continued to show an appreciating trend

throughout 2019. This was further supported by

the easing of external pressure and the increase

in conversion of export proceeds in 2019. Despite

the slight increase in the pressure on the exchange

rate following the Easter Sunday attacks and the

decline in inflows on account of tourism observed

in the aftermath of the attacks, the receipts of the

delayed sixth tranche of the EFF from the IMF

in May 2019, and the ISB issuance in June

2019 supported to uphold the value of the Sri

Lankan rupee against US dollar. Accordingly, the

Sri Lankan Rupee appreciated at a higher pace

during the first half of 2019.

Although this overall appreciating trend

slowed down during the month of August mainly

due to the repatriation of foreign investments

from the government securities market, following

the presidential election in November 2019, the

exchange rate appreciated again at a moderate

pace. However, during the month of December,

with the repatriation of foreign investments from

the government securities market, the exchange

rate depreciated. Accordingly, during the year

2019 the Sri Lankan rupee appreciated by 0.61 per

cent against the US dollar. Further, in line with the

overall appreciation of Sri Lankan rupee against the

US dollar, the average US dollar buying and selling

exchange rate of LCBs for telegraphic transfers as of

end-2019 were at Rs. 179.66 and Rs. 183.33, whilst

comparative figures for end-2018 were Rs. 180.72

and Rs. 184.70, respectively.

Meanwhile, during the year the Sri Lankan

rupee appreciated against the Indian rupee,

Australian dollar and Euro, whereas it depreciated

against Japanese yen and Sterling pound.

Interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India

and Reserve Bank of Australia led the Sri Lankan

rupee to appreciate against the Indian rupee and

Australian dollar. Further, political uncertainties in

the Euro Zone resulted in the Sri Lankan rupee

appreciating against the Euro during the year.

Increase in safe haven demand for the Japanese

yen due to geo-political uncertainty and potential

expectation of Brexit after the new Prime Minister’s

appointment in Great Britain led to the depreciation

of the Sri Lankan rupee against the Japanese yen

and Sterling pound during the year 2019.

The Central Bank was a net buyer in the

domestic foreign exchange market during the

year 2019. Continuous purchases of US dollars

from the market despite moderate sales during

periods of excessive volatility in the exchange

rate, enabled the Central Bank to build up the

foreign reserves of the country. Accordingly,

during 2019 the Central Bank absorbed

US dollars 593.9 million and supplied US dollars

206.9 million resulting in a net purchase of

US dollars 387.0 million.

During the year 2019, trading volumes in

the domestic foreign exchange inter-bank

market increased by 11.3 per cent compared

to that of 2018. The total volume of inter-bank

foreign exchange transactions amounted to

US dollars 19.4 billion during this period

compared to US dollars 17.4 billion in the

corresponding period of 2018. In line with this,

the daily average volumes in the inter-bank

foreign exchange market increased to US dollars

80 million in 2019, from US dollars 73 million in

2018. Further, even though the total volume of

forward transactions for the year 2019 increased

to US dollars 7.7 billion compared to US dollar

6.6 billion during the period in 2018, the spot

transaction volumes remained unchanged at

60 per cent of the total annual volume in 2019

as well, reflecting the developed nature of the

domestic foreign exchange market.

Government Securities Market

The Treasury bill yield rates adjusted

downwards towards the end of the first quarter

of 2019 from the higher levels that prevailed at

end-2018. The strategic issuance arrangements

with predictable issuance calendar, improvement

of money market liquidity due to reduction of the

SRR applicable on LCBs, by 100 basis points

to 5.00 per cent in March 2019 and the positive

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

market sentiments that emanated from the

issuance of ISB to the value of US dollars 2.4

billion in March 2019 were the main contributory

factors for the downward adjustment of yield rates

in the short-term government securities market

during the first quarter of 2019. The excess funds

of the banking sector due to low demand for loans

and advances, and the move towards risk-free

investments such as Treasury bills also contributed

towards the downward adjustment of the yield curve.

Continuation of the accommodative monetary policy

stance of the Central Bank where Standing Deposit

and Lending Facility Rates were also adjusted

downwards in May and August 2019, issuance of

benchmark maturities in line with market preference

and resource availability coupled with the second

successful accessing of international capital markets

for 2019 by the government in June 2019 for US

dollars 2.0 billion, further eased the pressure in the

domestic market and as a result a gradual decline

in short-term interest rates of government securities

was observed during the second and third quarter

of 2019. The downward adjustment continued in the

fourth quarter as well, albeit at a slower pace until the

rates started to move upwards post the credit rating

downgrade by the rating agencies towards end-2019

and early 2020. Withdrawal of foreign investments

from emerging market economies including Sri

Lanka mainly due to continuing growth and positive

economic outlook in the United States resulted

in reduced foreign holdings of Treasury bills and

Treasury bonds by end-2019 compared to end-2018.

The debt management strategies adopted

during the year focused mainly on maintaining

a stable outlook in the government securities

market. Accordingly, the benchmark 364-day

Treasury bill yield rate which was above 10.00 per cent

levels since October 2018 declined to below 10.00

per cent levels in early January 2019 and recorded

a decline of 275 basis points by end-2019 compared

to end-2018. Further, the yield rates for 91-day, 182-

day and 364-day maturity Treasury bills stood at 7.51

per cent, 8.02 per cent and 8.45 per cent, respectively,

as at end-December 2019. Moreover, the downward

adjustment in short-term interest rates was also

reflected in medium term Treasury bond yield rates

during the second half of 2019.

Total net outflow of foreign investments in

Treasury bonds and Treasury bills amounted

to US dollars 333.7 million which consisted of

net inflow of US dollars 54.5 million in Treasury

bills and net outflow of US dollars 388.2 million

in Treasury bonds during the year 2019. The

outstanding foreign holdings of Treasury bonds and

Treasury bills as at end-2019 amounted to Rs. 103.9

billion compared to Rs. 158.6 billion as at end-2018,

recording a noteworthy decrease of 34.5 per cent on

a year-on-year basis.

In order to convert a part of the government

floating rate securities to fixed rate securities and

lengthen the maturity profile, the Central Bank

only raised US dollars 345.2 million against the

maturing amount of US dollars 621.8 million

of Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs)

during 2019 and funds raised through the

ISBs were utilised to pay back the remaining

maturities of SLDBs which eased the pressure

on government financing requirement and

stabilised the interest rates in the domestic

market. During 2019, the Average Time to Maturity

(ATM) of the outstanding central government

domestic currency debt decreased to 5.78 years

by end-2019 compared to 5.91 years at end-2018

primarily due to higher levels of yield structure

which prevailed in the early part of 2019 and higher

volumes of fund requirement. The ATM of the

outstanding Treasury bond portfolio decreased to

6.82 years at end-2019 compared to 6.88 years at

end-2018. The marginal downward adjustment of

the ATM is mainly attributed to issuance of short to

medium term maturities of Treasury bonds during

2019.

Corporate Debt Securities Market

The Commercial Paper (CP) market was

relatively active in 2019 compared to 2018.

During 2019, Rs. 4.2 billion was raised through

fifteen CP issuances with the support of licensed

banks compared to Rs. 1.9 billion raised through

six issues in 2018. Interest rates of CPs varied in

the range from 13.00 to 16.25 per cent during the

year compared to a range of 13.10 to 15.00 per

cent reported in the previous year. Out of the total

amount raised through CPs during the year 2019,

79.7 per cent was raised through CPs with maturities

less than three months while the remaining

20.3 per cent was raised through CPs with maturity

of twelve months. The total outstanding value

of CPs amounted to Rs. 2.1 billion at end-2019

compared to Rs. 1.1 billion at end-2018.

Level of activity in the corporate bond

(debenture) market improved during 2019

compared to 2018. During 2019, there were

thirty corporate debenture IPOs by 15 companies

in the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) which

raised Rs. 57.9 billion compared to Rs. 55.9 billion

raised in 2018. Out of the fifteen companies which

listed their corporate debentures in the CSE,

ten institutions were banks and other financial

institutions. Debentures with both fixed and floating

interest rates were issued during 2019 while the

fixed interest rates were in the range from 12.30

to 15.50 per cent compared to the range of 12.00

– 14.75 in the previous year. The two-highest listed

corporate debt issuances recorded in 2019 were

by DFCC Bank and Hatton National Bank which

raised Rs. 10.0 billion each.

Equity Market

The CSE recorded mixed performance

during 2019 amidst adverse developments

in the domestic and global environment. The

ASPI grew by 1.3 per cent in 2019 against the

5.0 per cent decline reported in 2018 while S&P

SL20 index declined by 6.3 per cent in 2019

compared to the 14.6 per cent decline reported in

2018. ASPI declined by 3.6 per cent immediately

after the Easters Sunday attacks and reached

5,200 in May 2019, its lowest value reported since

2012 and picked up gradually. The CSE indicators

picked during the month of November 2019 mainly

due to the positive sentiments that prevailed among

investors towards the presidential election.

Market recorded improvements in terms of

market capitalisation and Price to Earnings

Ratio (PER) in 2019. Market capitalisation

increased marginally by 0.4 per cent from

Rs. 2,839.5 billion in 2018 to Rs. 2,851.3

billion at end-2019. As a percentage of GDP,

total market capitalisation reached 21.5 per

cent at end-2019, a marginal increase from

21.4 per cent reported in 2018, which remained

low compared to peers in the Asian region.

However, the average daily turnover declined

to Rs. 711.2 million during 2019 compared to

Rs. 833.6 million in 2018. The turnover velocity

(the ratio of total turnover to average market

capitalisation) further deteriorated to 6.4 per

cent in 2019 from 6.9 per cent in 2018. Market

PER increased to 10.8 times at end-2019 from

9.7 times reported at end-December 2018.

The ratio reported its lowest value which was

8.1 per cent in May 2019 and highest value of

11.0 per cent in December 2019.

Foreign outflows from CSE continued

during 2019, though some improvements

were observed in terms of net foreign outflows

when compared to 2018. In the secondary

market, CSE reported a net foreign outflow of

Rs. 11.7 billion during the year 2019 compared

to Rs. 23.2 billion in the year 2018. The outflows

from the secondary market reported during 2019

are mainly due to security concerns caused by

Easter Sunday attacks and prevailed political

instability which affected investor confidence.

Meanwhile, the foreign investor contribution to

total market turnover significantly declined to

36.4 per cent in 2019 from 44.3 per cent in 2018.

The primary market continued to remain

less active in 2019. There were no Initial

Public Offerings in 2019 compared to Rs. 2.0

billion raised through two IPOs during 2018.

Meanwhile, Rs. 31.0 billion was raised through

18 right issues in 2019 compared to Rs. 42.2

billion raised through 16 issues in 2018.

Most of the price indices of subsectors of

the equity market reported an improvement

in 2019 compared to the previous year. The

bank, finance & insurance, beverage, food &

tobacco, diversified holdings, hotels & travels

and telecommunication sectors were the five

major subsectors which altogether contributed to

82.6 per cent of the total market capitalisation by

December 2019. The banks, finance & insurance

sector index declined in both 2019 and 2018

year-on-year by 1.0 per cent and 0.8 per cent,

respectively. Index of the beverage, food & tobacco

sector which accounts for 20.8 per cent of the total

market capitalisation, declined by 8.9 per cent

year-on-year in 2019 compared to the 5.3 per cent

growth that was registered in the previous year.

Indices of the subsectors diversified holdings,

hotels & travels, and telecommunication improved

in 2019 when compared to the previous year. Even

though the hotels & travels sector index significantly

declined in April 2019 as a result of the adverse

shock created by Easter Sunday attacks, the index

picked up in the second half of 2019.

Impact of the recent downturn in

major stock markets was reflected in the

performance of the CSE. Price indices of the

CSE declined notably in early March 2020 in

line with the downturn in the Asian stock market

triggered by the COVID-19 outbreak. A net

market foreign outflow of US dollars 12.4 million

was recorded from CSE from 01 February 2020

to 20 March 2020.

Several regulatory measures were taken by

the Securities and Exchange Commission to

ensure the smooth functioning of the equity

market. SEC introduced a revised qualification

framework to ensure a minimum level of competency

for investment advisors in the stock broking

industry. Further, the business and operational

specification of the Delivery vs. Payment and

enhanced margining model were finalised, and the

CSE is instructed to commence the implementation

process. The duality of Chief Executive Officer and

Chairperson of listed companies was imposed by

amending the Corporate Governance Framework.

Furthermore, SEC formulated the BASEL III

approval framework for state-owned banks’ listing

of contingent convertibles.

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

8.5 Development Finance and

Access to Finance

The Central Bank continued to engage in

development finance and regional development

activities by implementing various credit

schemes and other programs, in fulfilling the

agency function on behalf of the Government

of Sri Lanka (GOSL) in 2019. Individuals and

the Micro, Small and Medium Scale Enterprises

(MSMEs) of the country have benefitted from these

programmes through numerous refinance, interest

subsidy and credit guarantee schemes, and credit

supplementary services offered during the year by

the Central Bank.

With the objective of enhancing income

generating activities of the people in the rural

areas of the country to achieve balanced

economic growth, the Central Bank implemented

11 refinance, interest subsidy and credit

guarantee schemes through the Regional

Development Department (RDD). These schemes

provided concessionary credit facilities amounting

to Rs. 15,320 million through Participating Financial

Institutions (PFIs) to 104,238 beneficiaries

island wide. Out of this total disbursed amount,

68 per cent was for the interest subsidy schemes

while the remaining balance of 32 per cent went to

refinance for different loan schemes implemented

by the Central Bank during the year 2019. When

considering the total number of loans granted

to beneficiaries, 83 per cent accounted for

interest subsidy schemes and the balance part of

17 per cent accounted for refinance loan schemes.

The funding sources of these schemes were mainly

the Central Bank, the GOSL and international donor

agencies such as International Fund for Agriculture

Development (IFAD) and own funds of PFIs.

The GOSL continued the “Enterprise Sri

Lanka” (ESL) Programme in 2019 to improve

the development finance and access to finance

in the country by providing concessionary

financial and non-financial assistance to youth,

women and the micro, small and medium scale

entrepreneurs operating in the agriculture,

industry and services sectors in the country.

The total number of loans granted under the ESL

programme increased significantly to 44,841

in 2019 from 34,476 loans in 2018, and the

value of loans granted increased to Rs. 84,882

million in 2019 from Rs. 65,364 million in 2018.

Out of the total value of loans provided in 2019,

70.0 per cent (54.0 per cent of the total number of

loans) was disbursed in 8 districts (i.e., Gampaha,

Colombo, Kalutara, Galle, Matara, Hambantota,

Kandy and Kurunegala) whilst the balance

30.0 per cent (46.0 per cent of the total no. of

loans) was granted in 17 districts, which indicates

the need of lending to the lagging districts under

the programme. The GOSL paid approximately

Rs. 2,525 million as the interest subsidy payments

for the above loans in 2019. Further, the Ministry of

Finance continued the ADB funded Rooftop Solar

Power Generation Line of Credit (RSPGLoC) and

Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Line of Credit

Project (SMELoC) during the year. Accordingly, in

2019, RSPGLoC loan scheme granted 1,162 loans

amounting to Rs. 1,967 million to households and

entrepreneurs while SMELoC loan scheme granted

971 loans amounting to Rs. 7,323 million to SME

entrepreneurs.

An important new interest subsidiary

scheme namely ‘Smallholder Tea and Rubber

Revitalisation (STaRR)’ was implemented in

2019 to provide concessionary loans to the

smallholder farmers involved in tea replanting

and rubber new planting activities in the country.

The STaRR Project is jointly funded by the GOSL

and the IFAD with the collaboration of the Ministry

of Plantation Industries and Export Agriculture

(MPI&EA). This “STaRR Interest Subsidy

Scheme”, introduced under the “Inclusive Rural

the NFIS project and was further scrutinised to

identify the existing strengths and weaknesses

of the general landscape for improving financial

inclusion level of the country.

In the latter part of 2019, groundwork for the

establishment of a new Credit Guarantee Scheme

(CG Scheme) to accelerate already affected

businesses which need to fulfill the working

capital requirements especially for defaulted

SMEs was initiated by the Central Bank. The

proposed CG Scheme is expected to act as a risk

sharing tool to develop the SME sector by increasing

access to finance by absorbing part of the credit

risk of the PFIs and encouraging their lending to the

SMEs. The Central Bank also conducted various

programmes on entrepreneurship development

and skill development, specially covering the young

and women entrepreneurs in the country.

8.6 Financial Infrastructure

Payment and Settlement Systems

The Central Bank continued to maintain an

effective payment and settlement infrastructure

in the country in order to cater to the payment

needs of the individuals and institutions and to

successfully facilitate the economic activities

of the country through a well-functioning

national payment and settlement system.

Accordingly, the Central Bank, as the regulator of

the national payment system, efficiently conducted

its regulatory and supervisory activities to ensure

the smooth functioning of the financial system by

effectively mitigating the risks associated with the

national payment and settlement system.

LankaSettle System comprises of the Real

Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System and the

LankaSecure System which is the scripless

government securities settlement system.

During the year under review, the country’s only

large-value electronic payment system, which

Finance Component” of the STaRR Project, has

a project duration of 2 years from 2019 to 2021.

The Central Bank was identified as the agency for

implementing the scheme. As a supplementary

task for refinancing activities continued by the

PFIs, interest subsidy payment to such PFIs will

be released through the Central Bank starting from

2020 until 2024. The granting of the concessionary

loans under this scheme is expected to be started

in 2020.

Further, Smallholder Agribusiness

Partnerships Programme (SAPP) which

commenced its lending activities in the fourth

quarter of 2018, continued to perform well during

2019. The SAPP programme is jointly funded

by the IFAD and the GOSL. Considering the

feedback at the initial phase of the scheme, the

credit component of the SAPP was restructured

to enhance the operational efficiency and develop

better delivery channels for the beneficiaries in the

country. Further, Operating Instructions for 5 new

loan schemes were issued during the year 2019

to enhance different types of income generating

activities of the community in the country. The

loan scheme of SAPP includes two parts. One

part is related to the Public-Private-Producer-

Partnership (4P) model i.e. 4P Agribusiness and

RF Agribusiness loan scheme 4P. The other part

is related to individual models on value chain

financing Youth Loan Schemes and RF Youth &

RF Income Generation Loan Schemes.

Initiatives were taken to improve the financial

inclusion in the country. The National Financial

Inclusion Strategy (NFIS), developed by the Central

Bank, with the technical and financial assistance

obtained from the International Finance Corporation

(IFC) of the World Bank Group, is a strategic policy

initiative to identify and promote a more effective

and efficient process to improve financial inclusion

of the country. A Financial Inclusion Survey was

conducted island-wide successfully in 2018 under

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

is the RTGS System, functioned effectively and

efficiently. In 2019, RTGS System settled 428,161

transactions, registering an increase of 5.6 per cent

when compared with the previous year. In value

terms, the share of RTGS transactions in total

non-cash payments accounted for 87.5 per cent

in 2019. The Central Bank continued to provide

the interest free Intra-day Liquidity Facility (ILF)

against the collateral of government securities to

the participating institutions to minimise the liquidity

risk of the RTGS System. Accordingly, during the

year, participants of the RTGS System utilised an

average value of Rs. 63 billion per business day. At

end-2019, total value of scripless securities held in

LankaSecure amounted to Rs. 5,584.2 billion (Face

Value) consisting of Treasury bills of Rs. 897.7 billion

and Treasury bonds of Rs. 4,686.5 billion.

During the year under review, LankaClear

(Pvt.) Ltd (LCPL), which operates the Cheque

Clearing System of the country, functioned

smoothly. LCPL cleared a total volume of

46.8 million cheques amounting to Rs. 9,863

billion which accounted for 7.4 per cent of the total

value of non-cash payments of the country. When

compared with 2018, the total volume of cheques

cleared through the Cheque Clearing System

recorded a negative growth of 7.1 per cent and the

total value declined by 6.3 per cent in 2019.

The Sri Lanka Interbank Payment System

(SLIPS) which mainly facilitates low-value retail

bulk payments such as salaries and pensions

continued to operate efficiently during 2019.

The operations of SLIPS recorded a growth in

terms of both volume and value of payments by

11.1 per cent to 36.6 million and 6.7 per cent to

Rs. 2,104 billion, respectively.

In 2019, the Common Card and Payment

Switch (CCAPS) which operates under the

brand name ‘LankaPay’ recorded a significant

progress and launched the Common Point of

Sale Switch (CPS). Further, the other three

switches launched so far, namely the Common

ATM Switch (CAS), Common Electronic

Fund Transfer Switch (CEFTS) and Shared

ATM Switch (SAS) increased its transaction

volumes over the previous year. CAS, which

connects ATMs of member financial institutions,

enables customers of such financial institutions to

perform cash withdrawals and balance inquiries

from any ATM connected to the CAS network. In

2019, the transaction volume and value of CAS

increased by 17.2 per cent to 47.4 million and

23.4 per cent to Rs. 425.2 billion respectively, in

comparison to the previous year. As at the end

of 2019, 30 financial institutions were integrated

to the CAS network. SAS, which was launched

in 2015 to provide card management and ATM

transaction routing services to financial institutions

which do not have the capacity to operate their own

card management system, had two members and

continued its operations smoothly during the period

under review.

CEFTS, which provides a common

infrastructure for switching and clearing

facilities to real time retail fund transfers,

among member institutions, carried out

through multiple payment channels such

as ATM, Internet Banking, Mobile Banking,

Kiosks and over the counter. In comparison to

the previous year, a significant progress in CEFTS

transactions were observed during 2019. The

CEFTS transaction volume increased by 104.6 per

cent to 14.8 million, while the CEFTS transaction

value grew by 109.4 per cent to Rs. 1,382.8 billion

in 2019. In order to facilitate online payments

to governmental institutions, LankaPay Online

Payment Platform (LPOPP) was launched in

2017. LPOPP currently facilitates online real time

payments to Sri Lanka Customs. As at the end of

2019, 13 LCBs and one LSB have joined LPOPP.

During the year under review, 37,238 transactions

FINANCIAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM STABILITY

307

8

with an aggregate value of Rs. 34.3 billion were

processed through LPOPP. In addition, for CAS and

CEFTS, there are four clearing cycles per business

day in order to enable faster clearing and settlement

of CAS and CEFTS transactions. The Central Bank

has imposed the Minimum Liability Manager Limits

in CAS and CEFTS for primary participants in order

to ensure smooth operation of these switches.

The National Card Scheme (NCS), operated

by LCPL in partnership with Japan Credit

Bureau International of Japan was launched

with a view to promote card payments and

thereby enable financial inclusion by reducing

costs incurred by cardholders and merchants

on domestic payment card transactions. During

2019, several financial institutions started issuing

payment cards under NCS. In addition, 4 licensed

financial acquirers joined the CPS, which provides

switching and clearing facilities for payment cards

issued under NCS carried out at point of sale

terminals.

The Central Bank continued its regulatory

and supervisory activities with regard to

payment cards and mobile payment systems

in terms of the Payment Cards and Mobile

Payment Systems Regulations No. 1 of 2013

(The Regulation). Accordingly, three financial

institutions were licensed to function as issuers of

debit cards while another financial institution was

granted a licence to function as a financial acquirer of

payment cards, in terms of the Regulation. Further,

on-site and off-site supervisions were carried out to

ensure compliance with the Regulation by Service

Providers of Payment Cards and Mobile Payment

Systems.

The Central Bank, as the regulator of

payment and settlement systems of the

country, continued its supervisory function and

further strengthened the regulatory framework

in order to minimise the risks associated with

the national payment and settlement system.

Considering the risks involved in using electronic

payment modes, the Central Bank issued a Circular

to all financial institutions facilitating electronic

payment instruments, regarding providing real

time notifications by the financial institutions to

customers who use electronic payment modes.

Accordingly, financial institutions were informed to

use an appropriate communication method to notify

customers when providing payment services through

electronic payment instruments/mechanisms.

Further, during the year 2019, the Central Bank

monitored the compliance of financial institutions to

the Guideline on the minimum compliance standard

for payment related mobile applications, which

was issued to set minimum security standards to

minimise the risks of using mobile applications to

perform financial transactions.

The National Payments Council (NPC),

the industry consultative and monitoring

committee on payment and settlement systems,

appointed several committees on FinTech

developments to focus on new innovations

such as Digital Payment Platform, Open

Application Programming Interface (API) and

Virtual Banking, and to popularise the mass use

of digital payments by raising awareness among

the general public. Focusing on the transition

towards a “less cash society”, the NPC finalised the

Road Map for 2020-2022, covering areas of facilitating

innovative payment products, promoting e-payments,

enhancing standardisation and interoperability among

payment mechanisms, strengthening payment

system security and implementing measures to

increase public awareness on payment systems.

The National QR Code Specification branded

as “LankaQR” was issued to promote customer

convenience and safety through no transaction

cost, instant payment notification etc., while

encouraging more merchants to join as

acquirers due to zero maintenance cost, low set

up and transaction cost while “LankaQR” also

ensures interoperability of different payment

mechanisms and instruments. Several financial

institutions launched “LankaQR” based payment

products during the year under review.

The Central Bank established the “FinTech

Regulatory Sandbox”, which provides innovators

a safe space to test their products and services

without infringing the regulatory requirements.

The FinTech Regulatory Sandbox is expected to

create robust and sustainable innovations that can

provide more efficient financial intermediation, greater

financial inclusion, and create a less-cash society

through digitalisation.

Considering the new technological

developments in the payment industry, the

Central Bank appointed a Working Committee

on Blockchain Technology to assess the

possibility of applying Blockchain Technology

in the financial industry in Sri Lanka. As per the

recommendations of the Committee, the Central

Bank initiated to develop a Proof-of-Concept for the

Blockchain Technology based Shared Know-Your-

Customer (KYC) facility, which could facilitate to

streamline KYC processes in financial institutions. It

is expected that this would increase efficiencies in

the financial sector and thereby enhance financial

inclusion in Sri Lanka.

The Central Bank announced the year 2020

as the “Year of Digital Transactions”. This

initiative was made with the objective of improving

awareness on digital transactions among the public

including merchants and employees of financial

institutions by using newspaper advertisements,

interviews, press conferences and radio

broadcasting. Further, a Committee was appointed

to carry out campaign for the “Year of Digital

Transactions” throughout the country.

Further, the Central Bank increased the

maximum hold value of a wallet account

maintained in mobile phone based e-money

systems from Rs. 25,000.00 to Rs. 50,000.00

in wallet accounts that have fulfilled all KYC

requirements while limiting e-money accounts

to one per individual irrespective of the mobile

network used by the e-money account holder

to connect to the mobile phone based e-money

system, by issuing a Circular on Number of

e-Money Accounts, Individual Stored Value

Limits, Day Limits and Transaction Limits

Applicable for Customer e-Money Accounts.

Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism

The Financial Intelligence Unit of Sri Lanka

(FIU), in line with the international standards

to strengthen Anti-Money Laundering and

Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/

CFT) regime of the country, carried out its

functions vigorously in 2019 to preserve the

overall integrity and stability of the financial

system. The FIU in its principle role as the national

focal point to counter Money Laundering / Terrorism

Financing (ML/TF) risks, receives financial

information relating to suspicious transactions, on

any transaction or attempted transaction, which

may be related to the commission of unlawful

activity submitted by Reporting Institutions (RIs)

FINANCIAL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEM STABILITY

309

in terms of Section 7 of the Financial Transactions

Reporting Act, No. 6 of 2006 (FTRA). Suspicious

Transaction Reports (STRs) are analysed and the

results are disseminated to the Law Enforcement

Agencies (LEAs), regulators and other relevant

entities where necessary. The total number of

STRs received significantly increased to 2,806

during 2019 compared to 1,020 STRs received

during 2018. A total of 1,478 STRs were referred

by the FIU to the LEAs and regulatory authorities

after operational and strategic analyses, for further

investigations during 2019 compared to 338 STRs

referred during 2018. This significant increase in

STRs both received by FIU and referred by FIU

to LEAs can be largely attributed to the Easter

Sunday attacks. Awareness building and outreach

conducted by the FIU for its RIs during the year

may have also contributed to the significant

increase. As mandated, the RIs continue to report

Cash Transactions (CTRs) and Electronic Fund

Transfers (EFTs-inward and outwards) subject to

the specified reporting threshold of Rupees one

million or its equivalent in foreign currencies as

per the Section 6 of the FTRA. RIs have reported

4.9 million (provisional) CTRs and 6.6 million

(provisional) EFTs during the year 2019.

The FIU strengthened its multifaceted

strategy to enhance compliance of RIs by

regularly improving the legal, supervisory

and operational framework in line with the

international best practices on AML/CFT.

Further, the FIU strengthened ties with other

sector specific regulators through consolidated

and cooperative efforts. During 2019, 32 risk-

based on-site examinations were conducted to

assess financial institutions’ (i.e. LCBs, LSBs,

LFCs, Insurance Companies and Stock Brokers)

compliance with the provision of the FTRA,

Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Rules and other

regulations issued. During the year, the FIU carried

out 4 follow-up examinations, issued 32 warning

letters and 6 Show-Cause Letters to FIs. The FIU

imposed proportionate and dissuasive sanctions

amounting to Rs. 5 million against FIs that failed

to comply with the requirements stipulated in the

FTRA and CDD rules during the period under

consideration.

The FIU took measures to enhance the

compliance level of the designated non-finance

businesses and professions (DNFBPs), which

were recognised as a high risk sector for ML/

TF in the 2014 National Risk Assessment.

During 2019, 36 risk-based supervisions were

conducted to assess the level of compliance of

several DNFBP sectors: Casinos, Gem & Jewellery

and Real Estate sectors. The FIU issued letters to

22 institutions of the DNFBPs sector informing the

deficiencies identified and provided a time bound

action plan to rectify the identified deficiencies

during the year. With the aim of increasing outreach,

the FIU published several advertisements through

print media on AML/CFT compliance obligations

for DNFBPs throughout the year.

With a view of strengthening the AML/

CFT supervision process and institutional

compliance, the FIU issued several rules and

guidelines during the year 2019 on suspicious

transactions reporting, conducting ongoing

CDD based on a risk-based approach,

enhanced due diligence, identification of

beneficial ownership and identification of

Politically Exposed Persons. In 2019, the

FIU conducted 55 awareness programmes

for FIs, DNFBPs, government authorities and

other stakeholders on AML/CFT obligations,

identification of beneficial ownership information

and implementation of targeted financial sanctions.

The outreach exercises conducted by the FIU had

around 3,688 participants during 2019. In addition,

the FIU hosted a team of officials from Financial

Intelligence Unit of Maldives for a study visit during

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

3108

2-5 December 2019 for sharing experience on AML/

CFT risk based supervision, analysis of STR and

Sri Lankan experience on Mutual Evaluation. The

FIU successfully conducted the BIMSTEC SG-CFT

Workshop on “Experience in Countering Terrorism

and Terrorist Financing through Case Studies”

at Colombo during 27-29 November 2019 with

the participation of 40 delegates from BIMSTEC

member countries. The workshop provided an

opportunity to share Sri Lanka’s experience in

Countering Terrorism and Terrorist Financing with

other members of the BIMSTEC.

The FIU, in view of fostering strong

relationships and enhanced cooperation with

foreign agencies for information sharing and

cooperation, entered into two Memoranda

of Understanding (MoUs) with the Financial

Intelligence Unit of Maldives and Financial

Analysis and Supervision Unit of Papua New

Guinea during 2019, increasing the total

number of MoUs with foreign counterparties to

39. Further, with a view to exchange information,

three MoUs were signed with domestic agencies

i.e. the National Gem and Jewellery Authority,

the Condominium Management Authority and

INTERPOL National Central Bureau for Sri Lanka

during the year, thus increasing the total number of

MoUs signed with domestic agencies up to 11.

Since being listed in the FATF2 Compliance

Document (which identifies countries with

strategic AML/CFT deficiencies) “The Grey

List” in November 2017, the FIU and other

stakeholders took a number of effective

measures towards the successful completion

of the time-bound action plan provided to

Sri Lanka by the FATF to address several

strategic deficiencies identified in AML/CFT

activities. These measures included passing the

Trusts (Amendment) Act, No. 6 of 2018, the Mutual

2 FATF is an independent inter-governmental body that develops and promotes policies to protect the global financial system against money laundering, terrorist financing and the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

Assistance in Criminal Matters (Amendment) Act,

No. 24 of 2018, issuing regulations/directives/

guidelines on implementing United Nation’s

Security Council Resolutions on North Korea and

Iran, extending the AML/CFT coverage to DNFBPs

by issuing CDD Rules, conducting risk-based AML/

CFT supervision of the FIs and DNFBPs sector,

taking enforcement actions on non-compliances

observed and increasing awareness on AML/CFT.

The FATF assessed Sri Lanka’s progress in

terms of implementing the Action Plan through

the Asia Pacific Joint Group (AP/JG). In February

2019, FATF made the initial determination that Sri

Lanka had completed its action plan substantially.

Subsequently, an on-site assessment was

conducted by the AP/JG to verify implementation

of the FATF Action Plan, during 16-17 September

2019. The AP/JG representatives had face-to-face

meetings with all relevant stakeholders, including

the private sector and the Minister of Finance to

ascertain Sri Lanka’s political and institutional

commitment towards the implementation of the

AML/CFT framework in a suitable manner. The

recommendations made by the review team on

Sri Lanka’s progress were discussed at the FATF

Plenary held in October 2019 and all members

endorsed the decision to delist Sri Lanka from the

Grey List. Accordingly, on 18 October 2019 the

FATF announced that Sri Lanka is no longer subject

to the FATF monitoring process. The delisting by

the FATF is expected to have a positive economic

and financial impact on Sri Lanka.

Legal Reforms related to the Financial Sector

During the year 2019, the Central Bank

carried out many rigorous law reforms to the

legislations applicable thereto with the objective

of strengthening and enhancing the regulatory

and supervisory powers vested therein.

Accordingly, the Central Bank formulated the new

Introduction

Moneylending can be described as lending of money at an interest, with or without a security, by a moneylender to a borrower. In Sri Lanka, moneylending is mainly carried out by the Licensed Banks and other financial institutions such as the Licensed Finance Companies, Licensed Microfinance Companies, Microfinance Non-Governmental Organizations, Co-operative Rural Banks and Thrift and Credit Co-operative Societies, and Samurdhi Community-Based Banks. However, there are informal moneylenders as well, who operate throughout the country in the forms of individuals, sole proprietors, partnerships or companies.

Although the moneylending activities of licensed banks and other financial institutions are regulated, 1the informal moneylenders are not regulated or supervised by any regulatory authority in Sri Lanka. The existing legal framework is mainly focused on financial institutions, which are engaged in financial intermediation and important from the view point of financial system stability. Further, the Money Lending Ordinance, No. 2 of 1918 (the Money Lending Ordinance), which provides protection for customers of moneylenders coming under its purview, does not mandate a specific regulator nor a licensing/registration requirement for moneylenders. Thus, a customer, who intends to seek redress under the Money Lending Ordinance, needs to initiate legal procedure, which could involve considerable amount of financial and other resources.

In this background, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) identifies the need to establish a prudential regulatory framework in the informal moneylending business in the country. Such need was amply justified by the amount of evidence collected through the field visits by the CBSL, and complaints received in relation to various malpractices and customer harassment incidents by moneylenders.

Importance of Regulating the Informal Moneylending Business

a) Regulation of informal moneylenders is important from the view point of customer protection. As informal moneylenders are not subject to any customer protection regulations, customers of such moneylenders are often subjected to unfair terms and conditions, as well as harassment. Thus,

1 The Licensed Banks and Licensed Finance Companies and Licensed Microfinance Companies are regulated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka; the Non-Governmental Organizations engaged in microfinance business are regulated by the Registrar of Voluntary Social Services Organizations; Co-operative Rural Banks and Thrift and Credit Co-operative Societies are regulated by the Department of Co-Operative Development; and the Samurdhi Community Based Banks are regulated by the Department of Samurdhi Development.

BOX 13Requirement for Regulating the Informal Moneylending Business in Sri Lanka

the customers of informal moneylenders may lose trust and confidence, and eventually end up with no access to financial services .

b) At present, the informal moneylending businesses do not report information on their borrowers to the Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka (CRIB). Therefore, formal moneylending institutions tend to lack comprehensive information on their customers when assessing creditworthiness. Further, non existence of CRIB reporting by informal moneylenders encourages some borrowers, particularly with a default history, to access the unregulated moneylenders for their financial requirements. The absence of a proper assessment of creditworthiness by unregulated moneylenders results in granting multiple-loans to the same customer, leading to over-indebtedness,2 which could lead to various socio-economic costs such as disruption of education of children, increase in malnutrition, loss of livelihood etc.

c) Existence of a larger number of informal moneylenders in the country could sometimes lead to severe competition in the formal money lending businesses as well, resulting in unethical practices and harassment of customers.

d) Collecting information on the microfinance industry of Sri Lanka is a challenge when informal moneylenders are not required to report information to any formal authority.

e) Existence of a large number of unregulated money lending businesses could create issues in designing and implementing credit policies, particularly for small and medium scale enterprises.

Regional Experience on Regulating the Moneylending Business

Several countries in the region regulate the moneylending business, as indicated below.

(a) In Malaysia, moneylenders are required to obtain a licence under the Moneylenders Act 1951 (as amended). The Moneylenders Act provides for regulation of moneylending business, including protection of customers of moneylending businesses.

2 Over-indebtedness has been defined by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), as the inability to repay all debts fully and on time.https://www.cgap.org/blog/over-indebtedness-roles-and-responsibilities-all-actors

CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL REPORT 2019

3128

(b) In Bangladesh, microcredit institutions are required to obtain a license under the Microcredit Regulatory Authority Act, No.32 of 2006, to conduct micro credit programs, and are regulated by the Microcredit Regulatory Authority of Bangladesh.

(c) The Central Bank of Philippines regulates the business of extending credit by creditors in the customer protection perspective under the Truth in Lending Act, (Republic Act No. 3765).

(d) The Reserve Bank of India regulates systemically important, non-deposit taking, non-bank finance companies, under the Reserve Bank of India Act of 1934.

The Proposed Microfinance Credit Regulatory Authority Act (proposed Act)

With a view to addressing some of the issues highlighted above, the CBSL proposed the enactment of the proposed Act. The proposed Act which was approved by the Monetary Board of the CBSL enables the establishment of the Microfinance and Credit Regulatory Authority (the Authority), which is a statutory body to be set up within the Ministry of Finance (MOF). This Authority, which consists of ex-officio representatives from the MOF, the CBSL, and nominees of the Governor of CBSL and the Minister of Finance, is mandated to regulate the microfinance institutions and unregulated moneylenders.

The proposed Act further provides protection for customers of microfinance and moneylending business while necessitating the reporting requirement to the CRIB by the regulated institutions. The proposed Act would repeal and replace the Microfinance Act, No.6 of 2016 (Microfinance Act).

Concluding Remarks

The issues associated with the informal moneylenders such as the over-indebtedness of customers, lack of reporting of credit information to authorities, and lack of protection for customers etc., could lead to significant socio-economic costs, unless appropriate measures are initiated on a priority basis. In that context, the proposed Act is expected to address such issues identified in the informal and unregulated moneylending business in the country. The proposed Act could also assist in addressing some of the shortcomings identified in the existing Microfinance Act, where there could be a possibility of a regulatory arbitrage due to the existence of different regulators for Licensed Microfinance Companies and Microfinance Non-Governmental Organizations, and also more emphasis given to regulation of deposit taking microfinance institutions over micro-credit institutions, which could result in lack of protection for small time borrow.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Bill which intends to repeal

its Act of incorporation, the Monetary Law Act, No. 58

of 1949. With the assistance of various stakeholders

such as the Ministry of Finance, the Attorney General’s

Department and the Legal Draftsman’s Department,

the draft Bill was published in the Gazette in November

2019. In addition, amendments to the Foreign

Exchange Act, No. 12 of 2017, Registered Stocks

and Securities Ordinance, No. 07 of 1937, the Debt

Recovery (Special Provisions) Act, No. 2 of 1990 and

the Electronic Transactions Act, No. 19 of 2006 were

introduced. The Central Bank also assisted relevant

stakeholders, in various capacities, in the process of

drafting legislation such as the International Financial

Centre Bill, Data Protection Bill, Cyber Security Bill,

etc. to establish a comprehensive legal framework for

the financial sector in Sri Lanka.

Resolution and Enforcement Action on Weak Financial Institutions

Resolution and enforcement functions

were continued while managing Sri Lanka

Deposit Insurance and Liquidity Support

Scheme (SLDILSS). Payment of compensation

for the depositors of failed LFCs, namely Central

Investments and Finance PLC (CIFL) and The

Standard Credit Finance Limited (TSCFL) was

continued under the SLDILSS. Compensation to

3,024 depositors of CIFL and 2,309 depositors

of TSCFL which amounted to Rs. 1,271.4 million

and Rs. 947.3 million, respectively were paid

during 2019. All the arrangements were made

to commence compensation payments for the

depositors of TKS Finance Ltd. from January

2020. The Central Bank is in the process of

formulating a resolution framework for licensed

banks and LFCs with the assistance of the

expert advisors from the US Treasury, and

arrangements were made for the inclusion of

provisions on resolution procedures and deposit

insurance in drafting the new Banking Act.

Enforcement actions were continued with

the cooperation of the Attorney General’s

Department and law enforcement authorities

such as the Sri Lanka Police and Financial Crimes

Investigation Division. Upon receiving complaints

from the general public, a few investigations were

conducted on unauthorised finance businesses and

prohibited schemes under the relevant provisions

of the Finance Business Act and the Banking Act

respectively. Awareness programmes were also

conducted island-wide by the Central Bank with a

view to improve financial literacy and to educate on

the ill-effects of unauthorised finance businesses

and prohibited schemes.

Regulation and Supervision of Foreign Exchange

The Central Bank continued to monitor

foreign exchange transactions of the country.

The activities of the Restricted Dealers (RDs) who

have been authorised to engage in money changing

business were continuously monitored with a view

of developing the domestic foreign exchange market

further. During the year, RDs deposited US dollars

268.6 million to the banking system, recording

a decrease of 46.1 per cent compared to 2018.

Meanwhile, RDs have sold US dollars 21.6 million

in 2019, an increase of 47.1 per cent compared

to 2018. As a result, in 2019, gross purchases of

foreign currencies by RDs (sum of deposits of RDs

to the banking system and their sales of foreign

currency) decreased by 43.4 per cent to US dollars

290.2 million compared to the previous year.

The Central Bank initiated several measures

to facilitate foreign exchange transactions of the

country. During 2019, a number of amendments

were finalised to the existing Regulations, Orders and

Directions issued under the provisions of the Foreign

Exchange Act, No. 12 of 2017 (FEA). In addition,

amendments to the FEA also proposed to address

issues and concerns in respect of certain provisions

of the FEA with regard to implementing the Act,

including empowerment to combat unauthorised

foreign exchange transactions. Meanwhile, the

Central Bank facilitated the issuance of three

Regulations by the Minister of Finance under the

provisions of the FEA. Accordingly, these Gazette

Notifications were issued permitting the GOSL to

issue ISBs in 2019 and to make related payments

to non-resident investors, allowing GOSL and

State-Owned Enterprises of the GOSL to borrow

from outside Sri Lanka with the approval of the line

Ministry without such loan proceeds being routed

through lenders’ Inward Investment Accounts,

and extending the time period required for

exporters of goods to repatriate export proceeds

of such exportation since 17 October 2019.

Further, to align with other measures adopted by

the Central Bank a directive was issued in early

2019 to Authorised Dealers (ADs), removing the

restrictions imposed in the latter part of 2018, with

regard to the conversion of Sri Lanka rupees in to

foreign exchange for making payments for import

of certain non-essential consumer goods under the

advance payment terms. The Central Bank has

taken initiatives to implement a comprehensive

cross border and foreign currency transactions

monitoring system in order to collect data from ADs

as a mechanism to capture and monitor foreign

exchange transactions in terms of the Regulations

and Directions issued under FEA, while supporting

macroeconomic decision-making on important

policy areas by obtaining and analysing data

relevant to the foreign exchange transactions.

Credit Information

During 2019 the Credit Information Bureau

(CRIB) issued 10.1 million credit reports to the

industry recording a 2.0 per cent slight increase

compared to the previous year. The lending

institutions obtained 9.3 million consumer credit

reports and 0.8 million corporate credit reports in

2019.

Demand for the self-inquiry credit reports

(iReports) continued to increase further in 2019

recording a 7.2 per cent increase compared to

the year 2018. During 2019, 16,006 customers

visited the Bureau to obtain their iReports and

2,053 customers applied their iReports through

the banks. A total of 448 new individuals were

registered for the iReport online service during

the year and 1,375 users accessed their iReports

online in 2019. The CRIB currently receives

monthly updates of more than 12 million credit

facilities to be processed through its automated

Credit Information Management System (CRIMS).

In 2019, the CRIB initiated the implementation

of a new Credit Bureau System. This strategic

initiative encompasses the implementation of

state-of-the-art credit bureau solutions including a

new credit scoring system, a first of its kind in the

country, to bring changes to the overall Credit Risk

Management framework with the aim of developing

an agile financial infrastructure in Sri Lanka. The

CRIB expects to go-live with the new system by

late 2020.

As an interim solution until the new Credit

Bureau System comes online, the CRIB

launched its latest product, the “CRIB’s Credit

Score”, Sri Lanka’s first credit scoring system

which is branded as “CRIB Score” to the

industry in December 2019. The introduction of

credit score is expected to improve the country’s

position on the World Bank’s “Ease of Doing

Business Ranking” under the ‘Ease of Getting

Credit’ performance indicator. This ranking is

an important international benchmark sought by

various international investors when assessing any

country’s investment environment and its economic

competitiveness. The “CRIB Score” is a number

ranging from 250 to 900, which provides lending

institutions with a consistent indication of underlying

the credit risk levels, for objective assessment of credit

worthiness and probability of default of a particular

borrower. The CRIB Scores of all individuals were

made available to the lending institutions, initially.

The CRIB is also planning to release “CRIB Score –

Corporate” to the member lending institutions, during

2020. Subsequently, the public would also be able

to obtain their own credit scores, through the CRIB

or through the financial institution they wish to obtain

their service from.
