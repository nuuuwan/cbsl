prices offered at gig economy platforms are significantly 
lower 
than 
the  prices  elsewhere  and  might  not  be 
properly reflected in official price indices (Bean, 2016). 
This  will  lead  to  an  overestimation  of  price  indices.  In 
such  instances,  the  value  added  to  economic  activity, 
estimated 
in 
real 
terms  using  such  price  deflators, 
would  be  underestimated.  Moreover,  sharing  services 
in a gig economy pose challenges for the expenditure 
classification of national accounts, as well. For example, 
purchasing  a  car  for  personal  use  is  considered  as  a 
household  consumption  expenditure,  whereas  a  car 
purchased  for  renting  purposes  is  considered  as  an 
investment.  However,  when  a  car 
personal  use  but  is  utilised  for  an  income-generating 
activity such as ride-sharing, it is difficult to estimate in 
practice the respective proportions related to investment 
and consumption. This leads to an underestimation of 
investment expenditure (Bean, 2016).
Statisticians 
and 
policymakers 
experiment  for  better  sources  of  data  and  indicators 
that  capture  the  impact  and  contribution  of  the  gig 
economy  since 
traditional  sources  and  methods 
use  are  ill-equipped  to  accurately  estimate  economic 
activities  within  the  gig  economy.  In  addressing  this 
issue, advanced countries like Canada have succeeded 
in capturing gig income data to a certain extent using 
‘self-employees’ tax returns’ (Jeon et al., 2019). Further, 
a well-structured household survey that covers multiple 
employment 
income  might  also  be  able 
income  earned  through  gig  work  to  a  greater  extent. 
Moreover,  digital  platforms  that  facilitate  gig  workers 
could be a vital source of data, particularly when a few 
platforms dominate the market.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Only way to

in","","In  Sri  Lanka,  some  of 
the  gig  economy  activities, 
such  as  platform-based 
ride-sharing 
accommodation services have emerged in recent years. 
A  significant  number  of  persons  living  in  the  Western 
province and other urban and semi-urban areas already 
use  mobile  apps  to  hire  a  taxi  or  a  truck  instead  of 
waiting by the roadside. Further, the gig economy would 
gradually reach the rural community as well, where there 
could  be  a  significant  potential  to  use  gig  activity  in 
areas such as farm machinery sharing. Considering the 
importance of capturing gig activities in official statistics, 
authorities dealing with official statistics in Sri Lanka are 
currently working on alternative methods to estimate the 
gig  economy.  However,  the  unavailability  of  reliable 
data  remains  a  major  obstacle  in  understanding  the 
significance of the gig economy and its impact on the 
Sri Lankan economy. Although gig economic activity of 
developing countries like Sri Lanka would be significantly 
lower  than  that  of  developed  countries,  it  is  certainly 
worth  monitoring  the  gig  economy  as  it  is  one  of  the 
fastest-growing areas in this digitalised world.
