The extra income generated by improved utilisation of resources under the gig economy might not be fully accounted for in the official estimates. For example, renting a room of a house for a tourist or hiring a vehicle through digital platforms adds value to the economy, yet there is no proper source to quantify the value added from such activities. Further, using deflators in determining the real value added is a common practice in national income accounting.

This will lead to an overestimation of price indices. In such instances, the value added to economic activity, estimated in real terms using such price deflators, would be underestimated. Moreover, sharing services in a gig economy pose challenges for the expenditure classification of national accounts, as well. For example, purchasing a car for personal use is considered as a household consumption expenditure, whereas a car purchased for renting purposes is considered as an investment. However, when a car is purchased for personal use but is utilised for an income-generating activity such as ride-sharing, it is difficult to estimate in practice the respective proportions related to investment and consumption. This leads to an underestimation of investment expenditure (Bean, 2016).",

A significant number of persons living in the Western province and other urban and semi-urban areas already use mobile apps to hire a taxi or a truck instead of waiting by the roadside. Further, the gig economy would gradually reach the rural community as well, where there could be a significant potential to use gig activity in areas such as farm machinery sharing. Considering the importance of capturing gig activities in official statistics, authorities dealing with official statistics in Sri Lanka are currently working on alternative methods to estimate the gig economy. However, the unavailability of reliable data remains a major obstacle in understanding the significance of the gig economy and its impact on the Sri Lankan economy. Although gig economic activity of developing countries like Sri Lanka would be significantly lower than that of developed countries, it is certainly worth monitoring the gig economy as it is one of the fastest-growing areas in this digitalised world.",
