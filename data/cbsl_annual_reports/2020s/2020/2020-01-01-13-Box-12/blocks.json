The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), as the statutory manager of government debt, is tasked with the issuance and management of Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds on behalf of the government, in terms of the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance No. 8 of 1923 (LTBO) and the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance No. 7 of 1937 (RSSO), respectively.",

The difference between the selling price of the security and the buyback price of the security is the interest cost for borrowing funds. A reverse repurchase transaction, on the other hand, is a lending transaction collateralised by a Treasury Bill or a Treasury Bond, i.e., the inverse of a repurchase transaction.",

These Directions were intended to standardise the basic parameters of repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions while leaving space for effective market-making, enabling parties to enter into repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions in a transparent manner. Directions were also intended to address the shortfalls in the regulatory framework identified during the failure of one of the Primary Dealers and the supervision of other DDPs.
