FISCAL POLICY AND GOVERNMENT FINANCE

6.1 Overview

The fiscal policy in2004 was directed at achieving the targetsstipulated in the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act(FMRA) and the objectives laid down in the Economic PolicyFramework of the Government of Sri Lanka (EPF-GOSL)

released in July 2004. Thus, the fiscalpolicy thrust was placedon continuing the fiscal consolidation process, increasingpubli c investmenf , strengtheni n g debt mana_qe me nt, developin gdebt markets, restructuring public enterprises, providin_e reliefto the general public, while enhancin-e transparency andaccountability in conducting fiscal operations.The overall fiscal management and the maintenance offiscal targets, however, became challenging in2004, due toadverse external and domestic shocks that led to a slippage inrevenue collection and an over run in expenditure. In addition,the delays and lower than the expected toreign financing andprivatisation proceeds aggravated the difficulty in managingpublic finances.It is encouraging that the declinin-e trend in tax/GDP ratioreversed in2004 reflecting the impact of rvidening the tax baseand improving the tax collection. However, the annual taxcollection recorded a shortfall of 0.9 per cent of GDP comparedto the budgetary target of 14.8 per cent in2004. Similarly, theexpenditure oveffun was about 0.3 per cent of GDP increasingthe central government overall fiscal deficit from the target of6.8 per cent of GDP (which was subsequently changed to 1.3per cent with the Pre Election Budgetary Position Report inFebruary 2004) to 8.2 per cent, The concomitant public sectordeficit increased to 8.4 per cent of GDP as a result ofoperational losses of non-financial public corporations, mainly,the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and the CeylonElectricity Board (CEB).

The increased public sector deticits were financed largelythrough borrowings from domestic sources, The total netdomestic borrowing of the government increased to Rs. 117billion (5.8 per cent of GDP) compared to the original target of

Rs.65 billion (3.2per cent of GDP). Similarly, the outstandingbanking debt of public corporations rose by Rs. 5 billion to Rs.41.2 billion in2004. Consequently, the central government debtand the public sector debt accounted to 105.5 and 107.5 percent of GDP, respectively, by end 2004.In 2004, the government introduced a series of measuresto improve the fiscal performance, Major measures includedthe followings: reforming the tax and tariff systems;strengthening tax administration, inter alia, by setting up of the

Revenue Board, introducing Economic Service Charge (ESC),

rationalising recuffent expenditure, and revising administrativeprices; strengthening public enterprises by setting up theStrate_qic Enterprises Management Agency (SEMA);strengthening administrative reforms by establishin-e theAdministrative Reforms Committee (ARC) and the NationalCouncil for Administration (NCA), and enhancingtransparency and accountability in govemment operations by

adhering to reporting requirements of the FMRA and setting upof the National Procurement Agency (NPA). Priority was alsogiven to public investment to stimulate sustainable andregionally balanced economic growth. These measures wouldhelp resolve several major drawbacks on the fiscal front, such

as declining revenuelGDP ratio, under performance of thepublic investment prograrnme, consistently high budget deficits

and high public debt burden. The timely rectification of thosedrawbacks is important, as their impact could spill over to therest of the macroeconomic management efforts through highdemand pressures, excessive resources requirement, and

crowdin-e out of private investment.The Budget2005 has outlined the expected medium termmacroeconomic framework, aiming at a steady improvementin fiscal performance, high savings and investment and higheconomic growth, moderate inflation, and improved extemal

balances. The medium term macroeconomic framework will beatfected particularly by the tsunami disaster as the country hasto incur relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction (RRR)expenditure. The key macroeconomic targets, i.e., GDPgrowth, inflation and reserve build-up are expected to bemaintained. The RRR would require an estimated resources

requirement of about US dollars 1.8 billion in the medium term.In view of the domestic resource constraints, it is essential to

ensure the pledged foreign assistance is received, timely, for thegovernment to make steady progress in this effort.

Summary of Government Fiscal Operations

attempted through implementin-g measures to enhance revenue,while rationalisin-u expenditure. The public investmentprogramme was formulated to absorb maximum possible

amount of concessional forei,en funds, while streamlinin-e the

rupce funded investments on a priority basis. New strategieswere adopted to increase commercial viability of public

enterprises under the EPF-GOSL. Fiscal transparency andaccountability was strengthened by adheLing to reportin-e

requiremetrts of the FMRA, and settin-q up of the NPA. Tax andexpenditure policies u,ere also used to provide relief to the

-eeneral public in 2004.Several policy measures were taken to increase tax

revenue, as revenue au-ementation is the main contributor in the

envisa-eed fiscal consolidation process in SLi Lanka. Major

policy measures include the relbrmin-q of the Value Added Tax(VAT) system, introduction of ESC, and stren-ethenin-e tax

administration. N{easures were also taken to improve revenue

by stren-ethening the income tax system, revising excise taxes

upwards and reforming the taliff system. In addition, a new

law was introduced in 2004 limiting the covelage of the tax

amnesty granted under the Inland Revenue (Special Provisions)

Acts in 2002 md 2003 in order to minimise potential revenue

slippages. Accordingly, tax amnesty rvas made applicable only

fbr income taxes.

Reforms in VAT include unifying the two-band VAT rates

(10 per cent and 20 per cent) to a single rate (15 per cent), and

streamlinin-e the tax collection and refunds process through

administrative reforms. Compensating changes were made to

import and excise duties to neutralise revenue losses due tounification oi VAT rates. Durin-e the year, excise duty on

selected motor vehicles were raised substantially to discourage

the import of fuel inefficient vehicles. In addition, duty

concessions were granted on several food items and inputs to

provide relief to the general public.

The purpose of imposin-e ESC on April 1,2004 was to

brin-e the corporate entities which were not payin-e corporate

taxes into the tax net. In addition, income tax exemptions were

rationalised, withholdin-e and income tax bases were widened,

and tax compliance was improved through revisions made to

non compliance of re-eistration requirements of the Inland

Revenue Department (IRD).

The tax administration was strengthened by appointin-e

a Revenue Board (RB) comprisin-q Secretary to the Treasury,

and heads of IRD, Sri Lanka Customs, Excise Department

and the Board of Investments (BOI). The RB is entrustedwith improvin-e the revenue administration system by

addressing the fragmented and compartmentalised nature ofthe existin-q system, improving its effectiveness and

improving laboul relations. A taxation cluster was appointedin 2004 under the National Council for Economic

Development (NCED) to facilitate the implementation of tax

policies outlined in the bud-eet and to formulate the overall

tax reforms in line with the developments rn the economy.

proposed Tax Charter would help create a taxpayer friendlyenvironment and a community healthy taxpayers.Furthermore, the establishment of Dedicated Tax Coults andproposed appointment of an independent Tax Ombudsmanwould facilitate fair and expeditious settlement of taxpayers'

-[rievances and speedy dispensation of tax related cases. ACclde of Conduct has been cilculated among employees inthe IRD to improve accountability of employees.To further strengthen the process of f-iscal consolidation,efforts were taken to contain in recurrent expenditure. Agradual reduction of def'ence expenditure, as a per cent ofGDP, was envisaged along with the continuation of ceasefireagreement. Improved fiscal mana,qement and low interestrates were expected to be helpful in reducing the interestcost, The qovernment took initiatives to correct theadministrative prices and fees and char_ees to a certain degreeduring the year to reduce the budgetary transf'ers arisin_u fromfactors such as escalating oil prices. The public investmentpro_qramme was directed towards increasin-e forei_gn fundedpro-qrammes, while limiting the rupee funded non priorityprogrammes.

The new govemment institution, SEMA, was establishedto restructure strategic public enterprises while retaining thegovernment ownership. The objectives of restructuring wereto rmprove mana.qement and efficiency in strategicenterprises so that they would be commercially viable,financially self-supportin-9 and free from politicalinterferences, while ensuring tieedom for commercial pricing,human resource mana_qement and procurement decisions. Theoperations of 12 major strategic enterprises have been

brou_sht under the supervision of the SEMA.T The PublicEnterprise Refbrm Commission (PERC) continued the refbrmprocess of other public enterprises, facilitatin_q the efficiencyand competitiveness of these enterprrses.As a measure to alleviate the chronic unemploymentproblem amon-q graduates, 42,588 unemployed graduateswere provided with trainin_e opportunities, with anunderstanding, once they successfully complete trainin_r, theycould be absorbed into the public service to fitl the existingvacancies. The government's function, as the employer oflast resort, has been resorted to by many previous

-qovernments in view of the hi_eh socio- political well-beingit would -generate. Horvever, fbr the program to be successfulin the long run without being a burden on the future taxpayers, it is necessary that the improvements in the efficiencyof the public sector as a result of the new recruitments shouldbe positively contributed to the future economic _erowththereby expanding the tax base. This could be attained byor_qanising the trainin,q pro_qramme to make an attitudinal1 The |2 strategic enterprises are Bank of Ceylon, People's Bank, NationalSavings Bank, State Mortgage and Investment Bank, Ceylon Electricity Board,Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, Sri Lanka Ports Authority, Airports and AviationAuthority of Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka Railways, Central Transport Board and allregional Cluster Bus Companies, National Waler Supply and Drainage Boardand State Pharmaceutical Corporation.

chan-ee in these graduates, while enablin-e them to acquirenew technical skills and competencies to perform better. Inthis connection, the three step recruitment process, first,trainin-s of graduates in _eeneral skills development, second,providin_e them on the job trainin_q and finally, recruitingthem to fill specific vacancies in the public sector, can beconsidered as a proper strate_ey to address this issue.As stipulated under the FMRA, the medium term fiscalpolicy of the government was presented in tkee statements, viz,Fiscaf Strategy Statement -2005, Bud-eet Economic and FiscalPosition Report, and Medium Term MacroeconomicFramework for 2005-2008 along with the Budget 2005 inNovember 2004. Accordin_e to these statements, the mediumterm policy is directed at continuing the fiscal consolidationprocess mainly by enhancing revenue and rationalisin_erecurrenI expenditure, while refraining from compressingcapital expenditure to maintain budgetary targets. This process

needs to be complemented by the continuation of tax reforms,public enterprises reform, pension reforms through contributorypension system, civil service reforms and the development ofthe domestic bond market to improve the sustainability of thefiscal consolidation programme. Further, the fiscal adjustmentsrvill be directed aimin_{ at achieving a surplus in the currentaccount and eliminating infl ationary financing, promotin_{public expenditure on human resources development andquality public investments in infrastructure and ruraldevelopment, while -eivin_{ priority to pro-poor-pro-growthdevelopment strategy with a strong focus on reducing rural andurban poverty as well as lowerin_9 regional income disparities.

6.3 Central Government BudgetaryOperations

The budget deficit increased from 8.0 per cent of GDP in 2003to 8.2 per cent in2004, a considerably higher deficit than thetarget of 6.8 per cent planned in Budget 2004, as a result ofrevenue slippages and additional expenditure on subsidies. Thecurrent account deficit increased to 3.9 per cent tiom 3.3 per

cent of GDP and primary deficit increased to 2.2 per cent fi'om0.9 per cent of GDP in 2003, revealing significant deviationsfrom targets of 1.3 per cent and 0.8 per cent of GDP envisagedin Budget 2004. As a result, the debt dependency ratio, theratio of total net bonowings relative to the total expenditure ofthe government, increased to 32 per cent from 29 per cent in

2003,

Revenue

The _{overnment revenue declined to 15.4 per cent of GDP in2004, from 15.7 per cent in 2003. [t also declined a_qainst the

bud,eetary tar-[et of L6.4 per cent of GDP in 2004. The revenue

was composed of 90 per cent tax revenue and l0 per cent non-tax revenue. Thus, the decline in revenue as a percenta_ge ofGDP was due to a substantial decline in non-tax revenue,

althou_eh the tax revenue as a percentage of GDP increasedreversing the historical trend.

The income tax revenue declined due to the lowwithholding tax collection from government securities. Theimposition of ESC partially compensated for the reduction in

the income tax revenue, as it resulted in the corporates' paying

a tax even when they were showing accumulated losses. Anyfurther reduction in income tax revenue was checked by theintroduction of measures to rationalise the tax incentives andconcessions, which are the major slipping sources of tax

revenue.

Expenditure

The total expenditure, composed of recurrent expenditure, andcapital expenditure and net lending, decreased marginally to23.5 per cent in 2004 from 23.7 per cent of GDP in the previous

year. The recunent expenditure as a per cent of GDP increasedto 19.2 per cent from 19 per cent in 2003 and the original

budgetary target of 17.6 per cent. The capital expenditure andnet lending declined from 4.7 per cent of GDP in 2003 to 4.3

per cent in2004.The increase in recunent expenditure was largely due to

the significantly increased transfers to households and public

corporations in 2004 and the marginal increase in the salarybill. hadequate revisions in administered prices, inefficienciesin some public corporations and the cost of living alleviation

measures were attributed to the increase in transfers. The

marginal decrease in expenditure on Samurdhi programme was

mainly due to the slight decrease in the number of beneficiaries

under the programme. The revisions introduced to the fertiliser

subsidy scheme led to an increase in the expenditure related toit. Among the other welfare transfers to households,

expenditure on school uniforms increased mainly due to the

recommencement of the system of providing uniforms to allschool students, instead of the targeting only the needy

children. The interest payments declined in2004 benefited by

the low interest rate regime, and the premium collected from

issuing government Treasury bonds.This increase in expenditure coupled with a revenue

slippage in 2004 compelled the government to reduce the rupee

funded public investment programme thereby reducing the total

The non-tax revenue declined from 2.5 per cent to L5 percent of GDP in 2004, reflecting the non implementation of

some of the budget proposals. These included the transfer offunds from dormant EPF accounts and sale of government

lands, and lower than expected profit transfers from the Central

Bank,The tax revenue increased to 13.9 per cent from 13.2 percent of GDP in 2003, reflecting increases in revenue fromVAT, import duty and excise duty, despite the reduction in therevenue from the income tax. The revenue from VAT

increased due to both improvements in VAT administration and

the refund mechanism. Upward revisions of excise taxes andimport duties coupled with increased values of production andimports which are subject to such taxes contributed to the

increases in revenue.

Financing the Budget Deficit

In financing the overall de ficit of Rs. 165.4 billion, the

government relied more on the domestic sources due to lowerforeign inflows and privatisation proceeds. Net domestic

bonowings amounted to Rs. I17.2 billion, net foreign financing

amounted to Rs. 45.7 billion, and privatisation proceeds

amounted to Rs. 2.4 billion, as against expected budgeted

financing of Rs. 65 billion, Rs. 59.9 billion and Rs. l3 billion,

respectively.In the domestic front, the government borrowed from both

non-bank (Rs. 74 billion) and bank sources (Rs. 43 billion).Major sources of non-bank financing were Employees'

Provident Fund (EPF) (52 per cent) and National Savings Bank(NSB) (20 per cent). The Central Bank was the only source of

bank financing, as there was a net repayment to the commercial

banks amounting to Rs. 23 billion.

The financing instruments were Treasury bonds (Rs. 157billion), Treasury bills (Rs. 25 billion), and Sri Lanka

Table 6.5

Sources of Domestic FinancingRs.billion

Development Bonds (SLDBs) (Rs. l6 billion). The reliance on

non marketable debt instruments was minimised in 2004 with

a retirement of Rupee loans up to Rs, 84 billion, including an

early retirement of callable Rupee loans amounting to Rs. 60billion.The issue of Treasury bonds played a key role in thedomestic borrowing programme in 2004. On a net basis,bonowings from Treasury bonds increased significantly from

Rs. 137 billion in 2003 to Rs. 157 billion in 2004. However, the

maturity structure of Treasury bonds largely was leading to the

shorter end of the market reflectin-u the market preference forsuch instruments in a back-eround of rising inflationary

expectations. As the leeway in the Treasury bill programme

reached Rs. 9.7 billion at end November 2004, the bonowinglimit applicable to Treasury bills was tevised upwards by the

Parliament by Rs. 50 billion to Rs. 300 billion.

The value of SLDBs issued in 2004 was US dollars 250million. A part of the proceeds was utilised to repay matudng

SLDBs of US dollars 91.5 million. The US dollar denominated

loans (US dollars 100 million) obtained from foreign currency

banking units (FCBUs) and matured in mid 2004 were rolled

over in 20M.In 2004, the -{overnment was able to raise, on a gross

basis, US dollars 772 million (Rs. 78.3 billion) from foreign

sources in comparison to US dollars 912 million (Rs. 88billion) in the previous year. Of this, a major part wasreceived by way of project loans from bilateral and

multilateral donors (US dollars 683 million). The receiptsby way of programme financing were only US dollars 30million (Rs. 3 billion) in comparison to US dollars 344million (Rs. 33 billion) in 2003. The balance consisted of

forei,qn commercial loans. As the repayment of foreignloans amounted to Rs. 33 billion, including deferred

payments of Rs. 2.8 billion, the net receipts amounted toRs. 37.1 billion. The utilisation rate of available forei-{n

assistance decreased considerably to 18 per cent from 24

per cent in the previous year, highlightin-e the necessity forcontinuing with related efforts at expediting theimplementation of foreign funded projects and the

implementation of structural reforms in time.The amount of foreign grants received for budgetary

purposes, as a per cent of GDP, decreased marginally in2004.

The governments of Japan, Germany and USA continued as the

major bilateral donors for Sri Lanka.

6.4 Sub National Government BudgetaryOperations

In Sri Lanka, the sub national -qovernment (SNG) system

consists of Provincial Councils (PCs) and Local Governments

(LGs). There are 8 PCs that have been established under thedecentralisation of the decision making process by the

devolution of powers to PCs. The local government system

Performance of Local Governments

The LGs continued to perform the functions assigned to themmainly using their devolved revenue and transfers from thecentral -qovernment. In collecting some of the devolvedrevenues such as property transfer taxes and court fines asassigned under the l3'r'Amendment to the Constitution, PCsworked as the agent for LGs. The outlays of LGs includedpersonal emoluments, other current expenses and capitalexpenses.The effective functionin_e of LGs has been hampered bya lack of competent technical staff and an inappropriateadministration structure. The ineff'ectiveness is manifested inthe non-availability of effective record keepin_q systems, andweaknesses in regulation and monitoring.6.5 Public Sector Debt and Debt ServicePayments

Central Government Debt

The total outstanding government debt stock remained ataround 106 per cent of GDP in 2004 due to the increaseddeficit and the depreciation of the rupee against majorforeign cunencies.

Under the current systenr, PCs and LGs enjoy only alimited devolution of power to mobilise required resources, andthey suffer fiom a weak institutional framework. They alsofunction largely as administrative arms of the centralgovernment rather than devolved fiscal structures. Thus, theyrely heavily on central government transfers for theiroperations, without making efforts to build-up their resourcebase adequately.

Performance of Provincial Councils

The overall budgetary operations of PCs in 2004 remained asin 2003. The revenue collection of PCs, as a per cent of GDP,remained at 0.7 per cent as in the previous year, while totalexpenditure also remained at 2.8 per cent as in the previousyear.The increased revenue of PCs, in nominal terms, wasmainly due to the si_enificant increase in revenue from turnovertaxes and stamp duties. About 72 per cent of the total revenuewas collected fiom these two sources, Western ProvincialCouncil (WPC) accounted fot 67 per cent of the total revenuecollection, due to high concentration of commercial andindustrial activities and the high population in the WPC. TheCentral, Southern and North Western Provinces were the othermajor revenue collecting PCs. The central govemment collectsthe provincial taxes in the North and East PC due to theproblems related to ethnic contlict.Of the total expenditure, the recurrent expenditureremained unchanged at2.3 per cent of GDP as in 2003. Themajor portion (92 per cent) of personal emoluments was

absorbed by the education (67 per cent) and health (25 per cent)sectors. Other current expenditure was used for other non-wa-ee

expenses on -uoods and services.The investment programme of PCs, which mainlyconsisted of Province Specific Development Projects (PSDP)

Non Financial Public Corporation Debt

The outstanding debt stock of non financial public corporations(NFPC) to the banking system increased from Rs 36.2 billion

to Rs.4l.2 billion (2per cent of GDP) at end 2004. The CPC,

CEB and Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) were

the major debtors, accounting for 90 per cent of the total NFPC

debt. This reflected the accumulated losses of NFPCs mainly

due to delays and inadequacies in adjustment of their prices at

least to cover the cost of production.

Public Sector Debt

The outstanding debt stock of the public sector, which includes

the central government and NFPCs, increased from Rs 1,900billion as at end 2003 to Rs. 2,181 billion at the end 2004. Asa percentage of GDP, the public sector debt decreasedmarginally from 107.9 to 107.5 per cent of GDP in 2004.Although the debt level was marginally declined in 2004, thislevel of public debt poses serious issues, in the form of a

growing public debt over- hang at the expense of private sectorgrowth, rising interest payment commitments, adverseimplications of monetary policy, and a real reduction in thecountry's ability to withstand external shocks. Hence, it is

necessary for the government to actively pursue to attain the

targets set out in FMRA.

Debt Service Payments

Total debt service payments composed of governmentamortisation payments (Rs. 180,8 billion) and interest

payments (Rs. 119.8 billion) to domestic and external sectorsin2004 amounted to Rs. 300.6 billion. Of this total, payments

to the domestic sector amounted to Rs. 253.6 billion, while that

to the external sector was Rs. 47 billion.The total debt service payments decreased by

12.8 per cent in 2004 due to a decline in the domestic debtservice payments. However, the foreign debt service

payments increased due to increased interest payments onforeign debt.The ratio of total debt service payments togovernment revenue was high at 96.5 per cent.Even though this ratio showed a relative improvemenf

In 2004 over the period of last two years (108.6 in 2002and 124.6 in 2003), it still limits the manoeuvrin_qabilities of flscal operations. Follorving the same trend, thetotal foreign debt service payments to exports ofgoods and services declined to 6.4 per cent in 2004from 7,3 per cent in 2003. The highly concessional natureof the outstanding foreign debt was the reason for this lowerrate, although the foreign debt to GDP ratio was 49 per centin 2004.In 2005, total debt service payments of the governmentis estimated at Rs. 395.4 billion. This consists of Rs. 334.7billion payments to the domestic sector and Rs. 60,7 billionpayments to the external sector. A debt moratorium wasgranted by the donors in the Paris Club (which includes G-7 countries) for 2005 as a relief to the country to assist thenation rebuildin-u programme in tsunami affected areas.
