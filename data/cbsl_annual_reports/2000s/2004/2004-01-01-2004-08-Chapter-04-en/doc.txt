PRICES, WAGES AND EMPLOYMENT

4.1 Overview

As was projected at the beginning of the year, the price inflation

in 2004 recorded a gradual downward movement fbr some time

and then began its upward trend. This was observed in the caseof all the price indices, first at the primary market level andthen, at the retail market level. Accordin,ely, the factors that

contributed to improve price stability through the previous

years, turned unfavourable since the middle of 2004.Factors attributable to the observed price and wagedevelopments during 2004 related to both the demand and

supply sides of the economy, among which supply side factorswere dominant. The economy experienced supply shocksoriginating both internally and externally. Internally, the

prolonged drought in certain areas from the latter part of 2003through most of 2004 had an adverse impact on key

domestically produced tbod items, which represent relatively

high shares in all measures of inflation, and exerted upward

pressure on their prices. Extemally, the strong global demandduring the year pushed up the international prices of keycommodities, specifically that of petroleum products,generating cost-push inflation. International prices of most

consumer imports increased in 2004 in contrast to price

decreases for some of them and lower price increases for othersin the previous year. The depreciation of the rupee againstmajor currencies, as reflected by the movements of theNominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER), aggravated thesituation by exacerbating the adverse impact of rising

international prices of imports to Sri Lanka. Thus, the costs ofkey imported inputs such as fertiliser, raw materials and fuelwent up, raising the cost structure of most domesticallyproduced goods, and generating cost-push inflationary

pressures. These supply side factors rvere also reinforced by atrade policy that protected domestic farmers through the

maintenance of limits on imports of rice, that has the highest

single share in all measures of inflation, despite a drop in itsdomestic production by l5 per cent during the year. Theupward revision of the Value Added Tax (VAT) on imports

also contributed to cost-push pressures.

The expansion of money supply at a higher rate of around20 per cent in 2004 compared to around l5 per cent in the

previous year added demand side pressures on prices by raisingliquidity levels in the economy. A higher bud-{et deficit partlyfinanced throu-eh banking sources and an accelerated credit

expansion to the private sector contributed to the monetary

expansron.Wage developments too had an impact on the priceinflation in the country. Nominal wages in the public sector

which had remained unchanged in 2003 rvere revised uprvards

at both the beginning and end of the year. The increase at the

be-einning of the year, at hi-eher rates than justifLed by the

prevailin-e inflation rates resultin-e in increases in real wages

without apparent commensurate improvement in productivity,

also contributed to the price pressure during the year simply by

raising the a-egregate demand. In contrast to public sector wage

developments, some formal private sector employee categories

suffered losses in real minimum wa-qes, while nominal wa-gesin the informal private sector generally kept abreast with

inflation.In 2004, there was a slowing down of the progress oflabor.rr reforms. On the policy front, following on

representations made by trade unions, the Ministry of LabourRelations and Foreign Employment (MLRFE) through acabinet decision on 26 May 2004, suspended the

implementation of the amended Termination of Employmentof Workmen Act (TEWA), which came into operation in

December 2003, and in June 2004 formed the National LabourAdvisory Council (NLAC), comprising the MLRFE, trade

unions and representatives from employers, to review the entire

labour market reforms programme. The main task of the NLAC

was to decide on a new compensation formula with an

unemployment benefit scheme to provide income support todisplaced workers. The nerv formula was formulated by

October 2004 and is due to be gazetted with an unemployment

benefit scheme in early 2005.

Population growth slorved down marginally from 1.3 per

cent in 2003 to Ll pel cent in 2004. Meanwhile, district-wisedifferences were observed in growth rates, where areas

previously affected by the security situation registeredrelatively higher growth in population under a relatively

peaceful environment with the continuation of the ceasefire.

However, the labour fbrce participation rate had declined with

the inclusion of the Northern Province, where the participation

rate was relatively low. The employment rate had increasedmar-uinally with the expansion of economic activity,particularly in the Services sector. The employment rate was

also supported by the expansion in public sector employment

opportunities under the policy of the new government and its

subsequent drive to recruit graduates to the public sector.However, unemployment, recording a marginal rise in theoverall rate durin-e the year, remained an area of concern,particularly among the educated youth.

The Tsunami tidal wave disaster, which devastated a large

area of the coastal belt on 26December2004, claimed around

30,000 to 40,000 lives when both confirmed deaths and the

missin-q are taken into account. In addition, around 100,000

houses were destroyed or dama-eed, leadin-{ to the displacement

of around half a million people (2-3 per cent of the population).

The direct impact on the labour fbrce may be seen in 2005 in

the form of a lower labour force participation rate or a higher

unemployment rate. At the same time, the situation could alsoreverse with a higher demand for labour under a dynamicreconstruction and rehabilitation programme.The impact of the Tsunami disaster on prices and wageswill also manifest itself in 2005 in certain sectors. The fisheries

immediately due to a temporarily low demand, but have risen

since then with the demand picking up. The supply shortage is

expected to continue until the required infrastructure is in place.

IMeanwhile, prices of other protein substitutes have already

risen. Tradin,e activities in the affected areas have also been

disrupted. Marketing and distribution to those costal areas will

take a while to recover, so that prices and wa-Qes in thoseeconomic sectors will also remain affected for a period.Rehabilitation and reconstruction activities could also exert

excessive pressure on input prices including skilled labour

4.2 Prices

Price Movements of Goods and Services

Prices of most domestically produced goods and services, aswell as imported goods, increased at different rates durin,q theyear compared to prices in the previous year. Among

domestically produced agricultural goods, prices dropped for

certain goods during the first half of the year, but rose at very

hi-gh rates during the second half, generally reflectin,e theproduction situation during the year. In 2003, rice prices

dropped within a range of 4 to 12 per cent with the growth in

production, whereas, they increased within a range of 15 to 21

per cent in2004 with the drop in both Maha (12 per cent) andYala (20 per cent) production. During the second half alone,

prices of all varieties of rice increased in a range of 30 to 46

per cent. Prices of coconut, another important domesticallyproduced consumer item, dropped in 2004 over the levels in2003 by around 2 per cent, althou_eh overall production fell.This overall outcome was due to price declines in a range of 22to 23 percent during the first half of the year when the crop

increased and increases ofaround 25 to 28 per cent during the

second half when production fell. Prices of vegetables recordedmixed trends. With the increase in the Maha ve-qetable harvest,prices fell in general in the early part of the year, but rosethereafter. Prices of protein sources, dift-erent varieties of seaand inland fish and dried t'ish, different varieties of meat andmeat products, fresh milk, milk based products and e_egs,

increased during the year in a range of I to l3 per cent. Unlikerice and coconuts, prices of protein sources were higherthroughout the year compared to the previous year. Almost allvarieties of domestically produced fruits also recordedsomewhat higher prices in 2004 although production rose.

These price increases marked continuation of the price

increases observed over the past few years. Increasin-u demandfor protein sources and the rising costs of inputs and transport

could have contributed to such developments,Among imported goods, price increases were observed inall three major categories of imports, consumer goods,intermediate goods and investment goods. Prices of both

consumer goods and intermediate -eoods had an adverse impact

on overall price movements durin-e the year itself. The impactof the price increases of investment goods on other prices will

be felt with a time la-e. Amon-q major food imports, si-enificantprice increases in US Dollar terms were observed for wheat

grain (24 per cent), milk powder (18 per cent), rice ( l0 per cent)

and sugar (10 per cent). Prices of most imported fruits also

increased during the year. l'he impact of price increases ofintermediate goods, especially fuel prices, were moresignificant in2004 than 2003. The US Dollar price of a banel

of crude oil increased by around 27 per cent in 2004 a-eainst l7

per cent in 2003. The corresponding increases for LP -qas were

20 per cent and l7 per cent. Fertiliser prices also increased byl7 and 2l per cent, respectively, International price increases

coupled with rupee depreciation raised domestic fuel prices in

a ran-qe of 0 to 38 per cent. Gas prices too increased by l1 to

12 per cent. These price increases had a secondary impact ontransport and other sectors that use them as major inputs.Accordingly, bus fares, railway fares and charges on other

modes of transport, such as three rvheelers and vans, increased

durin-e the year.The intermediate input prices in the food processin-qindustry also had an impact on the prices of prepared food.Accordingly, prices of bread and flour based products increasedby around 3 per cent. Prices of a variety of prepared foods

recorded price increases in a range of 4 to l0 per cent. Amongnon food items, price increases were observed for householditems and services, particularly private tuition classes and

medical consultancy charges, reflecting the spiraling impact of

risin-e inflation by the end of the year.

Provincial Price Variations

Variations in prices among provinces exist due to variation inthe availability of soods and their quality differences. Theavailability, in turn, depends on the area of production andefficiency in distribution. Within the overall trend of price

increases, regional price variations, in different degrees, were

observed across different commodities. Estimated Coefficientof Variation values (CVs)r for rice, potatoes, dried chillies,coconut and eggs were below 5 per cent. The CVs for big

onions, brinjals and fish were above l0 per cent. Accordin-ely.

the commodities that are more perishable, and hence, subject

to more quality variations, had hi-eher CVs. Comparison of CVsin2004 with those in previous years indicated that regionalvariability among prices of key consumer items has narroweddown further, despite the increase in the overall price level.

1 The Coefficient of Variation (CV) is a statislical measure that measures the av-erage variability of the values of a given item relative to its average value. Ac-cordingly, a lower CV indicates less variability and vice versa. This statistic canbe used to analyse relalive price variation among the provinces.

Continuation of the ceasefire and further improvements in thedistribution channels due to improvements in intra regionalroad networks, expansion of the -eoods transport fleet andtimely availability of information about market conditionsalong with expansion in telecommunication facilities hal'e

contributed to these developments in the recent past.

Consumer Price Indices

The year 2004 commenced rvith falling inf-lation registered byall available Consumer Price Indices (CPIs), continuing the

moderation of inflation observed throughout the past two years,

before bottomin-e out by the second quarter of the year, Thistrend was consistent among all CPIs, which signaled risin-{

price pressure durin-{ the second half of 2004.

The overiding influence on aggre-eate inflation remained

domestically produced goods, which represent around 75 per

cent of total consumption expenditure2 and are dominated by

food items. Imported items directly account for the balance 25

per cent of consumption expenditure which is also dominated

by food items. The persistently hi-eher price pressure, especially

during the second half, was mainly due to the overall increasein prices of food, which represents around 60 per cent of thetotal weight across all CPIs. Hence, the rise in internationalcommodity prices also contributed to domestic inflation in2004. Hence, price increases of both imported goods anddomestically produced goods contributed to the overallinflation durin-u the year. On the whole, relatively lower prices

of most agricultural commodities at the beginning of the year,

was the key factor responsible for the lower inflation rate at the

commencement of the year, despite the rise in import prices.

The revision of the applicable VAT rate on imported food

items from l0 per cent to 15 per cent f'rom January 2004 had

an upward impact on the prices of most imported food items.

However, the impact of risin-q international commodity prices,

both directly as well as through input costs, particularly of

unusually high crude oil prices, was evident in the domestic

inflation thereafter, and was partly responsible for reversin-{ the

dorvnward inf'lation trend from the second quarter of the year.

2 Prices of domestically produced goods are also sensitive to import price changes

due to heavy dependence on imported intermediate inputs.

The month to month changes in the indices indicatedupward pressure on prices as they were higher than thehistorical seasonal chan-qes for most months of the year. Thepoint to point changes, (which measure the change in the indexin any month compared to the value of the index in the

correspondin-e month of the previous year), which continuously

rose throughout 2004, were hi,sher in the second half of the year

and greater than l0 per cent for most indices durin-q this period

. Accelerating pressure on prices durin-e the second half was

denoted by these significantly higher point to point increases

compared to those of the conesponding months of the previousyear. Consequently, all CPIs recorded relatively higher and

risin-e annual average inflation rates in a range of 5 to 8 per centby the end of the year, compared to -l to 6 per cent in the

prevlous year.

The annual average increase of the Colombo Consumers'Price Index (CCPI), the official measure of the cost of theliving, reached 3.7 per cent in May, its lowest annual average

increase since January 2002, and then rose continuously toreach 7.6 per cent by the end of the year. The Sri LankaConsumers' Price Index (SLCPI), which has a broadergeographical as well as income -sroup coverage representing

the price movements of the country as a whole and having morerecent weights than the CCPI, behaving in a similar way,plummeted at the beginning of the year to reach its lowest

annual average change oli 1.2 per cent in March and rose faster

thereafter to reach 1 .9 per cent by end 2004. The conespondingrates of inflation were lower at 6.3 and 2.6 per cent,respectively, in the previous year.Among the sub indices of the CCPI that represent pricemovements of various consumption expenditure groups, foodand miscellaneous items re_qistered higher annual averageincreases compared to their corresponding increases in the

previous year. The Food sub index, which represents the highest

share of around 62 per cent in the CCPI basket, re-eistered an

annual avera-qe increase of around 8 per cent, higher than the 6

per cent re-eistered for 2003. Similarly, the food sub index of theSLCPI having a weight of 7l per cent, increased by around 9

per cent relative to the I per cent increase recorded in 2003 on

an annualised basis. The acceleration in the pressure from food

prices was indicated by a point to point increase of around l6

per cent in the CCPI Food sub index during 2004, compared to

around 4 per cent in the previous year. This trend was minoredin the SLCPI as well, where the food sub index in the SLCPI

rose by 20 per cent, point to point, in contrast to the decline ofaround I per cent recorded in 2003. Consequently, the

respective indices indicated that the contribution of food prices

to the overall inflation, was greater than 70 per cent in 2004, in

comparison to 67 per cent in the previous year for the CCPI and

less than 40 per cent in the SLCPL

The Fuel and Light sub index with a share of around 4 per

cent of the CCPI basket re-eistered an annual average increase

of around l0 per cent compared to I5 per cent during 2003. Thecontribution of the Fuel and Light category to overall int-lation

was around I I per cent, in relation to 19 per cent in 2003. This

increase was mainly driven by higher prices of firewood as

there were no revisions to kerosene prices durin-e the year. The

prices of firewood would have increased due to higher demandfi'om households, as well as small scale restaurants and fastfood outlets, following on the price increase of alternative

energy sources such as LP gas. The relative sub index in theSLCPI with a wei-eht of 13 per cent rose at a relatively lower

rate of around 6 per cent durin-e the year, which ret'lected the

rise in L.P. gas prices, which has a mar-einal representation of

around 0.2 per cent, in addition to the prices of firewood. The

relative contribution to the overall inflation from this sector was

around l0 per cent fbr 2004.

The increase in international prices of crude oil and gas,

and the consequential upward revision of domestic fuel pricesled to an increase in transport charges. This was clearlyreflected in the Transport sub index of the SLCPI, which had

the hi-chest annual avera-qe increase fbr the year of around I I

per cent compared to 8 per cent in the previous year. This sub

index, havin-e an expenditure share of 4 per cent in the index,

was responsible for around 5 per cent of the overall inflationin2004. The CCPI, with the exception of revisions to kerosene

prices, only captures the indirect impact of fuel price increases,which however includes bus fares, in the Miscellaneous sub-index. The Miscellaneous sub index with a somewhat higherweight of around 19 per cent in the CCPI was responsible forl4 per cent of the resultant inflation for the year.

The Clothing sub-indices, with relative shares of 4 and 9

per cent in the two CPIs increased by less than 5 per cent durrng

the year. There was relatively lower price pressure from this

category, with the contribution to inflation being less than 4 per

cent.The Health and Leisure, entertainment and culture subindices of the SLCPI increased by 10 and 8 per cent,

respectivel y , in 2004, higher than the increases recorded for theprevious year. The increased expenditure on health was

responsible fol around 5 per cent of the rise in the overall pricelevel durin-q the year, while the latter category contributing

mar-einally. The impact of other sub-indices on the a-ggregateprice level was marginal in 2004.

Regional Price Indices

The Central Bank measures the cost of living in different

regions through the movements of regional CPIs compiled forthe districts of Colombo (CDCPI), Anuradhapura (APCPI),

Matale(MLCPI), and Matara (MRCPI). The prices at regionallevel as measured by these 4 indices illustrated a behavioursimilar to the CCPI and SLCPI. The continuous acceleration ininflation, especially during the second half, culminated in

annual average inflation rates between 5 per cent and 8 per centby the end of the year, in comparison to the corresponding

ran-qe of -l to 3 per cent at end 2003, across the regions. Thepoint to point changes too indicated a similar trend and were

much hi-eher than in 2003, particularly during the second half.

Price variations exist across re.eions due to several factors, asdiscussed in the previous section. The inflation mainlystemming from food plices were at varying intensities across

the re-eions, due to price variations as well as the diff'erencesin the wei-eht structure of the indices, It was observed that theinflation variation was higher in other districts compared with

Colombo District, reflecting mainly differences in transpoft anddistlibution facilities.Increased imports, especially rice, followin-{ on lowerproduction in 2004, and also other domestic agriculturalcommodities, were mainly distributed from Colombo, whichstill remains the main wholesale and retail market. With added

transportation costs, which increased during the year as well,

the prices of imported goods increased further when reachin-e

re-eions outside Colombo. Despite the lower price disparities

across regions with the expansion of regionaleconomic centres,

the greater availability of the main a-ericultural products in

Colombo relative to other re-Qions at times of poor production,

and vice versa, may give rise to these regional differences.Hence, the deceleration in 2002 and 2003 and subsequent

acceleration in 2004 in inflation were sharper in the other 3districts and the country as a whole (SLCPI), compared to

Colombo District and the Colombo Municipality area (CCPI).

This was particularly so dunng the second half of 2004.

Wholesale Price Index

The Wholesale Price Index (WPD captures price movements

at the primary market level, which complements the available

CPIs in measuring changes in the general price level to some

extent, by acting as a leading indicator of possible future price

movements at the retail level. In addition to the overall index,

separate sub indices are computed under domestic, export andimport classifications, based on their origin. Sub indices arealso available according to the use of -eoods, namely, for

consumer, intermediate and investment goods.WPI movements during the year behaved very similar to

those of retail prices but somewhat earlier, thereby foretellingthe future retail price changes. The rate of annual averageintlation as measured by the WPI was hi-eher at 12.5 per centin2004 compared to 3 per cent in 2003 and the acceleration ofthe index, as measured by the point to point changes, wassignificantly higher during the second half of 2004. The price

movements of different sub cate-eories of the WPI were more

or less consistent with the behaviour of comparable categoriesof the available CPIs during the period. The Food sub-category,which has the highest weight of around 68 per cent, mainlycomprises of key items with relatively low elasticities of

demand and their prices are mainly driven by'supply sidefactors. The drought conditions resulting in low harvests,especially for rice, and the delayin-e of imports leading to

speculative pressures, resulted in higher prices. Consequently,

this would have been a factor towards the increase in other food

items as well. Hence, the food index increased by around 12 per

cent in 2004 against a drop in the previous year. The rise in this

sub category reflected the same factors that underpinned the

rise in CPI int'lation during the year. Subsequent to the increasein excise duty, liquor prices were revised upward several times

during the year and, as a result, the Alcoholic drinks sub index

recorded an increase of I I per cent, against 3 per cent in 2003.

Consequent to the increase in international prices of oil, thepetroleum product sub index, the major non food sub cate-eoryin the WPI, increased by around l5 per cent, relative to the 9per cent increase in 2003. Initially, the government absorbed

the oil price hike, but subsequently, the partialprice adjustmentfor selected petroleum products, particularly the upwardrevision of petrol and diesel prices by 32 and 37.5 per cent,respectively, impacted on several other prices in the economy

as well. The increase in vehicle tyre prices in2004, as aresult

Part IChapter 4 - PRICES, WAGES AND EMPLOYMENT

of higher international rubber prices, was mainly responsiblefor the higher annual increase of around 6 per cent in theTransport equipment sub-index in 2004. Hi_uher rubber andtobacco prices were the major contributory factors for the risein the Miscellaneous sub-index in 2004. The increase in mostbuilding materials, particularly cement and bricks, driven byincreased activity in the construction sector, and highertransport charges resulted in an increase in the Non metallicproducts group by around l6 per cent in 2004.The domestic group dominated by food items, with a shareof slightly higher than 50 per cent, increased at a higher rate ofaround l0 per cent in 2004 than 4 per cent in 2003. The slumpin agriculture production contributed to this higher pressure onprices. The imports group recorded an increase of around l0per cent in2004 mainly driven by higher prices of intermediateimports such as fuel during the year, which, however, was l2per cent in 2003. The export group, which recorded the highestannual avera-qe increase of around 17 per cent in 2004, incontrast to the decline of 3 per cent in 2003, reflected attractiveexport prices mainly for the plantation sector crops i.e. tea,rubber and coconut.Under the classification on the basis of the use of goods,consumer,{oods, which represent more than 75 per cent of theoverall index and are dominated by food items, rose by I I percent in 2004, as against the I per cent decline in the previousyear. This too was as a result of the poor performance of thea-ericulture sector durin,{ the year. Investment goods registeredan increase of 13 per cent when compared with 12 per cent in2003, while there was an increase to l8 per cent forintermediate goods due to higher fuel prices, from l5 per centin2003.

GDP Deflator

The GDP deflato13 is an implicit price indicator obtainedthrough the GDP compilation process. The detlator is the ratioof the nominal GDP in a given year to the real GDp in that year.Since the GDP deflator is based on a calculation involvin_e allthe goods produced in the economy, it is a broad price indexthat is frequently used to measure inflation at the producerlevel.The GDP deflatol confirmed the inflationary pressureindicated by other price indices in 2004. The overall indexincreased by 9.2 per cent compared with a 5 per.cent increase

Table 4.4

Percentage Change2003 2004

in 2003. The increase in ploducer prices as weil as the increasein wa-ee pressure in both the formal and informal sectorsexperienced during the year contributed to the overallmovement of the index. Sector-wise, the increasing trend wasobserved in all three sectors of the economy. In contrast, in2003, the agriculture sector displayed a low level of inflation,while inflation in the other two sectors was moderate. In 2004,a-uricultural producer prices rose in parallel with prices in theother two sectors due to high input costs. In 2004, the industrysector recorded the hi,ehest increase, largely due to the increasein cost of construction.

4.3 Wages

Wages in Sri Lanka can be analysed under two main categoriesof employment, namely, public sector and private sector. Theprivate sector can be sub-divided into two as the formal privatesector and informal private sector. The public sector too can besub-divided into two sectors as the government sector (central,provincial and local _qovernment sectors) and the semi-government sector (state corporations, statutory boards andstate authorities).Wage developments in the public sector are monitoredthrough official wage indices, which cover only the non-executive grades in central -qovernment and _qovernmentschool-teachers. The formal private sector comprises privatesector institutions that contribute to the general Employees'Provident Fund (EPF) or maintain their own provident fundswith the approval of the Commissioner of Labour. Movementsof formal sector wages are monitored throu_eh the minimum

wa,qe rate indices that cover only the minimum wage categoriesof employees governed by the Wages Boards Trades.Minimum wages are revised on the decisions of these WagesBoards. Separate wage rate indices are computed by theDepartment of Labour for three sectors, namely a-griculture,industry and commerce, and services. A consolidated wa,ee rateis also computed on a monthly basis. Information on wa_ees inthe infbrmal private sector is collected under the Country WideData Collection System (CWDCS) of the Central Bank.

Public Sector

Public Sector employees enjoyed two salary revisions, duringthe year. The first revision provided for an increase of l0 percent or Rs. 1,250, whichever was higher, with effect tiom

01,01 .2004. The second revision took etfec from 01.12.2004.This revision _granted a 40 per cent increase of the cunent basicsalary subject to a minimum of Rs. 3,250 per month and amaximum Rs. 9000 per month, plus allowances. The newsalary scales were to be implemented in two stages. Rs.2,500or 50 per cent of the proposed increase, whichever was higher,was to be with effect fl'om December 2004 and the balancefrom January 2006, subject to the recommendations of theNational Council for Adminisrratlon.These salary revisions. especially the first one, raised

per cent in nominal terms in 2004. Accordingly, the overallnominal wage rate index for government employees increasedby around 23 per cent. These increases when adjusted for theCPI inflation dunng the year gave those government employeesreal wage increases in the range of l2 to 16 per cent, with theoverall increase being l4 per cent. However, these indices onlyrepresent wa_qes of the public sector employees who fall intolow wage categories. Accordingly, many of them would havereceived the lump sum payment of Rs. 1,250 rather than the l0per cent increase. Hence, the overall public sector wageincrease in2004 would have been lower than indicated bv theavailable wa_{e indices.

Formal Private Sector

Nominal wages in the three major sectors in the formal private

sector, Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, and Services, as

sources 3:lflXlt'#;lf3o,,'ii"*"

reflected in the respective minimum wage indices, increased in

aran_qe from I to ll percent in 2004. The sector, as a whoie,experienced a nominal wage increase of 2.3 per cent. Formalprivate sector employees, in general, suffered a loss in theirminimum real wages. Only the Services sector employeesenjoyed a real minimum wage increase. However, since theminimum wage indices do not cover wages earned bymanagerial and professional categories in this sector and eventhe other benefits received in different forms, the overallsituation could be different from what is reflected in theseminimum wage indices.

Informal Private Sector

Nominal wa-qes in the informal sector are determined in a morefree market environment and respond to various factors, suchas the rising cost of living, prevailing market conditions, the

degree of labour intensity in work and alternative opportunitiesto shift amon-q different activities. The information on theinformal sector daily wa-ees collected under the CWDCS,

rvhich covers only two sectors of a-ericulture and construction,

revealed upward movements of daily wa-qes in the informal

sector at different rates.Nominal daily wa-ees in the Agriculture sector increasedwithin a range of around 7 to I I per cent during the year.The corresponding range in the construction was narrower,from around 7 to 9 per cent. Within the Agriculture sector,the four sub sectors experienced different wage increases innominal terms. Differences were observed among male andfemale wages as well, where in some sub sectors increasesin female wages were lower than for males and in othersfemale wages increased somewhat faster than for malesalthough within a relatively narrower ran-qe. Real wa-eeswithin the Agriculture sector moved in different directions,albeit marginally. Similarly, real wages within theconstruction sector moved in diff'erent directions, but withinan even narrower range, While the helpers in carpentryenjoyed a small real wage increase, other categories in theconstruction sector experienced ne-eligibly marginal chan-9esin their real wages.

When compared with the public sector and formal private

sector, wages in the infbrmal private sector appeared to adjustmore freely to movements in the inflation in a more market

oriented environment, with less volatility exhibited over time.4.4 Population, Labour Force andEmployment

Population

In 2004, the mid-year population estimated by the Re-uistrarGeneral's Department grew by l.l per cent, compared to 1.3per cent recorded in 2003. Accordin_ely, the mid-yearpopulation was 19.5 million in 2004 and almost all districtscontributed to the expansion in population except Mannardistrict where the growth was zero. High increases inpopulation were recorded in Colombo, Kandy, and Ratnapuradistricts, rvhile high grorvth rates were re_qistered fromMullaitivu, Killinochchi and Vavuniya districts. The relativelypeaceful conditions that prevailed in the Northern and Easternprovinces, due to the continuation of the ceasefire since early2002, rvould have enabled more people to return to theirhomes, as indicated by the high population growth recordedfor these three districts in the Northern Province in 2004.

Labour Force

The Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) conducted by theDepartment of Census and Statistics (DCS), which estimatesthe labour force, employment and unemployment in thecountry, cxpanded its sample covera_qe to the entire country byincludin-e the Northem Province during the first half of 2004.The Northern Province was included in QLFS in two sta-ses andas a result, the coverage was extended to the entire country

from the second quarter of 2004. The third quafter labour force

estimates of the QLFS are used to analyse the key variables ofthe labour force in this chapter due to the non-availability of

QLFS data for the fourth quarter of 2004.The labour force, which is defined as persons aged 10years and above, who are able and willing to work, increasedby 0.4 million to 8.0 million in the third quarter of 2004 fromthe third quarter of 2003 mainly due to the inclusion of theNorthem Province in the QLFS during the first half of 2004 .However. the increase in labour force due to the inclusion of

the Northern Province was low compared to the inclusion of the

Eastern Province earlier, where the labour force rose more, byaround 0.5 million. The total labour force consisted of 7.3million employed and 0.7 million unemployed, in the third

ouarter of 2004.

The labour force participation rater , decreased mar_einallyto 47 .8 per cent in the third quarter of 2004 compared to thethird quarter of 2003. This was partly due to relatively lowlabour force participation rates that prevailed in the NorthernProvince. This was further confirmed by the estimates of theConsumer Finances and Socio Economic Survey (CFS-2003/04) conducted by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. The labourforce participation rate of the Northern Province, excludin_qKillinochchi, Mullaitivu and Mannar districts, was low at32.9per cent compared to the overall participation rate of 46.4 percent, according to the CFS-2003104. The decline was seen inboth male and female labour force participation rates. Thegender analysis of the labour force participation rate over theyears had shown that the participation rate of males has beenover twice that of females tluoughout the recent past. This hadnot chan-eed with the inclusion of the North and East.

Employment

The QLFS conducted by the DCS defines an employed person

as one who worked for pay, profit or family gain (unpaid) forone hour or more during the week preceding the survey.Employees temporarily absent from work, due to illness, badweather or labour disputes are also considered as employed.According to the QLFS, the employment rate, which decreasedbetween the first and second quafters of 2004 partly due to theinclusion of three districts of the Northern Province, reversedits direction to 91.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2004.

Althou-eh there was a marginal decrease in the employment ratebetween the third quarters of 2003 and2004, the employmentincreased by .32 million persons.The increase in employment in the ref'erence period wasmainly due to the increase in employment in the Servicessector, while the Agriculture and Industry sectors alsocontributed at a lower rate. As a result, the employment share

1 The ratio of the labour force lo the household popula tion aged 1 0 years andabove.

of the Services sector increased and the shares of the other two

sectors decreased in the third quarter of 2004 compared to thethird quarter of 2003. The employment growth in the Services

sector coincides with the highest sectoral GDP growth recordedby the same for the reference period, while the contraction inGDP in the Agricultural sector and marginal increase inemployment in the same sector, indicates a decline in labourproductivity in that sector.According to the QLFS estimates for the third quarter of2004, only the private sector share of employees increased

amon.q the five cate-qories of employment status, while the

share of unpaid family workers had the hi_uhest decline in thethird quarter of 2004 compared to the third quarter of 2003 .

However the share of public sector employment estimated by

the QLFS for the fourth quarter of 2004 is expected to rise dueto the graduate recruitment pro-eramme implemented by thegovernment in the same period.By implementing the programme, the government

expected to strengthen the public sector through improvementin the quality of the service provided by recruiting a new work

force with higher academic qualitications. At the same time,

they also expected to enhance employment opportunities for

the unemployed graduates in the country. In order to effect therecruitments, the government had to cancel ManagementCircular No. l6(l) dated 24 October 2002 that directed the

downsizing of the public sector in the country. Accordingly,

about 42,000 -uraduates were provided training opportunities in

the government sector with a view to absorbing them into the

service once the training is successfully completed. In addition,

the 1.640 clerical grade appointments made by the Department

of Public Administration also led to the expansion of the public

sector. However, the suspension of recruitments to posts in all

subordinate and minor employee grades remained unchanged

in order to avoid unnecessary postings to the public sector thatwould lead to productivity deterioration.

The expansion in the public sector during the fourthquarter of 2004 was reflected in the Annual Public Sector

Employment Survey (APSES) conducted by the Central Bank.According to the APSES the number of employees ingovernment institutions, which cover central government,provincial government and local government employees,

increased by 7.1 per cent in 2004 compared to the previous

year. In contrast, the number of employees in the governmentsector had declined by 0.6 per cent in 2003, due to the

previous government policy of down sizing the public sector

since 2001.The voluntary retirement schemes (VRS) implementedsince 2001 to reduce the excess staff mainly in the semigovernment institutions, was very effective in reducing the

number of employees up to 2004. The phasing out of VRSduring 2004 was clearly reflected in the lower decrease of

employees in the semi-government institutions, by L9 per

cent, in 2004 when compared to the decrease of 5.1 per centin 2003.

Unemployment

The unemployment rate, which rose marginally fiom end 2003

to 8,I per cent in the flrst quarter of 2004 with the inclusion of

the Northern Province, excluding Vauniya, Killinochchi andMullaitivu, increased further to 9.0 per cent in the secondquarter with the extension of the sample covera-qe to the entire

country. The increase in unemployment in the first half of 2004

was partly due to the inclusion of the Northern Province in the

QLFS. This reversed to 8,5 per cent in the third quarter, solely

due to the Services sector employment generation during the

same period.The continuation of youth unemployment, especially

among the more educated, was evident from the QLFS.Accordin-e to the QLFS estimates, the unemployment rate in

the 20 -29 age group had increased to 21.4 per cent in thethird quarter of 2004 fiom 19.6 per cent in the third quarler of

2003, while the high unemployment rates among those with

GCE (O/L) and GCE (A/L) and higher qualifications further

increased to l4.l per cent and 17.3 per cent, respectively, in

the third quafier of 2004. The high unemployment rates among

the educated youth were further confirmed by the estimates of

the CFS-2003/04 conducted by Central Bank of Sri Lanka'According to the CFS-2003/04 the unemployment rates ofpersons with GCE (O/L) and GCE (A/L) and abovequalifications were 13.8 per cent and 18.2 per cent,

respectively, while the overall unemployment rate was 9.0 per

cent. However these rates are expected to decline during thefourth quarter of 2004 due to the pro-erammes thal were

implemented by the -qovernment to recruit educated youth in to

the public sector.

Foreign Employment

Accordin-e to the Sri Lanka Bureau of Forei_en Employment(SLBFE), the registered number of departures for forei_enemployment grew by 2.1per cent in 2004 and stood atZI3,Il4The Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,UAE and Qatar absorbed around 80 per cent of the totalmigrant labour in 2004. Even though, the first half of 2004indicated a sharp increase of around 9 per cent over the firsthalf of 2003, the projected total number of foreign employmentplacements of 220,600 was not achieved in 2004. Theimprovements made by the SLBFE in2004 to the registerin-q

system for migrant workers at the time of departure improvedthe accuracy of records of the number of departures, therebyincreasing the total reponed departures to a certain degree.The SLBFE reported that the share of females in totalforeign depafiures decreased marginally, However, the shareof females remained above 60 per cent in 2004 and was due tothe increase in the share of housemaids among manpowercategories to 52per cent in 2004 from 49 per cent in 2003.

declining trend in the share of housemaids recorded since 2001was reversed in 2004. This further confirmed that mi-erantworkers continue to consist mostly of blue-collar workers suchas housemaids who are from the lower income groups.

Acceptance of housemaid oft'ers, despite the unsettled post-warsituation in the Middle East in addition to the problems facedby housemaids, ran-ein_q from harassment to death, indicatestheir expectation of better economic opportunities thet e than inthe domestic economy.The decrease in the share of skilled categories amongmanpower categories in 2004 was the opposite of what thecountry had expected to achieve, as skilled migrants always had

the edge over others and were greatly in demand in the foreignjob market. Sri Lanka continues to remain less competitive inthe skilled category of the foreign job market and has been lesssuccessful in catering to the demand for skilled migrants evenwith a system of vocational training institutes in place. In orderto address this problem, a project was initiated by the Tertiaryand Vocational Education Commission (TVEC) with donorfunding to re-organise and develop the tertiary educationsystem in Sri Lanka ln 2004. An awareness programme toconvey existing opportunities in the field and change thenegative social attitudes towards employment in various tradesis a part of this project.

Labour Productivity

Labour productivity, estimated on the basis of annual value

added per employee remained around Rs. 135,000 per personfor the period 2000 to 2004.Labour productivity in the Servicessector was the highest at about Rs. 170,000 per person.Meanwhile, productivity in the Agriculture sector was less thanhalf that in the other two sectors. Therefore, it reduced theoverall productivity level to well below the Services and

Industry sector levels. The mar-einal increase in the overallproductivity observed since 2002 was solely due to the

increasing trend in Services sector productivity.

4.5 Policies and lssues

Despite the GDP growth of 5.4 per cent in 2004, and relatively

stable unemployment rates, the rising inflationary trend is a

cause for concern for macro economic stability. Signs of risingintlation could fuel further inflation and raise inflationaryexpectations leading towards an inflation - wage increase

spiral, Hence, remedial measures need to be taken urgently to

anest this trend.

Comparison of nominal wage movements in the informal

private sector and the other two sectors, public sector and formalprivate sector, sug-eests that nominal wages in this sector adjustfairly, in line with the changing cost of livin-{ and productivity,

whereas administered wa-ee revisions at ad-hoc intervals in theother two sectors could result in unwarranted real wa-{e

increases without commensurate productivity improvementswhich could increase cost-push inflationary pressure. Hence,effective measures are required to ensure productivity

improvements to follow any increase in real wa-qes.It has been acknowled-eed by successive governmentsthat labour market reforms are necessary to ensure anefficient allocation of resources, productivity improvementsand higher participation in the labour market through

improvements in flexibility and a beneficial environment forboth employers and employees. Such changes in the labourmarket are also necessary for achievin-e sustainable hi-eh

economic growth and securin-s international competitiveness.However, a lack of policy consistency has resulted in an

uncertain environment, which seems to be more harmful thannot having reforms at all, both in terms of labour costs and

labour productivity. Since delayin-e necessary refbrms would

a-qgravate the situation further, all stakeholders need to work

together to make such reforms a reality towards removingexisting labour market ri-eidities that hamper long term

economic development.The low productivity level in the agriculture sector,reflects the weak dynamism in the sector due to deep-rootedstructural weaknesses. This raises concern, as agriculture still

absorbs almost 35 per cent of the total labour force. The ad-hocpolicies followed in the past, includin-9 restrictions in the landmarket and the continuation of distortionery government

interventions, have worsened the situation. Therefore, effectiveresolutions to these weaknesses through a market based

sustainable strate-qy are needed to improve both agriculturalproduction and fhctor productivity in the sector.The mismatch between labour demand and supply in both

domestic and foreign labour markets has been identified as amajor issue in Sri Lanka. According to JobsNet, which was

established to provide a user-friendly interface between job

seekers and potential employers, there were around 13,000unfilled vacancies mostly in the craft and related trades sector,despite around 101,000 people being registered with the

JobsNet. Also, according to the SLBFE, the demand for skilledlabourers in the construction sector, welders and drivers in theforeign labour market, especially in the Middle East, was notfulfilled due to the short supply of such skilled labourers. The

mismatch remains despite some education reforms undertakento match the demand and the skills training provided byinstitutions such as the TVEC to meet the demand for skilledworkers. In order to minimise the mismatch, educationalreformists, planners of trainin,e programmes and job seekersshould be provided with near-perfect information about

occupations in demand. Conducting occupational surveys onkey skills, abilities and wage levels currently in place for keyoccupational sectors in the economy will help to make suchinformation available to job seekers and minimise theinformation gap between demand and supply in the labourmarket.
