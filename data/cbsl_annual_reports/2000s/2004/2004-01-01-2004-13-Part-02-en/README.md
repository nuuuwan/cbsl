MODERNISATION OF THE CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA

L. Introduction

The ever-occurring complexities in financial markets andnew thinking on both the economic poiicy and the role ofcentral banks in a changiug world have necessitated theccntral banks rvorld-over to change themselves in order tobuild capacity to perform effectively. The Central Bank ofSri Lanka (CBSL). established in 1950, had gone through

changes fronr time to time , but the need for a comprehensivemodernisation rvas more urgently felt after the Bankcommerrced the rebuilding Frocess foilcwing the bomb

e xplosiori of 1996. During this phase, the Bank was able toperfrrrm all its functions crffectively without any disruptionto its operutions, rvith limited staff and office space. Thisconfirmerl the earlier realisation that the Bank could functioneff'ectivell v;ith a- iesser number cf stafi by refocussingon its core functions. The modernisation programme wasin-house developed by the staff of the Bank who met forthis purpose in several retreats durins t998 - 2000. Finally,it got started fbrmally in 2001.

(6) Financial Assets and Liabilities

The Bank presents financial assets and liabilities, and theassociated income and expense streams, by distinguishing

between foreign currency and local currency activities. Foreigncurrency activities mainly arise from the Bank's foreign

reserv es management function.

The Bank considers that

the combined reporting of foreign and local currency activitieswould weaken the informational value of the I'inancial

statements.All investments are initially recognised at cost, being thefair value of the consideration given and including acquisition

charges associated with the investment. After initial recognition,

subsequent measurement bases are described below. All regularway purchases and sales of financial assets (ones that requiredelivery of assets within the time frame generally established

changes.

does not differ materially from their fair value at the balancesheet date.The carrying amounts, of both those revalued and thosemeasured at cost, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to

assess whether they are recorded in excess of their recoverableamount, and if carrying values exceed this recoverable amount,

assets are written down.When an asset is revalued, any increase in the carryingamount is credited directly to a revaluation reserve unless itreverses a previous revaluation decrease relating to the same

asset which was previously recognized as an expense, In thesecircumstances the increase is recognized as income to the extentof the previous write down. When an asset's carrying amountis decreased as a result of a revaluation, the decrease isrecognized as an expense unless it reverses a previousincrement relating to that asset, in which case it is chargedagainst any related revaluation reserve, to the extent that thedecrease does not exceed the amount held in the revaluationreserve in respect of that same asset. Any balance remainingin the revaluation reserve in respect of an asset, is transferreddirectly to retained earnings on retirement or disposal of the

asset.

facilities.. Acting as a depository of the Government underspecific arrangements with Government and agenciesacting on behalf of the Govemment.

The activities carried out in order to achieve its objectiveof economic, price and financial system stability with a viewto encouraging and promoting the development of theproductive resources of Sri Lanka, can be broadly segregatedinto foreign currency and local currency activities.

F oreign Currency Activities

Foreign currency activities result mainly from the Central Bankof Sri Lanka's holdings of foreign currency assets under itsforeign reserves management function. The foreign reserves

management portfoli<l comprises foreign curency assets heldfor foreign exchange intervention purposes ("foreign reserves")and other foreign currency assets held for trading purposes.The foreign currency assets are held in various cunencies.The majority are denominated in United States dollars, Euros,Sterling pounds and Japanese yen. The financial instrumentsheld within these fbreign currency portfolios consist mainly ofsovereign securities, securities held under reverse repurchasetransactions or balances held with other central banks.commercial banks and settlement institutions.The Central Bank of Sri Lanka also holds, fromtime-to-time, foreign currency assets and liabilities that arisefrom domestic market operations.

Local Curcency Activities

Local currency activities arise as follows:(t) Liquidity mana-qement operations: Liquidity management

largely involves the Central Bank of Sri Lanka offsettingthe daily net flows to or from government or market by

advancing funds to or withdrawing funds tiom the banking

system. Most of this business is undertaken through daily

open market operations.(rt) Holding an investment portfolio comprising Sri Lankagovernment secuntres to support the liability fbr currencyin circulation and representing the investment of the

Central Bank of Sri Lanka's net equity. The Bank's policy

is to hold these investments for open market operations.

Bank Supervision

The regulatory and supervisory function of the Central Bankrelating to banks licensed by the Monetary Board of the CentralBank is carried out by the Bank Supervision Department(BSD), with a view to ensuring the safety and soundness of thebanking system and safeguarding the interests of depositors. As

at end of 2004, 36 licensed banks, i.e.,22licensed commercialbanks (LCB) and 14 licensed specialised banks (LSB), werein operations under the supervision of the Central Bank. Theoperations of the BSD in 2004 mainly included the following:

(a) Issue of Prudential Regulations

The BSD issued several prudential regulations and guidelinesto the licensed banks in 2004 covering the areas of capital

adequacy ratios, credit ratings, extemal auditors, statutory liquidassets ratio, professional valuation reports on property

mortga,red to banks, single bonower limit, classification of badand doubtful debts, shipping guarantees issued by banks,withdrawal from savings accounts and accounting for properties

acquired by foreclosure of collateral as part settlement of debts.

These regulations and guidelines appear in detail in another partof this report.

(b) Approvals for Banks, Branches andOther Banking Outlets

During the year 2004, the BSD continued to process requestsmade by LCBs and LSBs for approval for the opening andrelocation of branches in terms of the Banking Act. During the

year, approvals granted in this regard included 22new branches,relocation of 50 branches, 20 new other banking outlets suchas pay offices, pawning centers and student savings units,l1 relocations and 4 up-grading of such other banking outlets,9 off-site Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and onerelocation of ATM. Accordingly, there were 1,481 branches,970 other banking outlets and 829 ATMs in operations as at

the end of 2004. The settin-{-up of the SME Bank Ltd. as a LSBby the Government in terms of a Budget proposal of 2005 was

approved by the Monetary Board and a license was issued.

(c) Off-Site Surveillance of Licensed Banks

The BSD monitors the financial condition of LCBs and LSBs

on the basis of periodic information provided by the banks ontheir operations. The information gathered is analysed to

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2OO4(XV)

Part llAccounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

ascertain the risk exposure of individual banks and of the

banking system as a whole. It helps in identifying significant

and critical changes in the financial condition of banks and

serves as an early warning system to indicate vulnerabilities of

particular banks or areas that require further investigation andexamination, In order to upgrade the current off-site

surveillance system, a decision was made in 2004 to implement

a new system of on-line central database in the Central Bank

covering the banking industry and registered finance companiesto monitor fully their operations with a view to promoting thestability of the financial system as a whole. In 2004, this

database was at the testing stage.

(d) Statutory On-site Examinations ofLicensed Banks

In terms of the provisions of the Monetary Law Act, all LCBs

are subject to statutory examinations, at least once during each

examination period as determined by the Monetary Board,

which at present is two years. Statutory examinations on LSBs

are conducted in terms of the provisions of the Banking Act.

The BSD has now fully adopted the n,:w approach - the nsk

based examination process, which focisis on identification ofbanking risks, the management of these risks and the

assessment of the adequacy of resources to mitigate these risks.

In 2004, the BSD undertook 31 statutory examinations, which

included 20 examinations that commenced in 2004 and the

completion of l l examinations that commenced in 2003. The

examinations of l0 banks out of 20 that commenced in 2004

were completed and other l0 examinations await completion.

Accordingly, the BSD completed 21 examinations in 20M.

(e) Suspension of Business of PramukaSavings & Development Bank Ltd.(PSDB)

Following the suspension of the business of PSDB in October

2ffi2,theMonetary Board decided to cancel the banking licenseof the PSDB and to issue an order in terms of the provisions

of the Monetary Law Act to the Director of Bank Supervisionto take action to wind up the PSDB. This decision was

conveyed to the PSDB on 18 December 2002. However, in

terms of subsequent judgments of the Court of Appeal and the

Supreme Court on Court cases filed by groups of depositors

and the management of the PSDB challenging the decision of

the Monetary Board, the Central Bank considered further the

options to resume the business of the PSDB in terms of the law,

In this regard, several parties expressed interest in restructurin-e

the PSDB and to resume its business.The Central Bank had discussions with the parties who

furnished proposalVconcept papers in this regard. Messrs. Emst

and Young were appointed as the Central Bank's Consultantsfor this purpose. The Monetary Board considered the proposal

made by the consortium of investors led by Asia Capital Ltd.(Consortium). The Monetary Board was of the opinion that

despite certain concerns, and the fact that the implementationof this proposal involves the fulfillment of several conditionsprecedent, the feasibility of the proposal could not be

completely ruled out. In amving at this decision, the Monetary

Board also took cognizance of the fact that even though the

depositors may finally receive a sizable amount of the capital

of deposits in a liquidation, there were other creditors such as

those who have invested funds in money market bills of the

PSDB who would not have qualified fbr any repayment in aliquidation, as they would not be treated as depositors in aliquidation. Pending the Consortium carrying out a due

diligence to finally determine whether they would undertake

the restructuring of the PSDB to enable it to continue to canyon business, the Monetary Board decided that the PSDB bepermitted to resume limited business with effect from22 January 20M, in terms of Section 30(3) of the MonetaryLaw Act, subject to specified conditions.The Central Bank had several discussions and

conespondence with the Consortium and provided the financialinformation necessary to proceed with the proposal. In the

process, the Consortium revised its proposal three times since

the initial proposal that was submitted on24 December 2003.

The Monetary Board directed the Director of Bank Supervision

to obtain an independent opinion from Messrs. Ernst and Young

on the merits of the proposed settlement of deposits by the

Consortium vis-a-vis the liquidation option. Accordingly, the

Consultants opined that liquidation would be a better option in

the interest of the depositors. An independent evaluation by the

Central Bank also revealed that the depositors would be betteroff under liquidation rather than under the proposal submittedby the Consortium. According to the estimates made by the

Central Bank on the basis of a conservative valuation of the

assets of PSDB, the liquidation could result in the repayment

to 70 per cent of depositors compared to 63 per cent to be repaidby the Consortium over a period of l0 years. Further, theConsortium was requested to obtain the consent of thedepositors and creditors of the PSDB for the proposed

repayment of deposits and debts. However, the Consortiumcould not obtain the consent for 31 per cent of deposits and

debts.Taking into account, inter alia, the above matters, the

Monetary Board decided on 3 August 2004 to suspend the

business of the PSDB in terms of Section 76M(l) of the

Banking Act and to cause the Director of Bank Supervision to

make application to the competent court to wind up PSDB

under Section 30(3) of the Monetary Law Act and to cancel

the banking license of PSDB in terms of Section 30(l0Xb) of

the Monetary Law Act. Accordingly, the Director of Bank

Supervision filed action bearing No.l68/CO in the District

Court of Colombo for the winding-up of PSDB. Subsequent

to the filing of the action for liquidation, a depositor of the

PSDB filed action bearing no. 195512004 in the Court ofAppeal seeking to quash the decision of the Monetary Boardto liquidate the PSDB and to cancel its license. An interim orderwas issued by the Court of Appeal staying the winding upproceedings until the hearing and final determination of theCourt of Appeal application. The Central Bank informed thegeneral public of the above decision of the Monetary Boardwith the relevant details through the print and electronic media.(f) Administration of the Deposit InsuranceScheme

The BSD continued to administer the voluntary Deposit

Insurance Scheme, which commenced operations in 1987. Thisscheme was opened to banking institutions licensed by theCentral Bank and co-operative societies registered under theCo-operative Societies Law, No.5 of 1972, which acceptdeposits. At present, only three Multi-Purpose Co-operativeSocieties have obtained insurance cover under the scheme inrespect of deposit liabilities of their rural banks. The depositinsurance fund consisting of the premium collected andRs.50 million allocated by the Central Bank in 1997 stood atRs.l7l million as at 3l December 2004. These funds have beeninvested in Treasury bills and Treasury bonds of which thevalue has now risen to Rs.l93 million, In addition, the BSDhas submitted a policy paper and had discussions on theproposal for a mandatory deposit insurance scheme whichwould replace the cunent voluntary scheme. The proposal has

been forwarded to the Financial Sector Cluster of the NationalCouncil for Economic Development (NCED) for further

decision.

(g) Meetings with Banking Industry

The BSD arranged the following meetings in 2004i. Monthly meetings of the Governor with Chief ExecutiveOfftcers of Banks: These meetings serve as a forum forexchange of views on issues and policies relating tobanking operations and help to establish a rappofi betweenthe banks and the Central Bank. Some of the major issuesthat were discussed at the meetings included constraintsfaced by customers in obtaining facilities from banks,unauthorized use of international credit cards for network

marketing pyramids and adherence to "know your customerrules", the high intermediation cost of the commercialbanking sector and the need for appropriate action by thebanks to reduce the interest spread, obtaining credit ratingsand the proposal for implementation of the Basel II CapitalAccord. In addition, the CEOs were regularly apprised ofeconomic and monetary developments in the country witha view to providing information useful for making moreinformed business decisions.

ii. Meetings of two Committees on Financial SystemStability and Reformsl. Financial Sector Reforms: The Financial SectorReforms Committee (FSRC) established by the CentralBank in March 2002 to undertake actions necessary toinitiate, coordinate and implement financial sectorreforms had l0 meetings in 2004 until it wasdiscontinued in June 2W4, when the Financial SectorCluster (FSCL) was set up under the National Councilfor Economic Development (NCED) appointed byH.E. the President in June 20A4. Two key objectives of

the FSCL were the formulation of policies to promotefinancial stability and to increase access to finance bylocal entrepreneurs, Small and Medium Enterprises(SlvtEs) and the rural sector. The FSCL, co-chaired bythe Deputy Governor of the Central Bank and DeputySecretary to the Treasury, has I I members. Heads of

Departments of the Central Bank and representatives ofrelevant institutions who are involved in the financialreform process are also invited to attend meetings as andwhen necessary. The FSCL had 8 meetings since its

conrmencement in June 2004.2. Financial Stability Committee: The Financial StabilityCommittee (FSC) of the Central Bank had I I meetingsin2004. The remit of the FSC was the assessing of risksand vulnerabilities leading to major financial systeminstabilities in the country and recommending policiesto promote financial system stability, which is one ofthe two statutory objectives of the Central Bank. As atend of 20M, the FSC consisted of l3 members who are

the Heads of Departments whose functions have a directbearing on hnancial system stability. During the year2004, the FSC was involved in reviewing the firstFinancial Stability Report (FSR), which is to bepublished in due course, preparation of a pamphletseries for public awareness on the financial system,formulation of a proposal for a mandatory depositinsurance scheme as a financial safety net instrument,implementation process for a central database formonitoring on-line information of banks and financecompanies and developing a mechanism for oversightof the payments system, which is crucial to financialstability.

Exhibition organised and conducted by the Departmentof Economics of the Kelaniya University during19 - 2I October 2004.

The Central Bank stall at the above two exhibitions waswell patronised by school children and members of the public.Nearly 7,000 students and members of the public visited theBank's Currency Museum during the year.

Domestic Operations

The Domestic Operations Department continued to perform itsdual function of implementing the Bank's monetary policymainly through Open Market Operations (OMO) and enforcin_eStatutory Reserve Requirement (SRR) and functioning as thebanker to both commercial banks and the government. In

addition, as an ancillary service, the department also providedintra day liquidiry facility (lLF) ro commercial banks andprimary dealers to ensure the smooth functioning of country'selectronic payment and settlement system, code-namedLankaSettle.

1. Implementation of Monetary Policy(i) Open Market Operations (OMO)

OMO was conducted during the year as a palt of the systemof market based monetary policy operations introduced by theBank in 2003tt. Under this system, OMO included severaloperations: (rz) conducting daily auctions either for repurchase(Repo) transactions to absorb excess liquidity or reverserepurchase (reverse Repo) transactions to inject liquidity, ifthere is a shortage of liquidity, on a daily basis (&) provisionsof Repo and Reverse Repo facilities under standing facilitiesand (c) outright sales of Treasury bills or purchases of bothTreasury bills (in the primary and secondary markets) andTreasury bonds (in the secondary market only) at the discretionof the Central Bank to absorb or inject liquidity on a long termbasis. Treasury bills were used as collateral for Repotransactions, while both l'reasury bills and bonds were used forReverse Repo transactions. All commercial banks and primarydealers continued to be participatin,e institutions (pls) under thesystem.With the implementation of the Scripless SecuritiesSettlement System (SSSS) in respect of governmenr papers inFebruary 2004, OMO was also automated and conducted inScripless Government Securities by introducing an interfacelinking OMO Front Office with rhe Back Office andLankaSettle. This has improved the efficiency of operations,while eliminating the nsks involved in dealing in securities inscrip fbrm. Further, an 'On Line Electronic Reporting andMonitoring System for Money Market Operations' wasintroduced in July 2004, which enabled the Cenrral Bank tomonitor on line, the transactions in inter bank money marketand take action if deemed necessary to maintain the stabilityin interest rates.The Repo and reverse Repo rates of the Central Bank atwhich standing facilities were provided to pls remainedunchanged at7 per cent and 8.5 per cent until they were revisedupward by 50 bps to 7.5 per cent and 9.0 per cent respectively,on 12 November 2004.

(a) Repurchase (Repo) TransactionsAuction System

During the year, on average, there was an excess liquidity ofaround Rs.6.6 billion per day. Therefore, auctions for Repotransactions were conducted every working day to absorbexcess liquidity. On average, Rs.5 billion per day was offered

1/ For details see Box Article No. 20 of the Central Bank Annual Report2002.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2OO4(xrx)

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

at the auction and bids were received for the entire amount

auctioned. However, during the most of the second half of the

year, more or less the total estimated excess liquidity was

offered to the auction as emerging macroeconomic conditions

wananted a containment of monetary expansion. Consequently,the weighted average auction rate which remained within a

narrow range of 1.02-7.05 per cent during January - mid May

2004 moved up gradually to 7.41 per cent by l0 November

2004. With the upward revision of the Central Bank Repo and

Reverse Repo rates by 50 bps on 12 November 2004, theauction rate moved up to 7.86 per cent. The auction rateremained at around 7.88 per cent on average during

12 November -24 December 2004. During the balance periodof the year, the amount absorbed through the auction was

reduced substantially to facilitate smooth functioning of moneymarkets and the payment and settlement system under

difficulties caused by the Tsunami disaster.

Standing Facilities

The PIs that were unable to meet their requirements at the

auction resorted to standing facilities at the Repo rate of the

Central Bank. Accordingly, there were Repo transactions to an

average of Rs.2.3 billion per day under standing facilities. This

amounts [o an average of 34 per cent of the total liquidity

absorbed on a day. However, with the absorption of a larger

volume of excess liquidity through the daily auction, the relative

importance of absorption through standing facilities declined

to about 15 per cent during the second half of the year.

Total Volume

The total value of Repo transactions (overnight equivalent),both under the auction system and the standing facilities

decreased from Rs.4,331 billion in 2003 to Rs,2,512 billion in

2004. Almost all of these transactions in 2004 were with PIs

whereas in 2003 internally managed funds of the Central Bank

accounted for about 22 per cent of these transactions. With

effect from 30 January 2004, internally mana-eed tunds have

made their investments through commercialbanks and primary

dealers.

(b) Reverse Repurchase ( Reverse Repo)Transactions

As the market was liquid in 2004, there was no need for the

Central Bank to inject liquidity on a daily basis through

auctions. Despite there being excess liquidity in the market,

there were several days in which a t'ew participants resorted toborrow through Reverse Repo transactions ttnder standing

facilities mainly due to self imposed limits of banks on their

lendin-e to other banks. However, these borrowin-eis were

marginal and did not entail any serious threat to macroeconomic

stability.

(c) Outright Transactions in Government Securities

As the excess liquidity was quite high around Rs.19 billion at

the beginning of the year 20M, an auction as well as direct sales

were conducted to sell Treasury bills outright, out of the Central

Bank holdin-ss to reduce excess liquidity on a long term basis.

The total value of Treasury bills sold through the auction and

direct sales in January 2004 was Rs.2.3 billion. Furlher sales

were not required as the excess liquidity declined with the

maturing of Treasury bills out of the Central Bank holdings and

sales of foreign exchange by the Central Bank'

(ii) Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR)

The Department continued to enforce SRR which remained atl0 per cent of rupee denominated deposit liabilities of

commercial banks.(iii) Bank Rate

The Central Bank's rate of interest (Bank rate) on short term

advances to licensed commercial banks, stipulated under

Section 87 of the Monetary Law Act, remained uncharlged at

15 per cent. However, this rate was inoperative since no bank

resorted to borrow from the Central Bank at the Bank rate'

Functioning as Banker tocommercial banks and Government(i) Accounts of Financial InstitutionsFacilitating the Central Bank to operate as the Bankerto banks, the Department continued to provide cunentaccount facilities to commercial banks and primarydealers to ensure an efficient inter bank payment andsettlement system. These accounts were operated on aReal Time Gross Settlement basis within the automatedgeneral ledger system of the Bank.(ii) GovernmentAccountsFacilitating the Central Bank to serye as the Banker tothe government, the Department continued to maintainaccounts of government departments, government

agencies and institutions and ceftain statutory boards,providing them with required banking facilities. Thetotal number of such accounts maintained by the bankstood at 55 at end 2004. Four new accounts wereopened in 2004 while 70 accounts were closed at therequest of the govemment. In terms of Section 89 ofthe Monetary Law Act, the Bank continued to provideprovisional advances to the government. The limit onsuch advances (10 per cent of the estimatedgovernment revenue) was increased by Rs.2.6 billionto Rs.35.6 billion in 2004. There was no interesrcharged on these advances.

3. Provision of Intra Day Liquidity Facility

The Department continued to provide intra day liquidity facility(ILF), a responsibility which the department assumed in 2003,to commercial banks and primary dealers to ensure smooth andefficient operations of LankaSettle. The discharge of thisresponsibility included prompt dealing with requests ofparticipating institutions for intra day liquidity and theirreversals and promptly charging default interests on those whofailed to settle ILFbefore the close of business of LankaSettleon the sarne day. ILF was continued to be provided free of

char-ee against the collateral of government Treasury bills andbonds. Securities were valued at their current market prices witha sufficient 'hair cut' to cover possible variations in pricesdurin-{ the day.The total value of ILF drawn during the year wasRs.654 billion. This amounted ro ILF drawings of Rs.2.7 billionper day on average, which was lower than the average ofRs.3.2 billion drawn in December 2003. There was only oneoccasion of an ILF default by a participant in 2004, Themeasures in place, including penalty interest at the Bank Rateand the suspension of the facility for repeated defaults hasensured the prompt reversal of ILF before the daily close ofbusiness of LankaSettle.

Economic Research

Research Activities

The Central Bank's primary function of conducting monetarypolicy and associated functions of adding knowledge througheconomic research, dissemination of economic and financialinformation, regular assessment of the state of the economy andadvising the government on economic issues are discharged byits Economic Research Department (ERD). The work involvesnumerous activities relatin,q to economic analysis: at theprimary level, collection and compilation of economic data, atthe secondary ievel, analysis of data for Bank's own policyformulation and at the tertiary level, publishin_{ such analysisfor the benefit of the public.[n2004, while discharging these primary functions, furtherefforts were made by ERD to strengthen the monetary policyformulation framework. In this connection, a vital role wasplayed in facilitating the Monerary Policy Committee (MpC)deliberations every month by providing comprehensiveeconomic analysis and inputs. The monetary policy decisionsof the Bank were disseminated by ERD through press releases,as per a pre-announced calendar.ERD staff continued to undertake research projects, inaddition to research done for preparing policy reports. For thispurpose, ERD obtained the services of Prof, William Branson,Professor of International Affairs of the Princeton University,to conduct several research workshops for the benefit of CentralBank stafT. Under his guidance, ERD staff iniriated l2 researchprojects in 2004. Several studies have been selected forpublication in the Bank's Staff Studies. Staff was also engagedin conducting joint research with international organizations,in particular research projects organized by the SEACENCentre in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. The services of staff ofthe Department were made available for training of postgraduate degree aspirants of the Bank and for providingguidance in their research. A financial programming modelinterlinkin_e all fbur macroeconomic sectors of the economy wasdeveloped for the purpose of analysing policy simulations and

projecting macroeconomic variables under different policy

scenarios. ERD also prepared a report on the impact of the

devastating Tsunami on the economy soon after it occuned andlater prepared analytical documents providing necessary

information for coordinating forei-en assistance granted by theIMF and other donor agencies for relief, rehabilitation and

reconstruction work in Tsunami affected areas.

Policy advice was regularly provided by ERD on various

issues to the Monetary Board and the management, other

departments in the Bank and to government institutions. Many

senior officers in ERD served on various important committees,

both within the Bank and outside. They also served on the

Boards of several institutions, and as resource persons in

training programmes conducted by the Bank's own Centre for

Banking Studies and other foreign and local organizations.

Furlher, ERD continued to provide inputs to and participatedin various committees within the Bank such as the MarketOperations Committee (MOC), the Domestic Debt

Management Committee (DDMC) and the Forei-en Reserves

Management Committee (FRMC).

The primary responsibility of preparing Bank's statutory

reports and other special reports in all three languages lies

mainly with ERD. It coordinated the publication of the Bank's

Annual Report for 2003, and Recent Economic Developments- Highlights of 2004 and Prospects for 2005. In addition, it was

responsible for the preparation of the September l5th Report,

a confidential report submitted by the Bank to the Minister of

Finance prior to the preparation of the government budget.It also continued to improve and expand the dissemination

of information, while making available infbrmation through its

statutory publications, weekly and monthly selected economic

indicators, CBSL website, and through'press releases. The

CBSL website was updated daily by ERD.

ERD also continued to promote relationships with other

intemational organizations. It coordinated Sri Lanka's relationswith the IMF, the inter governmental Group of Twenty Four(G-24), the SEACEN centre for research and training, theSEANZA group and the SAARCFINANCE grouping of

Central Bank Govemors and Finance Secretaries. In 20M, ERD

assisted the Ministry of Finance to coordinate the work with

the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and othermultilateral and bilateral donors. CBSL hosted the 39th

SEACEN Govemors' Conference and 23rd Board of Governors

Meeting in February 2004. ERD was primarily responsible for

organizing the conference and the meeting. In 2004, ERD

completed preparatory work of SEACEN Executive Committee

meeting (EXCO meeting) held in January 2005. ERD continued

to host the SAARCFINANCE Cell of Sri Lanka, a mechanism

for all SAARC countties to exchange staff', share experiences

and learn from each other.

Employees' Provident Fund

The Monetary Board, as the custodian of EPF, continued to

discharge its responsibilities, in terms of the EPF Act, ofreceiving contributions, surcharges, and income frominvestments, maintaining proper accounts of registered

empioyments, members and the Fund, investing of excess

monies in suitable investments, and paying benefits to the

members of the Fund. These activities were carried out with

the close co-ordination of the EPF Division of the Departmentof Labour.

System Modifications

Moving forward with the modernization programme, several

modifications to the EPF IT system were introduced during2004. The collection of member contributions through

electronic media was further expanded with more than 200

large-scale employers opting for this method during 2004. The

introduction of a computerized "Refund Workflow System"

enabled the EPF to improve the efficiency and the accuracy of

the refund process.

Public Awareness and Member Disclosure

An awareness programme initiated in the previous years

continued in 2004 focusing all stakeholders of the Fund. It

covered their rights and responsibilities pertaining to EPF,

correct procedures to be followed, and the significance of EPFfor the membets' well-being after retirement. The Help Desk

of EPF, which was set up in 2003, attended to member inquiries

promptly. In addition to conducting mobile service counters at

various locations in the country, a special mobile service was

initiated in 2004 targeting the estate sector. In this programme,

the four key stakeholders - member, employer, Department of

Labour and Central Bank meet at the employer's premises and

clear up the discrepancies real-time. These events helped to

make an eft'ective outreach of members in remote areas and

thereby givin-e them an opportunity to have their problems

resolved instantaneously. The production of a documentary film

on EPF and participation in several television programmes

during 20M were effective tools used by the Fund for its public

awareness campaign.

Capacity building in the EPF

Skills development of the staff is a major component in the

modernization agenda of the Fund. In line with the Central

Bank's philosophy of establishing a "Leaming Organization",

continuous learning and knowledge sharing were promotedwithin the Fund, An environment to practice the acquired

knowledge was also provided. Officers were trained in the areas

relevant to existing duties and responsibilities and in the areas

of their career path. A key element of the capacity building was

the two-year comprehensive training in tund management,

( xxII )Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2004

Part llAccounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

which was instituted in November 2003 with l4 youngprofessionals. This programme was successfully carried outduring the year under review. These capacity-building activitieswould enrich the Fund with necessary competent humanresources for its modernization activities and to be competitivein a rapidly changing environment.

Housing Loan Facilities

The housing loan scheme which was introduced in 1988continued during the year under review too. Under this scheme,

an EPF member could obtain a loan for housing purposes from

an approved lending institution, pledging the member's balanceup to a maximum of 75 per cent. A second loan was alsoavailable upon the successful settlement of the first. During2ffi4,EPF issued 14,307 member balance certifications relevantto a total approved amount of Rs.2,452 million to lendinginstitutions.The apparent feature is the increasing tendency ofmembers to default in paying the loan instalments to the lendinginstitutions, thereby, misusing the facility as a means ofpremature withdrawal of their EPF balances.

Investment Activities and Returns

During the year, the total investment portfolio of the Fund grewby 12.3 per cent, recording a cost value of Rs.359 billion as at

end 2004. Sustaining the last 7-year trend, the total investmentsof the Fund in Treasury bonds - a long-term market orientedinvestment instrument, further expanded to a level of 77 percent of the total investment portfolio as at end 2004, as against56 per cent in the previous year. Correspondingly, the share of

Fund, though limited, under a prudent investment approach.The rate of return of the EPF's total investment portfoliocontinued to be highly sensitive to the yields on government

securities with 98.2 per cent of the total portfolio being investedin government securities as at end 20M. One-year Treasurybills traded in the primary market in a range of 7 per cent - 8per cent durin,e the year. Accordingly, due to the impact of thelast three-year downturn in the government securities rates(Chart II - 4), the rate of return on the average investmentportfolio of the EPF in 2004 declined to 11.56 per cent from13,68 per cent in the previous year.

Total Member Balance and Rate of Interestfor 2004

The total memberbalance of EPF marked a growth of ll.8 per

cent to a value of Rs.373 billion as at end 2004 after accountingfor the declared interest rate of 9.5 per cent for 2004. In

accordance with the statutory requir:ment of the Fund of

declaring the rate of interest at the ye;ri';nd member balance,

this budgeted interest rate turns out to be an effective rate of

9.59 per cent yielding a realeffective rate of 1.99 per cent over

7.09 per cent, the EPF's effective rate yields a positive margin

of 2.5 per cent to members in 2004.

Outsourcing of Activities

EPF continued with its cost reducing method by outsourcing

of services. Functions to be outsourced are recognized carefully

after a cost-benefit analysis. It takes in to account all the explicit

and implicit costs and benefits, which would incur in the short

run as well as in the long run. It considers all possible nsks

and quality improvements in service to members. Outsourcing

was a major factor, which enabled the Fund to manage its

Recunent Expenditure to Gross Income ratio at a level less thanI per cent, even though the volume of work had increasedduring the recent past. Maintaining the ratio of Recurrent

Expenditure to Gross Income at this extremely competitive

level would be a challenge in the future under a scenario of

falling market interest rates, increasing volume of work and

inflationary pressure, thus making cost reducing methods more

attractive. The ultimate aim of these cost minimization and

quality improvement efforts is the delivery of a maximum

benefit to the EPF members. The salient features of the EPF

are presented in the Table II-8.

TABLE II - 8EPF : The Salient Featuresnetwork-marketing scheme that operatedviathe Internet in the

absence of a preventive legal framework. ECD after conductinga comprehensive investigation into the scheme and relatedactivities of its local promoters, imposed penalties to the extentof US dollars 88 million on those who used their Elestronic

Fund Transfer Cards (EFTC$ in violation of Exchange Controlregulations in making payments to the scheme. At the sametime, the Central Bank carried out a public awarenessprogralnme to educate the public of the dangers of participating

in pyramidal network marketing schemes and its consequencesto the economy in general and the financial sector in particular.The Department also proceeded to strengthen itssupervisory and monitoring activities during the year underreview in view of large-sbale abuses of credit cards for makingpayments to the above scheme. Action was also taken toeducate EFTC holders through card issuing banks of thepermitted uses of their cards; and, the Exchange Controloffences they might be committing when making foreignexchange payments for unauthorized purposes. Anotherdevelopment of the monitoring activities of the year was thecollection of data on the utilization of export proceeds on aquarterly basis.In the area of enforcement of the provisions of the ECA,the dismissal by the Court of Appeal of applications filed bytwo directors of a reputed company to set aside penaltiesimposed on them by the Department was a significantdevelopment. ECD imposed penalties on these persons foroffences committed by them for transferring shares of the

company to non residents in contravention of Section 11(2) ofthe Exchange Control Act. During the year under review theAttorney General's Department filed 8 more iudictments in theHigh Court of Colombo for prosecution of several persons

based on investigations conducted by the Department onmassive foreign exchange frauds.

2. Capital Transactions(a) lnvestments

During the year 2004, the existing Exchange Controlregulations relating to investments in Sri Lanka

remained unchanged. The Hon. Minister of Financepermitted 13 cases of investments abroad in 2004 onrecommendations made by ECD amounting toUS dollars 5.8 million. These were in areas ofmanufacture and marketing of coir products,promoting of Sri Lankan exports and hospital services.(b) Foreign Currency Borrowings

Exchange Gontrol

The management and regulation of receipts and payments offoreign exchange into and out of the country is the key functionof theâ‚¬xchange Control Department (ECD). In the year 2004,all foreign exchange payments and receipts relating to current

transactions continued to be freely released through commercialbanks appointed as authorised dealers (ADD) in foreignexchange at their own discretion subject to exercising duediligence. In addition to authorised dealers, money changers,tourist hotels, travel agencies, and duty free shops continuedto deal in foreign exchange for specific purposes such asexchanging and accepting foreign currency notes and issuingforeign exchange in the form of Travellers' Cheques, etc.TheDepartment, in carrying out its regulatory functions, continuedto issue operating instructions and guidelines to authorised

dealers, conduct on-sight and off-sight examination and monitortheir foreign exchange transactions.

L. Major Developments in 2004

One of the major developments in 2004 was action taken byECD under the provisions of the Exchange Control Act (ECA)to stop large scale drain of foreign exchange on a pyramidal

Part llAccounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

were permitted by ECD to borrow from abroad to atotal sum of US dollars 40 million, while Sri Lanka

Telecom was permitted to raise 5 year international

bonds in overseas markets to an extent of US dollars

100 million.

(c) Issue of Bank Guarantees in favour of Non-residents

During the year under review, permission was grantedto a resident company for issuance of corporate

guarantee to the value of US dollars 35 million.

3. Trade Transactions

ECD continued to monitor import of goods for which payments

had been made in advance with a view to ensure their anivalin the country. During the year following changes were made

on procedure relating to trade transactions.(a) Authorized dealers were permitted to sell foreign

exchange upto US dollars 15,000 (of which currencynotes upto a maximum of US dollars 5,000 and

balance in the form of Travellers' Cheques (TCs) or

a bank draft to a registered gem dealer to carry with

him on his person when travelling to Madagascar forthe purpose of purchasing rough gemstones from

Madagascar and importing into Sri Lanka. Thisfacility was later extended to registered gem dealersfor payment in advance for the import of roughgemstones from Myanmar. These facilities weregranted to assist the development of gem andjewellery industry in the country.(b) Another major change in the area of trade transactionsin 20M was the amendment to the regulations made

under Import and Export (Control) Act published in

the Gazette No. 102?6 of 8 April 1998 in respect ofpayment terms for imports, The amendment was

effected by a regulation made under the same Act

published under Cazette No. 1363/27 of 2l October

2003 restricting imports of almost all motor vehicleson Letters of Credit (LCs) subject to terms andconditions stipulated by the Central Bank of SriLanka. Accordingly, in terms of the Monetary Law

Act, the Central Bank imposed a condition stipulating

a margin of 100 per cent to be deposited with the LC

opening bank at the time such LCs are opened in

respect of certain categories of vehicles.

4. Registration of Freight Forwarders andIssue of Permits to engage in ForeignExchange Transactions

ECD continued to register freight forwarders, grant travel

agencies the authority to issue Travellers' Cheques and issue

licenses to money changers and other establishments such as

hotels, duty free shops, travel agencies etc. to accept foreign

cuffency.

Registration of Freight Forwarders

During the year 2004,5 new companies were registered asfreight forwarders, bringing the total number of companies

registered as freight forwarders to 13l at the end of the year.

ECD continued to monitor credits and debits made to the Rupee

accounts maintained by shipping and airline agents as well asfreight forwarders on behalf of their foreign principals/agents

during the year.

Issue of licenses to Money Changers

ECD issued 08 new money changing licenses to companies thatfulfilled the criteria laid down by the Monetary Board in 1999for the issuances of such licenses. This brought to the numberof money changing companies operated in the year 2004 to 47 .Their total foreign currency purchases, which were

subsequently tendered to authorised dealers, amounted to USdollars 180 million in 2004.

Monitoring

The restrictions-free current account transactions regime that

started in 1994 continued in 2004 as well. As in the past, all

authorised dealers and approved travel agents are required to

report to ECD their sales and purchases of foreign exchangeon regular basis for monitoring purposes. Foreign exchange

sales over US dollars 5,000 per person are required to be

reported daily while sales less than US dollan 5,000 per person

are to be reported on weekly basis. In the case of foreign

exchange releases through Electronic Fund Transfer Cards

(EFTCs), card issuing banks are required to provide detailed

monthly reports on EFTCS where monthly cumulative foreign

exchange expenditure per person exceeds US dollus 5,000 per

month. Releases of foreign exchange are monitored with a viewto detect unauthorised capital transfers; and, funds linked to

frnancing of tenorism or money laundering activities.At present only the head offices and few outstation

branches of commercial banks are electronically linked to ECDfor the transmission of data on their foreign exchange

transactions. During the year 20A4, the Department had a series

of discussions with the officials of IT Departments of the banksfor the formulation of a mechanism to include outstation

branches of all commercial banks into this data transmission

network. Once this is accomplished, monitoring activities of

the Department could be speeded up and used more effectively

for early detection of any abuses on the part of the dealers aswell as the users of Foreign exchange.

Investigations

ECD continued with investigations into alleged violation of theprovisions of the Exchange Control Act. Total of 310 cases

were investigated during the year and, penalties amounting to

Rs.9l.9 million were imposed on persons accused of violating

( xxvr )Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report -2004

Part llAccounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

the provisions of the Act. Among the cases investigated by theDepartment was an investigation into a pyramidal network

marketing scheme where a large number of Sri Lankans had

made payments in foreign exchange on their credit cards forparticipation in the scheme. The investigation revealed thatmany cardholders had used their cards to make foreign

exchange payments to enable third parties to join the said

scheme. Investigations into foreign exchange payments madeby 150 such cardholders were also canied out during the year20M.

Information

The Information Department of the Central Bank is responsible

for providing information on macroeconomic, Banking, Financeand Socio Economic developments with a high degree ofaccuracy and reliability within the Bank, among financial

lnternational Operations

Report on Activities During 2004I. Foreign Exchange Reserve Management

International Operations Department (IOD) manages the officialintemational reserves of the country and monitors the exchangerate movements, while providing management information onintemational and domestic foreign exchange market to facilitatepolicy making. In terms of the Monetary Law Act, the CentralBank should maintain an adequate international reserve inliquid curencies and a nuclear reserye in gold, among its assets,in order to maintain the international stability of the Sri Lanka

rupee and to ilssure the greatest possible freedom of its cunentinternational transactions.In order to add value to the foreign exchange reserves,IOD invests these reserves in the international money andcapital markets. It is canied out with utmost care throughapproved counterparties within the limits authorized by the

management, paying due consideration to safety, liquidity and

the retum on such assets as it manages the wealth of the nation.A major part of the international reserve is invested in fixedincome securities. The balance in money market instrumentsnamely fixed deposits, call deposits and in gold. Currentaccounts with overseas banks (with overnight investmentfacilities) are maintained for day-to-day requirements.In the discharge of its duties, IOD reviews the changes ininterest rates and exchange rates among major cunencies andunderlying factors regularly. The main currencies in which the

reserve was held during 2004, were euros, sterling pounds andUS dollars. Appropriate changes to the composition wereintroduced from time to time taking into account the emergingdevelopments in world's financial markets. Further, IODcontinues to maintain a small portion in other convertiblecurrencies in the assets portfolio as a part of its riskdiversification strategy, whilst maximising returns. The Bank's

debt service requirements and the income generating capacityof the currencies and securities were also considered indetermining the cunency composition. The total net foreignincome generated through the foreign exchange reserve

management operations during 2004 was US dollars 77 million

or Rs,7.8 billion, This was an increase of US dollars 9.5 millionor Rs.960 million over the earnings from this source in 2003.This was mainly due to the adjustment in the currencydistribution of the foreign assets portfolio and comparatively

better prices of fixed income securities.The main risks associated with the Bank's investments of

the official foreign exchange reserve are market risk (foreign

exchange rate risk and interest rate risk), credit risk, liquidity

risk and operational risk. Measures were introduced to mitigateall these risks.Foreign exchange rate risk is the risk of capital losses asa consequence of fluctuations in exchange rates. The Bank

attempts to limit exchange rate risk by spreading its holdingsof foreign reserve assets among different cunencies and this

currency distribution of the portfolio is reviewed periodically.

Interest rate risk or the exposure of the bank's investments to

movements in interest rate is assessed at portfolio levels in

various currency segments and against an internally constructed

benchmark. The deviations of the investment portfolio from the

internally constructed benchmark are assessed periodically and

compared against the approved levels.To minimize the credit risk, i.e., the risks of lossesresulting from the failure of issuers of securities or counter-parties, IOD uses the Counterpalty Credit Risk Management

System (CCRMS), comprising an extensive limit structure oneligible issuers and counterparties based on counterparty

creditworthiness (assessed on a credit rating based framework).

Credit risk is managed by establishing eligibility requirements,confining exposures to high quality instruments, givingindividual credit risk limits to issuers, counterparties and

hnancial instruments.Liquidity risk is defined as the risk of having to incur

unnecessarily high transaction costs in the event of forcedliquidation of a part of a portfolio. Liquidity risk is managed

by establishing liquidity requirements to financial instrumentsand investing the major part of the international reserve inhighly liquid financial instruments with shorter maturities.

The operational risk originates from human effor, flawed

systems, and inadequate procedures and controls, The banklimits operational risk through a range of measures; segregating

the different functions of transaction processing and monitoring;having a clear decision-making committee charged with thefunction of the management of foreign reserves (Foreign

Reserve Management Committee), building controls into thedealing activities, restricting physical access to differentoperational areas, i.e., middle office and settlement areas;introducing and maintaining automated and manual backupprocedures; enforcing comprehensive guidelines on reserye

management activities and introducing controls and procedures.

II. Monitoring the Domestic Foreign ExchangeMarket Developments

IOD closely monitors the developments in the domestic foreign

exchange market, foreign exchange transactions by commercial

banks and overnight net foreign exchange open positions of

commercial banks in order to ensure smooth functioning of the

domestic foreign exchange market and orderly adjustment of

the exchange rate of the Sri Lanka rupee. It provides exchange

rate of the Sri Lanka rupee on various cunencies to Govemment

Departments and Corporations and other relevant parties on

request.The Sri Lankan rupee stood at 104.6050 per US dollar atthe end of 2004 compared to end December 2003 level ofRs.96.1382 indicating a depreciation of L52 per cent. Giventhe relative strengthening of other major cunencies in theinternational market, the rupee depreciated against these

cunencies as well. The volumes of inter-bank foreign exchange

transactions have increased by L7 per cent or US dollars 632.5

milf ion to US dollars 4,279.5 million in2004 compared to the

volume of US dollars 3.&7.0 million in 2003.

Legal

As in previous years, the Legal Department of the Bank

continued its services in advising the Bank on legal matters,representing the Bank in courts and other legal fora andcontributing to the legal reforms in the banking and financial

sector.In 2004, the Legal Department worked closely with

several departments to prepare amendments to legislation, rules,

regulations and other legal documents. In particular, the Legal

Department prepared amendments to several laws relating tothe financial sector including Local Treasury Bills(Amendment) Act, No.l of 2004 and Registered Stock andSecurities (Amendment) Act, No. 2 of 2004, which were

enacted in 2004 and the Banking (Amendment) Act which was

passed by Parliament in December 2004. Regulations and otherdocumentation for the Real Time Gross Settlement and

Scripless Securities Settlement Systems were also prepared

during 2N4.

The Department was also involved in a project undertakenby the Bank with the technical assistance of the World Bank

and IMF to draft new Central Banking and Banking legislation.A draft Payments and Settlements Systems law, too, wasdrafted in 2004 to address issues relating to payments and

settlements systems.

Management Audit

Oversight of Payments System

The payments system oversight and off-site supervisionfunction performed by PSD focused on benchmarking thenational payments system with applicable international

standards with a view to ensure smooth, safe and efficientoperations. In this exercise, PSD collected informationperiodically from all important payments and settlements

seruice providers of the country and analyzed data to assess the

compliance of such systems with the Ten Core Principles forPayments and Settlements Systems and the Nineteen

Recommendations for Securities Settlernent Systems publlshedby the Committee on Payments and Settlements Systems

(CPSS) of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Under

its oversight function, PSD was able to cover the RTGS system,LankaSecure, retail clearing systems operated by LankaClear,

clearing and settlement of securities transactions done at theColombo Stock Exchange (CSE) by the Central Depository

Systems (Pvt.) Ltd., National Net Settlement System operatedby Bank of Ceylon for clearing Visa card transactions and theMasteCard In tern ati onal Service s for intra-country settlement

operated by Standard Chartered Bank.

Overseeing the activities of LankaClear was strengthenedduring 2004 by drafting and imposing Terms and Conditions

on LankaClear in November,20M. The PSD prepared the first

report on Payment System Stability covering the second halfof 20f,4 to the Financial Stabilitv Committee in earlv Januarv

2005.

Publications

One of the main targets achieved by the PSD during 2004, was

the publishing of the Red Book - Payment Systems in Sri Lankaby BIS. This was prepared jointly by the Central Bank of Sri

Lanka and CPSS of BIS. From the inception of CPSS in 1990,BIS has published the Red Books for 15 countries and Sri

Lanka has become the sixteenth country in the world to publish

its Red Book. In the Asian region, Sri Lanka is the third countryin the line, after Singapore and the Republic of Korea. The

quarterly Payments Bulletin that the PSD has been publishing

since 2001, was continued during 2004. PSD also continuedliaising with international organizations such as the BIS,

SEACEN, World Bank and IMF as well as the central banksof other countries.

Public Awareness on the Payment System

With the objective of increasing the awareness of general publicon payments system and promoting their usage of developed

payment instruments, the PSD initiated several measures during

2004:

PSD initiated action to extend the time of acceptanceof third party transaclons by commercial banks till

10.45 a.m. from the beginning of 2005 to enable theparticipation of more third party customers;

. The PSD also launched an awareness program of theRTGS system for the corporate clients of large

commercial banks; and. Several rounds of discussions were held with officers

of the govemment revenue collection departments such

as Inland Revenue. Customs and Excise.

Premises

The Premises Department continued to carry out the

maintenance and upkeep of the Bank's premises during 20f,4,in addition to providing support services such as transport and

communication facilities to officers of the Bank.

Most of the maintenance work and a part of the transport

services have been outsourced with a view to obtaining services

more efficiently and at a lower cost. Through improvements

introduced to Bank's Energy Management Systems, the costof consumption of electricity and of air conditioning werereduced. During the year 2004, the Premises Department

installed an advanced fire Suppression System at the computerroom and the Bank's disaster recovery site.

Public Debt

The achievements made in public debt management and debt

market development in 2003 were further consolidated during

2004. The introduction of the Scripless Securities Settlement

System (SSSS) and the Central Depository System (CDS) in

early 20M was a milestone in the debt market development inSri Lanka. This technological advancement in the debt marketinfrastructure intends to improve the efficiency of the

government securities market and enhance secondary markettrading by generating liquidity, reducing the risks associatedwith paper based securities, and finally reducing cost of

transactions and cost of borrowing to the government. Further

phasing out of the Rupee loan progralrrms, early retirement ofhigh cost callable rupee loans, strengthening the legal,institutional, and market framework for issue and trading ofscripless securities, initiatives taken in respect of capital

adequacy framework for Primary Dealers (PDs) are some of

the key developments in debt management during 2W4.

As per section I l3 of MLA, the Monetary Board and the.

Central Bank are vested with the function of debt management.Accordingly, as the agent of the government, the Public Debt

Department (PDD) raises resources from the domestic marketto meet the budgetary requirements and services both foreign

and domestic debt. fiie main objective of the PDD is to managethe government debt to ensure that financing needs of the

government and its payment obligations are met at the lowestpossible cost consistent with a prudent degree of risk. An

appropriate strategy to achieve these objectives is designed at

the Domestic Debt Management Committee (DDMC), which

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2004( xxxm )

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

consists of members from the Ministry of Finance and theCentral Bank ensuring effective coordination betweenmonetary, fiscal and debt management policies.

Developments in 2004

Debt Issuance and cost

In terms of the Appropriation Act, No.44 of 2003 approved by

the Parliament for 2W4, the total gross bonowing limit of thegovernment amounted to Rs.350 billion out of which a sum ofRs.250 billion was to be raised from the domestic securitiesprogramme, and PDD, through its well planned bonowingprogramme, raised Rs.242 billion from domestic sources tofulfil the budgetary needs. Further, the total authorised limit ofTreasury bills under the Local Treasury'Bills Ordinance was

increased from Rs,250 billion to Rs,300 billion in December,2004 considering the future bonowing requirements of the

government.In line with the strategy adopted to increase reliance ontradable instruments, the bulk of the resource requirement for2004 was raised through Treasury bills, Treasury bonds andDevelopment bonds. In 2004, PDD conducted 53 Treasury billauctions. The total amount accepted at these auctions wasRs.304,593 million out of bids amounting to Rs.657,702million. During the year, issue of Treasury bills, in all maturities(91 day, 182 day, 364 day and other), amounted to Rs.469,973million, while repayments in all maturities amounted to

Rs.445,382 million resulting in Rs.24,591 million net new issueof Treasury bills. Reflecting the market preference towatds

short term bills of the total gross issues, 42 per cent was on 9lday Treasury bills.The number of Treasury bond auctions held in 2004 was33 and in view of further facilitating the trading in thesecondary market by way of developing some benchmark

securities, the number of series of Treasury bonds issued during

the year was further reduced to 78 from 92 in20f,.3. The totalamount of bids received at the Treasury bond auctions wasRs.136,218 million of which Rs.54,336 million was accepted.The total issues of Treasury bonds during the year amountedto Rs.217,198 million, of which 70.3 per cent was issued for

2 yeu and 3 year maturities. The repayments of Treasury bonds

amounted to Rs.56,956 million resulting in Rs.160,242 million

of net new issue of Treasury bonds during the year. Due to themarket appetite leaning towards shorter end of the long termTreasury bond market, issues of 9 and 6 year maturities werelimited ro Rs.23,400 million.

The issue of Rupee loans in 2004 amounted to a meagreamount of Rs.564 million. In addition to the compulsory

repayments of Rs.24,519 million, in view of reducing the costof the existing debt, action has been taken to retire callableRupee loans amounting to Rs.59,700 million which carriedinterest rates of 11.25 - 13 per cent. Consequently, the netrepayment was Rs.83,655 million in respect of Rupee Loans.

In conformity with the debt management strategy, the share of

non-tradable securities in the domestic debt stock declined from25 per cent in 2003 to 15 per cent in 2004.The issue of Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs)during 2004, under Foreign Loans Act, No. 29 of 1957amounted to Rs.25,705 million, while repayments were at

Debt Market Development

Scripless Securities Settlement System (SSSS) and theCentral Depository System (CDS) (LankaSecure)

A pioneering step taken by the Central Bank in 2004 in the

sphere of debt market development was the implementation ofa Scripless Securities Settlement System (SSSS) andintroduction of a Central Depository System (CDS) for Sri

Lankan govemment securities market. The issuance of Treasurybills and Treasury bonds in scripless form was commenced onthe 30th Jaruary 2004. The CDS facilitated recording of

transactions of government securities to the level of beneficial

owners of such securities. With the commencement of issuing

scripless securities a procedure was also adopted to convert

Treasury bills and Treasury bonds which were in scrip forminto scripless form. By the middle of February 2005 all

outstanding Treasury bills will be in scripless form.In the area of technological developments, PDD took

action to modify the electronic bidding system to be compatiblewith the SSSS. It has also been introduced several new

electronic interfaces for transferring auction results to CDS,handling securities conversion process and printing statementsto be issued to the investors.

Enabling the operations of scripless securities system, the

required legal amendments were made to Registered Stock andSecurities Ordinance (RSSO) and Local Treasury billsOrdinance (LTBO). In addition, system rules, procedures,

directions and guidelines required for the smooth functioningof the system were issued during the year to the participantsof "LankaSecure".

The value of Scripless Securities issued during the yearamounted to Rs.436,965 million of Treasury bills andRs.225,667 million of Treasury bonds. The system made

Other Market development activities

The Central Depository System of the Colombo StockExchange (CSE) was given a direct participant status in theScripless Securities Settlement System and the Real Time GrossSettlement System to trade the beneficial interest in government

securities.

Regulation and supervision of the PrimaryDealer System

With the commencement of operations by NatWealth SecuritiesLtd., the Primary Dealer (PD) network was further expandedto 12 PDs. During the year, PDD continued to supervise PDsadopting onsite and offsite examinations, spot examinations,one-on-one discussions, risk analysing techniques, etc. In viewof the volatile market conditions that prevailed during the firstseven months of the year, there was an erosion in the capital

base of the PDs. Hence, PDD took timely and conective actionto restructure their capital base and strengthen the stability ofthe industry. In order to counteract high market volatility, adirection was issued to prevent short selling by PDs withoutactually holding the relevant securities in its portfolio.

sales/purchases and Repos/Reverse Repos) in Treasury bills andTreasury bonds where a Primary Dealer is a party to transactionamounted to Rs.4,135.5 billion recording a decline of 10.5 percent compared with the previous year. The decline was mainlydue to the drop in Repo transactions in Treasury bills by74.6 per cent and the drop in outright sales/purchases ofTreasury bonds transactions by approximately 50 per cent.It has been observed that the Primary Dealers havechanged their risk appetite to a risk aversion position leadingto an increase in short end market transactions such as overnightReverse Repos in the secondary market.Overnight Reverse Repos by PDs on account of Treasurybonds rose by more than two and a half times, while on accountof Treasury bills it increased by 20 per cent during 2004compared with the previous year.The total outright sales of Treasury bills amounted toRs.317,025 million, whereas the outright purchases amountedto Rs.72,693 million.

micro-irrigation systems.

Forward sales contract (FSC), which is an agreement made

between a buyer and a producer to sell agricultural commodities

to a buyer on an agreed future date at a pre-determined price,

was initiated in 1999 by the Central Bank. The InternationalBank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank)

supported the initial programme by providing assistance underits Development Marketplace project. The Central Bank

implemented this progralnme by co-ordinating the activities

undertaken by participating financial institutions (PFIs) and

participatory agencies (PAs) tluoughout the country. During the

year under review, several awareness programmes were heldin major agricultural areas in order to extend the system to

cover a large geographical area with new crops, such as ginger,

sunflower and papaya. In recognition of the impact of the FSC

system to stabilise the prices of agricultural commodities, theCentral Bank, in consultation with the government, has

increased the upper limit of purchasing loans from Rs.5 millionto Rs.25 million per bonower during the year under review.

RDD with the collaboration of the RDBs and its RegionalOffices (ROs) implemented a programme for improving theproductivity in the agricultural sector on a pilot basis in 2W4.The main focus is to introduce new technology, i.e., dripinigation (micro inigation) systems, improved post-harvest

technologies, application of inputs (fertiliser and hybrid seeds).

The selected crops by RDBs under the programme are paddy,

other field crops and vegetables, which deserve being treatedwith priority in view of their significance as main income

earners. During the year under review, RDD has conducted

meetings with suppliers of new technology and buyers of the

agricultural products to enable them to import new knowledgeto farmers.RDD continued to monitor the activities of the sixRegional Development Banks (RDBs) with the objective of

Statistics and Field Surveys

ln20M, the Statistics Department (SD) accomplished two maintasks, namely, performing the routine functions of datacollection, compilation, analysis and dissemination of statisticson key macro economic variables and completion of the fieldwork on the Consumer Finances and Socio Economic Survey2003104 (CFS 2003/04) that was started in the previous year.While the former covers the statistics on national accounts,prices, wages and employment, the latter is intended to generateperiodical survey data on a wide array of socio economicvariables to assess the quality of life and socio economic

developments in Sri Lanka, an exercise conducted by the Bankat regular intervals since 1953.In the current survey, the field work was completed inOctober and the data editing and verihcation were concludedby December 20M. Based on the preliminary findings of thesurvey, a public seminar was also conducted by the Bank inDecember. The final report is due to be issued in mid 2005,but the preliminary data could be accessed from the Bank'swebsite, www.centralbanklanka.org.

Consumer Finances and Socio EconomicSurvey (CFS) 2003104

The CFS 2003104 is the 8th in the series of household surveysthat commenced over fifty years ago with a view to collectinginformation on key socio-economic variables at the householdlevel. The field work of the CFS 2003/04, which commencedon 05 October 2003 was completed on l0 October 2004. Thefield enumeration consisted of four rounds of three monthseach. In each round, one fourth of the sampled households wereenumerated covering 9 provincel in the country, except the3 districts of Mannar, Killinochchi and Mullativu in theNorthern Province. A very successful field programme thatcovered 11,722 households in 1,508 blocks, resulted in almosr100 per cent coverage for blocks and99.6 per cent responserate for households. These were the highest ever recordedcoverage and response rates in the survey series. Takingadvantage of the ceasefire and the expanded coverage of theCensus of Population and Housing 2001, the Department wasable to cover the Districts of Jaffna, Vavuniya, Batticaloa andTrincomalee for the first time, after a lapse of 20 years, in thissurvey. Consequently, the data generated in this survey willupdate the current database on socio-economic conditions athousehold level, that would serve to assess the living conditionsof households in the entire country. Also, the informationcollected in the survey on prices, wages and householdconsumption would be used to compile and update indices onprices and wages and to estimate private consumptionexpenditure in the national accounts of the country.

Country Wide Data Collection System(CWDCS)

Data collection under the CWDCS is accomplished through anisland-wide network of school teachers who function as fieldinvestigators. In January 2004, there were 93 centres under theCWDCS throughout the country, excluding the Northern andEastern Provinces. Some improvements were introduced to thesystem during the year. First, the geographical coverage wasincreased by establishing l4 new data collection centres in theNorthern and Eastern Provinces, where data had not beenavailable for nearly 15 years due to the civil disturbances.Second, a new set of data collection formats was designed,taking into account current developments in markets in the areaof product differentiation, vanishing of existing products andtrade names, and emerging of new economic activities. Third,the field supervision programme was strengthened and allcentres were monitored according to a pre-set timetable. As inthe past, four regional seminars in Matara, Kandy, Colombo

and Anuradhapura were conducted to provide refresher trainingto the investigators in order to improve the accuracy, quality,efficiency and timeliness of their data collection and also toeducate them on contemporary developments in the economy,so that such knowledge can be transfened to school children

and other members of the society. In addition, a two-day

residential training progranrme was conducted in Trincomaleefor the teachers selected as field investigation from the North

and East.

National and Regional Income Accounts

The Department continued to compile the annual and thequarterly estimates of Sri Lanka's national accounts. These

included the collection of primary and secondary data and the

estimation of key parameters in relation to overall production,

consumption, savings and investment in the country. The

estimates were disseminated to the public through the print and

electronic media in2004 as well. The quarterly estimates were

disseminated through 3 media conferences held in accordancewith the advance release calendar. The work initiated in 2003to build a data series on quarterly national accounts by theexpenditure method continued throughout 2004 and

incorporated further improvements to the methodology. These

estimates are expected to be finalised shortly.As in the recent past, the Department also compiled the

annual Gross Domestic Product disaggre-eated by hovince with

a lag of one year, for 2002. These statistrs were made availableto the public as a time series, from 19! 6 to 2002, in the 2003Annual Report, for the first time. The series provide

comprehensive statistics for policy makers in analysing andidentifying regional disparities in economic activities andgrowth performances in the country.

Prices, Wages and Employment

The Department compiled and analysed six monthly priceindices. While the five regional consumer prices indices

measured the aggregate price movements in retail prices in five

different regions, the Wholesale Price Index measured the same

for producer or wholesale prices. The prices necessary for the

compilation of all indices were either collected through the

CWDCS or by investigators outsourced from a company and

trained by the Department.In addition, the Department continued with rhe analysisof movements of consumer prices based on the Colombo

Consumers' Price Index (CCPD and the Sri Lanka Consumers'

Price Index (SLCPI) which are compiled by the Department

of Census and Statistics (DCS). The Department also continuedto issue a monthly press release on int'lation movements as

measured by the CCPI and CDCPL In addition, a system ofquarterly reports to the Monetary Board analysing price and

wage movements was established during the year. Also,preliminary work was undertaken from the beginning of the

year to compile an Informal Sector Wage Rate Index (ISWRI)

for Sri Lanka, based on the CWDCS wage data and the CFS

employment structure in the informal sector. This project was

completed in December 2004.The Department continued to conduct its Annual and

Quarterly Public Sector Employment Surveys. Information

from both surveys was used in the compilation of the national

income accounts. Key findings from these surveys were also

reported on a regular basis to the Monetary Board throughout

the year.
