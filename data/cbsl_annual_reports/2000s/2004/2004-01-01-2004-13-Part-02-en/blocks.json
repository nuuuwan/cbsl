In each round, one fourth of the sampled households wereenumerated covering 9 provincel in the country, except the3 districts of Mannar, Killinochchi and Mullativu in theNorthern Province. A very successful field programme thatcovered 11,722 households in 1,508 blocks, resulted in almosr100 per cent coverage for blocks and99.6 per cent responserate for households. These were the highest ever recordedcoverage and response rates in the survey series. Takingadvantage of the ceasefire and the expanded coverage of theCensus of Population and Housing 2001, the Department wasable to cover the Districts of Jaffna, Vavuniya, Batticaloa andTrincomalee for the first time, after a lapse of 20 years, in thissurvey. Consequently, the data generated in this survey willupdate the current database on socio-economic conditions athousehold level, that would serve to assess the living conditionsof households in the entire country. Also, the informationcollected in the survey on prices, wages and householdconsumption would be used to compile and update indices onprices and wages and to estimate private consumptionexpenditure in the national accounts of the country.",
