NATIONAL OUTPUT AND EXPENDITURE

2.1 Overview

[n2004, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 5.4 per cent.Although in line with the growth in the recent past of around

5 per cent per annum, it was somewhat lower than the 6 per centrecorded in 2003 indicating the need for accelerating the rateof growth to be compatible with the medium term targets. TheServices and Industry sectors maintained similar growth rates

as in the previous year with many sub-sectors achieving highergrowth rates than in 2003. Consequently, the deceleration ingrowth in 2004 was mainly due to the poor performance incertain Agriculture sub-sectors and electricity generation. The

adverse weather affected plantation agriculture in certain areas,

as well as paddy production in both Maha and Yala cultivation

seasons, and hydro electricity generation. The deceleration ingrowth re-rejterated the necessity for addressing deep-rootedstructural weaknesses in the economy, particularly in theagriculture and energy sectors, in order to ensure a sustainablehigh growth. The _qrowth was supported by both consumptionand investment demand, both of which grew healthily, at asomewhat lower pace in real terms than in the previous year.Investment as a share of GDP rose from 22 to 25 per cent, yetstill below the desired level to maintain a hisher and sustainablegrowth.In the first quarter of 2004, the economy achieved wellover 6 per cent growth in a stable foreign exchange marketand a low inflation and low interest rate environment,although dry weather prevailed in certain districts. Stron,eglobal demand stimulated exports, while investment growthwas healthy, particularly in the first half of the year.However, in the wake of adverse weather conditions, thishigher growth momentum was not sustainable, and the GDP

growth decelerated somewhat thereafter. The lower growthrate, especially in the fourth quarter, also reflected the highbase eftect from the previous year. Meanwhile, the rise ininternational prices of intermediate goods, particularly oil,coupled with the depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee and

wa-ee increases, raised the domestic costs of production. Theterms of trade deteriorated by 5 per cent mainly driven bythe high intemational prices of intermediate and investmentgoods, limiting the contribution from expanding externaltrade to economic growth and emphasised the need forraising productivity in the country.As in previous years, the Services sector recorded thehighest growth (7.6 per cent) and contributed 77 per cent ofthe overall growth. Telecommunications, import trade andtjnancial services contributed most to the overall growth inthis sector, while tourist related services, cargo handling andexport trade also performed well. The Industry sector grewby 5.2 per cent and contributed,26 per cent of the growth.In this sector, stron_q performances recorded in the domestic,as well as the export oriented factory industries with therecovery of the global economy, and a buoyant constructionsector supported this growth. The negative contribution ofthe Agriculture sector was due to dry weather in certaindistricts that affected paddy and coconut cultivation, althoughsome domestic agriculture sub-sectors performed well, withfarmers switching to less water intensive crops than paddyto make optimum use of the available water resources.On the expenditure fiont, GDP at current market priceswas estimated at Rs. 2,029 billion in 2004, recording anincrease of 15.2 per cent. This higher rate of increase, despitea deceleration in real economic growth, was more due tothe increase in the general price level. The overall priceinf-lation as measured by the GDP deflator was 9.2 per cent,in comparison to 5 per cent recorded in 2003, The higherincrease in the deflator was explained by the increases inpublic sector wages and international prices of intermediategoods such as petroleum products and other raw materials,and the depleciation of the Sri Lanka rupee by around 5per cent, on average, against the US Dollar. The GDP percapita for 2004 is estimated at Rs. 104,347, an increase ofl4.l per cent over the previous year. In US dollar terms,per capita GDP increased by 8.8 per cent, from US dollars948 in 2003 to 1,031 in 2004.The economic recovery that took place in 2002 and2003, t'rom the first ever contraction in 2001. was driven inno small measure by consumer confidence, also supportedby the recovery in exports.

Consequently, the teal investment growth in 2004 \,as lo\\'erthan in the previous year. Prices of imported investmentgoods, rvhich had declined shatply in 2003, had ri.sen

per cent in real ferms, compared to a,erowth of 6.6 per cent in2003. The NFIA remained ne_sative as usual, but decreasedfurther by 19.3 per cent in 200.1, compared to improvementsshown in the past f'ew years. This was mainly due to higheroutf'lows on account of debt service payments and repatriationof plot)ts and dividends, despite an increase in interest earningsin2004 on lower fbreign reserves at higlrer global interest rates.In2004, in the aggregate supply of -qoods and services, 65per cent was provided by domestic economic activities, whilethe rest was imported. Of the domestic supply, the supply ofservices outperformed that of goods, rvhere the value of tradingactivities, transport, communication and financial servicescontributed most. The supply of imports comprised ofintermediate goods (53 per cent), investment goods (18 per

cent), consumer goods ( l6 per cent), and services ( 13 per cent).In the aggregate demand, consumption accounted for 57 per'cent, nearly 90 per cent of which was private consumption.Capital formation accounted for l8 per cent of the aggregatedemand, to rvhich private capital formation contributed nearly9l per cent. External demand, the demand for exports of goods

and services, accounted fbr the remaining 25 per cent. Around79 per cent of exports was of goods. The difference betweenexternal supply and demand emphasises that the availableresources for utilisation exceed domestic production.A-eainst this back-eround, the growth prospects for theeconomy need t0 be reviewed in the aftermath of the Tsunamitidal wave that hit about 85 per cent of Sri Lanka's coastlineon26 December 2004. The human tra_uedy is immeasurable,with around 30,000-40,000 lives lost and around 100,000

homes destroyed or dama-eed, leading to displacement and lossof livelihoods of around half a million people (2-3 per cent ofthe population). The economic sectors that were most affectedwere fisheries, tourism, small industry and small scalewholesale and retail tradin_q. The destr-uction along theSouthern and Eastern coastal belt has had an immediate impacton beach resorts in the tourist industry, while devastating thefisheries sector. In addttion, small-scale industries, cotta,qeindustries and wholesale and retail trading establishments weredestroyed or dama_ged, while telecommunications, electricityand water supply services were also affected temporarily inthose areas.Although minimal for the year 2004, the impact oneconomic activity in 2005 will largely depend on how fast thesesectors will bounce back, as they have after previous setbacks,and the speed and efficiency of reconstruction andrehabilitation. In fact, certain sectors such as construction,import trade and port services are expected to grow at a higherrate rvith implementation of rehabilitation and reconstructionprojects, while the badly aff'ected sectors are not expected toachieve the grorvth rates anticipated prior to the disaster.Horvever, the economy could perform even better, under stton_qcommitment to, and efficient and timely implementation of, awell-planned reconstruction and rehabilitation programme forthe countrv.

2.2 Sectoral Policies and InstitutionalSupport

In 2004, the government indicated its support of economicactivity in all three sectors throu-uh policies that encouragedprivate participation and focussed on addressing severe

regional disparities in economic opportunities and improving

sectoral productivity, while attempting to balance protection

granted to market participants, both producers and consumers,

as cost-push intlationary pressure accelerated, particularly inthe latter half of the year. The -eovernment in its policydocument has stated its commitment to revitalise tne

Agriculture sector with the broad objective of attaining food

security while raising income levels of farmers, in the contextof the smallholder nature of most of the A-triculture sector in

the country. The main thrust of the new industrial policy of the

government is to develop a -elobally competitive and vibrantindustrial sector. thereby placin-e Sri Lanka as a preferreddestination for investment. This is to be achieved by

encouragin-q the participation of a strong, socially responsible

private sector and a strong, facilitative public sector. The newindustrial policy has emphasised the need for enhancingincome generation activities and creation of employment

through the opening of untapped domestic market opportunitiesin all regions, and local resources based export industries, The

overall policy tiamework is to be based on market friendly and

export-oriented strategies supported by a strong regulatory and

le-qal framework. The -eovernment will play a key role inproviding facilities for enhancing market access and

competitiveness, while improving the business environment

and govemance.

Agricultural Policy and lnstitutional SupportIn the context of this broad policy framework, the

-qovernment's agricultural policy encouraged the sector through

specific policies consistent with its key objective, while giving

a -qreater role to the public sector. Towards this end, thegovernment launched programmes to redesign policies,

subsidise inputs, rehabilitate tanks, provide new technology,

modernise agricultural research and trainin-q and encourageprivate sector participation in agriculture. Emphasis has also

been placed on the development of horticulture and floriculture

in view of the export earning and employment potential in these

two sectors.The overall trade policy measures in 2004, especiallyimport tariff on agriculture, were directed to achieve the trvoobjectives of reducing the cost of living and providin-e

protection to the producers, which are difficult to achieve

simultaneously. Specific import duties on potatoes, big onions

and chillies were reduced by Rs. 1.50, Rs. 5.00 and Rs. 10.00

per kg, respectively, to Rs 18.50, Rs 3.00 and Rs 20.00, per k,e,

respectively, with effect from I February 2004, to reduce the

cost of livin-e, However, the specific duty on big onion was

restored with effect fiom 16 September 2004 with the start of

the harvesting season, to protect farmers. The specific duty of

Rs 4,50 per k-e on sLl-qar importS was waived with effbct froml9 March 2004 to provide relief to consumers in the wake of

increasin-u prices in the international markets. However, in

order to lessen this impact on domestic producers, it rvas re-

imposed fbr broivn sugar tl'om I October 2004. The specific

duty of Rs 9 per kg on rice imports was waived for the period

f}om 22 September 2004 to l5 January 2005 torvards reducin-ehigh domestic rice prices caused by the production shortfall.

The government also imposed a cess of 20 per cent on value

or Rs.l5 per k,e on imporred fiuits with effect tiom 4 November2004 to promote the consumption of local fruits amon,q

consumers,With the objective of stabilising paddy prices atreasonable levels, the -eovernment announced a paddy-

purchasing scheme, first for the 2004 Yala and later, for the

2004105 Maha season, under which the government would

purchase quality paddy at fixed prices from the farmer.However, in view of the supply shortfall, the scheme wasineftective durin.e the Yala season.

The government continued to provide crop subsidies andvarious other fbrms of assistance directly and through other

agencies to encourage expansion of production. The Tea SmallHoldin-es Development Authority (TSHDA) continued to

support the tea smallholders by providing necessary advisorv

and extension services and implementin-Q new-planting and re-planting subsidy schemes. The subsidy scheme is tinanced by

a cess on tea exports of Rs. 2.50 per kg. The cess fund, wlrich

receives around Rs. 750 million per annum, is also used tor

research and development, tea factory development and tea

promotion activities. Considering the attractive prices receivedfor natural rubber in recent years, the rubber cess was

reintroduced in October 2004 to raise funds needed for thedevelopment of the rubbel' industry, mainly to provide

subsidies for new planting and replanting and for research and

development. The upward revision of the rubber replantin-e

subsidy from Rs. 49,000 to Rs. 100,000 per ha and extensionof subsidy schemes to cover plantation companies is expectedto expand rubber cultivation. The government also intends tointroduce a cess on imported edible oil to stren-ethen the

coconut cess fund. Necessary action has been taken to amend

the Fra-ementation and Contlol Act of Tea and Rubber to

include coconut, to prevent coconut land fragmentation. The

Department of Export A-ericulture (DEA) continued to play a

key role in the development of the export agriculture sector by

implementing subsidy schemes and providing necessary inputs,

technical advice and extension services for cultivating and

processing spices,A new National Fisheries Policy has been drafted by the

National F'isheries Policy Council (NFPC) aimed at promotin-e

the local fishing industry with special fbcus on the developmentof small-scale fishermen. The development programmes

consist of facilities to increase marine fish production bydeveloping coastal aquaculture, introducing new fishin-e

technologies, improving storage facilities and modernisin-q

existing harbour tacilities and promoting multi-day fishing.A project to upgrade inland fishery and aquaculturedel'elopment was launched by the National AquaticDevelopment Authority (NAQDA) rvith donor assistance. For

sustainable development of prawn farmin_9, the govemment hasallocated funds under the Bud-eet 2005 for immediateinfrastructure rehabilitation and environment protection.At present, the local milk supply is only around 20 percent of the demand. Hence, the sovernment has paid specialattention to improve milk production in the country. Thegovernment has introduced the Dairy Farmer EmpowermentProject to provide trainin_u, help in marketing and conduct

veterinary clinics for animals. In addition, action has been taken

to set up 50 dairy villages with at least 20 dairy farmers in eachvillage. The VAT on animal feed was removed to brin_e down

the cost of production in the livestock industry. Steps are beingtaken to expand the supply of breedin_e animals, improveveterinary services and support the Veterinary ResearchInstitute for further development of the dairy sector.With a view to encouraging private sector participation inagriculture, the government provided various incentives in theBudget 2005. These included exemption of income and profiton a,qriculture from taxes tbr 5 years, provision of technicalknow how and extension services to small and medium -growersof floriculture and identiflcation of lands for the private sectorto be used as model farms. Seed and plantin_e material imports

were exempted from VAT. With a view to promoting organic

a_ericulture, which has a niche export market, steps were takento set up a certification system and to declare selected areas asprotected organic products zones. Steps have also been taken

to improve research and product development in the cinnamonindustry and to set up a Cinnamon Development Fund to be

funded by a cess on cinnamon exports. In the Bud_eet 2005, thegovemment also proposed a special credit line fbr small andmedium scale paddy millers to modernise their mills.

Industrial Policy and Institutional Support

The present industrial policy has placed emphasis onrationalisin-e and simplifying the existing tariff stlucture aimedat reducin-e the number of tariff bands. The lon_Q-termobjectives of these initiatives are to bring down the tariff rateof raw materials and machinery to zero level, aiming atimproving competitiveness of exports, The Taritf Council setup by the previous government in 2003 emerged as the tradeand tariff cluster of the National Council for EconomicDevelopment (NCED) under the new govemment in 2004. Thecluster was entrusted with studying the anomalies of theexisting tariff structure and other concerns raised by the various

chambers and trade associations. During the year, the Ministryof Industry and lnvestment Promotion (MIIP) also conductedinvestigations on tariff anomalies and made recommendationsto minimise the negative impact of such distortions.

In 2004, the government made a special effort to enhancecompetitiveness of selected thrust industries. The targeted

thrust industries were textiles and apparel, footwear, leatherproducts, ceramics, rubber, and wood and u,ood based

industries, Major programmes implemented by the -aovernmentin 2004 included product development programmes, factoryexpansion and modernisation pro.qrammes and capacitybuildin-e pro-qrammes for business development serviceproviders, In collaboration with the Joint Apparel AssociationForum (JAAF), the MIIP launched several productivityimprovement, skills development and image buildin_sprogrammes fbr that sector.Recognising the potential of small and medium scaleenterprises (SMEs) in creating employment and incomegeneration activities, the government intends to promote theSME sector by establishing a multi-pron_eed supportmechanism. Measures are to be taken to streamlinebureauclatic procedures and regulations, value added taxadministration, Customs re_eulations and export procedures,and increase training through universities and technicalinstitutions. Institutional support would be provided forimprovin_u technical capabilities, quality management,productivity improvement, Internet access and to obtain ISO9000/14000 certitlcation. The govemment is also planning totake measures to increase their access to venture capital funds

and credit at competitive interest rates. This will be achievedby establishin-e a new bank to promote SMEs. To improve theproductivity and competitiveness of SME apparel industries inSri Lanka, the Budget 2005 off'ered several incentives,including providing financial assistance for technologyimprovements, simplified VAT applications, and incentives toimprove productivity and to develop backward Iinkages. The

Bud-eet 2005 also proposed several other incentives for humanresources development and skills development by increasing

the intake to vocational training institutes to 50,000, settin-e up

a new University of Vocational Technology, restructuring the'Tharuna Aruna' program into a Skills Development Fund andestablishin-q a new incentive scheme to encourage SMEs to

acquire advanced technology aimed at raising productivity andimploving competiti veness.

2.3 Output

Agriculture

The Agriculture, forestry and fishing sector, which expandedby 1.6 per cent in value added terms in the previous year,

contracted marginally by 0.7 per cent in2004 mainly due to theimpact of inadequate rainfall on certain major crops. Therelative importance of the Agriculture sector continued todecline from l9 per cent of the GDP in 2003 to l8 per cent in2004, owin.e to the low contribution from paddy production.The drought in the districts of Anuradhapura and Kurunegalain the Maha season due to the failure of the Northeast monsoon

and the delay in the onset of the Southwest monsoon in the Yalaseason caused this decline. However', production of other'subsidiary food crops and vegetables improved, as f'armers

whrch includes, ve-qetables, subsidiary food crops, minor expollcrops, animal husbandry, sugarcane, tobacco and fruits,

expanded by 3.2 per cent in value added terms compared to 1.9

sector recorded an improvement of I.6 per cent. [n plantation

agriculture, tea production partly recovered fiom the damage

caused by floods in mid 2003, and rubber production further

increased, benefiting from attractive prices, while coconut

output fell.Export agriculture: In 2004, most export crops, tea.

rubber, and minor export crops pertormed satisf'actorily, largelybenefiting from attractive prices.

Tea production increased by 1.6 per cent to 308 millionkg, partly recovering from the setback experienced due tofloods in mid 2003. The recovery was solely due to asignificant improvement in low -qrown tea production, which

responded to favourable weather conditions that prevailed in

the low grown areas. In contrast, tea production in the high andmedium elevations declined by 9 per cent and 8 per cent

respectively, due to the spell of dry weather that prevailed in

those areas. The production of cut, tear and curl (CTC) teadeclined for the second consecutive year by 9 per cent to l6million kg, resultin-e f'rom changes in relative prices in favourof orthodox tea production.The smallholder tea sector continued to dominate by

contributing 66 per cent of the total tea production in 2004. The

average yield in the smallholder sector was 2,448 kg per ha incomparison to 1,275 kg per ha in the estate sector. The

estimated national average yield rvas 1,863 k-e per ha in 2004r.

The average cost of tea production increased by l6 per cent to

Rs. 158.25 per kg in2004 due to increases in input prices such

as fertiliser, a-qrochemicals and fuel and the estate sector wageincrease implemented under a collective agreement from

November 2004.

to systematic infillin_e are required to increase productivity.New plantin-e and replantin-e of rubber increased in 2004

encoura-eed by attractive prices and incentives granted by the

-qovernment. The government also took an initiative in 2004 to

encoura-qe rubber planting in non-traditional rubber grorvin_e

areas such as Monera,uala.

Coconut production dropped marginally by 0.2 per cent to2,557 million nuts in 2004, following a7 per cent increase in

2003. The reduction occurred entirely during the latter part of

the year, due to the la-e,ued effect of the drought in late 2003 andthe spread of mite attack from mid 2004. As a result, the

producer price of fresh coconut, which had declined during thefirst half, rose sharply by the end of 2004. Both desiccatedcoconut and coconut oil production increased by l9 per cent

each during the year due to attractive prices throughout the year.

The introduction of regional fresh coconut auctions in 2004 also

helped coconut growers to receive remunerative prices for theirproduce. Meanwhile, the cost of production for coconut

increased by 53 per cent due to relatively higher wa-ee costs with

the shortfall in production and increases in other input costs.Among other export crops, production of cinnamon,

cloves, cocoa, coffee, cashew and cardamom increased duringthe year, while production of pepper and nutmeg declined.

Even thou-eh Sri Lanka is the largest producer and exporter ofcinn;rmon in the world market, value addition for cinnamon isstill at a low level. The proposed Cinnamon Development Fundis expected to support further development of the cinnamonindustry, especially expansion of value added products,The foliage and cut flower sector has expandedsignificantly in recent years with assistance provided by the

Department of Agriculture (DOA) and the Export DevelopmentBoard (EDB) and the active participation of private

entrepreneurs. There is an attractive domestic market as well

as a foreign market for foliage and cut flowers. The rising

demand for landscaping tbr commercial buildings, hotels andresidencies. as well as for floral arransements for social

functions, and increased participation in the industry by small-

scale entrepreneurs throu,gh plant sales and exhibitions indicatethe rapid expansion of the sector in the domestic market.Furthermore, the expolt earnings from this sector were Rs. 915million in2004, at around the same level as in 2003 comparedto Rs 776 million in2002, The proposed assistance fiom the

Bud-qet 2005 to develop the floriculture sector would suppoftflrther expansion of this sector.Domestic agriculture: The domestic agriculture sectorsuffered a setback in 2004 mainly due to the significantshortfall in paddy production, the largest mono crop cultivatedin Sri Lanka. However, production of other field crops such asbig onion, red onion and vegetables increased, as farmers

shifted trom paddy to these crops to get maximum benefit fromavailable water.

Paddy production declined by 14.4 per cent to2,628,000metric tons (126 million bushels) during the 2004 cultivationyear fiom the peak output of 3,071,000 metric tons(147 million

bushels) in the preceding year, following a drop of 2l per centin the extent sown. However, annual average yield had

increased by 9 per cent to a record level of 4.09 metric tons per

ha, surpassing the previous peak yield level of 3.95 metric tonsper ha achieved in 2001 reflecting the concentration ofcultivation under irrigated conditions. The paddy output in

2003104 M;rha season dropped by 11.9 per cent, while theoutput in Yula season declined sharply by 18.6 per cent, due toreduction in both seasons in the extent cultivated under drou,{htconditions.The farm gate price of paddy remained attractivethroughout the year due to the shortfall in supply as a result of

the low production and low imports of rice during the tirst thneequarters of 2004. Imports were delayed under marketanticipation of a waiver from the relatively high specific importduty on rice that was finally given in mid September.Consequently, the average farm gate price in 2004 was Rs

16.17 per kg, an increase of 36 per cent compared to 2003. As

major constraints affecting the development of the sugarindustry. Consequently, around 90 per cent of the domesticrequirement continues to be imported.The Livestock sector, which mainly consists of the dairyand poultly industries, recorded mixed pertbrmance durin_9the year. It has been estimated that total milk productionhas grown by 3 per cent to 162 million litres in 2004.However, the total milk collection increased by l3 per centin 2004 due to an improved collection network. Producerprices of milk paid by the two state-run market playersincreased twice durin_e the year from Rs. 15 per litre to Rs.l6 per litre and further to Rs. l8 per litre to encourage dairyfarmers. In parallel with the _qovernment's initiatives toincrease production and popularise fresh milk consumption,private milk-processing companies introduced dift'erent liquidmilk products to expand the market for milk. Furthermore,the private sector has invested in milk processin.e plants atre_eional level to expand fresh milk production andmanufacturin.e of milk-based products to cater to the risingdemand. The recently conducted CFS 2003104 also revealed

an increase in per capita consumption of milk products sincethe mid 1990s.

Poultry meat production is estimated to have increased in2004by 7 per cent to 94.7 million kg compared to 2003.However, e-e-e production declined by 1.2 per cent to 871million. An outbreak of the bird flu in East Asian countries inFebruary 20Madversely affected the domestic poultry industry

too durin-{ the first half of the year, as domestic consumers were

reluctant to consume poultry meat due to fear of the disease.

The decline in demand badly affected the smallholder poultry

sector due to a substantial decline in poultry meat prices andlack of cold storage facilities to store meat. However, thegovernment and the private sector launched several public

awareness programmes to educate consumers to minimise theimpact. The ban on the import of parent stocks as a safety

measure hindered the potential grorvth of both poultry meat and

egg production in 2004.Forestry: ln 2004, the Forest Department continuedseveral projects to develop the forestry sector with the

assistance of foreign donor agencies. Under these projects,

several activities were undertaken to promote re-forestation.

Several plantation management companies have diversifiedtheir unproductive lands into forestry. According to theMinistry of Plantation Industries, the land area utilised for suchdiversification was 14,079 hectares. Compared to the previous

year, this was a 48 per cent increase. Of these forest plantations,

over 64 per cent are concentrated in the Nuwara Eliya andBadulla districts. There are many investors en-qaged incommercial torest plantations activities and therefore, the

extent of newly planted area under commercial scale private

forest plantations is expected to increase in the future. There is

stron-q potential for increasing value addition in this sector,which remains yet untapped. In 2004, the State TimberCorporation continued to supply timber to the public and

paddy prices were high, many farmers sold their harvestwithout keeping adequate quantities of seed paddy. This led to

a shortfall in quality seed paddy for the 2004105 Maha season,

as favourable weather conditions during the latter part of theyear and good paddy prices encouraged tarmers to extend thecultivation area in the 2004105 Maha season.Despite the drop in extent cultivated due to the drou_qht,output of major field crops, particrrlarly potato, big onion, redonion, kurakkan, green gram, groundnuts and maize, increasedin 2004. However, a si-enificant share of the domesticrequirement of key items such as onions and potatoes continue

to be imported. In 2004, the total supply of potato and big onion

was lower than in 2003 due to a decline in imports fbllowing

increases in import duties in 2004. Meanwhile, demand fromboth domestic consumers and the tourism sector rose. Hence,prices did not decline, despite the increase in production.Vegetable production in both Maha and Yala seasonsincreased. Production of both up-country and low-countryvegetables rose. However, although market prices felltbllowing the Maha season, prices in2004 did not come downin line with the increase in production due to the hi_sh cost of-inputs and transportation. Fruit production in 2004 rose with

higher output from banana (22 per cent), passion fruit (18 per

cent), pineapple (4 per cent) and papaya (27 per cent) whileprices remained at similar levels to the previous year. Duling2004, imports of fresh and dried fruits amounted to 24,000

metric tons, a decline of 26 per cent over 2003. An additionalcost of a cess on imported fruits was imposed in November2004 to stimulate the local fruit farming industry,

Sugarcane production declined by I per cent in 2004following a 42 per cent increase in the precedin-q year.However, sugar output at both Sevana,eala and Pelrvatta

factories rose during the year. The extent under sugarcane aswell as sugzu'production continue to increase since the privatesector took over operation of these factories in 2002.

Marine fish production contributed to nearly90 per cent of the total fish catch, of which the coastal fish catchwas 60 per cent. Even though the offshore fish catch reportedan increase of 9 per cent, the coastal fish catch declined by 6per cent, due to unfavourable weather conditions in most of thecoastal belt. particularly in the Iatter half of 2004, therebyaffecting overall marine sector production. The aquaculturebased prawn industry has reported a setback in recent yearscausin-t heavy losses to investors.

The Bud_eet 2005 hasallocated funds for immediate infrastructure rehabilitation workand environmental protection in this sector.The frsheries sector was severely affected by the Tsunamitidal waves that hit two third of the coastline of the island. Itis estimated that nearly 80 per cent of active fishermen wereaff-ected and more than 75 per cent of the fishing fleet wasdestroyed or damaged by the Tsunami. In addition, a largenumber of small-scaie fishin,e craft and fishin_e gear weredestroyed. Of the 12 fishing harbours, l0 were severelydamaqed, includin_e breakrvaters, buildings, machinery andequipment. In addition, public and private utilities such as iceplants, Ianding ports, markets, and houses of the fishingcommunity were destroyed. Consequently, the full impact ofthe disaster will be felt in 2005, initially, on demand and, for

a longer period, on supply. The full recovery of the sector willdepend on the speed and efficiency of the recovery process.

Industry

The Industrial sector, spanning the fbur sectors of Minin,e andquarrying, Manufhcturin_e, Construction and Electricity andwater, re_eistered a -growth of 5.2 per cent in 2004, The shareof the industry sector in GDP remained at the same level of 26per cent as in 2003. The industry sector contributed 26 per centto the overall growth in2004. The manuf-acturing sector, thelar-{est of the four sub-sectot's, accounted for l6 per cent of

GDP and contributed 16 per cent to overall -erolth in 2004, thecontribution bein_e hi-eher than in 2003. The construction sectoralso contrlbuted significantly with a better performance in2004. The Electricity and water sector was aff'ected by thedlorrght and contracted by 2.5 per cent. The Minin,s andquarryin-q sector did well with a ,erowth of 7.9 per cent over theprevrous year,Manufacturing: Factory industries, the lar-eest sub sectorin the Manufacturing sector, expanded by 6.1 per cent in2004compared to 4.6 per cent ,erowth in 2003. This sub sectorcontributed 59 per^ cent to the overall growth in industry in2004. The _erowth was moderate in the first half, but picked upstrongly in the second half of the year. Private sector industriesaccounted for 96 per cent of the output in the factory industrysector in 2004. The two sub categories of private sectorindustries, BOI and Non-BOI, grew by 7.5 per cent and 4.4percent, respectively, and contributed 55 per cent and 45 per cent,respectively, to overall factory industry output.The major contribution to the growth in factory industriesin 2Q04 (over 90 per cent) arose tiom fbur of the nine majorindustrial categories, viz., textile, apparel and leather products;food, beverages and tobacco products: chemical, petroleum,rubber and plastic products; and non-metallic mineral products.These industries benefited from the global economic recovery,increased domestic consumer demand, the low interest rateregime, continuation of the ceasefire, and improvementsin basic industrial infrastructure facilities such astelecommunications, information technolo-ey and port servicesand simplification of Customs procedures. The competitivenessin exports was facilitated by the improvement in productivity,rationalisation of production costs and depreciation of theexchange rate. The fabricated metal products category alsocontributed to the growth, mainly responding to the rise indomestic demand. Growth of domestic market orientedindustries, which gained momentum since the second half of2003, continued in 2004. The -erowth was seen across allindustrial categories. Greater economic activity, new demandarisin-e tiom the North and the East, a,egressive advertising, andchan-ees in consumer pref-erences stimulated the demand forindustrial products.

The textile, apparel and leather products sector grew by 7.9per cent and contributed 51 per cent to the overall growth in r.ealterms, The entire growth came fiom the apparel sector. With theexpansion in international trade, apparel industries expanded by9.9 per cent amidst stiff international competition, owin-e toimprovements in productivity. The textile and apparel quotasystem under the MFA, which had been operatin-q over the lasttwo decades, came to an end on I January 2005. Since this wasannounced at least a decade ago, a gradual restructurin_q process

has been takin-e place in Sri Lanka to face competition in a quotafree market. The restructurin_e took place by way of productspecialisation, acquisitions and mergeru, process rmprovements,technolo-ry developments, skills development, developingstrate_qic alliances, developi n_{ backward linka,qes and

imptoving marketin-{ capabilities. As a result, the industry was

able to create a hi,eh ima-ee in the international markets through

price, quality and speed of delivery.The apparel sector in 2004 also benefited from thespecial duty concessions received fiom the EU under the

Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) beginning fromFebruary 2004 on Sri Lanka's adherence to internationallabour standards. The apparel quota received fiom India

under the Free Trade Agreement (FIA) was doubled in 2004.The forthcoming Comprehensive Economic Partnership

Agreement (CEPA) with India and FTAs with Pakistan andBIMST-EC will further benefit the garment industry. BothUSA and EU are now considering grant of greater accessfor Sri Lankan products to their markets as a measure ofproviding relief in view of the recent Tsunami disaster.The output of food, beverages and tobacco products

registered moderate growth in 2004 and contributed l7 per

cent to the overall growth, driven by improved performancein food processing, beverages and liquor products. Thegrowth was seen in processed meat products, biscuits, milkproducts, wheat flour processing, fruit and vegetable

processing, tea processing and producticn of liquor, beer and

animal feed. The growth of these industries was in responseto the expansion in domestic demand with higher per capita

income, the surge in the tourism industry, higher consumer

credit, increased trading activities in the North and the East,the expansion of the distribution netrvork and aggressive

marketing campaigns.Chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products, thethird largest category among factory industries, showed arelatively higher growth in 2004, driven by rubber based

industries. This sector contributed l5 per cent to the overallgrowth in factory industry. The healthy growth of the exportoriented rubber based industry is attributed to its duty free

The domestic industry

requirement, of which 16 per cent was imported, amountedto 72 per cent of total domestic natural rubber production,

indicatin-e the rising domestic demand.

The output of non-metallic mineral products grew by -1.6

per cent in 2004 and contributed l0 per cent to the overall

,qrowth in factory industries. This grorvth was driven by theproduction of ceramics, processed diamonds, cement, and

roofin-e sheets, the latter two being in response to the demand

arisin-e from construction. Demand for these products is

expected to grow further with the commencement of re-

construction activities in Tsunami aflected areas. Major sub

sectors in ceramics such as tableware, ornamental ware and

ceramic tiles also grew in 2004 due to penetration into new

external markets and continuous improvement of product

quality.

The -srowth in fabricated metal products arose from higherproduction of agricultural machinery, water pumps, steelfurniture, kitchen appliances, motor cycle assembling,

manuf'acturin-e and repairing of ships and boats and productionof aluminium products, light frttings and bulbs. The domestic

demand for aluminium products, cables, bulbs and light fittings

grew with the expansion in the construction industry, while the

expansion of rural electrification programmes stimulated the

demand for television sets, electrical items and kitchen

appliances.The output of public sector industries, which accounted

fbr only 4 per cent of industrial output, grew by 5' I per cent in

2004, with the uninterrupted production of the Ceylon

Petroleum Corporation (CPC). The output of CPC, which

accounted tbr over 90 per cent of the public sector industrial

output, increased by 5.9 per cent in2004. The other public

sector industries which re.eistered higher gl'owth rates in 2004

were Lanka Phosphates Ltd (7.4 per cent) and Lanka Salt Ltds 046 s,207 6 I 3.2220,050 233;369 4.6 6.ll

The profit ratio of the factory industry sector, estimated

as the ratio of ex-factory value of production to the total costof production, increased marginally in 2004. Continuation of

increasin-e domestic demand, a notable improvement in exports

and depreciation of the rupee helped the increase in revenue.

Cost of production also increased in 2004, due to higher fuel

and other utility prices, and the high cost of imported raw

material, but remained below the revenue increase.The wage bill of the manufacturin_e sector in factory

industry rose by 12per cent in 2004, but its share in the total

cost of production declined mar,sinally due to higher increasesin other input costs. The labour cost was contained by

outsourcing production activities and containing the overtimebill. Although costs of petroleum and gas were hi-qh, the shareof energy cost in the total cost of production increased only

marginally due to various energy saving measures taken by the

producers. lnterest costs as a percentage of the total cost of

production declined mar-qinally, mainly due to the falling

interest rates and improvement in working capital management.

Labour productivity in the manufacturing sector, estimated as

the change in the real value added per man-hour, increased by2.6per cent in 2004. This productivity improvement was seenin all industrial categories and resulted from the use of newtechnology, skills development and the lorv incidence ofindustrial disputes in 2004.Within the manufacturing sector, processing of plantation

crops -qrew mar-uinally due to moderate growth in the output of

tea and rubber, while that of coconut increased sharply due tothe increase in export volumes of desiccated coconut and

coconut oil, despite the drop in production during the latter partof the year.The small industries sub sector contracted marginally

compared with the high growth recorded in the previous year.

in the country, suffered due to the low paddy harvest, while the

small-scale production of coir, coconut shell and copra relatedproducts declined due to the fall in coconut output towards theend of the year. The garments and handlooms industryperfbrrned well, with the improved performances of the lar-re

and mcdium scale -earment factories, while timber mills, rockmetal products, and tiles, bricks, cement blocks and relatedproducts benefited from the growth in the construction

industry.Construction: The Construction sector grew by 6.6 per

cent in 2004, compared with 5.-5 per cent growth during theprevious year. The expansion was mainly due to refurbishment

and expansion in the hotel sector, and increased activity inhousing construction, including apartment complexes andcondominiums. On-going foreign funded infrastructureplojects in water supply, roads, power and port sector

development also contributed to the growth perfbrmance of this

sector. The ,erowth was retlected in high imports of buildingmaterials, sale of cement and other construction materials,

despite hi_eh prices, and disbursement of housing loans by thebankin-{ sector. The demand for residential houses wasstimulated by attractive loan packages oftered by financialinstitutions. Prices of residential houses as well as high-rise

units increased durin,q the year. with the rising demand and costof buildin-e materials. The price indices published by the

Institute for Construction Training and Development (ICTAD)

indicates that prices in construction activities had increased by

18 per cent durin-e the year in comparison with the previous

year.Electricity and rvater: The Electricity and water sector

contracted by 2.5 per cent in 2004 in contrast to the 21.6 per

cent increase in the previous year. Electricity -eeneration and

the demand for electricity incleased by 5.6 per cent and 7.4 per

cent, respectively, due to expandin-e demand fi'om households

and the commercial sector. The CFS 2003104 recorded that

plevious year'. During the year, 63 per cent of the total2.1 electricity was generated thermally, in comparison to 56 per

cent in 2003. Consequently, value addition in the electl'icity sub3.4

)l , sector decreased by 3.5 per cent as a result of hi_eher usa_[e of2.6 thermal power, including hired thelmal power under dry

weather conditions, which had significantly higher generation3.5 costs, Due to the drought conditions, hydropower generated by?: the CEB recorded a decline of I3J per cent durin-q the year2'5 while the thermal power generated by the CEB incleased by3.0 14.3 per cent. Althou_qh private power producers, both thermaland hydro, were able to increase their generation during the2.s year, the additional demand had to be met by hired thermalpower. The water sub sector, rvhich includes collection,purification and distribution of pipe borne water, recorded a

-qrowth of 4.7 per cent compared with 1,3 per cent growth inthe previous year. The CFS 2003104 recorded a significantincrease in the share of households with access to pipe bornewater inside their homes since the mid 1990s.I\{ining and quarry'ing : The Mining and quarryingsector expanrled by 7.9 per cent. The Mining sub sectorperformed welI during the year with better performance in gem

mining and other minin-{ activities, The gem m.ining sector, the

largest sector in terms of value addition, pertbrmed stron,qly in2004 benefitin-e from increased export demand. However,mining activities in relation to graphite, phosphate and mineral

sands also increased significantly. The quarrying sub sector

-erew by 6.6 per cent reflecting the increased demand forbuilding materials from the construction industry.

Services

As in 2003, the growth in the Services sector provided the

major impetus for growth in2004. The service sector glew at

7 .6 per cent, a mar-Einal deceleration from the growth in 2003,

and contributed a major share of the overall growth. The

increase in value added in several Service sub-sectors was

instrumentat in this ,qrowth.Wholesale and retail trade and hotels andrestaurants: The Wholesale and retail trade, hotels and

restaurants sector recorded a growth of 6 per cent in 2004

as against 7.8 per cent in the previous yeal'. The deceleration

was mainly due to lorver -qrowth in trading activities relatedto domestically produced a-gricultural goods, and a relativelylower -srowth in import trade at 9 per cent, compared ttl ahigh I I per cent in 2003. The structure of import trade

-erowth ret-lected the domestic economic expansion. Thegrorvth in consumer goods and intermediate goods importswere 3.9 pel cent and 6.6 per cent in volume terms,

increased demand for inputs mainly tl'om the industrial andservice sectors. Of consumer goods imports, total importsof food and drink declined in volume terms at hi-qher prices,while imports of other consumer -{oods grew healthily. Theexport trade sub sector grerv by 7.1 per cent in 2004,

benefitin-e mainly from the expansion in industrial exportsdominated by textiles and -earments. Industrial exports

recorded a -erowth of 9.1 per cent in 2004 as a-eainst 3.1 percent in the previous year. A-sricultural exports also

contributed positively to the -erowth in export trade reflecting

increases in export volumes of all major plantation crops.The deceleration in the domestic trade sub sector in 2004compared to 2003, indicates the overall decline in theproduction of a-ericultural -eoods traded in the domesticmarket, particularly rice. The hotels and restaurants sub

sector, which is included with the wholesale and retail tradesector under the new classiflcation, grew by 15.9 per centin 2004. The sub sector, which has expanded significantlywith the increase in tourist arrivals after the ceasefire in early2002, further expanded in 2004 with tourist arrivalsincreasing by I3.l per cent to a record 566,202. In 2004,the avera-ee hotel occupancy rate rose to 59 per cent as

against 53 per cent recorded in the previous year. The foteign

guest nights of all graded hotels rerorded an increase of 10.9per cent, while the local guest nights recorded a very

The value addition in the sector rosefollowing the recent investment towards up-eradin-e andcapaclty expansron.Transport, storage and communications: Value addedin the Transport, stora-[e and communication sector increasedby 13.7 per cent in 2004, compared to 10.6 per cent in2003. This sector recorded the highest sectoral growthand was driven by notervorthy performances in thetelecommunications and car-eo handlin-e sub-sectors. The

telecommunications sector, which has continued to grow at

sub-sector, port selvices recorded a growth of 13.3 per centin 2004, ref-lectin-e the expansion in sea car-qo handlin-eactivities. The Port of Colombo handled the hi_shest everannual container throu_ehput of 2.22 million Twenty FootEquivalent Unit (TEUs) in 2004 recordin.e an increase of13.3 per cent. Improved pertbrmance at both Jaye ContainerTerminal (JCT) and South Asia Gatervay Terminal (SAGT)

contributed equally to this perfbrmance in port services. Withthe opening of the Unity Container Terminal (UCT), the

container handlin-e capacity of the Port of Colombo increasedby 250,000 TEUs per year. Transhipment volumes, whichusually account fbr two-thirds of thloughput, recorded a

-ero$'th of 13.5 per cent, while domestic container throughput

increased by 17 per cent. Howevet, ship alrivals durin-e theyear declined mar-ginally by 1.6 per cent reflectin,s a shiftto lar-eer vessels. Meanwhile, air cargo volumes expandedby 26 per cent.The transport sub sector, one of the lar-qest services

sectors in the economy, grew by 4.2 per cent in compadsonto 4.6 per cent -erowth in the previous year. This increase

was the outcome of the combined performance of passengerand freight transpor-t. Road haulage grew by 3.7 per centreflectin-t the implovements in -qoods transport activitiescoupled with the increase in domestic production andinternational trade. Pertormance of the Sri Lanka Railways

was slug-rish. In the passenger transport category the growthperfbrmance in the private bus cate-eory improved marginally,while that of the Cluster Bus Companies contracted duringthe year. In the air travel sub-sector, total passengerkilometers flown by Sri Lankan Airlines increased by 20per cent durin.g the year. However, there was a decline in

passenger kilometers flown by domestic ;rirlines, indicatinga drop in internal air travelling after the pent-up domesticdemand for travel to the North fbllowin-e the ceasefiretapered otf. This decline was also attributed to the non-operation of one of the three domestic airlines durin-s the

latter paft of the year. As indicated by the Registrar of MotorVehicles (RMV), registration of motorcars and dual-purposevehicles had dropped, while that of three-wheelers, busesand motor cycles had increased.Financial services, real estate and business services:The Financial services, real estate and business servicessector, which includes bankin,e, insurance and all otherfinancial services, real estate, ownership of dwellings, rentin-{and all other business service activities that were includedin the services (n.e.s) of the previous classification, grewby 5.7 per cent in 2004 as a-eainst 8.8 per cent in 2003. Thedecelelation was mainly due to slower -erolth of the bankingsub sector afier the hi-uh growth recorded last year. In 2003,interest rates declined sharply. In contrast in 2004, interestrates remained almost unchan-eed at a lower level.Consequently, although the credit growth in the bankin-esector was as high as 20 per cent, the -erowth of net interestincome earned from core banking activities was lo'w

The businessservice activities sub sector, which included advertisin.eservices, private security and janitonal services and computersoftware development activities, -qrew at a moderate rate.Public administration, other government services anddefence and other community, social and personal services:The Public administration, other government services anddefence and other community, social and personal servicesrecorded a growth of 3.9 per cent in2004. The growth in publicadministration was mainly due to the intake of 42,000unemployed graduates to the public sector in the fburth quarrerof 2004. The other community, social and personal services subsector re_eisteled a hi_eher growth of 7.1 per cent against 4.1 in2003, as the private healthcare industry continued to expandstrongly in response to increased demand fbl such healthcareservlces.2.4 Expenditure

The aggre_eate demand generated by domestic economicactivity is measured by Gross Domesric Expenditure (GDE),which is the sum of consumption and investment expenditureof the private and public sectors of the economy. In 2004, GDE(a-egregate domestic demand) at current mrrket prices wasestimated at Rs. 2,214 billion, reflecting an increase of 18.4 percent over 2003. The corresponding increase in domesticdemand fbr 2003 was 10.8 per cent. However, in 2004, theGDE grew by 6.4 per cent in real terms in comparison to 8.2per cent in 2003, which was a consequence of the lower growthin private sector real consumption and investment. GDP atmarket prices, the sum of GDE and net imports, was estimatedat Rs. 2,029 billion, an increase of 15.2 per cent.

Consumption

Consumption expenditure at current market prices wasestimated at Rs. 1,707 billion. an increase of 15.2 per cent over2003. This reflects an increase of 9.8 per cent in the avera-qeprice level and of real consumption by 4.9 per cent. Of the totalconsumption, private consumption expenditure (PCE) rose by14.9 per cent in comparison to the 10.5 per cent reported in2003, while _qovernment consumption increased by 18.3 percent follorving the mar-einal decline in 2003. Consequently, theshare of PCE in the total consumption dropped to 90 per centfrom 9l per cent reported in 2003. In PCE, the expendirure onlocalf y produced goods increased by 13.7 per cent, while theexpenditure on imported goods and non-factor servicesincreased by 17.7 per cent.In compliance with the restructuring of PCE in 2002based on the System of National Accounts-1993 (SNA 93),a base year revision to the PCE was made in 2004. Thisrevision was based on the latest household expendituresurvey, the CFS 2003104.In comparison to the previous baserevisions in 1997, some variations in consumption patternswere observed by 2004. With the improvements in livingstandards and quality of life, the relative share of pCE onbasic needs such as food and beverages had shifted to otherservrce sectors.In keepin-q with the improvements in econolnic well-being arising fiom economic development seen in Sri Lankaduring the recent past, in 2004 too the share of PCE ontbod and non-alcoholic beverages fell further to 32.6 percent. Nominal expenditure on this cate-{ory had risen by 9per cent, due to the increase in prices of lbod items, butshowed no improvement in real terms. Despite priceincreases, nominal expenditure on Alcoholic beverages,tobacco and narcotics declined, therebv reflectins that real

The survey results complemented other findings onregional economic disparities, The Western Provinceret'lected higher living standards than other provinces,commensurate with better education, employment andincome-earning opportunities that relared to itscontribution to overall economic activity and developmentin the country. At the other end of the spectrum, theEastem and Uva provinces, with limited economic activityand opportunity, lagged behind on most socio-economicindicators. The other six provinces lay between these trvoextremes. The demo-eraphic structure and livingconditions in the Northern, Eastern and North Centralprovinces reflected the adverse impact of the civil conflictof 20 years. Historical and continuing disparities amongthe three sectors, urban, rural and estate, were reflectedin these regional disparities. The CFS 2003104 findingsre-emphasise what policy-makers in successivegovernments have been highlighting in recent years,namely, the need to address these regional disparities andcreate income generating opportunities that woutd provideeconomic options tbr citizens everywhere.

Government consumption expenditure increased by 18.3per cent in 2004, due to higher expenditure on salaries and

wages, as well as -qoods and services. Thc salary increase at '

the beginnin-q of the year was reflected in higher expenditureon emoluments, while the intake of 42,000 graduates to thepublic sector under the government's graduate employment

pro-qramme torvards the end of the year also contributed.

lnvestment

Ln2004, investment, even more than consumption, provided the

impetus tor economic grorvth. Investment expenditure (gross

domestic capital formation) at current market prices was

estimated at Rs. 507 billion, an increase of 30.5 per cent over2003.In real terms, the investment expenditure rose by I1.7 per

cent, whereas the corresponding growth in 2003 was l6 per

cent. The investmenUGDP ratio further improved to 25 per centfrom22.l per cent in 2003. The increase in imports of

investment goods by 18,4 per cent, in volume terms, clearly

indicated that investment demand out-perfonned consumption

demand and provided the impetus for the growth in 2004. The

recovery in investment expenditure was led by the private

sector, where private investment expenditure accounted for'91

per cent of the total investment and expanded by 32.7 per cent

in2004. The private sector investment/GDP ratio continued to

,qrow fiom 19.8 per cent in 2003 to 22.7 per cent in 2004. Large

investments flowed in to the garment industry to improve theirproductivity and prepare for challenges that lay ahead rvith the

phasin-9 out of the MFA in 2005. Revival of tourist arrivals

after the ceasefire a-qreement was a cause for higher investmentin the leisure industry where many hotels were refurbished,

expanded or upgraded and many new boutique tourist resorts

opened in 2004 to cater to niche market HNW (Hi-th NetWorth) toutists. The telecommunication, transportation,

consumption had dropped sharply. The only other sector tnwhich nominal expenditure had declined and the PCE sharehad fallen was transport. The PCE on transport, which

recorded the highest growth of 48 per cent last year, had

declined by about one per cent in 2004 and its relative sharehad fallen by about 2 percenta-ee points. The higher importtariffs imposed during the latter part of the year and the

subsequent price hikes of vehicles may have restrainedconsumer spending, since then, on vehicle purchases, thesingle lar-eest iten in this category. The PCE on all other

categories rose in nominal terms at varyin,e rates of between15 and 49 per cent and increased their shares in PCE,reflecting both real growth and the higher price levels in

2004. Amon-e all expenditure categories, the highest growthwas recorded by education, althou-eh on a very small shareof less than 2 per cent even after this growth. This -qrowthreflects hi,sher spending on private tuition at all levels ofeducation and private educational institutions that haveexpanded in numbers in recent years, as was seen in thefindin-rs of the CFS 2003/04. The cate-eories of recreationand entertainment, housing and utility services, householdequipment and services and restaurants and hotels, grew innominal terms by between 28 and 34 per cent. The relativeshare on housin-e and utility services increased by 2

percentage points to 16 per cent in 2004 due to the hi-eher

spendin,e on housing repairs, rents, electricity and water. PCE

on communication had increased at a lower rate than in 2003,which may indicate a -eradual deceleration of the growth inthe communication market. especially the

telecommunications sector, which had expanded very rapidlyover the past f'ew years. PCE on health had risen, in keepin-ewith the expansion in such services reported in the previous

sectron.

The BOI, themain investment promotion institution of the govemment alsoapproved 524 projects under Sections 16 and ll2 of the BOIAct with investment commitments of Rs. 140.7 billion, a

decline of 5.5 per cent from 2003 entirely due to reductionsin the local and foreign investment components for projects

under Section 17. Although the number of projects contractedincreased marginally Io 228 in 2004, the value of the

contracted investment declined by 28 per cent on accountof both the domestic and foreign components. The declinewas partly explained by the fall in investment durin-e theperiod of political uncertainty in the first half of the yearand more stringent screening processes introduced by theBOI. With the realisation of investment in agreements signed

and contracted in the previous year, the accumulated realisedinvestments in BOI projects increased by l5 per cent to

36 per cent and the Services and A-griculture sectors absorbedthe rest of the total contracted investment in 2004.

billion, at cunent market prices, an increase of l8 per cent overthe previous year. This increase was generated by an increaseof Rs 268 billion (15.2 per cent) in domestic resources and an

increase of Rs 182 billion (24.5 per cent) in foreign resources.In real terms, the availability of resources grew by 6.8 per cent,slightly lower than in the previous year. This includes realgrowth of domestic resources by 5.4 per cent and of imports ofgoods and non-factor services by 9.3 per cent. The

co{responding growth rates in 2003 were 6.0 per cent and 10.2per cent, respectively. There was little change in the relative

shares of domestic and foreign resources.With regard to utilisation of resources, consumptionabsorbed 58 per cent, with a growth of 4.9 per cent, in realterms. This indicates a deceleration of the growth inconsumption, as consumption grew in real terms by 6,6 per cent

and 6.2 per cent respectively, in the past two years, Resourcesutilisation for fixed capital fbrmation, in real terms, grew by12.3 per cent in 2004 reflecting a continuation of investmentactivities, but at a somewhat lower growth rate than in 2003.Resources utilisation for export of goods and non-factorservices grew at a higher rate compared with the -qrowthrecorded in 2003, reflecting the recovety in world demand. The

growth in investment expenditure improved the share of capitalformation from 16.5 per cent to 17.3 per cent, at the cost of the

consumption share. This was a welcome development, as therelative share of capital formation had deterioratedcontinuously in the past thee years compared with the level

Savings

Domestic savings, which include both private and _qovernmentsavings, were estimated at Rs 323 billion, an increase of 15.2per cent over the previous year. This increase was solely dueto the improvement in private savings by 18.5 per cent. Theimpetus for the _qrowth of private sector savings was providedby the increased corporate sector savin_qs, in the context ofhigher profitability. Public sector dis-savin-es, which hadimproved during the previous two years. deteriorated in 2004,reflecting the increase in government recurrent expenditure.

The increase in private sector savings was more than sufficient

to offiet the increase in public sector dis-savings. However, thedomestic savin-qs ratio (domestic savings/GDP) remained at the

same level, 15.9 per cent.Nationalsavin-qs, the sum of domestic savings, net forei_enprivate transfers and NFIA increased by 15.9 per cent to Rs 439billion. As the -qrowth of national savings was parallel with thatof GDP at market prices, the national savin,{s ratio (nationalsavings/GDP) remainedat2l.6 per cent. NFIA continued to benegative, and deteriorated further to Rs 20.7 billion with theincrease in interest payments. However, net private transfers,which consists of workers remittances, improved at a higherrate to Rs. 137 billion, thereby completely mitigating thenegative impact of the deterioration in NFIA. Net privatetransfers currently account for around 7 per cent of GDP.2.5 lssues and Policies

Over the past f'ew decades, inconsistent and ad- hoc chan_ees intrade policy have continuously been a major constraint forinvestment expansion and development of the Agriculturesector. Even in 2004, the trade policy on certain agriculturalcommodities was revised several times with the two objectivesof reducing the cost of living and providin_q protection to

farmers, which are difficult to achieve simultaneously. Specificimport duties on key food items had been reduced and later

raised, or vice versa. These decisions gave conflicting signalsto the market, both producers and importers, while theirinappropriate timin,e created price pressure and supplyshortfalls. A major requirement tor the development of theagriculture sector is to have a market oriented, consistent andwell-specified, long-term trade policy in place, which will not

distort the short-term supply situation due to ad-hoc tariff

chan_tes, at a cost to both producers and consumers. Ad-hoctrade policies, in tact, often harm the groups which are targetedto be supported, in the long run.The issue of govemment interventions through subsidiesto certain sectors and market interventions by the means ofsuaranteed prices to others has been long debated in Sri Lanka.A f-ertiliser subsidy could encourage otherwise unprofitableeconomic activities, thus creatin_q ne_sative value added to theoverall economy. A subsidy on one type of fertiliser (eg: Urea),distorts the cost structure of inputs and encourages t'armers touse subsidised fertiliser intensely, though inappropriately, thuslowering the A_qriculture sector total factor productivity. Thegovernment's intervention in the market as a purchasing a_eentwith a guaranteed price for selected agricultural crops impactson farmers' decisions on what to produce and distorts market

si-enals that finally lead to ineffrcient resource allocation in theAgriculture sector. Further, these activities, not only createfiscal burdens that cannot be sustained in the long run, but alsodiscourage development of private sector agriculturalprocessing, packa_{in_e and storage activities which providebenefits to both producers and consumers. In 2004 too, the

_qovernment continued to provide such subsidies and intervenein the market to purchase paddy at fixed prices. The totalf'ertiliser subsidy commirment increased to Rs. 5.3 billion in2004 trom an initial allocation of Rs.2.0 billion in the Budget.At the same time, revenue was also lost with the removal of theVAT on f'ertiliser from July 2004to further cushion the farmerfrom the impact of input prices. Such policies ,qain popularsupport, although their potential distortionary impact on theeconomy through their short-term and long-term ef'fects on

both revenue and expenditure are not always clearly understood

by the stakeholders. It is important to raise public awareness ofsuch trade-offs for the stakeholders, so that decisions takencould be of optimum beneflt to the economy as a whole.In the aftermath of the Tsunami disaster and its adverseimpact on the fishing sector, the NFPC would need to reviewtheir recent policy proposals, usinq the disaster as anopportunity to restructure and rebuild the fisheries industry into

a modem and dynamic sector that would provide sustainableincomes to the fishin-e community while improvin-q theaffordability of fishing products to the consumer, through

enhanced productivity.In summary, the performance of the Agriculture sectorin the recent past clearly shows that the technological and

research driven improvement in a-Qriculture which has taken

place in fast developin-q countries, has not been takin-q placein Sri Lanka, irrespective of substantial human capital

employed in research and development relating to agriculture.The inevitable result has been that the country's centuriesold a-ericulture concentration and specialisation have not gonethrough a structural change, limiting Sri Lanka's

specialisation to a f'ew crops. The prominence of paddy, tea,rubber, coconut and a ferv other field crops, which are

subject to vagaries of weather, poor water management,archaic land laws and international commodity prices,

increases producer risks and reduces their income. Theresultant need for ad-hoc and short-term government

intervention in securing income and providing subsidies for

the sector causes major detrimental effects to the economy,

especially in the sphere of fiscal consolidation. Furthermore,

sector specific incentives and subsidies brin-e in uneven and

distortionary developments in the Agriculture sector as wellas the economy as a whole. In fact, despite considerablegovernment resources flowin.{ into the sector sinceIndependence, and with a large public sector workforce

supportin-e agricultural research and extension services, thegrowth rate in the sector has been volatile and fluctuating

around a low average for over 50 years. Althou-eh around30-35 per cent of the employed work force are in theAgriculture sector, the CFS 2003104 recorded that only oneper cent of the unemployed wished for employment in this

sector. In fact, labour productivity (GDP per employee) in

the Agriculture is less than half that in the other two sectors

and falls well below the national average. Consequently, the

other two sectors have grown at a faster pace and contributedsignificantly more to the economy in recent decades. The

Agriculture sector will continue to operate below the desired

level, unless a rational, clear, consistent policy is developedand implemented to move away frorn traditional rnethods,to a modern, sustainable growth path that would focus onproductivity improvements and address cunent limitationsin the availability of land and water, and provide adequateincomes to the a-ericultural worker, while competing withinternational markets to enable affordable products to

consumers. In this context, the necessity for addressing key

issues and establishing clear policies relating to the land

market, water mana-qement and utilisation, seed procurement,extension services, subsidies and tariff cannot be

underestimated. Else, even the present supply of labour and

investment in the Agriculture sector would move elsewhere.

There exists an urgent need for raising productivity andyields to make Sri Lanka's a-{riculture competitive with thatin other countries. The fundamental research conducted has

generated some innovations, but Sri Lanka's neighbouring

countries have moved much faster ahead in this field, raising

the yield levels of many crops in those countries much higher

than in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka should also follow a pragmaticapproach in raisin-e productivity by adoptin-e already

developed technology and research elsewhere in the world.

Despite recent achievements, the Industnal sector suff'ersfrom several impediments. Amon-u them are insuffrcient skilled

human capital, inadequate infrastructure facilities, high cost ofenergy, insufficient progress in restructurin-e public sector

enterprises, labour market ri-eidity and the absence of proper

bankruptcy le-eislation. Some regulations in certain activities,such as time-consuming reporting requirements and

burdensome approval procedures, have increased business

transaction costs. The long delays in court proceedings,

complexity of existing laws and lack of adequate commercial

courts in the country have increased liti-eation costs. Althou-eh

amendments were made to several labour laws in 2W3, towardsimprovin-e flexibility in the labour market, activeimplementation of key amendments remains uncertain. Inparticular, although a new formula for computation of the

compensation payment for laying off of workers was finalisedin March 2005, its potential impact on future investment

remains under debate, particularly among employers. The

environmental pollution created by industrial waste and the

lack of proper legal provisions to protect the environment, are

also becoming causes for concern.Furthermore, provincial GDP estimates show that 50to 60 per cent of industrial sector activity is concentrated inthe Western province, with an even higher share of

investment in industry concentrated there. There is an urgent

need to geographically diversify industrial location to reduceexisting regional disparities in employment and income

generating opportunities for a sustainable high growth in this

sector. Against this background, existin-e impediments to the

Industry Sector need to be removed if Sri Lanka is to moveto a hi,eher growth path.The Services sector has been the driving force behind

economic growth in the recent past. Labour productivity hasbeen highest in this sector, more than double that ina-{riculture. In particular, sectors such as'external trade,

telecommunications, port services, hotels and restaurants, andpersonal services such as private education, health,advertising and business services have been growing inresponse to the demand arising from rising consumerincomes and changing preferences. Many of these sectors

have grown healthily under market forces. In fact, followingon liberalisation and the move away fiom state monopoliesof key sectors such as potts, telecommunications and evenimport trade, those sectors have shown dynamism,

respondin,e well to market forces. Perhaps it is [imely tolearn from such positive lessons of the recent past in the

Services sector. A review of the state's role in the successof certain economic activities clearly signals a need to limitits involvement to a facilitatory role and allow market forces

and the private sector to drive the growth in all sectors, while

ensuring that the legal framework and regulatory provisionsare in place to safe-euard national priorities such as the

environment, public health, public safety, national security,law and order that would create an environment conduciveto sustainable economic growth.In 2004, per capita income surpassed US dollars 1,000(Sri Lanka rupees 100,000) for the first time in history.

Though the per capita income at national level has exceededthis banier, the disparity in the provincial income distribution

raises concerns. Accordin-e to provincial GDP estimates foryear 2003 disseminated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka(Statistical Appendix Table 3), the Western Province alone

claims 45 per cent of the total GDP, while the Northern,Eastern, Uva and Sabaragamuwa provinces emerqe as thepoorest provinces. In thct, the provincial disaggregationshows that only the Western Province has exceeded the percapita threshold of US dollars 1,000 and the per capitaincomes in some provinces are still below the US dollars500 level. The hi,eh concentration of economic activity inthe Western Province does not au-qur well, even fbr theWestern Province, as risin_e population, environmentalconcerns and related problems undermine the economicachievements in the province. Therefore, attention to thisissue is critical, as these regional disparities not only affectthe achievement of high overall economic growth directly,but also indirectly, through their potential impact on socialand political stability in the country.The response of the economy to the environment createdby the ceasefire agreement since early 2002, first in terms ofconsumer confidence and later, investor confidence, clearly

emphasised the potential for growth in the country. Two criticalareas need further improvement, in order to achieve thispotential. First, the current level of investment needs to riseeven further towards capacity expansion, Second, overallproductivity needs to improve towards most efficient use of

scarce resources. Given the low domestic savings rate, foreign

int'lows would be critically needed to tinance high investment.Therefore it is imperative that the investment climate remainsbuoyant. In fact, although the increase in investment in 2004was a welcome development, the investment ratio was farbelow the investment of about 30 per cent of GDP required toachieve a desirable annual _qrowth of over 8 per cent.Achievement of such a hi_eh level of investment will ultimately

depend on a number of f actors that raise investor confidence.Securin_e a lasting peace to the civil conflict, speedyimplementation of reforms to remove structural impediments,prudent macro-economic management including greater fiscal

di sci pl i ne, poli tical stab il i ty, i mproved infrastructure faci li ties,particularly power and roads, and reducin_e economic policyuncertainties will be the crucial factors that enhance the futurepotential of the economy.

The Tsunami disaster had the goodwill of the entire worldat Sri Lanka's door. Out of such a hurnan tra_qedy the country

has been given an opportunity to build bridges among ethnic,religious, political and private vs. state factions and to unite torestructure and rebuild. A clear policy commitment that wouldmaintain the investor confidence that grew from the ceasefireis critically needed at this juncture, if yet another opportunityto move Sri Lanka onto a higher and sustainable _{rowth pathis not to be missed again.
