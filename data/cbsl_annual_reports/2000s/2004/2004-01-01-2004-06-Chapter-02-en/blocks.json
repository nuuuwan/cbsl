The negative contribution ofthe Agriculture sector was due to dry weather in certaindistricts that affected paddy and coconut cultivation, althoughsome domestic agriculture sub-sectors performed well, withfarmers switching to less water intensive crops than paddyto make optimum use of the available water resources.On the expenditure fiont, GDP at current market priceswas estimated at Rs. 2,029 billion in 2004, recording anincrease of 15.2 per cent. This higher rate of increase, despitea deceleration in real economic growth, was more due tothe increase in the general price level. The overall priceinf-lation as measured by the GDP deflator was 9.2 per cent,in comparison to 5 per cent recorded in 2003, The higherincrease in the deflator was explained by the increases inpublic sector wages and international prices of intermediategoods such as petroleum products and other raw materials,and the depleciation of the Sri Lanka rupee by around 5per cent, on average, against the US Dollar.

Ille_eal prawn farmin_swithout adherin_e to environmental re_eulations could lead topollution and spreadin_u of diseases, which has been thecommon cause of production losses. The Bud_eet 2005 hasallocated funds for immediate infrastructure rehabilitation workand environmental protection in this sector.The frsheries sector was severely affected by the Tsunamitidal waves that hit two third of the coastline of the island. Itis estimated that nearly 80 per cent of active fishermen wereaff-ected and more than 75 per cent of the fishing fleet wasdestroyed or damaged by the Tsunami. In addition, a largenumber of small-scaie fishin,e craft and fishin_e gear weredestroyed. Of the 12 fishing harbours, l0 were severelydamaqed, includin_e breakrvaters, buildings, machinery andequipment. In addition, public and private utilities such as iceplants, Ianding ports, markets, and houses of the fishingcommunity were destroyed.

The competitivenessin exports was facilitated by the improvement in productivity,rationalisation of production costs and depreciation of theexchange rate.
