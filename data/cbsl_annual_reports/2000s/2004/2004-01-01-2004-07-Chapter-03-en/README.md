ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

3.1 Overview

The basic ingredients of stable economic and socialinfrastructure development, which _eenerates rapid economicgrowth are efficient institutions, effective re_{ulation, properpricing, adequate investment and precise targeting, Inaddition to being a necessary condition for rapid grolth, awell-developed system of infrastructure generates a seriesof tradable services and supports poverty alleviation byincreasing access to both input and output markets.Therefore, failure to support continuous infrastructuredevelopment not only inhibits ,erowth and poverty alleviation,but also generates an undesirable outcome by shitiingdemand fr<lm services consumed domestically to services

consumed abroad such as in the case of health and education.Three decades ago, infrastructure facilities were mostlysupplied and regulated by the government, although mostof these facilities could have been supplied more efticientlyby the private sector. These facilities were not appropriatelypriced and targeted, leadin-e to over consumption, anincreased fiscal burden, an improper allocation of resourcesand the failure to continue with the required rate of publicinvestment in infrastructure development.With the economic liberalisation since 1917, theprovision of infrastructure facilities has been reformedgradually to meet the rapidly expanding demand with therealisation by successive governments of the difficulties inpursuing an adequate public investment programme. Theseinclude difficulties in enhancin-e efficiency in the civil serviceand difficulties in pursuing proper pricing and targetingmechanisms free from political interferences. The reformmeasures included removing or relaxing entry barriers,outsourcing management, encuragin_e public-privatepartnerships, privatisation, refining pricin,q strategies,establishin-{ re-{ulatory authorities, improving welfaretar-{eting and reforming the civil service.In line with the Economic Policy Framework of theGovernment of Sri Lanka (EPF-GOSL), further pro_qress was

made in economic and social infrastructure development andreform, in 2004. Public sector institutions providinginfrastructure facilities were subject to institutional reforms,

the coverage of intiastructure was widened and policies were

stren-Rthened.Several institutions supplying economic services were

brou-eht under the Strategic Enterprise Mana_qement A_qency(SEMA) established in2004 to improve their efficiency. Thesewere the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), the Ceylon

Electricity Board (CEB), the Sri Lanka Ports Authority(SLPA), the Sri Lanka Railways (SLR), the Airport andAviation Authority of Sri Lanka (AAASL), the Sri LankaCentral Transport Board (SLCTB) and the Cluster BusCompanies (CBCs), and the National Water Supply andDrainage Board (NWSDB). The financial performance of all

these enterprises, except the SLPA had deteriorated in the past

and continues to deteriorate in the absence of a proper reformpro-qramme. The widespread chronic sicknesses of suchpublicly held giants could even threaten the macroeconomicstability of the country, considering their strategic importancein the national economy in view of the services they produce.The key recommendations made by the PresidentialTask Force (PTF) on Health in 1997 continued to beimplemented, focussin-e on improvin_t healthcare reach,promoting awareness, reforming the organizational structure,developing alternative financing mechanisms andencoura-eing private-public cooperation. Furthermore,multifarious refbrms and developments rvere brou_eht underthe National Health Development Master Plan that wasdesigned with the cooperation of Japan InternationalCoorporation Agency (JICA) in October 2003.In the education sector, the recent wave of reforms that

be-ean in 1998 have been primarily targeting the improvementof education infrastructure, quality and service delivery atall levels. These efforts were further strengthened byimplementing the 'Navodya Schools Programmeme' in 2004,aiming at providin,e greater educational opportunities to thestudents in remote areas.Infrastructure services showed a mixed performance in2004. Telecommunications and port services continued toexpand, while the electricity sector suffered from the lackof new investment, the drought and high international oilprices. Passen,{er transportation operated by the state orvnedbus companies and the Sri Lanka Railways indicated afurther weakening during 2004, but privately managed

passen_qer transport services expanded. Air transportationrevived with the expansion of the tourism industry, therecovery in the rvorld aviation industry, expansion of servicesto new destinations and reforms introduced to the aviationsector in the recent past. Port services displayed a strong

-qrowth, supported by increased domestic and internationaltrade, improved productivity and effective marketin_e. Thehousing market further expanded, largely benefiting from thelow interest rate re-eime that fbllowed from the improvedmacroeconomic performance, Althou,eh the provisions in the

Welfale Benefit Act were not yet implemented, the numberof Samurdhi beneficiaries declined due to better tar-ueting

and various income enhancement pro-erammes.The much needed reforms in respect of infrastructureare yet to be completed, rvhile public investment in this

regard is not satisfactory. Hence, the infiasttucture facilities

have failed to keep pace with the developments in the restof the world, let alone with some of the fast grorvin-e Asianeconomies. This has led to serious supply shorta-ees and

regional disparities in roads, electricity, telecommunications,transportation and water supply as well as in health and

education facilities. The pricing of services does not coverthe cost of production, rendering major infrastructureinstitutions to depend on continued budgetary support liomthe government. Independent regulatory mechanisms arelacking in many sectors and the available mechanisms are

weak or ineffective. Public health care is saddled with labour

disputes, insufficient investment and improper targeting. As

a result, the population at large is prone to deadly epidemics

costing valuable human lives and deterioratin-e the economic

environment. The educational services have produced serious

mismatches between their output and market needs, and havenot been able to -qenerate and retain the required humancapital needed for rapid economic development.The overall pool quality of economic and socialinfrastructure is manifested in several weaknesses. SriLanka's ranking of international competitiveness is low,undermining its strategic advantages of bein-9 close to major

sea routes, having a hi,eh level of literacy, being an islandand havin-e liberal economic policies. Many essential

services, such as healthcare and education are being obtained

abroad by Sri Lankans, although the country has the potentialto convert them into si-unificant foreign exchan-9e earners.

Progress beyond the basic social infrastructure is neccessaryfor the country to be internationally competitive in socialinfrastructure services. In the absence of proper pricing,natural resources such as water are being exploited, in an

unsustainable manner, leading to the ailment known as the

'tra-tedy of the commons'.' Therefore, a renewed effort hasto be put in place to introduce the necessary reforms in thedevelopment of infrastructure, so that they could contributeto sustainable economic growth, while generating a seriesof competitive and tradable services.

3.2 Economic Infrastructure Policies,Institutional Set up and Performance

Commun ications ServicesThe two major communications services are the

telecommunications and postal service. The refbrms introduced

since 1980s has made Sri Lanka's telecommunications sector

one of the most liberal and fast -erowing sectors in the country.In contrast, the postal service continued to deteriorate in the

absence of such a reform programme, increasing the fiscal

burden and threatenin-{ its own lon-e-term sustainability. This

draws to the immediate attention that reforms in the postal

sector can not be further delayed, for otherwise it would losethe opportunity of benefitin-q from the advancement in

information and communications technolo-9y.In the case of telecommunications services, a significant

competition exists among the 77 licensed telecom operators.2

However, at the same time, there is significant pent-up demand

for their services. In2004. the telecommunications sector, in

terms of subscriber network, expanded by 36 per cent. The

1 Political philosophers and economists have understood that il citizens respond

only lo private incentives, public goods will be under provided and public re-

sources over utilized. An illustration shows that if common grazing lands are

opened to farmers, catlle could have a healthy growth and grazing land is nol

hurt, il only a few catlle are sent lor grazing. However, unregulated access lo

common grazing land will result in excessive use of the land and cattle being

underfed. Thus, well placed and the right degree of regulations may protect the

rights and resolve conllicting interests of the diverse groups in sociely, accel-

erate economic growth, increase social welfare, ensure equilable distribution

and protect natural resources and the environment. Still, such regulations need

revision from time to time, and specially when the market players feel hindered

or inhibited in a manner that restricts growth and development. (CBSL Annual

Report 2001, Box 4).

mobile telephone operators dominated the market with a shareof 6l per cent. The use of cellular telephones increased

remarkably by.59 per cent in 2004 over the previous year.

The external _eateway operation, lvhich was the monopolyof Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT), was opened for competition in2003 with 32 licences bein-u -eranted by end 2004. As a result,

Intemational Direct Dialling (IDD) call charges have declinedsignificantly and volumes have increased. The ten digit'numberin-{ system which was introduced in 2003 to

accommodate the increasing demand for telecommunications

services, in line with re_sional and international standards, wascompleted by early 2004. The Calling Party Pays (CPP)

system, which was to be implemented from March 2004, was

postponed due to unresolved issues on CPP char,ees. The CPPsystem would have stimulated further growth in thetelecommunications sector as rvitnessed in India and Pakistan.and would have promoted telecommunications services inrural aleas. The next wave of liberalization mainly focussin_eon strengthenin-B regulations and improving competition as

envisaged in the new National Telecommunications Policyapproved by the Cabinet in November 2002, is still being

awaited.Although there is a wide disparity between the urban andrural sectors rvith regards to the availability oftelecommunications facilities, it is in proportion to the extent

of economic activities in the two sectors. Out of the total fixed

access telephones (wire lines) 44 per cent was in the Colombometropolitan area by end 2004. With a view to enhancingtelecommunications facilities in rural areas, Thetelecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka(TRCSL) is operating a subsidy scheme to encoura_9e theinstallation of payphones in rural areas. Accordingly, 260

payphones have been installed under this scheme by end 2A04.In addition, the TRCSL is also implementing a project toprovide telecommunications facilities to 590 rural sub-postoffices. A pilot pro-qramme was completed in the Monaragaladistrict by providing telephone facilities to 4l sub-post offlces.Several telecommunications projects were in progress in2004 to improve telecommunications facilities in the country.The SEA-ME-WE-IV (South East Asia -Middle East -WestEurope-IV) submarine cable project, in which SLT is the localpartner, is expected to be commissioned in 2005 with l5 otherinternational partners. This would enhance the quality and thebandwidth of Sri Lanka's telecommunications system. SLTinvested Rs. 6.5 billion in various projects in2004 to improve

the efficiency and to expand its capacity.Given the high level of literacy in Sri Lanka, there is agreat potential fbr further developing infbrmation technolo-eybased activities such as telemarketin-e, call centtes, dataprocessin-e and internet based products, if necessaryinfrastructure facilities are sufficiently made available atcompetitive prices.

The postal service is increasin-ely being challenged by therapid developments in information and communication

and internet services, the international express mail sen,ice(EMS), the local speed post service, post fax service and

electronic money order services. Flowever, the total operatin_eexpenditure of the DOP grerv sli.ehtly to Rs 3,356 million,exceeding its revenue. Consequently, its operating loss

amounted to Rs. 971 million in2004, exceedin-e the budgeted

target of Rs. 297 million.A salient t'eature of the postal services has been avowedhostility a-eainst any type of refbrms in the sector by the labourunions. This is presumably because of the fear of losin-eemployment. But this fear will soon be a reality, unless the

sector makes an early ef'fort to chan-ee itself in line with therapidly changing market and technolo-eical developments.

Economic history is abundant with examples of such painful

episodes, which are unavoidable in any modernisation process,

unless the threatened sector modernises itself.

Energy

The major source of energy in SriLanka is the bio-mass (48 per

cent), used mostly by households and, on a limited scale, in the

proce ssing of plantation crops. i:lo wever, the mostcommercially intensive energy sources are electricity and

petroleum. Both of these sources are subjei:t to shocks, makin.e

Sri Lanka's economy vulnerabile. Hence, serious reforms are

necessary toachieve the required degree of resilience.Electricityz In 2004, the electricity sector suffered fiomthe twin shocks of the drou-eht and hi-ch petroleum prices,which increased cost of production. The unchanged prices in

such a scenario led to a deterioration in the financial positionof the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), requiring greater

budgetary support. Parallel to these adverse developments, thedelays in implementin-e nerv plants, proposed reforms and

measures to address the high system losses compounded its

woes, threatening its long-term sustainability.

The problems in the electricity sector emanatin*{ from the

insutflcient generatin-r capacity were further a-qgravated by the

drought which lowered the reservoir watc:r levels down to l5

per cent in the flrst half', before improving moderately later. Sri

Lanka needs to increase the power -eenerating capacity by over'l0 per cent annually to meet the growin-q demand for electricity

to achieve the anticipated medium term economic growth rateof above 6 per cent. The total installed capacity increased by

135 MW (6 per cent) to 2,358 MW, with the commissionin,e of

The l{eladhanavi thermal power plant in 2004.In addition, the

private sector owned mini-hydropower plants added 35 MW in

2004. These developments chan-9ed the installed capacity of

hydro:thermal ratio to 54:46 in 2004.In the medium term, the generation capacity rvill be

expanded by about 400 MW, rvith the establishment of several

new power plants. The diesel power plant of 100 MW bein-e

constructed at Embilipitiya is expected to be operational by

May 2005, while a 'Combined Cycle' Gas Turbine project rvith

Despite the low hydropower generation, total electricity

the non-implementation of low cost,large-scale power sources,such as coal power, has led to a high electricity tariff andfrequent power shortages. These shortages have prompted boththe CEB and consumers to l'esort to hi_eh cost small capacityalternative sources. This is uneconomical in a sector, whichdisplays diminishing marginal costs with the increasing levelof production, thus favourin-e high capacity plants,

The cost of polver generation increased in2004 due toshort-term measures taken to meet power shortages by hiring

emer-qency power plants as well as other inefficieitcies such asthe still hi-eh system losses. The transfer of this high cost to

consumers has also been discouraged by the already high tariffrates in Sri Lanka compared with its competitor countries3.However, it is noteworthy that, while transferring the increasedcost to consumers in the short run, measures should be takento rectify the existin.e inefficiencies in the production ofelectricity. For otherwise, the public at large would be calledupon to bear the burden created by institutional and policyinefficiencies.

The CEB retains the monopoly power over transmissionand together with its subsidiary, Lanka Electricity CompanyLtd, (LECO), enjoys monopoly in distribution. The share of

gene ration by CEB in2004 was over 65 per cent. However, inthe absence of tariff revisions and measures to eliminateinefficiencies, its financial position furlher deteriorated in2004,

Ieading to increased short-term borrowings, delaying its debt

service payments to the govemment and raising concems aboutthe viability of the institution.A series of reforms were suggested in the Electricity

Sector Reforms Act passed in2002 to address the inefficienciesin the sector and adequate donor support is available toimplement them. The proposed reforms focus mainly on thedere-{ulation of the sector and unbundling, the main activitiesof the CEB, i.e.. -eeneration, transmission and distribution,Under these proposed reforms, the power sector was to be

re-eulated by the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka

However, the reforms did notmaterialise in 2004 and the CEB was brought under thepurview of SEMA, the authority lesponsible fbr camying outfuture refbrms in public enterprises.Petroleum: The petroleum sector experienced a majorinternational price shock in 2004. The avera_ee internationalcrude oil price (Brent) has increased by 35 per cent in 2004over 2003. The delays and inadequate adjustments in prices led

to a continued increase in domestic consumption of fuel, raising

the losses incuned by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC)

and Lanka IOC Ltd. (LIOC). This led to both an increase in

the subsidy payments by the government and a deterioration inthe BOP position. Meanwhile, making matters worse, thirdplayer in distribution did not enter the market as planned,

thereby adding to financin-e difficulties of the bud-eet. Its entrycould have improved competition further, with furtherimprovement in the quality of service of petroleum distribution.The value of petroleum imports increased by 44 per centin 2004 to US dollars l,2ll million from US dollars 838million in 2003 reflecting a 28 per cent increase in price and a9 per cent increase in volume. However, as stated earlier,

despite the rapidly rising intemational prices, the domestic fuelprices were not adjusted upward as per the pricin,q formulaintroduced in January 2002, except on a few occasions. Petrolprices were raised by Rs 8.00 per litre in July 2004, aftel a lagof six months. Petrol and diesel plices rvere further raised byRs 3.00 and Rs 4.00 per litre, respectively, in August 2004.Diesel and petrol prices were raised again in two parts,applicable to Colombo city limit and outside in Septermber

2004. The price of diesel within Colombo city limits was raisedby Rs.8 per litre and outside by Rs.6 per litre, while the priceof petrol was raised only within Colombo city limits by Rs.2per litre. However, the price of kerosene was not raised sinceJanuary 2004. These revisions were not sufficient to cover thelosses of the CPC in an environment of rising internationalprices. This has exerted a significant financial strain on theCPC, tying it to an unhealthy'debt trap'. As a result, the

-qovernment had to bear a lar-ee subsidy obligation to ihe CPC

and LIOC, amountin-9 to Rs. 18 billion (about 0.9 per cent of

the GDP), adversely aft'ecting the budgetary performance and,

hence, imposing an unjustified burden unproportionately on the

non-users of petroleum products. This is evident from the factthat the prices of kerosene and diesel in Sri Lanka aresubstantially lower than those in India, Bangladesh andPakistan by end 2004.

The demand fbr major petroleum products increased by l0

per cent in2004. compared to the I per cent increase in 2003,mainly due to the high demand fbr diesel and furnace oil for

thermal power,{eneration. The growth of petrol consumption,however, decelarated to 15 per cent in 2004 from 35 per centin the previous year, mostly in response to the petrol price

increase of 28 per cent durin-{ the year, despite an increase in

the vehicle fleet. However, the demand for diesel increased byabout 14 pel cent in contrast to a drop of 5 per cent in 2003,

entirely due to its increased use for thermal power generation.

The demand for kerosene declined by I per cent, mainly dueto the decline in demand for lighting purposes with the

expansion in electricity distribution, althou-eh the price of

kerosene remained unchanged during the year.The second distributor, LIOC, which commenced

operations in Sri Lanka in March 2003, continued to expand its

operations throughout the country through 170 filling stations.

In addition, another I07 tilling stations owned by the CPC have

been earmarked for a third player, to enhance the competition

in distribution. Meanwhile, in terms of government policy, theactivities of the CPC were brought under SEMA with the

objective of enhancin-e the operational efficiency.

The high cost of bunkerin-e fuel has been discouraging

the t-leet of vessels aniving at Colombo for bunkerin-s. The

privatisation of Lanka Marine Services Ltd has not yielded the

required low prices and competition, indicating the need for

further reforms in this sectol',

As in the postal sector, the or-eanised labour in the ener-qy

sector appears to be bent on a protest campai,en against any typeof reforms in the two public corporations involved. The

weakening financial conditions of both the CEB and the CPC

could drive them to virtual insolvency with an accumulation of

debt obligations to the bankin-q sector. While price revisions

would enable them to cut current Iosses, recapitalisation is

needed to ensure long-term solvency, The protest campaigns

would have been motivated by a t-ear of losing employment, butdelaying the needed reforms would hasten that feared

eventuality, in addition to passing a burden to the taxpayers to

rescue the two enterprises. A frank dialogue among all

stakeholders involved is a must to reach a consensus for

reforms and mapping out a way fbrward programme.

Transportation

The transportation network comprising land, sea and

waterways and air transportation constitutes a vital part of the

economic infiastructure. The efficiency of the transportationnetwork determines, to a large extent, the degree of

productivity, speed in delivery, the level of safety and finally,

the competitiveness of the nation.In Sri Lanka, land transportation is the dominant mode ofinternal transportation. The sea and waterways are being

scarcely used for internal transpofiation. Air transportation is

now becoming a popular mode of internal transportation with

the improvement in the security situation.

Sri Lanka enjoys a comparative advantage in international

marine transportation, largely due to its strategic location.

However, the competitiveness of the country depends lar-eely

on the etficiency of the port services and how well the internal

transportation network is Iinked with the internal transportationnetwork. Air transportation has been hindered by internationalprotection via landing ri_uhts. The new civil aviationliberalisation policies could lead to greater efficiency in airtransportation, thereby Sri Lanka becomin,{ a hub forairtransportation in the re_eion.

Road Transportation

Road Development: Although the coverage of Sri Lanka's

road network is adequate by international standards, the qualityof its roads needs substantial improvements. The majorproblems associated with road development in Sri Lanka havebeen the excessive delay in implementing planned roadprojects, inability to secure sufficient funds needed for new

road projects and the lack of fundin-e for the maintenance of theexisting road network. To address the issue of the lack of funds,

the Budget 2003 proposed to establish a Road Fund through theimposition of a specific levy of Rs 1.00 on petrol and Rs.0.50on diesel, per litre, respectively. However, the fund has not yetbeen set up, as proposed, though the levy has been enforced.The lack of funds can be resolved by raising funds from thecapital market and encoura-eing BOO/BOT anangements aswell as introducing revenue generating systems.The improvement in quality is hindered by the lack offunds for road expansion and maintenance, a general issue

associated with Sri Lanka's poor budgetary conditions. Owingto the general bud_eetary constraints, priority is given to othermore urgent needs, thereby pushin,e road development andmaintenance to the backstage. Flence, addressin_{ the issues inthis sector pre-requires the implementing of the budgetaryreforms.The Road Development Authority (RDA) mainrainsI1,661 kilometres of national roads (A and B classes) md4,429bridges. It spent Rs. I 1,199 million in 2004, a marginal declineover 2003 for maintenance, rehabilitation and reconstruction ofnational roads. Of the total expenditure, Rs. 4,942 million andRs. l,2l I million were spent on rehabilitation of the existin_e

road network and routine maintenance, respectively, while Rs.1,833 million rvas spent on new construction. Provincial andlocal governments maintain about 15,000 and 75,000kilometres of provincial roads (C and D classes) and local roads(E class), respectively. The issue of the lack of funds is more

severe in local and provincial governments which has led to alow level of rural and provincial road maintenance.To develop the road netlort, the RDA was engaged in theimplementation of several forei-en funded projects coveringnew construction of major highways, rehabilitation of roadsand takin-e measures to reduce road con_eestion. The SouthernHighway proJect was in progless at an estimated cost of Rs, 29billion funded separately by the Asian Development Bank(ADB) and Japanese Bank for International Cooperation(JBIC). The construction work of the ADB funded section ofthe Southern Highway (Kurundu_eahahetekma - Godagama),commenced in early 2003 and is expected to be

completed by 2006. The JBIC funded section (Kottawa -Kurundu,eahahetekma) is scheduled to be commenced in 2005.

The proposed Colombo-Kat un ay ake expressway proj ect, whi ch

was commenced in 2000 and later suspended, is planned to be

recommenced on a Public Private Partnership (PPP) basis. TheColombo Outer Circular Highrvay with an estimated project

cost of around Rs. l7 billion is at the stage of completing thesurvey map. The Colombo- Kandy expressway is expected tobe implemented on a BOT basis with the assistance of theMalaysian government at an estimated cost of Rs. 29 billion.the RDA also implemented the Road Network ImprovementProject (RNIP), which includes the rehabilitation of 345kilometres of roads and the improvement of 47 brid_ees with theassistance of the ADB and JBIC. During the year, therehabilitation and improvement of the Balangoda -Bandarawela road with Korean assistance were alsocommenced.To address the problem of road congestion in Colombo

and its suburbs, the RDA has identifred a number of projects,including the Marine Drive Project, the Duplication RoadProject and flyovers at Nugegoda, Gampaha, Pannipitiya and

Oru-eodawatta, but all of these projects have been delayed dueto bud-eetary constraints. Under the 'Masa Ne*guma'programme, several rural roads were improved at a cost of Rs.

57 million in 2004, but this was inadequate, compared with therequirements. Several other road improvement projects wereimplemented with local funds.Several road sections in the Western, Southem, Eastern

and Northem coastal belt of the country were severely damageddue to the tsunami. The reconstruction cost of damaged roads

and brid-ses has been estimated at Rs. 1,035 million.It is time for Sri Lanka to look at a new model of roaddevelopment, departing from the current method of providing

fundin-e through the budget or by the donors. Road usage could

be made to be paid by the users, so that the continued relianceon the bud-eet for funding could be avoided. The users,especially in the urban centres, have been hit by the slowmovement of traftic owing to road con_eestions caused by thenon-development of the road network to meet the demand. Theproblem is becoming acute day by day and much valuableworker-hours are being lost to the nation.Road Passenger Transportation : The road passengertransportation provided by private bus operators and cluster buscompanies contributes approximately 80 per cent of the totalpassenger transportation in Sri Lanka. The remainder iscontributed by Sri Lanka Railways (7 per cent) and privatevehicle owners (13 per cent). The quality of road passengertransportation showed no significant improvement in 2004 andthe shortcomings prevailing during the last few decadescontinued to loom large. Inadequate service. poor quality and

an increasing number of accidents were the weaknesses in thepublic road transport service, In addition, the cluster buscompanies (CBCs) suffered from a lack of buses, deteriorationof revenue, cost escalation due to the excessive work force.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 200465

Part IChapter 3 - ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

inadequate working capital and low investment. As a result,

CBCs were runnin-q at a lar-ee loss, making them dependent on

government asslstance.ln terms of the national bus fares policy, fares were raised

by an avera-qe rate of 9 per cent in September 2004 with the

increase in the price of diesel by Rs.4.00 per litre and the

escalation of other costs of operation. Bus fares were raised

again by an avera-qe rate of 6 per cent from October 2004 as theprice of diesel was raised by Rs.6.00 per litre in September2004. The government's control of bus fares appears to have

been made for protecting commuters, but the very same

protection has done more harm to them, by way of discomfort,

elon-eated travel time, high exposure to risk of accident and a

general reduction in productivity. A liberal bus fhre policy thatautomatically takes into account cost increases should be put

in place to ensure the lon-e-term sustainability of the sector.In May 2004, the Cabinet approved the Ministry ofTransport's strate-eic action plan, which covers all major

aspects of passen-eer and goods transportation. The plan

includes the preparation of effective time tables, provision oftraining to staff and bus crew, building 1,000 bus stands,

The government's attempts to restructure CBCs on several

occasions in the past have failed. In 2004, CBCs were brou-uht

under the purview of SEMA.

Railrvay Transportation: At present, Sri Lanka Railways(SLR) contributes around 7 per cent and 2 per cent,

respectively, of the public passenger transportation and goods

transportation in the country.The monopoly of railway transportation suft'ers from

several major weaknesses, emanating mostly from ri-eidities in

pricin-e, mana-qement and labour, leadin-s to poor and declinin-qquality of services on the one hand and heavy operational andfinancial net losses on the other. The operational losseshindered the development of railway tracks, did not permit

strengthenin-q and maintainin-s the rollin-e stock and otheroperational systems, and forced SLR to heavily depend on

continued bud-qetary support of lar-te magnitudes.

Althou-eh the SLR has 1,445 track kilometres, it operatesonly on 1,200 track kilometres as services beyond Vavuniya on

the Nothern Line and beyond Madawachchiya on TalaimannarLine have been suspended due to extensive damages. About a

half of the available track is below the minimum standards and

is subject to a very low maximum speed limit and high accident

risks.The available rollin-e stock is only around 85 per cent of

the required level. By end 2004, SLR had only l3l locomotivesand power sets althou.eh it required 153 to provide a

satisfactory service. Most of the locomotives and power sets are

over 25 years old, while 75 per cent of the coaches in the stock

is over l5 years old. The operations monitorin-e system coversonly a part of the network, and has not been updated.

The operated train kilometres improved marginally from

8.3 million in 2003 to 8.4 million kilometres in 2004. I{owever,

passenger kilometres (which takes into account the number of

passen,qers as well as the distance) improved sli-thtly from theprevious year due to lower fares compared to fares of

alternative modes of transpurtation services.

The total revenue of SLR increased by 27 per cent in 2004,

mainly due to the 50 per cent increase in rail fares in 2004. The

operating expenditure also increased by 28 per cent, largely dueto the increase in the cost of fuei and salaries and wages.

Consequently, the operatin-e loss of SLR increased by 28 per

cent to Rs. 2,650 million in2004, exertin,e a heavy butden on

the bud-set.To overcome the deflciencies of SLR, it was converted to

an Authority in 2003, in terms of the Sri Lanka RailwayAuthority Act No. 60 of 1993, aiming at providing the

necessaly flexibility and budgetary independence to run it as

a commelcial enterprise. However, due to labour a-eitaticln, the

January 2005 and any restructurin-e pro-qramme has now to beimplemented within the or-qanisational structure of a

as a prelude to any restructuring pro_eramme,Civil Aviation : Benefitin-u from the ceasefire, bothinternal and international air travel increased during the lastthree years. Vital reforms were made in the civil aviationsector, leading to a greater degree of deregulation, and adoptingbilateral liberalization agreements to attract more internationalcarriers and tourists to the country.

Three domestic airlines continued to operate durin_{ 2004.The first civil helicopter service recommenced commercialoperations in July 2004 after a lapse of eight and a half years.SriLankan Airlines introduced three water aerodromes or Air-taxis aimin-{ at increasing domestic air transportation. For theconvenience of the travellers to the Jaffna peninsula, a terminalfacility at the Palaly Airport was built at a cost of Rs. 4 million.However, the number of passengers travellin_g domestically byair, dropped due to the improvement in road transportation toJaffna. The construction of a domestic terminal at theBandaranaike International Airport (BIA) was scheduled to beconmenced by March 2005.

Durin_u 2004,37 International airlines, including 8 cargoairlines, operated in Sri Lanka, compared to 30 airlines thatoperated in the previous year. The number of passen_eers whopassed through the BIA, and frei,sht tonnage handled increasedby25 percent and l8 percent, respectively,in2004. However,the share of the national carrier, SriLankan Airlines, inpassengers and freight transportation declined in2004 with theexpansion of activities of other airlines.The Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka (CAASL)established in 2002, which replaced the Department of CivilAviation, continued to provide more flexibility to regulate civilair operations within Sri Lanka, while being responsible forformulatin-e aviation policies, preparing aviation developmentplans and strategies, enforcing aviation safety requirements andcoordinating with international civil aviation organizations.The Ministry of Ports and Civil Aviation has initiated thefbrmulation of an aviation policy for Sri Lanka, covering theoverall developments and the mana_eement of the aviationsector. To further enhance the liberalization, the Air NavigationAct No. l3 of 1950, will be replaced by the proposed CivilAviation Act, which would provide greater flexibility in civilaviation.Sri Lanka faces several deficiencies in attracting majorairiines, with attendant disadvanta-qes. Of them, insufficientinfrastructure and inadequate ancillaly services such as highcost bunkerin-{ services, poor road transportation and

Car-eo handling efficiency at Jaye Container Terminal(JCT) of Sri Lanka Porrs Aurhority (SLPA) improved during2004, buildin_e on the performance that led to winning theNationalAward forProductivity in 2003,an award presented bythe Ministry of Labour and Foreign Employment. The mainfactors that contributed to the better performance were theextension of working hours, rationalisation of the incentivepayments, training of personnel and the implementation of asuccessful voluntary retirement scheme. The Unity ContainerTerminal (UCT), built under the North Pier DevelopmentProject, was opened for cargo handling in June 2004. As aresult, the container handling capacity of the Port of Colomboincreased by 250,000 TEUs per year.

is earmarked for expansion by constructin-e two berths with

deeper draft in the outer harbour funded by JBIC. The

Trincomalee port will be developed as a 'port city' focusing on

the development of tourism, as well as providin-q services to

regional industries.

The number of container ships that anived at the port of

Colombo dropped by I per cent during2004, although the

volume increased, reflecting the anival of large container ships.

The number of conventional ships anivin-9 at Sri Lanka ports

in2004 also decreased by 4 per cent. The drop in conventional

vessels was mainly due to the diversion of cargo transportation

from conventional form to containerized form as the latter is

more economical, faster and safer. The number of ships callin-e

for bunkering services has been declinin-g in recent years, and

in2004 it declined to a mere 14 ships from a peak of 285 ships

that anived in 1993. The main reason is the higher prices of

bunker fuel at Colombo, which are higher by about US dollars

80 - 100 per MT than prices in Sin-eapore. This explains why

the feeder vessels originatin-e from Bangladesh and India travel

to Singapore for such services bypassing Colombo.

The port services continued to face new challen-ees from

regional competition, specifically, the new ports developed inthe Middle East and South India. The technological

advancements that contribute to the efficiency of port services

are takin-e place at a rapid pace and any port that is obliviousto those developments is bound to be pushed back by the

competitors. Hence, any plan to develop the port services

should take cognisance of the future requirements rather than

concentrating on the current issues.

Water Supply and lrrigation

Sustainable water supply and irrigation are national priorities.Achieving sustainable use of water resources requires

improved water management practices, appropriate pricin-e to

prevent wastage and over exploitation.The sufficient availability of water to meet all the

requirements of people is a major issue in many countries

includin,e Sri Lanka. Reco,enising this deficiency, one of theMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) set by the United

Nations requires that all citizens in a country to have access to

safe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities by 2015.

In achieving this target, Sri Lanka aims at providin-q access to

safe drinking water for at least 85 per cent of the population by

2010.Two major factors threatening the long term sustainabilityof water resources in Sri Lanka are improper pricing and

deficiencies in regulation. Pipe borne drinking water is subject

to a price, with a subsidy segment, but other forms of water

supply are not subject to any pricing leadin-e to possible over

exploitation and inefficient utilisation. In this connection, only

a few re-eulations exist on the usage of natural aquif-ers and

other torms of rvater resources, threatening their long term

sustainability.The proportion of households with access to an improved

water sources was about 7l per cent in 2004, of which, only

about 28 per cent had access to pipe borne water. However, the

supply is subject to frequent intenuption. The supply of rvater,

therefore needs to be expanded significantly to meet both

current and future demand. The water supply and sanitation

sector has shown continuous expansion, but at a slower pace,

in the recent years. The government continues to play a major

role by investing in the development of water supply schemes

and the distribution of water.The National Water Supply and Drainage Board(NWSDB) has estimated that the investment requirementsfor the water supply sector to reach MDGs by 2010 wouldbe Rs. 85 billion. However, the annual allocation by the

govemment for this purpose has been only around Rs,7 billion.This indicates that alternative funding sources need to be

tapped in order to realise the MDGs on water supply and

Weaknesses in p procedures also unnecessarily

delay timely maintenance. Reservoir site management also

faces problems relating to retention of professionals andskilled workers mainly due to inadequate remuneration,difficult working conditions, the lack of training, basicinfrastructure such as health, education, transport andcommunication facilities in the area and other logistic

facilities.This emphasises the need for establishing alternative

sources of funding for proper maintenance of Mahaweli

dams/reservoi rs. The Mahawel i Inigation and HydropowerSurvey report submitted by the UNDP in 1969 hasidentified the importance ofraising adequate funds for the sno traditibn in Ceylon of pay

amount of water used, in order to prevent water wastage

and prontote crop diverstfication' (page 99). However,

there is no such system yet established. On the other hand,

there is no charge on water suppted to the CEB for power

generation either. The Mahaweli power plants generated

Early actions need to be taken to ensure proper

maintenance of reservoirs. All pending urgent maintenancework needs to be completed as early as possible; giving

high priority. A competent independent committee should

examine problems relating to the sustainable maintenance

of all dams/reservoir projects in the country and formulate

a set of minimum standards to be maintained to minimise

the risk of dam failures.Alternative funding sources should also be explored.

Introducing a reservoir maintenance contribution (RMC)

payable by electricity consumers based on the water

released from Mahaweli reservoirs for power generation

can be considered as a source of tinancing maintenance.This will require only about Rs- 0.05 increase in the

electricity tariff per unit, which will generate about Rs, 300million per year, Introducing a user charge on irrigation

water also should be considered to part finance the cost of

maintenance of irrigation infrastructure and also to reduce

wastage of water. Other forms of revenue generating

activities such as licensing fishing rights in Mahaweli

reservoirs subject to security regulations and promoting

tourism and recreational activities also could be considered.It is also needed to introduce legislation on dam safety

standards and regulations and enforcing a periodic'Engineering all large-scale bY

per month. Of the total water consumption, about 70 per

cent is in the domestic sector, but it contributes only onethird of the total revenue. A rational tariff system, which

reflects the economic cost of water, would reduce wastageof water.During 2004, NWSDB implemented severalwater projects utilizing both local and foreign funds. It

invested Rs.12,747 million in water supply schemes in 2004,

utilising almost all the capital funds allocated for the water

sector. NWSDB handled 73 local funded projects and 14foreign funded projects during the year. The SecondalyTowns Water Supply and Sanitation Project, the Water

Treatment Plant Project at the Right Bank of the Kelani river

and the Third Water Supply and Sanitation Project were

some of the major foreign funded water supply projects

implemented in 2004.

The total revenue of NWSDB increased slightly to Rs'

4,910 million in 2004. The increased revenue was largely

driven by the expansion of the consumer network. Indicating

the need for an urgent revision in water tariff rates, NWSDB

reported a net operating loss of Rs. 383 million in 2004, in

contrast to a net operating profit of Rs.279 million in 2003'

However, when the depreciation of assets is accounted tor, the

net financial results of NWSDB record a significant loss,

eroding its capital base and requiring the taxpayers at large to

provide funding for its replenishment.

The Department of lrrigation carried out several locally

and foreign funded projects during 2004. The HambantotaIrrigation and Rehabilitation Project and the Weli Oya

Irrigation Project were two major foreign funded projects

implemented by the department. In addition, the department

implemented 26 locally tunded projects. The total expenditure

Part IChapter 3 - ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

on locally funded projects and foreign funded projects in2004

amounted to Rs. 225 million and Rs.357 million, respectively.

Successive -qovernments since independence have invested

lar-ee amounts of funds in the construction of reservoirs, major

irri.Qation and in land development. However, these assets have

not been properly maintained. The lack of proper maintenancewill not only result in an increase in the cost of maintenancesubstantially in the future, but also would lead to underutilisation and risks of structural failures.The lrri-eation Department continued to implement the

participatory ini,eation management project covering major andmedium scale irrigation schemes through the 'Wap Haula'

pro-qramme. I'he Department also renovated a large number ofminor irrigation tanks in 2004, under the government's 1,000minor inigation tanks renovation project.

3.3 Social Infrastructure Policies,Institutional Set up and Performance

As the World Bank recently indicated, in many dimensions, Sri

Lanka has already achieved the MDGs, notably in universalnetprimary enrolment, gender equality, as well as in minimisingthe infant and maternal mortality. Sri Lanka's key socialindicators stand well above those in comparable developin-ecountries and on par with many developed countries, However,the social infrastructure has not yet evolved into aninternationally competitive service framework, capable offuellin-e hi-eh economic growth and satisfying the -erowingdemands of the population, especially in the areas of hi,ehquality education and health; it further faces the challenge ofmaintainin,g the existing achievements, since all indicatorspoint to a gradual deterioration in both the quality and outreach.

Health

The health sector suffered from several major setbacks in2004.As in the previous years, there were frequent labour disputes inthe public sector health services, crippling the services andputtin,q the general public into inconvenience. A majoroutbreak of Den-eue Fever (DF) and Den.eue Hemon-hagic Fever(DHF) infected more than 13,000 persons and claimed 73lives.These illustrate the continuin.e difficulties in maintaining theheavy public funding of the government health carepro-qrammes provided to all without targetin-e. The deteriorationin some aspects of public sector health services was to someextent, an'ested by increased private sector investments mainlyin curative health care, However, preventive care, mostly of apublic good nature, suffered due to inadequate funding andother typical state sector inefficiencies, undermining SriLanka' s historical achievements, Therefore, proper tar-eetingcould save funds fbr pleventive health care thus elevatin_q SriLanka's health performance. This is specially relevant since theprivate sectclr investors have a very minimal incentive inpromoti n_e preventi ve health care.Under the health sector reforms, key recommendations

made by the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on Health in 1997continued to be implemented on five fionts: improvin_e at least

one hospital in each district, expanding the services to areas of

special needs, developin-e health promotional programmes,reforming the organizational structure includin,{ alternative

financin-e mechanisms and promoting resource sharing with theprivate sector. Along these lines, the Ministry of Health

developed a National Health Development Master Plan with

the cooperation of JICA, in October 2003.

Under the programme of developing at least one hospital

in each district, 34 hospitals in outstations have been identifiedfor a phased development. To decentralise and develop mental

health services, action has been taken to establish at least onemental rehabilitation centre in each district. In addition, 50hospitals under the estate sector management have beenidentified for further development by the government. Of these,

22 hospitals have already been taken over by the government

and are bein-e improved.As a tradable service, Sri Lanka's health services aregradually gaining competitiveness through increasedinvestment by the private sector. The recent surge in privatehospitals indicates the need for meeting demand for highquality health care when the public sector fails to provide

the same. This is specially relevant to Sn Lanka's effbrts atattracting tourists by providing the necessary infrastructurein niche areas such as health tourism. With the increasingparticipation of the private sector in the provison of healthcare, it is essential to develop a market based regulatoryframework to ensure that quality and standards aremaintained.It is apparent that the entry of the private sector into theprovision of health care services has helped the country toprevent a general breakdorvn of the whole system. This waspartly facilitated by releasing the vast amount of knowledgewithin the public sector health services for use by the private

sector. Accordingly, the services of the specialists attached tothe public sector health care system were formally made

available to the private sector. Similarly, though not officiallysanctioned, the services of technicians too were tapped byprivate sector institutions. This move can be described as aprivatisation of inputs of a health care system and it has

benefited all the stakeholders involved. It is norv necessary to

move a step further by permitting private medical schools under

a strict standard setting f ramework of the -qovernment. Suchprivate medical schools will help students following the biolo.ey

stream to realise their goal of pursuing a medical educationwhich the public sector is unable to satisfy at present due to

resources constraints, liberalise the input market further andprovide effective competition to public sector medical schoolsto upgrade quality, attain excellence and be the benchmark

setter in medical education. The mostly expressed fear that thequality of the services would be compromised is totally

unfounded, since all other inputs of the health care services such

as buildings, equipment, vehicles and drugs are produced andsupplied by the private sector.

Education

A continuously improving education system is a pre-requisitefor rapid growth and development. The education systemincludes general education, technical and vocational education

and finally higher education. In the past decade, private sectorinvolvement in general education has shown an exponentialexpansion, filling gaps in Sri Lanka's public sector driven

educational system.The education reforms introduced in 1998 primarilytargeted improving the quality of public education,

strengthening service delivery and improving the economic andsocial relevance of the educational institutions at all levels. At

the same time, reforms of university education and vocationaltraining provided by the state focused on the expansion and

creation of opportunities in tertiary education.The present policies in respect of general educationemphasise on the need for reducing regional disparities. Inthis respect, severai steps have been taken to improve theinfrastructure facilities in rural and semi urban areas. Thesesteps include those taken under the 'Navodya SchoolsProgramme' and increasing the number of teachers in those

areas.

Several steps were taken to improve the quality and therelevance of school education which were mar-einalimprovements within the system; introduction of activity basedlearning approaches, addition of Information TechnologyEducation to the curriculum, establishment of studentcounselling and career guidance programmes and thepromotion of English education. However, theSe measures fall

short of the sector-wide educational reforms that are needed for

transformin-e the country's educational system to meet furtherrequirements in Iine with the changin-{ global practices.The shorta-qe of qualified and competent teachers to runthe public school system has been a chronic issue, which hasnow become acute. In developed countries, -eraduates are

required to follow post-{raduate teacher training courses inorder to obtain a licence to practice as teachers. Such trainin,e

courses equip the prospective graduates who choose teachingas a career by choice, with innovative teaching methods,educational psychology and motive for self-learning for theirown career advancement. It is therefore, imperative that thepositions in schools be frlled by those who choose teaching as

a career and not by those who choose teaching in the absenceof any alternative employment opportunities. Further, thosewho are recruited should be given a comprehensive training inteaching methods and educational psychology, to enable themto become competent teachers.The general education sector was hit with a serious blowby the tsunami in December, completely dama-qin-q 68 schoolsin eleven districts, partly damagin-e 105 schools and a largenumber of schools housing refugees. The total estimated cost

to rebuild these schools has been estimated at Rs.l,l3l million.University education in Sri Lanka, which is a public sectormonopoly, suffers from both the failure to meet the demand andfailure to supply a quality education in many fields compatiblewith global trends. This failure is demonstrated by manyindicators: a large number of students enterin-{ the labour forceat an early age, choosing vocational training instead ofuniversity education, travelling abroad for education andforeign education institutes making a commercial presence inSri Lanka to attract local students. The rigid agitation within SnLanka by pressure -qroups has kept the government postponin-e

the much-needed decision of deregulatin-e the higher educationsector, which is akin to regulating domestic production infavour of imports. However, it should be noted that at the timeof independence, Sri Lanka attracted students from manyforeign countries due to the high quality university educationprevalent at that time.The private sector's entry to university education is

opposed on the ground that it is a retrograde step to deny thehigher education opportunity to low income students in ruralareas. Hence, it is argued that the public sector's supply ofuniversity education should be continued to support suchstudents. However, it appears that those supportin-q this

argument have failed to understand the ground reality, that is,

the inadequate supply of public university education has hit thevery same class of students by keeping them away fromuniversities, whereas the well-to-do have been able to educatetheir children at forei-en universities. If private universities arepermitted, a part of the demand for places in the publicuniversity system will shift to private universities, therebyenabling students from low-income groups to secure moreopportunities in public universities. Further, the competition

between the private and public universities willpromote quality

and innovation, leading to excellence in university education,benefitin-e all the stakeholders.However, the dere-qulation of the university education hasto be accompanied by a comprehensive scheme of

accreditation, continuous monitoling and periodic evaluationto maintain the required standards in line with the chaneins

Education of Sri Lanka (NITESL) conducted several trainingprogrammes for teachers. It also engaged in curriculumdevelopment, teaching aid and material development inaddition to setting up of skill development projects with

assistance from the ADB.The shorta-ue of instructors and technical staff and

inadequate funds to provide equipment to training centres has

become a serious issue in technical education and vocational

trainin-e.lmproving quality and relevance of vocational training

through enhancing the competence of teachers and cunicuiumdevelopment and upgrading the existing infrastructure intraining institutions are the major challenges in the sector.

Housing and Urban Development

The demand for houses and urban infrastructure increases with

the continuing population -erowth and economic development.The annual demand for new houses in Sri Lanka is estimated

to be rising at a rate of 80,000 to 100,000 units, in addition to

the need for meeting a large pent up demand. At the same time,

there are a large number of sub-standard houses requiring

upgradin-e.The government's involvement in housing is significant,

although its role is now changing from the direct provider to a

facilitator. With the increasing income levels, the private sector

has now emerged as a strong force catering especially to middle

and high-income households.

The National Housing Development Authority (NHDA),Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (MFAR) and

Plantation fluman Development Trust (PHDT) play a key role

in the provision of public sector housing. The NHDA continuedto implement the Model Village Housin-e Programme, theEstate Housing Programme and the Direct Construstion

Pro,eramme. Under the Sevana Piyasa pro-qramme, the NHDA

provides permanent roofin-e materials to poor households. The

poorest segment is entitled to receive an additional financial

grant of Rs,10,000 to meet the cost of the roof structure. A totalof 2,133 households benetited under this programme in 2004.However, housing programmes implemented by the NHDA

indicated a slow pro-qress in 2004, mainly due to its financialconstraints.ln2004, the MFAR completed 714 housin,e units

for fishermen. The PHDT continued with implementing several

Furthermore, distanceeducation through the use of advanced communication andinfbrmation technology is gaining its ground across the globe.Hence, alternative means of higher education need to beexplored in the wake of a serious deficiency in higher educationopportunities in the country.International studies show that the social rate of return ofprimary and secondary education is si.enificantly higher thanthe private rate of return, justifying the continuation of public

investment in primary and secondary education. However, theprivate rate of return is higher in tertiary education, thusindicatin-u that private individuals are willing to share theinvestment in tertiary education.There are several other private and public institutions,which provide similar education in Information Technologyand other professional education areas.

The -eovernment policy on housing is -qeared to creatin,{ aconducive environment to mobilise housing finances and creditfacilities with a view to promoting individual housingconstruction, to clear the backlog and meet the future demand.It has been proposed to provide the initial capitalto implementan estate sector housing programme over a 3-year period tocomplete 50,000 housing units. The government has also set atarget of 300,000 housin-e units to be developed for low andmiddle-income people. Action has also been taken to providegovernment servants with housing loans up to Rs.l million at aconcessionary interest rate of 4 per cent per annum throughcommercial banks. It has also been proposed to allocateidentified plots of land among property developers with BOIincentives for the development of residential houses ataffcrdable price s. A ne w housing loan scheme has also been

proposed in Budget 2005 for retumin-{ mi-Qiant workers.

The volume of housing loans trom tire financial sector hasincreased in 2004. Commercial bani.s have recorded an

increase of housing loans by about Rs l5 billion in 2004. The

State Mortgage and Investment Bank, HDFC Bank and theNational Savin-es Bank together granted l8,l4l housing loansin 2004, in comparison to 28,289 loans in 2003.

The construction of houses damaged by the tsunami willpose a gigantic challenge in 2005. About 65,000 houses areestimated to have been completely destroyed and 44,000

houses partly damaged by the tsunami in December2004.The urban population in Sri Lanka living in MunicipalCouncil and Urban Council areas was 14.6 per cent as

estimated in 2001. Since then, several Pladesiya Sabbas havebeen identified to be upgraded as urban areas, which wouldsubstantially increase the urban population.Urban Development Authority (UDA) plays a key role inplannin-e and executin_q urban development projects in thecountry. It also provides consultancy services to all localauthorities in respect of urban planning and development. Themain operationalactivities of the UDA include the constructionof administrative complexes, commercial complexes, townimprovement projects, industrial projects, integrated projects

and social and cultural projects. Expeditin,e the preparation ofiity development plans through Integrated UrbanizationPlanning Approach was a major task entrusted to the UDA in2004. Though the development plans had been finalized forGalle, Matara and Hambantota, after the tsunami, the UDA hadto launch a programme to prepare new plans includingrehabilitation and reconstruction programmes in tsunamiaffected areas.

Environment

Sustainable development is given high priority in anydevelopment plan. Ne-sative externalities arising fromeconomic activities could have an adverse impact on the naturalenvironment. Economic instruments for environmentalregulation, effective enforcement and creating awareness

among the general public play an important role in protecting

the environment. The Ministry of Environment and NaturalResources (MENR), the apex body of maintaining a balance

between rapid economic development and sustainability ofnatural resources, has taken several steps to protect theenvironment.With a view to protect watersheds in central hills, theMENR proposed the National Wetland Policy and the NationalWatershed Mana-eement Policy and obtained the Cabinetapproval in 2004. The MENR also fbrmulated the NationalCleaner Production Policy and Strategies with a view toproviding guidelines for sustainable production and

consumption. It highli-thts the efficient use of row materials,

use of ecologically sound practices and the efficient use ofwater and energy resources by minimising wastage in theproduction process, The MENR initiated the drafting of a

National Policy and Strategy on Traditional Knowled-se for SriLanka with financial assistance provided by the UNDP. To

protect the marine environment from land base activities, the

IvIENR formulated a 'National Action Plan' fol the protectionof the marine environment in collaboration rvith the Coast

Conservation Department, the Ministry of Fisheries and Ocean

Resources, Central Envitonmental Authority and the Ministry

of Housin,e and Infrastructure Development. The Air ResourcesMana-[ement Center (Air MAC) implemented several

programmes to improve public awareness on air pollution and

finalised the Cleaner Air Action Plan -2007 during the year.The MENR established the Environmental Treaties

Reference Centre (ETRC) in 2004 to monitor, co-ordinate and

implement international environmental treaties. These treatiesinclude'Combat Desertification and Drought Convention','Basle Convention for the Control of TransboundaryMovements of Hazardous Wastes and Disposal' and the'Stockholm Convention for the control of Persistence Oreanic

obli-tations to the public by -riving directions. Local authoritiescould be encouraged to reprocess waste by linking it to theannual -qrant they ,{et from the central government, for

example local authorities, which reprocess according to theset standards could be -eiven an increased ,erant from the
