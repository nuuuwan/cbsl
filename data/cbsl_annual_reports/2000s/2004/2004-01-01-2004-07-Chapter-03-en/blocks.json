The mainfactors that contributed to the better performance were theextension of working hours, rationalisation of the incentivepayments, training of personnel and the implementation of asuccessful voluntary retirement scheme. The Unity ContainerTerminal (UCT), built under the North Pier DevelopmentProject, was opened for cargo handling in June 2004. As aresult, the container handling capacity of the Port of Colomboincreased by 250,000 TEUs per year.
