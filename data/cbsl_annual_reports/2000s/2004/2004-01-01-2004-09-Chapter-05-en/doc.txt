EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

5.1 Overview

In 2004. Sri Lanka's external sector benefited from theincreased global economic growth and the expansion ininternational trade. However, the country had to face a fewchailenges that were posed by way of unexpected external

shocks. External trade expanded considerably with an increasein both exports and imports. Export earnings in US dollar terms

increased by 12 per cent, reflecting the volume growth of 8 per

cent and unit price increase of 4 percent, to US dollars 5,757million, outperforming the 9 per cent growth recorded in 2003.This rate of growth was the highest annual growth since 2000,benefiting from the higher global demand and improved exportcompetitiveness. In the meantime, imports grew by 20 per cent,

led by increases in both volume (9 per cent) and prices (10 per

cent), to US dollars 8,000 million, compared with the 9 per centgrowth in 2003. The resultant terms of trade recorded adeterioration of 5.2 per cent in2004 mainly due to the sharp

increase in import prices of intermediate and investment _eoods.The drou_sht in 2004 necessitated higher imports of crude oiland food items, while the international oil prices reachedhistorically hi_sh levels and sharply increased the petroleumimport bill, Consequently, the trade deficit widened to USdollars 2,243 million, which was partly financed withremittances and net earnings in the services account, therebycontaining the cunent account deficit to US dollars 648 million.The higher global economic growth and the peacefulenvironment that prevailed in Sri Lanka in view of theceasefire, helped the earnin_rs from tourism to continue itsgrowth momentum, which in turn, contributed to a surplus in

the services account. Worker remittances grew at a healthy rateof ll per cent in 2004, retaining its position as the iargest netinflow to the country. However, the surpluses in the servicesand transf'er accounts were not sufficient to fully offset thewidened deficits in the trade and income accounts, worseningthe current account balance. This situation was further

aggravated by the lower net inf-lows to the capital and financial

account mainly due to the decline in forei_qn aid disbursements

to the govemment. A notable development in financial inflowsduring 2004 was the significant increase in capital flows to theprivate sector by way of forei_qn direct investments, loan capital

and portfolio investments, reflecting improvements in foreigninvestors' confidence. Holever, net inflols in the capital andfinancial accounts rvere not sufficient to offset the currentaccount deficit, and hence the overall balance of payments(BOP) recorded a deficit, reversing the trend of surpluses

recorded in the previous three consecutive years. This led to adecline in external ofticial reserves and increased the pressureon the exchange rate. In this adverse environment, thecontinuation with the independently floating exchange rate

regime, pursued by Sri Lanka since 2001, helped to mitigate theimpact of the external shocks, and helped the country to

from this development throu,qh greater access to bothagriculturc and non-a,ericulture markets in developed countries.In2004, the WTO concluded the second Trade Policy Reviewof Sri Lanka. In the review, while bein_s critical of some of the

developments since 1995, WTO members were mostly positiveabout Sri Lanka's policy directions.At the Eleventh Session of the United Nations Conferenceon Trade and Development (UNCTAD XI) held in 2004, SriLanka palticipated in discussions on debt relief and debtsustainability, specific needs of small vulnerable and net foodimporting economies, market access through the movement ofnatural persons, issues relatin_{ to Sri Lanka on Trade RelatedIntellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), benefits under the GlobalSystem of Trade Preferences (GSTP) and technical assistanceon capacity building.Sri Lanka is actively pursuin_e the receipt of greaterbeneflts under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP)

fi'om participating developed countries, through a change in theRules of Ori_ein (ROO) criteria on a cumulative basisconsidering entire South Asian Association for Re-eionalCooperation (SAARC)countries . In view of the recent tsunamidisaster, EU is considerin-q granting Sri Lanka special

concessions under the GSP. In addition to this, Sri Lanka hadalready received special incentives fiom the EU in vierv of SriLanka's sound labour practices.

On the re_eional front, SAARC leaders agreed to establish

the South Asian Preferential Trade Agreement (SAFTA) witheftect from I January 2006. Under the SAFTA, seriousattempts will be made to reducing tariffs and remove NonTariff and Para Tariff Barriers to promote intra-regional traoe,and investment. Members of the Bay of Ben_eal Initiative forMulti-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMST-EC) formerly known as Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, SriLanka and Thailand Economic Cooperation, signed aframework agreement to set up a Free Trade Agreement (FTA)

in February 2004. The f,rrst BIMST-EC Summit attended by the

Heads of State was held in July 2004, in Thailand. The summitfocused on a wide range of issues such as transnational crimeand terrorism, combatin_e and controllin-e disease, povertyalleviation, promotion of tourism, ener-qy, fisheries andindigenous medicine and knowledge.There were several accomplishments in bilateral traderelations in2004. Sri Lanka and India agreed to convert theIndo-Sli Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISLFTA) into aComprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA)

incorporatin-e trade in services and investment. The Pakistan-Sri Lanka Free Trade A-ereement (PSLFTA) was si-ened in

February 2005. Underthe PSLFTA, SriLanka willleceive dutyfree access for 206 items. In addition, Sri Lanka will receiveduty fi'ee access for tea to Pakistan, on a quota basis. Pakistanwas an important market fbr Sri Lankan tea in the 1970s andgradually lost its share to Kenya. The a-{reement will pave theway for regainin-q some of the lost market share.

maintain its external competitiveness. Meanwhile, thecountry's total external debt as a percentage of GDP declinedmarginally, reflecting the lower net loan capital inflows durin_e

the year. On a positive note, the debt service ratios remained

at low and mana.aeable levels.

5.2 External Sector Policies andInstitutional Support

[n2004, international trade continued to operate in a free andliberal environment, as per undertakings _eiven by Sri Lankawhen it accepted the IMF Article VIII status in 1994. Bein,q asmall open economy, the continuously improvin_9 liberaleconomic environment and the _ereater freedom, which thecountry has promoted in trade, investment and payments havebenefited Sri Lanka immensely in maintaining its growthmomentum in the midst of external shocks and adverseenvironments during the last three decades. However, to

safe-euard the country from large and volatile capital flows,limited capital account restrictions are still in place.

The maintenance of an independently floatin_e exchan-9erate regime since 2001 has se rved the economy well,particularly the export sector, which grew continuously exceptin a few selected years when it faced disturbances. It has helped

the country to maintain its external competitiveness, through

autonomous variations in currency movements broadly in linewith Sri Lanka's economic fundamentals vis-a-vis the rest ofthe world.

The external trading environment was stren,ethened byentering into several multilateral and bilateral arrangements

and ne,eotiations in 2004. Sri Lanka negotiated in the WorldTrade Organization (WTO) fora, to bring a settlement to theunequal tariff being imposed on Sri Lanka as against tariffimposed on other competitors by major countries such as thethe USA, EU countries, Australia and Japan. The lacklustreperformance at WTO negotiations in the aftermath of the

collapse of the Cancun Ministerial Meetin_e was reversed rvith

the adoption by the WTO General Councila framework to take

ne-eotiations under the Doha Development A-qenda fbrlard, inthe areas of Agriculture, Non A_ericultural Market Access(NAMA) and Development Issues. Sri Lanka stands to benefit

At the seventh session of the Joint Commission for

Economic Cooperation between Sri Lanka and Iran held in

January 2004, two countries agreed to establish a Pret'erential

Trading Agreement. Discussions were held on the elimination

of the textile quota at the l6'r'session of European Commission

(EC) - Sri Lanka Joint Commission held in October 2004, At

the third round of negotiations under the Bangkok Agreement,Sri Lanka received preferential treatment with respect to

several export items. A few rounds of discussions were held in

2004 to establish a Comprehensive Economic Partnership

Agreement between Sri Lanka and Singapore (CEPASS) in

2004.In addition to paving the way for increased market access

throu-eh multilateral and bilateral negotiations, the government

has been providing a wide spectrum of support to exporters. In

2004, special incentive schemes were made available for

exporters re-eistered with the Board of Investment (BOI) of SriLanka, subject to minimum investment requirements. Theseincentive schemes include tax holidays, concessionary taxes

and import duty exemptions on capital -{oods and raw material.The Sri Lanka Exports Development Board (SLEDB),

continued to bnng together the govemment and entrepreneurs in

resolvin_e problems on trade and investment at the Exporters'

Forum, in addition to providin-q support on marketing, financin,r

and online access to international data bases. The SLEDBformulated the National Export Strategy (NES) covering theperiod 2004-2008, with inputs from both the private and state

sectors. The Sri Lanka Export Credit Insurance Corporation(SLECIC) continued to assist exporters throu-eh export credit

insurance and guarantees. The Sri Lanka Standards Institution(SLSI) supplied the guarantee of quality for export items a-gainst

the relevant Sri Lanka standalds. The trade and taritf cluster andthe export cluster of the National Council for Economic

Development (NCED) continued to review the trade related

issues and made relevant recommendations in2004 to promote

external trade. Several more incentives were proposed by the

Bud-eet 2005, which focussed on increasing value addition by

exporters. Those include VAT reduction fbr local suppliers of

intermediate goods, duty free concessions to acquire advanced

tech nol ogy, fi n anc i al assi stance for te chno I o-qy i mprove men [,

simplified VAT applications and a zero rate VAT structure for

garment buying offices.A f'ew export items were subject to a cess, which -eeneratesfunds for research and development of respective industries. In

addition to the continuing cess on tea and coconut exports, a

cess on cinnamon exports was introduced and the cess on rubber

exports was reintroduced in 2004. The import tariff structure

underwent severalchanses in2004 with the multiple objectivesof enhancing Sri Lanka's competitiveness, raising fiscal

revenue, simptifying the tariff structute, and lowering the costof living. However, it has proven difficult to meet all the

objectives at the same time, For example, on January 1,2004,

tariff bands were changed from 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 per cent

respectively to 3, 6, 12,16,20 and 27 .5 per cent to raise revenue,

but it would have raised the cost of production too. At the same

time, duty waivers have been granted on imports of wheat grain,

crude oil, refined petroleum products, printed books, gem and

-eold. textile, paddy and vegetable seeds and pharmaceuticals.

These waivers were followed by a further set of full and partial

duty wait ers granted on February 1.2004 on dhal and reducedduty on potatoes, big onions, chillies and milk powder, to

contain domestic price escalations. In the remainder of the year,

duty waivers were granted on sugar and rice to provide further

retief to the public, but duty was re-imposed on big onions and

brown sugar (see Box 4).

The the maximum a,ee of used motor vehicles eligible to

be imported was extended by six more months to three and a

half years flom the be-einning of 2004, to reduce the import costof motor vehicles. Meanwhile to discourage excessive

importation of hi_eh value and fuel inefficient motor vehicles,excise duty was increased on October 15,2004 to economiseon fuel consumption in the wake of rising oil prices. This

measure was further strengthened by subjectin_e these importsto a 100 per cent deposit margin requirement. Finally, onNovember 19,2004, the six tariff band structure was reducedin Bud-eet 2005 to a four band structure comprising 2.5, 6, l5

and 28 per cent, with effect from the beginning of 2005. Toguide Sri Lanka's tariff formulation, the Presidential TariffCommission was reformulated as a cluster in the NCED in2004. The ultimate outcome of various tariff waivers and tariffreductions was the decline in the average tariff on imports,reflecting the prevalence of a more liberal trade re_9ime in 2004.The avera_ee tariff declined from 5.3 to 4.5 per cent in2004.

However, it should be noted that maintaining a low andpredictable tariff structure would promote investor confidenceand increase resource allocation efficiency, enabling Sri Lankato reach a high long term economic growth path.

5.3 Trade in Goods and Trade Balance

External trade expanded further in2004, with increases in bothexports and imports. Export earnin_{s grew by 12 per cent to USdof lars 5,757 million compared to the 9 per cent -{rowthrecorded in 2003, reaching the highest performance since 2000.Imports grew by 20 per cent to US dollars 8,000 million,recordin-{ a sharp increase over the 9 per cent growth in 2003.This has led to a widening of the trade balance by US dollars704 million to US dollars 2.243 million.

Paft IChapter 5 - EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

In 2004, the unit value index of exports rose by 4,0 per

cent benefiting mainly trom increasin-e demand tbr tea, rubber

and -eems in the international markets. However, a sharp

increase in the import price index reflecting price increases in

petroleum, building materials, fertilizer, wheat, sugar and milk

products resulted in a deterioration in the terms of trade by 5.2

per cent. Furthermore, the narrow export base and excessive

dependence on a f'ew markets remain sources of significant

risks in export performance in Sn Lanka,

Export Performance

Industrial exports preponderate in export earnings with a hi-eh

share of 78 per cent, while agricultural exports account only lbrl9 per cent. Hence, the contribution to the -erowth in exportsin 2004 was mostly from the industrial sector, which

contributed 85 per cent. The comparative fi-eure for agricultural

exports was l6 per cent.A,sricultural exports grew by l0 per cent in 2004

reflecting the hi-sher performance of the three major crops, viz.

tea, rubber and coconut. Tea was benefited by higher prices,

while coconut registered a relatively higher volume -erorvth in

2004. Rubber exports benefited both in terms of volume and

prices. Tea prices increased by 7 per cent to US dollar 2.46 per

k-c in 2004 mainly due to an increased demand for low grown

tea from the Middle East, Russia and other fbrmer Soviet Block

countries. Russia continued to be the largest buyer of Sri

Lankan tea with a share of l9 per cent of the total tea exportsin 2004 fbtlowed by United Arab Emirates and Turkey. The

moderate growth in tea production led to a moderate increasein the volume of tea exports by I per cent. This led Kenya to

overtake Sri Lanka as the lar-eest exporter of tea, supported by

a large production increase in that country. The share of value

added tea exports, packeted tea and ,qreen tea expotts decre asedwith a lower demand. Export earnings from coconut increasedby 22 per cent in 2004 with higher exports of desiccatedcoconut and coir fibre products, which benefited from the

increased demand fiom the Middle East, Germany and China.A special lax was imposed from January 2005 on imported

edible oil to support the coconut industry. The export of rubbergrew by 33 per cent in 2004, havin-e benefited from the

continuous increases in prices since July 2002. The demand forlocal consumption by the manufacturing sector reduced thevolume of rubber available for exports thereby affectin-q

earnin-es from exports of rubber as a primary product. To meetthe local demand for rubber as an industrial input, 14,256metric tons of natural rubber were imported in 2004.

Minor a-uricultural exports increased by 8 per cent in 2004in sharp contrast to the l0 per cent decline in 2003. The grorvth

was mainly supported by higher exports of cloves, vegetables,

cinnamon and unmanufactured tobacco. This sector benefited

from duty free access to the Indian market under the ISLFTAand the strong demand from the Middle East countries for

vegetables. Export earnings from dried and fresh fruits, betel

leaves and essential oils increased, while earnings from coffee,pepper,nutmeg and mace and cardomom declined in 2004.

The growth of the industrial exports by l3 per cent was ledpredominantly by the strong pedormance attained by textilesand garments, machinery and equipment and rubber based

products. This was supported by increased market access thatwas afforded to these sectors throu_eh trade negotiations.Textiles and garment expofis, which accounted for 49 per centof the total exports and 62 per cent of industrial exports grew

by 9 per cent in 2004, in spite of the strict competition which

Sri Lanka began to face in the wake of the phasing out of theMFA. The volume of apparel exports in 2004 grew by 8 per

cent, while export prices increased by I per cent. The apparelindustry was able to minimise the potential risks arising fromthe heavy concentration in the US market by expanding its

market share in the EU. Garment exports to the EU market

benefited from the special incentive arrangement with the EU

under the GSP scheme since February 2004. Other industrialsub sectors, except leather, travel goods and footwear,continued to grow in 2004. The jewellery sector, which

suffered a setback in2002 recovered steadily responding to the

high demand from major trading centres such as Belgium,Israel, Vietnam, USA and Japan. Jewellery producers werebenefited by the exemption of VAT on the import of raw

materials such as gold, silver, diamonds, pearls and gems.

Earnings from mineral exports increased by 43 per centin 2004 in contrast to a decline in 2003 mainly due to thehigher exports of gems, which accounted for 90 per cent ofthe mineral exports. Gem exports that had been adversely

affected by unresolved issues in the gemstone trade in 2003,regained the market, posting a robust growth of 38 per centin 2004. Sri Lanka continued to be the largest supplier ofhigh quality sapphires to the world market. USA continued tobe the largest buyer of Sri Lankan gems in 2004 followed byJapan and Thailand. It is noteworthy that there is scope forincreasing earnings from jewellery exports, if the countrycould go for innovative designs, supported by modern skills

and sufficient raw materials in the form of cut and polishedgem stones.

Imports grew by 20 per cent to US dollars 8,000 million in2004, as against the 9 per cent growth in 2003, reflecting theimpact of the economic expansion, the prolonged drought, the

escalation of oil prices and the relatively low interest rateregime. The economic expansion resulted in an increase in theimports of investment and intermediate goods, while the

drou.eht conditions led to an escalation of the imports of fooditems and petroleum products.

Over the years, since the economic liberalisation in l97l ,there has been a gradual change in the composition of imports,with consumer goods declining and intermediate andinvestment goods increasing. In 2004, the share of consumergoods further declined to 20 per cent, rvhile the share of

intermediate and investment imports increased to 58 and 2L percent, respectively.

The expenditure on consumer goods increased by l0 per

cent to US dollars 1,623 million in 2004. Rice imports were

increased to keep the market supplied with this staple food itemin the wake of low domestic production and in response to theremoval of the duty of Rs. 9 per kg on rice imports sinceSeptember,2004.Imports of all major categories of consumer

durables increased except the imporls of motor vehicles, which

recorded a marginal decline. The imports of motor vehiclesincreased by 12 per cent in the first three quarters of 2004

compared with the correspondin-e period in 2003. However, as

a result of the increase in excise taxes and the introduction of aminimum cash margin of 100 per cent to cover the Letters ofCredit witheffect from October22,2004,the imports of motor

vehicles for private use declined sharply in the last quarter of2004.Intermediate -{oods imports, consistin,e mostly of textiles

and petroleum, grew by 22 per cent. The average price of crudeoil increased from US dollars 29.46 per barrel in 2003 to US

dolf ars 37 .48 per barrel in2004leading to the higher growth in

the value of imports, The import volume of crude oil is limited

by the refinery capacity. Hence, to meet the increased demandfor petroleum products, more refined products were imported.The sharp increase in the export of textiles and garments

required higher imports of raw materials. Other intermediategoods imports such as paper, chemicals, jewellery, bakery andrubber based manufacturing rndustries, increased by l5 per

cent.

Investment goods imports, notably, building materials,

transport equipment and machinery and equipment increasedby 27 per in 2004, having benefited from the economic

expansion and the low interest rate regime. The largest item in

investment goods, machinery and equipment, which accountsfor more than a half of the import category and consists ofpower generators, transmission apparatus, data processingmachines, telecommunication equipments and sewin,q

machines etc. increased by 23 per cent in 2004. The growing

Direction of Trade

The direction of trade remained mostly unchan,qed in 2004.Industrialised countries dominated by the USA and the EU

continued to be the major destinations for Sri Lanka's expofts.

The USA has been the sin-ule largest buyer of Sri Lanka's

exports since 1979 and continued to be an important market forSli Lanka's textiles and garments with a share of 58 per cent.

However, the share of exports to the USA has declined from 35per cent in 2003 to32 percent in 2004 mainly due to the

expansion of trade with other countries. The reduction of theexport share of the USA is also attributed to the somervhat

hi-eher duties, preferential treatment given to many otherdeveloping countries and increased competition fiom othertextile e xporting countries. The duty range applicable to SriLankan products in the USA stood between 0 per cent and28

per cent. Thus, SriLanka continued to negotiate with the USAto convert the Trade and Investment Framework Asreement(TIFA) into a Free Trade Agreement.UK is the second largest destination for Sri Lanka'sexports with a share of 14 per cent of total exports. The largestexport item to the UK, textile and garments, accounted for 23per cent of the total textiles and -qarment exports. The UK was

a major market for tea and rubber based products too.Trade with India sharply increased in 2004, benefitingfrom the concessions offered under ISLFTA. Since the signingof the ISLFTA in 2000, the share of exports to India has been

increasin_t. In 2004, it amounted to 7 per cent, an increase from

5 pel cent recorded in 2003. Some of the major expofts to Indiawere refined copper, electric conductors, waste and sclap ofalloy steel, cloves, desiccated coconut and cored wire.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 200497

Part IChapter 5 - EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICIES

Other major destinations for Sri Lanka's exports were

Germany, Bel-eium- Luxembourg, Japan, Italy, Russia and theUAE. The main exports to Germany were garments, tea, solidtyres, gloves and coconut fibre producis. Diamonds andgarments were the main exports to Bel_eium-Luxembourg.

Other major items exported to Western countries were precious

stones, gloves, tyres, coconut by-products, prawns and fishproducts and figurines and ornamental articles. Meanwhile,exports to Japan decreased as a result of the low exports offrozen shrimp. The output of the shrimp farming industry

continued to decline due to bacterial diseases and inefficient

management.Asian countries, as a group, continued to be the majororigin of imports. Their market share increased from 53 per

cent in 2002 to 56 per cent in 2003 and 57 per cent in 2004 as

imports from these countries increased by 2l per cent in 20M.Countries in the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC) accounted for 9 per cent of the total

exports and 20 per cent of the total imports in 2004. The EU

accounted for 15 per cent of the total impolts in 2004.India was the largest source of imports (18 per cent),followed by China including Hong Kong (14 per cent),

Singapore (9 per cent) and Iran (5 per cent). Imports from India

increased by 34 per cent in2004, with main imports beingpharmaceutical products, wheat, rice, transport vehicles, and

cotton yam. The trade deficit with India has also increased from

US dollars 828 million in 2003 to US dollars 1,048 million in2004. Sri Lanka's trade with Pakistan also increasedsignificantly over the previous year, though still insignificantin value, that is I per cent each in both total exports and total

rmports.

The main items in trade in services have traditionally beentransportation, travel and other business services. In

recent years, however, the other business services category wasfurther disaggregated into information technology,telecommunication, construction and insurance services as they

account increased by about 5 per cent to US dollars 419 millionin2004.

Trade in Transportation Services

Inflows from transportation services, consisting of passengerfares, freight charges and port related earnings, increased byabout I I per cent in 2004, on account of the increased

passenger fares, resulting from the record number of touristarrivals and increased port related activities, led bytranshipment cargo. Outflows of transportation services

increased by about l5 per cent reflecting the surge in imports,

improve productivity in other sectors of the economy. Otherpossible reasons for the decline could be the increased use ofthe Intemet, facsimile and e-mail for communication.Meanwhile, net earnings from IT exports increased by I Iper cent to US dollars 72 million in 2004. However, theseincipient foreign exchange earnings foretell the enormouspotential, which Sri Lanka has in this area for futureexploitation. In this connection, the continuation of skillsdevelopment, further expansion in telecommunicationinfrastructure to ensure reliable connectivity and speedytransmission are crucial factors for future development of IT

exports.

Inflows and Outflows of Income

The rise in global interest rates coupled with a prudent

management of official reserves by the Central Bank caused

the interest income and trading profits from investing officialreserves to increase by 16 per cent, although the level ofofficial reserves recorded a significant decline in 2004. Thegains from exchan-ee valuation adjustments declinedmarginally in2004, due to the lower depreciation of the USdollar against other major currencies, compared with the

sharper depreciation experienced in 2003. The gross income

earned from total external reserves increased considerably as

the rise in income from official reserves was supplemented by

a rise in income from reserves held by commercial banks. Theoutflow of income increased by 6 per cent in 2004 due to theincrease in profits and dividends repatriated to foreign

investors and share holders as well as higher interest payments

made on external debt. Consequently, the income accountdeficit widened by 19 per cent to US dollars 204 million in2004 as the absolute size of the outflows were considerablyhigher than the inflows.

Current Transfers

Net inflows to the transfers account continued to be the majorsource of financing the widening trade deficit. Workerremittances increased by I I per cent to US dollars 1,564million in2004, partly due to an increase in the number of SriLankans working abroad. The number of annual migrahts foremployment increased by 2percent to 213,114 in 2004.Worker remittances from the Middle East region

accounted for 55 per cent of total private transfers. Despite arise in the number of workers, the relative share of earningsfrom the Middle East region has been declining gradually from

2000, due to a rise in employment in Europe that paid relativelybetter remunerations. The West Asian countries continue torecruit more unskilled workers, especially housemaids. During

2004, about l8 per cent of the total transfer receipts came fromcountries in the European Union, which recorded a continuousgrowth in the last 5 years. The other significant contributorswere other European countries, North America, and the Far

East that accounted for about 8 per cent, 7 per cent and 5 percent of the total remittances, respectively,

Travel and Tourism

Sri Lanka's tourism industry recorded the hi,ehest ever arrivalsof about 566,200 tourists in2004. Gross earnings from tourism

increased from US dollars 340 million in 2003 to US dollars413 million in 2004. The total earnings, including earningsfrom visiting non-resident Sri Lankans, increased by about l0per cent to US dollars 513 million. The gross expenditure ontravel also increased by about 6 per cent to US dollars 296million in 2004 as a result of more Sri Lankans choosins totravel abroad.

Western Europe, which accounted for 50 per cent of thetotal arrivals in 2004, continued to be the largest tourist-generating region for Sri Lanka, recording an increase of 13 per

cent in 2004. Arrivals from Asia, led by lndia, increased by 12per cent, accounting for 35 pâ‚¬r cent of the total arrivals in 2004.Anivals from Australia, North America, The Middle East and

Eastern Europe too recorded significant increases in 2004.One third of the embarkation levy and the one per centlevy on the turnover of tourist establishments are beingchannelled to the Sri Lanka Tourist Board (SLTB) forpromotional activities and human resources development.Collections from the embarkation levy and the one per centlevy on the tumover of tourist establishments in 2004 amountedto Rs.439 million and Rs.301 million respectively. The SLTBalong with the Ministry of Tourism unveiled a specialpromotional campaign known as 'Bounce Back Sri Lanka' torebuild the county's image as a popular tourist destination.

Trade in Telecommunication and InformationTechnology Services

Net eamings from telecommunications services, which havebeen on a declining trend since the liberalisation of theinternational gateway in April 2003, declined further by 27 percent to US dollars 33 million in2004 due to an increasing

number of international calls generating from Sri Lanka. As aresult of the increased competition, the cost of international

calls generating from Sri Lanka became lower than the cost ofcalls generated from abroad. This is an usual trend at thebeginning of the liberalization process but not a concern, sincethe availability of better communication facilities would

Worker remittances have become the single largest intlolvof forei-qn exchange after exports and play an important role in

of fsetting the impact of the trade det'icit on the current account,lt has been reported that a significant amount of worker

remittances are still coming into the country through informal

channels. The availability of money transfer facilities in bankbranches in rural areas and the rationalisation of applicable

char,ees would facilitate the remittance of money throughformalchannels. Towards this end, the NationalSavin_es Bank(NSB) was permitted to open accounts and mobilize

remittances from Sri Lankans working abroad. In addition, the

government proposed, in the Bud-eet 2005, to introduce severalincentives such as housing loan facilities for workers who areremittin-{ money throu,qh state banks.

The official cunent transfers such as food and commodityaid, cash grants, and technical assistance .qrants decreased byt7 per cent to US dollars 30 million in 2004 in line with lowforeign aid inflows.

5.5 Capital and Financial Accounts, andBalance of Payments

Capital and Financial Accounts

The combined surplus in the capital unci financial accountsfinances the current account deficit. The excess or deficit ofcapital and financial accounts, after financing the currentaccount deficit is reflected as a BOP surplus or a deficit,respectively. The capital account, which records grants incapital nature, mostly to the government from donors,

decreased by l4 per cent to US dollars 64 million. The financial

account recorded a surplus of US dollars 572 million in2004

compared to the surplus of US dollars 648 million recorded in2003. The decline in the surplus of the capital and financialaccount was mainly due to lower official inflows by way ofloans and grants, This decline was partly offset by higherprivate capital inflows by way of foreign direct investment(FDI), loans and portfolio inflows.

Foreign Direct Investment

FDI inflows to Sri Lanka including privatisation proceeds

increased by 2 per cent to US dollars 233 million in 2004,

recordin-e the highest annual florvs received by the countrysince 1997. This was due to the implementation of a largenumber of BOI a_qreements that were contracted earlier.However, the approvals and commitments of FDI declined

durin-e 2004, partly due to political uncertainty in the aftermathof elections and partly due to the more careful screenin,e of FDIapplications to ensure the quality and the reliability ofinvestments. This lower amount of approved FDI is not likelyto reduce the actual FDI inflows in the future, as the selectedprojects are more likely to be implemented. The services sectorrecorded the hi_ehest percentage of FDI inflows (47.7 percent),indicating a continuing trend of a shift towards service-basedindustries from manufacturin_e, in line with the emer,eing globalpatterns. The outflow of FDI remained low at US dollars 6million during the year, because they were permitted only ona case-by-case basis.

Privatisation Proceeds

Foreign inflows of privatisation proceeds decreased from USdollars 30 million in 2003 to US dollars l0 million in 2004, thisbeing the balance due from Lanka IOC. Though there wereexpectations of high privatisation proceeds from foreign

sources in 2004, much of the expected funds were not realised

due to the delays in the divestiture of a part of the CPC assets,and several other public sector enterprises.

Loan Capital to the Government

The total long-term inflows to the,qovernment decreased by l6

per cent to US dollars 771 million in 2004, while the outflowsdeclined by US dollars 28 million to US dollars 331 million.The significant decline of program loans to US dollars 30million in 2004 fiom US dollars 226 million in 2003 waslargely due to delays in the implementation of structuralreforms. The disbursement of project loans increased by 4 per

cent to US dollars 591 million in 2004 from US dollars 569million in 2003 primarily due to the faster implementation ofprojects towards the latter part of the year.Of the total loan receipts, 93 per cent were received on

concessional terms and the balance 7 per cent on commercialterms and conditions. The multilateral lending agenciesprovided the bulk of the foreign loans in 2004. ADB andIntemational Development Association (IDA) continued to be

the major multilateral lending agencies providing around USdollars 185 million and US dollars 68 million, respectively.Bilateral assistance amounted to US dollars 347 million, ofwhich US dollars 271 million was received from Japan and US

dollars 25 million from Germany. The financial assistance from

Japan accounted for about 38 per cent of total concessional

loans, while ADB and IDA accounted for 26 per cent and l0

per cent, respectively,The shortfall in external financing on concessional terms

and conditions were partly offset by new issues and rolloversof foreign currency denominated loans on commercial terms

and conditions. These loans would provide only a temporaryrelief to the shortfall that would not be a substitute for medium2003 2004

and long term external financing on highly concessional terms

and conditions. From the external sectoL's point of view, thesedollar denominated loans would not brin,s additional capital

flows into the country, as mostly resident commercialbanks areinvesting in the SLDBs in the form of FCBU loans to thegovernment, It would only be a compositional shift of

commercialbanks' foreign reserves to ofticial foreign reserves.From the point of viel of public debt, these loans wouldincrease debt service burden due to hi-eher cost and low

maturity. Therefore, attempts at a hi-qher utilisation of available

foreign assistance on concessional terms and conditions shouldform the top-most strategy of external financing.The fbreign aid utilisation rate declined in 2004 by 6

percentage points from24 per cent in 2003 to l8 per cent in2004. The uncertain political environment that prevailedduring the early part of 2004 and the delays in projectimplementation due to institutional weaknesses, inflexible

procedures and administrative diffrculties have contributed tothis low utilisation of foreign aid. Though the committee

appointed by the government to accelerate the utilisation offunds implemented several measures to overcome such

problems, the overall aid utilisation ratios indicate that there arestill -eaps to be filled to reach optimal levels. Donor assistanceto government comes with an anay of concessions. Hence, itis very important that such funds are effectively and timelyutilised, as the cost of funds fiom this source is very muchlower than the alternative commercial sources.

The slight improvement in foreign aid utilisation ratios in

2003 was partly due to the temporary institutional set-up, which

focused on faster implementation of foreign funded projects.Establishing a permanent institutional set up with proper

authority to streamline the implementation process wouldimprove the utilisation of available donor assistance onconcessional terms and conditions. The government has

already created such an institutional framework in the form ofthe Taskforce for Rebuilding the Nation (TAFREN), for

acceleratin-e the use of donor assistance pled-eed for post

tsunami reconstruction.

Loan Capital to the Private Sector

Long-term capital inflows to the private sector and publiccorporations increased sharply to US dollars 169 million in2004 from US dollars 101 million in 2003. The maincontribution to this increase came from the successful US

dollars 100 million-bond issue by the Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT),

which was oversubscribed by several folds by foreign investors.

This is the first-ever international bond issue by a Sri Lankan

company in the international markets and would encourage

other Sri Lankan companies [o secure capital in such markets in

the future. Through this bond issue, the company managed to

mobilise funds at a relatively low rate without any government

guarantee. For this purpose, the SLT had to obtain international

rating independently as sovereign ratings are not available for

the country. Hence, the availability of sovereign ratings wouldfacilitate the private sector to mobilise medium and long-termfunds in the international markets on better terms and

conditions. Apart from the funds raised by the SLT, only a f'ewprivate sector companies engaged in new foreign borrowings

durin-e 2004, as the domestic lending rates were attractive.

In the past, foreign loans to the private sector were largely

ananged throu.eh government intervention by way of providing

guarantees or on-lending by the govemment usin-[ donor funds.This was partly due to the state ownership of a large numberof public corporations. With the privatisation of thesecorporations and rising public debt, the government hasgradually moved away from intervening to mobilise medium

and lon,{-term credit to the private sector. However, the countrystill needs to attract medium and long-term loan capital fromforeign sources at competitive rates to promote private sector

investment, as domestic resources are not sufficient to maintain

investment at the desirable level for achieving higher rates ofeconomic grorvth. The government could play the role offacilitator to help private sector to raise external bonowings by

obtainin-q sovereign ratings for Sri Lanka. In this connection,

the recent decision under the NCED framework for obtaining

sovereign ratin.es for Sri Lanka is a move in the right direction.

Short-term Capital

during the year. Meanwhile, private short-term credit,comprising short-term export and import related suppliers'credit, recorded a higher net inflow of US dollars 28 millionwith the expansion in external trade,compared to the net inflowof US dollars 19 million recorded in 2003,Despite commercial banks converting some of theirforeign assets to foreign currency denominated domestic assets(SLDBs and FCBU loans), net foreign assets of commercialbanks increased by US dollars 152 million in2004 comparedto an increase of US dollars 95 million recorded in the previousyear. Foreign assets of commercialbanks increased mainly dueto a sharp rise in private remittances to NRFC accounts, receiptof the balance of privatisation proceeds from the sale of CPC

assets to Lanka IOC, international bond issue by the SLT andforeign borrowings by commercial banks and few other privatesector enterprises. External liabilities of commercial banksincreased mainly due to a substantial increase in foreigncurrency deposits. A relatively higher depreciation of the rupeeduring the second and third quarters and expectations of afurther depreciation during the fourth quarter of 2004 alsoencouraged commercials banks to accumulate and hold ontomore assets in foreign currencies than in the previous year.

Balance of Payments and External Reserves

Since the net inflows to the capital and financialaccount werenot sufficient to finance the widened current account deficit. theoverall balance of payments recorded a deficit of US dollars205 million in2004 compared to the surplus of US dollars 502million recorded in 2003. This deficit exerred pressure on both,the exchange rate and official reserves, during 2004.

External Reserves

Gross official reserves of the country, which had beenincreasing since 2001, reflecting surpluses recorded in the BOPin the last three consecutive years, declined in 2004. Increases

in the intemational commodity prices, including the historicallyhigh oil prices, and the increased volume of imports of bothintermediate and investments goods, substantially increased theimport expenditure during the year, exerting pressure on theexternal reserves and the exchange rates. This, coupled with thedelays in disbursement of donor assistance to government, ledto an excessive volatility in the exchange rate market during thesecond and third quarters requiring the Central Bank'sintervention in the forex market to contain the excessivevolatility, which in turn ledto a loss of reserves. However, thedeterioration in official reserves was contained to some extentby the new issues and rollovers of foreign cuffency loans, thereceipt of financial assistance from ADB and Japan, and aforeign currency loan repayment to government by the SLTduring the fourth quarter. Reflecting these developments, thegross official reserves declined to US dollars 2,l96million byend December 2004, from US dollars 2,329 million in 2003.The decline in official reserves increased the country'svulnerability to external shocks measured in terms of basicindicators.

declined to 3.3 months of imports by end 2004 from 4.2 monthsof imports at end 2003. Similarly, the level of official reserves

at end 2004 was sufficient to meet only 79 per cent of all short

term extemal liabilities of the country compared to 102 per cent

at end 2003. This ratio would decline further to 74 per cent at

end 2004 if foreign currency denominated domestic liabilitiesmaturing within a year were also included in the short-term

external liabilities. The latter is a more appropriate measure of

the adequacy of gross official reserves from a vulnerabilitypoint of view, as domestic forei_en currency debt of thegovemment are serviced out of official reserves.Despite the decline in official reserves, the total external

reserves of the country increased by US dollars 220 million toUS dollars 3,438 million at the end of 2004 from US dollars3,218 million in 2003, mainly due to the build up of external

assets of commercial banks.

5.6 External Debt and Debt Service

External Debt

Sri Lanka's total external debt as a percentage of GDPdecreased to 57.8 per cent in 2004 from 58.4 per cent in 2003.However, in absolute terms, the total external debt increased by7 per cent to US dollars 11,346 million as at the end of 2004.As a wider aggregate, the total extemal debt and banking sectorexternal liabilities increased by about 9 per cent to US dollars

12,775 million. The increase was reflected in increases in bothconcessional government debt and bankin,e sector externalliabilities. More than 40 per cent of the increase in external debtin US dollars is due to the depreciation of the US dollar againstmajor cunencies, as approximately 42 per cent and 3l per centof debt are denominated in SDR and Yen, respectively.Medium and long-term debt, accounted for about 94 percent of the total debt stock in 2004, of which 84 per centconsisted of concessional debt of the government. with theremaining l6 per cent representing the non-concessional debt.The non-concessional debt consisted of mostly medium andlong-term private sector debt, as the Government non-concessional debt stock is relatively small. In US dollar terms,

the government non-concessional debt stock increased by 7 percent to US dollars 232 million by end 2004. Higher andefficient utilisation of loans on concessional terms and limitins

Chart 5.9

External Debt

non-concessional debt are crucial factors for Sri Lanka tomaintain a sustainable level of extemal debt.Total private sector short-term debt increased by about 4per cent to US dollars 647 million during 2004 from US dollars

620 million. The stock of govemment guaranteed external debtof public corporations and private sector declined by l6 per

cent to US dollars 507 million, as the government was cautiousin providing such guarantees in line with its policy of reducingcontingent liabilities. The decline was entirely due to theamortisation of debt owed by Sri Lanka Airlines and SriLankaTelecom during the year amounting to US dollars 73 million.Private sector external debt without government guarantees

increased significantly by about 23 per cent to US dollars 4l Imillion in2004 due to a successt'ul international bond issue bythe SLT amounting to US dollars 100 million.Short-term external debt stock of the country, whichconsists of trade credit, increased by about 4 per cent to USdollars 647 million. The share of short-term debt in the totaldebt stock decreased marginally to 5.7 per cent. Liabilities tothe IMF decreased by US dollars 110 million during the year

due to the repayment of outstanding loans under the Stand ByArrangement (SBA) programme, Meanwhile, externalliabilities of the banking sector increased by US dollars 383million to US dollars 1,429 million by end 2004 mainly due toa temporary stock of ACU liabilities and an increase incommercial bank liabilities.Reflecting the above-mentioned developments, the totalexternal debt and other liabilities including bankin_q sectorliabilities increased marginally to 65 per cent of GDP in 2004from 64.1 per cent of GDP in 2003. However, as alreadycommented upon, in US dollar terms, the debt stock increasedby 9 per cent to US dollars 12,775 million.

Foreign Debt Service Payments

Total debt service payments consisting of both amortisation ofmedium and long-term foreign debt and interest payments onall foreign debt increased by l0 per cent to US dollars 839million in 2004. The total amortisation payments, whichaccount for about 70 per cent of debt service payments,increased by 12 per cent to US dollars 590 million in 2004mainly due to an increase in repayments to the IMF on accountof the outstanding facilities under Stand-by Arrangements(SBA). During the year, capital repayments to the IMF

increased to US dollars 107 million from US dollars 32 rnillionin 2003. However, amortisation payments of government debt

decreased by 8 per cent to US dollars 331 million mainly dueto declining defence loan repayments. The interest payments

increased by about 6 per cent to US dollars 249 million in2004,reflecting increases in both the government's external debtstock and global interest rates. Furthermore, due to theweakening of the US dollar in the international markets,repayments on debt denominated in Japanese yen and SDR

increased by l9 per cent and l6 per cent, respectively.The country's capacity to service the external debt, as

measured by the debt service ratio, deteriorated marginally in

2004 compared to an improvement in 2003. despite animprovement in forei,en exchange earnings, mainly due to asubstantial increase in repayments to the IMF during the year.When repayments to the IMF are excluded, the ratio remainedalmost at the same level as in 2003. However, these ratios arenot considered excessively burdensome by international

standards, as concessionary debt accounts for the major share0f total -qovernment debt.

earlier in the year. During the last two months of 2003, it

suffered from high volatility due to both -elobal and domestic

shocks. A salient t-eature in 2004 was a further continuation of

this depreciatin-e trend throu-ehout the year. With the pressure

exerted by the BOP deflcit on the exchange rate, it reached

Rs.10-5.47 per US dollar, on l7 December 2004,the hi-ehest ratein the interbank market. However, in the aftermath of thetsunami disaster, the market reacted with an anticipation of

lar-ee fbrei-sn aid inflows to the country, and the exchange rate

responded by appreciatin-e to Rs.l04.6l per US dollar by 3l

December 2004. Fol the year as whole, the rupee depreciatedby 7.5 per cent a-qainst the US dollar compared to a marginal

depreciation of 0.01 per cent in 2003.

depreciated mar_einally by 1.0 per cent and l. I per cent, with

respect to the 5 cunency and 24 currency baskets, indicatingonly a marginal improvement in the competitiveness of SriLanka's exports. Hence, by and large, the exchange rate of SriLanka has remained stable in real terms in 2004.

Developments in the Domestic ForeignExchange Market

The developments in the external sector during the year had amixed impact on the domestic forei-qn exchange marketactivities during 2004. The unceftainty that prevailed during the

year had a dampening impact on the forward market activities,while increasing transactions in the inter-bank spot market. Theinter-bank forei gn exchan ge vol ume including the.forward

market volume increased substantially to US dollars 4,330million in 2004 from US dollars 3,649 million in 2003, due tothe large volume of trade in the spot market. The forwardvolume in the foreign exchange rharket, however, decreased to

US dollars 1,026 million (23 percent of total transactions) fromUS dollars 1,442 million (38 per cent of total transactions)recorded in 2003,

The forward market, which was active at the beginning of2004 with a total of US dollars 355 million in transactionsdunng the first quarter of the year, gradually declined duringthe year to record US dollars 233 million and US dollars 201million in the second and third quarters before rising again to

US dollars 232 million in the final quarter. Movements of both

the volume and the premium of forward transactions reflectedthe levels of uncertainty that prevailed during the year. The

average annualised forward premium increased to 7.86 per centand 8.33 per cent for the I month and 3 month categories offorward transactions by the end of the year, in excess of theinterest rate diff'erentials that prevailed at 4.8 per cent for thetwo categories, The forward premia have been higher than theinterest rate differentials throughout most of the year,indicating market expectations of faster depreciation of theculrency or higher interest rates.As in 2003, the Central Bank continued to intervene in theforei-{n exchange market to mitigate the excessive volatility inthe foreign exchange market. In contrast to heavy purchasesin 2003 to build up the official reserves, sale of foreign

exchange dominated in2004 as the Central Bank intervened to

meet the increasing demand for foreign exchan-{e in the market.Accordingly, the Central Bank sold US dollars 541.7 million

and purchased US dollars 27 million in2004, resulting in a net

sale of US dollars 514.7 million.
