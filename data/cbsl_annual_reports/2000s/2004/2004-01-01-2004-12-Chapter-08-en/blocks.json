In addition, banks wererequested to display lending rates and deposit rates at theirplaces of business. Another major contributory factor to thehigh interest rate spread has been hi_sh NPLs in the bankingsystem. The resolution of NPLs is often impeded by lengthyand cumbersome legal procedures, which also involve highcosts in addition to unsavoury political interference.Accordingly, the implimentation of the necessary le_qalretbrms and a more effective institutional framework, perhapswith the setting up of an asset management company as donein several countries, would be useful. Other possible measuresinclude offering competitive lending rates based on theprospects of projects and by properly assessing the quality ofcollateral, and promoting and developin-e the corporate bondmarket, given that the bond market could exert pressure onbanks to reduce their lendin-e rates through increasedcompetition in financial intermediation.Restructuring of the Trvo State Banks: TheGovernment, in Budget 2005, has committed itself to therestructuring of the two state banks to put them on a soundfinancial footing and make them commercially viableinstitutions in recognition of their predominant position in thetinancial system of Sri Lanka by virtue of their sizeable market",
