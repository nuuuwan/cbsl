FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND STABILITY

8.1 Overview

Benefiting from the continued economic growth, financialsector activities expanded further, and the financial systemremained resilient in2004 amidst several internal and externalshocks.r The anay of financial services offered by financialinstitutions expanded, deepening financial sector activity in theeconomy. Trading volumes in financial markets increased in2004 with some market indices reaching record levels. Severalinitiatives were taken in2004 to strengthen the availability offinancial facilities to micro-enterprises and small and mediumenterprises (SMEs) and enhance access to finance. Financialinfrastructure was improved and modernised with furtherreforms in the payment system by establishing a ScriplessSecurities Settlernent (SSS) system and a Central Depositary

system (CDS) fbr government securities and linking it up with

the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system introduced in

2003. During 2004, the re,eulatory and supervisory frameworkwas further strengthened to improve the soundness of the

bankin-e system, while movin_{ further in line with international

best practices. A number of legislative and regulatory reformswere implemented in 2004 to stren_ethen the le_eal andregulatory framework and promote efficiency and stability inthe t-inancial sector.[n2004, an expansion in financial services was evidencedby increases in deposit mobilization, loans and advancesgranted, service outlets of the financial institutions, lease andhite purchase facilities, and insurance activities that which havebeen expanding under a healthy competitive marketenvironment. Many financial institutions also expanded thearray of financial services offered to their customers,introducing new value added services. Reflectin_e thesedevelopments, the total assets of the financial syste m innominal terms expanded by l5 per cent in 2004. Similarly, thefinancial assets to GDP ratio increased from 134 per cent in2003 to 135 per cent in 2004. Value addition of the flnancialservices increased by 6.6 per cent in 2004. However, this waslower than the 10.6 per cent growth registered in 2003, due tothe base eff'ect of the higher growth in profits in 2003, thenarrowin-e of the interest spread, which however is still hi,eh,and the reduction in capital gains from investments in bondsand securities.

Financial markets recorded a furlher expansion as seen inthe tradin_q volumes of many market segments. Activity in the

short-term inter-bank call money market and the primarymarket for government securities increased further, butsecondary market transactions in government securitiesdeclined in view of the uncertainties with regard to interestrates. The volume of transactions in the foreign exchangemarket increased, benefiting from expanded external tradeactivity in 2004. Equity market performance improved with theAll Share Price Index, the number of transactions and marketcapitalisation reaching record levels in 2004. The nascentcorporate bond market continued to suffer from high issuecosts, insufflcient awareness of market participants and theavailability of alternative easily accessible bank financing,specially bank credit at attractive rates, particularly to blue chip

compantes.To enhance efficiency, competitiveness, and resilience of

the financial sector as well as to promote the soundness of thefinancial sector, several measures were taken to upgrade and

strengthen the payments system and the regulatory system in2004. Further developments of the payments and settlementsystems was undertaken by linking up the RTGS systemimplemented in 2003 with the SSS system and the CDS forgovemment securities to facilitate the settlement of government

securities in scripless form. Meanwhile, the Re-eistered Stock& Securities Ordinance (RSSO) and the Local Treasury BillsOrdinance (LTBO) were amended to facilitate theimplementation of the SSS system.The regulatory fiamework rvas furthcr strengthened bytakin-e measures such as applyin-e the capital adequacyrequirement on a consolidated basis covering the subsidiaries,streamlining provisioning requirements pertainin_q to nonperformin-e loans (NPLs), issuing guidelines restrainingextefnal auditors from undertakin_e non-audit services in bankssimultaneously with the external audit and requirin_q banks toobtain credit ratings and publish the same by mid 2005. An

amendment to the Banking Act was apploved by the Parliamentto stren-ethen the regulatory framework. A new Payment

Systems bill Act has also been dlatied to stren-ethen the legalframework -Eovernin,e the payment, clearing and settlementsystems in Sri Lanka.

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka

The total assets of the Central Bank increased by l7 per centin 2004, This increase was a net result of a sharp increase in theholdings of Treasury bills, an increase in provisional advances

and a decline in forei-en assets. Net Forei-en Assets (NFA) of

the Central Bank declined by Rs. l3 billion, mainly because theCentral Bank had to provide US dollar liquidity in the domesticforeign exchange market in the context of excessive pressurein the market due to hi,eher oil prices, until some short tomedium BOP support was anan_eed by the government, Thedecline in international reserves was partly offset by the saleof the proceeds of the Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs)by the government to the Central Bank. The purchases of

Treasury bills by the Central Bank to maintain market liquidityresulted in an increase in the Treasury bill holdin-ss by Rs. 63billion. Provisional advances to the government, which areprovided by way of a revolving credit facility, increased by Rs.4 billion in 2004.

On the liability side, the total cunency issue of the CentralBank increased by l7 per cent (Rs.l7 billion) reflecting the

increased demand for currency for transactions purposes, whilestatutory deposits of commercial banks with the Central Bank

af so increased by 29 per cent (Rs. l2 billion) reflecting thegrowth in deposit liabilities of LCBs.

Licensed Commercial Banks

Durin-e the year, the number of LCBs operatin_e in thecountry remained unchan_{ed at 27, while the branch networkand other service outlets expanded from I,817 at end 2003to 1,890 by end 2004. The banking density, defined as thenumber of bank branches per hundred thousand persons inthe population, improved from 6.9 in 2003 to 7.1 in 2004.The total number of automated teller machines (ATMs)

operated by LCBs increased to 810 from 710 at end 2003,while the number of electronic fund transfer facilities at thepoint of sale (EFTPOS) increased to 6,542 from 4,794 duringthe same period.The expansion in commercial banking operations wasreflected in significant increases in deposits, loans andadvances as well as an expansion in bankin_e services.Commercial banks also took several initiatives to better

manage their risks through improving risk identification, riskmeasurement and risk miti_qation. Reflecting thesedevelopments, financial soundness indicators improved in2004. Namely, an increase in capital funds, a decline in NPLratios and an improvement in provisioning were seen in2004. Meanwhile, several LCBs had published creditratings by end 2004, which would become mandatoryin 2005.

2004. Within credit to the private sector, loans, which

constitute 69 per cent of the total private sector credit, increasedby a higher rate of 27 per cent in view of the relatively lowinterest rates, as compared to overdrafts, which increased by l3per cent. The outstanding amount of credit in respect of creditcards grew by 37 per cent and stood at Rs.l l.l billion at end

2004, alon-e with an increase in credit cards.

The overall exposure of commercial banks to the public

sector declined in 2004 with the reduction of the holdin-es of

Treasury bills and Treasury bonds by commercialbanks, which

suryassed the net increase of commercial bank investments inSLDBs and the increase in credit to public corporations.However, net credit to the government (NCG) from the banking

sector increased tn2004, due to increased holdings of Treasurybills by the Central Bank. Commercial bank holdings ofTreasury bills and Treasury bonds declined by Rs.33 billion,mainly due to a decline in Treasury bond holdings as banksdisposed of their holdings in view of the expectations of an

Structure of Assets and Liabilities of LCBs: Thestructure of assets/liabilities of LCBs changed with a fasterincrease in foreign assets and liabilities in comparison todomestic assets. Foreign assets of domestic banking units(DBUs) and fbreign currency banking units (FCBUs) increasedby 35 per cent, while domestic assets rose only by 8 per cent.Similarly, foreign liabilities of DBUs and FCBUs rose by l9

per cent whereas the -erowth in domestic liabilities was l3 percent. Accordingly, the share of forei-en assets in total assetsincreased from29 per cent in 2003 to 36 per cent in 2004.

The total assets of LCBs increased by 17 per cent in2004,

due to the increase in both forei-{n assets and domestic assets.The increase in foreign assets was mainly due to the increasein private remittances, an increase in fbrei_en currency holdings

as a result of the increase in forei-qn cuffency deposits and an

increase in bonowin,qs by some banks to meet the liquid assetrequirement, which now has to be maintained in terms offorei-9n currency, an increase in discounted export bills andservice related inflows includin_e earnings from tourism. Inaddition, the increase in the holdin-es of foreign assets of marketparticipants in view of the unceffainty in the foreign exchan,qemarket, could be another reason, The increase in domestic

assets was a result of the robust _growth in credit to the private

sector.

Credit to the private sector, which increased at a high rateof 22 per cent, was a major causal factor for the hi_eher thananticipated -qrowth of the monetary a,q_qre-qates in 2004. Theexpansion in credit from DBUs and FCBUs contributed to thisoverall expansion. The continued expansion in many sectorsfuelled by low interest rates contributed to expand credit to theprivate sector at a higher pace. A higher _qrowth in credit was

increase in interest rates. Meanwhile, credit to publiccorporations (i.e., mainly to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation(CPC)) from commercial banks increased by Rs. 5 billion, incontrast to a decline expected at the beginning of the year.On the liability side, deposits mobilised by LCBs grew by20 per cent in 2004 in comparison to l5 per cent in 2003,reflecting increased economic activity and the multiplication of

deposits and loans along with the expansion of reserve money.Foreign currency deposits recorded a higher increase of 24 per

cent, which was partly due to attractive interest rates offered bybanks in Sri Lanka. The increase in rupee deposits wasprimarily due to the increase in the time deposits category,which grew by 22per cent. Savin,{s deposits, which account for45 per cent of the total deposits, grew by l8 per cent.Meanwhile, borrowings under Repurchase transactions grewby about l2 per cent.

Sources and Uses of Funds of LCBs: On the source side,the main contribution came from deposits, which constituted85 per cent of the total resources mobilised, while the growthin deposits was 20 per cent in20fJ,4. The contribution of foreigncurrency deposits to the total growth in deposits was about2lper cent. Meanwhile, capital and reserves and foreignbonowings contributed to about 1.2 per cent and 2 per cent,respectively, of the growth in sources of funds in 2004.About 73 per cent of the resources mobilised in 2004 wasutilised to grant loans and advances. About 25 per cent of theincrease in resources was in the form of foreign balances.Meanwhile, investments in govemment securitie s declined byabout Rs. I8 billion. Commercial banks' reserves with theCentral Bank increased by Rs. l7 billion, reflecting theincreased statutory reserve requirement with the increase indeposit liabilities of commercial banks.

Of the total resources available to commercial banks as atend2004, the major share came from deposits (65 per cent),which include both rupee and foreign currency deposits. A

large part of the funds (44 pr cent) has been utilised to grant

loans and advances.Key Performance Indicators: In 2004, several keyperformance indicators exhibited continued resilience of the

banking sector. Capital funds in the banking sector improved

over the previous year. Although the rate of increase in capitalfunds was lower than in the previous year, capital in relation

to asset and net NPL ratios have increased. The overall profits

recorded an increase in 2004, but at a lower rate of around 8

per cent compared with the growth of 36 per cent recorded in

2003. This was partly due to the reduced growth in profits

earned tiom capital gains in comparison to the previous year

and a marginal decline in the interest rate spread. As profitgrowth was not commensurate with the expansion in the asset

base, there was some decline in the return on assets (ROA) and

the return on equity (ROE) in the overallbankin-{ sector duringthe year. With the recognition of such risks, many banks

focussed on risk identification and risk measurement in2004.whereby they improved the credit granting process and thefollow up process, along with an enhancement of the credit

management information systems.The interest spread, measured by the difference between

the interest yield and the interest cost, which is an indicator of

the etficiency of financial intermediation, was considered high

at around 4 percentage points in 2004, although it had declinedmarginally from the plevious year. The high interest spread in

the banking sector was the result of hi.eh operational costs,

high non-performing assets, mobilising long-term deposits atfixed rates, heavy reliance on interest earning activities as a

major source of income as opposed to fee based activities,legal and other procedural bottlenecks in dispute resolution,taxes and statutory costs as well as rigidities in the marketstructure. In order to reduce the interest spread by improvingmarket awareness, the Central Bank continued publishinglendin-e and deposit rates of banks and other main fees andcommissions char-eed by banks, which would help the publicto ne-eotiate the best terms with banks. In addition, banks wererequested to display lending rates and deposit rates at theirplaces of business. Another major contributory factor to thehigh interest rate spread has been hi_sh NPLs in the bankingsystem. The resolution of NPLs is often impeded by lengthyand cumbersome legal procedures, which also involve highcosts in addition to unsavoury political interference.Accordingly, the implimentation of the necessary le_qalretbrms and a more effective institutional framework, perhapswith the setting up of an asset management company as donein several countries, would be useful. Other possible measuresinclude offering competitive lending rates based on theprospects of projects and by properly assessing the quality ofcollateral, and promoting and developin-e the corporate bondmarket, given that the bond market could exert pressure onbanks to reduce their lendin-e rates through increasedcompetition in financial intermediation.Restructuring of the Trvo State Banks: TheGovernment, in Budget 2005, has committed itself to therestructuring of the two state banks to put them on a soundfinancial footing and make them commercially viableinstitutions in recognition of their predominant position in thetinancial system of Sri Lanka by virtue of their sizeable market

share and systemic importance.Both institutions have, accordingly, been brought underthe direct control of the Strategic Enterprises Management

A-qency (SEMA), which is responsible to the -{overnment fortheir restructuring programme.Bank of Ceylon (BOC) - A strategic plan has beenformulated by BOC, which outlines a restructurin_e programmeover a two year time frame for the achievement of certainbenchmark targets in the key areas of asset reconstruction,system upgrade, human resource development and capital

augmentation through internal generation of funds.The key areas identified are a dynamic managementinformation system (MIS) through the information technolo-Qy

upgrade and human resource development.BOC, intends to fill the void in its skills gap by recruitingskilled personnel in the areas of treasury risk management,internal audit and marketin-e and establish a solid structure for

succession at the senior management level. Towards this end,BOC is in the process of implementing thlee fully integratedinformation technology systems, which are expected toenhance the standards of service and operations of the bank.The roll-out to the branches has already commenced and willbe completed by mid 2006, resulting in the entire branchnetwork being linked to an on-line, real time, state of the art,

technology system.

People's Bank (PB) - A business restructurin-e plan(BRP) has been formulated by PB over a 5 year time horizon.This plan is drawn up on the basis of a capital infusionprogramme of a sum of US dollars 65 million throu-{h an ADBfunded credit line to the government.

As an integral part of its restructuring programme, PB hasdeveloped a five-year BRP under the supervision of SEMA,which has been approved by the Cabinet. The primary focus ofthe BRP is on the infusion of capital amounting to Rs. 8.5billion over a period of 05 years commencing from June 2005on a sta.qgered basis. The success of the plan is linked to theachievement of certain benchmarks in terms of staff and

business productivity in order to make PB commercially viable,

through the implementation of several measures to improve thecredit risk inanagement process of the bank and through assetreconstructlon.In order to make PB commercially viable, the bank intends

to divest the large hardcore NPLs either to an externally funded

asset management company (PBAMC) or to a special assetsdivision within PB.In addition, the plan targets the establishment of

management autonomy and the building up of a motivated andproductive workforce to retain its competitive edge within the

system.

Licensed Specialised Banks

LSBs consist of a diverse set of institutions including savin-es

banks, housin-e banks, development finance institutions (DFIs)

and re-eional development banks (RDBs). By end 2004, therewere 14 LSBs with a network of 406 branches, possessing l7

per cent of the total banking sector assets. The operations ofLSBs expanded further during 2004, although at a lower rate

than in 2003, with total assets increasing by I I per cent in 2004.

Part IChapter B - FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND STABILITY

Around 60 per cent of the loans approved were forhousing, industrial and financial sectors. Of these , the largest

share of credit was for housing purposes, in view of theincreased amount of credit granted by some LSBs, whichmainly cater to housing needs. The share of medium andlong-term loans (with a maturity of more than one year)

increased from about 80 per cent to 89 per cent during theperiod, partly because of the higher growth in housing loans

granted.The activities of the National Savings Bank (NSB)

expanded in terms of deposits mobilized and loans granted. Thedeposit base of NSB stood at Rs 180 billion, accounting for l7per cent of the combined total deposits of LCBs and LSBs.Although the two specialsed banks i.e., DFCC Bank and NDBstill held a dominant position with respect to loans granted, the

share of loans approved declined to 45.3 per cent of the total

loans approved in 2004 from 52.5 per cent in the previous year.NSB became the first LSB to receive the approval of the

Central Bank to accept NRFC and RFC accounts.

The total credit outstanding of LSBs increased by 15.6 per

cent to Rs. I I I billion by end 2004, with their, total advancesgrowing at a higher rate in 2004. However, profits declined in

2004 as against the considerable growth of profits in 2003.

Finance Companies

Finance companies (FCs) continued to concentrate theiractivities on hire purchase, leasing and lending for real estate

development. Total assets of FCs grew by 23 per cent (Rs. 12billion) in 2004 in comparison to the 20per cent (Rs. 9 billion)growth in 2003.In 2004, loans and advances granted by FCs increased by25 per cent. Hire purchase and leasin-e accounted for about twothirds of the overall resources raised in2004. Hire purchaseactivities grew at a faster rate in 2004 than leasing because of

the tax advantage on hire purchase. As a result, the growth ofcredit in relation to leasing activities decelerated to 8 per centin 2004, compared with a growth of 2l per cent in 2003.With respect to the sources of funds of FCs in 2004,

deposit mobilisation accounted for about 37 per cent and thegrowth in deposits was 14 per cent (Rs.5 billion). The higherinterest rates offered by finance companies for deposits in

comparison to the interest rates offered by commercial banks

and the rates of return pertaining to govemment securities, andsavers' preference to diversify their investments amongdifferent institutions with different risk profiles, contributed to

this increase. Capital funds of FCs grew by around 24per cent

and were 14 per cent of the sources of funds in 2004, whilebonowings from commercial banks accounted fbr around l3

per cent of the funds.

Other Financial InstitutionsPrimary Dealers: The number of primary dealers (PDs)

increased to l2 in 2004, with the addition of another non-bankprimary dealer. At present, the primary dealer system includes

licensed commercial banks as well, since banks were permitted

to become PDs in 2002. The total investment portfolio of theprimary dealer companies grew by 12 per cent in 2004 asagainst a growth of 38 per cent in 2003. The growth in2004was the result of the growth of the investment portfolio; thetrading portfolio declined during the year.At the end of 2004, capital funds of all PDs amounted roRs.4,922 million. The capital leverage ratio for all PDs wasI1.6 at end 2004, compared to the maximum permissible ratioof 20, indicating a healthy contribution by them to marketdevelopment. The return on equity for all PDs taken together,which was high in 2003, at 63.5 per cent, mainly as a result ofcapital gains due to the continuous decline in interest rates,

decreased to 14.5 per cent in 2004, as the declining trend in

interest rates reversed from around the end of November2003.Meanwhile, in order to improve investor awarehess andpopularise -government securities, PDs conducted several

awareness programmess in different parts of the country during

the year.

Specialised Leasing Companies: There were 65 leasingcompanies registered with the Central Bank by end 2004. Ofthese, 18 were specialised leasing companies, which areregistered with the Central Bank exclusively for leasing

business. The total outstanding leases of all registered leasingfirms increased to Rs. 80 billion from Rs. 66 billion at end

2003. The total assets of the specialised leasing companiesincreased to Rs. 34 billion from Rs. 25 billion at end 2003,while the total leases granted in2004 increased to Rs.18.2billion from Rs.l4.5 billion in 2003, which may be attributed

to the low interest rate regime. Though the finance leases are

the popular category of leasing, a few institutions engaged in

operational leasing as well.About 70 per cent of lease finance was absorbed by thetrade, services and transportation sectors. Passenger and

commercial vehicles were the main category of assets financed

by leasing, though its share in the total leasing granted declinedto 70 per cent in 2004 from 77 per cent in 2003. Meanwhile,

the share of leases for office equipment increased from 2 per

cent in 2003 to 7 per cent in the cunent year.

Part IChapter I - FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND STABILITY

Lease securitisation is one way in which long-term funds

are raised. However, the lease securitisation market is not well

developed, due to several factors such as legal impediments and

tax related issues. The proposed amendments to the Finance

Leasing Act may help overcome some of these difficulties.Merchant Banks: The performance of merchant banks,which generally specialise in fee based investment banking

activities, was adversely affected as a result of a few merchant

banks recordin-e declines in profits and assets. Their total assets

decreased to Rs.2l billion from2T billion at end 2003, whiletheir total income decreased from Rs. 2.8 billion to Rs. 2.4billion in 2004, [n2004, more than 60 per cent of their total

income was derived from leasing, lending and investments ingovernment securities. There were l0 merchant banks

operating in Sri Lanka by end 2004.Unit Trusts: The unit trust industry witnessed a wideningof its product range as a result of the entry of a money marketfund and a regulatory change permitting the establishment ofclose-ended funds.2 With the establishment of the money

market fund introduced by National Assets Management Ltd.(NAMAL), the total number of funds, managed by five

institutions, increased to 13, and the types of funds, i.e., growth,

balanced, indexed, income and money market, expanded tofive.

The net asset value of unit trusts grew by 16,7 per cent,

supported by an appreciation of the value of investments and

an increase in the number of units in issue. As a result, net

assets per unit increased by 9 per cent over the previous year,i,e., from Rs.ll .23 to Rs. 12.24. The main factor that

contributed to the increase in the net asset value was the bullrun in the stock market, which appreciated the value of theequity portfolio. The equity portfolio accounted for about 70per cent of the total investments. The share of investments inTreasury bills, the other main investment asset, increased due

to the entry of the money market fund, which primarily investsin Treasury bills. During the year, the total number of unit

holders decreased while the number of units in issue increased,indicating a marginal concentration of ownership in units.Venture Capital Firms (VCFs): VCFs, which areprimarily engaged in providing equity capital to high riskprojects, recorded a marginal drop in total assets, i.e., from Rs.

1.6 billion to Rs. 1,5 billion, as a result of many firms exitingfrom their projects, with the boom in the stock market. The

share of the VCFs was very small in terms of the total financial

sector assets. The firms had invested Rs. 680 million in 694projects, covering the agriculture, services and industrial

sectors, at end 2004. Since the development of venture capital

services is important as an alternative source of funding andexpanding investment, a package of incentives was granted

2 As against an open-ended fund, a close-ended fund is a time bounded fund with

a fixed number of units in issue, which are not kaded until the lapse of the timespecified. Since a close-ended fund is a form of a long-term inveslment, the only

exit mechanism available for an investor is through he stock exchange, providedthat lhe lund is lisled in lhe stock exchange.

through the government Budgets for 2003 and 2004 torevitalize the venture capital industry. These included a five-

year tax holiday and the setting up of a fund to develop the

venture capital industry.

Contractual Savings Institutions

Superannuation Funds: The total amount of savings collectedby superannuation funds, which include the Employees'

Provident Fund (EPF), the Employees' Trust Fund (ETF), thePublic Service Provident Fund (PSPF), the Contributory

Pension Fund (CPF) and approved private provident funds

amounted to Rs. 34 billion during the year, in comparison to

Rs. 30 billion moblised by LCBs, LSBs and finance companiescollectively.

Assets of the funds recorded a ll.7 per cent increase in2004 due to the combined effect of the general increase in

wages, net additions to the membership and the net investmentincome.The EPF, the largest retirement benefit fund in thecountry, expanded in terms of total assets, the membershipbase, investments and contributions received. The total

investment portfolio of the EPF was Rs. 359 billion by end

2004, with a major share of the portfolio consisting of Treasury

bonds (70 per cent). The net inflow of funds continued to bepositive, indicating that there is hardly any liquidity risk inmeeting members' requests for refunds. A return of 9.5 per

cent, on the member balances, was declared, as against 12 per

cent in 2003, which is higher than the commercial banks' oneyear fixed deposit rates of around 7.00 - 8.00 per cent and the

one-year Treasury bill rate prevalent during the same period.

The ETF recorded a similar pattern in investment, assetgrowth and contributions received. The fund had a net inflowof funds durin-e the year as a result of contributions received

being higher than refunds, despite its relatively flexible refundpolicy, where a member is able to withdraw his/ her balance

once in every 5 years when he/ she quits a job. The investmentportfolio, which is composed of government securities (91.4per cent), equities (3.7 per cent) and private sector debtinstruments (4,9 per cent), has undergone a portfolio

rebalancing in favour of government securities as a result ofinvestments in debentures maturing during the year. A returnof 10 per cent was declared by the ETF, on member balances,

as against ll per cent in 2003.The total assets of the PSPF, the CPF and private

provident funds amounted to Rs. 105 billion at end 2004.Insurance Companies: Both life and -eeneral insurancebusiness expanded significantly as a result of increasedcompetition, improved marketing and rising national income.

The number of insurance companies at end 2004 remained at

13. During the year, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation obtained

an AA- (sri) credit rating for its ability to meet policyholders'

obligations and benefits, becoming the first insurer to do so. It

was also given an A+(sri) national rating for its long term debt.The total premia collected increased from Rs. 19.3 billion in

2003 to Rs.24.4 billion in2004, supported by deregulation,product innovation and increasing per capita income levels in

the country. The total assets too increased by 20 per cent to Rs,

72 billion.Insurance penetration, measured in terms of the totalgross premium as a percenta.ee of GDP, improved fiom 1.4 percent at end 2003 to 1.5 per cent at end 2004, while insurancedensity or the per capita premium increased from Rs.1,240 toRs.l,5ll over the year, supported by both an increase in thenumber of policy holders and the raising of premia for valueadded products. Despite these improvements, insurancepenetration is still lower in Sri Lanka, when compared with theaverage insurance penetration of 3.6 per cent for emergingmarket countries.The insurance industry had paid Rs. 14.3 billion ascompensation, with respect to the tsunami rblated claims. Ofthe amount paid, Rs. I I billion was reclaimed from reinsurancecompanies. The total number of claims received in this regardunder all categories of insurance was 6,600. One negativefallout of the tsunami disaster with regard to the insuranceindustry could be a possible increase in the reinsurancepremium in the future, with the hei_ehtened natural disaster risk.On the policy front, there were two regulatory changes,namely, the imposition of a minimum solvency margin ongeneral insurance and initiating action to remove the limit onfire insurance premia, The solvency margin is a prudential

measure aimed at ensuring that a minimum level of capital ismaintained by insurance firms, whereas the removal of tariffrestrictions was to facilitate innovation and qualityimprovement by allowing tariffs to be determined by marketforces. The deregulation of limits on premia has led toincreased competition, resulting in the introduction ofinnovative products to suit the needs of difl'erent segments ofthe market.8.3 Developments in Financial Markets

Inter-Bank Call Money Market

The inter-bank call money market, which mainly servescommercial banks in meeting their immediate liquidity needsand reserve deficiencies, continued to remain liquid. Themarket liquidity surplus, which averaged around Rs. 7 - 8billion in December2003, declined to about Rs. 3 - 5 billion

by Au-eust 2004, particularly due to increased foreign exchange

sales by the Central Bank in order to contain excess volatilityin the domestic foreign exchange market. However, marketliquidity improved again during the second half of the year withpurchases of Treasury bills by the Central Bank and the sale ofthe proceeds of SLDBs and foreign loans to the Central Bankby the govemment.Activity in the inter-bank call money market increasedsignificantly during the second half of 2004, mainly due to theincreased liquidity needs of some banks with the higherexpansion of domestic credit. The total volume of lending (or

borrowin-e) in the call money market increased from Rs. 183.4

The average daily call money volume increasedfrom Rs. 2.I billion in the first quarter of 2004 to Rs. 7.0 billionin the fourth quarter of 2004. The average daily inter-banktransactions increased from Rs. 3.9 billion in 2003 to Rs. 5.6billion in 2004.As a result of the increased demand for liquidity bysome banks, the structural rigidities in the money market,the rise in inflation expectations, measures taken by theCentral Bank to absorb excess liquidity more a_qgressivelyin an attempt to contain the expansion in monetary

aggregates and the increase in the Central Bank policy rates,call money market rates rose during the year, and in someinstances moved above the upper bound of the interest ratecorridor.

Domestic Foreign Exchange Market

While the volume of transactions in the foreign exchangemarket increased, the exchange rate became volatile in2004.Trade related transactions and net inflows under the servicesand current transfers accounts increased during the year.Consequently, average daily inter-bank transactions, whichamounted to around US dollars l5 million in 2003, increasedfurther to around US dollars l7 million in2004. However, thewidening of the trade deficit and delays in receipts of someforeign loans as well as privatisation proceeds resulted insi-{nificant pressure on the exchange rate.

Government Securities MarketA notable development in the -qovernment debt securitiesmarket was the implementation of the SSS system forgovernment securities in February 2004, facilitating theissuance of government securities and the recording oftransactions in scripless form, thereby improving the efficiencyand reducing the risks involved.The amount raised in the primary Treasury bill marketincreased at a higher pace due to investor preference shiftin_eto short-term ,qovernment securities and an increase indomestic borrowing by the government. During the year, netissues of Treasury bills amounted to Rs. 24 billion as againstRs. 8 billion in 2003. With respect ro Treasury bills, themarket demonstrated a greater preference for 9l-dayTreasury bills. The outstanding Treasury bills, which was Rs.219 billion by end 2003 also increased ro Rs. 244brllionbyend 2004.During 2004, Treasury bonds of 2-year and 3-yearmaturities were issued regularly. As there were a largenumber of bond series in the market disturbing marketdevelopment, auctions were held to issue Treasury bonds ona remainin-e maturity basis to reduce the number of series inthe market. Continuing the process of market orientation ofthe issue of govemment securities, Rupee loan issues in 2004was limited to Rs. 564 million, while action was taken toretire callable Rupee loans, which canied a relatively higherrate of interest.The government raised US dollars 250 million through theissuance of SLDBs with a maturity penod of two years in 20M.These bonds were heavily oversubscribed and carried aninterest rate of six months LIBOR + 179 basis points.Due to the expectations of high interest rates, secondarymarket activitiy in government securities declined, especiallyduring the first seven months of the year. Secondary markettransactions of primary dealers in 2004 recorded a decline of10.5 per cent over the previous year. Primary dealers adopteda rather risk averse position, which resulted in an increase inmarket transactions in the shoft end, limiting transactions in thelong end. By end 2004, the secondary market yield curve forgovernment securities had shifted upwards compared with theyield curve in 2003.

Corporate Debt Securities Market

Commercial Paper (CP): The total amount of CP issued withthe support of LCBs and LSBs amounted ro Rs,14.5 billion in2004, compared with Rs. ll.l billion in 2003.3 There was,however, a drop in the volumes of CP issued, following theimposition of the witholding tax in November 2002 and thedecline in interest rates. The withholding tax, which wasapplicable to interest-bearing or discounted debt instrumentsincluding bonds, notes and mort_Qa-ees, will cease to be effectivefrom April 2005. From April 2005, only the final tax will be3 A bank may accept, endorde, guarantee, underwrite, purchase, be the issuingagent or the paying agent, in respect of commercial paper.

retained. This is likely to boost market activity in relationto CP.Corporate Bonds: There were two public issues ofcotporate bonds durin,{ 2004, which were subsequently listedon the Colombo Stock Exchan_ee (CSE). While Merchant Bankof Sri Lanka raised Rs.163.35 million in March by way of anissue of four-year debentures, Sampath Bank raised Rs.l.5billion in June by way of an issue of five-year debentures,mainly to fulfill capital adequacy requirements. In comparison,during 2003, a much higher amount of Rs.4.5 billion was raisedby way of issues of debentures, which were subsequently listedon the CSE. .Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) raised US dollars 100 million inNovember 2004by way of an international bond issue. Thesebonds, issued on 30 November 2004,and subsequently listed onthe Sin-eapore Stock Exchange, will mature in a single bullet atthe end offive years from the date ofissue. They carry a fixedsemi-annual coupon of 6.875 per cent per annum. This is thefirst dollar denominated fixed rate bond issue by a localcompany. SLT obtained ratings from both Fitch Ratings andStandard & Poor's for its foreign currency bond, prior to the

issue, which were both B+, denoting a stable outlook, While USdollars 50 million from the money raised was used by SLT tosettle loans it had obtained from the government, SLT expectsto expand its subsidiary Mobitel's network with the balancefunds.

Share market

Market activity at the CSE improved significanrly during 2004.This improvement was seen mainly during the latter half of theyear, after some volatility in market activity till around May,due to political uncertainty. The continued improvement incorporate profits, reflecting the improvement in economicactivity, stimulated secondary market activity at the CSE.Initial public offers (IPOs) made during the year, whichattracted both domestic funds and significant inflows of foreign

investment, also contributed to this improvement. The low

interest rate regime was another factor that impacted positively

on share market activity.Following these developments, by Z?December 2004, theAll Share Price Index (ASPI) reached 1,580.7, the highest up to

then, while market capitalisation exceeded Rs.400 billion for

the first time. During the last week of December 2004, however,

key market indicators retreated, which was partly attributed by

some market analysts to panic selling by investors considering

the damage caused by the tsunami in economic terms.

With respect to sectoralperformance, profits of companies

classified under most sectors improved significantly during the

year, having benefited from the continued growth momentum in

the domestic and external economies. The sector index for

Diversified Holdings, the largest sector, which accounted for 23

per cent of the market capitalisation by end-2004, increased by

63 per cent in 2004, reflecting the significant improvement in

the financial results posted by companies classified under the

sector. A significant development during the latter part of the

year was that, information with regard to the tourism industry,

which indicated strong performance by the industry in 2004, led

to increased buying interest in shares classified under the Hotels

and Travel sector. In the Power and Energy sector, shares of

Lanka IOC Ltd. were listed in December 2004, following its

IPO in November 2004,the biggest IPO in Sri Lanka up to now.A significant increase in the ASPI from around June 2004

raised doubts as to whether there was a build up of an asset

bubble. However, this increase was in Iine with corporateprofitability and other developments in the macroeconomy,Hence, the developments in the stock market cannot be

considered an asset bubble.

8.4 Development Finance and Access toFinance

Development Finance

During 2004, measures were taken to strengthen the micro,small and medium scale industries and enterprises of the

country through awareness programmes and the improvementof the credit delivery mechanism, The Rural Finance Sector

Development Project (RFSDP) funded by the Asian

Development Bank (ADB) commenced its operations during

the year. In the first phase of the project, it was expected to

create a conducive environment for rural finance sectorinstitutions to carry out sustainable operations by assisting

them through training, consultancy and introducing changes to

the legal structure.

Other key areas identified to be addressed by the Project

are strengthening of the Rural Finance Institutions (RFIs),

supervision of RFIs and outreach expansion, Banks and other

RFIs continued to expand their micro credit operations in the

North and the East during the year. Two commercial banksjoined the Central Bank to expand micro credit programmes to

the North and the East with the assistance of Japan Bank for

International Co-operation (JBIC) in the latter paft of the year.

Microfinance delivery systems were improved with theinvolvement of a large number of lending institutions in the

sector and by linking Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) with

formal banking institutions. The microfinance schemes were

implemented by the leading domestic private banks using their

own funds and with the support of donor funds, during the year.The operations of the two microfinance programmes

implemented by the Central Bank; the Small Farmers and the

Landless Credit Project (SFLCP - ISURU) and the PovertyAlleviation and Microfinance Project (PAMP), covering 10

districts, continued through a network of leading microfinancedelivery institutions. Cultivation loans granted under the New

Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS) showed a

remarkable expansion throughout the country. During 2004, the

interest subsidy provided to lending banks by the govemment

under the NCRCS was reduced from 8 per cent to 6 per centwhile the on lending rate remained unchanged at 8 per cent per

annum. The government, recognizing the Forward Sales

Contract System (FSCS) as a successful mechanism to ensure

a remunerative price for farmers, enhanced the upper limit of

the marketing loans under the FSCS, from Rs.5 million to

Rs.25 million per bonower.During the year, all six RDBs registered a satisfactoryperformance in all the important areas of financialintermediation while maintaining single digit net non-performing loan ratios. Furthermore, all RDBs becameprofitable ventures and provided funds to micro and small

enterprises in their respective regions.

Enhancement of Access to Finance

With a view to enhancing income generating activity through

There were 14 micro finance and other credit schemesoperated by the Central Bank with an outstanding loan balanceof Rs. 9.6 billion as at the end of 2004. In addition. there wasa number of rnicro finance schemes being operated by banksand non-governmental organizations.Several policy measures were implemented in 2004 toimprove the financial system and to enhance the access tofinance. During the year, a license was granted to agovernment-owned SME bank to operate as an LSB tospecially cater to the needs of the smalland medium enterprisessector. The SME Bank, a proposal in the Budget 2005, was setup in March 2005. The Central Bank launched a concessionaryrefinance credit scheme "susahana" with an initial fundingallocation of Rs. 5 billion to assist micro, small and mediumscale enterprises affected by the tsunami disaster.Action has been taken to amend the Credit InformationBureau Act to enable it to maintain credit information of SMEsand micro enterprises. In order to enhance the mobilization ofrural savings, it has been proposed to link the postal savingsoutlets (4,048 outlets at present) on-line to the branches of theNSB. Banks have been requested by the FSC to set up projectconsultancy units to assist SMEs in obtaining credit facilitiesfrom the banking system.

In addition, rheAutomated General Ledger System and the Treasury DealingRoom Management System (TDRMS) of the Central Bankwere completed in 2003.LankaClear (Pvt.) Ltd. (LCPL) initiated a Cheque Imaging

and Truncation (CIT) Project in2004. This is an image-basedcheque clearing system, which would replace the physical

cheque flow, with an electronic information flow throughout

the clearing cycle. This process eliminates the actual chequemovements, thereby reducing the delays associated with themovement of cheques. The CIT project will increase efficiency,reduce the operational cost and expedite the clearing process.To strengthen the legal infrastructure relating to retailpayments and the acceptance of electronic presentment ofcheques, the Central Bank initiated the drafting of a Payments

and Settlement Systems law in 2004. The draft law is expectedto be presented to the Parliament in 2005.Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system: The highvalue inter-bank payments and settlement system in SriLankaknown as the RTGS System, completed its first year ofoperations successfully during the year under review.During the year, the RTGS system settled 138,119' transactions worth Rs.13,701 billion (as high as 7 times theGDP), among direct participating institutions (including the

Cheque Imaging

In modern money economies, cheque is the most commonly

used mode of payment, apart from cash. In Sri Lanka,

cheques are used for effecting low value retail payments and

clearance is done by an automated clearing house operatedby LankaClear Ltd. In the clearing process, physical

cheques presented to banks are sent to LankaClear, which

in turn sorts and distributes the same to the receiving bank/

branch, in addition to effecting the payment and settlement,This process takes around l-7 days (upto 7 in unclearcd

areas in the Northern and Eastern provinces) depending on

the locations of the presenting and receiving banks due to

the time taken for transporting the cheques using courier

servlces.Any efflcient cheque payment system should reduce

the delays, associated transaction costs and operational and

systemic risks to a minimum level. In this senset the presentphysical cheque transf-er system needs further substanlial

improvements. The sugge.sted solution has been to resortin-eto a cheque imaging and truncation system.ln cheque imaging, the image of the physical cheque

is captured and will be converted to a di-eital form that a

computer can read throu.eh conversion of differences incolouring and shading on the surface of the cheque. The

physical cheque rvill be held at the image capturin-t point,

a regional collection centre or at the presenting bank/branchif the images are sent directly to the Central Processin-u

Mana-gement Unit, The ima,ees captured is transmitted

through communication lines to the main clearing centre torsorting of images instead of the present practice of the

physical cheque bein-e sorted at LankaClear, thus truncating

its physical movement at the source itself which is either the

Regional Centre or the presenting bank. The sorted imageswill be transmitted to the receiving banks through the same

communication lines which will significantly reduce the

time taken, an improvement of the present system.

LankaClear has embarked on a Cheque lmaging andTruncation Project(CITP) which is expected to be

implemented by September 2005. The project is jointly

handled by LankaClear and Central Bank of Sri Lanka,Accordingly, the Hardware for the project is funded by

Central Bank of Sri Lanka while the sofiware is funded by

LankaClear.

Under the new system, ten regional clearing centres forcollection of physical cheques and for image capturing

purposes. The Regional Service Bureaus will be located inJaffna, Anuradhapura, Ampara, Badulla, Kandy,Polonnaruwa, Kurunegala, Nuwaraeliya, Rathnapura,

Matara and Colombo. Hence, it is envisaged that the cheque

clearing process for all regions will be reduced to one day

cheque clearing system:(i) lmage Friendly ChequesA lighter plain back-eround colour has been introduced to

the cheque leaf to ensure readability of the image as thephysical cheque will not be available lor presentation.Banks have already commenced distribution of imagefi'iendly cheques to customers.(ii) Cheque SizeThe present practice of having two sizes of chcques

separately for corpt-rrate and personal customers will be

replaced with a single size at J" x3 112". There willbe nochange in the format of the Magnetic Ink Character

Recognition (MICR) line. The Image of both fiont and the

back of the cheque will be captured throu-sh the system.(iii) lmage Return Document (lRD)

IRD will replace the original cheques fbr the purpose of re-

presentment for clearing under the CIT systen and rvill

serve as the notice of dishonour. IRD includes the imngeof the returned cheque and all other relevant infbrmation

along with the reason fbr rqection. The receivin-e banks willidentify the images of cheque returns and transmit the

images to the Main Clearing centre, which will tonvard the

retum images to the presenting Regional Centre or the bank.

For all retumed cheque images, IRD will be printed at the

point of capturing of the image, which is either the Regional

Centre or the presenting bank. An IRD could be presentedonly up to a maximum of 2 times within a period of 6

months after the first pre sentation. IRD will completely

eradicate the physical flow of the paper based cheque which

is truncated at the presenting bank/branch or at Regional

Centre level,

Benefits of CIT

Introduction of CIT will generate benefits to both banks and

to customers, It will reduce risks, delays, loss of cheques

in transit and facilitate electronic validation of informationin the cheque. Further, it will significantly reduce the

realisation time for outstation cheques. Ability to centrallyarchive the images will reduce retrieval time of past

information and expedite query handling, The banks will' also benefit throu-eh efficiency of cheque clearing

operations, reduction of costs associated with physical

handling and transportation of cheques, automatic postingof accounts and signature verifications. This will also

reduce the opportunity for frauds and enable banks to

centralise their operations.

the ILF during 2004.Scripless Securities Settlement (SSS) System: Theactivities of the SSS system commenced operations on 03February 2004. AII the new issues of Treasury bills andTreasury bonds were in scripless form since 30 January 2004

and a majority of government securities that had been issued

in scrip form were converted to scripless form. The total valueof scripless securities held in LankaSecure reached Rs.796billion by the end of 2004. These securities comprised of

Treasury bills amounting to Rs. 240 billion and Treasury bondsamounting Rs. 556 billion. The total number of beneficiary

accounts relating to the poftfolios of individual and corporatecustomers maintained at LankaSecure through directparticipants at the end of 2004 was 23,317.

Legislative Reforms

In order to keep pace with the developments in the financial

markets, the Central bank continued its efforts to review the

existing legal framework, while introducing new legislation. In2004, the Central Bank introduced a system for the electronic

issue, transfer and recording of government and Central Bank

securities and an electronic real time gross settlement systemfor large value payments between banks and other participantsin the system.Legislative changes required to implement the real timegross settlement system were introduced by amending theMonetary Law Act in2002. Extensive changes in the RSSO

and the LTBO were requird to implement the SSS system.

These changes were introduced in 2004by way of amendmentsto the two Ordinances.The legal issues that arose in transiting from scrip basedgovernment securities to electronic securities included issues

relating to recording and transfer of title and modes of canying

out other transactions (e.9. pledges). Additionally, as all records

are maintained electronically, the legal validity of such records

had to be strengthened. Accordingly, the changes introduced to

the RSSO and the LTBO in2D4provide for, among others, the

establishment and the maintenance of a central depository in

the Central Bank to maintain records of title and other interestsin scripless securities, strengthening the legal validity ofelectronic records and the increase of fines applicable to

offences committed under the Act to enable such fines to be

based on the monetary gain made or loss incuned on accountof the offence.

Regulation and Supervision

The Central Bank, which supervises and regulates all majorinstitutions in the financial sector, focused more on the risk

management aspects to improve stability of the financial sector.

The institutions supervised and regulated by the Central Bankinclude LCBs, LSBs, registered finance companies and PDs.

The Central Bank also oversees the payments and settlementsystem and registers and monitors finance leasing

establishments. In addition, the Central Bank regulates money

changers and manages the EPF. The Securities and Exchange

Commission (SEC) is responsible for licensing and regulating

the stock exchange, stock brokers and unit trust companies. The

SEC also registers underwriters, margin providers, credit rating

agencies, investment managers and securities clearing houses.The Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL) regulates the

insurance industry with a view to safeguarding the interests of

the policy holders.The Central Bank supervises and regulates financialinstitutions through both off-site surveillance and on-site

examinations, based on a risk-based supervisory approach, toidentify the risks faced by these institutions and monitor theirrisk management strategies, in order to ensure that the risks

undertaken by these institutions are commensurate with their

resource profiles. These activities were further strengthenedthrough continuous dialogue with market participants. With

regard to the banking sector, a number of prudential directions

and guidelines were issued in2004 to strengthen further theregulatory and supervisory framework. The major changes

implemented were the computation of the capital adequacyratio on a consolidated basis, the issuing of guidelines toexternal auditors, requiring statutory Iiquid assets to bemaintained in US dollars in respect of the FCBU separately,removing restrictions in relation to the payment of interest bycommercial banks where more than four withdrawals have

been made during a month and improving the classification of

bad and doubtful advances for provisioning purposes. Further,measures were also taken to create awareness about the

new Basel Capital Accord among the banking institutionsAlthough, new regulations were not issued in relation tothe operations of linance companies, two directions were

issued in relation to the activities of the PDs. A direction wasissued to PDs to prevent short selling of securities, i.e.,selling of securities without actually holding the relevantsecurities in their portfolio, to counteract high marketvolatility. Another direction was issued to prevent PDs fromhaving adjusted trading or using away prices for recordingtheir transactions.

The New Basel Capital Accord

The new capital accord formulated by the Basel

Committee titled "International Convergence of CapitalMeasurement and Capital Standards: a Revised

Framework (Basel II;':, lntludes new options availableto supervisors and banks for assessing capital adequacy.

Basel II incorporates much of the latest "technology" inthe financial arena for managing risk: and allocating

capital to cover risk. The new accord is more extensive

and complex than the existing accord, which has been inforce since 1988, The ultimate goal of Basel II is to

strengthen financial systems, both in the Basel Committee

member countries and elsewhere. The revised frameworkoffers a range of options fiom which supervisors may

choose. The most sophisticated options require extensive

preparation and adequate resource allocation on the partof both banks and their supervisory authorities. The New

Accord, will be introduced from year 2007.The new Accord is based on three ipillars': capital

requirements, supervisory revibw, and market discipline. In

Pillar I, the capital requirements are based on banks' own

measurement of risks. The new framework is based on the

premise that discipline by the markets and by supervisors

is beneficial,, Basel II not only promotes improvements in risk

management and regulatory capital allocation but also raisesa variety of implementational challenges for both

supervisors and banks. The bankin-e supervisory community

has been focusing agreat deal in the recent past on changes

to the existing capital accord (Basel t). The new Accord,while affecting capital regulation, will also influence theway in which banking supervision is Conceived and

conducted. Basel II is also based on the understanding that

minimum capital requirements are in themselves not enoughto ensure a safe and sound banking system. The newframework will be more comprehensive and sensitive tobanking risks than the current Capital Accord. The

emphasis will be put on banks' own assessments of risks,

and incentives will be provided to banks to further improvetheir risk measurement and management systems. To

achieve these goals, Basel II is structured on three mutuallyreinforcing pillars as mentioned above.

Pillar I: Minimum capital requirements include capital

charges for credit risk and operational risk, in addition to the

capital charges for market risk established in 1996. Pillar Iprovides an evolutionary structure for the calculation of

these capital charges: that is, banks with a greater level of

sophistication arie allowed to use increasingly advanced

methodologies, For credit risk, this evolutionary structure

includes the standardized approach, conceptually similar to

the 1988 Capital Accord, although allowin-e a greater degree

of risk weight differentiation based on external ratings, and

the inte approach, which relies onbanks' e components that define

the risk, The IRB approach, in turn, comprises two differentmethodologies: the foundation and advanced IRB

approaches, depending on the sophistication of riskmanagement systems of the banks. A similar structureI ;:'J;;T,:J;:;t techniques and

new rules for the treatment of asset securitization.The new capital adequacy proposals are geared to

broadly maintaining the current level of re.eu tal

in the global financial system, and do not inte or

lower the overall level of capital requirements. However,these may increase or decrease for individual banks

depending on their risk profiles. As the proposals are morefinely attuned to banking risks, banki with good risk

management systems and/or low risk profiles, may have

lower capital requirements, and is thus an incentive to move

towards better risk management systems and practices.

Pillar II: The supervisory review process, closely linked

to the Basel Core Principles, goes beyond verifying that

banks comply with minimum capital requirements, and

ensures that banks' capital is aligned with their Ievel of riskand degree of sophistication. Pillar II is based on fourprinciples: (i) the bank is primarily responsible for

calculating and maintaining a proper level of capital; (ii)

supervisors have the ability to evaluate banks' internal

capital adequacy measures; (iii) supervisors have the ability

to require banks to hold capital above the minimum when

they estimate that capital levels are not adequate; and (iv)

supervisors have the ability to intervene at an early stage

and enforce remedial actions if bank capital falls below

prudential levels.Pillar III: Market discipline is a powerful tool that

introduces strong incentives for banks to put in place safe

and sound risk management policies and practices, Pillar III

:

focuses on the core disclosures relevant to exercise etfectivemarket discipline: asset quality, amount of capital, riskprofile and capital adequacy, as well as information on thedetails of internal systems of banks adopting the IRts

approach.Pillar II implies significant additional responsibilitiesfor supervisors, including; for instance, evaluatin-e banks'internal capital assessment processes or selecting which

credit rating agencies are acceptable.

138Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2004

Part IChapter I - FINANGIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND STABtLtTy

Pillar III puts increased emphasis on marketdiscipline and requires banks to disclose moreinfbrmation. Supervisors will need adequate powers toensure that banks' management disclose appropriate andaccurate information.Much of the complexity of the new accord stemsfrom the diversity existing in the real world. Byproviding a range of options the new Accord tries toalign the re-gulatory framework to each bank's riskprofile, In developing Basel II, the Basel Commitreesought to balance simplicity and risk sensitivity. Thisbalance is particularly difficult in an indusrry likebankin-q, where a culture of constant innovation makesit a tall order for regulators to develop simple rules thatfit all banking products and services.Compatible with the Central Bank of SriLanka's goal to have consistency and harmony withinternational standards and its approach to adapt to apace that is appropriate in the conteir of countiyspecific needs, the Central Bank has accepted, in

principle, to adopt the nel capital accord. Banks in SriLanka have been required to do a self-assessment on theimplications of Basel II on their respective banks for aplan of mi_qration by January 2001. The Central Bankwill be closely monitorin_e the progress made by banksin this direction. At a minimum all banks in Sri Lanka,to begin with, will adopt the Standardized Approach forcredit risk together with an explicit capital charge formarket risk and operational risk. After adequate skillsare developed, both in banks and at the supervisory level,some banks may be allowed to migrate to the IRBApproach.Amon,{ the banks in Sri Lanka, the degree ofsophistication in terms of risk management practicesdiffers with banks from G-10 countries. The degree ofreadiness for Basel II compliance antong banks in SriLanka differs widely, Some banks have initiated theprocess of collecting risk data and even have some yearsof risk data in place while, others are still to commencetheir preparation for Basel IL

Credit Rating and Credit Information

The Budget 2004 made it mandatory for all deposit takinginstitutions operating in Sri Lanka to obtain an entity ratin_9fiom an approved credit ratin_e agency and publish such rating.Credit ratings are also now mandatory for issues of all varietiesof debt instruments where the value exceeds Rs. 100 millionexcept for those issued by the government.

Banks operating in SriLanka have been advised to obtainand publicise a ratin-e betbre end June 2005. By end-February2045,20 financial institutions had published credit ratingsobtained from Fitch Ratings Lanka Ltd., which continues to bethe only credit rating company operating in Sri Lanka.Among these were I I commercialbanks, including one foreignbank, 6 specialised banks one finance company, one primary

dealer and one leasing company. Most forei_qn banks operatin-ein Sri Lanka had submitted the rating obtained by the parentbank.The Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka (CRIB)collects and collates infbrmation on borrowers and fumishessuch information to its shareholding institutions. Its majorshareholder is the Central Bank, which holds 49 per cent of theissued share capital, while commercial banks, specialisedbanks, regional development banks, re_eistered financecompanies, leasin_t companies and the National DevelopmentTrust Fund hold the balance share capital. While the CRIBcontinued to collect information on re.{ular advances of Rs.500,000 and over and inegular advances of Rs. 100,000 andover, there were 89 reportin_e institutions by 2004.

The CRIB issued 501,176 credit reporrs in 2004,an increase of 29 per cent in comparison to the 389,171reports issued in 2003. While this increase reflects the hrgherdemand for credit along with the continued recovery ineconomic activity, it also demonstrates that credit informationis used as an important risk mana_{ement tool by lendinginstitutions.

It has been proposed to amend the CRIB Act to enable the

use of credit infbrmation more widely and effectively in orderto improve access to finance and reduce credit risk.

8.6 Financial System Stability

Financial stability encompasses stability in the macroeconomicenvironment, soundness of the users of the financial system andthe systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) andstability in markets and soundness of infrastructure. A stablefinancial system fosters a stable payments and settlementsystem, facilitatin_Q the smooth functionin_e of economicactivities of a country. Maintaining financial system stabilityis one of the two major objectives of the Central Bankfollowing the amendments made to the Monetary Law Act in2002.In 2004, domestic and external macroeconomicdevelopments did not pose major risks to the maintenance ofstability in the financial system. However, increasedimbalances on the monetary and fiscal fronts as reflected by thehigh private sector credit growth, rising inf'lation and excessivegovernment bonowing from the domestic market could havean impact on the risk levels in the future.

Pyramid Schemes

A "Pyramid Scheme" is defined as a plan, scheme or any

program of action under wliich a person makes an investment

to get the right to recruit others into the scheme for which he

receives a consideration (money or an1;riting of value); and, the

new recruits also make an investment'i,r pct the right to furtherrecruit and receive consideration fur getting others to

participate, Such a scheme is called a pyramid scheme because;

over time a hierarchy of participants resembling a pyramid isformed with the introduction of new and large layers of

participants to the scheme.

The Operation of Pyramid Schemes

Pyramid schemes exploit the greed of individuals with limited

knowledge of business who are duped to believe that they

could ge t rich quickly with minimum effort earning incomesthat would grow exponentially with the expansion of thepyramid as indicated below:

Suppose a person recruiting l0 new participants at thefirst level receives a payoff of Rs,l0 and continues to receive

payoffs with the growth of the pyramid, the pyramid will have

the followirrs structure;

Economic lmpact of Pyramid Schemes

Due to adverse impact of pyramid schemes on tlie ecoromy,

many cour.ltries have taken ste ps to prohibit such schemes bylaw. One of the dangers to the economy where there is wide

scale participation in these schemes is that the wealth

distributiorr is drastically altered with a few persons receivirig

huge payoffs. Tlie widespread uttearned income in this manner

promotes rent seeking desires of individuals which are

considered as directly unproductive economic activities. In

addition, a pyramid scheme which is operated from abroadwould result in a large capital outflow causing either a

depreciation of the currency or a drop in official reserves.

Finally and perhaps tlte most important from the point of view

of a central bank, is the danger of persons using borrowed funds

(including funds drawn through credit cards) to participate in

pyramid type schemes rvith tlte expectation of paying back

loans from their returtrs. The collapse of pyramid schemeswould result in large scale default by borrowers and could

destabilize the flrnancial sector.

Prevention of Pyramid Schemes

In the rbsence of any preventive legal status, the Central Bank

of Sri Lanka took upon itself the task of educating the public

of the risk and futility of joining pyramid schemes when there

was evidence that one such scheme was operating in the

country in the guise of a network marketer. The provisions of

the Exchange Control Act were also used to deter individuals

from using credit cards to make out payments. While tlris was

successful in containing the spread of scheme, Iegal status was

afforded to the Bank by amending the Banking Act by

prohibiting the en-eagement in pyramid schemes as follows:

No person shall directlv or indirectLv initiate, offer,

As the promoters of such a pyramid scheme explain once

a pay-otf of Rs.l l,l I l,l10. However, at the 7'r' layer the

number of recruits have already reached l0 million. Given acountry of the size of Sri Lanka it is unlikely that such a

losses on -qovernment security trading, despite the gains from

a l3 per cent increase in interest income and the lower increasesin non-interest expenses and loan loss provisions.Meanlvhile , in 2004, capital funds of LCBs increased inabsolute terms. The rate of increase in capital f unds was 22percent in2004 as against 4l percent in 2003. The ratio ofcapital to net NPLs (NPLs net of provisions) increasedsi-enificantly over the previous year, providing a greatercapacity to absorb losses. However, the Capital AdequacyRatio (CAR), the ratio of capital funds to risk weighted assets,declined from 10.4 percent as at end 2003 to 9.1 per cent as at

end 2004. mainly due to the effect of the negative net worth of

one bank. It was below the regulatory minimum for CAR of l0per cent, but above the international minimum of 8 per cent.Furthermore, the core CAR, which mainly consists of owners'capital, was 8.2 per cent, compared to the regulatory minimumof 5 per cent. As these requirements are the minimum, it isprudent for banks to improve further their capital in order tomeet potential adverse shocks successfully. However, capitalfunds of LSBs increased by 16.2 per cent in2004 as against a23.5 per cent increase in 2003, despite the decline in profits.Similarly, the level of capital in relation to assets, loans, NPLsand deposits too improved in LSBs. As at end 2004, capitalfunds were adequate to cover 32 per cent of the total loanportfolio and more than twice the level of NPLs, implying alower risk in relation to external shocks. Registered tinancecompanies also recorded an improvement in terms of profits

and capital in 2004.

Financial sector infrastructure, consisting of payments andsettlement systems, the supervisory and regulatory re-gime, andthe legal framework, further improved in2004. With re_eard tothe payments and settlement system, the newly introducedRTGS would help reduce settlement risks. The supervisory andregulatory framework too strengthened with the imposition ofnew prudential re,eulations, The le_gal system relating to thefinancial sector was reformed with a view to improving thestability of the financial sector.As almost the entirety of the investments of the EPF wasin government securities, the EPF faces a relatively lorv risklevel. Moreover, since its receipts continued to be greater than

the cash outf'lows, it did not face a liquidity risk. However, withthe new accountin_e policy of the fund, it now faces anincreasin_ely high interest rate risk, which has ro be mitigatedby appropliate measures such as buildin_e up reserves.Within financial markets, althou_eh the stock market grewat a hi-eher pace, it would not pose a threat to stability. Thesubstantial increase in prices in the share market was consistentwith the fundamentals of the corporate sector and hence did notindicate a risk of an asset price bubble situation.During the year, the Central Bank took several legal andregulatory measures to improve and stren.ethen the soundnessand stability of the financial system, They include increasingthe minimum capital to l0 per cent of risk weighted assets,

SIFIs, which include LCBs, LSBs, FC's, and the EPF. holdabout 72 per cent of the financial assets. Their financial healthrernained satisfactory in2004 as reflected by major indicators.Major risks impacting on SIFIs are credit or default risk,liquidity risk, market risk and operarionalrisk. The stability andsoundness of the SIFIs strengthend, reducing the overallsystemic risk. This was reflected in the decline in nonperformin_q loans, increases in capital funds, loan lossprovisions and the level of liquid assets. The credit risk, asmeasured by the NPL ratio of LCBs, declined to 10 per cent in2004 from 14 per cent in 2003. The credit risk furrher declinedas the level of loan loss provisions improved to 6l per cent oftotal NPLs fiom 58 per cenr in 2003.Generally, capital and earnin.gs reflect the capacity of aninstitution to absorb extemal shocks. Capital and pre-tax profitsof the SIFIs recorded an improvement in 2004. However, theafier tax profits of LCBs decreased in2004, as a result of adecline in the interest spread, an increase in non interestexpenses, and a decline in non-interest income as a result ofcapital losses from -eovernment security holdin_es. Theprofitability of LCBs, as measul'ed bi, the Return on Assets(ROA) and Retum on Equity (ROE), roo declined. Profitabilityof LSBs also declined as a results of a signiticant decline innon-interest income, i.e., by 29 percent, arising from capital

the imposition of a mandatory credit rating requirement, theconsolidation of the liquid asset ratio at 20 per cent, the

tightening of the requirements in relation to external auditors

and the imposition of an additional provisioning requirementto cover tsunami affected loans. To strengthen the legal

infrastructure relating to retail payments and the acceptanceof electronic presentment of cheques, the Central Bank

initiated drafting a Payments and Settlement Systems bill in

2004. Furthermore, the amendments to the Banking Act.which were passed in Parliament in 2004, will help

strengthen financial stability through a further tightening ofprudential regulations and the removal of legal deficiencies.The risks in the payments system were reduced with the

establishment of a payments system oversight unit for the

supervision of the RTGS, and the preparation of the business

continuity plans for LCBs.There are several downside risks, which could affectfinancial system stability in 2005. The world economic

environment, though favourable at present, could become

uncertain with the slowing down of global economic growth,

the continuin-e uncertainties in relation to petroleum prices,international interest rates moving upward with the removalof policy stimuli, and the continuation of the significantlylarge destabilising twin deficits, i.e., the fiscal and the

external current account deficits, in the USA. The domestic

economic environment would face the risks of continuinguncertainty in relation to inflation, aid flows, fuel prices,

and international trade, arising from the fall out eft'ects ofthe termination of the MFA, and difficulties in achievin-efiscal consolidation as required. The high credit expansioncould also become a threat, if appropriate measures are not

taken to ensure the accepted levels of asset quality. However,the sector wili be able to manage those risks successfullywith the continuing strengthening of the financial positionand the improved risk management strategies, the

sttengthening of the regulatory and supervisory tiameworkand the improvements in the payments and settlement

systems.
