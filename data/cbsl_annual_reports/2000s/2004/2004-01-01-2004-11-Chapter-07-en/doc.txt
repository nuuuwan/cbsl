MONETARY pOLlCy MONEY, CREDIT AND INTEREST RATES

7.1 Overview

The focus of monetary policy in 2004 was on the need forminimizing inflationary pressures, while facilitating thecontinuing growth momentum in the economy. This was a

challen,eing task given the difficult domestic and external

environments brou-qht about by the weather related domestic

supply disturbances and the escalation of international oil

prices, causing both balance of payments difficulties and

upward pressure on prices. Monetary expansion has, however,

been somewhat above the desired path, particularly after mid

2004, driven mainly by the hi-sher expansion in credit to the

private and public sectors. In response, the Central Bank further

tightened the already somewhat tight monetary policy stanceby implementing open market operaticis more aggressively

and raising its policy rates. The higher demand for credit, some

increase in inflationary expectations and the movement of

poticy rates led to a moderate increase in market interest rates

during the year. Interest rates applicable to foreign currency

deposits and lending also increased as major economies

commenced withdrawing their monetary policy stimuli

gradually to abate fears of rising inflation.

7.2 Monetary Policy

The Central Bank continued to conduct its monetary policy

under an independently floating exchange rate re-eime within

a framework of targeting monetary a-qgregates with reserve

money (i.e., high powered money) as the operating target and

broad money (Mrn) as the intermediate target. Monetary policy

was implemented with a system consistin-e of active open

marke t operations (OMO), which includes, as its main

component, the interest rate conidor formed by the Repurchase

rate and the Reverse Repurchase rate, and the continuation of

the statutory reserve requirement.

The conduct of monetary management was challen-qing in

2004 given the need to support the growth momentum in adifficult macroeconomic environment created by several

adverse external and domestic factors, while paying due

attention to bur-Qeonin-e inflationary pressures in the economy'

Thus, the thrust of monetary policy was placed on containin-t

growth rates of reserve money and broad money, which are

operating and intermediate tar,eets in monetary management,

respectively, at desired levels, by making adjustments to policyrates and continuing active OMO. This effort was

supplemented by maintaining the Statutory Reserve Ratio

(SRR) unchanged at l0 per cent, and the Bank Rate at l5 per

cent. In the context of sales of foreign reserves by the Central

Bank to mitigate excessive volatility in the exchange rate,

money market liquidity was maintained by injecting fundsthrough Central Bank purchases of Treasury bills in the

primary and secondary markets, in order to prevent a liquidity

crunch and wider fluctuations in interest rates.

The -qradual reduction in interest rates durin-e the period

2001-2003 provided the necessary impetus to the recovery in

economic activities from the economic contraction in 2001. As

the economic recovery stren-{thened, the continuation of thelow interest rate regime, despite rising inflation, induced ahigher growth in private sector credit. The increased budgetdeficit raised the government's borrowing requirement. The

delays in the receipts of official forei,en inflows coupled with

high oil prices, increased government deficit financing through

domestic sources more than the increase in the fiscal deficit,while exerting pressure on the balance of payments. This, in

turn, exefted pressure on the exchange rate and interest rates.

The pressure on the exchange rate necessitated intervention by

the Central Bank in the foreign exchange market, which led to

a reduction in net forei-9n assets (NFA) of the Central Bank-

The resulting liquidity contraction was offset by injecting rupeeliquidity, raising net domestic assets (NDA) of the Central

Bank. NDA of the banking system (i.e. the Central Bank andcommercial banks) surged further with the increased

government borrowin,gs from the domestic market, as the

available resources in the non-banking sector were limited'

Consequently, monetary expansion continued to remain above

the targeted path in 2004.

The difficult economic conditions that prevailed in 2004

required proper timing and sequencing of monetary policy

tightening. Accordingly, as the flrst step, the Central Bank

conducted OMO aggressively flom June by absorbing almost

the entire liquidity surplus in the money market through daily

auctions, which induced an upward adjustment in the shoft termcost of funds, so as to contain the growth in monetary

aggregates. Subsequently, it was supplemented by raisin-e the

Central Bank policy rates by 50 basis points in November2004-

Meanwhile, to contain the higher demand fol import credit and

to discourage vehicle imports in an already glutted market, a

100 per cent margin deposit requirement against letters of credit

(LCs) opened with commercial banks for the importation of

motor vehicles for private use was introduced, as a temporary

measure.The Central Bank implemented a relief packa-ee by

-sranting loans through the banking system at concessionary

rates to help the economy to recover from the impact of the

tsunami disaster. This involved taking measures to keep themoney market liquid and to ensure the smooth functioning ofthe tjnancial markets and the payments and settlement system.In this re-9ard, daily OMO auctions vvere temporarily suspendedin early January 2005. The auctions were subsequently resumedin February 2005. The Central Bank continued to en_ea-ee in adialogue with financial institutions to meet the urgent financialneeds of those affected and ensure an uninterrupted flow offinancial services.The CentralBank continued to enhance the disseminationof information on monetary policy to make monetary policyoperations more transparent so that the public could makeinformed decisions. The monetary policy stance of the CentralBank was reviewed on a regular basis and the public was keptinformed of the decisions as per an advance release calendar.In addition, the Central Bank continued to release informationon developments in relation to key economic variables,includin-e the monetary tar-eets, on the CentralBank's website,to enable market participants to make better decisions.In 2004, the financial environment became moreconducive to monetary policy transmission, with the continueddevelopment of the payment and settlement systems.Improvements were made to the Real Time Gross Settlement(RTGS) system, the Scripless Securities Settlemenr (SSS)system was introduced and the Central Depository system(CDS) for government securities was established. There hasbeen a consequential improvement in the efficiency of financialtransactions and a reduction in risks and the cost oftransactions.Financial institutions and markets improved in terms ofboth soundness and increased use of technolo-ey, therebyfurther facilitatin_e the smooth transmission of monetary policy.The Central Bank took several measures to improve theresilience and the stability of the banking sector, whichincluded the computation of capital adequacy as well as Iiquidasset ratios on a consolidated basis and streamliningprovisioning procedures in respect of NPLs. A series of furtherreforms have also been planned including amendments tomajor laws applicable to the financial system and enhancingaccess to finance.7.3 Developments in Money and CreditAggregates

Reserve Money

Reserve money, which mainly consists of currency incirculation and the deposits of commercial banks with theCentral Bank, rose by Rs.29,6 billion (21 per cent) to Rs,17lbillion by end 2004,which is about Rs. 6 billion hi_eher rhan theexpected range in the monetary programme. This increase wasentirely reflected in the expansion of NDA of the Central bankas its NFA recorded a decline, reflecting the deficit in thebalance of payments. Durin-e 2004, the level of excess marketliquidity remained at about Rs. 6 billion, on average, reducing

the pressure on interest rates. To guide interest rates within thepolicy corridor, the Central Bank absorbed the excess liquidityon a daily basis through its active OMO.The decline in net foreign assets was mainly a result ofdelays in receipts of foreign programme financing to thegovernment and sales of foreign exchange by the Central Bankin the market to contain excessive volatility in the foreignexchan,ee market. As the required level of foreign exchangesales was large and spread throughout the year, the CentralBank resorted to purchasing Treasury bills in order to prevent

a potential liquidity crunch and ensure the smooth functioningof the financial system. Consequently, NDA of the CentralBank increased sharply, as the Central Bank's holdings ofTreasury bills (net of Repos) increased from Rs. I 1.5 billion atend 2003 to Rs.74 billion by end 2004. However rhe totalincrease in the NDA was Rs. 42 billion, including the increaseof Rs. 4 billion in the provisional advances to the government.rFrom the perspective of how reserve money was used bythe economy, the increase was reflected in an increase in thedeposits of commercial banks with the Central Bank and, anincrease in currency in circulation. The deposits of commercialbanks with the Central Bank grew by Rs.l2.5 billion as a resultof the hi-eher expansion in deposit liabilities of commercialbanks. On the other hand, the cunency component rose by Rs. l7billion in2004 as against an increase of Rs. I I billion in 2003.

Narrow Money (M')

Narrow money supply, which comprises currency held by thepublic and demand deposirs held by the public, expanded by16.6 per cent in 2004, in comparison to the l6 per cent growthin 2003. The increase in economic activity, the expansion inoverall liquidity and the low interest rate regime contributed toraisin-{ the holdin_es of currency as well as demand deposits.Currency held by the public increased by Rs. 14 billion (16.5per cent) and demand deposits held by the public grew byRs. l3 billion (16.8 per cenr).

1 The government is eligible to borrow up to 1 0 per cent of the estimated annualrevenue in the budget lrom the Central Bank as a provisional advance.

Broad Money (Mro)

The higher expansion in broad money (Mrn), since the latter

part of 2003, continued in the first half of 2004 before

accelerating further in the second half of 2004. Durin-e the first

half of the year, broad money growth was in the ran-te of

15 - l6 per cent, while it fluctuated in a range of around

l7- 19.6 per cent durin-u the second half of 2004' This increase

was mainly due to a high expansion of credit to both the private

sector and the public sector.Almost all the use side factors of Mrb vi:. currency,

demand deposits, and time and savings deposits, grew at a

higher rate compared to 2003. Reflectin-e the higher transaction

demand for money arising from improved economic activities

curency increased by l6 per cent. Savin-qs deposits grew by 20

per cent while time deposits grerv by 25 per cent, reflecting the

continued efforts of banks to attract savin-Es throu-sh diff'erent

deposit schemes as well as the highel levels of overall liquidity

in the economy. Attracted by higher interest rates offered by

domestic banks in Sri Lanka, foreign cuffency deposits also

increased furtherby uS dollars 316 million tn2004, following

an increase of US dollars 168 million in 2003, increasin-e the

totalforeign cunency deposit base to US dollars 1,731 million.

Factors Affecting Broad Money (Mro) Growth

Almost the entire growth in Mrn was due to an increase in NDA

of the banking system (98 per cent), in contrast to the ori-einal

projections tvhere the major contribution was expected flom an

increase in NFA of the bankin-e system. NFA of the bankin-e

system improved only marginally in 2004 contributing about

2 per cent to the,qrowth in money supply' This was wholly due

to the improvement in NFA of commercialbanks as NFA of the

Central Bank declined, reflecting a deficit of about US dollars

205 million in the BOP. However, the decline in NFA of the

Central Bank was partly otfset by the proceeds of the Sri Lanka

Development Bonds (SLDBs) as the government sold them to

the Central Bank. NFA of commercial banks improved by

about Rs.16 billion, benefiting from the increase in foreign

remittances, hi-9her earnings from tourism. forei-qn exchange

received from the SLT bond issue and the receipt of theprivatisation proceeds from Lanka Indian Oil Company

(LIOC), enabling the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) to

settle a part of it's liabilities to commercial banks.Credit to the private sector contributed largely to the

monetary expansion (81 per cent). The acceleration of credit,

from the end of 2003, continued in 2004 with an expansionof about Rs.l15 billion in 2004. Accordingly, the point to

point growth in credit to the private sector increased to 22

per cent as at end 2004 tiom 17 per cent as at end 2003'

About 84 per cent of the credit expansion came from

domestic banking units (DBUs) of commercial banks whilethe balance 16 per cent came from the foreign currencybankin,e units (FCBUs). The expansion in credit of a highermagnitude was a reflection of the continued recovery ineconomic activities, the expansion in forei-en trade and thedecline in lending rates in real terms. The decomposition ofcredit indicates that the hi,eh demand for credit in 2004 wasmainly for commercial, consumption, housing, industrial, and

services related puposes. The growth in credit granted forcommercial, housin-e and consumption activities accountedfor about 72 per cent of the credit growth with the

consumption category recordin-e the highest growth of around4l per cent. The commercial sector, which generally absorbsabout one third of the total credit and consists of export,import, wholesale and retail trade sub sectors, showed agrowth of 18.2 per cent. Meanwhile, the indushial sectorutilised about 10 per cent of the total credit expansion and

-qrew by l2 per cent. Credit granted for housing and propertydevelopment activities, which grew by 24 per cent,contributed to 14 per cent of the credit growth.During 2004, net credit to the government (NCG) from thebanking system increased by a hi-eher rate than expected due

to an increase in the bud,eet det'icit, and shortfalls in projected

foreign financing and the realisation of privatisation proceeds.Limitations in the availability of non-bank sector resources for

budgetary financin.e also caused an increase in bank credit to

the -qovernment. Accordin,ely, NCG from the banking system

increased by about Rs.44 billion in 2004. This was solely due

to the increase in NCG from the CentralBank by Rs.66 billion

as NCG from commercial banks declined by Rs.22 billion in2004. The increase in NCG tiom the Central Bank reflected

e: Central Bank of Sri Lanka

mainly the increased holdings of Treasury bills by the CentralBank, which increased by Rs.63 billion. A large part of the

expansionary effect of this increase was offset by the declinein NFA of the Central Bank.The decline in NCG from commercial banks was a netoutcome of the decline in holdings of Treasury bills andTreasury bonds and an increase in their investments in SLDBs.In 2004, the government raised SLDBs amounting to USdollars 158.5 million, on a net basis, as the government issuedSLDBs worth US dollars 250 million while SLDBs worth USdollars 91.5 million matured in2004. Commercial banks were

the main investors in SLDBs, subscribing to about 85 per centof the issues.An increase in credit to public corporations by Rs. 5billion in 2004, in contrast to the repayments expected at the

beginning of the year, was another contributory factor for thegrowth in money supply. This increase in credit was a result ofbonowings by the CPC of about Rs.8 billion, while the othertwo major corporations, i.e., CEB and CWE, settled a part oftheir liabilities, amounting to Rs.3 billion during the year, The

increase in credit to the CPC was a result of delays in adjusting

domestic fuel prices in line with internationalprices, requiringadditional borrowings from the banking system. Althou-ehliabilities of the CEB to commercial banks declined, the CEB

has increased its liabilities to other parties such as the CPC andprivate power producers.During 2004, the money multiplier declined onlymarginally from 5.08 as at end 2003 to 5.02 as at end 2004.However, the declining trend in the currency to deposit ratiofurther continued in 2004, which is attributed to the

improvement in bankin-e facilities and greater use of electronicpayment methods.

Financial Survey

The financial survey, which includes the activities of licensedspecialized banks and finance companies in addition to theCentral Bank and licensed commercial banks, provides abroader measure of liquidity. However, some of the assets

included in the financial survey are lesr; iiquid than the assetsincluded in Mro. Therefore, Mrn is considered to be a better

measure as an intermediate target in the conduct of monetarypolicy than the measure of liquidity provided by the financial

survey.The overall liquidity measured by the financial survey

recorded a lower growth than the -qrowth of Mro. On a point-

to-point basis, this growth was in a range of 15.3 - 17.9 per centin comparison to the growth of l5-19.6 per cent in Mro. Thiswas mainly due to the slower growth of investment in

government paper by licensed specialised banks (LSBs).In 2004, credit to the private sector in the financial survey

increased by a higher magnitude in comparison to 2003. On apoint-to-point basis, credit to the private sector based on thefinancial survey increased by 21.8 per cent compared with the

16.9 per cent growth recorded in 2003. In the total creditexpansion of around Rs.l45 billion, the contribution from

LSBs, finance companies and RDBs was atound Rs.30 billion.Of this, a larger contribution amounting to Rs.l9 billion came

from LSBs while the contribution from finance companies was

Rs.8 billion. In comparison, the growth in credit extended by

these institutions in 2003 was Rs.2l billion. A major share of

the growth in loans granted by LSBs has been for agriculture,manufacturing and trading, while most of the lending by

finance companies has been for leasing purposes.

7.4 Interest Rates

The declining trend in interest rates that prevailed throughout2003 reversed with a marginal increase in 2004 with risinginflation, inflation expectations, increasing credit demand and

the monetary policy measures taken. In2004, real interest ratesin many market segments became negative as inflation

Source: Central Bank of Sri Lanka

increased at a faster rate than the increase in interest rates. Asmany central banks around the world commenced tighteningthe monetary policy stance in their respective countries,international market rates also indicated a gradual upward

movement.

Central Bank Policy Rates

The Repo and Reverse Repo rates, which were reduced

continuously since February 2001, were left unchan-eed duringthe first ten months of the year until they were increased

towards the end of the year. An increase in policy interest rates

was necessitated in order to contain the higher than anticipated

increase in credit and monetary aggregates as well as to address

rising inflation and inflation expectations. Therefore, first, theyield rates at the Central Bank's OMO Repo auction were

allowed to adjust upward by absorbing a large part of the excessliquidity from the market. Subsequently, the Repo and ReverseRepo rates, which were 7.00 per cent and 8.50 per cent,

respectively, by end 2003, were increased to 7.50 per cent and9.00 per cent, respectively, with effect from the close of

business on 10 November 2004.

The Bank Rate, the rate at which the Central Bank grants

advances to commercial banks to meet their temporary liquidity

requirements, was left unchanged at 15.00 per cent during the

year.

Money Market Rates

During the first five months of 2004, the average weightedyield rate at the daily Repo auctions remained close to the

Central Bank's Repo rate. However, as the Central Bank started

to absorb the entire amount of excess liquidity from the market,

the Repo auction rate shifted upwards from the Repo rate and

moved to the centre of the interest rate corridor. Accordingly,

the weighted average OMO rate, which was 7.04 per cent on3l December 2003, had increased to its highest level of 7.93per cent by 29 November 2004. Market participants also

continued to access the Repo standing facility, while there were

some Reverse Repo transactions, reflecting structural rigiditiesin the financial system.Unlike in the year 2003, call market rates becamerelatively more volatile in 2004, occasionally rising above theupper bound of the Central Bank policy corridor, despite

maintaining overall liquidity adequately, Market uncertainty in

the immediate aftermath of the general elections, concentrationof surplus liquidity in some institutions that did not participatein the call money market, the tax structure affecting the callmarket rate and the existence of lending limits amonginstitutions, were the causes of this behaviour in call market

rates. The rates, which hovered in the range of 6.80 - 8.25 percent during the first four months, increased with larger

fluctuations thereafter. Commensurate with the increase in the

Central Bank policy rates in November, call money market rates

increased further, especially during the last week of the year.

Table 7.5

Money Market Interest Rates (a)

The Sri Lanka Inter Bank Offered Rate (SLIBOR), whichis computed based on the rates offered for rupee inter banktransactions by l2 commercial banks, showed movementssimilar to the call market rates.

Lending and Deposit Rates

Both lendin-9 and deposit rates of commercial banks increasedduring the year. The weighted average prime lending rate(AWPR), declined from9.26 per cent as at end 2003, to its

lowest level of 8.89 per cent in January, but increased to 10.23per cent by end 2004. Lending rates pertaining to overdrafts aswell as export financing facilities and import financingfacili ties increased faster.Interest rates on savings deposits continued to decline in

the first half of the year but the rates on fixed deposits increasedmarginally with the increase in yield rates on government

securities that was observed during the first seven months of

the year. The average weighted deposit rate (AWDR), whichis a weighted average of the rates on all outstanding interest

bearing deposits of commercialbanks, declined from 5.27 per

cent in December 2003, to 4.84 per cent by June 20M, but had

increased to 5.31 per cent by December 2004. The averageweighted fixed deposit rate (AWFDR), increased graduallyfrom 7.1I per cent in December 2003 to 7 .67 per cent inDecember 2004. Meanwhile, the difference between theAWDR and the AWPR, which is an indicator of the interest

spread, widened further in 2004.

The Legal Rate and the Market Rate, which are computed

based on the AWDR and published in the Government Gazetteby the Central Bank at the end of each year, also declined.Accordingly, the Legal Rate and the Market Rate applicable for

the year 2005 are 5.16 per cent compared with 6,30 per centin2004, and 9.58 per cent in2003.2

The savings deposit rate of the National Savings Bank(NSB) remained unchanged at 5.00 per cent throughout theyear, althou-qh its one-year fixed deposit rate, which was 7,00

per cent in December 2003, increased to 8.00 per cent by end2004. Considering the effect of low deposit rates on seniorcitizens and retirees, the NSB as well as the two state bankscontinued special deposit schemes with high interest rates,targeting them, while private commercialbanks also introducedsimilar schemes.

Interest rates charged by commercial banks on outstandin_e

payments through credit cards, which were in a range of 2I-35

per cent at end 2003, remained broadly unchanged at end 2004.However, it should be noted that this is only a penal rate on

those who do not settle their balances even after the interest

free period provided to credit card holders and does not reflect

the normal price of credit.With respect to lon-e-term credit institutions, lending

rates of DFCC Bank and the State Mortga-ee and InvestmentBank (SMIB) remained unchanged during the year, althoughlending rates of the National Development Bank (NDB)

showed an increase. Accordingly, the lending rates of DFCC

Bank remained in a range of 9.25-16.00 per cent at end 20M,while the lending rates of the SMIB were 12.00-13.25 per

cent by end 2004. Lending rates of the NDB had increasedfrom 7.75-15.20 per cent to 9.60-16.00 per cent during the

year.As intemational market rates starled to increase towardsthe end of the year, commercial banks in Sri Lanka alsoincreased their interest rates on foreign currency deposits

and on foreign currency lending. At end 2004, interest rates

on US dollar denominated savings accounts were in the rangeof 0.20 to 2.25 per cent, while on sterling pound

denominated savings accounts they were 1.00 to 4.50 percent. The interest rates applicable to lending in US dollars

were in the range of LIBOR+0.75 per cent to 11.50 per cent,while on lending in sterling pounds, rates charged were

between LIBOR+3.75 per cent and 11.50 per cent.

Yields on Government Securities

lnterest rates at the weekly Treasury bill auctions increasedduring the first seven months of the year, but declinedthereafter. The decline in the yields on 9l-day, 182-day and364-day Treasury bills occurred with the shifting ofgovernment borrowings to forei-en currency sources, with the

issue of SLDBs, and as institutional investors increased theiractive role in the primary Treasury bill market.In contrast to 2003, where longer-term Treasurybonds were issued continuously, Treasury bondissues in 2004 had shorter maturities. At the firstprimary auction for two-year Treasury bonds held in January2004, the yield was 7.64 per cent, but it increased to9.68 per cent by end July. However, the yield on

two-year Treasury bonds had declined to 8.25 per cent by endDecember. Primary market yield rates on three^year Treasury

bonds were around 8.40 - 8.88 per cent durin-e the year, while

there were a few four-year Treasury bond auctions as well.The secondary market yields on governmentsecurities increased at the longer end, indicating higherinflation expectations in the medium term. In comparison to

end 2003, the secondary market yield rates on Treasury billsincreased by around 15-60 basis points, while yield rates onTreasury bonds had increased by 14-290 basis points at

end 2004.Rupee loans with call options, which carried highyield rates, were recalled as a cost reduction strategy of the government, while a small amount of Rupeeloans with maturity periods ranging from 2-6 yearswere issued durin-e 2004. Interest rate on Rupee loans,which are administratively determined, was 8.00per cent during the year. The dollar denominated

SLDB issue amounting to US dollars 250 million was made in

three tranches, with the weighted average yield of the entire

issue bein-e six months LIBOR+179.3 basis points.

Yields on Corporate Debt Securities

Interest rates pertaining to commercial paper, a short-term debt

instrument, which were in the range of 7,25-13.00 per cent in

2003, had increased to a range of 9.50-13.75 per cent by end

7.5 lssues in Conducting Monetary Policy

The conduct of monetary policy has improved over the years

with greater market orientation and increased transparency, andfurther improvements are under consideration. The present

monetary management strategy has been based on a monetarytargeting framework, where the Central Bank uses its policy

instruments to regulate the money supply. Under the monetarytargeting framework, inflation is only an implicit target,

whereas targeting inllation explicitly has several advantages,It helps anchor inflation expectations, through which it couldalso help reduce the size of inf'lationary shocks and theirassociated costs while strengthening business and public

confidence in monetary policy.

Under the present monetary targetin-g framework, chan-qesin policy interest rates are expected to impact on price levels,through various channels of monetary policy transmission.3

3 Monetary policy transmission primarily works through five channels, v2.,interest rate channel, exchange rate channel, wealth channel, credit channel andexpectations.

Monetary policy transmission involves variable and lon-e la-{s,and therefore monetary policy action may not show the

expected impact on prices immediately. In Sri Lanka, it has

been noticed that the interest rate pass throu-eh, the major policy

transmission channel, has been slu-egish and asymmetric due to

structural ri-eidities in the hnancial markets. Further deepenin-eof the financial system and increasing inte-eration of financial

markets would accelerate the monetary policy transmission

process and raise the policy impact.

Therefore, in the medium term, moving to an inflation-

tar-{etin-e framework would increase the effectiveness ofmonetary policy aimed at price stability. However, severalprerequisites need to be fulfilled before implementing a

successful inflation-targeting framelork.{ [n this re-eard,

emphasis has to be given to (l) improving fiscal consolidation,(2) stren-tthening the monetary policy transmission process,(3) developing a widely accepted measure of inflation and(4) improving the technical abilities for modelling and

forecastin-e.

4 Debelle, G , et al, (1998), 'lnflation Targeting as a Framework for MonetaryPolicy", lMF. cite four prerequisites for inllation targeting, viz , (11Central bankindependence, i.e., no fiscal dominance, (2) willingness and ability of monelaryauthorities not to target other indicators, (3) establishing explicit quantitative

targets, and (4) devise a forward looking operating procedure in which monetarypolicy instruments are adjusted in line with assessmenls of fulure inflation.
