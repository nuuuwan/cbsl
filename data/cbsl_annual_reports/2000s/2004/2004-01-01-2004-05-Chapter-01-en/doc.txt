ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

1.1 Overviews Sri Lanka's economy registered an annual growth of 5.4per cent in the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)in 2004. The growth of over 5 per cent is a reflection of

the economy's resilience to the many adverse shocks

the country had to face during the year - the surge ininternational oil prices, a severe drought in the early

part and the floods later on in the year and finally, the tsunami

disaster. The growth was largely supported by the strong

growth in exports, consumption and investment as well as the

continuation of the ceasefire. However, the growth rate was

much below the 6-8 per cent growth rate required for a

sustainable reduction in unemployment and poverty in Sri

Lanka. It is also noteworthy that the country's per capita

GDP exceeded US dollars 1,000 for the first time. With this

achievement, it is expected that Sri Lanka would makefurther progress in becoming an upper middle income

country facing a new set of challen,qes.o Investment improved while savings remained stable in

2004. The investment/GDP ratio improved to 25 per cent

fromZZ.l per cent in 2003, entirely due to increased private

investment. The domestic savings/GDP ratio was 15.9 per

cent in 2004, the same level as in 2003. National savings,

which include net factor income and net private cunent

transfers from abroad, also remained unchan-eed at2l6per

cent of GDP. This led to a widening of the savings-

investment gap, as also reflected by the widened current

account deficit in the balance of payments (BOP), which was

financed tluough increased utilisation of foreign savings and

official reserves. As these levels of savings and investment

are not adequate to raise growth and the standards of living

substantially, a concerted effort must be made to raise

savings and investment at least up to 30 per cent of GDP in

the near future. Increased investment needs to be channelled

to improve essential infrastructure, which would be'mostproductive in promoting a higher and regionally

balanced growth,

Healthy developments in the Services and Industry

sectors contributed to economic growth in 2004 while theAgriculture sector faced a setback due to adverse weather

conditions. The Services sector grew by 7 .6per cent in 2004

as reflected by the growth of wholesale and retail trade,

hotels and restaurants, transport and communication, and

financial, real estate and business services subsectors, and

contributed 77 per cent to the overall growth. Stron-q extemal

and domestic demand helped the Industry sector to grow by

5.2per cent, contributing 25.7 per cent to the overall growth.

The Agriculture sector faced a negative growth of 0.7

per cent in2D4.

Sustainable growth in agriculture requires increasedcontributions from both plantation and non-plantation

sectors. The plantation sector needs further increases in

productivity and crop diversification. In the non-plantation

small-holder sector, access to finance and land utilisation

need to be improved, guidance through extension services

should be provided, and improved new crop varieties andproductivity enhancin-e methods should be introduced. In

both sectors, the key to raising agricultural productivity lies

in the introduction of high yieldin-e varieties, the usage of

new technolo-ey such as drip inigation and poly tunnels, the

adoption of research and technological developments, the use

of advanced crop practices throu-eh intemational partnerships

and the more efficient use of inputs.

Development of the irrigation infrastructure should beaccelerated to further support the Agriculture sector.

Recent resurgence in developing and rehabilitatin-e tanks and

waterways mana-qement has a beneficial impact on the sector.

Continued development will help the sector overcome any

adverse impact of drou-eht cycles.

Post harvest losses in agriculture, especially in perishable

crops, continue to remain high. Such losses, estimated tct

be around 30-35 per cent of production, result in lower

incomes for producers and higher prices for consumers.Action, therefore, needs to be taken to reduce losses throughproper packaging, improved transportation facilities and

other means.

International oil prices increased sharply in 2004 raisingSri Lanka's average import price of crude oil to US

dollars 37 per banel tiom US dollars 29 per banel in 2003,

resulting an increase in the oilbillby US dollars 372 million.

This contributed to the u'orsening of the BOP and the f.iscal

situation with a substantial increase in subsidy payments tooil distributors, and the continuation of inefficient use of fuel

since domestic prices hal,e not been f ully adjusted to reflect

increases in international prices. The increased expenditure

could have been utilised fbr raisin-e the level of investment

substantially, for instance, to cover the entire cost of a lar-ee

investment project such as the Southem Expressway.

Inflation, which was mostly benign throughout 2003

began to rise in 2004 with the drought and the higher fuelprices leading to high cost-push inflation, while theincrease in money supply and flrscal expansion, causeddemand-pull inflation. The annual average inflation rate

based on the Colombo Consumers' Price Index (CCPI) rose

Chart 1.3

Exports and lmporls

to7.6 per cent tn2004, compared with 6.3 per cent in 2003.

The Sri Lanka Consumers' Price Index (SLCPI) also shorved

a7 .9 per cent increase in 2004.

Both trade and current accounts in the BOP recordeddeficits. A hi-eh import grorvth of 20 per cent, lar,eely dueto hi-eh intemational fuel prices, surpassed the I2 per centgrowth in exports and the I I per cent increase in workerremittances. The surpluses in the capital and financialaccounts were not adequate to cover the cunent accountdeficit due to lower than expected programme loans from

the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

Hence, the overall BOP resulted in a deficit of US dollars205 million and the effective exchange rate (based on the24 cunency basket) depreciated by ll and l.l per cent,in nominal and real ferms, respectively.

The conduct of fiscal policy in 2004 was a challenge inthe face of internal and external shocks that werethreatening to slowdorvn the economy. Thegovernmentts overall fiscal deflrcit increased to 8,2 percent of GDP compared with 8.0 per cent in 2003. Theconcomitant public sector deficit, which is the total of thegovernment deficit and the operational losses of publicsector corporations, was 8.4 per cent of GDP in 2004,compared u'ith 7.8 per cent in 2003, mainly due to theoperational losses of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation(CPC) and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). In thiscontext, the government revised fuel prices uprvards in2004. Nevertheless, the revisions were not adequate andthe spillover eft'ects of increases in international pricescontinued to be a heavy burden on the public sector. The

increased public sector defrcit in2004 was financed largelythrough borrowings from domestic sources due to ashortfall in fbreign financing. However, government andpublic sector debt as percentages of GDP decreasedmarginally to 105.5 per cent and 107,5 per cent,respectively, in 2004 from 105.8 per cent and 107.9 percent, respectively, in 2003, due to a higher increase innominal GDP comoared to the increase in debt stocksin 2004.

The fiscal consolidation process continued in 20M withthe government introducing a series of measures toimprove the revenue performance and to rationalize

expenditure. These included the strengthening of the tax

administration, introduction of the Economic Service Charge

(ESC), the revision of administered prices, the rationalisationof recurrent expenditure, the strengthening of publicenterprises by setting up the Strategic Enterprises

Management Agency (SEMA), and the establishment of the

Administrative Reforms Committee (ARC) and the National

Counci I for Admini stration (l{CA). In addition, transparency

in govemment procurement was strengthened by adhering to

the reporting requirements of the Fiscal Management(Responsibility) Act (FMRA) and the setting up of the

National Procurement Agency (NPA).

Monetary policy was aimed at containing inflationary

pressures while supporting economic growth. The rate ofgrowth in monetary aggregates rose to a level above the

desired path, particularly after mid 2004, driven mainly by

the higher expansion in credit to both the private and public

sectors. Reserve money rose by 2l per cent during 2004,

adverse BOP outcome. In tesponse, the Central Bank

tightened the monetary policy stance by implementing open

and raising its policy rates in November 2004.

Box 1The Tsunami Disaster

On26 December 2Q04, an undersea earthquake registerin_e9.0 on the Richter scale, later upgraded to 9.3, struck in theIndian Ocean, off the Western coast of Northern Sumatra,lndonesia. at 6.59 a.m. Sri Lanka time. This has been themost powerful ea:thquake experienced since the earthquakethat struck Alaska in 1964, which measured 9.2 on theRichter scale. The seismic movement triggered a series oftsunamis that caused the worst natural disaster in the modernhistory. Waves of up to l5 m (about 50 feet) in heighttravelling at a speed of more than 500 km per hour causeddevastation along the coastlines of Bangladesh, India,Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, the Maldives, Mauritius,Seychel[es, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, and Thailand.Due to the distances involved, the tsunami took differenttime intervals ranging from tifteen minutes to seven hoursto reach the coastlines of the various countries. The tsunamisreached the worst affected areas of Indonesia withinminutes. Sri Lanka and the East coast of India were affectedafter about two hours. The death toll due to the tsunamis inall the af-fected countries is over 270,000. '

SriLanka was severely affected by the tsunamis. They

caused extensive damage along more than two thirds or over1,000 km of the coasiline eitending from the Northerncoast, through the Eastern and Southern coasts to thewestern coast. The first wave hit Kalmunai on the East coastof the country at 8.27 a.m. on 26 December. Thereafter,different parts of Sri Lanka were struck by the tsunamisbetween 8.27 a.m. and 10.30 a.m. About 31.000 human liveshave been lost, over 4,000 persons are reported missing andnearly 550,000 were left homeless.r Coastal infrastructureand public and private property in the affected areas wereseverely damaged while economic activities, mainly fishin-e,tourism, trading and small-scale industries, have been

disrupted. The total damage is estimated to be around USdollars I billion (4.9 per cent of the GDP) and thereconstruction, which is likely to spread over a period ofabout three years, is estimated to cost around US dollars1.8 billion (8.9 per cent of the GDP). Economic growth in2005 has been revised dorvnwards by about 0.5 - 1.0 percent from the original estimate of 6.0 per cent. mainly dueto disruptions to the fisheries and tourism sectors. Hower,'er,the negative impact of these trvo sectors will largely beoffset by the extensive reconstruction and rehabilitationactivities planned for 2005. :

As Sri Lanka lies in the large Indo-Australian plate faraway from any of the plate boundaries, many believed thatSri Lanka was safe from risks associated with earth tremors.However, recent evidence indicates a possible splitting ofthe Indo-Australian plate just about 300 km from theSouthwest coast of Sri Lanka, creating a new plate.Therefore, the vulnerability of Sri I anka to earth tremors ishigher now than before. This should be a serious concern inall aspects of planning in Sri Lanka.Coping with nafural disa-sters of this magnitude has tobe done with extensive support from the public, private andnon-governmental sectors as well as the internationalcommunity. International support is needed especially ininformation sharing, technological developments, economicpartnership as well as by way of assistance for rehabilitationand reconstruction. It is also vital to develop acomprehensive plan for disaster prevention. risk mitigationand disaster management with the support of allstakeholders in the counlry.

governments over the past two and a half decades.6 While the country was preparing itself to face the

challenges of growing macroeconomic imbalances, theyear ended rvith an unexpected and unprecedented

devastation caused by the tsunamis released by a massive

undersea earthquake that occuned on December 26,2004.This national tragedy caused a loss of over 30,000 lives,

displaced over half a million people, brought about immense

human suffenng and destroyed a massive volume of physical

property alon-e more than two-thirds of SriLanka's coastline.Although the immediate macroeconomic impact of thetsunamis was limited to a few sectors, it significantlychanged the macroeconomic outlook and posed new

challenges in economic management in view of the lar-ee

resource requirement for rebuilding the affected areas and

providin-e relief to affected people on a sustainable basiswithin the shortest possible time. In this regard, the country

was fortunate to receive pledges of assistance for relief,

rehabilitation and reconstruction (RRR).

The MTMF presented with the Budget 2005, has beenrevised by taking into account the impact of RRR

associated with the tsunami disaster. The economic growth

would suffer in 2005 albeit marginally, mainly due to the

impact on the fisheries and tourism sectors. Increased

rebuildin-e activities would compensate to some extent for the

loss of economic activities in fisheries and tourism. The

growth is expected to accelerate to over 6 per cent tiom 2006

onwards, spreading across all sectors and geographic regions

with the renewed emphasis on regional development as well

as the nation rebuilding programme by the government.

Several downside risks remain in achieving the

immediate as well as the medium term targets. First, therisk of further escalation of international oil prices still

remain. Any further increase in oil prices could exert a heavy

burden on the economy and the people. Second, the global

economy has already shown si-ens of a slowin,e down in

2005. This may threaten Sri Lanka's export performance.Third, Sri Lanka's major export industry, textiles and

garments, is faced with increased competition in the world

market due to the phasing out of the Multi Fibre Arrangement(MFA) in 2005. Fourth, any delay in the disbursement ofpledged foreign assistance may delay the urgent

rehabilitation and reconstruction work, affecting overall

economic performance in the medium term. Thus, the

country needs to be prepared to face any of these adversities.

It is imperative to continue consolidating the progress

made in achieving greater macroeconomic stability while

taking actions to remove structural weaknesses inhibitinggrowth. In this connection, curbing monetary expansion and

completing the fiscal consolidation process are essential to

improve the country's macroeconomic stability. Productive

use of government expenditure and repositioning of the

,qovemment sector delivery mechanism to reach all sectorsof the economy need to be ensured by the phasing out of

wasteful subsidies, which have hindered productive public

investment. Fiscal revenue needs to be increased to generate

fiscal surpluses thereby providing flexibility to both t'iscal

and monetary policies in combating sectoralimbalances and

promoting both stability and -{rowth. The efficient utilizationof foreign assistance for reconstruction and rehabilitation

without disturbing the macroeconomic siability and on going

development processes in the other parts of the countryrequires a significant improvement in the absorption

capacity. It is also important to ensure that domestic

economic imbalances arising from large inflows of forei-enaid are appropriately addressed while taking steps to

accelerate the rate of utilisation of foreign aid.

On the structural front, reforms are needed to improve

institutions, markets and infrastructure. The operational

efficiency in the public enterprises needs to be improved,

especially with respect to developing appropriate pricing

mechanisms, enhancing competition and strengthening the

organisational set up. A renewed emphasis has to be placedon overcoming the energy crisis in the country by

restructuring the energy sector and shiffing to altemative low

cost sources. Sri Lanka's external competitiveness dependscrucially on the availability of low cost energy, comparablewith its competitor countries. Other reforms include

increasing the efficiency in factor markets, enhancing accessto finance by the rural sector and small and medium scale

enterprises (SMEs), providing essential public goo&, placingadequate public investment, enhancing civil

service efficiency, improving physical and institutional

infrastructure facilities, developing incentive schemes forthe economic agents to become successful with theirown resources without government handouts, developing

human capital, and promoting new technology, as well as

supporting research and development.

With respect to labour market reforms, it is important

that both employers and employees recognise the beneflrtsof productivity based remuneration schemes and the

importance of maintaining market flexibility to ensurecompetitiveness of domestic production. It is equallyimportant to upgrade the skills of the labour force by

appropriately improving secondary and tertiary education

enabling SriLanka's labour force to cater to the demands of

a dynamic and competitive economy.

Sri Lanka has made steady progress in frnancial sectorreforms in improving efficiency in the banking sector.

Nevertheless, the interest spread of banks in Sri Lanka

remained one of the highest in the region due to high staff

costs of 1.9 per cent of average assets of the banking sector.

Comparable staff costs in both India and Pakistan are 1.3 per

cent of average assets, Thus, banks in Sri Lanka need to payspecial attention to narrowing this gap through

improved productivi ty.

Sri Lanka's potential in achieving a growth of 6-8 per cent

lies in several areas. The Services sector offers the greatest

opportunities, given Sri Lanka's highly literate work force,

Sri Lankans' eagerness to learn, and its strategic location

close to major sea routes and intemational telecommunication

lines. Financialservices, the leisure sector, port services, andinfbrmation and telecommunication display ample space to

Box 2A Regional Comparison of the Interest Spread and the Interest Marginin the Commercial Banking Sector

The interest spread and the interest margin reflect theefficiency of financial intermediaries in an economy. Theinterest spread is deflned as the difference between theaverage yield of interest earning assets and the averagecost of interest bearing Iiabilities'. The interest margin isdefined as the ratio of net interest income to banks'average assets2.Several factors determine the interest spread and theinterest margin. First, non-performing loans (NPLs)

reduce the effective interest income of banks since bankshave to make provisions out of interest income to coverlosses due to NPLs. Second, banks have to coveradministration and other operational costs. Third, in somecountries, banks are required to maintain statutoryreserves (i.e. statutory reserue requirement - SRR), as apart of monetary policy action with no remunerationthereon. Fourth, banks maintain cash balances to meetdeposit withdrawals, which also do not earn anyinterest income. Fifth, structural Iimitations hindercompetitiveness in the financial sector. Finally,macroeconomic factors such as le-qal and other proceduralbottlenecks, and uncertainty in relation to themacroeconomic environment could add an extra premiumto the cost of intermediation.Tables I and 2 summarise the interest spread and theinterest margin in Sri Lanka and neighbouring countries.The interest spread allows to identify the effects of NPLs,cash at hand of commercial banks and SRR, while theinterest margin, allows to identity the effect of operational

costs of banks.

'Based on data for 2003

Both the interest spread and the interest margin shou'that the intermediation cost is higher in Sri Lanka than inneighbouring South Asian countries, mostly due to highoperational costs in the domestic banking system. Highinterest margins in a bankin_q system are indicative of dceprooted symptoms of incfficiency, absence of competition,non-diversification of income sources, skewed developmentof money and capital markets in favour of bank lending andintlexibility of rate adjustments symmetrically in responseto market rate changes. Hence, to create public awarenessof the issue and promote competition, the Central Bankcommenced publishing Iending and deposit rfltes of banksas well as fees and commissions charged by banks. Inaddition, banks were asked to display lending rates anddeposit rates at their places of businesses so that the publiccould negotiate the best terms with banks.The resolution of NPLs is aft'e cted by lengthy andcumbersome Ie-ual procedures; which also involve high

costs. In this regard, the enactment of the necessary legalreforms and the implementation of a more effectiveinstitutional framework, perhaps with the setting up of asset

management companies as done in several countries, would

be usetul. Promoting and developing the bond market is alsoimportant in bringing down the intermediation cost, as the

bond market would exert pressure on banks to reduce theirlending rates. Further, it is important that lending rates be

based on the viability of the projects and proper assessmentsof the collateral offered, rvhich rvill help reduce the

intermediation cost.

Brow. It is also necessary to re-emphasise that the Agriculture

and Manufacturin-e sectors should raise their contribution tothe economy. Growth in all these sectors needs to be

promoted with enhanced pr oducti vity, technolo-ey adaptation

and further dere-eulation, thereby devel<lping a productivity

conscious culture in Sri Lanka. To promote public-private

partnership in policy formulation and inrplementation and to

coordinate the government's efforts in developing _erowthinitiatives needed for economic development, the government

set up the National Council for Economic Development(NCED) in2004.2

With respect to the post tsunami disaster recovery efforts,it is encouraging to note that the government is engagedin developing disaster management policies and

strategies, and a national rebuilding programme through

its operational arms of Task Force for Rebuilding the Nation(TAFREN) and Task Force for Relief (TAFOR). The

government is also actively engaged in consolidating the

peace process, maintaining law and order, and improvinggovernance. International organisations have already

applauded Sri Lanka for its good governance and low levelsof red tape and corruption compared to other countries

in the region.3

To further consolidate its achievements and propel the

economy on to a higher growth path, the govcrnment has

to increase the provision of public goods and services inthe most efficient and equitable manner, while makingroom and providing a conducive environment for theprivate sector to unleash its creative energy. Since this

process has already begun, the private sector too needs to

take its olvn initiatives to support the growth process by

takin-q steps to expand the production frontier through

increasin-{ productivity, continuously en,eaging in research

and development, and facin-e challen-ees of -slobalisationwhile reaping benefits from it. Such a dynamic private sectorwill drive the economy forrvard, creating employment,reducin-e poverty and promoting corporate socialresponsibility for sustained economic developmentof the countrv.

creation, livin-e conditions, employment generation, and itsability to move along a sustainable long-term growth path.

Hence, Sri l,anka is not insulated from economic prosperities

and depressions in the rest of the world,& The global economy in 2004 was markd by a u'idespreadgrowth of 5.1 per cent, the fastest global economic gro\ythrecorded in the past few decades, despite the daunting

surge in international oil prices. The main contributor to

-elobal recovery was the United States of America (USA),which grew at an estimated high growth of 4.4 per cent in

2004 due to the robust personal consumption expenditure andthe continued positive investment expenditure. Japan'seconomy too recorded a strong performance in 2004following several years of economic stagnation. In contrast,

the Euro area grew at a lacklustre pace owing to subdueddomestic demand and the appreciation of its currency, the

euro, stunting the external demand. The oilprice shock thathit the global economy in 2004 was very hi_sh in nominal

terms, but not so severe in real terms, when compared with

the severity of the oil price shock of the 1970s.

-{rowin-q at 9.5 per cent and 7.3 per cent, respectively, in

2W4. The transition economies of Europe, including Russia,

Ukraine and new members of the European Union (EU) haveimproved their economic performance in 2004. Several

countries in Africa and the Middle East have benefited from

hi-eher oil and commodity prices.

Accompanied by higher global economic grorvth, worldtrade grew by 9.9 per cent in 2004, recording the highest

rate of growth since 2000 and expinding opportunities forefficient and dynamic export oriented countries.

Dispelling the fear of continuing deflation, the historicallylow levels of global inflation that prevailed in 2003bottomed out in 2004, stimulated mainly by fiscal and

monetary policies, the rising global demand and the surgin-uoil prices. But, the policy overreaction has generated high

inflationary expectations in most industnal countries, thereby

bringing the earlier policy stimulus to an end, with resultant

-sradual increases in international interest rates,

The international financial market developments have

been orderly and market adjustments have not posed athreat to financial system stability or the health of financialinstitutions. However, on a negative note, the net capitalinflows to emer_gin-e market economies have been estimated

to decrease in20M, worsenin-u their BOP position,

The US dollar continued to depreciate against mostmajor currencies during 2004, albeit at a sloler pace than

the two previous years. The continuation of a large deficit inthe US current account caused the weakening of the USdollar. However, the impact of this imbalance on the

depreciation of the US dollar rvas partly oft'set by the rising

US interest rates, which led the Asian economies with BOP

surpluses to invest a large part of their official reserve

accumulation in US govemment secudties.

Currencies of most emerging market economies withflexible exchange rates appreciated against the US dollar,

while China, Malaysia and Hon_q Kong maintained the flxedparity a-{ainst the US dollar'. This indicated the need forexerting international pressure for _ereater flexibility in

exchange rate mana-qement in the re,eion, particularly on thecountries that have been follorving fixed exchange ratere-eimes. Similarly, a closer macroeconomic policycoordination amon.q the major industrial countries isnecessary, as sharp fluctuations in the cross rates among

major cunencies create difficulties in the macroeconomic

management of developing countries.* The prospects for global economic growth in 2005 appear

to be still favourable, althou_qh the globaleconomic -qrowthhas been projected to be lower at around 4.3 per cent. The

growth in the volume of world trade is projected to decline

to 7 .4 per cent in 2005 from 9.9 per cent in 20M reflecting

the slower global economic growth. The terms of trade is

expected to worsen for oil importin_u countries as oil prices

have been projected to increase at a faster rate than other

commodity prices. The continuation of significantly lar-{etwin deficits in the USA, fiscal deficit (estimated at 4.4 per

cent of GDP in 2005) and external current account deficit(estimated at 5.8 per cent of GDP in 2005), has posed

downside risks to the expected high growth in the USA andthe global economy. The impact on Sri Lanka of anyslowdown in the US economy would largely come through

a lowering of exports, as the USA is Sri Lanka's largest

export market.

1.3 Macroeconomic Performance andPolicies in 2004

Economic Growth, National Income andIncome Distributionln 2004, GDP in real terms grerv by 5.4 per centdemonstrating resilience in a challengingenvironment, marked by geo-political imbalances,adverse oil price shocks, drought, and politicaluncertainty. Althou-eh this growth is lorver than the growthof6.0 per cent recorded in 2003, it has exceeded the annualgrowth trend of around 5 per cent maintained during the past

few years. The deceleration in growth in20M was mainly the

outcome of the poor performance in agriculture, due to theadverse weather conditions that affected plantation

agriculture in certain areas as well as paddy production in

both Maha and Yala cultivation seasons, and the reduction

in hydropower generation. The rise in international prices ofintermediate and investment _{oods, particularly ofpetroleum, has also had a negative impact on the cost ofproduction in all three sectors, agriculture, industry

and services.

GDP at current market prices rvas estimated at Rs.2,029billion in 2004, recording an increase of 15.2 per cent.This is the outcome of a 5.4 per cent real economic growth

and increase in the price level (GDP deflator) of 9.2per cent.The GDP per capita at current market prices for 2004

increased by 14.l per cent to Rs. 104.347 in 2004.In USdollar terms. pel capita GDP increased by 8. 8 per cent, from

US dol lars 948 to I ,03 I , surpassing US dollars 1,000 for thefirst time.

Gross Domestic Product (GDP)Net Factor Income from Abroad

Gross National Product (GNP)

(a) Revised(b) Provisional

The Gross National Product (GNP), defined as GDP

adjusted for net factor income from abroad (NFIA), grew

by 5.2 per cent in real terms, compared to a grorvth of 6.6per cent in 2003. The NFIA remained negative as in the

previous years, but decreased furtherby l9 per cent in2004,

compared to improvements shown in the past f'ew years. This

was mainly due to higher outflows on account of foreign debt

service payments and repatriation of protits and dividends by

forei-eners in20A4.

During the last five decades, Sri Lanka's economy gre\y

by an annual average rate of 4.2 per cent and it could not

elevate the country to a high grorvth path due to deep-rooted deficiencies in growth promoting factors. The

development of economic infrastructure needed for fastergrowth has to be accelerated through continued policy,

market, institutional and infiastructure refbrms. Amidstagitation from some sectors of the public, social

inflastructure reforms that could create a sufficiently hi-qh

level of human capital are also bein-{ implemented, rvhile

raising public awareness on their benefits. Technology and

research and development are thinly spread across several

sectors. Many -qovernment or-uanisations sutfer from chronic

inefficiency problems, in addition to displaying anti-.erowth

symptoms such as adverse selection and moral hazard. In

those organisations, ample room exists in turther enhancin_e

-qovernance and accountability. The markets that are needed

tbr ensurin-9 a better allocation of resources remain thin inmany areas of economic activities, especially in the

financial sector.

The regional distribution of GDP shows that the Western

Province has contributed 49 per cent of GDP in 2003. This

larger share is understandable, since economic activities arenormally concentrated around better social and economicinfrastructure, and the Western Province offers suchfacilities. Sri Lanka does not have any internal trade and

investment barriers, and therefore, the existing geographic

inequalities are due to other constraints such as inadequate

provision of public -qoods and poor infrastructure facilities,mainly roads, electricity, and telecommunication facilities.

Hence, to remedy the regional imbalances, it is necessary to

supply the provinces with a wide range of supportin-Q public

goods and infrastructure facilities.

Despite efforts by successive governments, the incomedistribution in Sri Lanka has remained relativelyunchanged throughout post-independence history. As

revealed by periodical consumer finance stn'veys conductedby the Central Bank, the Gini Coefficient depicting the

degree of equality or inequality in income distribution has

remained in a narrow range around 0.5 since 1953. Thereason fol the visible non-improvement in income

Part IChapter 1 - ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, OUTLOOKAND POLICIES

distribution has been the low economic growth attained by

Sri Lanka dunng this period. As a result, new job creations

have been low, thereby stunting the ability of the poor to

cross the poverty line through the normal development

process. The poorly targeted pro-poor policies too have not

contributed to alleviate this problem. Hence, it is of utmostimportance to continue to adopt a pro-poor pro-growthpolicy both to raise ,erowth and to increase efficiency

in targeting.

Production and Sectoral Performance

Agriculturet, The Agriculture sector, which grew moderately in 2003,declined in 2004 due to a drop in paddy and coconutproduction. The prolonged drought, resulting from thefailure of the Northeast monsoon and the delay in the onset

of the Southwest monsoon in}Of,4,was the main contributor

to this decline. However, the production of other subsidiary

food crops and vegetables improved, as farmers shifted from

paddy to these crops to make maximum use of the availablewater. Tea production recovered partly from the flood

damage in May 2003. Rubber production increased further,

responding to attractive international market prices. Coconutoutput, which grew by 7 per cent in 2003, dropped

mar_einally in2004. Sugar production continued to increasewith the active participation of the private sector. Thelivestock sector displayed a mixed performance, while thefisheries sector reported a marginal improvement.o The share of agriculture in GDP in 2004 was 17.9 percent. This share, though relatively lower than thecontribution by the other two sectors, is significant when

compared with the share of agriculture of other countries. In

developed countries, this share is as low as I-Zper cent, andin rapidly developing countries, it is around l0 per cent.t Over the years, the share of agriculture in GDP hasdeclined internationally. The declining share is due to

several inherent drawbacks that limit agricultural growth anddevelopment, Major drawbacks are the income-inelas.tic

nature of demand for a-Ericultural products, fragmented andlimited extent of land inhibiting the realisation of economies

of scale, migration of labour to other human capital intensivesectors, and the difficulty in competing for factors ofproduction with the Industry and Services sectors. In view ofthese, some countries with limited land area, such as

Singapore have opted out of traditional a_ericulture, and

others such as the USA, Japan and the EU provide substantial

subsidies and protection to their Agriculture sectors, whilepromoting value added agriculture throu,qh research.o The key to raising agricultural productivity is theintroduction of high yielding varieties, improved

irrigation and water management practices, the use of

new technology such as drip irrigation and poly tunnels,

the adoption of research and technological developmentsand advanced crop practices through internationalpartnerships, and the efficient use of inputs, such asfertiliser, pesticides and water. Sri Lanka has attempted to

address these issues in the past through government led

research and development programmes. While such research

and development pro_qrammes have created a number ofinnovations, they have not kept pace with globaldevelopments, presumably due to the desire to conduct

tundamental research, rather than adopting more pragmatic

ways of adaptation and replication. Fundamental research

takes a longer time to yield the desired results, the sector's

issues are so acute that it cannot wait that lon-e. The most

urgent strategy should theretore, be to adopt the already

developed advanced technology, high yielding crop varieties

and more efficient a-{ricultural practices at the field levels.

For this purpose, mutually beneficial partnerships should bepromoted between the local private enterprises and their

counterparls in neighbouring countries.r Another requirement for the development of theAgriculture sector is to have a market oriented, consistentand well-specified trade policy in place. The trade policy

on certain a,ericultural commodities, especially import tariff,

was revised in several instances in 2004 with the twocompeting objectives of reducing the cost of living and

enhancing famter incomes. Such ad-hoc policy changes harm

the lon-{-term sustainability of the Agricultural sector through

their price-distortionary effects.

Industrys Industry sector registered a growth of 5. 2 per cent in2004. All sub sectors in the Industry sector, except

the electricity and water sub-sectors, contributed to its

high pertbrmance.

Factory industry, the largest sub sector in theManufacturing sector, expanded by 6.1 per cent in 2004.

This sub sector contributed 59 per cent to the overall growthin industry in 2004. The growth was moderate in the first

half, but picked up strongly in the second half of the year. As

was the trend in the past, private sector industries accounted

for an overwhelmin-ely high share of the output in the factory

industry sector, which stood at 96 per cent in 2004.

The major contribution to the growth in factory industryin 2004 (over 90 per cent) arose from four of the ninemajor industrial categories, viz., textile, apparel and leather

productsl food, beverages and tobacco products: chemical,

petroleum, rubber and plastic products; and non-metallicproducts. Both export and domestic market oriented

Promoting Conrpetitiveness in Sri Lanka

The competitiveness of a country is delined as its ability toachieve superiority or supremacy throu,eh managin_e its

assets, people and processes. The prosperity of a nation and

the living standards of its people are stron,sly affected by itscompetitiveness. Competitiveness is relative. It is also

changeable. It depends on government policies and the

business environment, which determine the ability to act

and react within the competitive environment, the potential

of people in implementing the necessar) strate_9ic chan_qes

and the sophistication of enterprise s. Competitiveness canonly be sustained jf these factors continue to be present in

an economy.

Competitiveness is generated by the decision making

processes of enterprises at the micro level, operating inevery sector of the economy. The policies aimed atpromoting competitiveness should f'ocus on minimising

systemic risks and providing a sound business environment

in which enterprises can choose trom a vast range of options

to improve their competiriveness. The enterprises rvilljud-eervhat is best for them and ultimately determine thecompetitive outcome.

The experiences of hi_ehly competitive countries in theworld have shown that expanding a country's market share

throu-eh providing subsidies or holdin_e down rva-ees doesnot increase its competitiveness on a sustainable basis.Subsidies have proved to be ineffective in enhancing

competitiveness, as they provide only a temporary shelterfor industries. The resources used to support these could be

employed more productively elsewhere. It has been further

proved that imposin-e afiiticialprice adjustments on tar-eeted

sectors or bringing down input prices artificially too doesnot actually help a country to raise competitiveness.Sustainable competitiveness is created only through

improvements in productivity. Higher productivity allows

a country to support high wa-ees, a stron-s curTency and an

attractive return on capital arrd, with them, high standardsof living for people. Therefore, the role of the governmentshould be to provide a sound macroeconomic and

institutional framervork, leaving enterprises to take businessdecisions torvards the improvement of competitiveness

industries performed well in 2004. They benefited from the

-elobal economic recovery, increased domestic consumer

demand, the low interest rate regime, continuation of the

ceasefire, and improvements in basic industrial infrastructurefacilities such as telecommunications, information

technology, port services and the simplification of Customsprocedures. The competitiveness in export-oriented

industries was facilitated by the improvement in productivity

and rationalisation of productron costs.s The textile and apparel quota system, which was in place

over the last two decades, came to an end on 0l January

2005. However, its impact on industries in 2005 may not be

significant. Since this was announced at least a decade ago,

a gradual restructuring process has been taking place in SriLanka to face the competition driven trading system in a

quota free world. The restructuring took place by way ofproduct specialisation, acquisition and mergers, processimprovements, technology developments, skillsdevelopments, forming strategic alliances, developing

backward linka-{es and improving marketin-e capabilities. As

a result, the industry was able to create a good image in the

international markets for price, quality and speed of delivery.The sector will also benefit from concessions beins

negotiated with major trading partners.

Services* Over the years, the Services sector has generated impetus

to economic growth in Sri Lanka, as experienced in many

developed and developing countries.In 20H,the Services

sector grew by 7.6 per cent contributing 77 per cent to the

economic growth. The sector covers a broad spectrum of

services, with major contributors to overall growth being

Wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants (25 per

cent), Transport, storage and communication (34 per cent),

and Financial, real estate and business services (12 percent).s In the wholesale and retail trade sub sector, trade relatingto both exports and imports grew significantly in 2004,adding value to the Services sector. Export trade grew by7.7 per cent and import trade grew by 9 per cent. The

domestic trade sub sector grew by a modest 1.7 per-cent in2004 reflecting the overall decline in the production of

a-ericultural goods, The hotels and restaurants sub sector grewby 15.9 per cent in 2004 benefiting from the increasein tourist arrivals by l3.l per cent to a record level of

566,202 arrivals.* The value addition in the Transport, storage andcommunication sector grew by 13.7 per cent in 2004. Thegrowth was driven by the notervorthy performance in thetelecommunications and cargo handling sub-sectors, The

telecommunications sub-sector, rvhich has continued to grow

at a high pace, expanded further by 3l per cent in 2004. The

porl services recorded a healthy growth of 12.3 per cent in2004 indicatin-e the expansion in sea cargo handling

activities. The transport sub sector, one of the largest services

sectors in the economy, grew by 4.2 per cent.s The Financial services, real estate and business services

sector grew by 5.7 per cent in 2004 as against 8.8 per centin the year 2003. The deceleration was mainly due to slowergrowth of the banking sub-sector after the hi_eh growth

recorded last year. Although the credit -qrowth in the banking

sector was as hi,eh as 20 per cent, in response to low interest

rates, the growth of net interest income earned from core

banking activities was low compared to last year. Further,

non-interest income had also tallen sharply due to the decline

in gains from trading in securities. The insurance, leasing and

non-bank financial institutions sub-sectors outperformed the

banking sub sector.

Consumption, Savings and Investment? The Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE) increased by

18.4 per cent in 2004.In national income accounting, the

GDP of Rs.2,029 billion is represented on the expenditure

side by total domestic demand plus net external demand

which is measured in terms of net export of goods and non-

factor services. The total domestic demand, which is alsoGDE is composed of domestic consumption and gross

domestic capital formation, or investment. In 2004, GDE

increased by 18.4 per cent to Rs.2,214 billion, and net

external demand is estimated at a negative Rs.l85 billion.o Consumption expenditure at current market prices was

estimated at Rs.l,707 billion, an increase of 15.2 per centover 2003. This retlects an increase of 9.8 per cent in the

average price level and an increase of 4.9 per cent in real

consumption, which is lower than the growth in GDP in real

terms. The pent-up demand for consumption following the

ceasefire has already been met during the first two years of

the ceasetlre. Of the totalconsumption, private consumption

as a per cent of GDP declined marginally ftom76.2 per centin 2003 to 76 per cent in 2004, while government

consumption increased to 8.1 per cent in 2004 from 7.9 percent in 2003. The higher import tariffs imposed on

non-essential consumer items during the latter part of theyear may have contributed to the slowdown in private

consumptron.s In 2004, the environment for investment was conducive,

encouraged by low interest rates and the continuation ofthe ceasefire. The investment expenditure (-eross domestic

capital folmation) at current market plices was estimated atRs.507 billion, an increase of 30.-5 per cent over 2003.However, in real terms. the investment expenditure gren,

only by 11.7 percent, indicating that the inflationary impact

rvas much lar-{er on the investment expenditure. The growth

in real investment is an indication of the continuation ofimproving investor confldence since the latter part of 2003.The investment/GDP ratio improved significantly to 25 per

cent fiom 22.1 per cent in 2003, although the level of gross

investment was still below the desirable levels required to

achieve a sustainable high economic growth,

Domestic savings, which include both private andgovernment savings, were estimated at Rs.323 billion, anincrease of 15.2 per cent over the previous year. This

increase was solely due to the improvement in private savings

by 18,5 percent. The impetus forthegrowthof private sectorsavings was provided by the increased corporate sectorsavings, in the context of higher profitability and betterperformance. Public sector dis-savin_es, which improved

durin.e the previous two years, deteriorated in 2004, reflecting

the increase in the government's recurent expenditure. The

increase in private sector savings was sufflcient to offset the

increase in public sector dis-savings and thc total domestic

savings ratio (domestic savin_ss/GDP), whrch was 15.9 per

cent in 2003, remained at the same levelin 2004.

The national savings estimated as the sum of domestic

savings, net foreign private transfers and NFIA increasedby 15.5 per cent to Rs. 439 billion. The national savin,esratio (national savin-{s/GDP) at2l.6 per cent also remained

at the same level as in 2003. NFIA remained negative, and

external debt due to hi_eher global interest rates. Net private

transfers, which consists of worker remittances, improved at

a higher rate, mitigating the negative impact of the NFIA.s Consequently, the savings.investment gap increased to

Rs.69 billion (3.4 per cent of GDP) in 2004 from around Rs.8billion (0.5 per cent GDP) in 2003. This gap is reflected as

the current account deficit of the BOP. Since foreign savin_{sby way of net capital inflows were not suff-rcient to finance

the wider savin_qs-investment deficit in2004, the country hadto utilise its official reserves to fill the gap.

Economic and Social Infrastructures A well developed infrastructure system generates a seriesof tradable services and supports continuous ecorlomicgro$th required for poverty alleviation. Failure to provide

adequate infl'astructure developments diverts the domestic

demand for better services available abroad.s The overall poor quality of economic and socialinfrastructure is manifested in several weaknesses. SriLanka's international competitiveness rankin_e is low,undermining its strategic advantages of proximity major searoutes, bein_e and island nation and the prevailing highliteracy rates, and liberal economic policies. Many essentialservices, such as healthcare and education, are beingpurchased abroad by Sri Lankans on an increasing scale,although they could have been developed as significantforeign exchan.ee earners for the country.

increased by 3l per cent to US dollars 38 per ban'el in2004compared to US dollars 29 per barrel in 2003. Thisescalation of petroleum prices was due to several reasons.The global demand for oil giew at its fastest pace in 16

years with significantly higher demand from China, India,United States and Japan. China's oil consumption alone

increased by 20 per cent in 2004. Political tensions in theMiddle East, Venezuela and Nigeria coupled with adverseweather conditions caused supply disruptions. Further, thethin excess capacity, just about I percent above the world'sdaily consumption of 82 million banels, and the financialcrisis that hit the Russian oil company, Yukos, which was

the largest non-OPEC oil producer, also contributed to theoil price hike. Petroleum importin-e countries around theworld, both developing and developed, are facing the

challenge of handling these unexpected and unprecedented

increases in petroleum prices, which are likely to continuein 2005 as well.Sri Lanka imported around 30 million barrels ofpetroleum products in 2004. Of this, about 50 per cent wasin crude form and the balance comprised various types ofrefined products, dominated by auto-diesel. Annualconsumption of major petroleum products, i.e., petrol,

kerosene and auto-diesel amounted to 2.6 billion litres. Thetransportation sector is the leading petroleum consumerfollowed by the power, industrial and household sectors.The demand for petroleum consumption in the transport

sector has shown steady growth with the increasing numberof vehicle registrations. Similarly, the use of petroleumproducts in power generation has also been rapidlyincreasing due to the increased use of thermal power, in theabsence of alternative energy sources and thenofl.implementation of planned coal power andhydropower projects.The economic impact of the oil price hike on oilimportin.e developin-{ countries such as Sri Lanka rvill

largely depend on the resilience of the economy to external

shocks and policy responses to mitigate the impact. The

ma-{nitude of the impact will also depend on the energyintensity of the economy and the availability of alternativeenergy sources such as natural gas, coal power,hydropower, etc. An oil price hike could lead to severeexternal and internal imbalances unless apptopriate

corrective measures are taken, On the external front, sudden

increases in oilprices willwiden the trade balance, leadingto a worsening of the overall balance of payments (BOP)

and a loss of the cou_ntry's fbreign reserves and, exerting

pressure on the exchange rate, The domestic imbalance will

depend on whether a full pass-through of the high oil pricesis allowed. A full pass-through rvill result in 'a one-offinflation, but the absorption of high oil prices by thegovernment through the payment of subsiciies will lead tocompounded economic issues such as the widening of thebudget deficit, rising public debt:and interest rates,crowding out private investment, widening inequality andlong-term inflation.High international oil prices rvould lead to seriousmacroeconomic imbalances through the deterioration of theBOP of the country unless early and timely correctivemeasures are taken. The total expenditule on petroleum

imports in2004 increased by US dollars 372 million (by aaper cent) to US dollars l,2Il million, si-4nificantlycontributing to the widening of the trade deficit and thedeficit in the overall BOP. The rvorsening trade balancewould also exert an adverse impact on the exchange rate andexternal reserves.

As pel the pricing formula introduced in January 2002,;the domestic prices of major petroleum products areexpected to be revised monthly. However', the domesticprices have not been adjusted fully in terms of the pricingtbrmula since January 2004. This resulted in heav1, lossesto petroleum companies requifing the government toprovide subsidies. A subsidy of one rupee on a litre of'petrol, diesel and kerosene amounts to a subsidy of Rs.2.6billion per annum. The total subsidy commitments by thegovernment to petroleum companies amounted to Rs.l8billion or about 0,9 per cent of the GDP in 2004.

To finance a lar$e fuel subsidy, the govemment needsto increase taxes, or reduce its expenditure elsewhere, orborrow. If taxes are increased, everyone, both users of fuel

and non-users are affected. Holever, because the taxationwill usually be through indirect taxes; lower income groupswill bear a greater burden of the tax than high-incomegroups. If the government has to reduce its expenditureelsewhere, then its ability to provide assistance to

disadvantaged groups will be reduced or its ability to investin intiastructure projects essential for long term c

development will be curtailed. If the government sborrowing ftom the domestic market, this reduces the

resources available for the piivate sector through crowdingout or leads to inflation if borrowine is effected from thebanking:system, A rise in inftati-On due to increased

government bonowings aiising from the fuel subsidy wouldhurt the poor most as they will not have the ability to hedgeagainst inflation. SuCh government borrowing will not onlyhave an adverse impact on the well being of the currentgeneration but:also on the future generations. Further, aIarge part of the subsidy will go to rhe hands of the aifluenr,

In addition to the implementation of the pricingformula to reflect international price domesticfuel prices, there are several other sup 'r.urur.,that could minimise the adverse impact of high oil prices onthe economy. For example, road congestion Ieads:to large-scale wastage of fuel. Hence, developing appropriate

such as.water are being exploited in an unsustainable manner

in the absence of proper pricing. Therefore, a renewed effort

to develop the infiastructure is essential for the economy togrow in a sustainable manner,In 2004, several enterprises supplying economicinfrastructure were brought under the SEMA, which was

established to improve efficiency in those entelprises. The

financial performance of CEB, SLR and CPC has seriously

worsened. It could even threaten the macroeconomic stabilitygiven the strategic importance of the services they provide

to the national economy.

The electricity sector suffered from twin shocks, thedrought and the high petroleum prices in 2004,increasing the cost of power generation. The unchangedprices led to the deterioration in the finaneial position ofCEB, requiring greater budgetary support. The delay in

implementing new power projects includin_s the coal power

plant, and the proposed reforms, and the continuation of high

system losses compounded the issues in the electricity sector.The petroleum sector suffered from a majorinternational price shock in 2004, with a surge ininternational prices (Brent) by 35 per cent over 2003adversely impacting on the Sri Lankan economy.The delayed and inadequate adjustment of fuel prices

undisturbed by the international price movements led to a

continued increase in domestic consumption of fuel, losses

incuned by the CPC and Lanka IOC (LIOC). consequential

subsidy payments by the government, and a deterioration in

the BOP.Sri Lanka enjoys a comparative advantage ininternational marine transportation,largely due to itsstrategic location, but, the competitiveness of thecountry depends largely on the efficiency of the port

services and how well this network is linked with theinternal transportation network. Althou,eh the coverage

of Sri Lanka's road network is satisfactory by international

standards, the quality of roads is very poor. Major problemsassociated with road development in Sri Lanka areexcessive delays in the implementation of planned road

projects, and the inability to secure sufficient funds neededfor new road projects and the maintenance of the existing

road network.

Port services recorded a healthy growth in 2004,benefiting from the growth in international trade andproductivity improvements. However, port services

continued to face challenges from regional competition.

Further improvements to port efficiency and productivity

and the timely completion of the proposed Colombo SouthHarbour project are needed to successfully face

these challenges.

The road passenger transport sector continued to sufferfrom inadequate service, poor quality and low degree ofpassenger safet_y. The state owned cluster bus companies(CBCs) were incurrin_u huge losses leadin_s to heavy

dependence on government assistance. The railway

transportation system suffers from Ligidities in pricin-e,

mana-qement and labour, leadin-e to poor quality of its

services and heavy operational losses, thereby imposing a

severe burden on the budget. To facilitate SL.R to overcome

its deflciencies within a corporate structure, it was convefted

to an Authority in 2003, but due to agitation by unions, the

change was withdrawn in January 2005.

Benefited by the ceasefire, both domestic andinternational air travel increased during the last three

years. Vital retorms were brought into the civil aviation

sector, leading to a greater degree of deregulation, and

adopting bilateral liberalisation agreements to attract more

international carriers and tourists to the country.

A sustainable water supply for both consumption andirrigation is a national priority. Achievin-e sustainabile useof water resources requires improved water management

practices to prevent wastage and over exploitation. Two

major factors threatening the long term sustainability of

water resources in Sri Lanka are improper pricing and

deficiencies in regulation. Pipe borne drinking water is

subject to a price, with a cross subsidy segment, but other

forms of water supply are not regulated to prevent over

exploitation and environmental damages.

The public health sector suffered from several major

setbacks in 2004, mainly due to frequent labour disputes, the

deteriorating quality of its services and an outbreak of

Dengue Fever (DF) and Dengue Hemonhagic Fever (DHF).

These illustrate the continuing difficulties in maintaining theheavy public funding of the government health care

programmes provided to all sections of the populationwithout targetin,t. Proper targeting could save funds for

improving preventive health care as private sector investors

have no or minimal incentive in promoting preventive

healthcare.A continuously improving education system is aprerequisite for rapid growth and development. The

university education in Sri Lanka is the least developed as

indicated by the large number of students who are unable to

receive university education. Agitation within Sri Lanka has

discouraged the government from deregulating the hi-eher

education sector, which is akin to regulating or restricting

domestic production in favour of imports. However, it should

be noted that at the time of Independence, Sri Lanka attracted

students tiom many fbreign countries due to its high qualityuniversity education, but the situation has changedsignificantly over the years. Sri Lankan students today

proceed in lar-ee numbers to other countries including India

and Nepal, for hi-eher education due to inadequate availability

of similar facilities in the country. The dere-eulation of the

university education has to be accompanied by acomprehensive scheme oi accreditation, continuous

monitorin-9 and periodic evaluation to maintain the required

standards.{s Alternative means of supplying higher education need to

be explored in considering of the serious deficiency inhigher education opportunities in the country.

International studies show that the social rate of return on

primary and secondary education is si-enificantly higher than

the private rate of return, justifyin-u continuing the public

investment in primary and secondary education. However,

the private rate of return is higher in terliary education, thus

questionin-e the economic rationale behind Sri Lanka'scontinuous dependency on public investment for

higher education.

Prices, Wages and Employments Inflation increased in 2004. This was observed both inwholesale and retail price indices.The rising trend inprices was seen at the regional level as well, but price

disparities amon-q the regional centres narrowed due to

improvements in distribution, flow of information and

transport facilities.

rD Both supply and demand factors exerted pressure oninflation in 2004. Among the supply factors, theprolonged drought in certain areas of the country

and increased international prices of key commodities,specially petroleum, were prominent, These were

exacerbated by the depreciation of the rupee against major

international cunencies, and the upward revision of the Value

Added Tax (VAT) on imports. The expansion of the money

supply at a hi-eh rate of around 20 per cent in 2004 compared

to around 15 percent in the previous year, added pressure on

prices from the demand side. A higher bud-uet deficit partly

financed through banking sources, and an accelerated

expansion in credit to the private sector also contributed to

the pressure on prices.6 Nominal wages in the public sector, rvhich had remained

unchanged in 2003, increased at both the beginning and

the end of the year. An average wage increase in the public

sector was seen at the beginning of the year both in nominaland real terms. In contrast to public sector wage

developments, some employee cate,eories in the organised

private sector faced reductions in real minimum wages, while

nominal wages in the unorganised private sector generally

kept abreast with inflation.s A new compensation formula applicable to termination

of employment rvas introduced in March 2005. In 2004,tollowing the representations made by trade unions, theMinistry of Labour Relations and Foreign Employment

16Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2004

(MLRFE), through a cabinet decision on 26 May 2004,

suspended the implementation of the amended Terminationof Employment of Workmen Act (TEWA), which wassubsequently implemented using a new compensationfbrmula gazetted in March 2005.* Population growth slowed dorvn marginally from 1.3 percent in 2003 to l.l per cent in 2004. Areas which werepreviously affected by the security situation registeredrelatively hi_eher growth in population which has resulted indistrict-wise diff'erences in growth rates,* The employment rate increased marginally with theexpansion of economic activity, particularly in theServices sector, in 2004. However, the labour forceparticipation rate had declined with the inclusion of theNorthern Province, where the participation rate wasrelatively low. The employment rate was also supported bythe expansion in public sector employment opportunitiesunder the policy of the new government and its drive torecruit graduates to the public sector. However,unemployment, recording a mar_einal rise during the year,remained an area of concern, particularly amon-q the

educated youth.s The impact of the tsunami disaster on prices, wages andemployment will be seen particularly in the fisheriessector in 2005. Fish prices did not rise immediately due to

a temporary reduction in demand, but have risen since thenwith the increasing demand. The supply shofia-{e is expectedto continue until the required infrastructure is in place.Meanwhile, prices of other protein substitutes have already

risen. Trading activities in the affected areas have also beendisrupted. Marketing and distribution in coastal areas willtake a while to recover, so that prices and wa_ees in those

economic sectors will also remain affected for sometime. Therehabilitation and reconstruction activities could also exertpressure on input prices, including wages of skilled labour,unless due consideration is -qiven to the limitations of

resource availability.

International Trade and the Balance ofPayments* External trade expanded considerably with an increasein both exports and imports. Building on the recovery in

2003, the extemal sector in2004 benefited from the highestglobal economic growth recorded in the past few decades,and demonstrated a hi_eher growth in trade, but faced anumber of challenges resulting from several internal andexternal shocks.# Exports in US dollar terms grew by l2,2per cent in 2004outperforming the 9.2 per cent growth in 2003, andrecording the highest annual growth since 2000. Export

earnin-es increased as a composite outcome of the volume

-growth of 7.8 per cent and the unit price increase of 4 percent, to US dollars 5,757 million. Industrial exports

preponderate in export earnin_{s with a high share of 78 per

cent, while a_ericultural exporls account tbr only l9 per cent.

Hence, the contribution to the -erowth in exports in 2004 wasmostly from the industrial sector, which contributed 85 per

cent, while the balance came from a-tricultural and mineral

exports. The growth of industrial exports by l3 per cent wasled predominantly by the strong performance attained bytextiles and garments, machinery and equipment, and rubber

based products. This was supported by increased marketaccess that was afforded to the sector through tradenegotiations. The apparel industry was able to minimise thepotential nsks arising from the heavy concentration in the USmarket by expanding the market share in the EU. Garment

exports to the EU market benefited from the special incentive

arrangement with the EU under the Generalised System ofPreferences (GSP) scheme since February 2004.* Imports grew by 19.9 per cent to US dollars 8,000 million,compared with 9.3 per cent growth in 2003, as acombined effect of increases in both volume (9 per cent)and prices (9.7 per cent). The higher _erowth in imporrs

reflects the impact of the economic expansion, the prolon_eed

drou-eht, the escalation of oilprices and the low interest rate

re*eime. The economic expansion increased the imports ofinvestment and intermediate _{oods, while the droughtconditions led to an escalation of the import of food items,

and petroleum products. Following the long-term trend, the

share of consumer -Eoods imports continued to shrink in2004

to 20 per cent, while the share of intermediate and investment

goods imports increased to 58 and 2l per cent, respectively.The sharp rise in the share of intermediate goods was partly

due to the historically high international oil pnces.t The terms of trade recorded a deterioration of 5.2 percent in 2004. This was led by the increase in import pricesof both intermediate and investment goods, especially,petroleum, fertiliser, wheat, transport equipment andmachinery and equipment. Although export prices of tea,rubber, .other a,ericultural exports and industrial exportsincreased, it was not sufficient to improve the terms of trade.s The trade deficit widened to US dollars 2,243 million,which was partly flrnanced by net earnings in the servicesaccount and remittances, thereby containing the impactof the widened deficits in the trade and income accountson the current account. The higher global economic growthand the peaceful domestic environment helped touristearnings to continue their growth momentum, whichcontributed to a surplus in the services account. Workerremittances grew at a healthy rate of above I I per cent in2004, rctainin_q their position as the largest net inflow to thecountry. The deficit in the income account widened by l9 per

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - ZOO417

cent to US dollars 204 million largely due to higher global

interest rates, which increased outflows more than the

increase in income f'rom investment. However, the surpluses

in the services and transfer accounts were not sufflcient tofully offset the widened deficits in the trade and income

accounts, thus worsening the cufient account balance to US

dollars 648 million (3.3 percent of GDP) from US dollars 7l

million (0.4 per cent of GDP) in 2003.t The overall position of the external sector was

further aggravated by the lower net inflows to the capitaland financial account, mainly due to the lower than

expected foreign aid disbursements to the government.

The total long-term inflows to the government decreased byl6 percent to US dollars 771 million in 2004, while the

outflows declined by US dollars 28 million to US dollars 331million. The significant decline in programme loans to US

dollars 30 million in 2004 from US dollars 226 million in

2003 was largely due to delays in the implementation of

structural reforms, The disbursement of project loans, whrch

also slowed down during early 2004, recovered later due to

the faster implementation of projects towards the endof the year. As a temporary measure to overcome the

shortfall in external financing on concessional terms, the

government issued foreign culrency denominated bonds on

commercial terms.o The favourable developments in capital flows to theprivate sector partly mitigated the shortfall in official

inflows. Capital flows to the private sector by way of foreign

direct investment, loan capital and portfolio investment

improved significantly during 2004, reflecting improved

foreign investor confidence. The implementation of a large

number of BOI agreements that were contracted earlier

contributed to the increase in realised FDI, includingprivatisation proceeds, by 2 per cent to US dollars 233

million during 20M. The successful US dollar 100 million

bond issue by Sri Lanka Telecom was the main contributor

to the increase in net tbreign loan capital to the private sector'e Net inflows to the capital and fltnancial account were not

sufficient to offset the current account deficit, and hence,

the overall BOP recorded a deficit reversing surpluses

recorded in the previous three consecutive years. This led to

a decline in external official reserves to US dollars 2,196

million (3.3 months of imports) by end December 2004 from

US dollars 2,329 million (4.2 months of imports) at end 2ffi}

increasing the country's vulnerability to extemal shocks. ByApril 2005, the BOP position has turned positive and

reserves have also risen.s In this adverse environment, the exchange rate became

volatile, particularly during the middle of the year. The

rupee depreciated by 7.5 per cent against the US dollar during

the year compared to the mar-einal depreciation of 0.01 per

cent during 2003. The interventions by the Central Bank up

to net sales of US dollars 514.7 mitlion smoothened out some

volatility. Since the US dollar depreciated against other major

intemational currencies, the rupee depreciated at even higher

rates against those currencies. However, reflecting the

relatively high domestic inf'lation, the real effective exchange

rate (REER) depreciated, with respect to the 5 cunency and24 currency baskets, by 1.0 per cent and 1.1 per cent,

respectively indicating a marginal improvement in Sri

Lanka's competitiveness. Activities in the foreign exchange

market also reflected the uncertainty as the share of forward

transactions in the total volume of transactions droppedto2S

per cent in 2004 from 38 per cent in 2003. The forward

premia also remained well above interest rate differentials

during most of the year, reflecting the market expectation of

a higher depreciation or a rise in interest rates. However, in

the first four months of 2005, following the tsunami disaster,

the rupee appreciated against all major cunencies.o The country's total external debt as a percentage of GDP

declined marginally, reflecting the lower net loan capital

inflows during the year. However, the debt stock increased

by 7 per cent to US dollars I1,346 million at end 2004 mainly

due to the depreciation of the US dollar against the Yen and

the SDR, as 73 per cent of the total external debt was

denominated in those two currencies. The debt service ratios

deteriorated mar-{inally due to the large repayment of IMF

loans during the year. However, the ratios remained

satisfactory, since over 90 per cent ofthe total external debt

consists of concessional medium and long term debt of the

government.

Fiscal Policy, Budgetary Operations and PublicDebto Fiscal policy in 2004 was aimed at achieving the targets

stipulated in the FMRA and the objectives laid down in

the Economic Policy Framework of the Government of

Sri Lanka released in July 2004. Thus, the thrust of fiscal

policy was placed on continuing the fiscal consolidation

process, increasing public investment, strengthening debt

management, developing debt markets, restructuring public

enterprises, providing relief to the general public, and

enhancing transparency and accountability in conducting

fiscal operations, which will complement the sustainable

medium term growth prospects in the economy.

G Overall fiscal management and the achivement of fiscal

targets, were a challenge in 2004, due to adverse external

and domestic shocks that led to a slippage in revenue

collection and an over-iun in recurrent expenditure. In

addition, the delays and the lower than expected foreign

financing and privatisation proceeds aggravated the difficulty

in managing public finance.

Part Ichapter 1 - EcoNoMtc PERFoRMANCE, OUTLOOK AND pOLtCtES

The declining trend in the tax revenue/GDP ratioreversed in2004,reflecting the impact of the widening ofthe tax base and improving tax collection. The tax revenue

increased to 13.9 percent from 13.2 per cent of GDP in 2003,reflectin,e increases in revenue tiom VAT, import duty and

excise duty, despite the reduction in the revenue from incometax. The revenue tiom VAT increased due to improvements

in both VAT administration and the refund mechanism. The

upward revisions of excise taxes and import duties coupledwith increased values of production and imports which are

subject to such taxes contributed to the increase in revenue.

The total revenue collection in2004 was 15.6 per cent ofGDP, that is, a shortfatl of 0.9 per cent of GDP comparedto the budgetary target of 16.4 per cent of GDP, It was alsomarginally lower than the level of 15.7 per cent of GDP in2003. The sharp reduction of non-tax revenue from 2.5 per

cent to 1.5 per cent of GDP was mainly responsible for thereduction in total revenue in2004. However, this was moredue to the over-optimistic budgetary targets than theperformance of non-tiu( revenue during the year.

The expenditure overrun in comparison to the envisagedbudgetary target is estimated at about 0.3 per cent ofGDP. However, it declined marginally to 23.5 per cent in2004, from23.7 per cent of GDP in 2003.

The slippage in revenue and expenditure overrunsresulted in an increase in the government's overallbudget deficit from the original target of 6.8 per cent to8.2 per cent of GDP in 2004. The cunent account deflcitwhich mirrors the savings position of the government

increased to 3.9 per cent from 3.3 per cent of GDP and theprimary deficit which reflects the outcome of the currentyear's fiscal operations increased to 2.2per cent fiom 0.9 per

cent of GDP in 2W3. The concomitant public secror deficit

increased to 8.4 per cent of GDP largely due to operational

losses of non flnancial public enterprises, mainly, the CPC

and the CEB,

The increased public sector deficits were financed largelythrough borrowings from domestic sources. The total netdomestic bonowings of the government increased to 5.8 per

cent of GDP (Rs. I l7 billion) compared to the ori.uinal target

of 3.2 per cent of GDP (Rs.65 billion). Both government debtand public sector debt as a percentage of GDP decreasedmarginally to 105.5 percent and 107.5 per cent, respectively,in2004 from 105.8 per cent and 107.9 per cent, respectively,in 2003.

In2004rthe government introduced a series of measuresto improve fiscal performance. Major measures includedreforming the tax and tariff systems, strengthening taxadministration, inter-alia, by settin-e up of the RevenueBoard, introducing the ESC, rationalising recurrent

expenditure, and revisin-q administrative prices, reformingpublic enterprises by settin-q up the SEMA, strengtheningadministrative reforms by establishing the ARC and theNCA, and enhancing transparency in government

procurement by adhering to the reporting requirements of theFMRA and setting up the NPA. In the conrext of a high

degree of income disparity amon_g provinces and low levelsof investments in remote areas, priority was given to public

investment to stimulate sustainable and regionally balancedeconomic growth. These measures would help resolve

several major drawbacks on the fiscal front, such as decliningrevenue/GDP ratio, under-performance of the public

investment progranme, consistently high budget deficits and

the high public debt burden. The timely rectification of those

drawbacks is important, as their impact could spill over to the

rest of the macroeconomic management effbrts through highdemand pressures, excessive resource requirements andcrowding out of private investment.G The MTMF presented with the Budget 2005 aims at a

steady improvement in fiscal performance, high savingsand investment and high economic growth, moderateinflation, and improved external balances. The medium

term fiscal framework could be affected particularly by the

tsunami disaster, as the _qovernment has to provide relief toaffected people, while undertaking rehabilitation and

reconstruction expenditure in connection with the damage toprivate as well as public property. The RRR would require

an estimated resource requirement of about US dollars 1,8billion in the medium term. In view of the domestic resource

constraints, it is essential that the pledged forei_en assistance

is utilised in a timely manner for the government to make

steady progress in this effort.

Monetary Policy, Monetary Aggregates andInterest Rateso The focus of monetary policy in2004 was on the need forminimising inflationary pressures and containing rapidgrowth of monetary aggregates, while facilitating thecontinuing growth momentum in the economy. Monetary

management, however, faced a challenge in2004 given the

need for supporting the growth momentum in a difficult

macroeconomic environment created by several adverse

external and domestic factors, including drou_eht conditions,

the escalation of international crude oil prices and increasedpublic sector domestic bonowings.* The Central Bank conducted its monetary policy in anindependently floating exchange rate regime within aframework of targeting monetary aggregates, Monetarypolicy was implemented through active open market

operations (OMO), which includes, as its main component,

the interest rate corridor formed by the Repurchase (Repo)

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 200419

Pad IChapter 1 - ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

rate and the Reverse Repurchase (Reverse Repo) rate. This

was supplemented by maintaining the Statutory Reserve

Ratio (SRR) unchan-eed at l0 per cent. In the context of

continuous sales of foreign exchange by the Central Bank to

prevent high exchange rate volatility, the Central Bank

injected funds through the purchase of Treasury bills in the

primary market, to prevent a liquidity shofta-qe in the money

market and any undue fluctuations in interest rates.

The difficult economic conditions that prevailed in 2004required proper timing and sequencing of monetary

policy tightening. With the further acceleration of inflation

and monetary growth by mid-200.1, as the first step, the

Central Bank began to conduct OMO ag-{ressively in June2004 and absorbed almost the entirety of the liquidity

surplus, inducing an upward adjustment in the short-term

cost of funds, so as to contain the growth in monetary

a-g,qregates. Second, the Bank's Repo and Reverse Repo rates

were raised by 50 basis points each in November 2004.

Meanwhile, to contain non-essential consumption such as the

importation of motor vehicles, a 100 per cent margin deposit

requirement was enforced on letters of credit opened tbr the

importation of motor vehicles for private use.

Following the tsunami disaster, the Central Bankimplemented several measures enabling a speedy

recoyery of the economy. Immediate measures were taken

to ensure the smooth functionin-q of the financialmarket and

the payments and settlement systems. The daily OMO

auctions were temporarily suspended fiom early January

2005 to end February 2005 to keep the money market liquid.A special loan scheme was formulated and implementedthrough the banking system to provide credit at a

concessionary rate to help revive affected industries and to

rebuild livelihoods of affected people.

Throughout 2004, monetary aggregates continued to

expand above the desired path. Reserve money, the

operating target of monetary policy, has been about Rs. 6

billion higher than the expected level in the annual monetary

programme. Meanwhile, broad money (Mrn),which is the

intermediate target, also recorded a faster than expected

growth due to higher increases in credit to both the public

sector and the private sector.

The growth in reserve money was entirely a result of an

increase in net domestic assets (NDA) of the Central Bank

as net foreign assets (NFA) of the Central Bank declined,

reflecting the deficit in the balance of payments in 2004.

The decline in NFA was mainly a result of delays in receipts

of foreign programme financing to the government and the

sales of foreign exchange by the Central Bank to contain

excessive volatility in the foreign exchan-ee market. The

Central Bank resorted to purchasing Treasury bills from the

primary market to prevent a potential liquidity crunch and to

ensure the smooth functioning of the financial system,

Consequently, NDA of the Central Bank increased sharply,p The erpansionary impact of reserve mone,v rvas reflectedin the high growth in both narrorv and broad monetary

aggregates, which accelerated in the latter part of the

year. Narrow money supply, which comprises currency and

demand deposits held by the public, expanded by 16.6 per

cent in 2004. During the first half of the year, broad money(Mrn) -erowth was in the range of 15 - l6 per cent and

fluctuated in a higher range of 17 - 19.6 per cent durin,q the

second half of 2004.r Private sector credit expansion, which increased at afaster rate towards the end of 2003, continued to

accelerate in 2004, thereb"v contributing largely to themonetary expansion. Private sector credit increased by

Rs.l 15 billion in 2004, a point-to-point growth of 22per cent.

compared with a growth of l7 per cent as at end 2003. The

credit expansion of a higher magnitude was a reflection of the

continued recovery in economic activities, expansion in

foreign trade and the decline in lendin-e rates in real terms.

The composition of credit indicates that the high demand for

credit in 2004 was mainly in respect of commerce, finance,

housing and consumption related activities.r During 2004, net credit to the government (NCG) from

the banking system increased at a higher than expected

rate due to an increase in the budget deficit, and shortfallsin projected foreign financing and the realisation ofprivatisation proceeds. Limitations in the availability of

non-bank sector resources for budgetary financing led to this

increase in bank credit to the,eovernment. Accordingly, NCG

from the banking system increased by about Rs.44 billion in

2004. An increase in credit to public corporations by Rs.5

billion in 2004, in contrast to the repayments expected at the

beginning of the year also contributed to the growth in money

supply.G Meanwhile, the contribution to monetary growth fromNFA was lower than projected. NFA of the bankingsystem improved marginally in 2004, due to the

improvement in NFA of commercial banks and a decline in

NFA of the Central Bank. The contribution of NFA to the

growth in money supply was about 2 per cent.* The declining trend in interest rates that prevailed

throughout 2003 reversed with a marginal increase in

2004, due to risin-e inflation, higher inflation expectations,

increasing credit demand and tightening of monetary policy.

In 2004, real intertst rates in almost all markets also became

negative as inflation increased at a faster rate than the

increase in interest rates. Call money market rates were

relatively more volatile, occasionally risin-e above the upper

bound of the Central Bank interest rate corridor in 20&1. Bothlending and deposit rates of commercial banks increased

durin_u the year. The average weighted prime lending rate(AWPR), and the avera_qe wei-uhted deposit rate (AWDR)increased in the latter part of the year. Following theincreases in international rates by the end of the year,commercial banks in Sri Lanka also increased their interest

rates on foreign currency deposits and lending.* The yields on government securities also increased, withlong-term rates rising by a higher margin. The yields atthe weekly Treasury bill auctions increased during the firstseven months of the year, but declined thereafter, asgovernment bonowing shifted to foreign currency sourceswith the issue of Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs)

and institutional investors increased their role in the primaryTreasury bill market. Given investor preference for short-term instruments, treasury bond issues in 2004 consistedmore of shorter maturities. The secondary market yields ongovernment securities moved upward, with hi,eher increases

at the longer end, thus reflecting llgher inflation expectationsin the medium term.

Financial Sector Developments and Stabilitys Benefiting from the continued economic growth, financialsector activities expanded further and the financialsystem remained resilient in2004 amidst several internaland external shocks. The anay of financial instruments andservices expanded, and trading volumes in financial markets

increased in2004 with many market indices reaching recordhigh levels. Several initiatives were taken in2004to enhance

access to finance, especially to strengthen the availability offinancial facilities to micro-enterprises and SMEs.Meanwhile, the financial infrastructure was modernised withsignificant refbrms in the payment system. During 2004, theregulatory and supervisory framework was furtherstrengthened to improve the soundness of the bankingsystem, while moving further in line with international bestpractice. A number of legislative and re_eulatory reformswere implemented in 2004 to strengthen the legal andregulatory framework and promote efficiency and stability in

the financial sector.* The expansion in the financial system was evidenced byimprovements in several financial sector indicators.Among these were the increase in deposits, loans and

advances granted, service outlets of the financial institutions,

lease and hire purchase facilities, and insurance activities thathave been expandin_e in a healthy and competitivemarket environment. Many financial institutions alsoexpanded the array of financial services offered to theircustomers while introducing new value added services.Reflecting these developments, the total assets of the

financial system in nominal terms expanded by l5 per centin20M. Value addition in the financial services increased by

6.6 per cent in 2004. However, this was lower than the 10.6per cent growth registered in 2003 due to the combined

outcome of the base eftect of higher growth in profits in

2003, nanowing interest margin and the reduction in capital

gains from investments,e Financial markets recorded a further expansionas seen in the trading volumes in many marketsegments. Activities in the short-term inter-bank callmoney market and the primary market for governmentsecurities increased further, but the secondarymarket transactions in government securities declined in

view of the uncertainties regarding interest rates. The volumeof transactions in the foreign exchange market increased,benefiting from expanded external trade activity in 2004.The equity market showed an improved performance withshare price indices, daily trading volumes and marketcapitalization reaching record levels in2004. The nascent

corporate bond market continued to suffer from issue costs,insufficient awareness of market participants and

the availability of altemative easy bank financing, especiallybank credit at attractive rates, particularly for

blue chip companies.s Several measures were taken to upgrade and strengthen. the payments and settlement system and the regulatorysystem in 20M, with a view to enhancing the efficiency,competitiveness, and resilience, and the soundness of thefinancial sector. Further development of the payments and

settlement system was undertaken by linking the Real Time

Gross Settlement (RTGS) sysrem implemented in 2003 withthe Scripless Securities Settlement (SSS) system and the

Central Depository system (CDS) for government securitiesto facilitate the settlement of government securities in

scripless form.o The regulatory framework was further strengthened byintroducing new laws and directions. In this regard, theCentral Bank applied the capital adequacy requirement on aconsolidated basis covering the subsidiaries, streamlinedprovisiohing requirements for non performing loans (NPLs),

issued -euidelines on extemal auditors and required banks toobtain and publish credit ratings by mid 2005. Anamendment to the Banking Act was approved by theParliament to strengthen the regulatory framework. A new

Payments and Settlement Systems bill has also been draftedto strengthen the le-eal framework governing payments,clearin-e and settlements systems in Sri Lanka, whileproviding a comprehensive law on payment transactions.s The tsunami devastation at the end of 2004 has not posed

a major challenge to the stability of the flrnancial sector

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2OO421

Part IChapter 1 - ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

although there are several other downside risks to the

maintenance of financial system stability in 2005. The

world economic environment, though favourable at present,

could become unceftain due to several f'actors such as the

slowin-q down of global economic growth, continuing

uncertainties in petroleum prices, rising intemational interest

rates with the gradual removal of policy stimuli, and the

continuation of si-enificantly large twin deficits, i.e., the flscal

deficit and the external cun'ent account defrcit in the USA.

The domestic economic environment could also suff'er from

continuing uncertaintie s on inflation, aid flows, fuel prices,

and the possible slowing down of international trade arisin-e

from the fall-out effects of the termination of the MFA and

due to threats to achieving fiscal consolidation. High credit

expansion could also pose a threat to the stability of the

financial system, if care is not taken to ensure asset quality.

However, the sector will be able to manage these risks

successfully given the continued strengthening of financial

institutions and improved risk mana-qement strategies for the

payments and settlement systems, and strengthening of the

regulatory and supervisory framewori:G In spite of the expansion in financial sector activity,there are some issues and challenges that requireattention. One of the main issues is the relatively high

intermediation cost. Two major factors that contribute to the

high intermediation cost, as measured by the interest spread

are poor credit mana-qement or hi-eh NPLs and high staff cost.

Other issues and challenges requiring attention are

the underdeveloped nature of the corporate bond market,

lower insurance penetration, the low de-eree of integration in

financial markets, and other market distortions such as those

caused by the taxation of some financial services. Though the

objective of taxing financial services is to enhance the

revenue of the government, due attention needs to be paid to

maintain uniform tax treatment across different matkets,

which may otherwise distort financial intermediation' In

addition, preparedness of the financial sector to face natural

disasters needs to be looked into in view of the recent

tsunami disaster.

1.4 Medium Term MacroeconomicFramework, lssues and Policies

G The tsunami disaster that struck in December 2004'

which caused massive damage to both human lives andproperty and brought on immense suffering to Sri

Lankans, changed the medium term macroeconomicoutlook of Sri Lanka with a substantial resource

requirements for RRR. The natural disaster has revealed

several facets in the development process of Sri Lanka that

require renewed recognition. The beneficial impact of

globalisation enablin-q the sharing of information, knowledge

and resources emerged as a fundamental factor that could

have minimised the massive destruction. Dealing with

disasters of such magnitudes require the collective efforts of

allstake holders, national and intemational, underscorin-e the

need fbr maintaining unity and goodwill among different

domestic as well as international se,uments of the population

and institutions. A serious need exists in strengthening

capacity in financial, technological and managerial spheres

to withstand and mana-qe disasters.l The MTMF presented with the Budget 2005, was

subsequently revised to accommodate RRR. Due to the

impact of the tsunami disaster on fisheries and tourism

sectors, the economic -erowth would sutfer in 2005, albeit

marginally. Increased rebuilding activities would compensate

to some extent for the loss of economic activities in fishing

and tourism. From 2006, onwards the growth is expected to

accelerate to over 6 per cent spreadin-e across all sectors and

geographic regions with the renewed emphasis on regional

development as well as the nation rebuilding programme of

the government. Consequently, unemployment will

gradually decline with the expected increase in economic

growth and concerted eftbrts by the -qovernment. National

savings will increase especially due to the expected

improvement in public savings. Investments, which would

respond positively to political and economic stability, will

increase, reflecting the benefits of incentives provided by the

BOI and the government.G Exports will continue to grow, benefiting from the global

economic expansion, and the preferential trade treatment

from the USA, the EU, India, and Pakistan, despite the

impact of the phasin-e out of the MFA. The pnvate sector

entrepreneurship complemented by government efforts in

promoting competitiveness of Sri Lanka and export led

development strategies will enable the achievement of a high

export growth.s Imports will also increase in the medium term at a higher

rate with the needs for RRR. However, the resulting increase

in the trade deficit in the medium telm will be financed

throu-eh concessional foreign assistance. The continuation of

the floatin-e exchange rate regime and increased inflows will

improve the balance of payments and hence the reserve

position, thus minimising pressure on the exchange rate'* Government expenditure will surge in the medium term

with additional expenses on RRR, which is expected to be

financed through foreign assistance without burdening

domestic resources. Thus, the fiscal consolidation envisa-ued

at the time of Bud-qet 2005 may not be significantly

threatened. The major pillars of such fiscalconsolidation are

the increased revenue, the rationalization of expenditure, and

the generation of a surplus in the current account ensurin-e

achievement of economic ,erowth above 6 per cent, while

reducing the inflation rate gradually but consistently from I I

per cent in early 2005 to 5 per cent by end 2008. Monetary

management will be facilitated by the expected decline in

credit to the government and public corporations.s There are several downside risks that would hinder theachievement of the targets in the MTMF. The most

disturbing risks are any delays in the inflow of anticipated

debt sustainability. The proposed fiscal consolidation

measures coupled with higher economic growth rates would

lead to an increase in public investment and lower the ratio

of debt to GDP in the medium term.I The monetary expansion will be reined in to bring inprice stability in the medium term. Monetary expansion is

expected to be contained at l5 per cent in 2005 and loweredgradually to 12.5 per cent by 2008 facilitatin-e the

fbreign assistance, any other adverse domestic or external

shocks, adverse developments in the peace process and

slippages in macroeconomic management. The govemment

has to speedily implement the rebuilding programme asplanned so that foreign funds could be disbursed asplanned to rebuild the nation, thereby increasing public

confidence. Any unexpected adverse domestic or external

shocks could disturb the growth momentum. Progress in

the peace process should continue to maintain a conduciveenvironment for developing confidence-and promotingeconomic activities. Slippages in macroeconomic

management could undermine the growth momentum,

external balance, fiscal consolidation and monetary stabilityleading to high inflation, low employment, and thevulnerability of the economy.

Achieving a better performance than outlined in theMTMF depends crucially on addressing severalimportant issues, which were repeatedly highJi-qhted in theprevious Central Bank Annual Reports, and facingeffectively the challenges posed by the tsunami disaster. In

this regard the government is in the process of developing

disaster management policies and strategies and developing

a national rebuilding programme throu_eh its operational armsof TAFREN and TAFOR. The government is also engagedin restorin-q permanent peace, maintaining continuouspolitical stability, maintaining law and order, improvingmacroeconomic mana_{ement, and improving economicgovernance. It is also imperative to develop an incentive

scheme for economic agents to succeed with their own

resources without government handouts, undertaking vitalstructural reforms, developing economic infrastructure

facilities, developing social intiastructure and human capitalthrough reforms in health, education and safety nets,

increasing productivity at all levels, promoting technology,promoting research and development, promoting further

acce ss to finance, ensuring greater equality in growthand income distribution, environmental protection for

sustainable development and eff'ectively integrating into the

process of globalisation.

Disaster management has become a priority with therealisation that Sri Lanka has been battered by bothnatural and man-made disasters, throughout the postIndependence era, with increasing frequency andintensity. Several civil wars and conflicts have beeninflicting a perrnanent damage to the country. Such disasters

have forced a significant brain drain out of SriLanka, thereby

denying the benefit of highly skilled human capital for the

advancement of the country. In every four years, a droughtcycle re-emerges with severe blows to agriculture, powergeneration, and all other power dependent economic

activities. The over-dependence on hydropower and hrgh cost

thermal power has generated a deep business cycle downturn

synchronised with the drought cycle. Droughts have usually

been fbllowed by floods, devastating most of the agriculture

areas. The latest tsunami disaster reveals that the notion ofrelative safety of Sri Lanka from earthquakes and seismicmovements generating tsunamis is no longer valid. Hence,national disaster avoidance and management strategiescovering the entire economy need to be formulated usingcomparative advantages of every private, public, non-governmental and international organization.

The improvement in macroeconomic management isessential to develop a conducive environment for marketsto operate effectively and the economy to remain stable

as discussed in the previous issue s of the Central BankAnnual Reports. Current areas of improvemenlare the

lowerin-e of public debt to a manageable level, containing theprimary deficit and current account dehcit and generating

surpluses needed for debt sustainability, containing excessivemonetary expansion, addressing the issue of emerging

negative real interest rates, and building up external reserves.

The required strong and sustainable fiscal adjustment process

is implied in the medium-term targets of the FMRA. Fiscalconsolidation paves the way for the monetary policy to

operate etfectively in containin-q monetary expansion aimedat maintainin,e price stability. The continuation of theflexible exchan-{e rate regime will avoid the build up of

destabilising forces.

It is necessary to undertake essential structural reformsurgently and simultaneously with the improvement inmacroeconomic management. Continuin_{ structuralreforms are required to raise the potential output of acountry by developing market based approaches, enablingthe redistribution of human, physical and financial

resources from less efficient sectors to those with highefficiency and greater social needs, while minimisingpotentially destabilising factors, that would negate thebenefits of reforms. Over the years, the Central BankAnnual Reports have identified a large number of areas

where structural reforms are needed, Reforms implementedsince 1977 with the liberalisation of the economy haveproven beneficial to operate a market based economicframework that generates a higher economic growth. Yet,

further scope for reforms exists in the areas of labour and

land markets, civil service, public enterprises, education,

health, pensions, welfare and safety nets, financial sector,

the judicial process and the regulatory system. In 2004,

the -eovernment attempted several such reforms using the

modality of SEMA.

Reforms should address the removal of inefficiencies ininfrastructure facilities adequately to support growth,

while ensuring that such facilities are made available at

24Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2004

Part lchapter 1 - EcoNoMtc PERFoRMANCE, OUTLOOKAND pOLtCtES

internationally comparable prices. A series of reformswould be necessary to develop economic and socialinfrastructure, essential fbr continuation of economicgrowth, generation of a series of tradable services and

supporling poverty alleviation. The present serious supply

shorta-aes and regional disparities in roads, electricity,telecommunications, transportation and water supply

sectors as well as in health and education facilities haveconstrained the growth. Pricing of services withoutcovering at least the cost of production render the major

institutions providing infrastructure facilities to depend onbudgetary support from the government. Independentregulatory mechanisms are Iacking in many sectors and theexisting mechanisms are weak or ineffective. Health care

is saddled with labour disputes, insufficient investment, andimproper targeting. Education displays serious mismatcheswith market needs, and has not been able to generate andretain the required human capital needed for rapideconomic development.

The continuing growth in many countries beyond thegrowth achieved through increased factor accumulationarises from technology improvement shaped byresearch and development. Sri Lanka needs to facilitateboth technology improvements and research and

development activities to achieve sustainable growth.

Sustainable growth has to be environment friendly, andthe environment protection policies should not be an

obstacle to growth. The protection of the environment and

a sustainable economic growth should be promoted using

a well-designed and coordinated policy framework.

The continuing income inequality could generate publicagitation, if opportunities are not provided by addressingthe above issues. The regional inequality is a naturalphenomenon where economic activities are concentratedaround higher social and economic infrastructure,benefiting from positive externalities of various mutuallybeneficial economic activities. In a country without anyinternal trade and investment barriers, geographicinequality calls for attention if there are any hindranceslimiting the extent of economic activities, and if there is adeficiency in the supply of growth supporting public goods

and public investment. Therefbre, relevant public goods andpublic investment have to be provided to createopportunities for all.

Enhancing access to finance by all sectors in theeconomy, especially SMEs, is necessary to furtherpromote their contribution to the economy, and reduce

re-eional income disparity. A si_enificant policy initiativetorvards fulfillin_e this objective has been taken by setting

up of a specialised bank to cater to SMEs,

G Countries with a growth potential make special attempts

to be ranked high in international comparisons in humandevelopment, competitiveness, economic freedom, andtransparency to attract further investment. Making aneftbrt to be ranked high could be a self-generated incentive

for fbcusing efforts in a country to achieve the goal of growth

and development. A recent publication by the World Bankand ADB has stated that Sri Lanka stands out among

countties in the region for its good governance, and that firms

benefit from the low levels of red tape and com.rption.i Sri Lanka has to consolidate its achievements whilefacing immediate challenges, The internationally

recognized achievements in governance should be further

improved. Productive use of government expenditure and

repositionin-e of the government sector delivery mechanismto reach all sectors of the economy has to be ensured byphasing out wasteful subsidies, which have hindered

productive public investment. Fiscal revenue needs to beincreased leading to fiscal surpluses, thereby providingflexibility to both fiscal and monetary policies in combating

sectoral imbalances and promoting economic stability and

long-run economic growth.r The tsunami disaster has underscored the importance ofbeing a member of the global family, be it for sharinginformation and technology, developing economicpartnerships or for international financial assistance.

Expanding Sri Lanka's economic territory should continuefacilitatin_e the enlargement of its market and increase

economic opportunities for Sri Lankans. Globalisation paves

the way for Sri Lanka to expand its export market, whileimproving efficiency of factors of production through

international relations. With expanding and changing humandemands, it is costly, if not impossible, for a country to

become self sufficient in all of its needs. The effective

integration into the process of globalisation would enable thecountry to concentrate on producing goods and services inwhich it has a comparative advantage and maximise benefits

by trading them with the rest of the world, thereby improving

the welfare of the people. Thus, a high economic growth has

to be equitable, regionally balanced, environment friendly

and integrated with the ongoing globalisation process to be

sustainable in the medium and long-term.o Sri Lanka has to grapple with immediate challengesposed by the current high international oil prices andthe tsunami disaster while focusing on medium termissues. With the increasing thermal power generation in

the absence of other alternate energy sources, the country's

dependency on imports of oil has increased over the years.High oil prices, while exerting significant pressures on theBOP, the exchange rate and inflation, further weakened

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2OO425

Part IChapter 1 - ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

the financial position of the CEB and CPC. The inevitable

increases in subsidy payments add to the fiscal burden,

unless appropriate price adjustments are made to ensure

economy on consumption. Therefore, the country's abilityto withstand pressure from hi-eh oil prices should be

enhanced by adoptin-q appropriate policies within the

macroeconomic lramework, developing alternative energy

sources, minimizing inefficient usage of fuel, restructuring

energy related public institutions and phasin-q out wasteful

subsidies associated with hi,eh oil prices. In this regard,

both CEB and CPC need restructuring on a priority basis.The CEB should gain capability of meeting the future

electricity demand of the country, fbr otherwise, the high

growth expectations in the medium to long run would be

impeded by frequent black outs and brown outs. Similarly,

the CPC should reduce its mounting debt obligations tothe banking system by prudentially and rationally

managing its assets structure. All stake holders should

realise the need for the restructuring process and examine

the issues more objectively.a The tsunami devastation poses new challenges, while

reconstruction offers new opportunities. However, it is

important to ensure that the RRR will not become a fiscal

burden undermining the on going fiscal reform towardsreducing debt financing in the National Budget.

Similarly, additional cunent expenditure should not lead toa reduction in much needed investment expenditure.The efficient utilization of foreign assistance forreconstruction and rehabilitation without disturbing themacroeconomic stability and on -eoing developmentprocesses in the other parts of the country requires a

si-enificant improvement in the absorption capacity. It is alsoimportant to ensure that domestic economic imbalances

arising from large inflows of foreign aid are appropriately

addressed while also taking steps to accelerate the rate ofutilisation of foreign aid.$ Finally, to further consolidate its achievements and topropel the economy on to a higher growth path, thegovernment has to increase the provision of public goods

and services, while providing a conducive environmentfor the private sector to unleash its creative energy. Since

this process has already begun, the private sector too needs

to take its own initiatives to support the growth process bytaking steps to expand the production frontier through

i ncreasin g producti vi ty, continuously en,{aging i n rese arch

and development, and facing the challenges of globalisation

while reaping benefits from it. Such a dynamic private sectorwill drive the economy forward while creating employment,reducing poverty and providing opportunities for all

Sri Lankans.
