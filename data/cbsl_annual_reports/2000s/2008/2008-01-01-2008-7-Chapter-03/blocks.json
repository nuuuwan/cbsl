The continuous budgetary support for infrastructure development, despite \ufb01 scal constraints, is laudable, while more efforts to catalyse greater private \ufb01 nancing through Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) are needed to supplement government investments and for a sustained development of infrastructure. Consistent policy, good governance and transparency, institutional capacity building, effective regulations and ef\ufb01 cient \ufb01 nancial markets are pre-requisites in promoting private investments in both economic and social infrastructure projects.",

A rapid growth was seen in the telecommunications industry with the continuous adoption of improved technology, higher competition, increased capacity and coverage as well as conducive policies. Port services grew at a healthy rate, particularly during the first three quarters, bene\ufb01 tting from increased trade and productivity improvements. Energy sector continued to suffer from historically high oil prices in 2008. The electricity sector, which heavily depends on thermal power was badly affected by high oil prices. However, the reduction of oil prices in the international markets from mid-July, 2008 mitigated the impact of high oil prices to some extent on the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), but could not take the CEB completely out of its tough \ufb01 nancial constraints. The adjustment of domestic petroleum prices to reflect high international prices, instead of subsidizing, helped to reduce the subsidy burden on the government budget. Adjustments of prices in the transport, petroleum and power sectors in response to rising costs mainly due to high oil prices and, thereby, reducing unproductive direct and indirect subsidies were policy measures taken in the right direction in achieving macroeconomic stability. The passenger transportation registered a moderate growth in 2008. The civil aviation sector, which was badly affected by high fuel prices in the \ufb01 rst half and downturn in the tourism industry, registered a negative growth in 2008. Some policy initiatives have been taken to improve the education sector specially the tertiary education while, the health sector continued its efforts to achieve the goals identi\ufb01 ed in the Health Master Plan.",

The subscriber network of the telecommunications sector grew by 35.5 per cent in 2008, following the 47 per cent growth in 2007. Fixed access telephone connections expanded by 25.7 per cent during the period, largely due to an expansion of the wireless network with Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology, which along with Global System Mobile (GSM) technology helped people in rural areas to have easy connections. The mobile telephone network increased by 38.8 per cent in 2008, compared to the previous year. The mobile telephone penetration (mobile connections as a per cent of total population) increased signi\ufb01 cantly to 54.8 per cent in 2008 from 39.9 per cent in 2007 surpassing the level of penetration in other countries in the region. With these developments, the telephone density (telephones per 100 persons), including cellular phones, increased to 71.9 in 2008 from 53.6 in 2007. By end 2008, the telecommunications sector consisted of 4 \ufb01 xed line operators, 4 mobile operators, 33 external gateway operators and 22 internet service providers.

The \ufb01 rst phase (200 MW) of the Kerawalapitiya combined cycle power plant with a capacity of 300 MW was completed in November, 2008 and added to the national grid, while the remaining 100 MW is expected to be added to the national grid in 2009. The Norochcholai coal power plant (900 MW) which was started in 2007 is expected to add 300 MW to the national grid in the \ufb01 rst stage by 2011 and 600 MW in the second and third stages. The cost of power generation from coal \ufb01 red power plants is relatively low compared to oil \ufb01 red power plants, which may result in reducing the overall cost of power generation. Meanwhile, the construction work of the Upper Kothmale hydropower plant was in progress in 2008 and is expected to add 150 MW to the national grid by 2011. Negotiations were also in progress with foreign investors to set up a coal power plant with a capacity of 1,000 MW in Trincomalee. In addition, four medium scale hydropower plants namely, Uma Oya (120 MW), Ginganga (49 MW), Broadland (35 MW) and Morogolla (27 MW) have been identi\ufb01 ed for implementation. These power plants, once completed, would provide a space for the country to rationalize its power generation mix, thereby helping the country to cope with internal and external shocks and maintain the stability in the power system.",

In addition, VAT on petrol was increased to 12 per cent from January, 2009 and the full duty wavier of Rs. 20.00 per litre on importation of petrol was suspended in May 2008.

This principle simply enunciates that buyers of a transaction should take the requisite measures to protect themselves and the sellers have no responsibility for the losses incurred by buyers. When applied to a hedging product, it means that the buyer should learn of the risks involved and enter into the transaction with full knowledge. The principle holds even if the sellers have deliberately and intentionally misled the buyers into accepting a product that would bring them potential losses. However, the application of this legal principle for the derivative transactions has been withheld by courts in the wake of a plethora of cases in which the buyers in derivative transactions had incurred substantial losses persistently. That was after the issuers of hedging products, mainly investment banks, were accused of \u2018mis-selling\u2019 or \u2018mis-labelling\u2019 of products to the detriment of the buyers.",

The principle of suitability casts upon the seller the responsibility of ascertaining the appropriateness of the buyer of a product before entering into a formal deal with him. Since many financial products and derivatives are complex in nature, not all buyers could adequately assess the risks they are taking when buying such products. In view of the fact that such derivative products are of high value, the resultant losses to buyers could also be substantial. Hence, it is the responsibility of the seller to make the buyer \u2018suitable\u2019 to enter into a deal with him. In other words, the two parties to a derivative transaction should be well-informed of the risks faced by each other and participate in the deal as equal partners. Bringing up the buyer to that status is the responsibility of the seller. Thus, the principle of suitability precludes the seller from \u2018unjustly enriching himself out of the ignorance of the buyer\u2019.",

That is because of the existence of a crucial problem called \u2018information asymmetry\u2019 in markets. In the case of hedging deals, the seller may be well equipped with knowledge, but the buyer needs to be educated. The disparity in the knowledge of the two parties would elevate the seller to a superior position, thereby enabling him to get himself enriched unduly. When the buyers became victims of this information asymmetry, the hedging markets on their own devised a code of good practices to minimise its occurrence. In markets where there is no such market developed code for hedging transactions, it is the responsibility of the regulators to introduce a mandatory code of best practices to ensure fair deals in the derivative markets.",

These directions, among other things, speci\ufb01 cally required the banks or authorized dealers to educate the clients of the pros and cons and the risks involved in hedging deals. According to the directions, \u201cauthorized dealers shall obtain an undertaking from the customers interested in using the derivative products that they have clearly understood the nature of the products and their inherent risk\u201d, and \u201cauthorized dealers shall provide adequate information on the transaction especially with regard to the conditions and clauses to be incorporated into the product-determined benchmark interest rate, strike price, premia if any and risks involved to their customers and ensure highest level of transparency\u201d. In terms of a set of guidelines issued in 2007, in the case of corporate customers, the bank that proposes the hedging deal should inform all the board members of the nature and the level of the risks involved in the proposed hedging and get a signed acknowledgement from the board to that effect. In this manner, the corporate client who is to sign the hedging agreement with the bank would do so as an equal partner fully aware of the risks involved. It is mandatory for banks in Sri Lanka to follow these directions. If the banks fail to comply with the directions, the hedging contracts involved will become \u2018tainted and materially defective\u2019. In such a situation, courts may discharge the buyers from the responsibility for honouring the hedging contracts. Hence, the appropriate dictum in the",

Mihin Air, the second national carrier and a budget airline suspended its operations from May, 2008 and re-commenced operations from January, 2009 with government budgetary allocations to meet its capital requirements. While it is important to have a budget airline, it is necessary to maintain its operations in a commercially viable manner. In this regard, it is important that the budget airline should put in place a medium-term business plan taking into account, the global trends in air traf\ufb01 c, cost cutting experiences of other budget airline operations and the high cost of acquiring aircraft for operations.

Pollution of water sources by industrial ef\ufb02 uents and other human activities such as improper waste water disposal, solid waste dumps and use of agro chemicals, purifying water has become costly. As water is a scarce resource, unaccounted water at around 31 per cent at distribution level, has been a chronic issue in the water sector.

Sri Lanka is currently experiencing a demographic and epidemiological transition and hence, unless it is prepared in advance to face the challenges this would be a heavy burden on the health sector in the future. Though, Sri Lanka has succeeded in combating the traditional communicable diseases such as malaria, leprosies, new challenges have emerged with rising non-communicable diseases such as strokes, kidney failures, diabeties, mental illness and accident injuries and new communicable diseases such as dengue, HIV/AIDS etc. The ageing population and the increase of non-communicable diseases also highlight the need for diverting an increased level of resources to these sectors in the coming years.",
