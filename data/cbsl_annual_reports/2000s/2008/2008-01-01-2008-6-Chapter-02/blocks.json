    "text": "The rubber production recorded a substantial increase of 10 per cent to reach 129 million kg in 2008. Though the production was continuously affected by the torrential rainfall that prevailed in the \ufb01 rst half of the year, rubber production continued to increase in the midst of rise in demand for natural rubber due to escalating synthetic rubber prices and the extraordinary high prices that were recorded for natural rubber during this period. Accordingly, in June 2008, the prices of Ribbed Smoked Sheet (RSS) rubber was marked around Rs. 350 per kg which is considered to be the highest ever price recorded at the Colombo Rubber Auctions. However, rubber prices started to fall in the second half as the demand for natural rubber started to decline in the midst of the melt down of world demand for rubber due to the global \ufb01 nancial crisis and with falling oil prices leading to the shift in demand towards synthetic rubber. Consequently, the increased average prices of RSS No. 1 and No. 2 by 33 per cent and 34 per cent, respectively in the first half, underwent a turnaround and recorded a drop of 19 per cent on both these varieties in the second half compared to \ufb01 rst half of the year, thereby affecting the short to medium term sustainability of the industry.",

These included the implementation of a support scheme to ensure that the rubber product manufacturers are able to purchase rubber latex from the growers at least at Rs. 150 per kg, increase of the Cess to Rs. 25 per kg on imported natural rubber latex and other rubber products, and increase of the Cess on imported synthetic rubber to Rs.35 per kg to enhance the demand for domestic rubber latex. Further, measures such as suspension of the export Cess collected from the domestic rubber manufacturing industries for a period of one year, the suspension of the 15 per cent surcharge on electricity, the reduction of the price of furnace oil by Rs. 10 per litre to reduce the cost of production, and the targeted provision of \ufb01 nancial assistance to local industrialists to encourage the manufacturing of tyres for buses and other vehicles which are currently imported, were introduced.",

The Rubber Development Department (RDD) has initiated several programs in 2008 to improve the productivity. The RDD, with the assistance of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), implemented a special project to expand rubber cultivation in the Monaragala District. Further, during the year, RDD trained 2,640 rubber latex harvestors in Kalutara and Kegalle Districts with the assistance of the Rubber Research Institute (RRI) and the Vocational Training Authority (VTA). 30 bud grafters were also trained in the Kalutara District in augment the dearth of skilled latex harvestors and bud grafters in the industry. The RRI also unfolded their plans together with their \ufb01 ndings towards the improvement of the rubber industry, which included a recommendation of introducing a \u201cMucuna Bracteata\u201d cover crop to substitute the 50 per cent of Nitrogen fertiliser requirement for the 6 year immature period and thereby cut down Nitrogen fertiliser cost by Rs. 31,300 per hectare of rubber land and also the application of 2,500 metric tons of paddy straw for a hectare of rubber land during the 6 year immature period and thereby reduce Potassium fertiliser cost by Rs. 31,700 per hectare of rubber land.",

Further, this study revealed that the productivity of coconut estates increases as the land size increases from 21 acres onwards up to 40 acres. During the year, CRI contributed in controlling the spread of WCLWD by demarcating 3 km wide and 240 km long disease free boundary along Galle to Tangalle road and by prohibiting the transportation of coconut and other palm seedlings and their fresh parts out of the diseased areas. Further, improved hybrid varieties such as CRISL-98 and Kapruwana seedlings were issued to coconut growers by CRI during the year.",

The production of cocoa increased by 87 per cent, cloves by 169 per cent, arecanuts by 14 per cent and the coffee by 2 per cent. During the year, the production of betel declined by 7 per cent, cardamom by 21 per cent, pepper by 21 per cent and cinnamon by 3.5 per cent and cashew by 57 per cent. The decline of the production of cinnamon was attributed to the decline of world demand, especially in Mexico which purchases about 40 per cent of Sri Lankan cinnamon and other Latin American countries, in the face of the impact of the global \ufb01 nancial crisis on these countries. Accordingly, cinnamon prices dropped in the range of 30 to 40 per cent per kg during the third quarter of the year. Apart from the reduced export demand, decline in production of pepper was affected by heavy and continuous rainfall in major pepper growing areas such as Kandy and Matale. The imposition of certain restrictions by India on the import of pepper from Sri Lanka under India Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISFTA) also contributed to the decline in exports of pepper, thereby reducing pepper production. Nevertheless, clove harvest showed an exceptional performance in 2008 owing to the reason that cloves production hits a boom harvest in every four years and the year 2004 had been its last boom harvest. To address the problems faced by the cinnamon producers, several measures were announced through the government\u2019s Economic Stimulus package that was introduced in December 2008. These included the granting of loans for working capital requirements of growers at competitive rates, and the introduction of a special incentive scheme under the SLEDB for cinnamon exporters who purchase cinnamon at guaranteed prices from the cinnamon cultivators.",

This increase was all the more outstanding since it was recorded in the Yala season, which normally records a relatively lower production. This increase was largely attributable to the 62 per cent increase of the extent of land cultivated, when compared to the previous Yala season, arising mainly from the 24 per cent increase of government\u2019s minimum purchasing price of paddy from the producers as against previous minimum prices. This move was supplemented by factors such as the continuation of the government fertiliser support scheme, amidst the high fertiliser prices in the world, and the more favourable rainfall in 2008 in almost all parts of the country. The increase of lands under cultivation in the districts of Ampara, Baticaola and Trincomalee, which together contributed to 23 per cent of the total paddy production in the Yala season, also attributed to this trend. The higher prices of cereals, including wheat, that prevailed in the world market, especially in the \ufb01 rst half of 2008, also served as an incentive for the increase in rice production. Further, the successful implementation of the government\u2019s agricultural program, viz., \u201cApi Wawamu - Rata Nagamu\u201d contributed to the increase of the extent and methodology of cultivation, thereby contributing to the increased production.",

Of the increase in the marine sub-sector, the most notable growth was recorded in off shore/deep sea \ufb01 sh production with a 6.6 per cent rise due to the encouragement of \ufb01 shers on off shore \ufb01 shing operations through providing of information on \ufb01 shing grounds, and the increase of \ufb01 shing operations in the East coast. The coastal production indicated a higher increase of 10.1 per cent due to favourable weather condition as well as increase of \ufb01 shing in the East due to the quick resettlement of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). The inland water fish production showed an increase of around 23 per cent and seasonal tank production achieved a 10.9 per cent increase, mainly due to proper management of the water bodies with community participatory programmes and increasing \ufb01 ngerlings stockings. The increasing trend in the market prices of \ufb01 sh, which prevailed in the \ufb01 rst half of 2008 mainly due to shortage in supply in the face of increasing cost due to high oil prices, started to decline in the second half of the year with the increased supply due to improved \ufb01 shing operations in the Eastern Province. Meanwhile, the shrimp farming industry showed a 38 per cent decline in production mainly due to White Spot Disease. The high maintenance cost of water treatment with chlorine for disinfections and higher fuel cost also affected the prawn farming industry.",

Accordingly, the construction of three new fishery harbours at Hambantota, Ambalangoda and Chilaw were completed. The preliminary work such as land acquisition, possession of the land, and signing of the financing agreement related to Dikkowita Fishery Harbour was completed. Once completed, the Dikkowita harbour will be the largest fully equipped harbour with landing, mooring and shore based facilities to cater to the needs of deep sea \ufb01 shing vessels which can gain more access to foreign vessels, thereby leading to new opportunities for the growth of the tuna \ufb01 shing industry. Construction of the \ufb01 sh market complex at Peliyagoda was commenced at the end of the year. This new market complex will facilitate the handling of 500 metric tons of \ufb01 sh per day, with adequate facilities for wholesale and retail trade and distribution of \ufb01 sh under modern standards. Under the ice plants and clod chain development program, 11 containerised ice plants with 10 metric tons of daily production capacity were established and production was commenced in 2008. In addition, 12 containerised cold rooms with the capacity of 10 metric tons were established. Further, a Satellite based \ufb01 shery forecasting system was in progress, targeting to identify potential \ufb01 shing zones for multi-",

This slower growth was mainly due to the decelerated demand in export markets driven by economic downturns mainly in the USA and the EU, and high competition from low cost producing countries amidst domestic cost pressures. With the intensi\ufb01 cation of the global crisis, there have been requests for price reductions and major buyers have been cautious in con\ufb01 rming forward orders. In this environment, even the major players of the apparel industry have moved to merge their operations and reduce overtime costs and wage bills in order to remain competitive in the industry. The uncertainty in the EU market somewhat eased, owing to the retention of the GSP+ duty concession for a further three years from 2009.",

In order to encourage the utilisation of local raw rubber in rubber based manufacturing industries, a Cess of Rs. 25 / kg was imposed on imported latex rubber. To encourage local maize producers, a Cess of 25 per cent was imposed on imported maize and animal feed applicable to all importers including those in the BOI enterprises. Further, a 5 per cent Cess was imposed on paper imports to encourage domestic paper products by making commercially viable the products of two paper factories in Embilipitiya and Valaichenai which have been modernised. A 15 per cent Cess on furniture imports and a Cess of Rs. 200 / kg on imported leather products were also imposed in order to facilitate domestic industries. Further, to facilitate the ceramic-ware industry, confectionery industry and domestic electrical goods manufacturing industries such as fridges and fans, the Cess on such industrial imports was increased by 50 per cent. Meanwhile, initiatives have been taken to implement regulatory standards on confectionery items to ensure that they do not contain melamine. A Cess of Rs. 10/kg has been imposed on imported salt to promote local salt production to reach self-suf\ufb01 ciency.",

This contraction was a direct result of the drop in tourist arrivals by 11.2 per cent due to security conditions that prevailed in the country and the worldwide contraction of travel and leisure activities since September 2008, consequent to the global economic crisis. As a result, tourist arrivals from Western Europe and the Asian region, which usually accounts for around 78 per cent, fell by around 14.0 per cent. A decline in domestic tourism activities was also witnessed.",

The Northern and the Eastern provinces have scored the lowest, mainly due to the under-performance shown by these two provinces in the Economy and the Business Climate sub-index. Welfare measures widely introduced by the government particularly in the areas of health and education, have reduced the disparities among provinces in the sub-index Well-being of the People. In these areas, it is well known that the achievements of Sri Lanka are well comparable among its peers. What is important in using the index scores is comprehensive analysis of the results of all the sub-indices and the composite index to identify necessary policy interventions and priorities and take appropriate measures relevant to each province to further their prosperity in relation to their previous vertical as well as horizontal positions in the SLPI.",
