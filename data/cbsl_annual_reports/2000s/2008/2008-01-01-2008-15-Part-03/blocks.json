These advertisements are very misleading and cause much negativemisinterpretation of the economic situation of the country. There have been complaints from the public about being misledby these advertisements too. Whilst we understand that good marketing strategies are necessary in a competitive market,we wish to emphasise that they should be ethical, with clear policies.Therefore, we hereby request all the licensed banks to refrain from publishing misleading and unethical advertisementswith immediate effect and to ensure that all important information is highlighted in a visible manner to enable the generalpublic to understand clearly the nature of the products and the effective interest rates applicable.",
