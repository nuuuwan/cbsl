Meanwhile, the policy of re-opening the existing Treasury bond series was continued thereby limiting the introduction of new bond series to the market to address the high fragmentation of the domestic debt market and to reduce the complexity in the issuance of Treasury bonds.

The fragility of the \ufb01 nancial position of the CEB was manifested in its accumulated short-term borrowings from banks, outstanding liabilities to the CPC and to Independent Power Producers (IPPs), and government continued to service CEB\u2019s long-term loans having a direct impact on the budget.

The termination of the payment in lieu of leave not availed by public of\ufb01 cers with effect from January 2008 reduced the burden to a certain extent. Meanwhile, the share of salaries and wages in the total recurrent expenditure declined to 32.1 per cent compared with 34.4 per cent recorded in 2007. The increase in pension payments by 9 per cent was mainly due to the increase in COLA to pensioners and the impact of the entry of 4,783 new pensioners in 2008. The interest payments increased by 16 per cent to Rs. 212.5 billion mainly due to the high domestic interest rates. The defence expenditure, including the salaries and wages to defence personnel, showed a considerable increase mainly due to the new recruitments to the armed forces, increase in fuel expenditure and the expenditure on other goods and services related to defence activities.",

This increase was mainly due to the continuation of several major infrastructure development projects as well as provincial and rural infrastructure developments through Gama Neguma (Village Development), Maga Neguma (Road Development), Gami Diriya, Southern Province Rural Economic Advancement Project (Southern REAP), rehabilitation of minor irrigation projects and projects implemented by Provincial Councils. However, the performance was considerably below the expectations mainly due to the lower in\ufb02 ow of foreign \ufb01 nancing and the shortfall in the government revenue, which necessitated the prioritisation of the projects and the disbursement of funds. Nevertheless, the public investment as a per cent of GDP was maintained at 6.0 per cent, which was below the 6.4 per cent recorded in the previous year.",

Meanwhile, public investment in social services increased by 9.5 per cent from Rs. 55 billion to Rs.60 billion giving high priority to health and education sectors with a view of promoting human resource base in the country. Accordingly, the investment in education was directed towards upgrading infrastructure, eradicating inequality among primary schools and developing IT knowledge among students. Public investment in the health sector was mainly directed towards improving access to health care, focusing vulnerable people, particularly in the lagging regions, through improvement of estate hospitals, while developing health infrastructure and facilities.",

Maintaining public investment at this level is appreciable given the various \ufb01 scal constraints and the thin \ufb01 scal space available to the government. However, in order to sustain the growth momentum and supplement and facilitate private investments and reach the desired level of economic growth, public investment needs to be increased further. It is encouraging that during the period 2006-2008, the public investment in economic services has signi\ufb01 cantly increased, especially in the transport sector. Investments in energy and water supply sectors recorded the highest increase, while the investment in education also recorded a considerable growth. Of the total public investment, the inve stment in regional development through Provincial Councils has also increased since 2005 by 77.6 per cent to Rs. 24.6 billion in 2008.",

The global \ufb01 nancial crisis, which was intensi\ufb01 ed during the later part of the year, resulted in a net out\ufb02 ow of foreign investments in Treasury bills and Treasury bonds and did not permit the government to mobilise expected foreign commercial borrowings. These reasons, coupled with the increased borrowing requirement due to lower revenue collection and overrun in the recurrent expenditure, necessitated the government to shift the borrowing programme more towards domestic \ufb01 nancing. In addition, the relatively slow progress in the public investment programme due to the prioritisation of projects as a result of the lack of counterpart funds also affected the deceleration of the disbursement of foreign concessional financing. Accordingly, total gross foreign concessional borrowings amounted only to Rs. 98.5 billion compared to Rs. 137 billion in 2007. Gross foreign commercial borrowings amounted only to Rs. 16.2 billion (US dollars 150 million). During the year, the out\ufb02 ows of foreign investment in Treasury bonds amounted to Rs. 32.5 billion (US dollars 300.5 million). Meanwhile, the amount of foreign grants received in 2008 continued to be relatively high at Rs. 30.3 billion (US dollars 280 million) despite the stressed international \ufb01 nancial conditions.",

Under the FMRA, the debt to GDP ratio has to be reduced to 60 per cent by 2013. The fiscal performance in 2009 in the midst of global \ufb01 nancial crisis is likely to experience lower than planned amount of foreign borrowings due to the tight liquidity conditions in the international \ufb01 nancial markets. Hence, in facing the challenges emanating from the \ufb01 nancial crisis, efforts have to be made to avoid signi\ufb01 cant undue deviations in the recurrent expenditure, budget de\ufb01 cit and borrowings. Once the pressures of the \ufb01 nancial crisis are eased, it is necessary to switch into the normal \ufb01 scal consolidation path, which has already been announced by the government in its policy documents. In addition, being an emerging middle income country, Sri Lanka will have to face the challenge of accessing foreign concessional loans in the years to come. Therefore, there is a need to promote alternative project \ufb01 nancing methods, such as Public Private Partnerships (PPPs), to reduce the burden on the government budget.",
