1.1Accountability and the Financial Performanceof the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in relation tothe Objectives.

The Central Bank was established as the authorityresponsible for the administration, supervision andregulation of the monetary, financial and paymentsystems of Sri Lanka under the Monetary Law Act.In accordance with this Act, the Bank is chargedwith the responsibility of securing the coreobjectives of economic and price stability andfinancial system stability.

The basis of accountability for the Central Bankand the success of its operations therefore wouldbe the effectiveness of its policies and operationsleading towards the achievement of its coreobjectives and not necessarily its profitability perse. These statutory objectives are the fundamentalfeatures that distinguish the Central Bank from anyother entity, private or public. Accordingly,profitability related approach, if adopted by theCentral Bank, could result in the Bank pursuingprofits while compromising its core objectives,since it has the unique ability to create its ownprofits through its monetary policy activities, whichcould influence interest rates and exchange rates.It therefore follows that the Central Bank’sobjectives of economic and price stability andfinancial system stability need to be distinguishedand detached from the pure profitability objectivewhich should essentially be incidental or academiconly.

In this background, the Central Bank’s financialstatements record results in the implementation ofits monetary policy operations, exchange ratemanagement, issuing of currency, etc. at the valuesas realized and hence, the financial performance asreported in these statements needs to be interpretedand understood in that context.

1.2Reporting Entities and Statutory Base

These are the financial statements of the CentralBank of Sri Lanka (“Bank” or “CBSL”), theinstitution established under the Monetary Law ActNo 58 of 1949 of Sri Lanka as amended (“MLA”),as the authority responsible for the administrationsupervision and regulation of monetary, financialand payment system of Sri Lanka. Central Bank ofSri Lanka is domiciled in the Democratic SocialistRepublic of Sri Lanka and situated at No: 30,Janadhipathi Mawatha, Colombo 01.

These financial statements were authorised for issueby the Governor and Chief Accountant on 6th March2009.

1.3Accounting Policies

1.3.1Basis of preparation

The financial Statements are prepared on thehistorical cost basis, except for land & building andcertain financial assets that have been measured atfair value as identified in specific accountingpolicies below.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report 2008

Part II

Reporting Format

The Bank presents financial assets and financialliabilities, and their associated income and expensestreams, by distinguishing between foreign currencyand local currency activities. In the balance sheet,assets & liabilities are presented broadly in orderof liquidity within such distinguished category. TheBank considers that this reporting approach provideappropriate reporting of the Bank’s activities whichare more fully described in Note 1.5.

Statement of Compliance

These financial statements of Central Bank of SriLanka for the year ended 31 December 2008 havebeen prepared in accordance with InternationalFinancial Reporting Standard (IFRS).The financialstatements prepared in accordance with theMonetary Law Act (MLA) are audited by theAuditor General and gazetted as required by the law.Due to certain requirements in the IFRS, theclassifications, and hence the numbers, in thegazetted financial statements, would be differentfrom those in these financial statements.

Currency of Presentation

All amounts in Sri Lanka Rupees are expressed inthousands, unless otherwise stated.

1.3.2Significant Accounting Judgments and Estimates

In the process of applying the accounting policies,the Bank has made the following judgments apartfrom those involving estimations, which have themost significant effect on the amounts recognizedin the financial statements.

Impairment of Available for Sale Investments

The Bank determines that Available for SaleInvestments are impaired when there has been asignificant or prolonged decline in the fair valuebelow its cost. This determination of what issignificant or prolonged requires judgment.

Pensions and Other Post Employment BenefitPlans

The cost of defined benefit plans is determined usingan actuarial valuation. The actuarial valuationinvolves making assumptions about discount rates,expected rates of return on assets, futurecompensation increases, mortality rates and futurepension increases. Due to the long-term nature ofthese plans, such estimates are subject to significantuncertainty.

1.3.3Adoption of Amended IFRS during the year

The accounting policies adopted are consistent withthose used in the previous year.

1.3.3.1 Standards, interpretations and amendments topublished standards that are not yet effective

Certain new standards, amendments andinterpretations to existing standards have beenpublished that are applicable for the Bank’saccounting periods beginning on or after 1 January2009 or later periods but which the Bank has notearly adopted, as follows:

IFRS 8, Operating Segments (effective from 1January 2009) – IFRS 8 specifies how an entityshould report information about its operatingsegments in annual financial statements. The Bankis in the process of assessing the impact of IFRS 8and its voluntary application.

1.4Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

1.4.1Foreign Currency Conversions

Bank’s functional and presentation currency is SriLanka Rupees (Rs). Transactions in foreigncurrencies are initially recorded in the functionalcurrency ruling at the date of transaction. Monetaryassets and liabilities denominated in foreigncurrencies are retranslated at the rate of exchangeruling at the balance sheet date. All differences aretaken to the Income Statement. For the purposes ofretranslation the following Sri Lanka rupeeexchange rates for major currencies were used:

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms ofhistorical cost in a foreign currency are translatedusing exchange rates at the dates of initialtransactions.

1.4.2Financial Assets and Liabilities

The Bank presents financial assets and liabilities,and the associated income and expense streams, bydistinguishing between foreign currency and localcurrency activities. Foreign currency activitiesmainly arise from the Bank’s foreign reservesmanagement function. Local currency activitiesmainly reflect the assets and liabilities associatedwith monetary policy implementation, issuingcurrency and banking activities.

The separate reporting of these activities isconsidered to provide a better presentation of theBank’s financial position, financial performance andrisk profile. The Bank considers that the combinedreporting of foreign and local currency activitieswould weaken the informational value of thefinancial statements.

All financial assets are initially recognised at cost,being the fair value of the consideration given andincluding acquisition charges associated with the

investment. Subsequent measurement bases afterinitial recognition are described below. All regularway purchases and sales of financial assets arerecognised on the trade date respectively. Regularway purchases or sales are purchases or sales offinancial assets that require delivery of assets withinthe time frame generally established by regulationor convention in the market place.

Securities at Fair Value through Profit or Loss

Financial assets classified as held for trading areincluded in the category securities at fair valuethrough profit or loss. These securities aresubsequently valued at quoted market prices.Changes in market value are recognised as anincrease or decrease in the value of the securities inthe Balance Sheet while resulting gains and lossesare recognised in the Income Statement.Where the security is still owned, the gain or loss isreported as Gain /(Loss) from Unrealised PriceRevaluations. Where the gain or loss has beenrealised (through selling the security), this isreported as Gain /(Loss) Realised from PriceChanges.Foreign Currency Available-for-Sale InvestmentsForeign currency available for sale investments aresubsequently valued at quoted market prices.Changes in market value are recognised as anincrease or decrease in the value of the availablefor sale securities in the Balance Sheet underreserves.Gains and losses arising from changes in the marketvalue of foreign currency available-for-saleinvestments are recognised on a separate componentof equity (shown under Other Reserves in theBalance Sheet) until the investment is sold, collectedor otherwise disposed of, or until the investment isdetermined to be impaired, at which time thecumulative gain or loss previously reported as equityis included in income.GoldSection 67 (1) of the Monetary Law Act whichspecifies the composition of the InternationalReserve indicates that gold may be held by the

CBSL as part of this Reserve. Hence, CBSL heldRs. 10,427,431 in gold as part of its InternationalReserves as at 31/12/2008. As this gold is part ofthe International Reserve and not used as acommodity which is traded during the normalcourse of business, gold is fair valued and the gainsor losses are transferred to the income statement.Prior to appropriation of profits, the unrealised gainsor losses from gold are transferred to the relevantreserve account.Derivative InstrumentsThe Bank’s involvement in derivative instrumentsis mainly in forward foreign exchange contracts.Such derivative financial instruments are stated atfair value. The fair value of forward exchangecontracts is calculated by reference to currentforward exchange rates for contracts with similarmaturity profiles. All derivative instruments in a gainor loss position, if any, are reported within thebalance of foreign currency trading or available forsale securities in the Balance Sheet.

International Monetary Fund (IMF) RelatedBalances

The Bank transacts with the International MonetaryFund (IMF) in its own right rather than as an agentfor the Government of Sri Lanka. All transactionsby the Bank with the IMF have been included inthese financial statements on that basis.

The Bank as an asset records quota with the IMFand the amount payable to the IMF for quota isrecorded as a liability of the Bank. The cumulativeallocation of SDRs by the IMF is treated as aliability. Exchange gains and losses arising onrevaluation of IMF assets and liabilities at theexchange rate applying at balance sheet date aspublished by the IMF are recognised in the IncomeStatement.

All other charges and interest pertaining to balanceswith the IMF are recorded immediately in theIncome Statement.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at foreignbanks and financial institutions and short-termdeposits.

As a part of local currency activities CBSL generatescertain income and incurs expenses, which do notinvolve in movement of cash. Those activities resultin certain assets and liabilities and mainly compriseof the transactions with GOSL and transactions withdomestic banks and financial institutions.Transactions with GOSL include the purchase ofun-subscribed portions of Treasury bills and bonds

As the sole statutory authority, CBSL issuescurrency to the public in line with Monetary LawAct. Currency issued by CBSL represents a claimon the Bank in favour of the holder. This is a liabilityon the part of the CBSL while it is an item of cashin the hands of the holder. Movement in circulationcurrency is included as part of financing activitiesin line with prevailing industry practice among thosecentral banks which present cash flow statements.

CBSL through the cash/pay order process disbursescash in the form of Notes and Coins or chequesdrawn on CBSL, to various drawees includingsuppliers and employees for goods and servicesobtained, which is either added to the currency incirculation liability or Deposits by Banks andFinancial Institutions. Such forms of utilization ofcurrency for the purposes of CBSL’s payments formpart of cash outflows of CBSL.

For the purposes of the Cash Flow Statement, cashand cash equivalents consist of cash and cashequivalents as defined above, net of cash/ pay orderoutflows.

Repurchase and Reverse-RepurchaseTransactions

Securities sold under agreements to repurchasecontinue to be recorded as assets in the BalanceSheet. The obligation to repurchase (Securities SoldUnder Agreements to Repurchase) is disclosed as aliability. The difference between the sale andrepurchase price in repurchase transactions and thepurchase price and sale price in reverse-repurchasetransactions represents an expense and incomerespectively and recognised in the IncomeStatement.

Securities held under reverse-repurchaseagreements are recorded as an asset in the BalanceSheet (Securities Purchased Under Agreements toRe-sell). Both repurchase and reverse-repurchasetransactions are reported at the transaction valueinclusive of any accrued income or expense.

CBSL Securities

The Bank issues CBSL Securities from time to timeunder its Monetary Policy operations to absorbexcess liquidity in the market.

The securities issued are recorded as a liability. Thedifference between the issue price and the face valueis recorded as an expense in the Income Statement.

Investment Portfolio – Sri Lanka GovernmentSecurities

The Bank’s investment portfolio consists of treasurybills and bonds purchased from Government of SriLanka. The portfolio is recorded in the BalanceSheet at amortised cost since they represent loansprovided to the GOSL.

Advances to Government

Advances to Government represents directprovisional advances made to Government of SriLanka under Section 89 of the Monetary Law ActNo 58 of 1949 of Sri Lanka, as amended.

Loans to Other Institutions

Loans granted to Other Institutions are recognisedand carried at the original granted amount less anallowance for any uncollectible amounts. Anallowance for doubtful debts (for loan impairment)is established if there is objective evidence that theBank will not be able to collect all amounts due.The amount of the allowance is the differencebetween the carrying amount and the estimatedrecoverable amount. Bad debts are written off whenidentified.

Securities LendingTransfer of securities to counter parties underlending transactions is only reflected on the balancesheet if the risks and rewards of ownership are alsotransferred.

Impairment of Financial AssetsThe Bank assesses at each balance sheet datewhether a financial asset is impaired.

Assets carried at Amortised Cost

If there is objective evidence that an impairmentloss on loans and receivables carried at amortisedcost has been incurred, the amount of the loss ismeasured as the difference between the asset’scarrying amount and the present value of estimatedfuture cash flows (excluding future credit losses thathave not been incurred) discounted at the financialasset’s original effective interest rate (i.e. theeffective interest rate computed at initialrecognition). The carrying amount of the asset shallbe reduced either directly or through use of anallowance account. The amount of the loss shall berecognised in the Income Statement.

The Bank first assesses whether objective evidenceof impairment exists individually for financial assetsthat are individually significant, and individuallyor collectively for financial assets that are notindividually significant. If it is determined that noobjective evidence of impairment exists for anindividually assessed financial asset, whethersignificant or not, the asset is included in a groupof financial assets with similar credit riskcharacteristics and that group of financial assets iscollectively assessed for impairment. Assets that areindividually assessed for impairment and for whichan impairment loss is or continues to be recognisedare not included in a collective assessment ofimpairment.

If, in a subsequent period, the amount of theimpairment loss decreases and the decrease can berelated objectively to an event occurring after theimpairment was recognised, the previouslyrecognised impairment loss is reversed. Anysubsequent reversal of an impairment loss isrecognised in the income statement, to the extentthat the carrying value of the asset does not exceedits amortised cost at the reversal date.

Available-for-Sale Investments

If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amountcomprising the difference between its cost (net ofany principal payment and amortisation) and itscurrent fair value, less any impairment losspreviously recognized in profit or loss, is transferredfrom equity to the income statement. Reversals inrespect of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not recognised in profit. Reversals ofimpairment losses on debt instruments are reversedthrough profit or loss, if the increase in fair valueof the instrument can be objectively related to anevent occurring after the impairment loss wasrecognised in profit or loss.

Foreign Currency Term Liabilities

Foreign currency term liabilities are subsequentlyreported at the amortised cost of the liabilities.Changes in the value of these liabilities arerecognised as an increase or decrease in the valueof the term liabilities in the Balance Sheet. Gainsand losses arising from changes in value of foreigncurrency term liabilities are recognised immediatelyas expenses in the Income Statement. Where theliability is still owed, the gain or loss is reported as(Gain) /Loss from Unrealised Price Revaluation.Where the gain or loss has been realised (throughrepayment of the liability), this is reported as (Gains)/Losses Realised from Price Changes.

Financial Guarantees

Financial Guarantees are initially recognised in thefinancial statements at fair value under OtherPayables, at fair value. Subsequent to initialrecognition, the Bank’s liability under eachguarantee is measured at the best estimate ofexpenditure required to settle any financialobligation arising as a result of the guarantee.

Other Financial Assets and Liabilities

Local and foreign currency cash, deposits and short-term advances are recognised on trade date.

1.4.3Other Assets and Liabilities

Investments in Associates

The Bank’s investments in associates, together withthe ones that are held for subsequent disposals areaccounted for under cost method.

Inventories

Inventories are carried at lower of cost and netrealisable value. Cost is determined on a weightedaverage basis. Allowance is made for slow movinginventories.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, Plant and Equipment is stated at cost,excluding the costs of day-to-day servicing, lessaccumulated depreciation and accumulatedimpairment in value. Such cost includes the cost ofreplacing part of such Property, Plant andEquipment when that cost is incurred if therecognition criteria are met. Land and buildings aremeasured at fair value less depreciation on Buildingsand impairment charged subsequent to the date ofthe revaluation.

Except for the freehold land, depreciation iscalculated on a straight-line method over thefollowing estimated useful lives.

The carrying values of plant and equipment arereviewed for impairment when events or changesin circumstances indicate that the carrying valuemay not be recoverable. Following initialrecognition at cost, land and buildings are carriedat a revalued amount, which is the fair value at thedate of the revaluation less any subsequentaccumulated depreciation on buildings andsubsequent accumulated impairment losses.

Valuations are performed frequently enough toensure that the fair value of a revalued asset doesnot differ materially from its carrying amount.

Any revaluation surplus is credited to theRevaluation Reserve included in the equity section

Assumptions used for computation of fairvaluation

• The staff loans granted during the year 2008 isconsidered.• The date of staff loan granted is considered as1st January 2008.• There were no amendments or settlements forthese loans.Other sundry assets are carried at expected realisablevalues.

Impairment of Non-Financial AssetsThe Bank assesses at each reporting date if eventsor changes in circumstances indicate that thecarrying value may be impaired, whether there isan indication that a non-financial asset may beimpaired. If any such indication exists, the Bankmakes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount.Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds itsrecoverable amount, the asset is considered impairedand is written down to its recoverable amount.ProvisionsProvisions are recognised when the Bank has apresent obligation (legal or constructive) as a resultof a past event, it is probable that an outflow ofresources embodying economic benefits will berequired to settle the obligation and a reliableestimate can be made of the amount of theobligation. Where the Bank expects a provision tobe reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised asa separate asset but only when the reimbursementis virtually certain.Currency in CirculationCurrency issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lankarepresents a claim on the Bank in favour of theholder. The liability for Currency in Circulation isrecorded at face value in the Balance Sheet.

which case the increase is recognised in IncomeStatement. A revaluation deficit is recognised inIncome Statement, except that a deficit directlyoffsetting a previous surplus on the same asset isdirectly offset against the surplus in the RevaluationReserve. Upon disposal, any revaluation surplusrelating to the particular asset being sold istransferred to retained earnings. An item of Property,Plant and Equipment is de-recognised upon disposalor when no future economic benefits are expectedfrom its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising onde-recognition of the asset (calculated as thedifference between the net disposal proceeds andthe carrying amount of the asset) is included in theIncome Statement in the year the asset is de-recognised. The asset’s residual values, useful liveand methods are reviewed, and adjusted ifappropriate, regularly.

The costof providing benefits under the defined benefit plansis determined separately for each plan using theprojected unit credit actuarial valuation method.Actuarial valuations are carried out once in everythree years.

The Past service cost is recognised as an expenseon a straight-line basis over the average period untilthe benefits become vested. If the benefits arealready vested immediately following theintroduction of, or changes to, a benefit plan, pastservice cost is recognised immediately.

Actuarial gains and losses arising from experienceadjustments and changes in actuarial assumptionsin excess of the greater of 10% of the value of planassets or 10% of the defined benefit obligation arecharged or credited to income over the employeesexpected average remaining working lives, in asystematic method that results in faster recognitionof actuarial gains and losses.

Defined Contribution Plans

The Bank contributes 24% and 3% ofemployees’ gross emoluments to Employees’Provident Fund and Employees’ Trust Fundrespectively which are separately administereddefined contribution plans.

Grants

Grants recognised at their fair value (where there isa reasonable assurance that the grant will be receivedand all attaching conditions, if any, will be compliedwith) are shown under equity. When the grant relatesto an expense item it is recognised in the IncomeStatement over the periods necessary to match themto the expenses it is intended to compensate on asystematic basis. Where the grant relates to an asset,the fair value is credited to a deferred governmentgrant account and is released to the IncomeStatement over the expected useful life of therelevant asset on a systematic basis consistent withthe depreciation policy of the related asset.

Personnel Expenses

1.5Nature and Extent of Activities

The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of SriLanka is, in addition to determining the policies ormeasures authorized to be adopted or taken underMonetary Law Act No 58 of 1949 of Sri Lanka asamended, vested with the powers, duties andfunctions of the Central Bank and be generallyresponsible for the management, operations andadministration of the Bank. The Bank is primarilyresponsible for the administration, supervision andregulation of monetary, financial, and paymentsystem of Sri Lanka and also acts as the fiscal agentof the Government. The activities of the Bankmainly include:

–Implementing monetary and exchange ratepolices.–Issuing of currency.–Facilitating free competition and stability in thefinancial system.–Licensing and supervision of defined financialinstitutions.–Organization and management of the inter-banksettlement system and promotion of the smoothfunctioning of the payments system.–Providing loans and advances to theGovernment, bank’s and financial institutionsunder various facilities.–Acting as a depository of the Government underspecific arrangements with Government andagencies acting on behalf of the Government.

The activities carried out in order to achieve itsobjective of economic, price and financial systemstability with a view to encouraging and promotingthe development of the productive resources of SriLanka, can be broadly segregated into foreigncurrency and local currency activities. Results ofthese activities are taken to mean OperatingActivities in the context of the Income Statement.Foreign Currency ActivitiesForeign currency activities result mainly from theCentral Bank of Sri Lanka’s holdings of foreigncurrency assets under its foreign reservesmanagement function. The foreign reservesmanagement portfolio comprises foreign currency

assets held for foreign exchange interventionpurposes and other foreign currency assets held fortrading purposes.The foreign currency assets are held in variouscurrencies. The majority is denominated in UnitedStates Dollars, Euros, Sterling Pounds and JapaneseYen. The financial instruments held within theseforeign currency portfolios consist mainly ofsovereign securities, securities held under reverse-repurchase transactions or balances held with othercentral banks, commercial banks and custodialinstitutions.The Central Bank of Sri Lanka also holds, fromtime-to-time, foreign currency assets and liabilitiesthat arise from international market operations.Local Currency ActivitiesLocal currency activities arise as follows:(i) Liquidity management operations. Liquiditymanagement largely involves the Central Bankof Sri Lanka offsetting the daily net flows to orfrom government or market by advancing fundsto or withdrawing funds from the bankingsystem.

(RTGS), by providing the Intra Day Liquidity Facility(ILF) to commercial banks and primary dealers.

6.1Implementation of Monetary Policy

(a)Open Market Operations (OMO)

The department conducts OMO to maintain reservemoney within the quarterly targets set to achieve thefinal objective of price stability and as far as it isfeasible, to contain the volatility in the inter bankinterest rates. Accordingly, the department absorbedliquidity aggressively while placing limits on accessby commercial banks and primary dealers to fundsfrom the Central Bank to achieve the reserve moneytargets and excessive volatility in interest rates wascontained by establishing an upper ceiling on interbank interest rates and preventing a buildup ofexcessive liquidity shortages in the banking system.

The absorption of liquidity was continued both on atemporary basis through overnight Repurchase(Repo) transactions and a permanent basis throughoutright sales of Treasury bills held by the Bank. Inaddition, this year, absorption on a relatively longerterm basis was also introduced through term Repotransactions. Moreover, in the absence of a sufficientvolume of Treasury bills with the Central Bank dueto continued absorption, the Central Bank issued itsown securities to absorb liquidity both on a daily basisand term basis.

In line with this strategy, the Central Bank continuedwith the limit on access of commercial banks andprimary dealers to the Reverse Repurchase (ReverseRepo) facility of the Central Bank to three times permonth per institute and the magnitude of the fundsreleased under the facility to the estimated liquidityshortfall. The potential excessive volatility in interbank rates was contained by providing funds underReverse Repo facility over and above the allocationunder the Reverse Repo rate of the Central Bank, atthe penal rate of 19 per cent introduced in December2007. A buildup of large liquidity shortages wasprevented by providing liquidity through purchasesof Treasury bills both in the primary and secondarymarkets and by reducing the Statutory ReserveRequirement.

On average, the liquidity position in the bankingsystem remained at a surplus during the first threequarters and turned to a deficit during the last quarterof the year (Chart II – 1). Excess liquidity during thefirst quarter, of about Rs. 8 bn on average, wasprimarily attributed to the large inflow of foreigncurrency to the banking system, which was purchasedby the Central Bank, whilst the peak in surplusliquidity in June was mainly due to the receipt of a

syndicated foreign loan to the government. As in thepreceding years, the first two weeks in April depicteda liquidity shortage due to the high demand forcurrency during the festive season, followed by anincrease in liquidity due to the return of these funds.Meanwhile, a substantial and prolonged liquiditydeficit was experienced during the period ofSeptember to December as a consequence of theCentral Bank continuing to supply foreign exchangeto the market to meet the demand arising mainly fromthe withdrawal of a large part of foreign investmentsin government securities resulting from the globalfinancial crisis.

The Central Bank’s policy rates, i.e., the Repo andReverse Repo rates, remained unchanged at 10.5 percent and 12 per cent, respectively, throughout 2008.The penal rate was maintained at 19 per cent duringthis period.

(i) Auctions Under OMO

Overnight Repo Transactions

The liquidity surplus within the banking system wasabsorbed on a daily basis by conducting auctions tosell Treasury bills on a repurchase basis. On average,Rs. 6.6 bn was offered for the auction, whilst Rs. 5.2bn, representing 71 per cent of estimated liquidity,was absorbed from the auction. The weighted averageyield rate of the auctions depicted a decrease,reducing from 11.93 per cent in January to 11.6 percent by December 2008 (Chart II - 2).

Term Repo Transactions

In May 2008, the Department introduced the termRepo auction to sell Treasury bills as a strategy toabsorb liquidity on a relatively longer term basis. Theperiod of the term auction was one week, whilst theweighted average yield rate was 15.94 per cent.

Reverse Repo Transactions

Reverse Repo auctions were not held during the year2008.

(ii) Standing Facilities

The Department continued to provide the standingfacility to Participating Institutions (PIs) at the Repoand Reverse Repo rates of the Central Bank. Thisfacility was provided to PIs that were unable tomanage their short term liquidity requirements fullythrough the inter bank money market and the dailyOMO auctions.

Repo Transactions

The main investors in the Repo standing facility werethose PIs who were unable to participate or thosewhose bids were rejected at the Repo auction. During2008, Repo transactions under the standing facilitywere on average, about Rs 1.4 bn. per day, as themajor portion of excess liquidity was absorbedthrough the OMO overnight Repo auction.

Reverse Repo Transactions

The purpose of the Central Bank’s Reverse Repofacility (RRF) is to fulfill an urgent liquidityrequirement of a participant, as a last resort, whereaccess to alternative sources of funds is not available.As such, the Central Bank attempted to strike abalance between discouraging the excessive use ofthe RRF and meeting the liquidity requirements ofPIs. Accordingly, the Central Bank decided to providethe RRF, at the Reverse Repo rate, upto three timesper calendar month per participant and beyond thislimit at a penal rate of 19 per cent per annum, witheffect from 22nd February 2008, only on days whenthere was a liquidity shortfall in the system. Inaddition, RRF at the penal rate was also madeavailable on days when the system’s liquidity wasbroadly in balance.

During October 2008, when the market experienceda significant liquidity shortage due to the adversedevelopments in the global financial markets, theCentral Bank relaxed the restrictions on RRF by

permitting PIs to utilise the RRF facility at theReverse Repo rate upto 10 times per calendar monthand to borrow at 19 per cent thereafter, in view of theurgent liquidity needs of the PIs. However, theserestrictions were tightened once more to only threetimes a calendar month, with effect from 1st

November 2008, in order to continue with the tightmonetary policy stance.

The RRF under the standing facility was utilisedextensively by PIs, especially during the last quarterof 2008, as a consequence of the substantial liquiditydeficit in the system. Accordingly, RRF granted atthe Reverse Repo rate and the penal rate amountedto Rs. 377.5 bn and Rs. 527 bn, respectively.

(iii) Issue of Central Bank Securities

Central Bank securities (CBSL securities) wereissued on an overnight basis (with one day maturity)and term basis in the absence of a sufficient volumeof Treasury bills with the Central Bank to absorbsurplus liquidity. The first auction to issue CBSLsecurities on overnight basis was held on 26th June2008 and these securities were subsequently usedextensively during the period of July to September2008, to absorb excess liquidity on overnight basis.

On average, Rs. 6.4 bn was offered for the CBSLsecurities auctions, whilst Rs. 5.2bn, representing77.7 per cent of estimated liquidity during this period,was absorbed from the auctions. The weightedaverage yield rates of the auctions ranged between11.64 per cent to 11.89 per cent during June toSeptember 2008. CBSL securities were also issuedunder the standing facility at the Repo rate and theamount issued was on average, about Rs 1.4 bn. perday.

The Department also conducted several term auctionsto issue CBSL securities, as a strategy to absorbliquidity on a relatively longer term basis. The totalamount issued was Rs. 10 bn. The period of the termauctions ranged from two to three weeks, whilst theweighted average yield rates were around 15.7 percent.

(iv) Outright Transactions

The Central Bank conducted outright auctions to sellTreasury bills out of its own portfolio, in order toabsorb excess liquidity on a permanent basis.Similarly, the Central Bank introduced auctions forthe outright purchase of Treasury bills in order toinject liquidity to the market on a permanent basis inOctober 2008, for the first time after introducing theOMO framework of market based monetary policyoperations in 2003.

(XXVIII)

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report 2008

Part II

The total value of Treasury bills sold and purchasedthrough these outright auctions amounted to Rs. 26.6bn and Rs. 8 bn, respectively. The tenure of theTreasury bills sold were very short term, ranging from10 to 49 days, whilst the yield rates were below thecomparable weighted average yield rates of 91 dayTreasury bills in the primary market. In contrast, thetenure of the Treasury bills purchased tended to berelatively longer, with the remaining days to maturityranging from 53 to 291 days. The weighted averagerate of these purchases were above the comparableweighted average yield rates of Treasury bills in theprimary market at the time of each outright purchase.

(b)Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR)

The Department is responsible for enforcing the SRRas a monetary policy instrument. The prolongedliquidity shortage in the banking system, resultingfrom the Central Bank’s intervention in the marketto supply foreign currency to meet the demand in thedomestic dollar market, led to adverse consequenceson economic activities. The Central Bank initiatedmeasures to inject additional liquidity on a permanentbasis to ease any liquidity constraints that may arise,by reducing the SRR. Accordingly, the SRR, whichhad remained unchanged at 10 per cent since 19th

October 2001 was reduced by 75 basis points to 9.25per cent of deposit liabilities, with effect from 17th

October 2008, thus releasing liquidity of about Rs.7.5 bn into the market. However, in view of thecontinued liquidity deficit, the SRR was furtherreduced by 150 basis points to 7.75 per cent, witheffect from 28th November 2008. This move releaseda further Rs. 17 bn into the market, thus easing theliquidity shortfall.

(c)Bank Rate

The Central Bank’s rate of interest (Bank rate) onshort term advances to licensed commercial banks,stipulated under Section 87 of the Monetary Law Act,remained unchanged at 15 per cent. However, thisrate was inoperative as no bank resorted to borrowingfrom the Central Bank at the Bank rate.

6.2Functioning as Banker to Commercial Banks andthe Government

6.2.1 Accounts of Financial InstitutionsThe Department provided current account facilitiesto commercial banks and primary dealers, to ensurean efficient inter bank payment and settlementsystem, thus facilitating the Central Bank’s role ofbeing the Banker to commercial banks. Theseaccounts were operated on a Real Time GrossSettlement (RTGS) basis within the automatedgeneral ledger system of the Bank.

6.2.2 Government AccountsThe Department also maintained the accounts ofgovernment departments, government agencies andinstitutions and certain statutory boards, providingthem with required banking facilities, in functioningas the Banker to the government. The total numberof accounts maintained by the Central Bankamounted to 52 as at end 2008, with two new accountsbeing opened and two being closed at the request ofthe government. In terms of Section 89 of theMonetary Law Act, the Central Bank providesprovisional advances to the government free ofcharge, with the limit on such advances being 10 percent of the estimated government revenue. In 2008,the limit on the provisional advance was increasedby Rs. 15.1 bn. to Rs. 77 bn.

6.3Provision of Intra Day Liquidity Facility (ILF)

The Department ensured the smooth and efficientfunctioning of the RTGS system by providing ILF tocommercial banks and primary dealers. This facilitywas provided free of charge against the collateral ofgovernment Treasury bills and bonds, which werevalued at their current market prices with a sufficienthair cut added to cover for any variations in pricesduring the day.

The total value and average value of ILF drawn duringthe year amounted to Rs. 2,186 bn and Rs. 9.07 bn,respectively (Chart II – 3), whilst the correspondingfigures for 2007 were Rs. 1,222 bn and Rs. 5.03 bnrespectively. Implementing strict measures, such asthe penalty interest at the Bank rate and thesuspension of the facility for repeated defaults haveensured the prompt reversal of ILF before the closeof business of LankaSettle. As a consequence, therewere no ILF defaults during the year.

7.ECONOMIC RESEARCH

The Economic Research Department (ERD)continued to discharge its statutory responsibilities,while functioning as the ‘Economic Think Tank’ inthe Central Bank. In fulfilling its vital statutoryobligations, ERD engaged itself in providing

8.1Membership, Member Balances and Refunds

The Fund (total liability to members) as at end of2008 stood at Rs. 645.0 billion reflecting an increaseof 17.4 per cent or Rs. 95.6 billion from Rs. 549.4billion as at end 2007 (Table II-1). This was mainlydue to the increase in number of members and theircontributions during the year and distribution ofincome among the members for the year. The totalnumber of member-accounts increased to 12.46million of which 2.3 million were contributing/activemember accounts. The number of contributingemployers stood at 64,000 at the end of 2008registering an increase of 4.7 per cent from 61,116in 2007. The net contribution (contribution lessrefunds of benefits) stood at Rs. 20.02 billion duringthe year compared with Rs. 18.8 billion in 2007. Thetotal amount refunded to members and their legalheirs in 2008 was Rs. 25.9 billion, showing anincrease of 19.2 per cent from Rs. 21.8 billion in 2007while the number of refunds increased by 2.8 per centover the previous year.

8.2Investment of Funds and Return

(a) Investment Portfolio: The total investmentportfolio of the Fund grew by 15.8 per cent to Rs.627billion as at end 2008 from Rs. 541 billion as at end2007 (Table II-2). EPF Department continued toinvest the moneys of the Fund in line with the Fund’sinvestment policy, i.e. to ensure a long-term positivereal rate of return to the members while maintainingthe safety of funds and liquidity to meet refundpayments and other expenditure. Accordingly, 96.9per cent of the portfolio was held in governmentsecurities. The balance was placed on corporatedebentures, equities (2.5 per cent) and high liquid

assets such as repos (0.6 per cent) to maintain ahealthy liquidity position.

(b) Revenue: Total income on investments increasedby 33.8 per cent to Rs. 79.5 billion in 2008 from Rs.59.4 billion in 2007 (Table II-3). As in the past, theinterest income including amortization gain was themajor source of income to the Fund. This has beenattributed to discounted bonds in the governmentsecurities portfolio. Interest income grew by Rs. 20.1billion to Rs. 78.9 billion from Rs. 58.8 billion in2007. The rate of return on average total portfolioincreased to 13.8 per cent in 2008 from 12.7 per centin 2007. Since 96.5 per cent of the funds wereinvested in government securities at different interestrates in the past, the total return on investment washighly correlated with maturity profile of governmentsecurities portfolio. The Weighted Average Returnon government securities for the year 2008 was 13.9per cent and yield varied between 10.4 per cent and15.3 percent depending on the maturity as at the endof 2008 (Table II-4). The capital gains and dividendsrealized from equity portfolio declined significantlyby 48 per cent to Rs. 225 million in 2008 from Rs.434 million in 2007 mainly due to depressed marketconditions. Accordingly, the rate of return on theaverage equity portfolio stood at 3.8 per cent asagainst 8.3 per cent in 2007.

The Fundmanaged to maintain its total operational expenditureat 0.80 per cent of its total gross income in 2008.Maintaining operational expenditure below 1 per centof the gross income has been a key feature of theFund over the years.

8.3Payment of Interest on Member Balances

In 2008, a sum of Rs. 75,466 million was availablefor distribution as interest to the members of the Fund(Table II-6). Accordingly, interest payments tomember balances stood at a rate of 13.2 per cent ontotal member balances. When compared to the interestrate of 11.2 per cent paid to members in 2007, thiswas an increase of 200 basis points. However, in viewof the practice of paying interest on the year-endbalance for the full year, the Effective Rate of Interest(EIR)1 is estimated at 13.44 per cent.

8.4Member-Account StatementsThe member-account statements for the first half of2008 were issued to members through their employersduring December 2008. Arrangements were made toissue account statements for the second half of 2008by end of June 2009.

EPF continued to issue certificates of guarantees tomembers as against their EPF balances under theHousing Loan Scheme. This scheme which wasintroduced in 1988 facilitates the members to obtainhousing loans from 6 participating lendinginstitutions, namely, Bank of Ceylon, People’s Bank,Housing Development and Finance Corporation,State Mortgage and Investment Bank, Co-operativeRural Banks and National Housing and DevelopmentAuthority.

launched during the year utilizing the mobile phonecommunication channels. Software development forthe Re-engineering of EPF internal operationscommenced during the year. The objective of the re-engineering process is to improve the current businessprocesses by means of enhancing efficiency andeffectiveness by greater integration among differentsub-systems. To expedite the EPF-Housing Loangranting facility, ITD introduced a decentralizedHousing Loan certificate issuing system and alsodeveloped a system to facilitate EPF beneficiaries toinvest their EPF refunds in government securities.

A major milestone during the year was theintroduction of a job costing system for all softwaredevelopment projects and IT services supplied by thedepartment. Accordingly, on completion of thesystem study or provision of the required services,IT department has submitted the project/ service costto client departments.

13.2 IT Risk Management

One of the major responsibilities of the ITDepartment was to maintain the systemicallyimportant payment systems and related interfacesoftware to ensure maximum availability for real timesettlement of transactions. As at 31st December 2008,the ITD has been able to achieve an uptime of 99.6per cent for the Payment systems.

The intrusion prevention system installed at the Banknetwork gateway was further strengthened to detectand prevent the hacking attempts to the Bank ITsystems. Since the threats to IT security cannot bemitigated by technological solutions alone, theinstitutional information security policy was reviewedand updated.

ITD officers actively participated in BCPinspection reviews of Lanka Settle participants.

As CBSL functions are carried out in a pre-dominantly automated environment, a rapid responseto user queries has become very critical. An IT Help

Desk operational from 0700h to 1830h fulfills theircritical requirements. To record, monitor and respondto the IT incidents and help desk queries, an in-housedeveloped application, Issue tracker wasimplemented.

13.3 IT Infrastructure Developments

The Central Bank wide area network (CBSLNET)which is connected to the Treasury offices of banksand primary dealers was administered to provide theexpected services to the financial sector. During theyears, arrangements were finalized to transfer themaintenance cost of leased lines which was earlierborne by CBSL to participating institutions. Further,strengthening of the CBSL LAN was continued byinstalling IS appliances such as firewalls and IntrusionDetection/Prevention systems. The Internet linecapacity was expanded to 2Mbps considering the highdemand for web browsing to promote knowledgeculture and make information backed decisions,address the need for having a faster dedicated linefor financial institutions to access the Bank’s webapplications for regulatory reporting purposes.

14.INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

International Operations Department (IOD) isentrusted with the responsibility of managing theofficial foreign exchange reserves of the countrywhich are maintained, as required by the MonetaryLaw Act to facilitate maintenance of external stabilityof the Sri Lanka rupee and to assure the maximumpossible freedom of the country’s internationaltransactions. At the same time, department alsomonitors the domestic foreign exchange market toensure its smooth operations.

14.1 Foreign Exchange Reserve Management

The year 2008 was a challenging year for globalinvestors. The global financial sector experiencedunprecedented challenges starting in 2007 with thesub prime mortgage crisis and created profoundspillover effects to the rest of the global economy.As a result, prospects for global growth havedeteriorated and financial markets experiencedunprecedented problems. This in turn together withenergy crisis and food crisis caused recessionary fearsacross most major economies in 2008. Most of thecommercial banks worldwide during this year weredown graded. The financial market turmoilcontinuously threatened the world interest rates aswell as asset prices resulting in drastic decline incommodity prices except gold. Widespreadreluctance to lend resulted from bank and financialfailures in major financial markets significantlyconstrained the foreign currency credit lines availableto commercial banks and other financial institutions.This liquidity and credit crunch developed in theinternational market has also resulted in thewithdrawal of foreign holdings on Sri Lanka Treasurybills and bonds creating an added pressure on theexchange rate of the Sri Lanka Rupee. As such, thereserves management was a challenging task duringthe year 2008.

Investments of foreign exchange reserves were donein accordance with the Foreign Exchange Reserve

Management guidelines approved by the MonetaryBoard, under the supervision of the Foreign ReservesManagement Committee (FRMC). The foreignexchange reserves which consisted of currencies suchas US Dollars, Euros, Sterling Pounds, AustralianDollars and gold were invested mainly in two assetclasses namely, Fixed Income Securities and moneymarket instruments. Bank’s Fixed Income Securitiesportfolio consisted of highly rated sovereigngovernment securities, government guaranteedsecurities, and securities of government agencies andsupranational institutions. The transactions oninvestments on both fixed income securities andmoney market were performed only through highlyrated and approved counter parties within the limitsstructure approved by the management, paying dueconsideration to safety, liquidity and return on suchassets. Liquidity requirements of the Bank, debtservice repayments, risk management parameters,income generating abilities and specific directionsof the Monetary Board were the key issues consideredin determining the asset and currency compositionof the reserves portfolio.

In order to reduce the exposure to any sudden increasein credit risk, investments held with commercialbanks were withdrawn and reinvested with CentralBanks and BIS (Bank for International Settlement).Liquidity requirements were fulfilled by maintaininga sufficient proportion of reserves in highly liquidshort-term instruments of both asset classes.

Nevertheless, the Bank’s overall reserve managementoperations have generated a net foreign income ofUS$ 153 million or Rs. 16,687 million during theyear 2008, exceeding the budgeted income of US$118 million and the income of the previous yearamounting to US$ 125 million. In the midst ofcomparatively lower interest rates prevailed in majoreconomics, capital gains on fixed income securitiescontributed to the increase in income.

14.2 Risk Management

The risks associated with the foreign exchangereserves and their investments are monitoredcontinually by the Middle Office of the IOD. Theforeign exchange reserves and their investments areexposed to various categories of risks. Among theserisk categories, foreign exchange risk, interest raterisk, credit risk, liquidity risk and operational risksare considered as major components. Foreignexchange risk or the risk of capital loss as aconsequence of fluctuations in exchange rates ismanaged mainly through diversification ofinvestment currencies. Interest rate risk or theexposure of the Bank’s reserves portfolio to

movements in interest rates was managed throughthe appropriate adjustment of the duration of theportfolio. Counterparty Credit Risk ManagementSystem (CCRMS) is used by the IOD to manage thecredit risk. The liquidity risk, which is the risk ofincurring capital losses in the event of forcedliquidation, is managed by establishing liquidityrequirements and maintaining sufficient proportionof assets in highly liquid form. The operational riskresulting from human error, flawed systems andinadequate procedures and controls were managedthrough a range of measures.

Appropriate precautionary measures such as divertingmoney market investments to central banks andtimely eliminating of exposure to foreign commercialbanks, limiting trading activities during highlyvolatile market conditions, strengthening themonitoring and evaluation of credit and liquidity riskwere adopted by the IOD to mitigate the adverseimpact caused through the global financial crisis.

14.3 Monitoring the Domestic Foreign ExchangeMarket Developments

The activities of monitoring domestic foreignexchange market, mainly the foreign exchangetransactions and overnight net foreign exchangepositions of commercial banks were continued duringthe year 2008 by the department with a view ofpromoting the smooth functioning of the domesticforeign exchange market and to ensure an orderlyadjustment of the exchange rate of the Sri Lankarupee.

Further relaxation of foreign investments in Sri LankaGovernment securities has resulted in increasedforeign exchange inflows and pressurized on theexchange rate during the first eight months of theyear. In order to prevent appreciation of Sri Lankarupee and the resultant negative impact on theeconomy, exports, imports, etc. the Central Bankpurchased excess foreign exchange from thedomestic foreign exchange market, which totaled USdollars 674 million. However, the situation changeddue to the global financial crisis since September2008. The CBSL had to intervene in the domesticforeign exchange market to smooth-out excessivefluctuations created due to sudden outflow of foreignexchange during the last four months of the year.Withdrawal of foreign holdings on Sri LankaGovernment Treasury bills/bonds and the settlementof the petroleum import bills on purchases made atcomparatively higher price levels falling due in thelast quarter of the year contributed towards significantforeign currency outflows. As such, the CBSL

injected US dollar 1532 mn to the domestic foreignexchange market during the year 2008.

The exchange rate of Sri Lanka rupee had shown adepreciation of 3.91 percent during the year 2008against the US dollars. It moved from rupees 108.71per US$ at the end of 2007 to 113.13 per US$ at theend of 2008.

The volume of inter-bank foreign exchangetransactions increased to US dollars 14,132 millionin 2008 from US dollars 9,275 million in 2007recording a significant growth of 52.36 per centduring the year 2008.

Further, the department revised the permitted net openforeign exchange exposure positions of commercialbanks in 2008, aimed at controlling the level ofspeculative transaction volume that threaten thesmooth operations of the domestic foreign exchangemarket. The process of providing exchange ratesinformation of Sri Lanka rupee against other foreigncurrencies to Government Departments andCorporations, local and foreign agencies and otherparties continued during 2008.

served an efficient catering service was provided withavailable staff.

A series of lectures on various topics such as healthand general topics were conducted by the departmentfor the benefit of the staff in 2008. Also useful healthtips were circulated by using electronic media.

20.PUBLIC DEBT

Public Debt Department (PDD) continued to carryoutits responsibilities relating to issuing and managingpublic debt on behalf of the government as its agentwith improved accountability and transparency.Accordingly, the PDD raised funds required to

finance government needs at lowest possible cost overmedium to long run and with a prudent degree ofrisk, maintained the unblemished debt servicingrecord by settling government debt servicingobligations on time with 100 per cent accuracy andtook every possible measures to broaden and deepenthe Government Securities (GS) market. As per thestrategic plan of the Central Bank in 2008, the PDDupdated the medium term debt management strategy,which formulated in 2007. The debt managementstrategy addresses the bunching of debt maturities,the fragmentation problem in the Treasury bondprogramme, the development of long-term yieldcurve, development of a credible and liquid debtmarket and recording of all investor transactions ofGS transactions in the Central Depository System(CDS). It also recommended a cautious borrowingplan to reach the medium term debt/GDP target, tobroaden investor base, to strengthen the existingregulatory and payments and settlements frameworkand to restructure the primary dealer system.

The maturity structure of the outstanding debt profileindicates that there is a significant bunching of debtmaturities towards the shorter end of the maturityprofile. In 2008 the PDD was able to ease thebunching problem in the Treasury bills programmeand smoothen the maturity structure by increasingthe issuance of 364 day Treasury bills and limitingthe issuance of 91 day bills. However, it was notpossible to issue Treasury bonds with longermaturities due to the high yield rates prevailed forlong term maturities in the market. The PDDcontinued the policy of re-opening the existingTreasury bond series limiting the introduction of newbond series to the market as much as possible toaddress high fragmentation of the domestic debtmarket. However, sharp increase of borrowings fromdomestic sources due to shifting of external foreignborrowings to domestic sources affected the plannedreduction of number of bond series in 2008. Despitethis issue, the PDD was able to maintain the totalnumber of Treasury bond series at 42 at the end 2008,as in 2007. Considering the importance of thestrengthening of the Primary Dealer (PD) system thePDD has taken necessary steps to restructure the PDsystem in order to diversify their activities andpending necessary legal approval to implement theprogramme.

In 2008, licensed commercial banks were permittedto purchase international sovereign bonds issued bythe government in 2007, at the secondary market witha view to enhance the liquidity of the sovereign bonds.In order to broaden the investor base in the GS market

and to lower the pressure on the interest rates in thedomestic market, Treasury bill market was alsoopened to foreign investors in May 2008 allowingthem to invest in Treasury bills up to 10 per cent ofoutstanding stock.

With the introduction of CBSL Wide Area Networkbased application to record small value transactionsof GS and the introduction of mandatory requirementof recording transaction in the system, the value oftransactions took place through Scripless SecuritiesSettlement System (SSSS), and the number ofaccounts maintained at Central Depositary System(CDS) has significantly increased in 2008 comparedwith the previous year. This measure helped toenhance the safety of small investors in the GSmarket. In addition, the PDD introduced PersonalComputer Based Payment and Securities SettlementSystem that can be used as an alternative settlementsystem in an event of prolonged and unrecoverableLankaSettle Application System.

In order to expand the GS market and diversifyingthe investor base, the PDD conducted an aggressiveinvestor awareness programme through electronicmedia and, public and educational seminar campaignthroughout the year. In addition the PDD released adocumentary film on GS in 2008 to educate generalpublic and it was telecasted through various TVchannels and at various forums, exhibitions andseminars. In 2008, PDD continued to publish itsannual publication on public debt management in SriLanka with a view to enhance the transparency inpublic debt operations and disseminate informationon level and management of public debt to the generalpublic, policy makers, academics and players in theGS market. PDD arranged a non-deal road show inselected Middle-East countries to test the investorappetite and expand the investor base for the country.In addition, a team of officers representing theMinistry of Finance, Attorney Generals Dept. and theCentral Bank were trained on various products issuedunder the Sharia principles to tap investors inMiddle-East market.

PDD also facilitated two sovereign rating missionswith Fitch Ratings and Standards and Poor’s in 2008and a seminar on sovereign ratings was arranged withthe assistance of JP Morgan rating advisors to theCBSL staff and MOF officials.

20.1 Developments in 2008

(a)Borrowing Target and StrategyIn terms of the Appropriation Act No.61 of 2007,Parliament approved total gross borrowing limit ofthe government for 2008, in terms of book value, was

amounted to Rs. 708 billion including Rs. 19 billionprovision for contingencies. Of this borrowing limit,Rs. 475 billion was expected to be financed fromdomestic sources while the balance Rs. 233 billionwas expected to mobilize through foreign sources.However, the global financial turmoil, existed duringthe later part of the year did not permit governmentto mobilize expected foreign commercial borrowingsand it had to be shifted to domestic borrowings.Accordingly, given domestic borrowings increasedby Rs.76 billion to Rs. 551 billion and gross foreignborrowings delivered by Rs.97 billion to Rs.136billion during 2008 while maintaining totalborrowings within the original gross borrowing target.In line with the high inflation experienced since 2007,domestic interest rates were remained high during2008. Therefore, PDD had to rely more on short termand medium term domestic debt instruments ratherthan longer-term debt instruments. Thus, Rs. 61.9billion was raised through Treasury bills and Rs.406.5 billion was raised through Treasury bondscompared with original target of Rs. 10 billion andRs. 362 billion respectively. In addition Rs. 36.1billion (US Dollar 335 million) borrowed throughSLDB in 2008 out of the target of Rs. 37.6 billion(US Dollar 360 million). The PDD did not issue anyRupee loan during 2008 continuing the strategy ofcutting down non-marketable debt stock from thedomestic debt stock.In 2008 the PDD attempted to ease the monthlybunching pressure in the Treasury bills by limitingissues of 91 day Treasury bills and increasing theissuance of 182 day and 364 day Treasury bills.Accordingly, issue of Treasury bills with 3 monthmaturities were reduced to 32 per cent of the totalTreasury bill issues in 2008 from 67 per cent in 2007,and increased issue of 12 month bills to 41 per centin 2008, from 14 per cent in 2007. However, thisstrategy could not be successfully adopted in theTreasury bonds and issue of Treasury bonds withmaturities above 3 year were only 29 per cent of totalissues due to the high yield rates prevailed for longterm maturities in the market.PDD was able to borrow only Rs. 39 billion from theexternal foreign commercial sources in 2008compared to the target of Rs. 67 billion, due to theglobal financial turmoil. Out of this, Rs.16 billionwas raised through a syndicated loan and Rs. 22.9billion raised by issuing Treasury bills and Treasurybonds to foreign investors. Although, governmentexpected Rs.166 billion for public investmentprogramme through Project/ Programme loans fromforeign concessional sources, only Rs.97 billion wererealized during the year 2008.

(c)Debt Service Payments

During the year 2008, the PDD serviced both foreignand domestic loans amounting to Rs. 592.8 billion.Out of the total debt serviced, Rs. 212.5 billion wasfor interest while the principle repayments wereRs. 380.3 billion. Total domestic loan servicedamounted to Rs. 440.9 billion and the foreign debtserviced amounted to Rs.151.9 billion (pre-maturewithdrawals of foreign investments in Treasury bondswere considered as repayments to foreigners). Inaddition, maturing Treasury bills amounting to Rs.678 billion were reissued during the year.

(d)Yield Rates and Secondary Market Performance

The gradually rising trend in the yield rates of GSwhich was experienced over the recent past, turnround since the beginning of 2008. High demand forGS from foreign investors with the opening up ofTreasury bill market to foreigners in May, 2008, lowerinflationary expectations over the second half of theyear, liquidity surplus remained in the market (exceptlatter part of the year) could cited as majorcontributory factors to arrest the increasing trend inthe yield rates in the domestic market.

Treasury bill yield rates for 91, 182 and 364 daymaturities declined by 520 bps, 255 bps and 215 bps,respectively, in the secondary market betweenJanuary to September 2008, while yield rates forTreasury bonds with maturities of 2-5 years declinedby 140-250 bps, during the same period. Bothprimary and secondary market yield curves showeda gradual downward shift, reflecting the decreasingtrend in the interest rates during January to September2008. This is mainly due to the high level ofparticipation by foreign investors in the market.However, the yield rates in both primary andsecondary markets started to increase from Septemberto December as foreign investors started to unloadtheir holdings of GS owing to aggravation of theglobal financial turmoil, creating an excess supplyin the market. Deficit liquidity conditions prevailedin the market since September 2008 also addedpressure on the interest rates in the market. However,by end of the year, the rising trend of the yield rateseased to some extent and the yield rates of thesecondary market stabilized, indicating the positivemarket response to the decreasing inflation andinflationary expectations.

(e)Scripless Securities Settlement System (SSSS) andthe Central Depository System (CDS) –LankaSecure

21.REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT

During the year under review, the RegionalDevelopment Department(RDD) continued to engagein activities aimed at promoting regional developmentinitiatives through coordinating and encouragingcredit delivery to strategic sectors. This was achievedprimarily through a series of refinance, interestsubsidy and credit supplementation schemes. Theimproved security situation that prevailed in the newlyliberated Eastern province in 2008 provided anopportunity for RDD to actively engage inenhancing the flow of funds to that province.

In 2008, the RDD implemented/coordinated the loanschemes given in Table 1 below in respect of whicheither refinance was provided or interest subsidy waspaid to Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs).

21.1 Development of the Eastern Province

RDD made use of the opportunity arising from theimproved security situation in the Eastern Provincein 2008 to concentrate on activities aimed ataccelerating the development in that province. Asprogress of Tsunami rehabilitation activities in theEastern Province had been retarded earlier due tohostilities, the Susahana Phase II (Revolving Fund)scheme was extended to cover all Tsunami damagedMicro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) inthat province. Under this scheme, funds were madeavailable at a concessionary interest rate of 6 per cent.A sum of Rs. 500 million has been allotted for thispurpose out of recoveries of the original Susahanascheme. Further, credit for Tsunami rehabilitationis also available under the EIB- (Contract B) loanscheme. In addition to holding two press conferenceson banking facilities available for Eastern Provincedevelopment, RDD participated in 39 awarenessprogrammes for bank staff, public officials NGOsand the general public to educate them on specialcredit schemes available, for agriculture and otherdevelopment activities, at concessionary interestrates. RDD also targeted poor beneficiaries in theprovince under the PAMP-RF with the help ofidentified Participating Agencies (PAs) and PFIs. Thenumber of beneficiaries enrolled in the scheme inthe Eastern Province under PAMP-RF stood at 4,732as at end 2008. Of these, 1,517 beneficiaries weregranted loans to a total value of Rs. 52.1mn. tocommence income generating activities. In total,loans to the value of Rs. 432.7 mn. were disbursedunder the NCRCS, PAMP-RF, EIB, Susahana II andKrushi Navodaya Schemes in the Eastern Province.Further, under PAMP II, which will target 14 districtscomprising those in the Northern and EasternProvinces and districts bordering these twoprovinces, further funds for poverty alleviationactivities will be available to the Eastern Province.

21.2 Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Sector

The introduction of the Agro-Livestock DevelopmentLoan (ALDL) scheme in April 2008, was a majorstep taken during the year with regard to financingthe agriculture and animal husbandry sector. Thisscheme which was included in the Budget 2008 onthe recommendation of CBSL was mainly aimed atpromoting liquid milk production in the country. Inaddition to dairy farmers, loans are also available at

a concessionary rate for milk processing and cropprocessing industrial units which have entered intoForward Sales Contracts(FSCs) to purchase milkoutput/crop output of 1,000-10,000 dairy farmers/cultivators (Please see Table 1 for details on interestrates, scales of finance and eligible activities). Asalient feature of this loan scheme was that the releaseof funds was made conditional on adopting goodanimal husbandry practices.This loan schemefinances along the value chain of the milk industryby providing credit to dairy farmers as well as liquidmilk processors. Altogether 3,549 loans to a totalvalue of Rs. 880.8 mn.were registered1 under theALDL scheme in RDD during 2008.

With the sharp growth in the agriculture sectorexperienced during 2008, loan disbursement for cropcultivation under the NCRCS scheme expandedsignificantly. Altogether, loans to a total value of Rs1,571.6 mn. were granted in Maha 2007/08 for cropcultivation. This represents a 62 percent increase inthe value of loans granted compared to Maha 2006/07.
