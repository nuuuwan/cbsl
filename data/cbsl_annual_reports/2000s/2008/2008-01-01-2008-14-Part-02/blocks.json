The disturbances in the international financialmarket emphasised the importance of riskmanagement, internal controls, accountability in bankmanagement, corporate governance and compliance.In this regard, the BSD continued to promote soundrisk management systems by moving on to Basel II,preparing for adoption of International AccountingStandards, drafting guidelines for implementation ofan integrated risk management system in banks andamending existing Directions to strengthen the creditrisk management of banks. Further, to ensure smoothimplementation of the Directions on the CorporateGovernance of banks, transitional provisions wereintroduced during the year under review and asymposium was held for the board of directors ofbanks to emphasise their responsibilities andfiduciary duties.

TheSupreme Court upheld the principles in thedirections. The BSD issued an amendmentincorporating transitional provisions based onthe order of the Supreme Court on limits onthe age, length of service and number ofdirectorships that could be held by directors oflicensed banks.(c)Classification of loans and advances, incomerecognition and provisioning:A consolidated Direction was issued byincorporating several new provisions to theexisting ones with the objective of furtherstrengthening the credit risk management ofbanks. Accordingly, banks are required toclassify the credit facilities based on the periodand on the potential risk where fullrecoverability is in doubt and these criteria willbe applicable to both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items. Special classificationcriteria and provisioning requirements for creditcards were also introduced. Furthermore, aclassification policy based on borrower ratherthan by credit facility will be implemented fromJanuary 2010.(d)Establishment of bank branches:A new policy guideline was issued requiringbanks to establish at least two branches outsidethe Western Province for each new branchestablished in the Western Province. This willfacilitate the enhancement of economicdevelopment in areas outside the WesternProvince and contribute to achieving balancedregional development in the country, enhancingaccess to finance, financial inclusion andpromoting the savings habits, therebyincreasing economic activities in those regions.",

Accordingly, the examinationsof 16 banks were completed in 2008 through formaldiscussions with the management of the respectivebanks and submission of reports to the MonetaryBoard and 17 examinations are in the process ofcompletion.2.5Resolution Action on the Seylan Bank PLCThe attention of the Monetary Board was drawn toevents in the Golden Key Credit Card Company Ltd(a member of the Ceylinco Group), which resultedin difficulties being encountered by Seylan Bank PLCwith regard to deposit withdrawals and ensuingliquidity problems. Thereupon, the Monetary Board,with a view to addressing any potential danger tofinancial system stability, under Section 30 of theMLA, decided to discontinue the services of all thedirectors of Seylan Bank PLC effective from 29December 2008 and to appoint Bank of Ceylon tocarry on the business of Seylan Bank PLC. Throughsuch intervention, market confidence in Seylan Bankwas restored and the threat to the stability of thefinancial system was satisfactorily dealt with.2.6Investigations of hedging transactionsPursuant to media reports in early November 2008,the CBSL commenced investigations in connectionwith derivative transactions entered into by CeylonPetroleum Corporation (CPC) with five banks, viz.Standard Chartered Bank, Citibank NA, DeutscheBank AG, Commercial Bank of Ceylon and People\u2019sBank. In the meantime there were also twofundamental right petitions filed in the Supreme Courtin relation to these derivative transactions. TheSupreme Court directed the Monetary Board toconduct an investigation with regard to the impugnedtransactions and take action thereon, which resultedin widening the scope of the examination conductedby the BSD. Accordingly, five spot examinations onoil hedging transactions carried out by the five bankswere conducted and the reports were submitted tothe Monetary Board and the Supreme Court. Inaddition, examination findings were reported to theBribery Commission for further investigation, asdirected by the Supreme Court. On 16 December2008, the respective banks were informed not toproceed with or give affect to their transactions.",

The Weighted Average Returnon government securities for the year 2008 was 13.9per cent and yield varied between 10.4 per cent and15.3 percent depending on the maturity as at the endof 2008 (Table II-4). The capital gains and dividendsrealized from equity portfolio declined significantlyby 48 per cent to Rs. 225 million in 2008 from Rs.434 million in 2007 mainly due to depressed marketconditions.

The PDDcontinued the policy of re-opening the existingTreasury bond series limiting the introduction of newbond series to the market as much as possible toaddress high fragmentation of the domestic debtmarket.

Of this borrowing limit,Rs. 475 billion was expected to be financed fromdomestic sources while the balance Rs. 233 billionwas expected to mobilize through foreign sources.However, the global financial turmoil, existed duringthe later part of the year did not permit governmentto mobilize expected foreign commercial borrowingsand it had to be shifted to domestic borrowings.Accordingly, given domestic borrowings increasedby Rs.76 billion to Rs. 551 billion and gross foreignborrowings delivered by Rs.97 billion to Rs.136billion during 2008 while maintaining totalborrowings within the original gross borrowing target.In line with the high inflation experienced since 2007,domestic interest rates were remained high during2008. Therefore, PDD had to rely more on short termand medium term domestic debt instruments ratherthan longer-term debt instruments. Thus, Rs. 61.9billion was raised through Treasury bills and Rs.406.5 billion was raised through Treasury bondscompared with original target of Rs. 10 billion andRs. 362 billion respectively. In addition Rs. 36.1billion (US Dollar 335 million) borrowed throughSLDB in 2008 out of the target of Rs. 37.6 billion(US Dollar 360 million). The PDD did not issue anyRupee loan during 2008 continuing the strategy ofcutting down non-marketable debt stock from thedomestic debt stock.In 2008 the PDD attempted to ease the monthlybunching pressure in the Treasury bills by limitingissues of 91 day Treasury bills and increasing theissuance of 182 day and 364 day Treasury bills.Accordingly, issue of Treasury bills with 3 monthmaturities were reduced to 32 per cent of the totalTreasury bill issues in 2008 from 67 per cent in 2007,and increased issue of 12 month bills to 41 per centin 2008, from 14 per cent in 2007. However, thisstrategy could not be successfully adopted in theTreasury bonds and issue of Treasury bonds withmaturities above 3 year were only 29 per cent of totalissues due to the high yield rates prevailed for longterm maturities in the market.PDD was able to borrow only Rs. 39 billion from theexternal foreign commercial sources in 2008compared to the target of Rs. 67 billion, due to theglobal financial turmoil. Out of this, Rs.16 billionwas raised through a syndicated loan and Rs. 22.9billion raised by issuing Treasury bills and Treasurybonds to foreign investors. Although, governmentexpected Rs.166 billion for public investmentprogramme through Project/ Programme loans fromforeign concessional sources, only Rs.97 billion wererealized during the year 2008.",

In thearea of poverty alleviation, RDD continued with theimplementation of the Poverty Alleviation MicroFinance Project Revolving Fund (PAMP-RF) schemeand a special effort was made to target those inpoverty in the Eastern Province. Initial work wasalso completed on the Poverty Alleviation MicroFinance Project phase II (PAMP-II) which willmainly cover conflict affected districts. In April 2008,the RDD commenced implementing the Agro-Livestock Development Loan(ALDL) scheme whichwas announced in the Budget for 2008. In line withthe sharp increase in agriculture growth during theyear, there was a significant increase in demand forcredit under most agriculture-allied creditprogrammes. An impact assessment survey ofTsunami rehabilitation loan schemes was undertakenduring the third quarter of the year while preliminarywork in connection with a comprehensive impactassessment survey of PAMP was also completedduring the year.",

In Yala 2008, the value of loans granted was Rs.1,178.6mn. which represents an increase of 38.4percent when compared with Yala 2007. Meanwhile,the high growth experienced in the agriculture sectorand the volatility in commodity prices in 2008 servedas an impetus to increase the number of FSCs signed,as both producers and product purchasers sought tolimit their price risk exposure by using the FSCmechanism. The value of loans given for purchasingof produce under FSCs increased by 104 percent toRs 3,918.2 mn. in Maha 2007/08. The correspondingfigure for Yala 2008 was Rs. 3,866.0 mn. representingan increase of 52.0 percent over the previous Yala.Meanwhile, in the Krushi Navodaya Scheme underwhich PFIs granting medium and long term credit tomicro and small enterprises for agriculture relatedactivities at concessionary interest rates are eligiblefor interest subsidy payments, loans to the value ofRs. 552.3 mn. were disbursed in the first half of 2008.It is noteworthy that several banks were able todisburse a fair quantum of loans in the NorthernProvince as well under this scheme. In July 2008, inline with the high interest rate structure prevailingduring the year, the on-lending interest rate underthe NCRCS and Krushi Navodaya schemes wererevised upward to 12 percent with the Governmentmaking an interest subsidy payment of 8 percent andthereby making the effective rate of interest 20 percent for PFIs.
