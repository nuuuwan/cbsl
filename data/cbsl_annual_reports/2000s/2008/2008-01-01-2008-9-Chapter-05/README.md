5.1 OverviewP

ositive trends which Sri Lanka recorded relating to the country’s Balance of Payments (BOP) during the previous three years continued into the ﬁ rst three quarters of 2008 amidst challenging domestic and external environments, but this was signiﬁ cantly reversed thereafter, in the wake of the financial and economic crises that pervaded the world. The economic fundamentals of the country, including external sector variables, had been improving steadily until the end of the third quarter of 2008. Most of the external sector indicators; exports, worker remittances, balance of payments, short-term investments and external reserves, performed well above the original projections. Exports were growing at around 10 per cent until September 2008, despite many challenges such as the economic slowdown of major trading partners, the rising oil prices and costs of production, the relatively stable exchange rate, the higher interest rates and the uncertainty about renewal of concessions under the GSP+ scheme. The import expenditure grew sharply on account of the unprecedentedly higher petroleum and commodity prices in the international markets and consequently, the trade deﬁ cit widened by 88.1 per cent by end September, 2008. The widened trade deﬁ cit was partly offset by the increased private remittances, which grew well above 20 per cent throughout the ﬁ rst nine months, thereby softening the impact of the wider trade deﬁ cit on the current account. Net foreign short-term inﬂ ows to the government and the private sector peaked at US dollars 1,004 million by end September, 2008 and helped generate a surplus in the capital and financial account.

This was more than sufﬁ cient to ﬁ nance the higher current account deﬁ cit, generating a surplus of US dollars 173 million in the BOP by end September 2008.

As the year progressed, the entire external ﬁ nancial landscape changed, rapidly deteriorating the global economic growth prospects, which weakened the satisfactory external sector performance achieved by the country until the end of September 2008. The ﬁ nancial crisis triggered by the sub-prime mortgage lending in the United States, spilled over to other major markets, which in turn, resulted in a global ﬁ nancial turmoil that gradually seeped into the real sectors. The resulting slowdown in global growth, particularly in the advanced economies, led to a substantial decline in global demand for energy and other goods, which led the prices of petroleum and other commodities to plummet. The unexpectedly large swings in the international commodity prices have not only reduced the hefty import bill by a considerable amount, but have affected the demand for exports. The year ended with a trade deﬁ cit of US dollars 5,871 million, reﬂ ecting an increase of 60.6 per cent over 2007. The global ﬁ nancial turmoil and the resulting liquidity crunch and growing uncertainties signiﬁ cantly curtailed international trade and capital ﬂ ows. It also led to a sudden withdrawal of a large part of investment in Treasury bills and bonds by foreign investors, the hasty claims on short-term credit facilities, an acute drying-up of commercial financing and severe valuation losses arising from a sharp depreciation of major international currencies against the US dollar. Accordingly, the setback experienced in the external sector in the last

quarter exerted pressure on the country’s balance of payments. The surplus in the balance of payments, which had reached a peak of US dollars 515 million by end July 2008, turned into a deﬁ cit of US dollars 1.2 billion by end 2008 and external ofﬁ cial reserves excluding Asian Clearing Union (ACU) liabilities, declined by about 50 per cent to US dollars 1.75 billion from a record level of US dollars 3.56 billion in July 2008.

The exchange rate policy in 2008 focused more on the stability amidst unprecedented high volatility in global currency markets, while allowing for some gradual depreciation towards the end of the year to maintain external competitiveness. The exchange rate appreciated during the first four months and depreciated thereafter, the volatility, however, was contained by the Central Bank’s intervention in the domestic foreign exchange market. The capital account liberalisation was further promoted by permitting foreign investors to subscribe up to 10 per cent of the outstanding rupee denominated Treasury bills effective from May, 2008. Continuing with the declining trend observed in the past few years, the total external debt of the country as a percentage of GDP declined in 2008.

5.2 External Sector Policies and Institutional Support

The focus of government’s external trade strategy continued to be centred on export diversiﬁ cation, in terms of products and markets. It strived to increase exports by promoting exports of high value added components, encouraging productivity enhancing activities and the use of

effective marketing strategies in an increasingly competitive international arena, and exploring new markets, thereby making trade a strong contributor to the overall economic performance of the country. However, slow progress in export diversiﬁ cation, the significant decline in global demand, the increasing number of bilateral and multilateral trade agreements and trading blocs and the need to adhere to international standards and regulations posed signiﬁ cant challenges to Sri Lanka’s external trade.

Wide fluctuations in prices of essential consumer items in the world market necessitated temporary measures to reduce their impact on domestic prices. These included duty waivers on a few essential goods to contain inﬂ ationary pressures that persisted throughout the ﬁ rst half of the year. At the same time, in order to curtail pressures on the trade deﬁ cit to expand further, measures were taken to adjust tariffs and impose margin deposit

requirements on certain imports that were deemed to be non-essential. With the sharp decline in commodity prices in global markets towards the end of 2008, most duty measures were removed or reversed in order to recoup government’s tax revenue.

The ﬁ ve-band tariff structure of 0, 2.5, 6, 15 and 28 per cent, introduced in 2004, remained as the main trade policy instrument. The surcharge on customs duty was increased to 15 per cent from 10 per cent in 2008. Meanwhile, in order to contain the rise in the prices of essential food items, the customs duty, Value AddedTax (VAT), Port and Airport Development Levy (PAL), Social Responsibility Levy (SRL) and other charges applicable at the customs point for eleven selected essential food items, were replaced by a lower, single Special Commodity Levy. The average tariff rate, calculated based on total imports and customs duties decreased to 3.8 per cent in 2008 from 4.1 per cent in 2007, largely due to duty reductions granted on essential food items and duty waivers to public servants to import personal motor vehicles. However, there were other charges applicable to imports: a surcharge on customs duty, VAT, PAL, SRL, Excise Duty (on alcohol, tobacco products and vehicles) and cess on non-essential consumer items. Preferential tariffs offered on imports under bilateral and regional trade agreements continued to promote transparency and predictability in the external trading environment.

Sri Lanka continued to strive to enhance market access at the bilateral, regional and multilateral levels. At the multilateral level, the Doha Round of negotiations which has been the central mandate of the World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations since 2001, completed its eighth year without a successful conclusion. Market access negotiations under Agriculture and Non-Agriculture were foused on implementing an ambitious tariff reduction mechanism. With regard to Agriculture, Sri Lanka had to maintain a balance as a net food importing developing country and as a nation to support the vulnerable domestic agricultural sector. Under Non-Agriculture Market Access (NAMA), Sri

Lanka is concerned about its own tariff reductions as well as meaningful tariff reductions in key export markets. Negotiations under own tariff reductions were concluded with Sri Lanka committing to bind 80 per cent of its tariff lines at an average of 30 per cent. Accordingly, Sri Lanka retains sufﬁ cient policy space by excluding 20 per cent of its tariff lines from tariff reduction. The negotiations on trade rules, services, trade related intellectual property rights (TRIPS), trade facilitation, geographic indications, etc. also continued during 2008. The growing fears about protectionism amid the global economic downturn are expected to enhance the commitment of the members for an early and successful conclusion of the WTO negotiations.

The recent growth in Sri Lanka’s exports to the European Union was supported by the utilisation of concessions granted under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP+) scheme, which provides duty free market access to Sri Lankan exporters. The impact of the scheme is reﬂ ected in the expansion of the country’s market share, particularly in the UK, Italy and Belgium-Luxembourg as well as the product diversiﬁ cation in exports to the EU. The current GSP+ scheme lapsed at the end of 2008 and was renewed with some changes for a period of three years from 2009. Although Sri Lanka is included in the renewed scheme to receive preferential access for its exports to the EU, its eligibility is currently under review, to assess the degree of effective implementation of certain international conventions.

Sri Lanka’s final tariff liberalisation commitment under the Indo-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISLFTA) came into effect since November 2008 by deepening tariff preferences from 70 per cent to 100 per cent for 2,700 products. With this completion of the commitment, ISLFTA which came into effect from March, 2000 is now fully in force. Exports to India declined in 2008 mainly due to lower exports of copper, aluminium and related products. However, this does not undermine the vast potential in trade between the two countries, particularly at times when other major markets are affected by crisis.

The two nations are forging ahead with the negotiations for further liberalisation under the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA). The CEPA is expected to take the ISLFTA one stride further, towards the greater economic integration between the two countries by reducing the respective negative lists further and incorporating trade in services. Although, both countries concluded the discussions on the CEPA Framework Agreement, the ﬁ nalisation process was delayed in view of the stressing need for further consultations with all stakeholders to accommodate their views.

A similar comprehensive economic partnership agreement with Pakistan is being negotiated with a view to further expanding existing trade opportunities for both goods and services under the Paskistan-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (PSLFTA) implemented in June 2005. Two rounds of negotiations have already been concluded on the CEPA with Pakistan. Some issues pertaining to tariff concessions on auto sector products, crude coconut oil and bottle cooling machines were settled in June 2008. A substantial improvement in bilateral trade is recorded after the implementation of the PSLFTA, with the value of exports from Sri Lanka growing at 81 per cent while imports from Pakistan registering an increase of 78 per cent, by 2008 compared with the respective pre-agreement values. The fourth tariff reduction commitment of Sri Lanka in deepening its margin of preferences from 40 per cent to 60 per cent was implemented in November 2008. Once Pakistan implements its ﬁ nal tariff reduction commitment, 4,500 Sri Lankan products will enjoy duty free access to Pakistan.

The Trade Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) with USA provides a useful institutional arrangement for promoting closer co-operation between the two countries. It provides regular high level contacts among the trade ofﬁ cials where one could identify and address any barriers to trade between the two countries. A Ministerial level Annual Consultative Meeting was held in Washington in May 2008 and Sri Lanka primarily aimed at securing enhanced market access for its exports to USA, in particular apparel, and pursuing US cooperation in areas such as intellectual property rights.

With a view to strengthening the traditional trade ties with its neighbours, Sri Lanka, as an active member, consistently supported regional trade negotiations. These included the South Asia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA), the Asia-Paciﬁ c Trade Arrangement (APTA), the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMST-EC) and the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC) to ensure trade integration among the member countries is meaningful. Sri Lanka is also in the process of negotiating for enhanced trade and economic co-operation with Iran and China.

Measures taken by the Government and other institutions as enunciated in the Ten Year Horizon Development Framework of the Government have had an impact on the country’s trade patterns. Implementation of large scale projects on ports development, power plants, irrigation projects and water resources schemes, rural electriﬁ cation schemes and fertiliser subsidy programmes raised the volume of imports of investment and intermediate goods while some other initiatives to promote domestic production amidst wide ﬂ uctuations in prices of essential consumer goods, curtailed the volume of consumer goods imports by a certain

extent. An array of export development programmes were carried out by the Export Development Board (EDB) in 2008. Providing high quality value added agro products to the export market, and establishing export zones with the involvement of farmers in rural villages, so that the dividends generated from exports could be distributed among a wider section of the people, has been among the key initiatives taken by the EDB. The EDB, with the participation of the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI), has also initiated measures to formulate a Sri Lanka Standard for Organic Agriculture Production and Processing with the objective of supporting exporters of agricultural products to obtain international standards. The SLSI was also actively involved in the work related to the establishment of the South Asian Regional Standards Organisation to promote and undertake harmonisation of national standards of the SAARC countries with a view to removing the technical barriers to trade and facilitating the ﬂ ow of goods and services in the region.

Export Performance

Earnings from exports grew by 6.5 per cent to US dollars 8,137 million in 2008 from US dollars 7,640 million in 2007. Exports, which recorded a healthier growth of 12.7 per cent during the ﬁ rst eight months of the year, suffered as a result of the contraction in global demand towards the end of the year, leading to a decline in growth to 6.5 per cent by the end of the year. The agricultural exports, which grew by 23.1 per cent to US dollars 1,855 million in 2008, provided the major impetus to growth during the year. Agricultural exports contributed to nearly 70 per cent of this, which is largely due to the attractive prices in the international market.

Agricultural exports were led by the tea sector recording earnings of US dollars 1,271 million in 2008, mainly due to higher prices of tea. Sri Lanka’s tea prices reached record levels during the ﬁ rst nine months of 2008, in the wake of rising demand from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the other Middle Eastern countries, amidst uncertainties

of production in Kenya. The Middle Eastern nations and the CIS countries, which constituted the largest market for Sri Lanka’s tea exports, accounted for about 46 per cent and 23 per cent, respectively, of the total tea exports in 2008.

Tea prices at the Colombo Auction decreased since the third week of the September onwards, following intensiﬁ cation of the global ﬁ nancial turmoil. The situation was aggravated by the “wait and see” attitude taken by the buyers in anticipation of further price reductions. The high prices that prevailed during the ﬁ rst three quarters also compelled producers to supply lower quality tea to the auctions with a view to increasing quantity, resulting in a deterioration of the quality of the tea sold at the auction. The tea prices continued to plunge further to a level that the manufacturers and the green leaf suppliers could not even recover their costs and some stocks remained unsold at the auction. The government had to intervene in the market to stabilize the prices, by purchasing

the unsold tea through the Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB), which was re-sold in subsequent auctions in January 2009 when prices improved. Although the prices at the Colombo Auction deteriorated further towards the end of the year, they remained above those of other major Auction centres around the world. In order to ensure that the high quality associated with Ceylon Tea is maintained, the SLTB took measures to ensure that standards set out by them were adhered to by the green leaf suppliers as well as the tea manufacturers.

Minor agricultural products, which generated US dollars 287 million in 2008, are increasingly becoming an important source of export earnings for the country. Within the minor agricultural products, exports of fruits, vegetables and certain spices, such as cloves, recorded impressive growth in the ﬁ rst part of 2008 reﬂ ecting both price and quantity increases. Cinnamon and betel leaves, on the other hand, increased mainly due to the higher prices that prevailed in the international markets.

At US dollars 6,159 million, exports of industrial products recorded a modest growth of 3.2 per cent in 2008, partly due to the sluggish demand for apparel in the USA. This is attributed mainly to the heightened competition among several developing nations, the relatively higher cost of production, and the sharp depreciation of the euro and the UK pound against the US dollar, which have reduced the competitiveness of Sri Lanka’s exports to some extent. Industrial exports which grew by 4.8 per cent during the ﬁ rst three quarters declined by 1.3 per cent in the last quarter due to the lacklustre global demand as the crisis in the U.S. took on global proportions.

The apparel exports grew by a lower rate of 3.9 per cent to US dollars 3,469 million in 2008 compared to the growth rates of around 6 - 8 per cent achieved in the recent past. Nevertheless, the USA continued to be the largest single market for Sri Lanka’s exports, accounting for nearly 45 per cent of the garment exports. However, Sri Lanka’s share of apparel imports by the USA, declined in 2008.

The declining growth of the US market in recent years was offset to a certain extent by the sharp expansion in exports to the EU, the largest market for Sri Lanka’s exports of apparel. The growth in exports to the EU was supported by the GSP+ scheme, which provides duty free market access to Sri Lankan exporters. Amongst the members of the EU, the United Kingdom was the largest market for Sri Lanka, followed by Italy and Germany. Some manufacturers were affected by the uncertainty that prevailed towards the middle of the year regarding the future of the GSP+ scheme.

Earnings from most other categories of industrial exports such as petroleum products, rubber products and processed diamonds grew during the year 2008. With respect to the bunkering business, measures would have to be taken to increase the competitiveness and the efﬁ ciency of the service to consolidate its position in the South Asian region as the foremost ancillary service provider. Despite the progress made in the beginning of the year, the country’s exports of solid tyres and other products made from natural rubber were affected towards the latter part of the year by the cutbacks in production by large manufacturers, particulary the major automakers of the US and Japan. Despite the shortfall in demand for coloured gems for the jewellery industry, the demand for diamonds has shown an increase of 20.2 per cent in 2008. Although diamonds are not available in Sri Lanka, the country has established itself as a leading diamond processing centre with US dollars 418.7 million in export earnings, with about 6-8 per cent value addition. Sri Lanka has acquired a reputation for the high quality of diamond cutting in Antwerp where the most prestigious of diamond retailers reside. The Budget 2008 promoted the value addition to the gem industry by granting tax exemptions, allowing exporters to credit 50 per cent of foreign exchange earnings to foreign currency accounts for the importation of raw materials and charging a lower income tax of 2.5 per cent in place of the prevailing income tax.

Import Performance

Expenditure on imports grew by 24.0 per cent to US dollars 14,008 million compared to US dollars 11,296 million in 2007. The sharp increases in international commodity prices led imports to grow by 33.7 per cent during the ﬁ rst three quarters of 2008. Imports decelerated signiﬁ cantly thereafter with the changes in global economic conditions. The soaring commodity prices had an unfavourable impact on import expenditure until September 2008, when all major categories of imports grew very rapidly. Prices of most commodities, including petroleum, exhibited a series of historical highs during this period. The largest contribution to this growth came from intermediate goods, primarily due to the higher expenditures incurred on petroleum imports, whose share as a percentage of total imports had increased from 22 per cent in 2007 to 24 per cent in 2008. However, towards the end of year, the global economic crisis led to a substantial decline in global demand for petroleum and other commodities, which caused prices to plummet. The unexpected decline in prices led to a signiﬁ cant decline in import expenditure in the last quarter.

Petroleum imports, which grew by 61.4 per cent during the ﬁ rst three quarters, declined by 25.6 per cent in the fourth quarter due to the signiﬁ cant price swing in the international market. The resulting reduction in expenditure on petroleum and other imports led growth in imports to decelerate very rapidly, to record a ﬂ at rate in the last quarter.

Import expenditure incurred on intermediate goods increased by 28.0 per cent to US dollars 8,341 million, contributing about 67 per cent towards the import growth in 2008. Apart from petroleum, a noteworthy increase in expenditure on fertiliser imports was recorded in 2008, led by the higher prices that prevaliled in the international markets and the increased volumes generated by the fertiliser subsidy. Over 50 per cent of imported fertilisers comprised of Urea in 2008, which is used extensively by the paddy farmers in Sri Lanka. The favourable trends in agricultural prices have prompted farmers to cultivate marginal lands, adding pressure on the fertiliser requirement. Imports of textiles and clothing, of US dollars 1,702 million in 2008,

depicted a modest increase of 4.3 per cent over that of 2007, reﬂ ecting the slow growth of apparel exports.

Expenditure on consumer goods imports increased by 27.3 percent to US dollats 2,549 million in 2008. Within the consumer goods category, expenditure on food and drinks, increased signiﬁ cantly reﬂ ecting the high prices of wheat, milk, sugar and rice that prevailed before the commodity price bubble burst. Wheat import volumes declined marginally by 3.5 per cent in 2008. Import expenditure on motor vehicles recorded a higher growth of 16.2 per cent in 2008, which was attributed to the issuance of duty free vehicle import permits to public servants since 2007, which was subsequently withdrawn in April 2008.

The continued growth in the investment goods category, which recorded a growth of 10.9 per cent to US dollars 2,979 million in 2008, was led by increases in building materials. This could be attributed to the numerous large-scale infrastructure development projects undertaken across the country.

aid, increase in aid commitments also contributed to this outcome. However, towards the end of the year, the drop in external ﬁ nancing resulting from the ongoing credit crisis affected some infrastructure spending already earmarked by the government and the private sector. The lower international prices of capital goods in the latter part of the year, emanating from slowing down the pace of construction work in emerging markets such as China and India, and recessions in the developed countries are expected to continue for the greater part of 2009.

Trade Balance

The higher growth of expenditure on imports in 2008 relative to the modest growth in exports contributed to the substantial expansion in the trade deﬁ cit in 2008. The overall trade deﬁ cit widened by 60.6 per cent to US dollars 5,871 million in 2008 from US dollars 3,656 million in 2007.

Terms of Trade

Despite the favourable prices fetched by agricultural exports, the rise in international commodity prices, particularly petroleum, led the terms of trade to deteriorate signiﬁ cantly by 10.6 per cent in 2008.

The prices of exports grew by 6.1 per cent in 2008. The monthly average price of tea exported from Sri Lanka continued to rise and reached the highest ever recorded level of US dollars 4.28 per kilogram in September, 2008. However from end September, they took on a declining trend as the emergence of recession ended the price boom. The lower demand for Ceylon Tea emanated mainly from the income effects of the unexpected decline in oil prices on the major oil exporting countries, which are the main buyers of Ceylon Tea. Demand from the rest of the world was affected by the global recession, which aggravated the situation. The average price of tea exported from Sri Lanka fetched US dollars 3.98 per kilogram in 2008, compared to the average price of US dollars 3.29 per kilogram obtained in 2007. As with tea, natural rubber exports drew attractive prices during the ﬁ rst eight months of 2008. The highest export price of US dollars 3.24 per kilogram was recorded in July 2008 after which it was on a declining trend. The average export price of rubber, stood at US dollars 2.57 per kilogram in 2008, compared to the average price of US dollars 2.12 per kilogram in 2007. This remarkable increase reﬂ ects increasing crude oil prices which raised the cost of producing synthetic rubber and the strong demand for tyre production, especially from China,

the world largest rubber consumer and tyre exporter. However, the decline in price of oil later on in the year was reﬂ ected in lower synthetic rubber prices. The export prices of coconut and other agricultural products such as cinnamon, pepper, cloves and tobacco, also increased in 2008.

The prices of imports grew by 18.7 per cent in 2008. Driven by strong US consumption and soaring demand from China, India and other emerging economics, which have been the mainstay of recent global growth, commodity prices reached their higest levels in decades by 2008, as supply could not keep up with demand. The sharp increase in crude oiI prices spilled over into other primary commodities, including food and metals, the prices of which continued to rise sharply until mid 2008. Import price of crude oil increased signiﬁ cantly in line with the world market until July, 2008 to record the highest average import price of US dollars 134.34 per barrel and then declined sharply to US dollars 46.27 per barrel by December, 2008. The average import price of wheat was almost US $ 454.59 per metric ton in October, 2008, recording the highest level since the mid 1970s. Sugar prices too have increased in the

international market in 2008 compared to last year. Sugar production declined in 2008 as grain production displaced sugar in several countries. However, towards the end of 2008, prices suddenly collapsed in the face of a global ﬁ nancial crisis and economic downturn, delivering what many refer to as the most signiﬁ cant commodity price swing of the century.

Direction of Trade

The Western countries continued to be the main destination for Sri Lankan exports in 2008 while the Asian countries dominated Sri Lanka’s imports. While the USA and the UK remained the largest export destination countries, Singapore, Iran and China followed India as the foremost import-originating countries.

Among the major export destinations, the USA, the most important market for Sri Lanka, accounted for 23 per cent of exports. Exports to the USA declined by 5.1 per cent mainly due to the reduction in apparel exports. Apparel exports to the USA declined by 5.4 per cent in 2008. Exports to the European Union increased by 12.5 per cent in 2008. Within the European Union, exports to

the UK, which is also Sri Lanka’s second largest export destination, increased significantly by 7.1 per cent in 2008 while exports to Italy and Beligium-Luxembourg increased by 12.7 per cent and 6.3 per cent respectively. Exports to most countries in the euro region increased due to the tariff concessions given under the GSP+ scheme. India, which was the third largest export destination in 2007, moved down to the ﬁ fth position in 2008 in view of a 18.8 per cent decline in exports to India. Exports to India consisted mainly of vegetable fats, spices, rubber products and gems.

However, in terms of imports, India continued to be the largest source of imports, as imports from India grew by 31.9 per cent in 2008, accounting for nearly 25 per cent of Sri Lanka’s imports in 2008 compared to 23 per cent share of imports in 2007. Driven by higher imports, total trade with India exceeded US dollars 3.9 billion in 2008 highlighting the unique position India holds as the major trading partner country. The main imports from India included reﬁ ned petroleum products, sugar, motorcycles and auto-trishaws, copper wires, etc. Singapore and Iran followed as the second and third largest import source countries, reﬂ ecting growth rates of 11.1 per cent and 41.5 per cent, respectively in 2008. They account for 8.9 per cent and 8.5 per cent of total imports. Main imports from Singapore comprised of fertiliser, petroleum products and unwrought gold. The major import from Iran consisted of crude oil. China and Hong Kong also remain signiﬁ cant import source countries for Sri Lanka, holding shares of 7.8 per cent and 5.0 per cent of imports, respectively.

5.4 Trade in Services, Income, Transfers and Current Account Balance

Trade in Services

The surplus in trade in services widened significantly to US dollars 402 million in 2008 from US dollars 302 million in 2007. Transportation, telecommunication, computer and information technology services, construction and insurance services recorded surpluses in 2008. This improvement was partially offset by increase in deﬁ cits in other business services and travel.

Transportation Services

Transportation services, the largest category within the service sector, primarily led growth in the service sector. In spite of the slowdown in the global economic activities, the gross inﬂ ows on account of transportation services consisting of passenger fares, freight charges and other port related activities reported a remarkable growth of 22 per cent during the ﬁ rst nine months. However, this growth deteriorated in the last quarter mainly due to reduction of passenger trafﬁ c, passenger fares, cargo transportation and freight charges reﬂ ecting the rapid decline in global trade and broadening impact of the economic slowdown. The slowdown in the last quarter contained the inﬂ ows on account of transportation services to US dollars 999 million limiting the annual growth to 19.3 per cent in 2008. Meanwhile, outﬂ ows on account of transportation also increased at a rate of 17.3 per cent, in line with the higher passenger and freight charges that prevailed in the international markets during the most part of the year.

Gross inﬂ ows from passenger fares increased mainly due to the increase in air fares led by the fuel surcharges. However, towards the latter part of the year, the earnings on passenger fares declined

due to the contraction in the business travel along with reduction in travel for meetings and conventions due to the global economic slowdown. As remedial measures, the aviation industry is considering to enter into new product lines such as cargo, catering, ground handling, engineering services and training aircraft engineers to boost the slumped airline industry. Further, the operation of the newly built cargo handling terminal at the Bandaranaike International Airport by SriLankan AirLines will boost the cargo handling capacity, focusing on the growing Indian market.

Gross inflows on account of port-related activities increased as a result of increased transshipment attributable to the growing Indian economy and the improved service delivery at the Port of Colombo. The transshipment handling has recorded a growth of around 11.5 per cent during 2008. In order to sustain the growth in port-related activities and to successfully meet the future challenges from the competing ports in the region, Sri Lanka Ports Authority has improved its operations and has enhanced its productivity.

Travel and Tourism

The tourism industry remained sluggish during 2008 and the cumulative tourist arrivals declined by 11.2 per cent to 438,475 in 2008 compared to 494,008 arrivals in 2007. At the beginning of the year, arrivals were mainly affected by the travel advisories issued by some major tourist generating countries and as the year progressed, these factors were combined with the global

recession that resulted from ﬁ nancial market turmoil. Decreases in arrivals were recorded in respect of key markets of South Asia and Western Europe as well as other markets such as East Asia, North America and Australia during 2008. Increases in arrivals were recorded from the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Earnings from tourism declined to US dollars 342 million in 2008 from US dollars 385 million in 2007. In terms of purpose of visit, of the 438,475 tourist arrivals in 2008, majority of them (73.2 per cent) visited the country for holiday purposes, while 8.5 per cent came for business purposes. While 8.3 per cent indicated they were visiting friends and relatives, 2.6 per cent visited for religious and cultural purposes, and 1.3 per cent had come for conventions and meetings.

Amidst many challenges, the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority has taken several measures to promote tourism. The Marketing Strategy and Activity Plan for 2008-2010 was presented focusing on four key markets; India, UK, Russia and the Middle East, that have shown a growth potential. Several steps have been taken to revitalise the tourism industry in the Eastern Province. The government also offered a stimulus package in January 2009 to help revive the ailing tourism industry, which included rescheduling of loans, waiving off the fuel surcharge and the Economic Service Charge (ESC). The rapid slowdown of international tourism growth since mid-2008, may continue into 2009 reﬂ ecting the impact of the deterioration of the global economic situation. However, with the imminent end of the war against

terrorism after more than two decades, the tourism sector is expected to emerge as one of the thrust sectors of the economy in the medium-term.

Telecommunication and Information Technology Services

The net earnings from telecommunication services increased by around 42 per cent in 2008. However, with the increased utilisation of email, broad band internet, satellite TV and International Direct Dialling (IDD), outflows on account of telecommunication services have continued to grow albeit at a slower pace. In the face of intense competition from new entrants to the market, the reduction in international call charges by both mobile and ﬁ xed line telecommunication operators facilitated the growth of IDD usage.

Sri Lanka is emerging as a favourite offshore outsourcing destination for specialised services such as software development, Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES) including Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) and Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO) and other Information Technology (IT) related services. This sector has grown remarkably by around 31 per cent to US dollars 230 million in 2008 from US dollars 175 million in 2007. Although, the top markets for Sri Lanka’s software and ITES exports are Europe and North America, the potential exists to expand the market share in the African and Middle Eastern regions. Competitive operational costs, enhanced IT infrastructure facilities, availability of skilled workforce, price competitiveness due to concessions on service tax and the delivery of quality service facilitated the sustenance of the industry growth trend amidst the global ﬁ nancial turmoil. During 2008, several initiatives were taken to create a more conducive environment for IT and ITES sectors by further improving the IT infrastructure along with creating dedicated IT zones and appointing a Presidential Task Force on IT and English under the Ministry of Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion. The established IT Service Parks expanded its landscape through assisting and facilitating start-up companies by providing them with ‘incubation centres’, which have all the necessary infrastructure facilities required to start IT

or ITES operations, other than providing IT facilities for software development companies. Specialised training in the areas of KPO in both accountancy and law can be utilised to enhance the quality of ITES providers who are already equipped with well qualiﬁ ed professionals to exploit industry opportunities emerging with the ofﬁ cial declaration of the year 2009 as “The year of Information and Communication Technology and English”.

However, this sector is likely to experience a slowdown in the coming years due to the economic slowdown in the top markets, namely, United States and Europe. The significantly increasing lay-offs in these markets over the last few months and the protectionist measures that may be taken by the US Government to protect local production rather than off-shore outsourcing may however hinder the demand for ITES in Sri Lanka.

Inﬂ ows and Outﬂ ows of Income

The deﬁ cit in the income account widened to around US dollars 972 million during 2008 compared to the deﬁ cit of US dollars 358 million in 2007. The interest income from investment of ofﬁ cial reserves decreased by around 9 per cent to US dollars 96 million in 2008, mainly due to the lower global interest rates and gradual diminution of ofﬁ cial reserves during 2008. In addition, the higher appreciation of the US dollar against major currencies such as Euro and Sterling pound in 2008 and the decline in market value of securities resulted in valuation losses in the external reserves valued on the basis of mark-to-market in US dollar terms. Similarly, earnings from the foreign ﬁ nancial assets of the private sector including commercial banks decreased due to the lower global interest rates that prevailed in 2008. Meanwhile, outﬂ ows in the income account increased by around 17 per cent to US dollars 940 million mainly due to the substantial increase in repatriation of proﬁ ts and dividends of the foreign direct investment enterprises by foreign investors by around 35 per cent to US dollars 470 million. However, the repatriation of proﬁ ts and dividends includes offsetting entry for reinvestment of retained earnings by those investors for the expansion of existing operations of the foreign direct investment enterprises.

Current Transfers

Workers’ remittances grew at a higher rate of 16.7 per cent reaching US dollars 2,918 million in 2008. This increase was attributed mainly to the increase in the number of migrant workers leaving for foreign employment which increased by 16 per cent in 2008, the increase in the average wages of migrants in the Middle Eastern region due to the rise in income level of oil producing countries and the increased migration to high wage countries such as Korea, Malaysia and Singapore. Further, the deployment of Sri Lankan troops as UN Peacekeepers too have contributed to the boost in inward remittances. The new measures initiated by the commercial banks under the guidance of the Central Bank to mobilise more remittances through creation of awareness among migrants on the beneﬁ ts of transferring money through banking channels and posting additional bank ofﬁ cers in several major labour hiring countries to mobilise remittances also helped increase the remittances through formal channels in 2008.

Due to the prevailing global recession, there is a possibility that some of the high-wage earning Sri Lankan migrant workers will be made redundant. However, over 68 per cent of the Sri Lankan migrant workers are engaged as unskilled workers, while 24 per cent and 8 per cent of the workers are engaged in skilled and semi-skilled, and professional jobs respectively. Further, over 85 per cent of Sri Lankan migrant workers are spread over the Middle Eastern countries while only a small percentage serve in European and other Western countries which are in recession. Since only an insigniﬁ cant proportion is employed in the recession-affected countries while the majority is engaged in low wage earning occupations, a relatively steady inﬂ ow of workers’ remittances can be expected in 2009.

Current Account Balance

The current account deﬁ cit more than doubled to US dollars 3,775 million in 2008 from US dollars 1,401 million in 2007 due to increased trade deﬁ cit led by unprecedentedly high import expenditure. In terms of GDP, the current account

deﬁ cit deteriorated to 9.3 per cent of GDP in 2008 from 4.3 per cent of GDP in 2007. The historically high petroleum and commodity prices that prevailed during the ﬁ rst half of the year resulted in the trade balance to record a deﬁ cit of US dollars 5,871 million by end 2008. However, the robust workers’ remittances and worthy performance of the services sector helped contain the widening current account deﬁ cit. The high current account deﬁ cit reﬂ ects the high savings-investment gap of the country. Non-availability of adequate national savings for productive long-term investments suggests the need for substantial foreign capital, to achieve a consistently high rate of growth in the coming years.

5.5 Capital and Financial Flows and Balance of Payments

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)

FDI inﬂ ows reached the highest recorded level in 2008 mainly due to increased reinvestment of retained earnings. The increase in reinvestment of retained earnings as a strategic choice shows the confidence of the existing investors in the future economic prospects of the country with the current improvement in the security situation. In the midst of the global ﬁ nancial crisis many countries encountered difficulties in attracting new FDI. Hence, the increase in reinvestment of retained earnings amidst the global economic crisis situation particularly shows heightened conﬁ dence about the prospects of the Sri Lankan economy. As a result, the gross FDI inﬂ ows including the foreign loans obtained by the BOI approved companies reached a record level of US dollars 889 million in 2008

compared to US dollars 734 million in 2007. FDI inﬂ ows in 2008 consisted of equity capital of US dollars 131 million, loans and advances of US dollars 110 million by the shareholders, intra-company borrowings of US dollars 101 million, foreign loans of US dollars 137 million and the reinvestment of retained earnings of US dollars 410 million by the existing companies. Meanwhile, FDI outﬂ ows increased to US dollars 62 million in 2008 from US dollars 55 million in 2007 as a few local companies also invested abroad, during the year.

Foreign investment commitments approved by BOI increased during 2008 despite the modest decline in the number of projects approved. Most of the projects approved were large scale projects engaged in telecommunication and manufacturing sectors. The highest FDI inﬂ ows were from Malaysia, amounting to US dollars 150 million, followed by India amounting to US dollars 126 million.

The long-term nature of the FDI ﬂ ows reﬂ ects the importance of FDI over the other short-term ﬁ nancial ﬂ ows of a speculative nature. In contrast to FDI, short-term ﬁ nancial ﬂ ows are volatile and subject to the risk of sudden withdrawal especially during a crisis situation. Therefore, it is imperative that a more conducive environment for investment is created by providing required infrastructure facilities, establishment of property rights, faster allocation of lands for new investments, transparent licensing procedures, a fast dispute settlement system and greater labour mobility to attract a higher level of FDI.

Foreign Capital to the Government

Medium and Long-Term

Foreign inﬂ ows to the government consisting of both loans and grants decreased in 2008, mainly due to the lack of counterpart funds available for externally funded projects due to the global ﬁ nancial crisis. Though some commercial loans did not materialise as a result of the intensifying global ﬁ nancial crisis towards the end of the year, the government was able to mobilise US dollars 1.4 billion worth of loans and grants during 2008 as compared to US dollars 1.6 billion in 2007 which included the

sovereign bond proceeds of US dollars 500 million. During the year, the total of long and medium term loan inﬂ ows to the government amounted to US dollars 1,059 million compared to US dollars 1,290 million in 2007. Of the total loan receipts in 2008, 604 million (57 per cent) was received on concessional terms while US dollars 455 million (43 per cent) was received on non-concessional or commercial terms.

The concessional loan inﬂ ows were mostly directed towards the implementation of infrastructure projects such as expansion of the Colombo Port, construction of Southern Expressway and new Hambantota Port etc. Despite the faster implementation of major projects, the foreign aid utilisation rate1 decreased marginally in 2008 to 20.5 per cent from 20.6 per cent in 2007, due to an increase in new aid commitments for new projects during the year. Meanwhile, long-term loan repayments by the government increased by 30.6 per cent to US dollars 807 million in 2008 mainly due to the repayment of goverment’s commercial borrowings and the debts deferred in 2005 by Paris Club members, which need to be settled in seven instalments commencing from 2006. The total grants, consisting both of a current and capital nature, increased to US dollars 289 million in 2008 from US dollars 277 million in 2007. The government continued to receive a substantial amount of grants for the reconstruction of infrastructure damaged by the tsunami during 2008 as well.

Short-Term

Short-term net inflow on account of the government Treasury bills and bonds by foreigners reached its peak level of US dollars 185 million by end September 2008. However, with the intensiﬁ cation of the global ﬁ nancial crisis, the inﬂ ows recorded till end September 2008, suddenly reversed and by end 2008 turned into a net outﬂ ow of US dollars 213 million, due to the withdrawals by investors. Short-term net outﬂ ows on account of the government Treasury bonds by foreigners amounted to US dollar 264 million in 2008 compared to the net inﬂ ows of US dollars 372 million recorded in 2007. As part of further liberalisation of the capital account, the government permitted foreigners to invest up to a maximum of 10 per cent of the value of outstanding Treasury bills effective from May 2008. As a result of the liberalisation of Treasury bills market, government received a net inﬂ ow of US dollars 51 million on account of Treasury bills during 2008. However, investments in Treasury bills and bonds which are classiﬁ ed as short-term capital are

much susceptible to volatile global ﬁ nancial outlook, and the intensiﬁ cation of ﬁ nancial crisis in September 2008 fuelled the rapid liquidation and repatriation of investment in Treasury bills and bonds. A total of US dollars 430 million of investments in Treasury bills and bonds were withdrawn during the period October to December 2008. In order to meet sudden foreign exchange requirement arising from liquidation of these investments and to create conﬁ dence among the investors, the Central Bank utilised the Sinking Fund that was created for such a purpose to facilitate the withdrawal of funds by foreign investors, without exerting an undue pressure on the domestic foreign exchange market.

Foreign Capital to the Private Sector and Public Corporations

Long-Term

Long-term loan inﬂ ows to the private sector increased by 33.2 per cent to US dollars 265 million in 2008. Several private sector enterprises including a few BOI enterprises, particularly in power and energy, telecommunications and ﬁ nance sectors obtained foreign loans to ﬁ nance the expansion of their businesses as the domestic interest rates were relatively high in 2008.

Short-Term

The total net short-term capital inﬂ ows which consist of portfolio investments, private short-term credits and changes in commercial bank assets and liabilities, increased substantially to US dollars 679 million in 2008, compared to US dollars 205 million recorded in 2007, largely due to the extension of the Iranian line of credit to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) for petroleum imports. During 2008, CPC received net trade credits of US dollars 601 million including US dollars 381 million of Iranian line of credit.

Despite a record level of gross inflow of US dollars 548 million received into the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), the net portfolio investment inﬂ ows declined to US dollars 60 million in 2008 as compared to US dollars 101 million in 2007. The companies in the automobile,

banking and ﬁ nance, insurance and telecom sectors attracted higher foreign investment. The outright sale of major shareholding of Associated Motorways PLC (AMW) and the selling of Nippon Telecommunication and Telegraphs Ltd.’s (NTT) stake in Sri Lanka Telecom Ltd. (SLT) and the minority shareholders’ stake in SLT to the Global Telecommunications Holdings (GTH) attracted higher inﬂ ows to CSE. Gross outﬂ ows also increased to US dollars 488 million mainly due to the sale of NTT’s stake in SLT.

Net foreign assets of commercial banks decreased by US dollars 210 million in 2008, mainly due to the conversion of foreign currency assets to domestic assets such as Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDB). Meanwhile, net liabilities of commercial banks decreased by US dollars 185 million in 2008 due to the decrease in foreign currency deposits both in Domestic Banking Units (DBUs) and Offshore Banking Units (OBUs).

Balance of Payments

BOP turned into a deﬁ cit in 2008, after recording surpluses continuously in the preceding three years. Due to the favourable external environment, BOP recorded a surplus during the first three quarters of 2008 and recorded a surplus of US dollars 515 million by end July 2008. However, the intensiﬁ cation of the global ﬁ nancial crisis in September

2008, adversely affected the satisfactory developments in the external sector. It led to the sudden withdrawal of investment in Treasury bills and bonds by foreign investors, the hasty claims on short-term credit facilities, the acute drying-up of commercial ﬁ nancing and severe valuation losses arising from the sharp depreciation of major international currencies against the US dollar. As a result, by end 2008, BOP turned into a deﬁ cit of US dollars 1,225 million.

External Reserves

During the greater part of the first nine months of 2008, the gross ofﬁ cial reserves were maintained at a comfortable level equivalent to well over 3 months of imports. External ofﬁ cial reserves excluding ACU liabilities rose to its highest

ever level of US dollars 3,558 million in July 2008 which was the equivalent of 3.2 months of imports. Since then, reserves declined gradually as total outﬂ ows were higher than inﬂ ows with the intensiﬁ cation of the global ﬁ nancial crisis. By end 2008, the gross ofﬁ cial reserves, with and without ACU payments, declined to US dollars 2,561 million and US dollars 1,753 million respectively. Accordingly, by end 2008, reserves with and without ACU were equivalent to 2.2 months and 1.5 months of imports respectively. The reserve adequacy as measured by the ratio of gross ofﬁ cial reserves to short-term liabilities also declined to 45 per cent by end 2008 from 79 per cent at end 2007 mainly due to the reduction in reserves. The total external reserves of the country including ACU receipts also declined to US dollars 3,799 million.

The Central Bank took several measures to increase the reserve level of the country in 2009. The Central Bank has been in negotiation with three countries for currency SWAP arrangements. Under such arrangements the Central Bank has so far in 2009 received US dollars 200 million. In addition, several other steps have also been taken to boost the reserves. Promotion of investments in Treasury bills and bonds among the Sri Lankan Diaspora and the introduction of 20 per cent bonus interest on interest earned on NRFC and RFC accounts to encourage a higher level of inﬂ ows into those accounts were some of such initiatives.

Further, in response to an offer of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to support Sri Lanka during the current global ﬁ nancial crisis, the government has sought a Stand-by Arrangement facility from IMF. Such support from IMF is for BOP purposes and the funds would be used to rebuild foreign reserves. It is expected that such support would enhance the assistance from other development partners as well as signiﬁ cantly improve international investors’ conﬁ dence on Sri Lanka.

per cent as a percentage of GDP in 2008 from 43.2 per cent in 2007. In US dollar terms, the total external debt increased by around 8 per cent to US dollars 15,107 million in 2008 basically driven by large short-term debt of CPC and other trade credits. Of the total external debt outstanding, 37.2 per cent was denominated in SDR, 31.1 per cent in Japanese Yen and 19.6 per cent in US dollars. The total external debt and liabilities, which consist of total external debt and banking sector external liabilities, decreased as a percentage of GDP in 2008 to 43.7 per cent from 51 per cent in 2007. The banking sector external liabilities as a percentage of GDP decreased to 6.6 per cent though in absolute terms it increased by 7.1 per cent to US dollars 2,669 million by end 2008, mainly due to the increase in ACU liabilities.

The government debt continued to account for a major share of external debt. From the total medium and long-term debt, the government debt accounted for 92 per cent, while the remaining share represented borrowings of the private sector and public corporations, and debt obligations to IMF. Out of the total government external debt, the concessional debt accounted for about 86 per cent. The elevation of the country to the lower middle income status has reduced the availability of concessional loans from multinational ﬁ nancial institutions, compelling the government to seek non-concessional loans to ﬁ nance its development projects. However, the government maintained its non-concessional debt stock at a low risk level reducing the government’s burden on debt.

based debt moratorium in 2005 and the increasing debt servicing cost of the government’s commercial borrowings in 2008 were the major reasons for the increase in the country’s external debt service payments. The debt service ratios, which measure the country’s capacity to service its external debt still remain at a comfortable level mainly due to the high share of concessional loans with longer repayment periods supported by continued growth in earnings from exports of goods and services.

5.7 Exchange Rate Regime and Exchange Rate Movements

The Central Bank’s exchange rate policy in 2008 mainly focused on stability amidst unprecedented high volatility in the global currency markets, while allowing gradual depreciation to maintain external competitiveness. With the successful completion of Sri Lanka’s debut international sovereign bond issue in October 2007, the rupee

gradually appreciated against the US dollar till early 2008. It appreciated from Rs. 114 per US dollar in October 2007 to Rs. 107 per US dollar in March 2008. The rupee further strengthened with the announcement of an increase in foreign investment in Treasury bonds in December 2007 from 5 per cent to 10 per cent of the total outstanding Treasury bonds, and the weakening of the US dollar against major currencies during the ﬁ rst half of 2008. Further, with the opening of the Treasury bills market to foreign

but excessive volatility was prevented through careful intervention. Accordingly, the Central Bank supplied US dollars 1,014 million to the foreign exchange market during the last quarter of 2008. On that basis, the total supply of foreign exchange by the Central Bank during 2008 amounted to US dollars 1,532 million.

As a result, by end 2008 the depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar was around 3.91 per cent as compared to a depreciation of around 0.93 per cent in 2007. At the same time, the rupee appreciated signiﬁ cantly against the Sterling pound (32.99 per cent), Indian rupee (17.54 per cent) and moderately against the Euro (0.51 per cent), while it depreciated against the Japanese Yen (22.44 per cent).

Nominal and Real Effective Exchange Rates

During 2008, both the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) and the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) continued to appreciate at a faster rate than in 2007. Reﬂ ecting a nominal appreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee against most of the major currencies in the currency baskets, NEER of the Sri Lanka rupee, based on both the 5 currency

investors in May 2008 allowing them to invest up to 10 per cent of the outstanding Treasury bills, there was a continued pressure for the rupee to appreciate.

To mitigate excessive volatility in the foreign exchange market and to ensure that the competitiveness of the export sector is unaffected by an undue appreciation of the rupee, the Central Bank regularly absorbed foreign exchange from the domestic foreign exchange market, thereby strengthening its reserve position. Accordingly, the Central Bank’s intervention in the market helped stabilize the exchange rate around Rs. 108 per US dollar level and by end October, the Central Bank had absorbed US dollars 622 million from the domestic foreign exchange market. With the intensiﬁ cation of the ﬁ nancial crisis, heavy outﬂ ows of foreign exchange due to the repatriation of short- term investments in Treasury bills and bonds and payments of high valued petroleum bills exerted heavy pressure on the exchange rate to depreciate in the last quarter of 2008. Besides, by end October 2008, considering the sharp decline in export prices, risks of lower export demand and the sharp appreciation of the US dollar against most major international currencies, the Central Bank allowed greater ﬂ exibility in the exchange rate,

FDI. The higher interest rate differential resulted from lower international interest rates compared to domestic market interest rates and the relatively stable exchange rate supplemented in attracting foreign investments into the domestic Treasury bills and bonds markets in early part of the year. However, towards the latter part of the year, sudden liquidation of short-term investments with the intensiﬁ cation of the ﬁ nancial crisis and expectation of further depreciation of the rupee prompted the Central Bank to adapt precautionary and prudential measures to prevent speculative movements in the exchange rate and ensure stabilisation in the foreign exchange market. These measures contained the level of activity in the domestic foreign exchange market to a certain extent.

During the year, the Central Bank intervened in both sides of the market, which helped prevent erratic and undue movements in the exchange rates. The Central Bank absorbed a total of US dollars 656 million from the inter-bank market and supplied US dollars 1,532 million during 2008, resulting in a net supply of US dollars 876 million in 2008 as compared to a net supply of US dollars 123 million in 2007.
