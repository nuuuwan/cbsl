    "text": "ositive trends which Sri Lanka recorded relating to the country\u2019s Balance of Payments (BOP) during the previous three years continued into the \ufb01 rst three quarters of 2008 amidst challenging domestic and external environments, but this was signi\ufb01 cantly reversed thereafter, in the wake of the financial and economic crises that pervaded the world. The economic fundamentals of the country, including external sector variables, had been improving steadily until the end of the third quarter of 2008. Most of the external sector indicators; exports, worker remittances, balance of payments, short-term investments and external reserves, performed well above the original projections. Exports were growing at around 10 per cent until September 2008, despite many challenges such as the economic slowdown of major trading partners, the rising oil prices and costs of production, the relatively stable exchange rate, the higher interest rates and the uncertainty about renewal of concessions under the GSP+ scheme. The import expenditure grew sharply on account of the unprecedentedly higher petroleum and commodity prices in the international markets and consequently, the trade de\ufb01 cit widened by 88.1 per cent by end September, 2008. The widened trade de\ufb01 cit was partly offset by the increased private remittances, which grew well above 20 per cent throughout the \ufb01 rst nine months, thereby softening the impact of the wider trade de\ufb01 cit on the current account. Net foreign short-term in\ufb02 ows to the government and the private sector peaked at US dollars 1,004 million by end September, 2008 and helped generate a surplus in the capital and financial account.",

    "text": "As the year progressed, the entire external \ufb01 nancial landscape changed, rapidly deteriorating the global economic growth prospects, which weakened the satisfactory external sector performance achieved by the country until the end of September 2008. The \ufb01 nancial crisis triggered by the sub-prime mortgage lending in the United States, spilled over to other major markets, which in turn, resulted in a global \ufb01 nancial turmoil that gradually seeped into the real sectors. The resulting slowdown in global growth, particularly in the advanced economies, led to a substantial decline in global demand for energy and other goods, which led the prices of petroleum and other commodities to plummet. The unexpectedly large swings in the international commodity prices have not only reduced the hefty import bill by a considerable amount, but have affected the demand for exports. The year ended with a trade de\ufb01 cit of US dollars 5,871 million, re\ufb02 ecting an increase of 60.6 per cent over 2007. The global \ufb01 nancial turmoil and the resulting liquidity crunch and growing uncertainties signi\ufb01 cantly curtailed international trade and capital \ufb02 ows. It also led to a sudden withdrawal of a large part of investment in Treasury bills and bonds by foreign investors, the hasty claims on short-term credit facilities, an acute drying-up of commercial financing and severe valuation losses arising from a sharp depreciation of major international currencies against the US dollar. Accordingly, the setback experienced in the external sector in the last",

The capital account liberalisation was further promoted by permitting foreign investors to subscribe up to 10 per cent of the outstanding rupee denominated Treasury bills effective from May, 2008.

Meanwhile, in order to contain the rise in the prices of essential food items, the customs duty, Value AddedTax (VAT), Port and Airport Development Levy (PAL), Social Responsibility Levy (SRL) and other charges applicable at the customs point for eleven selected essential food items, were replaced by a lower, single Special Commodity Levy. The average tariff rate, calculated based on total imports and customs duties decreased to 3.8 per cent in 2008 from 4.1 per cent in 2007, largely due to duty reductions granted on essential food items and duty waivers to public servants to import personal motor vehicles. However, there were other charges applicable to imports: a surcharge on customs duty, VAT, PAL, SRL, Excise Duty (on alcohol, tobacco products and vehicles) and cess on non-essential consumer items.

Negotiations under own tariff reductions were concluded with Sri Lanka committing to bind 80 per cent of its tariff lines at an average of 30 per cent. Accordingly, Sri Lanka retains suf\ufb01 cient policy space by excluding 20 per cent of its tariff lines from tariff reduction. The negotiations on trade rules, services, trade related intellectual property rights (TRIPS), trade facilitation, geographic indications, etc. also continued during 2008. The growing fears about protectionism amid the global economic downturn are expected to enhance the commitment of the members for an early and successful conclusion of the WTO negotiations.",

The current GSP+ scheme lapsed at the end of 2008 and was renewed with some changes for a period of three years from 2009. Although Sri Lanka is included in the renewed scheme to receive preferential access for its exports to the EU, its eligibility is currently under review, to assess the degree of effective implementation of certain international conventions.",

With this completion of the commitment, ISLFTA which came into effect from March, 2000 is now fully in force.

Some issues pertaining to tariff concessions on auto sector products, crude coconut oil and bottle cooling machines were settled in June 2008. A substantial improvement in bilateral trade is recorded after the implementation of the PSLFTA, with the value of exports from Sri Lanka growing at 81 per cent while imports from Pakistan registering an increase of 78 per cent, by 2008 compared with the respective pre-agreement values. The fourth tariff reduction commitment of Sri Lanka in deepening its margin of preferences from 40 per cent to 60 per cent was implemented in November 2008.

Providing high quality value added agro products to the export market, and establishing export zones with the involvement of farmers in rural villages, so that the dividends generated from exports could be distributed among a wider section of the people, has been among the key initiatives taken by the EDB. The EDB, with the participation of the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI), has also initiated measures to formulate a Sri Lanka Standard for Organic Agriculture Production and Processing with the objective of supporting exporters of agricultural products to obtain international standards. The SLSI was also actively involved in the work related to the establishment of the South Asian Regional Standards Organisation to promote and undertake harmonisation of national standards of the SAARC countries with a view to removing the technical barriers to trade and facilitating the \ufb02 ow of goods and services in the region.",

Amongst the members of the EU, the United Kingdom was the largest market for Sri Lanka, followed by Italy and Germany.

With respect to the bunkering business, measures would have to be taken to increase the competitiveness and the ef\ufb01 ciency of the service to consolidate its position in the South Asian region as the foremost ancillary service provider. Despite the progress made in the beginning of the year, the country\u2019s exports of solid tyres and other products made from natural rubber were affected towards the latter part of the year by the cutbacks in production by large manufacturers, particulary the major automakers of the US and Japan. Despite the shortfall in demand for coloured gems for the jewellery industry, the demand for diamonds has shown an increase of 20.2 per cent in 2008. Although diamonds are not available in Sri Lanka, the country has established itself as a leading diamond processing centre with US dollars 418.7 million in export earnings, with about 6-8 per cent value addition. Sri Lanka has acquired a reputation for the high quality of diamond cutting in Antwerp where the most prestigious of diamond retailers reside. The Budget 2008 promoted the value addition to the gem industry by granting tax exemptions, allowing exporters to credit 50 per cent of foreign exchange earnings to foreign currency accounts for the importation of raw materials and charging a lower income tax of 2.5 per cent in place of the prevailing income tax.",

    "text": "Expenditure on imports grew by 24.0 per cent to US dollars 14,008 million compared to US dollars 11,296 million in 2007. The sharp increases in international commodity prices led imports to grow by 33.7 per cent during the \ufb01 rst three quarters of 2008. Imports decelerated signi\ufb01 cantly thereafter with the changes in global economic conditions. The soaring commodity prices had an unfavourable impact on import expenditure until September 2008, when all major categories of imports grew very rapidly. Prices of most commodities, including petroleum, exhibited a series of historical highs during this period. The largest contribution to this growth came from intermediate goods, primarily due to the higher expenditures incurred on petroleum imports, whose share as a percentage of total imports had increased from 22 per cent in 2007 to 24 per cent in 2008. However, towards the end of year, the global economic crisis led to a substantial decline in global demand for petroleum and other commodities, which caused prices to plummet. The unexpected decline in prices led to a signi\ufb01 cant decline in import expenditure in the last quarter.",

However from end September, they took on a declining trend as the emergence of recession ended the price boom. The lower demand for Ceylon Tea emanated mainly from the income effects of the unexpected decline in oil prices on the major oil exporting countries, which are the main buyers of Ceylon Tea. Demand from the rest of the world was affected by the global recession, which aggravated the situation. The average price of tea exported from Sri Lanka fetched US dollars 3.98 per kilogram in 2008, compared to the average price of US dollars 3.29 per kilogram obtained in 2007. As with tea, natural rubber exports drew attractive prices during the \ufb01 rst eight months of 2008. The highest export price of US dollars 3.24 per kilogram was recorded in July 2008 after which it was on a declining trend. The average export price of rubber, stood at US dollars 2.57 per kilogram in 2008, compared to the average price of US dollars 2.12 per kilogram in 2007. This remarkable increase re\ufb02 ects increasing crude oil prices which raised the cost of producing synthetic rubber and the strong demand for tyre production, especially from China,",

The interest income from investment of of\ufb01 cial reserves decreased by around 9 per cent to US dollars 96 million in 2008, mainly due to the lower global interest rates and gradual diminution of of\ufb01 cial reserves during 2008. In addition, the higher appreciation of the US dollar against major currencies such as Euro and Sterling pound in 2008 and the decline in market value of securities resulted in valuation losses in the external reserves valued on the basis of mark-to-market in US dollar terms. Similarly, earnings from the foreign \ufb01 nancial assets of the private sector including commercial banks decreased due to the lower global interest rates that prevailed in 2008. Meanwhile, out\ufb02 ows in the income account increased by around 17 per cent to US dollars 940 million mainly due to the substantial increase in repatriation of pro\ufb01 ts and dividends of the foreign direct investment enterprises by foreign investors by around 35 per cent to US dollars 470 million. However, the repatriation of pro\ufb01 ts and dividends includes offsetting entry for reinvestment of retained earnings by those investors for the expansion of existing operations of the foreign direct investment enterprises.",

This increase was attributed mainly to the increase in the number of migrant workers leaving for foreign employment which increased by 16 per cent in 2008, the increase in the average wages of migrants in the Middle Eastern region due to the rise in income level of oil producing countries and the increased migration to high wage countries such as Korea, Malaysia and Singapore. Further, the deployment of Sri Lankan troops as UN Peacekeepers too have contributed to the boost in inward remittances. The new measures initiated by the commercial banks under the guidance of the Central Bank to mobilise more remittances through creation of awareness among migrants on the bene\ufb01 ts of transferring money through banking channels and posting additional bank of\ufb01 cers in several major labour hiring countries to mobilise remittances also helped increase the remittances through formal channels in 2008.",

Further, over 85 per cent of Sri Lankan migrant workers are spread over the Middle Eastern countries while only a small percentage serve in European and other Western countries which are in recession. Since only an insigni\ufb01 cant proportion is employed in the recession-affected countries while the majority is engaged in low wage earning occupations, a relatively steady in\ufb02 ow of workers\u2019 remittances can be expected in 2009.",

The higher interest rate differential resulted from lower international interest rates compared to domestic market interest rates and the relatively stable exchange rate supplemented in attracting foreign investments into the domestic Treasury bills and bonds markets in early part of the year. However, towards the latter part of the year, sudden liquidation of short-term investments with the intensi\ufb01 cation of the \ufb01 nancial crisis and expectation of further depreciation of the rupee prompted the Central Bank to adapt precautionary and prudential measures to prevent speculative movements in the exchange rate and ensure stabilisation in the foreign exchange market. These measures contained the level of activity in the domestic foreign exchange market to a certain extent.",
