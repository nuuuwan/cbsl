In this regard, the views of the Monetary Policy Consultative Committee (MPCC) were also taken into consideration by the Bank, in formulating its monetary policy.",

The expansion in NFA during the \ufb01 rst three quarters was mainly due to the Central Bank\u2019s purchases of proceeds to the government from a syndicated loan of US dollars 150 million obtained from an overseas bank, loans obtained from Offshore Banking Units (OBUs) amounting to US dollars 75 million, the net sale of SLDBs amounting to US dollars 25 million, the disbursement of scheduled foreign loans and grants; and the absorption of excess foreign exchange from the market arising from the sale of Treasury bills and bonds to foreign investors. NDA of the Central Bank declined substantially during this period as the Bank absorbed surplus liquidity from the market by selling Treasury bills out of its holdings through open market operations, to maintain reserve money along the planned path. By June 2008, the Bank\u2019s Treasury bill holdings declined to a near zero level, and the Central Bank had to issue its own securities to absorb excess liquidity. During the last quarter however, the NFA of the Central Bank declined notably due to the repercussions of the global \ufb01 nancial crisis and resulting liquidity constraints. This was largely a result of an out\ufb02 ow of foreign investments in Treasury bills and Treasury bonds, the settlement of foreign loans and the provision of foreign exchange to the market, mainly to settle Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) bills in order to avoid undue pressure on the exchange rate arising from the withdrawal of suppliers\u2019 credit facilities",

The annual average growth in broad money was 12.1 per cent. The expansion in broad money was largely on account of the increase in the growth of quasi money, which consists of both time and savings deposits held by the public. Quasi money expanded by 9.5 per cent during the year as a result of an expansion in rupee denominated term deposits. Foreign currency deposits, which grew at a healthy rate through 2007 and the \ufb01 rst half of 2008 reversed this trend since July. As a result, foreign currency deposits declined by around 9 per cent year-on-year in dollar terms, in 2008. This is attributable to the drop of around 13 per cent in non-resident foreign currency (NRFC) accounts, which account for two thirds of foreign currency deposits.

This increase is accounted for by an increase in the holdings of Treasury bills by the Central Bank as well as provisional advances to the government, which together accounted for Rs. 116 billion; and Rs.82 billion provided by commercial banks. The Central Bank\u2019s purchases of Treasury bills in the primary and secondary markets to offset the liquidity shortfall in the money market was a key reason for the increase in its holding of Treasury bills during the year. The higher borrowings from commercial banks are re\ufb02 ected in the increases in their holding of Treasury bills and Treasury bonds, SLDBs and the government overdraft balance within their portfolio. The overrun in the government\u2019s domestic credit utilisation is predominantly due to the non-realisation of expected foreign in\ufb02 ows, the dif\ufb01 culties in raising funds abroad due to the turbulent conditions in international financial markets, and the lower revenue collection.",

However, call rates increased when market liquidity was short, particularly during much of the period from September to November 2008, pushing up the weighted average call money rate to a range of around 17 \u2013 19 per cent. They moved in a range of around 13 \u2013 15 per cent when the money market had surplus liquidity. The reduction in the SRR and the relaxing of access to the reverse repurchase facility for participating institutions from mid October 2008 eased liquidity constraints in the money market.

    "text": "The Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) commenced publishing core in\ufb02 ation in 2008 as it was considered an important element in gauging underlying in\ufb02 ation, which is in\ufb02 ation driven by demand pressures in the economy. The purpose of measuring core inflation is to identify the underlying long-term trend in in\ufb02 ation, which the Central Bank could address through its monetary policy measures. Among various methods of compiling core in\ufb02 ation, the exclusion of food and energy prices from overall in\ufb02 ation is used in a number of countries, and the DCS introduced this measure in 2008. The present core in\ufb02 ation index is based on the CCPI (2002=100), and is calculated by removing the food and energy components entirely from the overall price index. In\ufb02 ation arising from these components, that is, food and energy, is usually transitory and central banks do not respond to transitory changes in in\ufb02 ation as, if responded to, it could lead to even higher volatility in in\ufb02 ation and output growth. However, the Central Bank perceives that deriving a core in\ufb02 ation index based on the exclusion of the entire food and energy components, which together comprise almost 49 per cent of the consumer basket, may be subject to some shortcomings. In particular, the gap between core and headline in\ufb02 ation has been too wide due to the removal of a large component of the consumption basket and the sharp rise in food and energy prices in 2008. While such a core in\ufb02 ation measure may be a useful indicator of demand driven in\ufb02 ation, the large disparity between the two indicators would make it dif\ufb01 cult to build public con\ufb01 dence in the core in\ufb02 ation measure and therefore, diminishes its usefulness in managing in\ufb02 ation expectations. Hence, the Central Bank is exploring alternative methods of calculating core in\ufb02 ation measures with a view to introducing an improved index of core in\ufb02 ation.",

The Central Bank took several measures in 2008 and early 2009 to ensure stability in domestic \ufb01 nancial institutions and markets and thereby the \ufb01 nancial system as a whole. One such measure was to inject liquidity to address liquidity dif\ufb01 culties in some \ufb01 nancial institutions with a view to ensuring the smooth functioning of the \ufb01 nancial system and mitigating any systematic risk. However, such liquidity injections naturally increase liquidity in the market thereby increasing in\ufb02 ationary pressures unless excess liquidity is absorbed by the Central Bank on a permanent basis. Meanwhile, increases in excess liquidity in the market pose dif\ufb01 culties in monetary management as it would require immediate absorption, thus impacting on market interest rates. Hence, it is important that stability in the \ufb01 nancial system, that is, in institutions and markets, is preserved through enhanced supervision and prudential measures, which would help effective monetary management. This would also strengthen monetary policy transmission, thereby supporting the conduct of monetary policy.",

Exchange rate management particularly in turbulent periods stemming from external shocks poses dif\ufb01 culties to the Central Bank\u2019s monetary operations, particularly to maintaining stability in all markets. Pressures emanating from external shocks require the Central Bank to intervene in the foreign exchange market in order to mute violent \ufb02 uctuations in the exchange rate and thereby reduce the adverse impact on other macroeconomic variables. Although such interventions by the Central Bank bring stability to the foreign exchange market, it may pose a threat to the smooth operation of the domestic money market. For instance, if foreign exchange is provided to the market, the resultant decline in rupee liquidity could create upward pressure on interest rates, which may not be consistent with the desired monetary policy stance. In such circumstances, the Central Bank may be required to inject liquidity to the domestic market to replace the liquidity absorbed through interventions and maintain monetary expansion on the desired path. However, if the liquidity shortfall is large in magnitude, it may pose dif\ufb01 culties to the Bank to attain the monetary policy objective set out as banks are faced with a liquidity constraint and may not wish to expand their operations though such an expansion is warranted by the monetary policy stance.",

    "text": "The conduct of monetary policy in 2009 would be even more challenging in view of several considerations. In\ufb02 ation is on a decelerating trend creating room for a considerable easing of monetary policy. There is increasing demand for monetary easing, particularly in view of the declining external demand due to global recessionary conditions, to support domestic economic activities. In fact, the monetary programme for 2009 also expects an easing. However, monetary policy easing needs to be carefully assessed in view of its possible impact on the external sector, which is under pressure as a consequence of the global \ufb01 nancial crisis. At the same time, there is a risk of the government resorting to borrow substantially from the banking system, until anticipated \ufb01 nancial \ufb02 ows are forthcoming, which may lead to monetary expansion even without easing monetary policy through an interest rate reduction. While there is a lack of demand for credit, there is also reluctance on the part of banks to extend credit, in view of their need to safeguard liquidity and avoid loan losses in the present stressful environment.",
