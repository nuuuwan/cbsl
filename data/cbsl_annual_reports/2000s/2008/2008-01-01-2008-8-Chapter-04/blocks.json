    "text": "he general price level, as measured by the Colombo Consumers\u2019 Price Index (CCPI 2002=100), continued to increase rapidly in the \ufb01 rst half of the year reaching a high of 28.2 per cent on an year-on-year basis in June 2008, before decelerating gradually to 14.4 per cent at the end of the year. The annual average in\ufb02 ation rate rose to 22.6 per cent in 2008, compared with 15.8 per cent recorded in 2007. The lagged effect of adverse monetary conditions that prevailed in the past as well as adverse developments in commodity prices contributed to the increase in the index values in the \ufb01 rst half of 2008. The increase in consumer price index during the \ufb01 rst half of the year was also fuelled by the low supply of domestically produced agricultural commodities and the very high prices of imports, particularly food items, crude oil and petroleum products, in the international market. The upward revisions of the fuel prices, in late May 2008, had a signi\ufb01 cant impact on the surge in the level of CCPI. However, these adverse developments were abated in the second half of the year due to several factors predominant both in the domestic and external fronts. The tight monetary policy pursued by the Central Bank effectively dampened in\ufb02 ationary pressures thereby causing the index to rise at a slower rate. The improvements in the domestic supply, especially the bumper paddy harvest in the Yala season, and the easing of commodity prices in the international market further aided the rapid deceleration in the rate of increase in the index in the second half of the year. Meanwhile, the core in\ufb02 ation, an in\ufb02 ation rate which presents the changes in prices in respect to the monetary policy is derived by excluding food and energy items from",

However, in response to the building up of in\ufb02 ationary pressures in the economy, the Central Bank commenced tightening monetary policy from 2006 onwards. This was instrumental in checking the demand pressure in the economy towards the second half of 2008. Adhering to tight reserve money targets, limiting reverse repo facilities to commercial banks and introducing a penal rate of interest on provision of reverse repo facilities to more frequent users of that facility, helped contain the growth of the money supply, thereby checking the building up of demand pressure in the economy. Accordingly, the point-to-point growth in the narrow money supply was contained at just 2.7 per cent in 2007 and 4.0 per cent in 2008 compared to the level of 12.6 per cent in 2006. The expansion of the broad money supply was also reduced on a point-to-point basis from 17.8 per cent in 2006 to 16.6 per cent and 8.5 per cent in 2007 and 2008, respectively.

Excessive rain in the island that damaged part of the Maha paddy harvest and vegetables, caused substantial price increases in these commodities. Further, the increased demand for rice that resulted from the substitution effect caused by the increased price of wheat \ufb02 our, the limited availability of stocks with the farmers and the competition of private millers for the purchase of paddy also contributed to the increase in rice prices. As a result, retail prices of rice rose in the range of 59-81 per cent (upper band being the price of samba rice) from August, 2007 up to April, 2008. However, the price ceiling imposed on rice by the government in mid-April, 2008, helped stabilize rice prices. The improvement in domestic supply due to the bumper harvest in Yala season thereafter contributed to stabilize the prices. The average retail price of rice dropped by 2.4 per cent during the period April to December, 2008. The prices of \ufb01 sh continued to increase notably during the \ufb01 rst eight months of the year reaching its peak in August, 2008, owing to the increase in cost of \ufb01 shing and transportation in spite of the increased production of \ufb01 sh.

The average price of crude oil imported in 2008 rose by 37 per cent from US dollars 71 per barrel in 2007 to US dollars 97 per barrel in 2008. Meanwhile, the import price of crude oil recorded historically high levels which peaked at US dollars 134 per barrel in July, 2008, though it came down to a low of US dollars 46 per barrel in December, 2008. Corresponding to these price increases, the domestic fuel prices were adjusted upward four times during January to July, 2008. Accordingly, the domestic prices of petrol, diesel and kerosene were raised by 48 per cent, 94 per cent and 57 per cent respectively, by May, 2008 compared to the prices that prevailed in May, 2007. As the prices of crude oil began to decline in the international market, the domestic prices of fuel were revised downward on \ufb01 ve occasions during the remaining period of the year resulting in a drop in the price of diesel and kerosene by 46 per cent and 38 per cent, respectively by end 2008. However, the net price of petrol was 3 per cent higher by December, 2008 compared to that of December, 2007. The import price of LP gas \ufb02 uctuated between US dollars 0.93-1.00 per kilogram in 2008. Correspondingly, the domestic prices of LP gas were increased on 4 occasions and decreased on 3 occasions during the year. The net price impact was an increase of average LP gas prices by 17.9 per cent, over the previous year. Further, the import price of fertilizer increased by 114 per cent during 2008 compared to 40 per cent increase in 2007. Price increases of imported goods were further in\ufb02 uenced by the increased freight charges in response to high fuel prices in the \ufb01 rst half of the year.

    "text": "second half of the year with the price decreases in the international market. The increases were predominantly driven by high food prices in the global market, which were caused by supply shortage of agricultural commodities in major producing countries owing to bad weather conditions and diversion of agricultural products, such as sugar, wheat grain and edible oil to production of bio-fuels with the prevalence of high petroleum prices. The rising prices of world food commodities such as wheat grain, milk powder, dhal etc. exerted signi\ufb01 cant pressure on the general price level until mid-2008. However, the measures taken by the government to bring down the escalating food prices, such as imposing price ceilings on rice and milk powder and reducing import duty on edible oils were effective in stabilizing the price levels to some extent. Meanwhile, as many of the major economies slid into a global recession, there was a contraction in the world demand for most commodities including crude oil. As a result, commodity prices declined in the international market during the latter part of the year. Accordingly, the international prices of milk powder, sugar, Mysore dhal etc. declined signi\ufb01 cantly. Since in\ufb02 ation in 2008 was triggered mainly by the global commodity price increases, the dwindling global prices during the latter part of the year also paved the way for in\ufb02 ation to reduce.",

    "text": "Administrative prices were revised several times in 2008. These price revisions directly and indirectly affected the prices of both domestically produced and imported goods. The changes of the prices of kerosene, diesel and petrol were made administratively. In line with these fuel price revisions, both the public and private sector bus fares were also revised during 2008. The net impact of such changes resulted in an average increase of 17.6 per cent in bus fares during the year. Meanwhile, the rail fares were increased by an average rate of 79 per cent in June, 2008 for the \ufb01 rst time in three years. However, following the reduction in diesel prices in December, rail fares were decreased by 74 per cent. The electricity charges for both domestic and industrial purposes were increased in 2008, raising the cost of production of goods and services, thereby escalating price levels. Although the administrative price revisions had a spillover effect through increased input costs, the reduction of subsidy components embedded in those prices was an essential demand management measure to contain in\ufb02 ation in the long run.",

The government also introduced a single Composite Levy in the \ufb01 rst half of 2008 instead of Customs duty and other applicable taxes at the point of importation on eleven essential food items, which are highly sensitive to public lives. The price of wheat \ufb02 our during this period increased rapidly than prices of rice as the country\u2019s total consumption of wheat \ufb02 our depends on imports. Although prices of rice also increased substantially, it was lower than the international price surge during this period due to the fact that Sri Lanka produces a substantial portion of its total rice requirement. Considering the rapid increase of prices in the local market, the government stipulated maximum retail prices for different grades of rice in April, 2008 in order to contain the speculative pressure on prices and also lifted the customs duty on rice imports by August 2008. In addition, the government continued to provide a stimulus in the form of the fertiliser support for the paddy farmers even in the midst of high international fertiliser prices. The cost of the fertilizer support scheme increased to Rs.26,000 million in 2008 from Rs.11,000 million in 2007. A policy stimulus was also introduced by the government through its Budget 2009 targeting the promotion of domestic agriculture. This included the introduction of new Cess rates on the importation of a number of food items including grains and fruits some of which can be grown domestically. In the meantime, the implementation of the \u2018Api Wawamu-Rata Nagamu\u2019 (Let us grow-Let us develop), the government national program to improve the domestic agriculture was reinforced with growth vigour in the wake of the food crisis. Further, the government also made attempts to stabilise the food prices by taking measures to reviving activities related to Co-operatives, Lak Sathosa Outlets etc. to distribute essential commodities to consumers. With all these measures in place, Sri Lanka is in a position to face the challenge of world food crisis without having a major disruption to the domestic food supply.",

In this regard, government could provide institutional support to enhance the production and productivity and impetus for innovations in agriculture sector. Moreover, the efforts to facilitate marketing and related infrastructure is equally important. In this context, government re-oriented its policy on food security in order to maintain 100,000 metric tons of rice buffer stock annually. The maintenance of a buffer stock would assure uninterrupted future food supply while reducing the dependency on imported rice. This policy will also enable to purchase paddy from farmers at competitive prices as an effective measure in the event of excess supply of paddy.",

The government could also supplement this momentum by popularising good agricultural practices and also availing credit facilities for producers in these areas in addition to its concerted effort aiming at improving infrastructure conducive for agriculture. In fact, the government\u2019s Ten Year Horizon Development Framework: 2006-2016 has already highlighted many of these areas to be followed for the development of the agriculture sector in the medium term. Sri Lanka, being an agrarian society at its large rural base and endowed with much natural resources is well in a position to enhance food production as its strategic response to high food prices. In fact, the most appropriate way to meet the challenges of food crisis in the future would be by achieving higher economic growth, thereby raising income level so that people can afford to meet the higher expenditure on foods.",

The fuel price increases led to increase in the Transport sub index signi\ufb01 cantly, in June, 2008. The increase in the Health sub index was mainly attributed to the price increases in the services by private hospitals, pharmaceuticals, specialist consultations and medical laboratory services.

The annual average increase of 31.5 per cent in the Petroleum sub index, which has the second highest weight, was a result of the upward revision in domestic fuel prices during the \ufb01 rst half of the year which declined substantially during the latter part of the year. The contribution to the overall increase from this sector was around 16 per cent, an increase of 2 percentage points compared to the previous year. Chemical products sub group recorded an annual average increase of 45.7 per cent while Transport and Metal products sub groups increased by 24.9 per cent and 25.6 per cent, respectively mainly due to the increase in prices of raw materials and pharmaceutical products and metal prices in the international market.

This increase resulted in a considerable gain in the nominal wage rate indices during the second part of the year. However, the real wages of the government employees, on average, suffered a loss in the range of 12.2-12.5 per cent during the year 2008. In terms of the Public Administration Circular No. 15/2008 dated July 21, 2008 issued with regard to the payment of COLA to public servants, the monthly COLA of Rs. 2,500/- (which had been paid up to June, 2008), was increased by Rs. 1,000/- with effect from July, 2008. It was applicable for the of\ufb01 cers who were serving in the posts with initial monthly salary below Rs. 22,935/-. As a result, the revised monthly COLA paid to employees in the eligible categories of Public Service, Provincial Public Service and Armed Forces with effect from July, 2008, rose to Rs. 3,500/-. Meanwhile, a monthly COLA of Rs. 2,875/- was paid to the of\ufb01 cers whose initial monthly salary was Rs. 22,935/- or above. It was further decided that an allowance at the rate of Rs. 116.66 per working day be paid for employees who are drawing daily paid emoluments.",

The average daily wages of sub-categories of paddy, coconut, tea and rubber increased by 21 per cent, 23 per cent, 17 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively in 2008. The increase in wages of these sub-sectors was partly due to the wage demands made by these workers for higher daily wages, in order to maintain their real wages at a certain level. Though the prices of certain exported items, especially, tea and rubber decelerated in the international market towards the latter part of the year, on average, the relative increase in prices of other commodities (e.g., coconut and paddy) in the domestic market enabled the producers to make higher payments to the workers. However, within the Agricultural sector, the rates of increase in daily wages in most of the sub-categories varied due to the diversity among the different activities.",

However, those in the sub-categories of rubber, coconut and paddy (male employees) enjoyed an increase in their real wages. Daily wages for carpentry and masonry in the Construction sector recorded an increase of around 16 per cent due to the wage demands made by these workers, the continued demand for workers for construction activities and also the shortages of such skilled workers due to migration for foreign employment. However, these employees experienced real wage losses in 2008, as in the last year.",

Trade union action in the plantation sector during the third quarter of the year which reported 22 strikes had an impact on the plantation industry due to the loss of 33,609 man-days involving 31,648 workers. The number of strikes in the rest of the private sector in 2008 remained unchanged at 17 strikes compared with 2007. However, the total man-days lost decreased by 28 per cent as the number of workers involved declined dramatically by more than 35 per cent in this category. This favourable development was a combined result of various factors such as better relationships among parties and maintaining better dialogue at the workplace to improve industrial harmony.
