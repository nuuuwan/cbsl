    "text": "he Sri Lankan economy demonstrated its resilience by recording a real growth of 6 per cent in 2008 in the midst of unprecedented and unfavourable developments globally and domestically. During the first part of the year, food and energy crises in the global economy was threatening the macroeconomic stability by way of sharply widening trade and current account deficits, raising inflation to the highest ever levels since 1980s and exerting pressures on fiscal balances due to tax exemptions arising from duty waivers granted in order to minimise the impact of high food and energy prices on domestic cost of living coupled with high defence expenditure and the cost of rehabilitation, resettlement and reconstruction of the Eastern Province. Towards the latter part of the year, the second wave of the global financial crisis, which originated from the sub-prime mortgage issue in the United States, turned into an unprecedented global financial turmoil from September 2008 onwards, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Inc., which was a highly reputed major financial institution in the United States. The global financial turmoil triggered a reversal of capital flows from emerging market economies for safety, resulting in an outflow of approximately US dollars 120 billion from the Asian region within a short period towards end 2008. Sri Lanka also had to cope up with its share of sudden withdrawals of foreign capital by supplying almost 50 per cent of its external official reserves, which had been prudently accumulated to the highest ever level of US dollars 3.56 billion by end July 2008. Consequently, the accumulated balance of payments",

The Bank\u2019s monetary policy strategy, which is mainly based on restricting monetary expansion through quantitative targeting, demonstrated its effectiveness by recording the sharpest ever deceleration of year-on-year inflation from 28.2 per cent in June 2008 to 7.6 per cent by end February 2009. Tumbling global food and energy prices and allowing such price reduction to pass through to domestic prices, together with favourable supply side shocks by way of higher domestic agriculture production, also reinforced the monetary policy efforts in achieving price stability. Despite the tight monetary policy restraining the expansion in domestic demand and the looming global recession decelerating external demand, agricultural production recorded a favourable development, supported mainly by the renewed economic activity in the Eastern Province and attractive prices, particularly during the first half of the year. The continuation of the implementation of major infrastructure development projects also supported the economy to maintain around 6 per cent economic growth for the fourth consecutive year. Benefits of the continuation of high economic growth were reflected both in the lowest ever levels of unemployment and poverty levels recorded recently.",

Two unprecedented external shocks, namely global food and energy crises in the first half of 2008 and the intensification of the global financial crisis towards the latter part of the year, seriously affected the economy. Further, the government had to bear the cost of continuing the decisive phase of the war against terrorism in order to bring permanent peace to the country. The need for expediting the humanitarian and development work in the newly liberated areas, high domestic interest rates, high international prices of petroleum, fertiliser and essential commodities during the first half of 2008 exerted pressures to overrun recurrent expenditure. The exemptions of taxes and duties on fuel and essential food items, and the slowdown in imports and economic activities towards the latter part of the year, also created a significant revenue shortfall. In relation to financing the higher than expected budget deficit, the virtual drying up of external commercial financing and the sudden withdrawal of foreign investments in government securities forced the government to rely more on domestic bank financing. These challenges affected the fiscal outcome to deviate from the underlying assumptions of Budget 2008.",

It will also be an important occasion to introduce changes to their business models and management practices while taking measures to improve productivity.

The Services sector continued to provide the highest contribution of 57 per cent to overall growth while the Industry and Agriculture sectors contributed to 28 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively. The key performing sectors in the Services sector were Transport and Communication, and Banking, Insurance and Real Estate sub-sectors. The Wholesale and Retail Trade sub-sector, with a share of 24 per cent of GDP, slowed down owing to the external sector developments. In the Industry sector, the low performance of the manufacturing sector due to unfavourable external developments stemming from the global slowdown was the main contributory factor for the deceleration witnessed in the industry sector. The Agriculture sector performed well with an impressive growth with tea production recording its best ever performance in any first half in its history and the paddy sector also recording a bumper harvest in the Yala season. The performance of the fisheries sector was also strong given the continuation of growth on a high base from the previous year. The first nine month\u2019s economic growth at 6.5 per cent was instrumental in the decline of the unemployment rate to a record low of 5.2 per cent in 2008 compared to 6.5 per cent and 6.0 per cent in 2006 and 2007, respectively.",

The slowdown in the export trade sub-sector stemmed from the global economic slowdown, which contributed heavily to the slowdown in the growth momentum in the services sector. The growth in the telecommunication sector was largely supported by the expansion in the coverage as reflected by the increased telephone density.",

The widened trade deficit was partly offset by the increased private remittances, which grew by well above 20 per cent throughout the first nine months, helping contain the current account deficit. Net foreign short-term inflows to the government and the private sector peaked at US dollars 1,004 million by end September 2008 and helped generate a surplus in the capital and financial account. This was more than sufficient to finance the higher current account deficit, generating a surplus by end September 2008.",

The unexpected decline in prices had a favourable impact on import expenditure in the last quarter. Petroleum imports, which grew by 61.4 per cent during the first three quarters, declined by 25.6 per cent in the fourth quarter. Reduction in expenditure on other imports, along with petroleum, led imports to decelerate very rapidly, to record a flat growth in the last quarter. As a result, imports grew by 24.0 per cent in 2008. All major categories of imports increased reflecting a broad based expansion. The higher growth of expenditure on imports in 2008 relative to the lower growth in exports contributed to the substantial expansion in the trade deficit in 2008. The overall trade deficit widened by 60.6 per cent to US dollars 5.9 billion in 2008 from US dollars 3.7 billion in 2007. As a percentage of GDP, the trade deficit deteriorated to 14.4 per cent in 2008 from 11.3 per cent in 2007.",

Foreign inflows to the government consisting of both loans and grants decreased in 2008, mainly due to the lack of counterpart funds for externally funded projects due to the global financial crisis. Though some commercial loans did not materialise as a result of the intensifying global financial crisis towards the end of the year, the government was able to mobilise US dollars 1.4 billion worth of loans and grants during 2008 as compared to US dollars 1.6 billion in 2007, which included the sovereign bond proceeds of US dollars 500 million. A larger portion of the loan inflows was on concessional terms and mostly directed towards the implementation of infrastructure projects such as expansion of the Colombo Port, construction of the Southern Expressway, the new Hambantota Port, etc.",

As a result, outstanding Treasury bills and bonds investments by foreigners reached its peak level of US dollars 641 million by September 2008. However, these investments collapsed with the deepening of the global financial crisis and the inflows recorded till the end of September 2008, suddenly reversed and by end 2008, turned into a net outflow of US dollars 213 million. This was due to the withdrawal of US dollars 430 million in the last quarter as investors shifted funds rapidly on concerns of safety and liquidity amidst the global credit crunch. In order to meet the sudden foreign exchange requirement arising from the liquidation of these investments and to create confidence among the investors, the Central Bank created a Sinking Fund, which facilitated the withdrawal of funds by foreign investors without exerting any undue pressure on the domestic foreign exchange market.",

The meeting of fiscal targets in Budget 2008 was a challenging task due to several reasons: First, the need for enhanced allocations for intensified war against terrorism, and for expediting the humanitarian and development work in the newly liberated areas. Second, the relatively high inflation that prevailed until mid-2008 and the relatively high interest rates that prevailed in the domestic market throughout the year. Third, the high international prices of petroleum, fertiliser and essential commodities that prevailed until end July 2008. Fourth, the global financial crisis, which intensified since mid-September 2008 and resulted in a slowdown of domestic economic activities, outflow of foreign investments in government securities and virtual drying up of expected foreign commercial borrowings for budgetary operations. These challenges affected the targeted fiscal outcome, as they led to the deviations in the underlying assumptions of Budget 2008.",

As a result, total annual revenue, in nominal terms, increased only by 16 per cent. This was mainly attributed to a sharp drop in international trade related taxes, especially due to the lower quantity and value of vehicle imports, and the slowdown in domestic economic activities, which resulted in a drop in the revenue from both direct and indirect taxes. The recurrent expenditure, in nominal terms, exceeded the budgetary target but as a per cent of GDP, continued to decline. The overrun in the recurrent expenditure was mainly due to the higher than expected expenditure on salaries and wages, pension payments, fertiliser subsidy, counter terrorism activities, and intensified humanitarian and development work in the newly liberated areas. Nevertheless, the public investment was maintained at 6.0 per cent of GDP compared to 6.4 per cent recorded in the previous year, which is a commendable achievement under difficult",

This performance was achieved through the continuation of the mega infrastructure development projects and implementation of a number of provincial and rural infrastructure development activities aiming at empowering the rural masses.

The government opted to rely more on domestic borrowings to finance the budget deficit in the midst of the tight liquidity situation in the international financial markets. Accordingly, net domestic financing increased significantly to 7.1 per cent of GDP and the net financing from foreign sources was considerably below the targets and accounted for 0.6 per cent of GDP. The recourse to bank financing was increased mainly due to the limited availability of resources in the domestic non-bank sector and the relatively high interest rates that prevailed in the government securities market. Of the total borrowings from the banking system in 2008, about three fourth was made during the fourth quarter of the year. Meanwhile, the government\u2019s outstanding debt to GDP ratio continued to decline mainly reflecting the higher growth of nominal GDP than the growth in nominal debt.",

The significant deceleration in inflation confirms that the Central Bank\u2019s strategy of focusing more on quantitative targets to contain market liquidity and allowing the market interest rates to adjust at a faster pace has been more effective in a high inflationary environment. Inflation further decelerated during the first quarter of 2009, at a faster rate than expected, and reached single digit levels by end February. Since inflation is stabilising at a more manageable level, the Central Bank intends to revert to conducting the monetary policy operations within the interest rate corridor formed by its policy rates in 2009 and maintain interest rates stable around a level consistent with the reserve money targets.",

The trajectory of the deceleration in global measures of trade, industrial production, financial flows, etc. has been shockingly rapid. The forecasts for the global economic growth in the immediate future are getting progressively gloomy.

With the increased outflow of foreign exchange and coupled with declined inflows due to a lower demand for exports, there was a pressure on the exchange rate to depreciate amidst virtual drying up of credit lines. To ensure adequate US dollar liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market, the Central Bank, while allowing limited flexibility in the exchange rate, supplied US dollars to the market, to ensure stability in the domestic foreign exchange market. With the supply of US dollars to the domestic market, the rupee liquidity however suffered continuous shortfalls, resulting in rupee borrowing costs remaining at higher levels. To overcome the liquidity shortfalls, the Central Bank released the liquidity absorbed through foreign exchange operations by reducing the Statutory Reserve Ratio in three steps by 3 per centage points",

The exports, which increased by 9.6 per cent during the first three quarters of 2008, declined by 2.7 per cent in the last quarter of 2008. Due to the highly competitive nature of the export market and relatively high cost of production in Sri Lanka, many exporters operate with comparatively low profit margins. Accordingly, many exporters have found it difficult to sustain growth of apparel exports in the face of reducing demand. The tea industry was also adversely affected due to the reduction of the tea prices in the international markets. With the international prices of other agricultural export crops like rubber and cinnamon also declining, making continued production unviable, the government had to intervene to stabilize the prices. In addition, other export oriented industries such as rubber based products, diamond and jewellery etc., were also affected by the crisis and the government had to unveil an economic stimulus package that aimed at revitalizing these key sectors. In the meantime, some local industries resorted to short-term lay-offs of workers in the hope of staying afloat with the depressed demand.",

Most countries in the G-20 which represents about 90 per cent of global gross national product and 80 per cent of world trade are considered to be in recession. A slowdown in advanced economies will have substantial effects on foreign direct investment inflows, export demand, commodity prices, debt roll-over, short-term foreign financing and finally, on exchange rate movement and reserves. The fairly high trade openness which is measured by the share of trade in income indicates the increased exposure of the country to external vulnerabilities. Although the share of agriculture in the total exports is lower at about 15 per cent, high prices fetched by agricultural commodities led by tea provided the basis of export earnings in 2008.

A decline in imports will have a favourable impact on the trade balance, balance of payments and finally on reserves.

These will be further strengthened by the pending Stand-by Arrangement with the IMF which will build up confidence internationally on the debt repayment capacity of the country and encourage further capital inflows while ensuring fiscal consolidation as envisaged by the government.",

The Central Bank has mainly relied on aggressive open market operations to maintain market liquidity at a level consistent with the reserve money targets. Therefore, to streamline open market operations, restrictions were imposed on market participants\u2019 access to the Central Bank\u2019s standing facility at the reverse repurchase rate, to only 3 times per calendar month, and were limited in aggregate only to an amount equivalent to the liquidity shortfall as estimated by the Central Bank. The access beyond these limits was allowed at a penal rate of 19 per cent. To enforce its tight monetary policy stance, the Central Bank also refrained from subscribing to Treasury bills at primary market auctions and special issues, except for replacing liquidity absorbed through operations in the foreign exchange market. In line with the policy measures aimed at managing liquidity to maintain quantity targets, market interest rates continued to remain at relatively high levels.",

The outflows of foreign investment in government Treasury bills and bonds in the heightened global liquidity shortage and the drying up of foreign credit lines making it difficult to raise foreign commercial borrowings, created a severe shortage of liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market requiring the Central Bank to supply foreign exchange to meet the excess demand including that for settlement of large oil bills and foreign loans. This created a large rupee liquidity deficit in the market, which had to be addressed through monetary policy measures. Accordingly, the Central Bank reduced the SRR on all rupee deposit liabilities of commercial banks on two occasions in October and November 2008 by a total of 2.25 percentage points to 7.75 per cent and thereby released Rs. 24.5 billion to the",

However, the reserve money expansion decelerated at a faster rate during the latter part of the year as the impact of demand management policies were re-imposed by the liquidity constraint resulting from the global financial crisis. As a result, the annual average reserve money growth moderated to around 8.5 per cent as compared to the annual target of 9.7 per cent. In tandem with the trend in reserve money, the rate of expansion in the broad money also declined significantly to 8.5 per cent by end 2008 as compared to an expected growth of 11 per cent. The expansion in the broad money supply was entirely due to the increase in net domestic assets (NDA) as net foreign assets (NFA) of both the Central Bank and the commercial banks had declined considerably by end 2008. The NDA of the banking system picked up significantly during the latter part of the year primarily due to higher growth in net credit to the government (NCG) despite the deceleration in credit to the private sector. NCG, which remained below the end 2007 levels during the first quarter, escalated thereafter particularly as a result of the difficulties in raising envisaged foreign financing by the government due to the global financial crisis. The expansion in NCG was noted in credit by both the Central Bank and the commercial banks. The contribution by the Central",

The domestic financial system also came under stress due to liquidity problems faced by one commercial bank and the failure of some unauthorised finance businesses during 2008. However, the Central Bank came to the rescue of the troubled commercial bank in a timely manner and also implemented measures to prevent any systemic risks stemming from the undesirable external or domestic developments taking effect.

The downturn in the advanced economies has adversely affected the growth in the emerging and developing countries although this group of countries had in place sound policy frameworks and stronger public sector balance sheets. With the downturn in United States and Europe, countries with strong trade links with those countries experienced a slowdown, while some countries that relied on bank-related or portfolio inflows to finance large current account deficits were hard hit by an abrupt tightening of external financing.

    "text": "It is widely believed that the global economy is expected to shrink in 2009. IMF has projected that the global growth in 2009 will be between 0.5-1.0 per cent, the lowest since the World War II, before recovering during the course of 2010. Despite a series of both monetary and fiscal policy measures implemented by several advanced economies, the financial crisis continues to pull down the real economy as such policies failed to dispel uncertainty in the markets. Falling asset values across advanced and emerging economies and declining household wealth have exerted downward pressure on consumer demand and thereby sharply declining the international trade. Moreover, uncertainty among households and investors has prompted them to postpone expenditure thereby reducing the demand for consumer, intermediate and investment goods. Against this uncertain backdrop, the growth in advanced economies is now expected to contract by 2.0 per cent in 2009 as compared to a moderate growth of 1.0 per cent in 2008. The United States and Euro region, the major export destinations for Sri Lanka\u2019s industrial exports, are projected to contract by 1.6 per cent and 2.0 per cent, respectively, in 2009, compared to an estimated growth of 1.1 per cent and 1.0 per cent, respectively, in 2008. Meanwhile, the growth in emerging and developing economies is expected to continue, albeit at a slower rate of 3.3 per cent in 2009 from 6.3 per cent in 2008, mainly due to the expected decline in exports to advanced economies from these countries. The exports of emerging and developing countries are projected to contract by about 0.8 per cent in 2009 as compared to the growth of 5.6 per cent in 2008. With the continuous efforts to ease credit tightness, and expansionary fiscal and monetary policies pursued by several developed, and emerging and developing countries to stimulate domestic economies, the global economy is projected to recover gradually in 2010 with growth picking up to about 3.0 per cent. However, the growth projections for 2009 and beyond are uncertain and the economic recovery depends critically on the effectiveness of policy measures implemented by various governments in bringing in confidence among households and investors.",

    "text": "Global inflationary pressures eased towards the latter part of 2008 with a sharp deceleration in international commodity prices since July due to the slump in global demand. The global inflation was initially projected to accelerate faster in 2008 with rising international prices of crude oil and essential food items and expansionary fiscal and monetary policies implemented to overcome economic slowdown and liquidity shortages resulting from the sub-prime crisis. However, with the intensification of the global financial crisis since mid September 2008 and the resultant economic downturn in the advanced economies, the commodity prices dropped drastically easing inflationary pressures significantly. World inflation reached the highest rates since the late 1990s pushed up by a surge in fuel and food prices. In advanced economies, inflation reached around 4.3 per cent in August 2008 down from a peak in July with the easing of some commodity prices. Inflation was in double digits in several emerging and developing countries and it reached an average of around 8.3 per cent in August 2008 mainly due to considerably higher weight of food items in the consumption basket of these countries, typically in the range of 30-45 per cent as opposed to 10-15 per cent in the advanced economies. With the sluggish demand and slump in economic activity in the advanced economies, inflation is expected to decline from 3.5 per cent in 2008 to a low of 0.3 per cent in 2009. Some advanced economies may experience very low inflation, while some may even experience deflation if real economic activity contract drastically. In emerging and developing economies,",

The rate cuts initiated by central banks in advanced countries with the turbulence in the international financial markets since July 2007 continued aggressively in 2008 and prompted central banks in several emerging and developing countries also to cut policy rates to avoid a slide in economic activity. Accordingly, the United States lowered its benchmark federal funds rate from 4.25 per cent by end 2007 to 0.00-0.25 per cent by end 2008. The European Central Bank reduced its benchmark rates from 4.25 per cent in July to 2.50 per cent in December 2008. Japan reduced its benchmark rates for the first time in 7 years by 20 basis points in October and by a further 20 basis points in December 2008. Meanwhile, UK reduced its policy rates by 1.5 percentage points in November, the largest single move in its history. Australia reduced its cash rate to 4.25 per cent in December 2008. Against the backdrop of sustained stress in the money markets, five of the leading central banks, namely, the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England, Bank of Canada and the Central Bank of Switzerland, in a coordinated move announced a series of measures to inject liquidity which was aimed at encouraging lending. The central banks in emerging markets too closely followed the coordinated rate cuts of the advanced countries to manage the global financial crisis and to calm the domestic financial markets. The Bank of Korea lowered its base rate for the first time in nearly 4 years to 4.25 per cent while Taiwan lowered its benchmark rate to 3.25 per cent in October 2008.",

    "text": "September 2008 following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Inc., a highly reputed major financial institution in the United States, causing significant losses to creditors and counterparties. Consequently, market pressures increased substantially eroding confidence in counterparties and seizing up the inter-bank market, despite coordinated injections of massive amounts of liquidity by major central banks and agreements on foreign exchange Swaps of an unprecedented magnitude. Subsequently, the unfolding instability necessitated the closure, nationalisation or merger of a number of other banks in United States and Europe. However, the increasing size and breadth of write-downs borne by financial institutions along with continued high funding pressures have hampered the ability of policy makers to address the crisis effectively. The financial system has been severely weakened by mounting losses, falling asset prices, and deepening economic downturn. The intensifying worries about counterparty risks have seriously affected the smooth operations of the global money markets as banks became very cautious in lending even among themselves as it is hard to assess the counterparty risks under the current global market conditions. In these circumstances, it is necessary to rebuild counterparty confidence and the financial soundness of institutions to ease liquidity tensions, allowing inter-bank markets to function normally again and intermediation to continue. In this regard, provision of sufficient liquidity and term-funding support from central banks, re-capitalisation of banks and effective measures to deal with troubled assets are vital to resolve the ongoing financial crisis and to restore confidence in the global financial system.",

This reflected the concerns about the growth outlook for the rest of the economies relative to the US economy as tensions in the global credit and funding markets intensified to extreme levels. The US dollar, which depreciated against the euro by 8.2 per cent to its weakest level since the inception of euro, appreciated in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 by 9.0 per cent and 1.9 per cent, respectively. Meanwhile, the Japanese Yen, which weakened against the US dollar in the first quarter, strengthened against the dollar in the third and fourth quarters by 3.5 per cent and 15.3 per cent, respectively. The Indian rupee depreciated against the US dollar at a higher rate due to substantial outflows of portfolio investment with the intensification of the global financial crisis and expected slowdown in the Indian economy.

Several advanced and emerging economies have launched extraordinary measures to deal with the global credit crunch, while adopting expansionary fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate domestic economic growth. These measures are expected to help recovery of the global economy and thereby boost demand for Sri Lanka\u2019s exports in the medium-term. Meanwhile, stimulus packages announced by the government in respect of industries and exporters in December 2008 and banking and other financial institutions in February 2009, respectively along with the easing of monetary policy by the Central Bank are expected to boost domestic demand and avoid any drastic decline in economic activity. The implementation of the planned infrastructure projects with bilateral and multilateral external funding is expected to continue providing some stimulus to economic growth though there could be some delays in the implementation of some projects, which require considerable amount of domestic funding or external commercial funding. In addition, economic activity in certain areas in the North and East of Sri Lanka, which were liberated by the armed forces recently, is likely to surge in the medium-term with the implementation of several rehabilitation and resettlement projects under the \u201cNeganahira Navodaya\u201d (Reawakening of the East) and \u2018Vadakkin Wasantham\u2019 (Flourishing North) programmes in the immediate future. The expected external and domestic financing for these projects and easing of monetary policy stance are likely to raise total investment as a percentage of GDP to 32 per cent in the medium-term.

As a result, implementation of some of the projects that require additional foreign financing and substantial domestic financing might have to be postponed or implemented at a slower pace, especially in 2009. However, in the medium-term with the expected recovery of the global economy, the government would be able to mobilise required external commercial financing to supplement the disbursement of committed funds by Sri Lanka\u2019s development partners. By end 2008, the government had a cumulative financial commitment of around US dollars 5.9 billion from Sri Lanka\u2019s development partners in the pipeline as compared to US dollars 4.7 billion at end 2007 and this amount is likely to increase further in the medium-term with the expected external funding for resettlement and rehabilitation of the liberated Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka.",

This has been fuelled largely by the excessive monetary expansion arising from the increased financing of widening fiscal deficits with bank resources. In order to contain the inflation and inflation expectations, the Central Bank adopted a quantity based stringent monetary policy strategy in 2007 and 2008 that has yielded desired results supported by declining international commodity prices.

The NP is enriched with a range of natural resources such as fertile agricultural lands, mineral ores, forests, scrublands, wet lands, beautiful beaches, the coastal shallow sea from Trincomalee to Mullaitivu enriched with a very high fish density in seas around the country and coral deposits. However, for more than 25 years, the NP had been adversely affected by the internal conflict situation. As such, the government intervention in economic activities in this area was severely restricted. The prolonged conflict in the NP has brought a significant devastation to the region. It is manifested by the displacement of a large number of families, damages to basic infrastructure facilities, badly affected educational and training facilities, weak banking facilities, destruction of productive assets and properties and a significant disruption to the major economic activities in agriculture, livestock, fisheries, small industry as well as health and education services.",

As there will be more employment opportunities in the near future, both locally and overseas with the expected global recovery, it would be prudent to use the current situation to train and retrain the unemployed in areas where there will be more employment opportunities.

Any further deceleration in economic activities during the course of the year would adversely affect the expected revenue collection in 2009. The potential spillover effects of the global financial crisis may necessitate the government to adopt decisive and properly conceived responses through additional fiscal measures to mitigate such negative effects. In such a scenario, given the limited fiscal space, it is vital to ensure that measures so introduced are well targeted, temporary and contribute to stimulate economic activities without having a significant fiscal slippage. In the meantime, the provision of sufficient funds to develop the Northern and Eastern provinces has to be continued considering its utmost importance. Therefore, taking complementary measures to minimise the revenue shortfall and the creation of room in the recurrent budget to offset the additional expenditure to the maximum possible extent, should be given the highest priority in the overall fiscal strategy towards minimising the adverse ramifications emanating from the global financial crisis at this important juncture. Once these issues are addressed effectively, the government will",

To ensure a sustainable higher economic growth and anchor the inflation expectation towards low inflation, it is crucial that the government fast track the fiscal consolidation measures on a priority basis. The medium-term fiscal consolidation efforts need to particularly focus on addressing the still prevailing drawbacks in the country\u2019s fiscal system. The shortfall in the revenue collection and expenditure overruns increase the government\u2019s borrowing requirement thereby augmenting the outstanding debt and future interest cost. It has been observed that more often, the government borrowing from the banking system has far exceeded its original targets by a substantial amount posing major challenges to the monetary authority in the conduct of monetary policy. In addition, the higher domestic borrowings, especially to meet recurrent expenditures, pre-empts the available resources for public investment thereby seriously affecting the future growth potential of the country, which is a huge opportunity cost compared to the benefits that could accrue to the country from capital investments in the future. The monetary policy measures implemented to contain the excessive monetary expansion in the economy inevitably lead to contraction of credit to the private sector as the government\u2019s borrowings are insensitive to market interest rates. This would adversely impact on the private sector, which generally contributes to the largest share of domestic production thereby retarding the future growth prospects of the country. The government\u2019s borrowings from the domestic banking system are likely to increase sharply in 2009 as well, since it will be very challenging to raise loans from external sources under the current global conditions. In this context, it will be prudent to postpone the implementation of any new mega projects till the recovery of global financial markets, while carrying out projects that are already in progress at a slower pace to keep the domestic financing requirement in check. Alternatively, government should explore the",

Though the domestic banks and other financial institutions were not directly affected by the global financial crisis, primarily due to the existing restrictions on foreign investment by these financial institutions, the collapse of a few illegal deposit taking institutions caused some panic in the domestic financial markets. Consequently, there was a tendency to withdraw deposits even from registered finance companies posing a threat to financial institutions. The Central Bank has been continuously engaged in educating the general public, which includes the publication of a list of registered finance companies in the mass media and warning the general public to be vigilant about illegal deposit mobilisation by various institutions and individuals under a different guise. However, it appears that some members of the public have ignored the high risks associated with depositing their money with the illegal institutions as they were searching for higher returns for their deposits. Considering this situation, the Central Bank is in the process of amending the Finance Companies Act with the view of strengthening the provisions prohibiting illegal financial businesses and deposit-taking. In addition, the definition of \u201cdeposits\u201d is also to be widened to cover a broader range of fund mobilisation activities while the acceptance of deposits without authorisation will also be made an offence.",

Given the centrality of the country\u2019s location and associated logistics, catering to demand from both, the developed economies and the emerging markets, may not be a difficult task, if properly planned. Apparel products continue to be the single largest industrial export, though the country\u2019s export structure has diversified to some extent since the liberalisation of the economy in 1977. In terms of markets, Sri Lanka\u2019s exports to the US have continued to decline, while exports to the EU have improved, especially under the increased market access offered under the GSP+ scheme. The EU has extended the GSP+ scheme for Sri Lanka for 3 years from 2009-2011, subject to an investigation. In this context, the government would need to coordinate activities with the apparel exporters to initiate diplomatic actions, jointly, to obtain duty free market access to the US and to continue to have the duty free access to the EU market. Meanwhile, the exporters should make concerted efforts to penetrate into other emerging markets and the government should formulate an effective industrialisation and export strategy to diversify the export structure and the markets. In this respect, it is necessary to formulate strategies jointly with the exporters to penetrate into the giant markets of India and Pakistan where duty free market access under the free trade agreements (FTAs) is available, but has not yet been fully harnessed.",

The continuous budgetary support for infrastructure development, despite fiscal constraints, is laudable, while more efforts to catalyse greater private financing through Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) are needed to supplement government investments and for a sustained development of infrastructure. In fact, PPP is a joint venture between the government and the private sector, where the private sector will contribute to the capital, engage in management and share profits or losses.

It should be noted that consistent policy, good governance and transparency, institutional capacity building, effective regulations and efficient financial markets are prerequisites in promoting private investments in both economic and social infrastructure projects. A proper mechanism to promote PPPs will eventually reduce government commercial borrowings in the backdrop of gradually declining concessional loans from Sri Lanka\u2019s development partners as a result of the increasing per capita income of the country and substantially reduce the future fiscal burden of the government. This would enable the government to use the available limited resources to provide public goods in which, the private sector is reluctant to provide, thereby raising the overall economic efficiency.",

The CEB is one of the public utilities that has been making persistent operational losses due to numerous structural weaknesses. In this context, the Sri Lanka Electricity Act (SLEA) provides the basic legal framework for separation of specific operational activities an allows the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) to regulate the electricity sector. Nevertheless, the Act still imposes certain constraints on private sector participation in key areas of operation, such as generation and distribution, whereby either complete or partial involvement of the government in the generation and distribution is compulsory.

As a result, the CPC has borrowed heavily from commercial banks to settle import bills thereby incurring high financial costs leading to operational losses.

The Cairn India Ltd., was selected as the successful tenderer and has been offered the licence for exploring oil in the Block 2. Cairns Lanka Ltd., the local subsidiary of cairn India Ltd. is to commence exploration activities during the first quarter of 2009. The continuation of this process as planned is important despite the sharp dip in international oil prices, as the oil prices are bound to surge sharply once the global economy recovers in the period ahead.",
