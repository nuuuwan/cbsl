The \ufb01 nancial services industry grew at a more moderate pace during the year, in response to the tighter monetary policy stance adopted to reduce in\ufb02 ationary pressures, and continued to support economic activity. Overall, \ufb01 nancial institutions maintained their soundness with sustained pro\ufb01 tability, increased capitalisation and improvements in risk management, supported by enhanced regulation and supervision. The \ufb01 nancial indicators of the banking sector for 2008 show that pro\ufb01 tability has been maintained, while lending has moderated in response to the tighter monetary policy stance. The capital adequacy ratios of the banking sector remained well above the minimum regulatory standards. The liquidity position of the banking sector was comfortable, while the non-performing loan ratio has risen slightly. The Central Bank took decisive action to arrange the rescue of a commercial bank that experienced liquidity problems due to the failure of a credit card company associated with the Ceylinco Group. Although the earnings of the \ufb01 nance and leasing company sector have been constrained due to higher funding costs, its resilience has been strengthened by improved capital positions. Since the last two months of 2008, some regulated \ufb01 nance companies have been experiencing high deposit withdrawals and liquidity pressures consequent to the failure of certain unauthorised \ufb01 nance businesses.

The turmoil in global \ufb01 nancial markets worsened in 2008 with the crisis spreading beyond the US subprime mortgage market to the prime real estate, consumer credit and other corporate credit markets in the US and Europe. The crisis was a fallout of an exceptional credit growth and leverage in the \ufb01 nancial system of advanced economies during a long period of low interest rates, high liquidity and low volatility, which led to lax credit standards, de\ufb01 ciencies in risk management and inadequate regulation and supervision. Mounting losses on complex structured securities eroded the capital buffers of \ufb01 nancial institutions causing the failure or near failure of several large \ufb01 nancial institutions in the advanced economies. This triggered a sharp rise in counter-party credit risk aversion and a seizure in money markets in the US and Europe. In September and early October, con\ufb01 dence sank to critical levels, bringing these financial systems close to a systemic collapse. The \ufb01 nancial crisis also caused a downswing in economic prospects, while equity markets across the world plunged. Governments and central banks in advanced economies responded by introducing a number of extraordinary measures aimed at stabilising and restoring confidence to financial markets, restructuring affected \ufb01 nancial institutions and reducing the impact of the \ufb01 nancial crisis on the real economy. The measures included the injection of liquidity to money and other credit markets, reduction in policy interest rates, guarantees on deposits and bank debt, recapitalisation, purchase of troubled assets and shares and the nationalisation of banks.",

The partial closure of the capital account and the regulatory regime has safeguarded \ufb01 nancial institutions to a great extent from the direct impact of the global \ufb01 nancial turmoil. Nevertheless, the negative impact of the slump in global trade on the export sector and the domestic economy has led to an increase in the non\u2013performing loans. The Central Bank introduced several prudential measures in the last few years to strengthen the risk management and resilience of banks. These include the enhancement of minimum capital levels, general provisioning requirements, mandatory corporate governance requirements, revised loan classi\ufb01 cation and speci\ufb01 c provisioning requirements, revised single borrower limits, and guidelines for integrated risk management. In addition, banks migrated to the Basle II Capital Adequacy Framework which covers credit, market and operational risk under the simpler approaches from January 2008. The regulatory and prudential framework governing other financial institutions has also been strengthened, with enhancements to capital requirements in some categories.",

As a consequence, Seylan Bank encountered liquidity problems due to deposit withdrawals and curtailment of credit lines from other banks. As the dif\ufb01 culties at Seylan Bank posed a potential danger to the stability of the \ufb01 nancial system, the Central Bank in December 2008 took immediate action to preserve systemic stability. The measures included appointing persons to carry out the functions of the board of directors of Seylan Bank, the appointment of the state owned Bank of Ceylon to be the managing agent in order to facilitate business of Seylan Bank and the provision of liquidity support in the form of collateralised borrowings, mainly from the Central Bank.

The \ufb01 nance and leasing companies within the Ceylinco Group are the most affected. The main features of the scheme are that the Government through the state\u2013owned Lankaputhra Bank will provide Treasury bonds to finance and leasing companies against the sale of landholdings at a price of 67 per cent of the market value; the Government would give a guarantee to banks for credit facilities extended to \ufb01 nance and leasing companies up to the level provided at 30 September 2008 and the liquid asset ratio applicable to \ufb01 nance and leasing companies would be reduced by 5 percentage points. For institutions availing themselves of the facilities under the package, there would also be limitations on the salaries of top management and directors, and transfers to related parties would be prohibited, as the package is being \ufb01 nanced out of public funds.",

Credit for housing and construction (17 per cent), trading (15 per cent) and manufacturing, including apparel products (16 per cent) were the other sectors that account for the larger shares of bank lending. The asset quality of banks deteriorated marginally, indicating a slight increase in credit risk. Consequently, the non-performing loan ratio (NPL) of LCBs and LSBs increased in 2008. Hence, banks need to pay more attention to maintaining high credit standards to reverse this trend. LCBs were able to manage market risk adequately, while LSBs were slightly more exposed to interest rate risk. Both LCBs and LSBs had a low exposure to liquidity risk and were comfortably meeting the statutory liquid asset ratio requirement. The Central Bank recently issued guidelines on integrated risk management systems to banks, aimed at improving risk assessment and management to assist them in improving risk assessment and management through a holistic approach.",

There is also a Policy Holders Protection Fund which can be used in the event an insurer is unable to meet its obligations. The legal framework relating to prudential regulation and supervision will be upgraded with the proposed revisions of the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act. The powers of the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL) with respect to the stipulation of capital requirements, making rules and determinations, and enforcement will be strengthened. The \u201c\ufb01 t and proper\u201d test for directors of insurance companies and brokers and the registration of loss adjusters will be a requirement. The appointment of institutional agents will be introduced. The other important changes will be the requirement that life and non-life companies be separately incorporated within a period of three years and the listing of insurance companies on the stock exchange within a year. To improve the financial strength and soundness of insurance companies and to promote the consolidation of the industry, the IBSL proposes to increase the minimum equity capital of insurance companies from the current level of Rs. 200 million to Rs. 250 million for each type of insurance business in 2009.",

This was mainly facilitated by the higher net interest margins from core lending activities, growth in fee based income and improvements in operational ef\ufb01 ciencies due to the continued focus on cost management in banks, leading to greater productivity. Accordingly, pro\ufb01 t before tax was Rs. 45.7 billion, a growth of 21.7 per cent compared to a 24.0 per cent growth in 2007. Foreign banks contributed 61 per cent of the growth in pro\ufb01 ts of the sector, while domestic private banks contributed 18.8 per cent. Interest income remained the core source of income. The net interest margin of LCBs improved marginally to 4.7 per cent in 2008 from 4.5 per cent in 2007. Pro\ufb01 tability in terms of pre-tax ROA improved over the previous year and stood at 2.1 per cent. However, the ROE declined marginally despite the increase in pro\ufb01 ts, due to the greater increase in average equity.",

Hire purchase facilities, which accounted for 38 per cent of total accommodations, grew by 23 per cent while, \ufb01 nance leasing, which accounted for 31 per cent of total credit, recorded a decline of 1.5 per cent. The imposition of a ceiling on the claimable input Value Added Tax (VAT) on \ufb01 nance leases led to a decrease in the demand for lease facilities. Loans granted in relation to real estate have increased by 17 per cent to Rs. 10.8 billion during the year.

The ROA increased to 2.4 per cent while the ROE rose to 26.6 per cent. The risk weighted capital adequacy ratio decreased to 16.5 per cent from 35.2 per cent largely due to an increase in risk weighted assets.

All companies were compliant with the solvency margin requirement in respect of both long-term and general insurance in 2008. The increase in the industry solvency margin ratios for both long-term and general insurance during the year points to an improvement in the level of soundness of the industry. As a prudential requirement, insurance companies have to maintain a minimum of 30 per cent of their long-term fund and 20 per cent of their technical reserves for general insurance in government securities. Insurance companies held a large proportion of their assets in government securities of differing maturities (49 per cent of long-term and 29 per cent of general insurance reserves) in 2008 which has strengthened their earnings and helped to mitigate risks. From January 2008, insurance companies were required to cede 20 per cent of the general reinsurance premium to the National Insurance Trust Fund which will ensure that a higher proportion of the gross premia are retained in the country. The Policy Holders Protection Fund is \ufb01 nanced by a cess levied on insurance companies and can be utilised for the protection of policyholders in the event an insurer fails to meet its obligations.",

Out of this, a sum of Rs. 33 billion was raised through Treasury bond auctions, while the balance Rs. 456 billion was issued through direct placements to the market. The limit on foreign investment in Treasury bonds was increased in December 2007 and this contributed to the decline in the yield rates of Treasury bonds. The secondary market yield rates for 2 year Treasury bonds declined in the \ufb01 rst nine months of the year. However, the yield rate pertaining to 2 year Treasury bonds moved upwards to around 20 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2008, as foreigners sold off their Treasury bond holdings. The issue of long-term Treasury bonds was limited during the year, due to the high yield rates demanded for long-term maturities in the market during 2008. However, as in\ufb02 ation pressures subsided, small quantities of 3 and 4 year Treasury bonds were issued through private placements. The PDD continued the policy of re-opening the existing Treasury bond series, limiting the introduction of new bond series, as much as possible, to address high fragmentation of the bond market. However, the sharp increase in borrowings from domestic sources due to the sharp decline in funds available from external sources, affected the planned reduction of a number of bond series in 2008. Despite this issue, the PDD was able to maintain the total number of Treasury bond series at 42 at the end 2008, as in 2007.",

In addition, member \ufb01 rms are required to provide a minimum margin of 15 per cent on any purchase of a security over Rs. 20 million. The CSE monitors debtors\u2019 positions more closely and as a result the overall debtors\u2019 position has reduced considerably. A major change with respect to equity settlement that came into effect in 2008 was the introduction of a single tiered settlement cycle of T+3 for equity trades, which has mitigated the settlement risk to a great extent. Moving to a single-tiered settlement cycle will facilitate the introduction of a Delivery versus Payment system at the CSE in the future.",

Among districts, loan disbursement was greatest in Hambantota and Polonnaruwa, with each district accounting for around 15 per cent of total disbursements. Around 93 per cent of funds disbursed was for paddy cultivation in the Polonnaruwa District. In Hambantota, however, while paddy cultivation accounted for 52 per cent of disbursements, there was appreciable disbursement for vegetable and fruit cultivation and for small business activities as well. With the improvement of the security situation, the share of disbursements to the Eastern Province grew signi\ufb01 cantly. In rupee terms, total funds disbursed to that province more than doubled from Rs. 57 million in 2007 to Rs. 118 million in 2008. Although still very far from adequate, fund disbursement to the Northern Province also improved from Rs. 1.3 million in 2007 to Rs. 6.2 million in 2008.",

The Society for Worldwide Inter-bank Financial Telecommunication(SWIFT) provides the SWIFTNet system. It is a global \ufb01 nancial message transmission network, which uses advanced Information and Communication Technology for exchange of payment and securities information in a secure manner between transacting parties.
