1. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, OUTLOOK, ISSUES AND POLICIES

1.1 Overview

In the year 2000, the Sri Lanka economy expanded

strongly, in continuation of the revival of economic activity

that commenced in mid-1999, with a significant increase in

employment and a moderation of inflation. However, there

was a slow-down towards the end of the year, with the

fiscal and the balance of payments deficits widening

considerably, largely owing to the sharp escalation in world

petroleum prices, a shortfall in government revenue and the

sudden expansion in security expenditure. Further, unusually

low rainfall in the catchment areas resulted in a shortfall

in hydro power generation, thereby increasing dependence

on costly thermal generation. These developments exerted

pressure on foreign reserves, inducing a shift in the

exchange rate policy towards greater flexibility. In this

context, monetary policy had to be further tightened, with

a view to maintaining stability in domestic prices and

protecting external reserves. As a result, a rise in short-term

interest rates became unavoidable. Thus, macroeconomic

management became a vastly more challenging task in

2000.

The positive achievements in the year were the result

of the country harnessing benefits from an improved world

economic environment and the resilience which the

economy has built up, following the economic reforms for

over two decades. Yet evident, however, was a vulnerability

to which small economies are exposed by external shocks,

which underscored the need for adequate and timely

responses, and perseverance with strong economic reforms

and prudent economic management to build a more

diversified and responsive economy.

Despite the political imperatives of the national

elections until late 2000, the government took several

corrective measures, although some of them may have been

taken earlier with greater impact. They included measures

to enhance government revenue, rationalise public

expenditure, improve government cash management,

corrective increases in administered prices, tightening of

monetary policy and moving towards a more flexible

exchange rate regime. Now that the electoral process has

been concluded, an excellent opportunity has arisen to move

ahead strongly on further economic reforms to achieve

sustainable economic growth in the medium term. The

progress, of course, would depend heavily on the restoration

of peace. There is tremendous domestic and international

goodwill to the country for its efforts at achieving peace

and undertaking reforms to promote a dynamic economy.

How the country responds to this challenge will crucially

determine the course of the economy in the new

millennium.

World output expanded by 4.8 per cent in 2000

compared with 3.5 per cent in 1999. The rate of world

trade expansion increased from 5.1 per cent in the previous

year to 12.4 per cent in 2000. These developments created

a favourable environment for countries which were

increasingly integrating themselves into the global economy.

Sri Lanka benefitted from the robust economic growth in

USA, the continuation of growth momentum in the

European Union (EU), the economic recovery in the

Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the

improved import capacity in the Middle Eastern countries

consequent on high oil prices. These favourable

developments were instrumental in creating a strong demand

for Sri Lanka's exports. Further, the strengthening of the

currencies in most crisis affected East Asian countries

helped to improve Sri Lanka's external competitiveness.

Inflation remained low during 2000 in many regions

of the world, reflecting improved supply conditions and the

continuation of tight monetary policies, particularly in

industrial countries. Many countries attempted to contain

inflation at low levels through improved fiscal and monetary

management, while an increasing number of countries

adopted inflation targeting within their policy framework.

Oil prices increased sharply, while non-fuel commodity

prices improved marginally, causing balance of payments

difficulties in oil importing developing countries. Reflecting

these international developments, Sri Lanka's external terms

of trade weakened further by 6 per cent in 2000, the second

consecutive year of deterioration, preventing the country

from realising the full benefits of increased international

trade activities.

International financial markets remained relatively

stable in 2000, though key currencies showed volatility,

making macroeconomic management difficult for most

countries, especially for small developing economies.

Reflecting the continued buoyancy of the US economy, and

differences in growth momentum among major industrial

countries, the US dollar strengthened against all major

currencies. Foreign exchange markets in the Asian region,

except in a few crisis affected countries, showed a relative

stability, reflecting economic recovery in East Asian

countries and the continuation of high economic growth in

China and India.

Short-term interest rates were raised in industrial

countries as an anti-inflation measure. Consequently,

borrowing costs of emerging market economies from

international financial markets rose, despite improved

stability in their own economies. Meanwhile, the reversal

of the upward trend in stock prices in the information

technology (IT) sector in industrial countries had a

contagion effect on emerging market economies.

Consequently, net private capital flows into emerging

market economies declined, even though gross capital

inflows to them increased. Official development assistance

(ODA) to developing countries improved to 0.21 per cent

of gross domestic product (GDP) of OECD countries in

2000, but remained well below the UN agreed target of 0.7

per cent of GDP. Meanwhile, Asia experienced a net

outflow, partly due to the settlement of large amounts of

financial assistance received by crisis affected East Asian

countries in 1997 and thereafter.

Sri Lanka's economy recorded a real GDP growth rate

of 6 per cent in 2000, significantly above the rate of growth

of 4.3 per cent in 1999. The annual average growth rate

during the decade was 5 per cent. Gross national product

(GNP) grew by 5.8 per cent in 2000 compared with 3.8

per cent in the previous year. Economic recovery had

started in the second half of 1999 and continued through

the first three quarters of 2000, following a period of slow

down in the second half of 1998 and 1999. The high

growth in GDP, together with relatively low population

growth, raised Sri Lanka's per capita GDP to Rs.64,855

(US dollars 856) in 2000, from Rs.58,077 (US dollars 825)

in 1999. Consequently, the country's position in the

international classification moved further up within the

lower middle income category, which consists of countries

with a per capita income in the range of US dollars 795-

3,125.

Output increased in all major sectors, but

manufacturing and services sectors became the major

contributors to growth accounting for 26 per cent and 61

per cent of total growth, respectively. On the demand side,

domestic consumption, investment and exports all

contributed to the high growth in 2000. The highest

contribution came from exports of goods and services,

which accounted for 47 per cent of the growth in the

overall demand, and recorded an annual growth rate of 18

per cent in real terms in 2000. Reflecting the

implementation of a number of infrastructure development

projects by both the public sector and the private sector,

gross domestic capital formation in real terms grew by 9.5

per cent in 2000. This compares with 6.4 per cent in 1999.

On the supply side, both gross domestic production and

imports of goods and non-factor services, expanded at

higher rates in 2000 than in 1999, increasing the availability

of goods and services.

The increasing integration of the Sri Lankan economy

into the global economy has been clearly demonstrated by

the close association between domestic growth rates and the

growth momentum in the world economy in recent years.

Following the recovery path in the world economy, the

quarterly growth rate in Sri Lanka accelerated from 4 per

cent in the third quarter of 1999 to 7.4 per cent in the

second quarter of 2000. In the fourth quarter of 2000,

economic growth eased, despite continued high exports, as

poor and delayed monsoons affected agricultural output

adversely, while some pre-election uncertainty and high

interest rates had an impact on the general business

environment.

The ratio of gross domestic investment/GDP increased

to 27.3 per cent in 2000, continuing the upward trend

experienced since 1997, mainly due to increased private

sector investment activities. The relative share of private

investment in total capital accumulation increased gradually,

reaching 89 per cent, reflecting the growing role of the

private sector in the economy. Meanwhile, public sector

investments were mainly concentrated on economic and

social infrastructure development activities. The economy

also attracted foreign investors, with foreign direct

investment (FDI) inflows amounting to US dollars 175

million in 2000, despite the potential adverse impact of the

ongoing civil conflict on investor sentiments.

The development of infrastructure facilities continued

in 2000 with increased investment by both public and

private sectors to meet fast growing demand. However, the

government's investment in infrastructure facilities fell short

of expectations due to delays in project implementation and

the curtailing of capital expenditure to accommodate the

increased defence expenditure in the middle of the year.

The realised government investment, including infrastructure

development, amounted to 6.4 per cent of GDP, when

compared with a budgetary target of 8.1 per cent of GDP.

Despite this drop, a number of new large infrastructure

development projects were initiated in 2000 by the public

sector as well as the private sector, mainly in the transport,

power, telecommunication and port sectors. Over the past

few years, budgetary allocations made for education and

health have increased, enabling further improvements in the

social indicators. The percentage of households with

electricity, access to safe water, telecommunication facilities

and transport, health and education facilities improved, but

further efforts and resources are necessary to improve the

living standards of people and to remove existing

infrastructure bottlenecks constraining the achievement of a

faster economic growth.

Private savings rose to a higher rate of 20.7 per cent

of GDP, benefiting from the increased per capita incomes,

attractive positive real interest rates and increased private

remittances by Sri Lankans working abroad. However, total

domestic savings declined to 17.3 per cent of GDP due to

increased government dissaving from 1.0 per cent in 1999

to 3.4 per cent of GDP, a result of fiscal slippage in 2000.

High economic growth and expanding investment

activities generated more employment opportunities, largely

in the private sector. Consequently, the unemployment rate

declined to 7.7 per cent. Some of the new employment was

in foreign countries. This is the seventh consecutive year

in which a downward movement in the unemployment rate

has been recorded. However, unemployment still remained

high, particularly among the youth with higher education.

Meanwhile, unfilled vacancies continued to exist in some

industries, reflecting the mismatch in the labour market

between demand and supply. Nominal wages and salaries

increased in 2000, preserving real wages at the previous

year's levels in most economic sectors.

The inflation rate, which declined from the early part

of 1998 into the first half of 2000, experienced a trend

reversal in the latter part of the year, owing to upward

revisions in some administered prices following the surge

in international oil prices, increases in prices of imports

such as sugar, milk products and fertiliser, and the

depreciation of the rupee. The expansion in domestic

agricultural output improved the supply situation, thereby

mitigating the inflationary pressures to some extent. The

annual average inflation rate, measured by the increase in

the Colombo Consumers' Price Index (CCPI), was

contained at 6.2 per cent in 2000. However, on a point-to-

point basis, it rose to 10.8 per cent by December 2000 from

4

Chart 1.2

Sectoral Composition of GDP

4 per cent at end 1999 indicating growing inflationary

pressures in the economy. In this context, the Central Bank

tightened its monetary policy stance in order to neutralise

potential inflationary pressures from the aggregate demand

side and to ensure stability in the foreign exchange market.

As a part of the efforts to consolidate recent fiscal

improvements, the government in the Budget 2000

attempted to contain the overall fiscal deficit at 7.6 per cent

of GDP with a surplus in the current account of 0.6 per

cent of GDP, while reducing domestic borrowing for deficit

financing to 3.5 per cent of GDP. However, the fiscal

situation deteriorated, creating a higher deficit and increased

domestic borrowings. In place of a surplus, the current

account deficit turned out to be 3.4 per cent of GDP. The

overall fiscal deficit, excluding grants, rose to 9.9 per cent

of GDP, the highest since 1995 when the deficit was 10.1

per cent. The deficit was recorded, despite some corrective

measures taken to arrest the situation in mid 2000. This was

due to a shortfall in revenue collection from import duty

and income tax and an increase in recurrent expenditure,

mainly due to high defence expenditure and increased

interest payments.

The increased deficit, together with a delay in

completing the planned privatisation process and less than

anticipated foreign financing inflows, raised government's

domestic borrowing to 9.4 per cent of GDP, exerting strong

pressure on domestic interest rates. As available non-bank

domestic resources were limited, the government was

compelled to meet the balance resource requirement from

the banking system. Consequently, government's bank

borrowings increased by Rs 53.4 billion to 4.3 per cent of

GDP, the highest level during the last 12 years. A large

part of this (84 per cent) was reflected in borrowings from

the Central Bank, as commercial banks used the Central

Bank's reverse repurchase facility to acquire the liquidity

needed to finance private sector credit demand and

increased credit requirements of the public sector.

Borrowing by public corporations surged by Rs.25.2 billion,

mainly due to delays in effecting the price revisions needed

in response to higher world prices of oil. Thus, the

consolidated deficit of the public sector (government and

public corporations) rose to about 11.9 per cent of GDP in

2000, from about 7.8 per cent in 1999, raising domestic

credit demand and exerting pressure on interest rates.

Consequently, total government debt stock increased by Rs.167 billion (or by 16 per cent) to Rs.1,219 billion (97 per cent of GDP) at end 2000, indicating a higher debt service burden in the future. In line with the medium-term government debt management strategy, the reliance on market oriented borrowing instruments (i.e., Treasury bonds) increased, while the use of non-market oriented borrowing instruments (Rupee securities) decreased sharply in 2000.

Despite a surge in exports and increased inflows

through private transfers, the current account deficit as well

as the overall deficit in the balance of payments (BOP)

widened sharply in 2000, mainly due to significant increases

in energy and defence related imports. The current account

deficit increased to 6.4 per cent of GDP in 2000, from 3.6

per cent of GDP in 1999, while the overall BOP deficit

deteriorated to US dollars 516 million from US dollars 263

million in the previous year.

The higher BOP deficit led to a fall in the gross official reserves by 36 per cent or US dollars 596 million, to US dollars 1,043 million (1.7 months of imports) by the

5

Parti

end of 2000. However, the country's gross external reserves

declined by a smaller amount, viz., US dollars 456 million

(18 per cent) to US dollars 2,126 million (3.5 months of

imports) at the end of 2000, as external assets of

commercial banks increased by US dollars 141 million

during the year.

The increased external sector deficit and the

continuously declining international reserves exerted

pressure on the rupee to depreciate faster during the second

half of 2000. The Central Bank gradually widened the

margin between its buying and selling rates for the US

dollar, the intervention currency, to release the pressure in

the exchange market, while raising its short-term interest

rates to discourage speculative holding of foreign currency

balances. The rupee depreciated by 9.9 per cent against the

US dollar during 2000 as measured by the Central Bank's

middle rate (12.5 per cent as measured by the interbank

foreign exchange market average exchange rate), compared

with 6 per cent in 1999. Because of the weakening of other

partner and competitor country exchange rates vis-a-vis the

US dollar, the rupee depreciated only by 6.7 per cent in

nominal effective terms against a basket of 24 currencies.

However, given the higher inflation in Sri Lanka, the real

effective exchange rate (REER) recorded a marginal

appreciation of 0.6 per cent, indicating that the country's

external competitiveness remained almost the same.

The drain on the country's foreign exchange reserves arising from the increased deficit in the balance of payments led to an inevitable downward adjustment in the exchange rate, particularly during the second half of 2000. Accordingly, the Central Bank widened the margin between its buying and selling rates from 2 per cent to 5 per cent in June 2000 and again to 6 per cent in November and to 8 per cent in December, before widening it to 10 per cent in January 2001. Meanwhile, regular adjustments were made under the crawling band system by taking into account market developments. The widening of margins and regular adjustments based on market developments released the pressure in the foreign exchange market gradually, thus preventing any significant misalignment of the exchange rate with macroeconomic fundamentals, thereby avoiding a potential financial crisis as experienced in a number of developing countries, particularly in East Asia and Latin America.

However, it became clear that in the current economic

environment, regular widening of the intervention band

leads to a formation of market expectations of continuous

depreciation of the rupee, thus exerting pressure on the

official international reserves of the country. Meanwhile, the

increases in the interest rates that were effected to provide

stability in the foreign exchange market could not be

maintained for a long period, as such high interest rates

would be detrimental to financial sector soundness and

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

prospects for long-term economic growth. At the same time,

the foreign exchange market reached a level of maturity and

gained experience in determining the exchange rate in a

more flexible and competitive market environment.

The Central Bank introduced a new exchange rate

regime on 23 January 2001 by taking into account all these

factors and long-term economic prospects, as another step

forward in the evolution towards a floating exchange rate

system initiated in 1977, along with the introduction of an

outward oriented economic liberalisation framework. Under

the new system, the Central Bank refrained from

announcing its buying and selling rates for the US dollar

(i.e., the intervention currency) in advance. Instead, it

decided to participate actively in the foreign exchange

market, through buying and selling foreign exchange at or

near market prices. This provided full freedom to the

market to determine the exchange rate, while enabling the

authorities to build up the official external reserves, which,

in the long run, would bring about stability on both price

and exchange rate fronts and help achieve a sustainable

high economic growth.

The exchange rate stabilised, restoring stability in the

foreign exchange market within a short period after

experiencing a minor overshooting during the first few days.

This overshooting was not unanticipated and not excessive

compared with the experience of many other countries when

they moved from a fixed or managed system to a floating

system (for more details, see Box 1). The quick restoration

of stability was a result of the gradual release of the

pressures through the widening of the band and gradual

depreciation of the exchange rate earlier.

Developments in the external sector and on the fiscal front had significant implications for monetary management in 2000. Given the pressures on interest rates, exchange rates and external reserves by increased public sector borrowing and a higher balance of payments deficit, monetary policy in 2000 focussed on maintaining stability in the domestic financial markets, while providing adequate liquidity to facilitate economic activity. Monetary policy also sought to prevent the build up of demand fuelled inflationary pressures in the economy. Monetary policy was tightened by raising the Central Bank's short-term interest rates, particularly in the second half of 2000, to ensure financial market stability. Consequently, the Central Bank's repurchase and reverse repurchase rates were raised in several steps from 9.25 per cent and 13.48 per cent at the beginning of 2000 to 17 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively, at the end of year. Tighter monetary policy, together with increased public sector borrowings, caused market interest rates, which were on a falling path until May, to increase sharply in the second half of the year. As the sharp increase in interest rates was considered a temporary phenomenon, short-term rates increased at a

6

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

Box 1 Evolution of Exchange Rate Management in Sri Lanka

The Monetary Law Act, under which the Central Bank

of Sri Lanka was established, places on the Bank the

responsibility of maintaining the stability of the external

value of the Sri Lanka rupee in relation to foreign

currencies, in line with macro-economic fundamentals.

In the past half century, the exchange rate system of Sri

Lanka has evolved from a regime of fixed exchange

rates to a managed float and finally to an independent

float,

Fixed Exchange Rate Regime

When the Central Bank was first set up, Sri Lanka, like

most countries at that time adopted a fixed exchange

regime. The Sri Lanka rupee was linked to the pound

sterling. The fixed exchange rate system was maintained

through the 1960's and most of the 1970's, with a rigid

system of exchange controls. Throughout most of this

period, there was heavy pressure on external reserves.

The rupee was first devalued by 20 per cent in 1967 in

response to the continued depletion of reserves and

devaluation of the pound sterling. The devaluation was

supplemented with a system of dual exchange rates

introduced in 1968. Under this system, which was

known as the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificates

Scheme (FEECS), there was an 'official' exchange rate

applicable to essential imports and traditional exports,

and another higher rate, applicable to all other exports

and imports. The objective of the scheme was export

diversification and import compression by allowing the

market mechanism to regulate the flow of 'non-essential'

imports. It was designed to bring the rupee cost of a

wide range of such imports closer to the realistic value

of foreign exchange.

With the suspension of the convertibility of the US

dollar for gold in August 1971 by the United States, the

rupee was linked to the US dollar at the prevailing

parity of Rs. 5.9524 per US dollar, allowing the parities

against other currencies to be determined on the basis

of their cross rates with the US dollar in international

foreign exchange markets. The Sri Lanka rupee was

linked to the pound sterling from 10 July 1972, at the

prevailing parity of Rs. 14.94, following the flotation of

die pound sterling in June 1972. Sri Lanka moved from

a hard peg to a single currency, to a basket peg in May

1976, by determining the exchange rate with reference

to an appropriately weighted basket of currencies. This

step was necessitated by the need to insulate the rupee

from random events abroad, which, under the previous

regime, tended to be transmitted to Sri Lanka, via the

link between the rupee and the pound sterling. With the

use of a basket of currencies in the determination of the

exchange rate, there was greater scope for the effects of

underlying trends in the Sri Lankan economy to be

represented in Sri Lanka's exchange rates vis a vis other

currencies. The exchange rate was gradually re-adjusted

under a crawling peg system between August and mid

November 1977, allowing it to reflect changes in macro-

economic fundamentals with the intention of finding a

more realistic rate of exchange for the rupee.

Managed Float with a Crawling Band

In November 1977, Sri Lanka made a major shift from

restrictive policies towards a liberal policy regime with

the partial liberalisation of external trade and payments.

The dual exchange rate system was abolished by

introducing a unified exchange rate, which was initially

depreciated by 46 per cent. With unification, the

exchange rate was allowed to float, providing scope for

the exchange rate to be determined largely on the basis

of demand and supply in the market. At the initial stage

of floating, the Central Bank's management of the

exchange rate was considered essential, as the foreign

exchange market was thin and the financial system was

not mature enough to operate on its own. Accordingly,

the Central Bank announced daily the rates at which it

would buy and sell foreign exchange from and to the

market within a narrow band.

Under the managed floating system, the Central Bank initially quoted fixed daily rates for six major currencies. However, after 1982, the Bank limited its quotations only to the intervention currency, the US dollar, allowing the commercial banks to determine the cross rates for other currencies based on market conditions. At the beginning, the margin between the buying and selling rates maintained by the Central Bank was Rs. 6.00 per US dollars 100. This was adjusted on several occasions as shown in Table 1 and finally revised to 10 per cent in January 2001, allowing market forces greater scope to determine the exchange rate, with the domestic foreign exchange market gaining a greater degree of maturity. With the liberalisation of the exchange rate under the managed float system, the country also liberalised its payments system and by March 1994, it had removed all restrictions on current external transactions and accepted Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement of the IMF. Capital account

7

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

transactions were also largely liberalised, except for

restrictions on investment abroad and borrowing abroad

by residents, and investment in domestic debt

instruments by non-residents.

Changes in 2000

An increased balance of payments deficit, largely due to

high oil import prices and security related additional

imports, resulted in a reduction in official foreign

reserves in 2000 and there were expectations that

external reserves would decline further. In this

background, there was pressure on the exchange rate and

the Central Bank was faced with a major challenge in

managing the exchange rate with the crawling band.

Since the declaration of the government in May 2000

that the country was on a war footing, the market had

expected heavy expenditure by the government, which,

together with rising petroleum prices and declining

reserves, generated a market expectation of a rupee

depreciation. Exporters started to hold onto their foreign

exchange earnings and finance their operations through

rupee funds, while importers advanced their operations

and started forward bookings for imports. In order to

cover both spot and forward sales to customers

commercial banks too intensified their buying in the spot

market. As a result of these developments, the market

exchange rate started operating around the Central

Bank's selling rate most of the time, requiring the Bank

to sell foreign exchange to defend the exchange rate.

The Central Bank responded to this by widening the

spread between its buying and selling rates and

increasing its interest rate on several instances during

2000. Accordingly, the Central Bank widened the

margin between its buying and selling rates of foreign

exchange from 2 per cent to 5 per cent in June 2000

and further to 6 per cent in November and 8 per cent

in December before widening it to 10 per cent in

January 2001.

The widening of margins in this manner and regular

adjustment of the exchange rate, by taking into account

market developments, permitted a reduction of pressure

in the foreign exchange market, thus avoiding a financial

crisis as experienced in a number of developing

countries, particularly in East Asia and Latin America.

However, the Central Bank observed that in the current

economic environment, regular widening of the

intervention band may lead to a formation of market

expectations of continuous depreciation of the rupee,

thus exerting an unnecessary pressure on the official

external reserves of the country. At the same time, the

Box 1 (Contd.)

increases in interest rates that were effected to provide

stability in the exchange market could not be maintained

for a long period, as high interest rates would be

detrimental to economic activity in the long run.

New Exchange Rate Regime

On 23 January 2001, Sri Lanka took a major step

forward in the liberalisation of foreign exchange

transactions by allowing commercial banks to determine

the exchange rate fjeely. The Bank no longer

announced its buying and selling rates in advance.

Instead, it indicated that it would participate actively in

buying and selling at or near market prices. The new

system permitted freer transactions in the market, while

stabilising the value of the rupee and helping authorities

to build up official foreign assets. The experience of

other countries that have floated their currencies have

highlighted the need for implementing precautionary

measures, during the transition period, to help and

stabilise the market and promote prudential conduct by

commercial banks by restraining speculative activity.

Therefore, the Central Bank also implemented the

following temporary measures in consultation with

commercial banks and foreign exchange dealers.

• Limits on daily working balances maintained by

commercial banks in foreign exchange, on the

basis of past export-import credit facilities

granted by the banks, to prevent banks from

building up foreign exchange for unwarranted

speculative activities.

• Requesting banks to ensure settlement of export

credit by exporters by using export proceeds

within 90 days. This period was extended to

120 days in respect of exports, where it was

customary to grant 120 days' deferred payment

terms to buyers. Higher interest was to be

charged, when settlement became overdue.

• Requesting banks to limit their forward market

operations only to trade related transactions.

• Requiring forward sales and purchases of foreign

exchange to be backed by a rupee deposit of 50

per cent, to discourage speculative forward

contracting.

• Advising banks not to permit early or pre­

payment of import bills, in anticipation of a

depreciation.

As expected, these measures helped to create

stability in the foreign exchange market. They are

8

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

expected to,be.relaxed.gradually and removed once the

foreign exchange market reached a desirable state of

stability.

Immediately with the change in the exchange rate

regime, an overshooting of the rate was expected and

did occur, as experienced in a number of other countries.

The rupee depreciated gradually during the first two

days, but overshot on the third day, even recording some

transactions at Rs.98 per US dollar. However, the

market correction process for the overreaction started on

the same day arid the, rate stabilised around Rs.88.90 per

US dollar within a week's time. The weighted average-

exchange rate in the spot market recorded a depreciation

of 9.1 per cent on 25 January 2001 compared with the

pre-float level, but the rate of depreciation declined to

1 per cent by 7 March 2001. Similarly, the spread

between buying and selling rates of foreign currencies

has narrowed drastically in the inter-bank foreign

exchange market as well as in commercial bank

transactions with customers. This was a relatively quick

stabilisation of the exchange rate compared with the

experience of other countries that floated their exchange

rates. For example, Brazil's currency depreciated by 40

per cent on the first day of floating and 21 per cent in

. the first month of floating in January 1999. The Indian

rupee depreciated by 16 per cent in the first month of

floating in March 1993, the Korean won by 31 per cent

in the first month of floating in December 1997 and the

Swedish kroner by 28 per cent in the first five months

of floating in 1992.

Chart 1 Inter-bank Rate

Box 1 (Contd.)

The following main factors have contributed to

achieving faster stability in the market.

• Release of pressure in the foreign exchange

market gradually through regular adjustments of

the exchange rate according to changes in macro-

* economic fundamentals of the country and

widening of the band over a longer period to

allow more flexibility in the market.

• Timely and effective implementation of

precautionary measures with the introduction of

the new regime.

• Safeguards provided by high interest rate policy

and continuation of capital controls.

• Cordial and close relationship between market

participants and the authorities.

The new system has already halted the drain on

official foreign reserves and will help to build them to

a more comfortable level. In addition, with the

restoration of stability in the exchange, market, the

Central Bank would be in a position to gradually reduce

its interest rate, too. As a first step, the,Central Bank

reduced its repo and reverse repo rates by 1 percentage

point on 26 February 2000, and by 50 basis points on

3 April 2001.

It is also encouraging that the market is already,

developing its own strategies arid instruments to settle

large import bills, such as petroleum, without resorting

to the Central Bank for foreign exchange reserves as

under the previous regime. Under the present exchange

rate regime, it is not necessary for the Bank to use

monetary policy to defend the exchange rate, as the

exchange rate is not considered a nominal anchor. The

Bank could now welHarget its monetary policy to

achieve the prime objectives of price stability and

financial system stability. However, the Central Bank

will intervene in the market to prevent excessive

fluctuations in the exchange rate but will not attempt to

defend any particular level of exchange rate. The new

system will also improve market confidence and the

country's external competitiveness, encouraging investors,

both domestic and foreign, and expanding the capacity

of the economy to achieve higher growth and create

more employment opportunities in the future.

After 3 November 2000, it was computed from the buying rate:

faster rate than the medium and long-term rates, thereby

flattening the yield curve for government securities.

In order to promote foreign currency deposits and

improve liquidity in the foreign exchange market, the

statutory reserve requirement (11 per cent) on foreign

currency deposits that had not been placed abroad was

removed in August 2000. By taking advantage of this

measure and responding to rising interest rates in major

international markets, commercial banks raised their interest

rates on foreign currency deposits to attract deposits.

Monetary expansion remained at around 13 per cent in

2000, despite the sharp rise in public sector bank

borrowings, mainly due to a reduction in the net foreign

assets of the banking system. High interest rates helped to

contain expansion of domestic credit and, hence, to contain

monetary expansion in line with the increase in nominal

income.

Despite an increase in net credit to the government

from the Central Bank by about Rs.45 billion or 96 per

cent, reserve money expanded at a moderate rate of 4.7 per

cent in 2000 compared with an 8.2 per cent increase in

1999 on account of a sharp decline in the net foreign assets

of the monetary authority by Rs.31 billion.

Commercial bank credit to the private sector increased

by 12 per cent (Rs.38 billion) mainly catering to the

increased demand for credit from the service, commercial

and manufacturing sectors. Increased corporate sector

liquidity with a declining trend in effective tax rates, resort

to new low-cost financing instruments such as commercial

paper and the availability of credit facilities from the

development banks may have reduced private sector demand

for commercial bank credit. According to the financial

survey, credit to the private sector rose by Rs.48 billion (11

per cent). Net credit to the government rose significantly

by Rs.53 billion (57 per cent), of which Rs.45 billion (84

per cent) came from the Central Bank. Meanwhile, credit

extended to public corporations rose by Rs.25 billion,

mainly caused by heavy borrowings by the Ceylon

Petroleum Corporation (CPC), the Ceylon Electricity Board

(CEB) and the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment

(CWE). Consequently, the total public sector borrowings

rose sharply by Rs.78 billion (73 per cent), accounting for

over 142 per cent of the monetary expansion in 2000.

Share prices and the turnover in the Colombo Stock

Exchange (CSE) remained depressed, despite healthy

earnings by several listed companies and the strong

economic recovery. At end 2000, the All Share Price Index

was 22 per cent below the value at end 1999. This decline

could be attributed mainly to the political uncertainty that

prevailed before the General Elections in October 2000, the

uncertainty that prevailed in the foreign exchange market

and the high interest rates on fixed income securities.

However, the continuation of a declining trend in share

market activities over a period of 3 years, despite a

recovery in the economy and improving corporate sector

performance, indicates the necessity for reviewing the

market structure and institutional framework of the capital

market, which, in the long run, would be crucial for private

sector led economic growth.

Financial sector facilities and services continued to

improve in a competitive environment. With the expansion

of bank branches, banking density improved. The

availability of modern services such as automated teller

machines (ATM), credit cards and tele-banking facilities

expanded. All these encouraged financial intermediation and

hence increasing financial deepening in the economy.

Further steps were taken to improve rural banking and

credit facilities and expand private forward sales contract

facilities for agricultural products, introduced in 1999.

However, the continuation of high interest spread by banks

calls for further improvements in efficiency and reforms in

the financial sector.

Structural reforms in the financial sector haye been

continued even under difficult conditions, but the progress

was slow in a number of crucial areas. Limits on foreign

ownership in commercial banks and in the insurance

business were raised in 2000, to 60 per cent and 90 per

cent, respectively, with a view to further improving their

capital base arid encouraging modernisation of financial

services. The Central Bank continued to strengthen its

monitoring and supervision of financial sector activities. The

capacity of the Central Bank's bank supervision has been

improved by increasing the number of qualified supervisors

and their ability to process and analyse data collected from

banks more speedily and effectively. The risk adjusted

capital adequacy ratio for banks was raised to a minimum

of 9 per cent from January 2001, with a pre-announced

time-plan of raising it further to a minimum of 10 per cent

in January 2002, in order to improve the resilience of the

banking system. Commercial banks have improved their

credit evaluations, recovery processes and loan provisioning.

However, despite a recent decline in the ratio of non-

performing loans (NPL) to total advances, it is still high

(15 per cent), indicating the necessity for adopting more

effective measures for loan recovery. Progress has also been

made in improving the management in the two state banks

and action has been initiated to restructure the Ministry of

Finance and to modernise the Central Bank.

During the year, further steps were taken to improve

the government debt securities market. The primary dealer

network was strengthened by reducing the number of

dealers to eight public limited liability companies, with

dedicated capital, appointed as Primary Dealers. This is

expected to provide a level playing field for primary dealer

activity, facilitate dealer surveillance and strengthen public

debt management. The infrastructure necessary for a dealer

Box 2 Fifty Years of Central Banking in Sri Lanka

With the regaining of independence in 1948, a need was

felt for a monetary regime that would foster stability,

growth and development in Sri Lanka. In order to fulfill

this need, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) was

established and commenced operations on 28 August

1950. During the past fifty years, the Central Bank has

evolved and undergone various changes based on the

needs of the people and forces of economic growth and

development.

Prior to the establishment of the CBSL, the

monetary regime that prevailed in Sri Lanka was the

Currency Board System, established in 1884 under the

Paper Currency Ordinance of 1884. A currency board

has some strengths and operates well in an environment

of stable balance of payments. However, it has several

weaknesses which made the authorities view it as being

unsuitable for a country that had become independent

and was seeking to develop its economy.. Among the

weaknesses were the requirement of a 100 per cent

reserve base, the automatic link between international

reserves and money supply, and the manner in which the

exchange rate was determined. Hence, a change in the

system was deemed Accessary.

In 1949, at the invitation of the government. Mr.

John Exter, an economist of the Federal Reserve System

of the United States, began preparing a report on the

financial and economic conditions of Sri Lanka and the

feasibility of establishing a central bank. He

recommended the creation of a new independent

monetary system and presented a draft Monetary Law

Bill incorporating legislation for the setting up of CBSL.

The Bill became the Monetary Law Act No. 58 of 1949,

and the Central Bank of Ceylon was established under

this Act. The newly established Central Bank became the

authority responsible for the administration and

regulation of the monetary and the banking system of

Sri Lanka. The Bank was charged with the duty of

regulating the supply, availability, cost and international

exchange of money so as to secure, as far as possible,

by action authorised by the Act, the following

objectives;

(a) the stabilisation of domestic monetary values:

(b) if there has been a determination of the par

value of the Sri Lanka rupee, the preservation

of the par value of the Sri Lanka rupee and

the free use of the rupee for current

international transactions; if there has been no

determination of the par value of the Sri Lanka

rupee, the preservation of the stability of the

exchange rate of Sri Lanka rupee in relation

to foreign currencies;

c) the promotion and maintenance of a high value

of production, employment and real income in

Sri Lanka; and,

d) the encouragement and promotion of full

development of productive resources of Sri

Lanka.

By design, a central bank's activities are unique.

Its ability to uniquely influence the money supply in the

economy and the financial structure is harnessed in

monetary policy to achieve the above objectives. The

first objective implies low and stable inflation and the

second objective implies stable exchange rates, while the

third and fourth objectives ensure economic growth and

development.

Exter (1949) further assumed that the establishment

of the central bank would greatly strengthen the banking

system. CBSL would have the power to examine, and

supervise banking institutions to avoid bank failures and

would stand ready to advance credit as the 'lender of

last resort' and thus make the banking system 'almost

invulnerable' in times of crises. Strengthening the

banking system would encourage the public to make

greater use of financial markets as depositories for their

savings, thus enabling banks to lend to many.

Apart from fulfilling fundamental objectives, Exter

also believed that the Central Bank could do a great deal

to introduce more effective management of the public

debt and more efficient handling of public finances by

acting as the government's fiscal agent, banker and

financial adviser. He also emphasised the need for

development finance by advocating that the Central Bank

should have the authority to lend to institutions other

than commercial banks, such as mortgage lending

institutions and the co-operative credit movement, as

they have made greater credit facilities available to the

sectors for which institutional credit is lacking, and also

by advocating that the Central Bank should engage in

12

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

loan insurance and loan guarantees. He believed that by

helping to direct savings, credit and foreign resources

into agricultural development and new industries,

diversification of the economy could be stimulated,

which would make it more resilient and adaptable to

changing economic conditions. Over the next five

decades, many of these functions became integral parts

of the Bank's operations.

., The evolution of departments in CBSL kept pace

with the evolution of its monetary policy and expansion

of other activities (Table 1). At its inception, CBSL had

only a few key departments, among which were

Banking, Economic Research and the Secretariat. The

Economic Research Department provided research inputs

and the Banking Department carried out the

implementation of the monetary policy, in addition to

carrying out functions as the banker to the government

and banker to banks. CBSL also inherited several

functions as the agent of the government. Those were

exchange control and managing the public debt, and two

departments were established to carry out these

functions.

Financial sector development and stability

became a prime function of CBSL with the

establishment of the Bank Supervision Department in

1951. Since then, achieving this objective has been

further strengthened by establishing the Non-Bank

Financial Institutions Supervision Department in 1988

and Financial Markets Department in 1997. With the

enactment of the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) Act

in 1958, which required CBSL to be the custodian of

•EPF funds, the EPF Department was established in 1958.

In the sixties and seventies, as the economic

philosophy moved more towards centralisation and direct

government intervention, greater emphasis was given to

the development objective. Controls and concessions

were used to direct credit and resources to priority

sectors chosen by the government. In the mid 1970s,

CBSL performed a more direct role in economic

development. In order to assist in this, the Department

of Development Finance was established in 1974 to

grant directed and subsidised credit to the industrial and

agricultural sectors. CBSL also played a prominent role

in the establishing and developing the institutional

structure needed to carry but the development finance

function in the economy. In this regard, it helped

establish a number of independent institutions such as

Box 2 (Contd.)

the DFCC Bank and the National Development Bank.

In order to strengthen the Bank's activities in the field

of rural credit, the Rural Credit Department was

established in 1981. This Department, together with the

Development Finance Department, served as a national

level co-ordinating body for implementing various

development programmes. Regional Offices of CBSL

were established between. 1981 - 1985 to facilitate

development finance in rural areas and promote regional

growth. As part of this process, the CBSL was

instrumental in setting up Regional Rural Development

Banks from 1985 onwards.

Fundamental changes were seen after the

liberalisation of the economy in 1977 away from direct

controls to market based tools. The fixed exchange rate

system that had prevailed until then, was changed to a

managed float in 1977. The market has been given

greater flexibility over the years and in early 2001, Sri

Lanka moved to a free float of the rupee. The

management of the exchange rate helped to achieve a

gradual depreciation which maintained the

competitiveness of Sri Lanka's external trade and

avoided major exchange crises.

The Central Bank began to reduce gradually its

use of direct controls and interventions in the

implementation of monetary policy and to move towards

more market based, indirect tools of monetary policy.

This required the CBSL to involve itself in the

development of the financial market and market

instruments, particularly in the development of the

government securities market.

In the late 1980s and 1990s, the Bank's

involvement in development finance and rural credit

declined as other institutions developed to deal with

these areas. The involvement in directing credit was also

phased out, giving greater flexibility to commercial

banks and development banks to determine their lending

policies. The provision of refinance using CBSL

resources was terminated in view of the market

distortionary nature of such refinance.

The critical importance of financial sector

stability for sustainable economic development and

growth has become more evident over the years. CBSL

has therefore strengthened its functions as the institution

responsible for financial sector stability. A two pronged

approach has been adopted in this regard. On the one

hand, the Bank reduced its direct controls and

encouraged market growth, often being closely involved

in the development of new institutions and instruments.

On the other, it strengthened its supervisory and

regulatory role, both by enhancing its own competence

in these areas and by assisting In the creation of a legal

framework that would be conducive to orderly

development of the financial market.

' Over the past fifty years, the Central Bank has

occupied a vital place in the financial and economic

structure of Sri Lanka. Its role has evolved and changed

as the needs of the country and the economic conditions

world-wide altered. As it moves into the future further

changes are likely. The world-wide experience in the

past few decades has been that central banks can "best

serve their countries by concentrating on maintaining

price stability and ensuring stability in the financial

sector. Hence, the objectives of the Central Bank will

focus more closely on maintaining domestic price

stability and the stability of the financial sector, even

though the need to have regard to overall economic

development will not be ignored. Monetary policy will

be more active, and increasingly implemented through

market based instruments'. As the exchange rate has been

floated, monetary policy will be better able to focus on

domestic price stability. The supervisory and regulatory

framework will be strengthened to ensure that financial

sector stability is preserved and Sri Lanka's financial

institutions are able to compete at a global level by

meeting international prudential norms.

surveillance system also came into being during the year.

The surveillance will ensure that these institutions operate

in a sound and efficient manner.

With regard to capital market reforms, in terms of

administrative changes, some significant changes to the

listing rules and internal systems and procedures relating to

listings on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) took place

in 2000. A major change implemented related to the

removal of merit based listing rules in favour of a

disclosure-based approach in evaluating listing applications.

Steps have also been taken to reduce the cost of listing

significantly. These changes are expected to make the CSE

more efficient.

Reforms have also been initiated in education and

health services. The implementation of reforms in the health

sector, based on the recommendations of the Presidential

Task Force on Health, commenced in 1998 and progressed

well in 2000. Meanwhile, the private sector involvement in

providing health care facilities continued to expand in 2000.

Out of 17 hospital projects that had been approved by the

BOI, 3 major hospital projects have already taken off the

ground and are at various stages of development.

Educational reforms, encompassing all areas of primary,

secondary and tertiary education, have been introduced to

improve the quality of education and prepare students to

meet emerging new demands in the labour market.

Sri Lanka, like many other developing countries, is

progressing on the path of globalisation by gradually

removing barriers to trade and investment, while

establishing necessary regulatory and supervisory

mechanisms and implementing measures required to ensure

stability. The process of global integration of product and

factor markets is not new and has become an inevitable part

of economic development in the modern era. Throughout

most of its. history, Sri Lanka has been an important part

of the international trade network. Globalisation benefits

countries mainly by allowing access to a global consumer

base and resources. It benefits small countries like Sri

Lanka, as they can gain from economies of scale in

production, facilitated by access to large markets. It also

allows countries to identify inefficient economic activities

and replace them with more productive activities. However,

to reap the full benefits of globalisation and to avoid its

harmful effects, a country should implement a wide range

of regulatory and supervisory measures, such as financial

sector regulation and supervision, anti-trust legislation

incorporating measures against dumping and predatory

pricing and other internationally recognised measures such

as action against money laundering. At the same time,

excessive resistance to the process of globalisation will

marginalise countries, retarding economic development and

causing them to lag behind countries that have succeeded

in integrating themselves with globalisation.

1.2 Output

After slower growth in 1998 and early 1999, GDP, in real terms, grew by 6 per cent in 2000 benefiting from improved resilience in the economy resulting from improved macroeconomic management, structural reforms and a more favourable external economic environment. GNP, defined as GDP adjusted for net factor income from abroad, grew by 5.8 per cent compared with 3.8 per cent in 1999. This growth rate is noteworthy as it was achieved in the midst of several hostile events, which affected economic activity adversely. The first was the sharp rise in international oil prices which raised the import bill of crude oil and petroleum products by about Rs.30 billion (US dollars 400 million), i.e., 12 per cent of the total import bill or 17 per cent of total export earnings. The second was an increase in defence expenditure of Rs.21.9 billion over the original budgetary estimate for 2000 due to the escalation of the war, from the middle of the year. This expanded defence related imports by about Rs.15 billion (US dollars 200 million). Thirdly, unusually low rainfall in the catchment areas reduced the hydropower generation increasing the dependency on costly thermal generation. Fourthly, the delay in the privatisation process due to depressed international market conditions in the telecommunication industry compelled the government to resort to higher

domestic borrowing than expected under the original

budgetary estimates.

GDP at current market prices rose by 13.5 per cent to

Rs. 1,256 billion in 2000, while GNP rose to Rs. 1,234

billion. With a mid year population of 19.36 million, this

indicated an increase of 11.3 per cent in per capita GNP

to Rs.63,752 (US dollars 841) in 2000 from Rs.57,256 (US

dollars 813) in 1999. When adjustment is made for price

increases, per capita national income rose by 4.6 per cent

in real terms in 2000, further improving the average living

conditions of Sri Lankans.

The economic recovery was, reflected in all major

sectors, particularly in the expansion in export oriented

agricultural and manufacturing sectors and related support

services such as trade, transport and utilities. On the

production side, the largest growth contribution came from

the expansion in Services sector (61 per cent), followed by

Manufacturing (26 per cent) and Agriculture (6 per cent).

Consequently, the shares of the Services and Manufacturing

sectors in GDP rose to 54 per cent and 17 per cent,

respectively, while the share of the Agriculture sector

declined to 21 per cent.

Agriculture

Agriculture sector output performance was mixed in 2000.

Tea and coconut production increased to new record high

levels, but the output of rubber, paddy and certain other

field crops dropped. Reflecting the net impact of these

diverse developments, the overall growth rate of the

Agriculture sector decelerated from 4.5 per cent in 1999 to

1.8 per cent in 2000, the lowest since 1996.

Continuing the upward trend since 1993, tea production rose to a new record level of 306 million kg in 2000, surpassing the 300 million kg mark for the first time. This was mainly an outcome of favourable weather conditions, increased fertiliser application and favorable tea prices in the wake of a drop in production in Kenya and recovery in demand from Russia/CIS countries and the Middle Eastern markets. The outcome was encouraged by the improvement in tea prices, the annual average price at the Colombo Auctions improving by 18 per cent to Rs. 135.53 per kg, continuing the upward trend started in mid 1999.

Production increases in all three elevational categories

contributed to the improved performance, but the main

contribution came from the low elevation category. The

smallholder sector, accounting for 60 per cent of total

output, recorded a 12 per cent growth over 1999, compared

with a 2 per cent growth in the production under regional

plantation companies. The average yield per hectare in the

smallholdings sector (2,216 kg) is almost close to double

the average yield in the larger scale plantation sector under

management companies. These significant differences

15

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

indicate the potential for improving productivity in the

plantations under the privatised regional management

companies, particularly by reinvesting the current surpluses,

generated by apparently cyclically high prices in the

international market, to improve productivity.

The volume of tea exports in 2000 increased by 7 per

cent to 288 million kg, making Sri Lanka the world's

largest tea exporter for the fourth consecutive year. Russia

continued to be the largest buyer of Sri Lankan tea, while

UAE, Syria and Turkey were other leading buyers. Bulk tea

exports accounted for 63 per cent of total tea exports, while

the share of value added tea exports remained at 37 per

cent, indicating the potential for further improvement of

export earnings from value added tea exports.

Despite an improvement in prices during the latter half

of 2000, rubber output declined by 10 per cent, reaching

the lowest production level reported during the last 50

years. The depressed prices that prevailed in the recent past

have had a negative impact on maintenance and fertiliser

application and even led to the abandoning of tapping in

marginal lands, where, as reported, even the cost of tapping

could not be recovered. Meanwhile, growing demand for

rubber trees as timber and lands for real estate development

has reduced the extent under rubber cultivation. However,

the domestic consumption of rubber in the industrial sector

continued its upward trend, reaching 63 per cent of

domestic rubber production in 2000. Rubber exports as

intermediate goods declined by 23 per cent in 2000 due

both to a production decline and increased domestic demand

from the rubber-based manufacturing sector, while the

international rubber prices remained low due to poor

demand. During the year, there have been some attempts

by Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia to arrest deteriorating

international rubber prices.

Coconut production, which increased by 8 per cent to reach 3,055 million nuts in 2000, was the best output ever on record. Apparently, favorable weather conditions and high price expectations led to increased fertiliser application in 1999, which caused this record output. Predictably, however, the increased supply and a decline in world edible oil prices, together with the capacity limitation of domestic coconut oil and desiccated coconut (DC) industries, caused a steep drop in prices. Almost all DC mills operated at full capacity recording a 32 per cent increase in production, while coconut oil production rose by 27 per cent in 2000. However, export earnings in dollar terms declined by 9 per cent, despite an overall increase in export volume by 31 per cent.

Paddy production decreased marginally in 2000, despite

an increase in yield, due to a decline in extents sown and

harvested. The increasing trend in the average paddy yield

continued for the fourth consecutive year, largely due to an

increase in extent sown and harvested in irrigated areas

where the average yield is higher. Farmers continued to

face difficulties in marketing their paddy not only due to

seasonal price declines, but also as a result of the rice

imports under a lower tariff that prevailed during the latter

part of 1999. The seasonal paddy prices threatened to

decline sharply, compelling the government to intervene in

the market through purchases by semi-government co­

operative organisations. Evidently, the depressed prices that

prevailed during the Maha harvest (early 1999) discouraged

the application of fertiliser.

Other agricultural crops displayed a mixed

performance. Of the export oriented crops, pepper, cocoa

and cinnamon recorded increases in output 2000, while

others such as coffee and cloves, recorded production

declines. The production of these minor export crops has

increased considerably in recent years and their export

earnings have exceeded the combined earnings from

coconut and rubber exports since 1999.

Meanwhile, among subsidiary food crops, potatoes and

ground nuts showed higher output levels while the

production of big onions, chillies, black gram, green gram,

sesame and maize decreased. However, vegetable and fruit

production increased by about 5 per cent in 2000,

considerably moderating the pressures on the cost of living.

Exports of vegetables and fruits have been expanding in the

recent past, encouraged by the emergence of new wholesale

markets and widespread price dissemination, which enable

producers to obtain more remunerative prices. Commercial

scale cultivation is at present limited to a few varieties such

as gherkins, pineapple, banana and rambutan. Exports may

be encouraged by efficient forward contracting. Schemes for

forward selling produce have been introduced and are

reported to be gaining in popularity. A major problem is

the high percentage of losses during post harvest handling

(as high as 40 - 50 per cent in the case of vegetables and

fruits). The government has set up an Institute called the

Institute of Post Harvest Technology (IPHT) at

Anuradhapura to carry out research and develop new

technologies to minimise such losses. However, it may be

useful to encourage the private sector to engage itself in

developing good practices of post harvest handling of

produce. Another serious problem is the relative scarcity of

high quality seed for almost all crops. The discontinuance

of the government regulation of the seed industry and the

privatisation of government seed farms are welcome, but the

nascent private activity may need to access high cost

modern technology of commercial seed production.

Manufacturing

The output of the Manufacturing sector grew by 9.2 per

cent in 2000, compared with 4.4 per cent in 1999,

benefiting from favorable external sector demand, conducive

domestic economic conditions and policies, application of

16

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

modern technology and improved management. The growth

of industrial output during the first three-quarters of the

year was as high as 12.5 per cent, but moderated to 6.7

per cent in the last quarter of the year. It is noteworthy that

the output of factory industries, which grew by 11 per cent,

accounted for 81 per cent of the manufacturing sector

output and for 23 per cent of the overall economic growth

in 2000. The processing of tea, rubber and coconut recorded

a modest growth of 4.2 per cent, despite a record output

of tea and coconut, owing to a contraction in the rubber

processing industry and capacity limitation in coconut

processing. It is tentatively estimated that the small

industries sector recorded an expansion of 5.5 per cent

during the year.

The main contributors to the healthy industrial sector

growth were the export-oriented industries led by the

apparel and textile industry, which grew by 16.2 per cent

in volume terms and contributed 59 per cent of the

industrial sector growth in 2000. The export prices of

garments, as reflected in the average customs values, have

increased by 5.3 per cent, reflecting the increasing share of

high value added non-quota exports. Exporters were able

to expand their customer base in international markets and

obtain more orders with improvements in information

technology, modernised equipment and streamlined quota

allocation.

Industries catering mainly to the domestic market

showed a mixed performance with higher output in soft

drinks, milk products, processed meat, biscuits, hard liquor,

petroleum, chemicals, fabricated metals, building materials,

and soap and detergents. Meanwhile, increased consumer

spending, together with active advertising, attractive

packaging, improved quality and improved distribution and

marketing increased the domestic demand for these

products. However, the output of sugar, tobacco products,

PVC products, batteries and metal products declined in

2000, owing to a variety of causes. High taxation and

growth of unofficial competing markets dampened prospects

for beer and tobacco products. Many others were adjusting

to increased foreign and local competition.

In an increasingly competitive environment, adoption

of modern technology appears to have improved the

competitive edge of many local industries. The fiscal

incentives offered under the Advanced Technology

Programme have encouraged industrialists to modernise

their production processes. A lower incidence of strikes and

work stoppages, uninterrupted electricity supply and

improvement of industrial infrastructure also helped

manufacturers to expand their output and reduce costs. They

also benefited from sub-contracting, out-sourcing parts of

production, improved management of working capital under

high interest costs, reduction of wastage, re-use of waste

materials and use of energy saving methods.

On the policy front, the government continued to

encourage private sector export oriented industries by

widening access to foreign markets and developing

infrastructure facilities. The removal of quota restrictions for

apparel exports to the European market from January 2001

and the Indo-Lanka Free Trade Agreement have opened up

vast markets, which await exploitation.

Infrastructure and Services

Government continued to invest heavily in economic

infrastructure such as transport, energy, and communication,

although the investment fell short of expectations during

2000, owing to a curtailment of capital expenditure to

accommodate increased security related expenditure.

Meanwhile, the government encouraged private sector

participation in infrastructure projects. The private sector

has been responding favourably, expanding its involvement

in infrastructure development, particularly in the areas of

power generation, port development, telecommunications,

transportation, health and housing construction. The

possibility of private sector participation in the water sector

is also under consideration.

Passenger transport mileage increased with the help of

an increase in the fleet of buses and 15 new diesel multiple

units added to the railways in 2000. With the acquisition

of three new aircraft, the performance of the SriLankan

Airlines continued to improve, despite the slowdown in

tourist arrivals. Sri Lanka Railways improved its scale of

operations, but continued to incur large losses, exacerbating

the fiscal deficit. This clearly indicates the necessity of

implementing the long overdue railway reforms, including

a fare increase, which is linked to service improvement.

Longer term reforms will have to consider the viability of

service lines, which may be facilitated by private sector

participation. The construction of the long awaited

Colombo-Katunayake expressway commenced in 2000. The

government is keen to commence the construction of several

key expressways such as the Southern highway

(Colombo - Matara) and the Colombo - Kandy highway.

Completion of the proposed circular by-pass highway

around Colombo could greatly ease the growing road

congestion in the capital city.

Electricity generation grew by 11 per cent, consequent on increased investment in the power sector and an annual average increase in demand of about 10 per cent. Capacity in power generation expanded by 5 per cent to 1,779 MW with the commissioning of the first 60 MW barge mounted power plant and installation of the 21 MW Lakdhanavi II thermal power plant. Consequently, dependence on hydro-power dropped further to 65 per cent, reducing the vulnerability of power generation to vagaries of the weather, but raising the cost of generation. Growing system losses, which are now as high as 22 per cent, heavy losses of the

17

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

CEB, risks of power cuts due to poor rainfall and

distortionary cross-price subsidisation indicate the need for

urgent power sector reforms. In this context, the envisaged

reforms consisting of unbundling of power generation,

transmission and distribution, improvements in procurement

systems, introduction of an automatic price (tariff)

adjustment system and the development of efficient

regulatory systems would be helpful. The resolution of

conflicts between power generation and protecting the

environment, on the basis of an acceptable level of

pollution, could also help prevent power shortages.

Large losses in the Petroleum Corporation has raised

its outstanding debt to about Rs.25 billion at the end of

2000. This indicates the necessity of introducing petroleum

sector reforms, including the introduction of an automatic

price adjustment mechanism in order to respond to

international oil price changes in a timely manner. The

liberalisation of the petroleum industry to improve

competition and minimise waste and costs would not only

help consumers but also encourage new investment in areas

such as bunkering.

A massive improvement has taken place in

telecommunication services since the liberalisation of the

telecommunications sector. The strong growth in the

telecommunications sector was supported by the competition

from private sector operators and the partnership of Sri

Lanka Telecom with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone

(NTT) of Japan. The subscriber base of telephone services,

including mobile telephones, exceeded one million in 2000,

further increasing the telephone density in the country to

6.3 per 100 persons. Meanwhile, improvement and

modernisation of telecommunication technologies and

introduction and expansion of new services such as Internet,

e-mail and video-conference facilities not only increased

available services to customers, but also improved the

quality of communication services. By end 2000, there were

37 telecommunication system operators, including 3

companies providing fixed access telephone facilities and 4

companies providing mobile services, enhancing competition

in the sector.

In view of tremendous developments in international

communications in recent years, it is of paramount

importance for Sri Lanka to modernise its systems to the

best international standards, if it wishes to develop a service

centre for the region, in the country. Hence, national

operators should enter into partnership with big international

players in the field. The regulatory system should establish

a level playing field for investors and users, and protect the

consumers.

The supply of pipe borne water by the National Water

Supply and Drainage Board expanded further in 2000, when

several new water supply schemes were completed,

increasing the number of connections by 77,574 (29 per

cent) to 582,600 and the total volume of water produced

by 5 per cent to 331 million cubic meters. However, there

still exists a large unmet demand for pipe borne water as

demand increases with population expansion, urbanisation

and expansion of industries and commercial activities. The

central objective of the national policy on water supply is

to ensure access to safe drinking water for all residents by

2010, at present available only to two thirds of the

population. This requires an investment of about Rs.85

billion. Therefore, in order to mobilise adequate financial

resources, measures are necessary to attract long-term

multilateral funds, encourage private sector investment in

the water sector and reduce the proportion of non-revenue

earning water (water unaccounted for) production, which is

presently as high as 35 per cent.

The post office network expanded further in 2000, with

special attention paid to providing new services and

development of services in the plantation sector. The postal

shop concept, to sell other consumer products as well in

post offices, which commenced in 1999 as a pilot project,

appears to have succeeded and could be further expanded

to improve financial viability. Continuing operational losses

of the postal service, competition emerging from new

developments in telecommunications and the well known

inefficiencies in the postal service clearly indicate the need

for early reforms.

Growth in port services slackened in 2000 in the face

of stiff competition from neighbouring ports, which resulted

in decreased vessel traffic arriving at the Port of Colombo

and reduced transshipment activities. The total number of

vessels that arrived at Colombo, Galle and Trincomalee

ports declined by 2 per cent to 4,232 in 2000, while

transshipment handling also dropped at the same rate.

However, container handling at the Colombo Port increased

slightly due to expansion in domestic container handling

with increased external trade. Several port development

projects under the public investment programme were in

progress during 2000 to expand capacity and facilities at

the Colombo, Galle and Trincomalee ports. Meanwhile,

rehabilitation of the Queen Elizabeth Quay (QEQ) by South

Asia Gateway Terminal (Pvt) Ltd. was in progress and two

berths are yet to be completed in 2001. Improvement in

efficiency and quality of port services is not only necessary

to retain existing customers and attract more ships, but also

to reduce delays and costs to producers and exporters.

Education and health sector activities expanded further in 2000, while sectoral reforms continued. The number of government hospitals increased by 20 to 578, mainly due to acquisition of plantation hospitals during the year, while 14 more hospitals were improved under the regional hospitals development programme. New recruitment of doctors and nursing staff further strengthened the public health sector. Private sector involvement in providing health

Tertiary Education in Sri Lanka: Issues, Reforms and Prospects

The promotion of tertiary education to explore new frontiers of knowledge and match labour market requirements is essential in achieving long-term development and social objectives such as economic growth, employment opportunities, higher income and overall improvement of quality of life. The direction and outcome of the tertiary education system in Sri Lanka over the years has not kept pace with the open market economic policies initiated in late 1970s. The antiquated education system, in the context of new needs posed by rapid globalisation, has further eroded the competitiveness of the country's labour force. As such, Sri Lanka's tertiary education system has to be re-oriented to meet the challenges of knowledge based future economic development. Knowledge, skills and talent will be crucial factors for growth in the future, while innovation and willingness to change will be the driving forces. The tertiary education system, therefore, needs to f>e re­structured, incorporating modern quality standards, improving access to modern learning techniques, introducing market oriented study programmes and expanding opportnnities available, in line with labour market requirements.

The tertiary education sector in Sri Lanka consists of university education and technical education and vocational training (TEVT). The university education system, a monopoly of the government, consists of 13 universities inclusive of an open university. A regulatory authority set up by the government, the University Grants & m m M o n (UGC), selects students for entry into each university, and sets academic standards and policy with respect to' university education in me country. Admission to university education is severely competitive. Annually, out of the total number of students (about 183,000) who sit for the G.C.E(A/L) examination, about 50 per cent become eligible to enter, a. university. However, no more than 16 per cent of the students, who become eligible, are admitted. From Year 1 entrants to schools of any age cohort, no more than 2 per cent enter a university 13 years later. The competitiveness has adversely affected the expectations of average students.

The TEVT sector consists of technical colleges and vocational training institutions owned and operated by. the government and fee levying private sector institutions. Training institutions under the purview of the government provide specialised training in sector specific skills, while private sector institutions cater to market needs by fulfilling training requirements in demand driven fields. A considerable number of early school leavers and students, who do not gain admission to universities, seek training in (he TEVT sector.

The existing university education system in Sri Lanka has not been able to provide the country with a work force ready to face the challenges of a dynamic, market oriented economy. The inability to match modern industry skills and trends in economic and industrial development have shut off job and income opportunities for a substantial number of persons. Courses and programmes directed at government employment, which is being downsized at present, have exacerbated the problem. A high unemployment and under employment rate among university graduates points to a mismatch between supply and demand conditions for graduate employment, reflecting a supply driven education system with little relevance to labour market conditions.

A number of reasons can be cited for the deficiencies in the present tertiary education system. With regard to university education, full-time degree courses still remain a highly restricted and centralised public sector monopoly. The transmission of knowledge is mainly by traditional teaching methods and courses. The uniform curricula, syllabi and teaching materials used do not cater to present day industrial requirements while lagging behind international developments in science and technology. Standards demanded by industry are gradually increasing both here and abroad. Moreover, as prices have played a very minor rote in the provision of tertiary public education services, the resort to budgetary financing as a means of funding university education has resulted in restricting opportunities and reducing the quality of the service provided. The intense competition for scarce government resources has led to the under-financing of this sector. The quality of the TEVT education sector is also being questioned with regard to the relevance of the curricula for demand driven courses.

The government has initiated far-reaching reforms in university education with a view to restructuring and developing the existing public sector tertiary education system. On going reforms aimed at improving the quality of teaching and research include curricula reform and staff development. Curriculum reforms include the introduction of course units and modular systems with a view to giving more flexibility in the choice of courses for students, and the introduction of new degree courses which are demand oriented. Moreover, the mode of assessment is also being changed from end year examinations to continuous assessment. Improvements to staff development are being met with the provision of orientation courses in teaching and learning methodologies to probationary lecturers and refresher courses for other teachers. Meanwhile, facilities for career guidance and counseling are being encouraged

19

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

with a view to developing university - industry linkages. Reforms with respect to university financing centre around fund raising activities and revenue generation from non­government sources. Reforms in the area of expansion of university education focus on increasing the number of . universities and expanding intakes.to universities. Meanwhile, universities are also expected to come up with corporate plans indicating the way forward. Reforms in the TEVT sector are also being implemented with a view to improving the quality of courses and the training provided. Private sector participation in TEVT has been emphasised in the reform agenda.

The most recent initiatives announced by the government in its proposed 'Tertiary Education Strategy' give a further impetus to reforming the tertiary education system.1 As part of its unfinished agenda for policy reform, the government is expected to give passage to a new Universities Act. In its broadest terms, the new Universities Act envisions the ultimate goal, of producing a well-informed graduate equipped with problem solving * capabilities required by the changing environment and new skills demands.2 More specifically, the objectives of the proposed new Universities Act revolve around improving; the quality of education, decentralising admissions policy, increasing access to information technology, reducing the reliance on state funding to incorporate other non-^ government sources of financing and further strengthening industry - university linkages by providing incentives for private sector participation in post-secondary education and encouraging industry participation in almost ail aspects o f tertiary education. It is also proposed to develop a master ' plan for university reforms incorporating a shared vision and mission between stakeholders to tertiary education reform i.e., students, faculty, administrators, government and industry. • • 4 \

Budgetary constraints in the future will necessitate • extensive changes to the tertiary education system. New * avenues of financing university education on a cost recovery basis should be sought to replace traditional sources of financing. A key area in this regard would be to harness and encourage the private sector to mobilise resources for development of the tertiary education system. However, opportunities for private sector participation in university education are still minimal. Although there are provisions in the existing Universities Act No. 16 of 1978 to recognise degree courses conducted by private sector institutions, the process involved is tedious and procedures" not clear. So far, only a few private institutions have been given degree awarding status for the conduct of some

1 Advancing Knowledge and Skills for Development and Competitiveness: The Tertiary Education Strategy, Devel­opment Forum - Paris 2000, 2 Presidential Task Force on University Education (1998)

Box 3 (Contd.)

particular-courses. In the circumstances, several private institutions at present conduct courses in collaboration with foreign universities for students to earn degrees from foreign universities. Such private post-secondary education institutions are growing at a rapid pace without any clear policies or incentives from the government. This situation suggests that there is an unfulfilled compelling demand for private sector tertiary educational institutions.

Gains from allowing private sector institutions in tertiary education are many. Internationa] experience with university education suggests that competition among public and private sector universities leads to the development of the entire education system. The quality of education and training will-be improved through competition between private and public institutions. Labor market requirements will be met through a demand driven education system. Opportunities for under privileged groups could be increased with savings generated from private sector participation being used to increase assistance to the most needy students. The government should decide on a maximum number of universities that would be in the public sector and allocate resources to maintain such institutions at an optimum level.-In addition, performance based financial assistance could be obtained from international funding agencies to develop such institutions,

and out of Parliament. Such open debate will help form public opinion on this issue and provide confidence to the general public on the proposed reforms.

At the same time, a regulatory framework should be established to ~ ensure standards, quality and accountability in the new entities and to promote a* competitive environment between government and private sector institutions. The existing public tertiary education system should also be improyed with ongoing and proposed reforms aimed at quality improvements, expanding the availability of opportunities for higher education and ensuring that labour market demands are met by the education system.

care facilities continued to expand. Completion of 3 private

hospital projects in 2000, out of 17 BOI approved hospital

projects, which are in the construction stage, will further

augment private sector health facilities.

The construction sector recorded a 4.8 per cent growth

rate in 2000, the same rate as in 1999, mainly attributed

to the increase in investment on infrastructure development.

The performance of the state sector housing programme

indicated a slowdown in 2000 when compared with the

previous year, while housing construction undertaken by the

private sector expanded. Supported by the demand

stimulated by construction activities, the quarrying sector

grew by 5 per cent, increasing the growth rate of the

Mining and quarrying sector from 4.1 per cent in 1999 to

4.8 per cent in 2000.

1.3 Investment and Savings

The savings-investment gap as a ratio of GDP, which

increased from 1.8 per cent in 1998 to 3.8 per cent in 1999,

widened further to 6.6 per cent in 2000. This was a net

outcome of increased investment by 0.8 per cent of GDP

by the private sector and a decline in national savings by

2.1 per cent of GDP due to increased dissavings by the

government.

Gross domestic capital formation, which grew by 6.4

per cent in real terms in 1999, increased further by 9.5 per

cent (at 1996 prices) in 2000, raising investment as a ratio

of GDP to 28 per cent. Private sector investment, including

public corporations, which accounted for 89 per cent of

total investment, recorded a high growth rate of 11 per cent

(in real terms) compared with 2.5 per cent growth in

government investment in 2000. Both private sector and

public sector major investment projects focussed mainly on

the expansion of infrastructure facilities such as energy,

telecommunications, ports and transport. Net foreign private

direct investment inflows continued to support expansion of

domestic investment.

Developments in savings were mixed in 2000. Private

savings increased, benefitting from high disposable income

and attractive real interest rates. However, public sector

dissavings increased due to fiscal slippages and delays in

adjustment of administered prices to cover the cost of

products in major public corporations. Consequently,

domestic savings as a percentage of GDP, declined from

19.5 per cent in 1999 to 17.3 per cent in 2000. National

savings amounted to 21.4 per cent of GDP in 2000, mainly

due to high inflows of private remittances. A turning around

of public sector dissavings into savings is necessary to

increase overall domestic savings to finance the high

investment required to accelerate economic growth.

1.4 Prices

Despite increased domestic production of many varieties of

food items, the inflation rate, which decelerated in 1998 and

1999, increased in 2000, mainly due to high import prices

and increased administered prices. Both CCPI and GDP

deflator registered higher increases in 2000, than in 1999.

The annual average increase of CCPI rose from 4.7 per cent

in 1999 to 6.2 per cent in 2000, while the 12-month '

increase, on a point-to-point basis, rose to 10.8 per cent by

December 2000, reflecting higher price increases during the

second half of the year. Similarly, the change in the GNP

deflator increased from 4.4 per cent in 1999 to 6.7 per cent

in 2000.

21

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

As monetary expansion was contained at a level

compatible with the increase in nominal income in 1999

and 2000, there was no pressure for significant demand

fuelled inflation. Sharp increases in domestic petroleum

product prices as a response to high international prices,

subsequent upward adjustments in electricity and transport

prices and higher prices of imported food items were the

major contributory factors for the high increase in CCPI.

All domestic petroleum prices were raised in a number of

steps in 2000 in order to adjust domestic prices for high

international prices; diesel by 86 per cent, kerosene by 77

per cent, furnace oil by 100 per cent and liquified

petroleum (LP) gas by 52 per cent. Consequently, bus fares

and electricity tariffs were raised by 15 and 6 per cent,

respectively, to cover high fuel costs.

1.5 Wages

Wages in both public and private sectors were raised in

2000, partly as a response to the increasing inflation rate.

In the public sector, employees earning less than Rs.12, 000

per month received an interim allowance of Rs.600 per

month with effect from August 2000. A non-pensionable

interim allowance of 10 per cent of the salary for all public

officers, subject to a minimum of Rs. 1,000, was granted

with effect from October 2000. The interim allowance of

Rs.600 was incorporated into this 10 per cent increase.

These revisions resulted in nominal wage increases ranging

from about 7.4 per cent to 9.4 per cent and real wage

increases of between 1.0 to 2.8 per cent in the public sector

in 2000.

Nominal wages in the formal private sector were

revised upward in 2000 at different rates for different

employee categories. Consequently, as measured by the

changes in minimum wages for private sector employees

under the Wages Boards, nominal wages rose by 2.3 per

cent, which is lower than the annual average inflation rate

of 6.2 per cent. Real wages under the Wages Boards

deteriorated in 2000 at a rate between 2.7 to 5.7 per cent

for different categories. However, changes in minimum

wages alone may not necessarily represent changes in total

wages accurately, as adjustments are also made in other

allowances. In contrast, in the informal sector, wages

increased in real terms, as nominal wages increased at

higher rates than the inflation rate.

The rising inflation rate, coupled with recent upward

adjustments of prices for certain essential food and non-food

consumer items, could encourage labour unions to press for

wage hikes. However, restraining full accommodation of

price increases, i.e., avoiding allowing their full pass-

through, is crucial to prevent the country entering into a

potential vicious circle of wage-price increases.

1.6 Population, Labour Force and Employment

The mid year population in 2000 is estimated to be 19.36

million showing an increase of 1.7 per cent compared with

a 1.4 per cent increase in 1999. This increase was due to

both natural increase and net migration in 2000. However,

according to the World Development Report 2000, the

average annual population growth in Sri Lanka was well

below that of most countries in the South Asian region due

to the demographic transition, and improvements in other

socio-economic conditions that have taken place in recent

years.

Chart 1.4 Labour Force Participation and Unemployment Rate

Nevertheless, the net addition of between 200,000 to

300,000 persons annually to the population of the country

continues to impose a burden on its limited resources. The

rising share of aged population would further aggravate the

situation. A higher dependency ratio, land fragmentation,

high cost of social overheads such as education, health and

housing, and problems associated with an ageing population,

are some of socio-economic issues associated with the

current structure and trend in population, which need the

attention of policy makers.

According to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey

conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics, the

labour force at the end of the third quarter of 2000 was

estimated at 6.7 million, showing a labour force

participation rate of 49 per cent. The share of employment

in labour force continued to increase, reaching 92 per cent

in 2000 compared with 84 per cent in 1990. The private

sector remained the major contributor to employment

generation as its economic activity grew faster.

Manufacturing, agriculture, trade and hotels, finance,

insurance and real estate and construction were the major

areas of employment generation. According to the Board of

Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI), about 41,000 new

employment opportunities were generated through BOI

approved projects in 2000.

2 2

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

Employment in the public sector increased in 2000 by

about 36,000 (3.2 per cent) mainly due to recruitment of

university graduates and increases in Samurdhi workers,

defence personnel and teachers. Meanwhile, employment in

semi-government institutions increased marginally by about

1 per cent to around 300,000 in 2000. However, the share

of public sector employment in total employment further

decreased to 13.6 per cent in 2000 from 14.4 per cent in

1999. This declining trend in public sector employment is

attributed to faster growth in employment opportunities in

the private sector and on-going restructuring programmes in

public sector institutions.

The unemployment rate, which had declined from 15.9 per cent in 1990 to 8.9 per cent in 1999, further declined to 7.7 per cent in 2000. The female unemployment rate still remains higher than the male unemployment rate, but it is declining at a somewhat faster rate. Unemployment was high among youth with higher education, reflecting the need for educational reforms.

Foreign employment placements secured through

registered sources were around 166,000 in 2000 compared

with around 178,000 in 1999, reflecting a temporary slow

down due to two Ramazan festival periods in 2000. The

Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) has

continued to provide a number of support facilities for

registered migrant workers and their families. The share of

employment placements through licensed agents increased

to 76 per cent in 2000 compared with 68 per cent in 1999.

1.7 Fiscal Policy, Budgetary Operations and Public Debt

In line with the recent fiscal policy strategy aimed at

improving macroeconomic stability, increasing investment

and savings in the economy, promoting employment and

alleviating poverty, the Budget 2000 was designed to further

consolidate the fiscal improvements achieved in the recent

past. Accordingly, it was envisaged that the current account

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

deficit would be turned around to a surplus and the overall

fiscal deficit would be contained by augmenting revenue

and containing expenditure, with a view to reducing

domestic borrowing.

However, the achievement of fiscal targets expected in

the Budget 2000 was made extremely difficult by an

increase in defence expenditure due to the unexpected

escalation of the war, unfavourable conditions in the

international market for the telecommunications industry and

high oil prices in the international market. Consequently,

despite some additional corrective measures being taken, a

marked deterioration in the fiscal situation was witnessed

in 2000. A revenue shortfall, expenditure overruns, lower

capital expenditure, higher deficit, lower privatisation

proceeds, lower foreign financing, high domestic borrowing

and an increase in public debt were recorded. Increased

government demand for domestic financing, together with

the enhanced borrowing requirement by public corporations

affected by high oil prices, exerted pressure on domestic

interest rates. If the resulting high interest rates remain over

a long period, not only would the government interest bill

be increased but private sector investment and business

activities would also be adversely affected. Therefore, the

Budget 2001 was designed to reduce the fiscal deficit and

domestic borrowing significantly, by raising revenue efforts

and containing recurrent expenditure, demonstrating the

government's firm commitment to put back the budgetary

outturn on the medium-term fiscal consolidation path.

The significant fiscal slippages recorded in 2000 were

due to revenue shortfalls, increased defence expenditure,

higher interest payments, a public sector wage increase,

shortfalls in expected foreign financing and delays in the

privatisation process. The overall budget deficit rose to 9.9

per cent of GDP in 2000 from 7.5 per cent in 1999, in

24

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

contrast to a decline of 1.7 percentage points of GDP

achieved in the previous year. This increase was a

combined outcome of declining revenue from 17.7 per cent

of GDP in 1999 to 16.8 per cent in 2000, and an increase

in current expenditure from 18.7 per cent of GDP to 20.2

per cent. Capital expenditure marginally declined to 6.4 per

cent of GDP in 2000 from 6.5 per cent of GDP in the

previous year.

On the revenue side, collections from tax as well as

non-tax sources were lower than expected. Tax revenue

shortfalls were registered in corporate income tax due to

reduced profits in major public enterprises, while import

duty revenue collections were low due to reduced tariff

rates, a shift of the import duty on petroleum products to'

an excise tax and changes in the composition of imports

towards more low tariff items. Non-tax revenue was poor

due to lower profits and dividends obtained from public

enterprises as their profitability deteriorated mainly due to

high oil prices and delays in necessary adjustments in their

product prices.

On the expenditure front, current expenditure overshot

the original budget estimate significantly because of security

related expenditure, increased interest payments resulting

from high interest rates and increased debt stock and a

higher wage bill, following the pay rise to government

employees in August. However, the savings achieved in

non-wage recurrent cost through a 5 per cent cut of non­

essential supplies offset part of these expenditure increases.

The government also attempted to mitigate the fiscal

pressure by slowing down the public investment

programme. Consequently, realised public investment, at 6.4

per cent of GDP, was lower than the original budgetary

estimate of 8.1 per cent of GDP.

The combined outcome of lower revenue mobilisation and higher current expenditure resulted in a current account deficit of 3.4 per cent of GDP compared with the original budgetary target of a surplus of 0.6 per cent of GDP. Higher dis-savings by the government were seen in 2000 than in 1999. The primary deficit (revenue minus expenditure excluding interest payments) worsened by 2.3 percentage points of GDP to 4.2 per cent of GDP, in 2000 compared to 1.9 per cent of GDP in 1999.

Financing of the deficit from foreign grants and loans

in 2000 was only 0.4 per cent of GDP, compared with the

original budgetary estimate of 1.7 per cent of GDP, partly

reflecting delays and slowdown in public investment

activities. Privatisation proceeds realised for deficit

financing were only Rs.401 million compared with an

expected amount of Rs.30,000 million. This shortfall arose

primarily from the non-sale of Sri Lanka Telecom shares

due to depressed prices for the telecommunications sector

in international markets.

The increased budget deficit, together with the

shortfalls in privatisation and foreign financing proceeds,

compelled the government to increase its borrowings from

the domestic market significantly. Consequently, domestic

financing of the deficit increased from 6.8 per cent of GDP

in 1999 to 9.4 per cent in 2000, compared with 3.5 per cent

of GDP in the original budgetary estimates. Given the

limited availability of domestic non-bank resources, a large

part of the increased domestic borrowing was reflected in

bank financing. This included the borrowing of US dollars

100 million as a foreign syndicated bank loan through the

foreign currency banking unit of a domestic bank.

Government borrowings for deficit financing from the

banking sector rose to 4.3 per cent of GDP in 2000, from

2.4 per cent in 1999.

A large part of this domestic market borrowing was

mobilised through Treasury bonds, which is a more market

oriented borrowing instrument. Reflecting the increasing

resort to domestic sources in deficit financing, the share of

domestic debt in total public debt increased to 56 per cent

in 2000 from 52 per cent in 1999. Medium and long-term

debt stock increased at a faster rate in 2000 as Treasury

bonds, the major borrowing instrument, were issued with

maturity periods of over 2 years, lengthening the average

maturity of the public debt. For the first time, the

government issued callable Treasury bonds (i.e., two year

bonds with a call option) as the high interest rates were

considered a temporary phenomenon.

1.8 Exchange Rate and External Sector

International Developments Affecting Sri Lanka

World trade, which started to recover after mid 1999, strengthened further during 2000. World trade volume is estimated to have grown by 12.4 per cent in 2000, up from 5.3 per cent recorded in the previous year. This is attributed mainly to a sharp increase in the volume of exports by both advanced economies and developing countries, with the volume of exports in advanced economies increasing from 5.0 per cent to 11.4 per cent and in developing countries, from 4.1 per cent to 15.7 per cent. While the export volume increased by 9.2 per cent in the US against 2.9 per cent in the previous year, Japan registered a growth of 12.2 per cent, in comparison with 1.9 per cent in 1999. Meanwhile, in EU, growth in exports more than doubled from 4.9 per cent in 1999 to 11.3 per cent in 2000. The major impetus for the growth in imports came from the US with a growth of 13.7 per cent, while Japan and the EU countries also played a catalytic role with growth rates of 7.7 per cent and 10.5 per cent, respectively. The newly industrialised Asian economies continued to maintain their high growth momentum in international trade with exports and imports

2 5

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

growing at 16.4 per cent and 15.2 per cent, respectively.

Terms of trade reflected an improvement of 6.4 per cent

in favour of developing countries, while those in advanced

economies deteriorated by 2.2 per cent. The improvement

in the terms of trade in developing countries reflected

mainly the sharp increase in oil prices. Only a marginal

improvement in export prices of non-fuel primary products

(1.8 per cent) of developing countries was seen in 2000.

Developing countries, as a whole, benefited more from

international trade in 2000 than the advanced economies,

with current accounts of their balance of payments changing

to a surplus for the first time in a decade. However, Sri

Lanka, being an oil importer, experienced a deterioration of

its terms of trade by 6 per cent in 2000.

International exchange markets remained relatively

stable, although some volatility in key currencies was

witnessed during the year. The continued robust economic

performance in the United States strengthened the dollar

against all major currencies during the year. The Japanese

yen, which appreciated by about 9 per cent in 1999 in

response to signs of economic recovery, continued to

depreciate owing to growing economic and financial woes

in the economy. The yen depreciated at a faster rate

towards the end of the year, with an overall depreciation

of 11 per cent against the US dollar in 2000. Meanwhile,

despite several attempts by the European Central Bank

(ECB), with the support of USA and Japan, to intervene

in the exchange market to stabilise the exchange rate, the

euro continued to slide throughout the year, though with

some improvement towards the end of the year, resulting

in a depreciation of 8 per cent against the US dollar.

Meanwhile, exchange markets in East Asia, except in

Indonesia and the Philippines, reflected relative stability.

While the Indonesian rupiah depreciated by 26 per cent

against the US dollar, reflecting the continuing financial

sector problems and political uncertainties, the Philippine

peso depreciated by 20 per cent due to an unsettled political

environment. The Thai bhat depreciated by 14 per cent,

showing a faster depreciation towards the end of the year

while the Korean won weakened by 10 per cent after an

appreciation during the first half of the year. The Singapore

dollar depreciated by 4 per cent in 2000, though it remained

stable during the second half of the year. Meanwhile,

Malaysia continued with its fixed exchange rate policy

during the year. Since the currencies of these competitor

countries depreciated in the market improving their

competitiveness, a similar depreciation was necessary in the

Sri Lankan rupee to maintain competitiveness in the world

market.

Sri Lanka's External Sector Developments

Despite continued strong recovery in exports and continued

of inflows of private remittances, the balance of payments

position deteriorated in 2000 mainly due to increased oil

prices, enhanced defence imports, slowdown in tourist

arrivals, lower utilisation of foreign assistance and net

outflows in foreign portfolio investments from the Colombo

Stock Exchange. Consequently, deficits in the external

current account and the overall balance of payments

increased, reducing external reserves and exerting pressure

on the exchange rate. In order to arrest the situation, several

changes were introduced in the exchange rate regime by

widening the band on several occasions. Similarly, the

monetary policy stance was tightened to reduce pressure on

the exchange rate and external reserves.

In line with the strong recovery in the domestic

economy and the favourable external environment, Sri

Lanka's external trade registered a notable upturn, with both

exports and imports growing at faster rates in 2000. Exports

registered a high growth of 20 per cent in 2000 against a

drop of 4 per cent in 1999, mainly reflecting a sharp

increase in the volume of exports by 18 per cent; the price

index rose by only 2 per cent. The high growth was

generated mainly by the continued expansion in textiles and

garments, tea, machinery, electrical equipment, rubber based

products, gems, diamonds and jewellery. Diversification of

exports continued, reducing the relative share of plantation

agricultural commodities in total exports to 15 per cent in

2000, while raising the share of industrial exports to 78 per

cent. Within industrial exports, textiles and garments

accounted for the largest share of about 70 per cent.

The total import bill increased at an even higher rate

of 22 per cent in 2000, reflecting both increased volumes

and higher international prices. As a result, the trade deficit

widened to 10.8 per cent of GDP in 2000 from 8.7 per cent

in 1999. Imports of intermediate goods recorded the highest

Selected External Sector Indicators

increase, growing by 24 per cent, while consumer goods

and investment goods grew by 12 and 11 per cent,

respectively. The terms of trade deteriorated for the second

consecutive year as import prices rose by 8 per cent, while

export prices rose only by 2 per cent in 2000. The surplus

in the service account declined due to a slowdown in the

tourism sector and a marginal drop in transshipment cargo

handling. The deficit in the interest income widened further,

mainly due to higher interest payments on external debt.

Total net current transfers registered a notable improvement

due to high private transfers amounting to US dollars 974

million in 2000, reducing the pressure on the balance of

payments.

As a result of these developments, the deficit in the

current account widened significantly to US dollars 1,065

million or 6.4 per cent of GDP in 2000. This is an

unsustainable high deficit in the long-run, indicating the

need for strong adjustments to contain it. In the capital account, government's long-term disbursements remained low due to delays in project implementation, which requires due attention. As the increase in net capital and financial flows were not adequate to cover the sharp increase in the current account deficit, the overall deficit in the balance of payments reflected a further deterioration, increasing to US dollars 516 million or 3.1 per cent of GDP.

The total external debt stock of the country declined

by 2.5 per cent in 2000 reflecting slow disbursements of

foreign loans, increased debt repayments and the effect of

cross currency movements. The external debt/GDP ratio

declined from 57.8 per cent in 1999 to 53.5 per cent in

2000, while the external debt service ratio declined from

12.4 per cent to 12.2 per cent, reflecting increased export

earnings improving the debt repayment capacity of the

country.

27

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

Total gross external assets of the country declined by

18 per cent to US dollars 2,126 million at the end of 2000

and were sufficient to finance 3.5 months of imports.

Meanwhile, gross official reserves declined by 36 per cent

to US dollars 1,043 million and were sufficient to finance

1.7 months of imports for 2000.

International foreign exchange markets continued to

remain stable even though the US dollar strengthened

further in 2000. However, despite a relatively low rate of

domestic inflation, the deteriorating balance of payments

continued to exert pressure on the Sri Lanka rupee. The

flexibility in the foreign exchange market was increased by

widening the band in a number of steps. The widening of

the band and regular adjustments for market developments

under the crawling band managed system released the

pressure in the foreign exchange market. As a result, the

rupee depreciated at a faster rate of 12.5 per cent in 2000.

The real effective exchange rate of the rupee against

a 24 currency basket reflected a marginal appreciation of

0.6 per cent in 2000, reflecting maintenance of the

country's external competitiveness.

1.9 Financial Sector

Monetary Policy

Monetary management became challenging in 2000 as

recovery in economic activities required increasing domestic

liquidity but the enhanced public sector domestic

borrowings, pressure on the rupee in the foreign exchange

market and increasing inflation rate, required a tightening

of monetary policy. Accordingly, monetary policy in 2000

focussed on maintaining stability in the money and foreign

exchange markets, while preventing the build up of demand

fuelled inflationary pressure in the economy.

Increased borrowing requirements of the public sector

to finance a larger budget deficit and operational losses of

oil-hit public enterprises, competed with the private sector

for domestic financial resources, pushing up market interest

rates. Meanwhile, the increased deficit in the balance of

payments, which exerted pressure on the official external

reserves and the rupee in the foreign exchange market, had

a considerable influence on monetary management in the

second half of 2000. Consequently, the monetary policy was

tightened, particularly during the second half of the year.

This was achieved by raising the Bank Rate, repurchase rate

and the reverse repurchase rate on several occasions. The

Central Bank utilised a range of indirect monetary policy

instruments to influence interbank interest rates and broad

money growth.

Monetary management was based on a monetary

targeting framework with reserve money being an

intermediate target. The Central Bank continued to rely on

several measures in assessing the monetary conditions,

including growth in monetary aggregates, monetary

conditions index and changes in market interest rates. Open

market operations through changes in repurchase and

reverse repurchase rates continued to be the major policy

instrument.

The monetary policy stance was relaxed at the

beginning of 2000 by reducing the repurchase rate by 25

basis points to 9 per cent in view of the continued

downward trend in inflation, improvement in market

liquidity and strong recovery in economic activities without

inflationary pressure. However, during the second half of

the year, in the context of increasing inflation, increased

pressure on domestic interest rates by enhanced public

sector borrowings and pressure on the foreign exchange

market by deteriorating external sector conditions, monetary

policy was tightened. This was achieved by raising the

repurchase and reverse repurchase rates on several

occasions, to 17 and 20 per cent, respectively, by end 2000,

while the Bank Rate was raised from 16 to 25 per cent in

three steps. However, the Central Bank continued to make

available liquidity to the market through its reverse

repurchase window, preventing a liquidity shortage arising

due to declining international reserves.

The statutory reserve ratio (SRR) in respect of rupee deposit liabilities was maintained at 11 per cent. However, the SRR on foreign currency deposits not placed abroad was removed in August with a view to improving the foreign currency liquidity of the commercial banks and encouraging foreign currency depositors by enabling the banks to pay attractive interest rates.

M o n e y S u p p l y

Despite the sharp increase in bank credit to the public sector,

monetary growth in 2000 remained stable at around 13 per cent

due to reduction in the net foreign assets of the banking system.

The annual growth of consolidated broad money (M_), which

includes the operations of domestic banking units and foreign

currency banking units, declined slightly to 12.9 per cent in

December 2000 from 13.4 per cent in December 1999,

containing potential demand fuelled inflationary pressure in the

economy. The growth in narrow money (M,) moved in a wider

range 4 . 0 - 11.7 per cent, but recorded a relatively low growth

of 9.1 per cent at the end of 2000. Reserve money expanded

by an even lower rate of 4.7 per cent due to a sharp decline in

29

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

the net foreign assets (NFA) of the Central Bank. The money

multiplier rose from 4.26 per cent in 1999 to 4.60 per cent in

2000, reflecting the impact of the removal of the SRR on

foreign currency deposits and the decline in the currency to

deposits ratio. The velocity of money remained at around 2.6

per cent, indicating no significant changes in inflationary

expectations of the public.

The major contributory factor that contained monetary

expansion was the decline in NFA of the banking system.

In 2000, NFA of the banking system declined by 32 per

cent to Rs.69.5 billion, reflecting the significant deficit in

the balance of payments. A large part, about 96 per cent

of this, was in NFA of the Central Bank due to sale of

foreign exchange to commercial banks and settlement of

foreign public debt. The decline in NFA of commercial

banks was marginal (about Rs.1.2 billion).

A sharp increase in credit to the public sector together

with a moderate credit expansion to the private sector

resulted in a 27 per cent expansion in overall domestic

credit. Government borrowing from domestic banks

increased significantly due to the wider deficit and shortfall

in foreign financing and privatisation proceeds. Out of the

increase in net credit to the government, a large part (about

84 per cent) was from the Central Bank. This was reflected

mainly in the increased holdings of government securities

by the Central Bank, as commercial banks used government

securities in their portfolio to obtain liquidity under the

reverse repurchase facility to meet their liquidity needs.

Credit to public corporations rose by Rs.25 billion (193

per cent) in 2000 in comparison to a much lower increase

of Rs.3 billion in 1999. Three major public enterpirses viz.,

CPC, CEB and CWE, accounted for the bulk (97 per cent)

of this credit increase. A sharp increase in international

prices for oil and wheat, inadequate and delayed

adjustments in the corresponding domestic prices and

increased use of thermal power due to lack of rainfall, led

to public corporations increasing their bank borrowings.

. Credit to the private sector increased by Rs.38 billion

or 12 per cent in 2000. The moderate credit demand by the

private sector despite increased economic recovery could be

due to increased retained earnings with the corporate sector

and a move towards new borrowing instruments such as

commercial paper. In addition to the commercial banks,

development banks and finance companies also provided

financial facilities to the private sector. Total credit facilities

provided to the private sector by the financial system as a

whole increased by Rs.47.7 billion or 11.2 per cent in 2000.

Interest Rates

A general rise in the interest structure was observed in

2000, particularly during the second half. This was a result

of increased public sector borrowings, reduction of liquidity

as a consequence of a large balance of payments deficit and

tighter monetary policy. Despite the upward trend in the

inflation rate during the second half, real interest rates

increased due to higher increases in nominal interest rates.

However, larger increases in short-term rates than in

medium and long-term rates flattened the yield curve,

reflecting a market perception that high interest rates were

a short-term phenomenon.

Interbank call market rates exhibited considerable

instability, reflecting sharp changes in repurchase and

reverse repurchase rates and developments in the foreign

exchange market. Following rising interest rates, commercial

banks raised their deposit rates as well as lending rates.

However, slower adjustment in their deposit rates compared

with increases in lending rates, further increased the interest

spread.

Despite the economic recovery and improved corporate

sector performance, share prices and turnover in the

Colombo Stock Market remained depressed in 2000, as

foreign investors were net sellers. The All Share Price Index

declined by 22 per cent, while the market capitalisation

declined by 21 per cent. There were only a few new share

issues in 2000 as most companies postponed issues due to

depressed market conditions.

1.10 Economic Outlook for 2001 and Medium-term Prospects

Global Prospects for 2001

The global economy is expected to slow down somewhat during 2001, after a high growth of 4.8 per cent in 2000. This is mainly due to the effect of high oil prices in 2000, a sharp fall in equity prices in major international markets and the lagged effects of high interest rates that prevailed in 2000, as a result of tighter monetary policies pursued to arrest high inflationary pressures in the major economies. The estimated world output growth of 3.2 per cent for 2001 assumes a smooth adjustment in imbalances in major industrial economies and a drop in international prices of crude oil. Economic growth in advanced economies is expected to decline from 4.1 per cent in 2000 to 1.9 per cent in 2001, while that in developing countries is projected to decline from 5.8 per cent to 5.0 per cent. Growth in the United States, Sri Lanka's major export destination, is expected to drop from 5.0 per cent in 2000 to 1.5 per cent in 2001. The Euro area and the United Kingdom, the other two major destinations for Sri Lanka's exports, are expected to grow moderately, with estimated growth rates of 2.4 per cent and 2.6 per cent, respectively.

World trade, which reflected a sharp recovery in 2000, is expected to remain buoyant with an expansion of 6.7 per cent in 2001. With the expected decline in international prices of crude oil, the terms of trade are expected to move

30

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

in favour of advanced economies with an improvement of

0.5 per cent. However, non-fuel exporting developing

countries would benefit from an improvement in terms of

trade by 0.9 per cent during 2001. The current account

balances of developing countries are expected to deteriorate

to a deficit of US dollars 30 billion as a result of a higher

growth in imports.

With the expected drop in crude oil prices, the rate of

inflation is projected to moderate during the year. Consumer

price inflation in advanced economies is estimated to

decline from 2.3 per cent in 2000 to 2.1 per cent in 2001,

while in developing countries it is expected to decelerate

from 6.1 to 5.7 per cent.

Major industrial economies are expected to relax their

monetary policy by gradually reducing interest rates.

Developing countries, in particular emerging market

economies, would benefit from increased financial flows in

a low interest rate environment. In the global financial

markets, the US dollar may come under pressure against

other major currencies due to increasing signs of a

slowdown in economic activity, the prospect of lower

interest rates, a weaker US stock market and concerns about

the size of the US current account deficit.

With the restoration of market stability, together with

an orderly correction in equity markets in advanced

economies, private foreign capital flows to developing

countries are expected to improve substantially from US

dollars 36 billion to US dollars 116 billion in 2001. Asia

could expect a turnaround in private capital flows with a

net inflow of US dollars 11 billion against a net outflow

of US dollars 22 billion in 2000. The improvement in the

capital and financial flows to developing countries would

help to offset the deterioration in the current account.

The global outlook for 2001, however, faces significant

further downside risks and uncertainties. The world

economic outlook for 2001 depends heavily on a smooth

and orderly adjustment in imbalances in the output growth

pattern in major industrial economies and also in equity and

exchange markets. The threat of a resurgence in crude oil

prices is a major concern for the stability in money and

exchange markets throughout the global economy. Any such

increase would have adverse effects, particularly on

developing countries. The growth projections also depend

heavily on how the US economy behaves during the year.

A hard landing of the US economy, against the projected

moderate slowdown, would have drastic effects on

developing countries, including Sri Lanka, as demand for

their exports could fall significantly.

Sri Lanka's Economic Outlook for 2001

In this background, the present projections made for 2001

indicate a lower growth and somewhat higher inflation, but

greater macroeconomic stability, with improvements in the

balance of payments reducing the current account deficit

and leading to an overall surplus, a reduction in public

sector credit demand and non inflationary monetary

expansion. However, the achievement of the fiscal targets

given in Budget 2001 and implementation of the economic

reforms and adjustments that have been announced would

be crucial in ensuring the realisation of the projected

improvements in macroeconomic stability.

The Sri Lankan economy is projected to grow by around 4.5 per cent in 2001, as compared to 6 per cent in 2000. A slow growth in agriculture due to adverse weather conditions, the moderation of the manufacturing sector growth rate after achieving a high capacity output in 2000, and an associated reduction in the growth rates in trade and other services are expected to be the major causal factors for the lower growth. Tea production is projected to continue its growth momentum in 2001, while rubber production is expected to recover from the decline in 2000. However, the effect of adverse weather on 2000/2001 Maha paddy cultivation and the projected decline in coconut production from its peak in 2000, will moderate overall agricultural growth in 2001.

market access for Sri Lankan garment exports to EU

countries following the recent removal of quota restrictions,

indicate a moderate growth potential in the Sri Lankan

export manufacturing sector in 2001. Meanwhile, the new

surcharge on imports and depreciated exchange rate will

slow down the demand for imports. The slowdown in

growth rates in agriculture, manufacturing and external trade

will result in a moderate growth in other related services.

However, the growth momentum is expected to continue at

a high level in the telecommunications, power and

construction sectors as a result of the envisaged new

investment, while a recovery is projected in tourism.

Inflation is expected to be higher in 2001 due to cost

push factors such as increased import prices and full pass-

through of increases in administered prices in 2000. It is

likely to rise and remain at a high level during the early

months of the year. However, prices are expected to

stabilise in the latter part of the 2001. Accordingly, the

annual average inflation rate is projected to increase from

6.2 per cent in 2000 to about 9.5 per cent in 2001.

Budget 2001, which contains both short-term economic

stabilisation measures and those which are necessary to

correct some of the structural weaknesses in the fiscal area,

has been formulated to return to a medium-term fiscal

adjustment path. The fiscal position is expected to be

consolidated by reducing public dis-saving (i.e., current

expenditure in excess of revenue), containing the overall

fiscal deficit and reducing borrowings from the domestic

market. On the revenue side, new revenue measures, raising

direct and indirect tax rates, and steps to improve tax

administration, have been proposed. A reduction in non­

productive expenditure and the rationalisation of public

spending, while focusing on the acceleration of

infrastructure development, will be the main theme on the

expenditure side. Proposals have also been made to

encourage the remittance of foreign currency earnings and

boost earnings from apparel and software and information

technology related exports. These measures are expected to

reduce the budget deficit by 2.9 percentage points of GDP

from a projected deficit of 11.4 per cent of GDP in a

baseline scenario, without measures as announced in the

budget presentation.

Accordingly, the government's current account deficit

in 2001 is expected to decline to 1.2 per cent of GDP from

a deficit of 3.4 per cent in 2000. This improvement in the

current account, is planned to be achieved by the twin

strategy of raising the revenue/GDP ratio to 18.3 per cent

and reducing the current expenditure/GDP ratio to 19.5 per

cent in 2001. With enhanced public investment at 7.4 per

cent of GDP in comparison to 6.4 per cent in 2000, the

overall budget deficit is expected to be contained at 8.5 per

cent of GDP. After adjusting for envisaged foreign

financing and privatisation proceeds, the domestic financing

is projected to be 4.8 per cent of GDP (Rs.69 billion) in

2001, significantly lower than the realised figure of 9.4 per

cent of GDP (Rs. 118.5 billion) in 2000.

However, the potential downside risks to achieving

some fiscal targets, particularly containing recurrent

expenditure and realisation of privatisation proceeds, cannot

be underestimated. The achievement of the envisaged fiscal

targets is necessary to improve macroeconomic stability and

release more resources for private sector investment, while

reducing pressure on interest rates. As the leeway in the

budgetary outturn for any unexpected change is very

limited, every effort would need to be made to take prompt

corrective measures to adjust for any revenue shortfall or

expenditure increase.

In 2001, a significant turnaround is expected in the

balance of payments with a lower current account deficit

of US dollars 463 million and an overall surplus of US

dollars 140 million. A continuation of the growth

momentum in exports, though at a slower pace than the

high rate in 2000, lower international prices for petroleum

products, reduced expenditure on defence imports, continued

increase in private transfer inflows, net foreign inflows

through portfolio investments, an expected increase in

foreign direct investments, improvement in utilisation of

foreign assistance by the government, expected government

medium-term foreign borrowing of US dollars 200 million

and a projected inflow of US dollars 275 million on

account of privatisation proceeds underpin the achievement

of this surplus. The current account deficit is expected to

decline from 6.4 per cent of GDP in 2000 to 2.9 per cent

in 2001, reducing external sector imbalances significantly.

Total international reserves, as well as the official

international reserves, are expected to improve in 2001,

raising the country's import capacity.

Based on the above mentioned macroeconomic

developments, monetary expansion is targeted to be

contained at around 13 per cent in 2001. The expected

fiscal improvements and a reduction in credit demand by

public corporations will permit the accommodation of

higher credit expansion to the private sector proper (by

about 10 per cent) in 2001 without exerting pressures on

interest rates and contributing to inflation. The expected

improvement in the net foreign assets of the Central Bank

will enhance market liquidity, while enabling the Bank to

reduce a part of its holdings of government paper, which

increased significantly in 2000. New credit requirements of

public corporations are expected to be low in 2001. In fact,

some of them may even be able to repay a part of their

existing bank loans due to improvements in cash flows

following increases in administered prices.

Monetary management will be a challenging task in

2001 under the new exchange rate system introduced in

January 2001. Monetary policy has to remain tight, at least

32

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

during the initial part of 2001, until the fiscal adjustments

take effect, inflationary pressures abate and reserves start

to increase. This is necessary to prevent cost-push inflation

resulting from administered price increases and exchange

rate depreciation turning into a demand fuelled inflation.

Subsequently, with improved rupee liquidity in the market,

reduced public sector borrowing requirements, improved

stability in the financial market and reduced inflationary

pressures in the economy, the Central Bank would be able

to reduce its interest rates (repurchase and reverse

repurchase rates) gradually over the year, without creating

the risks of demand fuelled inflationary pressure.

However, the realisation of the fiscal targets envisaged

in the 2001 Budget and expected improvements in the

financial position of public corporations are necessary

conditions to ensure the achievement of these monetary

targets and the expected reduction in interest rates in 2001.

Any significant deviation in achieving the planned public

sector borrowing reductions would not only make it difficult

to reach these desirable monetary targets and reduction in

interest rates, but could also exert pressure on the exchange

rate. Thus, under the new exchange rate system, fiscal

policy has an important role to play in achieving

macroeconomic stability.

Medium-term Economic Prospects for Sri Lanka

The medium-term growth projections for Sri Lanka can be

considered under two scenarios: one with strong policy

adjustments and accelerated reform implementation and the

other with moderate policy adjustments and a very slow

implementation of reforms. The scenario with strong

adjustments and faster reforms includes continued fiscal

consolidation, public enterprise reforms, civil service

reforms, labour market reforms and a substantial increase

in public expenditure on infrastructure development. The

new exchange rate regime, supported by prudent fiscal and

monetary policy, would encourage the country's exports,

strengthening external sector stability. Medium-term

expectations under the World Economic Outlook projections

by the IMF indicate a reasonable growth for partner country

imports from Sri Lanka, despite the expected slowdown in

the US economy.

Fiscal consolidation efforts outlined by the government

under the medium-term policy framework would lead to

improved macroeconomic stability, reducing pressure on

interest rates and releasing more resources to the private

sector for investment. A declining budget deficit, with lower

interest rates, would reduce the government debt service

burden, thereby ensuring medium-term fiscal sustainability.

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

Frequent price adjustments and continued public

enterprise reforms would reduce the burden on the budget

and demand for credit by public corporations. Low public

sector demand for domestic financial resources, with an

accelerated implementation of structural reforms, would

create an environment conducive to private sector

investment, improve the country's external competitiveness,

expand potential output and enable further reduction of

unemployment and poverty on a sustainable basis.

The moves to expand private sector economic activities

will encourage exports and attract foreign direct investment,

improving the balance of payments position. The planned

fiscal consolidation and achieving a favourable balance of

payments position will facilitate prudent monetary

management and enable the country to achieve a low

inflation regime on a sustainable basis. This will have the

salutary effect of encouraging people to adjust their

inflationary expectations downward.

However, the alternative scenario with moderate

macroeconomic adjustments, consisting of a high fiscal

deficit and delays in economic reforms indicates some

pessimistic medium-term economic prospects. The

continuation of high fiscal deficits with weak economic

reforms would result in a high public debt burden, pressures

on interest rates, lower investment and savings, low growth,

increasing external sector imbalances, high inflation and

unemployment, and an increase in poverty levels. The

continuation of civil conflict with high defence expenditure

under this scenario would cause a further deterioration in

the medium-term economic prospects and may even lead

eventually to an economic crisis.

The two scenarios shown above illustrate the necessity

for improving macroeconomic adjustments, while

accelerating economic reforms without delay.

1.11 Economic Issues and Policies

A little over two decades ago, Sri Lanka, became the first country in the South Asian region to adopt an open market economy policy framework, placing emphasis on an outward looking and liberal economic policy regime, moving away from the inward looking and control oriented economic policies and strategies followed by most developing countries since the second World War. The results of this policy change have been encouraging. Since then, all major political parties in Sri Lanka have come to accept the virtues of market oriented policies, even though they may have differences with regard to the manner, sequencing and the speed of implementing the necessary reforms. This has greatly reduced potential risks arising from changes in direction of the overall economic policy regime.

However, despite positive economic achievements on many fronts, Sri Lanka seems to have found itself overtaken

by other developing countries in Asia who started reforms

much later owing to slower progress in implementing

reforms, due to various internal and external factors.

Consequently, major economic problems such as slow

growth, inadequate savings and investment, persistently high

inflation, unemployment and poverty, and serious

macroeconomic imbalances still continue to jeopardise

progress. In fact, some of these problems have been

aggravated in the recent past, posing greater challenges to

policy makers. These may be due to factors beyond the

country's control, but that should not be an excuse for weak

performance. It should be a challenge to fashion alternative

remedial policies. The time lost in making excuses may

prove costly and the country runs the risk of being

marginalised in a rapidly progressing world outside.

The economic outlook for 2001 and the medium-term

economic prospects discussed earlier, indicate that the situation

could change from bad to worse, unless corrective measures

are taken without further delay and necessary reforms are

implemented consistently and effectively. The need to have a

clear vision, definite objectives, set targets and an outline of

the necessary policy strategies to address comprehensive and

interrelated economic issues on a sustainable basis, cannot be

underestimated. The government has clearly elaborated its

objectives, targets and policy strategy in 'Vision 21' issued in

November 1999. As stated there and in previous policy

documents, the medium-term economic policy objective of the

government is to promote sustainable non-inflationary high

quality economic growth in a market friendly policy

framework, while ensuring long-term external (balance of

payments) viability and providing reasonable protection for

vulnerable groups which would not dampen initiative. As in all

policy statements, Vision 21 and the recent budget speeches

emphasised the need for accelerating the annual economic

growth rate to 7-8 per cent by removing existing bottlenecks

and creating an environment conducive to accelerate domestic

investment and increase savings. There are many areas which

need urgent attention and early action.

Most importantly, the country needs a more peaceful

environment in order to create a helpful business

environment for domestic and foreign investors. This can

only be achieved by resolving the ongoing armed conflict

in a part of the country. As the country cannot afford to

continue this conflict, all persons and political parties

should extend their fullest co-operation to find a lasting

solution by addressing its deep-rooted causes. It appears that

ordinary people who have suffered considerably by the

conflict, are quite willing to live together and work in peace

and amity. The international community has not only

backed the government's peace initiatives, but also

generously offered help to undo the damage. The

governments of countries and the international community

have no sympathy for countries that let internal differences

34

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

lead to armed conflict and break up of countries. It is

natural that they would rather help and invest in countries

that put their house in order. It is therefore, the overriding

and paramount responsibility of Sri Lankan leaders to forge

a consensus to restore peace, law and order in Sri Lanka.

In fact, many current economic problems would, to a large

degree, be resolved with the restoration of peace.

Despite improvements.seen in some years, Sri Lanka's

fiscal deficit has remained high, which has retarded private

investment, raised inflation and increased the debt burden.

The ratio of government debt to GDP is high at 97 per

cent, while the annual interest payment has reached 34 per

cent of government revenue and 32 per cent of current

expenditure. Further delays in arresting the expanding fiscal

deficit would require more painful and difficult adjustments

in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to take strong

corrective measures now to contain the fiscal deficit within

a sustainable medium-term framework, outlined in numerous

government policy statements. As the required fiscal

adjustment is as high as 4-5 per cent of GDP, both revenue

enhancing and expenditure containing measures are required.

On the revenue side, it would be necessary to include

changes in the Goods and Services Tax (GST), in order to

strengthen revenue mobilisation efforts. This tax was

introduced in 1998, replacing the Turnover Tax (TT) with

a view to removing the cascading tax effect and broad-

basing the tax system. While streamlining the system of

taxation is important, any significant reduction in tax

revenue is counterproductive. If GST is to be more revenue

generating, it is essential that the existing exemptions be

pruned further to cover a bare minimum of goods and

services. The contribution of personal income tax to

government revenue is not only low (less thanl per cent

of GDP), but has also declined gradually as a ratio of GDP.

It is necessary to effect further improvements in tax

administration and improve compliance by reducing tax

rates, while expanding the coverage, to increase revenue

generation under the income tax system. Lower tax rates

will encourage tax compliance, while the expansion of the

coverage to public sector employees and the elected

representatives of the people would reftiove the existing

inequalities in the treatment of various groups for income

tax purposes. The present salaries of the public sector may

be well below the threshold specified for income tax, but

the extension of the coverage would result in a requirement

to disclose other taxable incomes, if any, thereby improving

the tax compliance culture in the country and removing the

unequal treatment, about which the private sector has been

agitating for a long period of time. With regard to import

tariffs, the lower average tariff rate (4.5 per cent) compared

with the average effective tariff rate (15 per cent), clearly

indicates further possibility of improving revenue collection

by removing duty waivers and reducing duty exemptions.1

Similarly, the unification of the BOI customs regime with

the Customs Department has to be implemented, while

ensuring an efficient service to enterprises. Further

strengthening of the tax administration system would also

be useful to raise revenue collection.

On the expenditure side, every effort must be made to

contain increasing recurrent expenditure. Controlling the size

of the public service as well as wage increases is necessary

to contain the rising government wage bill. The

unjustifiably large number of families receiving benefits

under the government's social safety programmes,

particularly under the Samurdhi programme, indicates

potential savings by improving targeting and introducing an

effective exit mechanism to eliminate ineligible recipients.

This would not only reduce subsidies to the undeserving but

would also permit an improvement in the assistance to the

most vulnerable groups. Frequent and realistic adjustment

of prices of public enterprises and minimisation of their

operational costs, improving procurement systems, reducing

waste and increasing productivity are necessary to reduce

transfer payments to public enterprises. As the interest cost

on public debt has become the largest expenditure item

under recurrent expenditure, improving cash management by

minimising idle cash balances of government departments

and institutions and minimising government borrowing costs

by prudent public debt management are necessary to contain

the interest bill. The rising cost of borrowing also highlights

the need to bring down the budget deficit to a more

sustainable level of about 3-4 per cent of GDP in the

medium term.

Sri Lanka has moved far ahead of her neighbours in

the area of trade and tariff reforms, by simplifying and

reducing the tariff structure and removing non-tariff barriers.

However, ad hoc changes in tariffs and intervention to

provide short-term relief when temporary problems emerge

have made the policy environment highly unpredictable.

This has discouraged market participants from developing

sustainable long-term solutions to such problems. For

example, the reduction of the tariff on rice imports as a

temporary measure in 1999 to reduce prices not only gave

inconsistent policy signals to farmers, rice millers and stock

holders, but also necessitated further rounds of ineffective

intervention by the government in the paddy market through

the CWE and Co-operative Societies, creating more market

distortions. As the state enterprises are usually compelled

to buy at uneconomic prices, the ultimate result would be

the weakening of their financial position, necessitating

government subsidies to cover losses, the cost of which has

to be borne by the taxpayers. Similarly, changes to tariffs

applicable on edible oil caused significant distortions in the

1 Average tariff rate = Total tariff collectecWalue of total Imports Average effective tariff rate=Total tariff collectedA/alue of tariff applicable imports

35

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

coconut oil industry and resulted in creating an uncertain

environment for coconut growers and traders. Similar

distortions have also been seen in the case of potato

imports. Such sudden policy changes have become a

constraint to efficient functioning of markets, weakening

policy credibility and harming producers as well as

consumers in the long run.

As a majority of people in Sri Lanka still earn their

living from agriculture, there could be a need to protect

their interests, in general. However, this should not be

sought through excessively high import duties or their ad

hoc changes, which would only hide inefficiency and

burden the consumers. The government needs to define

clearly the degree of protection that should be afforded to

the domestic agricultural sector through tariffs. Such a

consistent and predictable policy environment will lead to

efficient resource allocation and encourage producers,

traders, stock holders and manufacturers using domestic

agricultural products as their inputs, to develop long-term

market strategies and encourage more investment in the

sector. This would benefit all parties in a competitive

market environment.

One of the major factors affecting farmers in domestic

agriculture is low productivity. This reduces their

competitiveness in relation to imports by raising their

average costs of production. Various studies have shown

that timely availability of high yielding seed varieties is a

crucial factor affecting agricultural sector productivity. In

this context, the government's recent efforts to move away

from direct involvement in seed producing and distributing

industries and to encourage private sector participation in

producing quality seeds, while supporting research and

development activities to develop new high yielding seed

varieties, is a move in the right direction. It is also essential

to change the price fixing strategies for seed varieties

adopted by public sector institutions, which are based on

non-market criteria, in order to ensure an effective private

sector participation in the agricultural seeds industry. There

is also the long standing problem of sharp seasonal

volatility of farmgate prices, which discourage farmers from

undertaking production and adopting good agricultural

practices. The government should encourage the

development and use of market based instruments such as

private forward sales contracts to resolve such seasonal

price fluctuations, rather than attempting to involve itself

directly in market activities, where its record has not been

a success.

The government has gradually moved away from

setting prices for a large number of goods and services,

allowing market forces to determine them. However, it still

continues to set prices for some goods and services which

are considered essential, and in the production and

distribution of which there is government involvement.

These include petroleum products, electricity, bus and rail

transport services, water services, postal services and wheat

flour. Very often, these government managed enterprises

become impervious and insensitive to market realities, as

evident by heavy overstaffing and lack of professionalism

in management, especially when granted monopoly powers.

When prices require timely adjustment due to increases in

input costs, they are reluctant to adjust prices, in the

expectation of government subsidisation, and run up large

overdrafts with state banks, which add further costs.

Ultimately, they have to be bailed out by the taxpayer. The

weakness of finances discourages necessary investment. It

is important to note that the losses so financed through

subsidies have to be borne by the general public at large,

not by the users of their products or services. The

reluctance of some of these enterprises to adjust prices

appears to be dictated by their failure to provide quality and

adequate services to customers, commensurate with

technological improvements in the rest of the world. The

subsidies to public enterprises have also exerted pressure

on the fiscal deficit, while their heavy bank borrowings

have created pressures on market interest rates. The recent

upward adjustment of prices to better reflect their costs is

salutary, but they need to convince the public of their

efforts to keep their costs to a minimum.

Furthermore, some subsidies have led to inefficient

pricing, resulting in misallocation of resources, with long-

term adverse implications on the country's external

competitiveness. For example, the continuation of the cross-

subsidy on diesel over a long period has led to a

concentration on more heavy engine capacities. Similarly,

a significant cross-subsidy in the electricity tariff structure

and water charges, which places a higher burden on

producers of goods and services, to subsidise domestic

consumption has an adverse impact on Sri Lanka's external

competitiveness. Benefits of such subsidised prices are

available only to the households who have access to these

facilities, while their costs have to be borne indirectly by

the entire population, including those who have no access

to such facilities. Only 58 per cent of households have

access to electricity, while only 30 per cent have water

connections, but both electricity and water are provided to

households at prices, a part of which is paid for by non-

users or other users. The present wheat flour price setting

system provides an untargeted subsidy, which has an

unequal distributional impact in that all flour consumers,

irrespective of their income or wealth, receive a subsidy

from non-consumers. It also imposes a heavy fiscal burden

and distorts relative prices of domestic substitutes such as

rice.

It is important to note that major infrastructure

facilities such as power, transport and water are under less

flexible and often distortionary price setting systems. The

36

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

introduction of a flexible pricing system with automatic

adjustment for changes in market conditions for these

sectors is essential if they are to expand their production

capacity and improve product-quality by reinvesting their

surplus funds and attracting new investors. The introduction

of an automatic and transparent price adjustment mechanism

for imported goods presently under an administered pricing

system, such as petroleum products and wheat flour, will

"allow a faster pass-through of changes in international

prices and minimise price distortions, inefficiencies in

resource allocation and the burden on the budget. Such

automatic price adjustment systems should be simple and

transparent, allowing adjustments both ways in order to

ensure consumer confidence and public acceptance of high

prices when world prices rise and lower prices when they

decline.

It would therefore appear necessary to adjust prices of

these items to reflect their real market costs and introduce

transparent automatic price determination mechanisms as

soon as possible, allowing prices to adjust according to

changing market conditions. Simultaneously, corrective

measures have to be taken to reduce their local cost of

production by minimising system losses, upgrading

procurement methods and improving efficiency. As the

country needs to expand infrastructure facilities adequately,

these price setting reforms and production cost minimisation

measures require priority on the policy agenda in order to

prepare the environment necessary for sustainable economic

growth.

As a highly trade-dependent country, the need for

efficient and adequate port services cannot be overlooked

in Sri Lanka's move to strengthen its external

competitiveness, as well as reduce costs of production in

the domestic manufacturing sector based on imported raw

materials. The efficiency in the Colombo Port has improved

recently with the containers handled per hour rising from

12 to 15, and the average delay in berthing time being

reduced, but its overall efficiency appears to be lower than

comparable international levels. The involvement of the

private sector in providing port services in Colombo will

help in improving efficiency and promoting competition. It

may be necessary to restructure the publicly owned

component of the Colombo Port as an efficient competitor

to the private component, which would be fully functional

soon. Furthermore, changing to a piece-based payment

system for port employees could be helpful in improving

their productivity. As private sector involvement in port

development would take time, public sector investment has

to play a greater role. However, given the resource

limitations, prioritising public investment in the port sector

is necessary to ensure maximum benefits.

An efficient and dynamic public service is required to

improve performance of the public sector and enhance

prospects for private business. Many countries have taken

steps to modernise and streamline their public

administration. Sri Lanka has yet to progress beyond the

policy formulation stage, after an abortive attempt in the

early nineties. It is widely accepted that the public sector

could be made more productive and efficient by closing

down redundant institutions, introducing performance based

promotional and remuneration systems and improving staff

mobility and recruitment procedures. It may be necessary

to make the government pension schemes more sustainable

by moving away from the current pay as you go (PAYG)

defined benefit system to a more affordable defined

contribution system.

The large number of public holidays could be reduced

to levels in other countries by providing a special quota of

short leave to those who wish to engage in religious

observances. It is encouraging to note that the government

has announced the closure of a number of redundant

institutions and its desire to reduce the number of public

holidays. In August 2000, the President appointed a

committee to consider pension reforms. Recommendations

are due in 2001. Similarly, recommendations are expected

from the Salaries Commission to resolve a number of issues

in the public sector salary structure, with a view to

attracting efficient people to the public service. The

government has also established the Public Service

Management Development Authority (PSMDA) to review

the procedures of ministries and departments. The Central

Bank has started a modernisation scheme with a view to

further improving its efficiency, while the restructuring of

the Ministry of Finance has been initiated. The government

has also appointed a number of task forces to make

recommendations for reforms in key sectors such as labour,

telecommunications, apparel, taxation and capital market

development. Moving to a high, sustainable growth path

will require an efficient, productive and skilled workforce

and a flexible labor market. Sri Lanka has nearly 50 labour

laws, some of which are not operational. Some elements of

the present labour regulations are completely out of date,

impeding business expansion and investment, inhibiting job

creation and leading to the creation of short-term jobs, as

evidenced by the large increase in casual and temporary

employment. It appears that the Termination of Employment

Workmen Act (TEWA), which requires government

permission to discontinue labour by the private sector, has

reduced labour market flexibility considerably because the

procedures are time consuming. The application of labour

law privileges to sub-contractors of firms appears to

discourage the growth of the practise of contracting out

parts of business activities. Similarly, the development of

many small trade unions creates unjustifiable and costly

labour disputes. It is encouraging that measures for

expediting procedures for labour dispute settlement and

37

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

arbitration are under consideration. It is also essential that

all three parties (employees, employers and regulators) work

together to create a culture where the labour force works

in partnership with management and owners of institutions

and jointly promote growth and productivity for their

mutual benefit. It is also extremely important to link wage

increases to productivity improvements because

unreasonable wage increases could affect the

competitiveness and the survival of firms in a highly

competitive world. A comprehensive review of the labour

laws would be helpful with a view to promoting new

employment, because current laws seems to discourage new

employment. It is irreconcilable that a country which has

an unemployment rate of over 7 per cent should have laws

which discourage new employment and labour mobility.

Similarly, a flexible and efficient land market is crucial

in strengthening efficiency in land utilisation, particularly

in the agricultural sector. A clear, single legal system, an

efficient land registration service, market based pricing

mechanisms and competitive market structures are more

effective in improving land utilisation efficiency and

productivity than direct non-market and control oriented

rules and regulations such as the recent attempt to acquire

unutilised lands by the state as a punitive measure.

Recent experience has shown that a sound banking system is not only crucial to providing efficient intermediation services in the effort to accelerate economic growth, but also to prevent vulnerability to financial crises. Despite recent improvements, the ratio of non-performing loans to total advances in Sri Lanka still remains high (15 per cent) while the interest spread (i.e., intermediation cost) is relatively high (5-6 per cent) compared with that in most neighboring countries (2-3 per cent). The Central Bank has been continuously strengthening its regulatory and supervisory activities but it should be clearly accepted that no amount of Central Bank supervision would help to make the banking system better and safer, unless the banks themselves operate in a prudent manner. It is heartening to note that some progress has been made in reforming the two state banks. Steps have been taken to strengthen their management and boards of directors. Management teams have already commenced rationalising non-commercial operations and have halted some loss making activities. Further strengthening of the two state banks which account for about 55 per cent of the assets and liabilities of the banking sector, is necessary to reduce intermediation costs and strengthen financial sector stability by increasing their capital base. These banks have twice been assisted by taxpayers to meet their emerging deficits arising largely by directed lending and it may not be fair to call upon the taxpayers to do so again. Hence, alternative methods of capital enhancement such as issuing new shares to employees and customers, has the merit of raising the commitment of the staff to their bank.

In developing necessary financing facilities in the country, a greater focus and emphasis have to be given to the development of local debt and equity markets. The current relatively high transactions costs in the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and declining trend in such costs in other international markets indicate the necessity for cost reduction to encourage market activities. Similarly, there is scope for many more financial instruments to be listed on the Stock Exchange. For instance, listing commercial paper and convertible bonds will boost the activities of the CSE. Moreover, commodity futures (such as for tea and rubber) could be developed, further expanding activities in the market. The domestic debt market has shown some improvements recently, but more remains to be done. Further development of the primary dealer system, introduction of a real time gross settlement system and a scripless trading system for securities, trading facilities for debt instruments and opening of the domestic debt market gradually to foreign investors are some of major areas that may need policy attention.

Efficient and effective regulatory systems are crucial in promoting sound and efficient markets, particularly when financial services and utilities are liberalised. However, an introduction of a regulatory system should not harm the development of the market but should contribute to greater competition and protection of consumers' interest. They should not lapse into being mere price controllers. The general consensus today is that the regulatory body should not be a government organisation, but an organic part of the market with complete independence.

The government has successfully completed a number of privatisation programmes whereby the private sector has been encouraged to participate in government run activities. Results are encouraging, except in a few cases. This has strengthened the support of employees and the general public for such a process. The authorities are already working on 'second generation' reforms, involving large scale public utilities which have traditionally been the preserve of the public sector. Deregulation of these sectors is more complex and needs thorough preparation. The successful completion of reforms in the power, port, telecommunications, transport and water sectors is crucial in developing the efficient infrastructure required for achieving sustainable economic growth.

Business failures resulting from internal and external factors are a common phenomenon in a dynamic market economy. If business failures are beyond the control of a firm and cannot be corrected within a reasonable time frame, a legal framework should be in place to transfer capital locked in these ventures to productive activities. However if the reasons for failure are temporary in nature and can be corrected with the assistance of an outside organisation, such enterprises should be given an opportunity to restructure themselves by removing the legal

Redefining Objectives of the Central Bank

When a new central bank is being established

it is impossible to predict the course of its

development. John Exter, 1949

Introduction

At first there was no clearly defined concept of central

banking. In earlier periods, one bank gradually came to

assume more and more the position of a central bank

due to its involvement in the note issue and acting as a

government's banker and agent. The Riksbank of

Sweden is the first central bank to be established (1897),

but the Bank of England, established in 1694, was the

first bank of issue to assume the position of a central

bank and to develop fundamentals of the art of central

banking.

The Bank of England also came to accept 'the

lender of last resort' position forced on it by the banking

crises in Britain in 1847, 1857 and 1866.1 Financial

panic, a leading cause of crises, could be allayed by the

assurance that Bank of England would meet all

legitimate requirements of finance. Similar crises

occurred in the United States in 1837, 1857,1873, 1884,

1893 and 1907 and led to the establishment of the

Federal Reserve System, consisting of twelve Regional

Reserve Banks, in 1914.

1 Kock, M. H. de, 1973, Central Banking, Fourth Edition (Reprint 1997), Universal Book Stall, New Delhi 2 A currency board is a monetary regime where the domestic currency is linked to a chosen foreign currency. Thus, the domestic money supply could fluctuate only in response to the inflow and outflow of foreign currency to the economy. 3 Exter, John, 1949, Report on the Establishment of a Central Bank for Ceylon, Government of Ceylon, Colombo, Ceylon

impediments to reorganisation. As the existing legal framework in Sri Lanka does not facilitate such speedy closing down or restructuring activities, attention has to be given to develop the legal framework necessary for such activities, rather than attempting to have direct government involvement in restructuring or acquiring failing enterprises.

Most of the structural reforms outlined above are necessary for the rapid development of the economy. However, in view of their sensitivity, building national consensus through open debate and education of all parties involved, is of fundamental importance in implementing these reforms. Further delays in making these reforms are extremely costly to the economy and could jeopardise many of the hard earned gains achieved during the first phase of

Following the example of the Bank of England,

during the course of nineteenth century, many countries

either endowed an existing bank with the sole or

principle right of note issue, or caused a new bank of

issue to be established with special powers and

privileges of a central bank. However, many developing

economies, which were under colonial rule, did not have

central banks in the early years. Instead, currency boards

with limited independence carried out monetary

operations,2

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) was

established on 28 August 1950 as the alternative to the

then existing monetary regime of currency board, based

on the Monetary Law Act authored by John Exter.3 The

currency board system as was established at the time had

several shortcomings such as the inability to increase or

decrease money supply whenever needed, and the rigid

linkage it had to maintain between domestic currency

and foreign currency (the Indian rupee). The Central

Bank was established partly due to the shortcomings of

the currency board system and also due to the symbolic

importance of economic independence that followed the

political independence of 1948. The primary objectives

of CBSL at the time of the establishment were regarded

as domestic price stability; exchange rate stability; the

promotion and maintenance of a high value of

production, employment and real income in Sri Lanka;

and, the encouragement and promotion of full

development of productive resources of Sri Lanka.

Exter (1949) assumed that the establishment of the

Central Bank would greatly strengthen the banking

reforms. It would also cause the country to lag behind its competitors, who are forging ahead with reforms and successfully integrating themselves with the on-going globalisation process. Recognising Sri Lanka's achievements in the past, the international community has often expressed its willingness to support the next generation of economic reforms in Sri Lanka on highly concessional terms. It is vital that the country should not miss this opportunity. Sri Lanka managed to survive many recent crises thanks to the resilience built up by the first phase of reforms initiated 24 years ago. There is no assurance that the future world economic outlook will always be hospitable. Hence, it is imperative that Sri Lanka should intensify its reform efforts to create a stronger and more resilient economy.

system. It should have the power to examine and

supervise banking institutions to avoid bank failures and

should stand ready to advance credit as the lender of

last resort' and thus make the banking system 'almost

invulnerable' in times of crisis. Strengthening the

banking system would encourage the public to make

greater use of markets as depositories for their savings,

thus enabling banks to lend to many. The Bank could

assist in the development of the broadest possible market

for government securities by providing, through judicious

market support, the price stability and liquidity that were

necessary to attract investment funds.

Exter believed that the Central Bank could also do

a great deal to introduce more effective management of

the public debt and more efficient handling of public

finances by acting as the government's fiscal agent,

banker and financial adviser. He emphasised the need for

development finance by advocating that the Central Bank

should have the authority to lend to institutions other

than commercial banks, such as mortgage lending

institutions and the co-operative credit movement, as they

made more credit facilities available to the small farmer,

and also by advocating that the Central Bank should

engage in loan insurance and loan guarantees. He

believed that by helping to direct savings, credit and

foreign resources into new agricultural development and

new industries, a diversification of the economy could

be stimulated, which would make it more resilient and

adaptable to changing economic conditions abroad.

CBSL was regarded as the most trustworthy and

capable agent of the government at the time of

establishment. Thus, many, somewhat non-central

banking functions, were assigned to the Bank, both at

the time of establishment and later on. Among those

were the implementation of exchange control regulations

and the maintenance of the Employees' Provident Fund

(EPF).

Evolution of Central Bank Objectives

The ultimate objective of any central bank is to foster

economic growth by promoting factors of production,

promoting full utilisation of resources, avoiding harmful

effects of business cycles and economic crises, and

minimising the risk premium in a country. In the early

years the US Federal Reserve made loans for productive

4 Fischer, Stanley, 1996. Why Are Central Banks Pursuing Long-Run Price Stability?, Paper Presented at Symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

Box 4 (Contd.)

purposes to support the production of goods and services

under the assumption that providing reserves to the

banking sector to make these loans would not be

inflationary. This theory, which is now discredited, is

known as the 'real bills doctrine'. The inflationary

pressure of the real bills doctrine was augmented during

World War I as interest rates had to be kept low to help

the government finance the War. The Federal Reserve

then decided that the real bills doctrine was inconsistent

with the goal of price stability.

Price stability assumes priority among goals of

central banks. As historical evidence suggests, high

inflation rates are detrimental to economic growth, are

socially disruptive and are associated with political and

social disorder.4 Therefore, inflation should be

eliminated to an extent at which, as Alan Greenspan

states, economic agents do not take account of inflation

in making their decisions. Although there is no

agreement on the extent of inflation targeted by central

banks, research indicates that growth maximising

inflation rates are usually low single digit inflation rates.

Associated with price stability is the stability in the

external value of currency, or stable exchange rates.

There is little evidence that unstable exchange rates

could cause greater damage to economies than high

inflation. Therefore, countries are increasingly

concentrating more on domestic price stability than

exchange rate stability. The choice is further facilitated

by the world experience on the failure of managed

exchange rate regimes. The Bretton Woods system of

fixed exchange rates lasted only from 1944 to 1971. The

system collapsed as efforts of countries to maintain fixed

exchange rates led to instability in domestic economies.

Recently, central banks committed to maintaining both

domestic price stability and exchange rate stability faced

severe financial crises. Examples are the Swedish crisis

in 1992, Mexican crisis in 1994 and East Asian crisis

in 1997. Countries have realised that a central bank

cannot maintain both domestic price stability and

exchange rate stability simultaneously on a sustainable

basis. Furthermore, they have realised that the design of

the central bank or the monetary authority affects the

ability to maintain exchange rate stability. A central

bank committed to maintaining domestic price stability

has to allow considerable volatility in the exchange rate,

and should also avoid direct intervention in the exchange

market to manage the exchange rate.

Monetary regimes that maintain rigid exchange rates

are essentially currency boards. In the process of

4 0

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

maintaining rigid exchange rates, they loose control over

the money supply. At the other extreme, central banks

that have chosen to target inflation explicitly, have

allowed free flotation of their currency, but are in

control of their money supply. In both cases, whenever

internal (or external) balance is achieved, in the

economy, external (or internal) balance is also usually

achieved, leading to the acceptance of both regimes as

sound regimes.

Both domestic price stability and exchange rate

stability rely on a sound financial system, making it a

pre-requisite for achieving primary objectives. Stability

is maintained through financial sector supervision and

regulation, and through the implied guarantee of the

'lender of last resort'. However, financial sector

supervision and regulation are not always conducted by

central banks. In many countries, supervision and

regulation are conducted by a separate institution. Those

with an English influence generally combine monetary

policy and supervision. Countries with more German

influence prefer separation. In part, these different

traditions reflect different historical circumstances. Early

in the century, the German banking system used few

cheques (people preferred cash) and encouraged high

levels of capital. Consequently, bank runs were rare, and

the Bundesbank played little role in bank regulation.

English-style banking systems were more prone to bank

runs. In response, the clearinghouse emerged, an

organisation that cleared cheques, supervised banks, and

at times issued its own currency. Central banks in these

countries were modeled quite explicitly on

clearinghouses and naturally took on the responsibility

of bank rescues, whether as a lender of last resort or

as a coordinator of bank consortia. Although many

English style banks have combined functions, the

supervisory function was separated from the Bank of

England in 1998 believing that separation would lead

to increased independence and flexibility in using

monetary policy tools to hit its explicit inflation target.

Restructuring Objectives of CBSL

Achieving domestic price stability has always remained

the primary objective of CBSL. However, while

focusing on the primary objective, CBSL has been

attempting to achieve the other three objectives of

Box 4 (Contd.)

exchange rate stability; the promotion and maintenance

of high value of production, employment and real

income; and, the encouragement and promotion of full

development of productive resources, Financial sector

stability has not been explicitly stated as an objective,

but has been assigned to CBSL as a taction. Similarly,

managing public debt, exchange control, EPF, issuing

currency and other agency functions have also been

assigned as functions.

The new evidence, and the need to continue CBSL

as a central bank, have bolstered the primary position

of the objective of maintaining domestic price stability.

Achieving exchange rate stability, therefore, is limited

to the extent that it is required for price stability, and

is warranted by price stability. Thus, the exchange rate

may float freely responding to market sentiments.

Similarly, with the refutation of the real bills

doctrine, and its own experience in the eighties, direct

involvement in promoting economic growth and

development has been subdued. A low inflation regime

may promote economic growth and development, as in

many countries.

Financial sector stability emerges as a strong

secondary objective, as stability facilitates the

transmission of monetary policy. Monetary policy tools

are increasingly market oriented. Thus, a sound financial

system is necessary for the propagation of policy. Thus,

until the need for separating the bank supervision

function from CBSL is greatly felt, financial sector

stability will remain an important objective of CBSL.

There is a need for phasing out some tactions of CBSL if the activities involved contradict the operations needed for achieving the primary objective. For example, managing the public debt involves interfering in the interest rate structure and the money supply. Monetary policy is also conducted using interest rate as a policy tool. Thus, the two activities often conflict. Similarly, managing the EPF could yield conflicting activities to monetary policy operations. Thus, there is a need for gradual phasing out of the management of these two activities from CBSL. In the new central bank, other functions could also be carried out as long as the activities involved are not in conflict with the primary objective of price stability.
