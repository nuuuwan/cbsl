Accordingly, the Central Bank widened the margin between its buying and selling rates from 2 per cent to 5 per cent in June 2000 and again to 6 per cent in November and to 8 per cent in December, before widening it to 10 per cent in January 2001. Meanwhile, regular adjustments were made under the crawling band system by taking into account market developments. The widening of margins and regular adjustments based on market developments released the pressure in the foreign exchange market gradually, thus preventing any significant misalignment of the exchange rate with macroeconomic fundamentals, thereby avoiding a potential financial crisis as experienced in a number of developing countries, particularly in East Asia and Latin America.",

However, after 1982, the Bank limited its quotations only to the intervention currency, the US dollar, allowing the commercial banks to determine the cross rates for other currencies based on market conditions. At the beginning, the margin between the buying and selling rates maintained by the Central Bank was Rs. 6.00 per US dollars 100. This was adjusted on several occasions as shown in Table 1 and finally revised to 10 per cent in January 2001, allowing market forces greater scope to determine the exchange rate, with the domestic foreign exchange market gaining a greater degree of maturity. With the liberalisation of the exchange rate under the managed float system, the country also liberalised its payments system and by March 1994, it had removed all restrictions on current external transactions and accepted Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement of the IMF.

GNP, defined as GDP adjusted for net factor income from abroad, grew by 5.8 per cent compared with 3.8 per cent in 1999. This growth rate is noteworthy as it was achieved in the midst of several hostile events, which affected economic activity adversely. The first was the sharp rise in international oil prices which raised the import bill of crude oil and petroleum products by about Rs.30 billion (US dollars 400 million), i.e., 12 per cent of the total import bill or 17 per cent of total export earnings. The second was an increase in defence expenditure of Rs.21.9 billion over the original budgetary estimate for 2000 due to the escalation of the war, from the middle of the year. This expanded defence related imports by about Rs.15 billion (US dollars 200 million). Thirdly, unusually low rainfall in the catchment areas reduced the hydropower generation increasing the dependency on costly thermal generation. Fourthly, the delay in the privatisation process due to depressed international market conditions in the telecommunication industry compelled the government to resort to higher",

Apparently, favorable weather conditions and high price expectations led to increased fertiliser application in 1999, which caused this record output. Predictably, however, the increased supply and a decline in world edible oil prices, together with the capacity limitation of domestic coconut oil and desiccated coconut (DC) industries, caused a steep drop in prices. Almost all DC mills operated at full capacity recording a 32 per cent increase in production, while coconut oil production rose by 27 per cent in 2000. However, export earnings in dollar terms declined by 9 per cent, despite an overall increase in export volume by 31 per cent.",

The antiquated education system, in the context of new needs posed by rapid globalisation, has further eroded the competitiveness of the country's labour force. As such, Sri Lanka's tertiary education system has to be re-oriented to meet the challenges of knowledge based future economic development. Knowledge, skills and talent will be crucial factors for growth in the future, while innovation and willingness to change will be the driving forces.

With regard to university education, full-time degree courses still remain a highly restricted and centralised public sector monopoly. The transmission of knowledge is mainly by traditional teaching methods and courses. The uniform curricula, syllabi and teaching materials used do not cater to present day industrial requirements while lagging behind international developments in science and technology. Standards demanded by industry are gradually increasing both here and abroad. Moreover, as prices have played a very minor rote in the provision of tertiary public education services, the resort to budgetary financing as a means of funding university education has resulted in restricting opportunities and reducing the quality of the service provided. The intense competition for scarce government resources has led to the under-financing of this sector.

World trade volume is estimated to have grown by 12.4 per cent in 2000, up from 5.3 per cent recorded in the previous year. This is attributed mainly to a sharp increase in the volume of exports by both advanced economies and developing countries, with the volume of exports in advanced economies increasing from 5.0 per cent to 11.4 per cent and in developing countries, from 4.1 per cent to 15.7 per cent. While the export volume increased by 9.2 per cent in the US against 2.9 per cent in the previous year, Japan registered a growth of 12.2 per cent, in comparison with 1.9 per cent in 1999. Meanwhile, in EU, growth in exports more than doubled from 4.9 per cent in 1999 to 11.3 per cent in 2000. The major impetus for the growth in imports came from the US with a growth of 13.7 per cent, while Japan and the EU countries also played a catalytic role with growth rates of 7.7 per cent and 10.5 per cent, respectively. The newly industrialised Asian economies continued to maintain their high growth momentum in international trade with exports and imports",

    "text": "The global economy is expected to slow down somewhat during 2001, after a high growth of 4.8 per cent in 2000. This is mainly due to the effect of high oil prices in 2000, a sharp fall in equity prices in major international markets and the lagged effects of high interest rates that prevailed in 2000, as a result of tighter monetary policies pursued to arrest high inflationary pressures in the major economies. The estimated world output growth of 3.2 per cent for 2001 assumes a smooth adjustment in imbalances in major industrial economies and a drop in international prices of crude oil. Economic growth in advanced economies is expected to decline from 4.1 per cent in 2000 to 1.9 per cent in 2001, while that in developing countries is projected to decline from 5.8 per cent to 5.0 per cent. Growth in the United States, Sri Lanka's major export destination, is expected to drop from 5.0 per cent in 2000 to 1.5 per cent in 2001. The Euro area and the United Kingdom, the other two major destinations for Sri Lanka's exports, are expected to grow moderately, with estimated growth rates of 2.4 per cent and 2.6 per cent, respectively.",

Tea production is projected to continue its growth momentum in 2001, while rubber production is expected to recover from the decline in 2000. However, the effect of adverse weather on 2000/2001 Maha paddy cultivation and the projected decline in coconut production from its peak in 2000, will moderate overall agricultural growth in 2001.

The results of this policy change have been encouraging. Since then, all major political parties in Sri Lanka have come to accept the virtues of market oriented policies, even though they may have differences with regard to the manner, sequencing and the speed of implementing the necessary reforms. This has greatly reduced potential risks arising from changes in direction of the overall economic policy regime.",

    "text": "Recent experience has shown that a sound banking system is not only crucial to providing efficient intermediation services in the effort to accelerate economic growth, but also to prevent vulnerability to financial crises. Despite recent improvements, the ratio of non-performing loans to total advances in Sri Lanka still remains high (15 per cent) while the interest spread (i.e., intermediation cost) is relatively high (5-6 per cent) compared with that in most neighboring countries (2-3 per cent). The Central Bank has been continuously strengthening its regulatory and supervisory activities but it should be clearly accepted that no amount of Central Bank supervision would help to make the banking system better and safer, unless the banks themselves operate in a prudent manner. It is heartening to note that some progress has been made in reforming the two state banks. Steps have been taken to strengthen their management and boards of directors. Management teams have already commenced rationalising non-commercial operations and have halted some loss making activities. Further strengthening of the two state banks which account for about 55 per cent of the assets and liabilities of the banking sector, is necessary to reduce intermediation costs and strengthen financial sector stability by increasing their capital base. These banks have twice been assisted by taxpayers to meet their emerging deficits arising largely by directed lending and it may not be fair to call upon the taxpayers to do so again. Hence, alternative methods of capital enhancement such as issuing new shares to employees and customers, has the merit of raising the commitment of the staff to their bank.",

The current relatively high transactions costs in the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and declining trend in such costs in other international markets indicate the necessity for cost reduction to encourage market activities. Similarly, there is scope for many more financial instruments to be listed on the Stock Exchange. For instance, listing commercial paper and convertible bonds will boost the activities of the CSE. Moreover, commodity futures (such as for tea and rubber) could be developed, further expanding activities in the market. The domestic debt market has shown some improvements recently, but more remains to be done. Further development of the primary dealer system, introduction of a real time gross settlement system and a scripless trading system for securities, trading facilities for debt instruments and opening of the domestic debt market gradually to foreign investors are some of major areas that may need policy attention.",
