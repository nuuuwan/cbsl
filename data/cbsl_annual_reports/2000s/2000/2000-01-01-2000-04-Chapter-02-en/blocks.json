Global economic growth, particularly boom conditions in the United States and sound economic expansion in Western Europe, benefited export manufacturing through higher demand. The appreciation of the East Asian currencies with the recovery of these economies and faster depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee helped Sri Lankan exporters improve their international competitiveness. Domestically, steps were taken to improve flexibility in the foreign exchange market. This move led to a significant depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee and thereby enhanced export competitiveness during the year. However, Sri Lankan industrial exports depend largely on garment exports, which contain a high component of imported inputs and potentially face highly competitive",

    "text": ". In agriculture, the main focus of policy in recent years has been on the gradual removal of state intervention with a view to improving efficiency and competitiveness. This policy was effective in plantation agriculture, especially in the tea sector. With the privatisation of the state owned Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs), which commenced in 1995, and the expansion of the privately owned small holding sector, efficiency improved considerably in the tea sector. The average yield of tea per hectare, which was 1,302 kg in 1995, increased to 1,549 kg in 2000 and tea production reached a new record of 306 million kg. Productivity of the tea sector in Sri Lanka had been considerably lower than in competitor countries, and it is apparent that this sector will continue to improve under private management. However, farmers in some domestic agricultural sub-sectors faced greater competition from cheaper imports and some protectionist policies were therefore introduced to ensure a minimum market price for local producers. For example, in the paddy sector, farmers had difficulties in selling their crop due to accumulated stocks, which had been imported under low tariff rates in the previous year. The government intervened by purchasing paddy through the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) and also by imposing a ban on the import of rice from July 2000. Government intervention was also observed in potato cultivation where a guaranteed price was offered and in addition to import duty, a 35 per cent surcharge was imposed from August 2000. These interventions unfortunately gave conflicting signals of the general policy direction. It was argued that domestic agriculture should be protected from low cost foreign production, which was aided by various subsidies.",

This sector contributed 61 per cent of the overall growth, in comparison to 51 per cent in 1999. External trade activities, which were boosted by the improvement in the world economy, were largely responsible for the growth performance of the Services sector in 2000. Investment in infrastructure development also had a positive impact on the growth in the Services sector. The strong growth momentum witnessed in telecommunications in the recent past continued during 2000. Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) implemented a number of major telecommunication projects during the year, with the assistance of donors such as the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) and the Economic Development Cooperation Fund (EDCF) of Korea, with a view to further augmenting its capacity and improving",

Of these investments, the 60 MW barge-mounted power plant acquired by the private sector and a 40 MW second diesel power plant installed by the CEB were notable. Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) implemented several infrastructure development projects with a view to capacity expansion and efficiency improvement. Of the major projects, Phase II of the new North Pier Development Project funded by the SLPA and JBIC and the Queen Elizabeth Quay project owned by South Asia Gateway Terminal (Pvt.) Limited, aimed at the expansion of port capacity. The World Bank funded a port efficiency improvement project. New investments also played a key role in improvements in the transport sector. The purchase of new power sets enhanced both services and revenue of Sri Lanka Railways (SLR), while purchases of new aircraft enabled the expansion of the services of Srilankan Airlines (SLA), despite the drop in tourist arrivals. Increased investments in these critical sectors enhanced productivity in the primary and secondary sectors.",

    "text": "The Telecommunication industry, which gained from deregulation and privatisation in recent years, continued to grow in 2000. This industry, which was a state monopoly prior to 1996, saw a revolutionary change in its structure with the entry of new global market players, such as NNT, Telia, Telstra, GTE Nortel, Huchinson and Malaysia Telecom. The number of subscribers under both Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) and private operators increased significantly during the year. Intense competition improved the services of the SLT such that, during the year, it achieved the target of 'zero fault' in the Colombo Metropolitan area, which covers half the SLT customer base. Although the waiting list for telephones provided by SLT declined in the Metropolitan area, it rose by 5 per cent in the rural sector due to the growing demand for new connections from this sector. SLT is currently implementing a number of major telecommunication projects in order to meet this growing demand. The number of fixed telephone lines provided by the private sector increased by 25 per cent in 2000, while the provision of cellular phones registered a growth of 75 per cent during the year, reflecting a new culture in telecommunication. Heavy investment, aggressive advertising campaigns, introduction of new facilities and competitive prices have contributed to this growth. The number of Internet and e-mail users also recorded a growth",

Of the imported food items, the expenditure on wheat grain, sugar, milk products, dried fish and canned fish increased significantly due to both higher prices and quantity consumed, while expenditure on rice declined considerably (by 90 per cent) due to the ban on importation of rice. The expenditure on motor vehicles and medical and pharmaceutical products rose considerably. The increase on vehicle imports was partly due to continued import tax concessions offered to certain public sector employees. Meanwhile, expenditure on imported non-factor services, which grew marginally in the previous year, increased by 20 per cent.",
