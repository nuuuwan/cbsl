Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

2. NATIONAL INCOME AND EXPENDITURE

2.1 Overall Trends

In 2000, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), in- real terms,

grew by 6.0 per cent. This was well above the previous

year's growth rate of 4.3 per cent as well as the average

growth rate of 5 per cent experienced during the last

decade. The economic recovery began during the second

half of 1999 and continued in 2000 at an accelerated pace.

The Manufacturing and Services sectors performed well

during the year and were the major contributors to the

faster economic growth. GDP at current market prices was

estimated at Rs. 1,256 billion compared with Rs. 1,106

billion in 1999. With a mid year population growth rate of 1.7 per cent, per capita GDP rose to Rs. 64,855 (US dollars

856) in 2000 from Rs. 58,077 (US dollars 825) in 1999.

According to the World Bank classification, Sri Lanka

entered the lower middle income category of countries

whose per capita income falls within the range of US

dollars 795 - 3,125 in the late nineties, and has improved

its position in that category since then. Gross National

Product (GNP), defined as GDP adjusted for net factor

income from abroad, grew by 5.8 per cent. Net factor

income from abroad deteriorated during the year due to a

reduction in receipts from investment income, higher

interest payments on foreign debt and higher outflows of

profits and dividends.

The growth performance observed in 2000 was

attributed largely to the recovery of the global economy

from its recessionary trend. World output expanded by 4.7

per cent in 2000 when compared with 3.4 per cent recorded

in 1999. Consequently, world trade grew by 10 per cent,

as against 5 per cent in 1999, while export growth in

developing countries was 9 per cent. The Sri Lankan

economy, particularly the private sector, responded to these

developments positively. The Manufacturing sector achieved

a high growth, with export oriented industries recording the

highest output growth since 1993. Meanwhile, despite rising

import prices, inflation was contained at a relatively low

level, while enhanced flexibility in the foreign exchange

market improved export competitiveness.

The growth rate is noteworthy since it was achieved

under two hostile events, which affected economic activities

adversely. One was the international oil price hike, which

resulted in the expenditure on import of crude oil and

petroleum products rising to US dollars 901 million from

US dollars 500 million in the previous year. The other was

higher defence expenditure due to the escalation of the war

since the middle of 2000. Both created upward pressure on

the cost of funds, due to their impact on public sector

borrowing requirements from domestic sources. Further, the

decision to increase the administered prices of several

petroleum products on several occasions during the year, in

the context of high import prices for oil, led to further

increases in the cost of production.

However, the intrinsic resilience of the economy, coupled with prudent macro economic policies pursued throughout, was able to arrest the negative impact of these adverse developments and contributed to the high growth rate achieved during the year. The expansion of the economy generated more economic "opportunities, leading to a drop in the unemployment rate from 8.9 per cent in 1999 to 7.7 per cent in 2000. Meanwhile, the overall price inflation, as measured by the GDP deflator, although higher than in 1999, was relatively low at 6.7 per cent, mainly due to the increase in the supply of goods and services and prudent monetary management.

In 2000, the Manufacturing sector grew by 9 per cent. Industrial exports grew by 23 per cent, earned over US dollars 4,200 million, and mitigated, to some extent, the balance of payment difficulties resulting from rising import payments. Global economic growth, particularly boom conditions in the United States and sound economic expansion in Western Europe, benefited export manufacturing through higher demand. The appreciation of the East Asian currencies with the recovery of these economies and faster depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee helped Sri Lankan exporters improve their international competitiveness. Domestically, steps were taken to improve flexibility in the foreign exchange market. This move led to a significant depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee and thereby enhanced export competitiveness during the year. However, Sri Lankan industrial exports depend largely on garment exports, which contain a high component of imported inputs and potentially face highly competitive

42

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

markets. This emphasises the need for a further

diversification of export industries particularly to increase

the share of higher domestic value added industries.

. In agriculture, the main focus of policy in recent years has been on the gradual removal of state intervention with a view to improving efficiency and competitiveness. This policy was effective in plantation agriculture, especially in the tea sector. With the privatisation of the state owned Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs), which commenced in 1995, and the expansion of the privately owned small holding sector, efficiency improved considerably in the tea sector. The average yield of tea per hectare, which was 1,302 kg in 1995, increased to 1,549 kg in 2000 and tea production reached a new record of 306 million kg. Productivity of the tea sector in Sri Lanka had been considerably lower than in competitor countries, and it is apparent that this sector will continue to improve under private management. However, farmers in some domestic agricultural sub-sectors faced greater competition from cheaper imports and some protectionist policies were therefore introduced to ensure a minimum market price for local producers. For example, in the paddy sector, farmers had difficulties in selling their crop due to accumulated stocks, which had been imported under low tariff rates in the previous year. The government intervened by purchasing paddy through the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) and also by imposing a ban on the import of rice from July 2000. Government intervention was also observed in potato cultivation where a guaranteed price was offered and in addition to import duty, a 35 per cent surcharge was imposed from August 2000. These interventions unfortunately gave conflicting signals of the general policy direction. It was argued that domestic agriculture should be protected from low cost foreign production, which was aided by various subsidies.

The largest sectoral contribution to the growth in GDP came from the expansion in Services, which comprise energy, transport, communications, port services, trade and financial services. This sector contributed 61 per cent of the overall growth, in comparison to 51 per cent in 1999. External trade activities, which were boosted by the improvement in the world economy, were largely responsible for the growth performance of the Services sector in 2000. Investment in infrastructure development also had a positive impact on the growth in the Services sector. The strong growth momentum witnessed in telecommunications in the recent past continued during 2000. Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) implemented a number of major telecommunication projects during the year, with the assistance of donors such as the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) and the Economic Development Cooperation Fund (EDCF) of Korea, with a view to further augmenting its capacity and improving

infrastructure. In the energy sector, total installed capacity of electricity was further expanded during 2000 by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the private sector. Of these investments, the 60 MW barge-mounted power plant acquired by the private sector and a 40 MW second diesel power plant installed by the CEB were notable. Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) implemented several infrastructure development projects with a view to capacity expansion and efficiency improvement. Of the major projects, Phase II of the new North Pier Development Project funded by the SLPA and JBIC and the Queen Elizabeth Quay project owned by South Asia Gateway Terminal (Pvt.) Limited, aimed at the expansion of port capacity. The World Bank funded a port efficiency improvement project. New investments also played a key role in improvements in the transport sector. The purchase of new power sets enhanced both services and revenue of Sri Lanka Railways (SLR), while purchases of new aircraft enabled the expansion of the services of Srilankan Airlines (SLA), despite the drop in tourist arrivals. Increased investments in these critical sectors enhanced productivity in the primary and secondary sectors.

In 2000, Gross Domestic Capital Formation (GDCF) is estimated to be Rs 351 billion, an increase of 16 per cent over 1999. The increase in GDCF was largely an outcome of the increased investment in infrastructure development projects. Accordingly, the ratio of investment to GDP is estimated to have increased to 28 per cent in 2000 from 27 per cent in 1999. This development came solely from the private sector where the investment ratio improved from 21 to 22 per cent. Public sector investment declined marginally from 6.7 to 6.6 per cent.

2.2 Sectoral Performance

In 2000, value added in real terms increased in Manufacturing (9 per cent), Services (7 per cent), Construction (5 per cent), Mining and Quarrying (5 per cent), and Agriculture (2 per cent). The overall Services sector contributed 61 per cent of the total growth in GDP. In the Services sector, the highest contribution was from the Wholesale and retail trade sector. The Manufacturing sector, which contributed 17 per cent to overall growth in

1999, increased its share substantially to 26 per cent of overall growth in 2000. The contributions of the other sectors to overall growth were Agriculture (6 per cent), Construction (6 per cent) and Mining and quarrying (1 per cent).

Manufacturing Sector

The Manufacturing sector, which grew by 4.4 per cent in

1999, recorded a significant growth of 9.2 per cent in 2000. The textiles and apparel sector, the largest export oriented sub sector, recorded a 16 per cent growth. In 1999, the corresponding growth rate was 7 per cent. Other export

43

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

oriented industries, which excelled in 2000, were

manufactured rubber products, processed diamonds and

plastic products. Improvements in information technology

and the use of improved technology in the production

processes also contributed to the higher value added in

factory industries. Local manufacturers had greater access

to information on new markets and new fashion trends

through the Internet, which was speedy, informative and

cost effective. Fiscal incentives offered under the Advanced

Technology Programme stimulated manufacturers to invest

in new production technology and to gain in terms of cost

reduction and quality improvements. The progress in overall

economic activities also created a market for industries

catering to the domestic economy. Food, beverages and

tobacco products, which grew by 2.2 per cent in 1999,

expanded by 5 per cent during the year under review. Of

this category, the food and beverages sub categories showed

significant growth. However, the performance of the liquor

and tobacco'sub-categories was poor, following the increase

in taxes on this sector during the year.

The processing industry of tea, rubber and coconut

kernel products grew by 4.2 per cent during the year. This

was basically due to improvements in tea and coconut

production. Meanwhile, small industries also grew by 5.5

per cent. Expansion in the large-scale industries has always

had a positive impact on small industries in the form of

sub-contracting and outsourcing. In the small industry

category, assembly of computers and communication

equipment, light engineering, automobile maintenance and

air conditioning grew at a fast rate. Nevertheless, in the'

latter part of the year, some of the small industries faced

difficulties owing to escalating fuel prices and increases in

interest rates.

Services Sector

The highest contributor to GDP growth in 2000 was the

Wholesale and retail trade sector, the largest sub sector in

the economy in terms of value addition. External trade was

almost entirely responsible for this. The export trade sub

sector, which grew by 6 per cent in the previous year, rose

by 18 per cent in 2000. In this sub-sector, the highest

increase of 23 per cent was accounted for by industrial

exports. Import trade, which suffered a setback in the

previous year, registered a growth of 13 per cent. In this

category, import of consumer goods increased by 20 per

cent in volume terms, while intermediate and investment

goods expanded by 11 per cent and 12 per cent,

respectively. The growth in the domestic trade sub-sector,

which captures the trade of domestically produced goods,

was 2.4 per cent.

Value added in the Transport, storage and

communication sector increased by 7.8 per cent, maintaining

the growth momentum seen in recent years. The

telecommunications sub-sector, which has grown vigorously

and continuously since 1996, provided further impetus to

growth, expanding by 31 per cent over the previous year.

The Telecommunication industry, which gained from deregulation and privatisation in recent years, continued to grow in 2000. This industry, which was a state monopoly prior to 1996, saw a revolutionary change in its structure with the entry of new global market players, such as NNT, Telia, Telstra, GTE Nortel, Huchinson and Malaysia Telecom. The number of subscribers under both Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) and private operators increased significantly during the year. Intense competition improved the services of the SLT such that, during the year, it achieved the target of 'zero fault' in the Colombo Metropolitan area, which covers half the SLT customer base. Although the waiting list for telephones provided by SLT declined in the Metropolitan area, it rose by 5 per cent in the rural sector due to the growing demand for new connections from this sector. SLT is currently implementing a number of major telecommunication projects in order to meet this growing demand. The number of fixed telephone lines provided by the private sector increased by 25 per cent in 2000, while the provision of cellular phones registered a growth of 75 per cent during the year, reflecting a new culture in telecommunication. Heavy investment, aggressive advertising campaigns, introduction of new facilities and competitive prices have contributed to this growth. The number of Internet and e-mail users also recorded a growth

of 59 per cent. It is expected that the growth momentum

in the telecommunication sector will continue, at least in

the near future.

Port services grew marginally, by 0.4 per cent,

continuing the decelerating trend seen since 1998. The

deceleration in 2000 was particularly noticeable against a

backdrop of the expansion in world trade. In 2000,

transshipments handled dropped by 2 per cent because of

comparatively lower productivity and stiff competition from

new rival ports in the region. However, the volume of

domestic cargo handled increased by 8 per cent reflecting

the expansion in external trade activities. Currently, the

SLPA is implementing several projects to enhance

productivity and expand port facilities to meet the emerging

competition from multi port operators such as PSA'Corp.

(Singapore) and the Dubai Port Authority and emerging

hubs in India and the Middle East. The entry of a multi-

operator such as P&O enhances the confidence of shipping

lines and provides an opportunity for the SLPA to

consolidate the Colombo Port's position against growing

competition in the region.

The transport sub sector, which includes passenger and

freight transport, has three different segments, namely,

roads, rail and air. The combined growth rate of these

sectors was 4 per cent in 2000 when compared with 3 per

cent in 1999. The improvements in road haulage were

associated with the growth in domestic production as well

as external trade. The introduction of luxury and semi-

luxury buses for public transport enhanced the value

addition of the passenger transport sector. SLR added 15

new power sets to its rolling stock in 2000. This increased

total revenue from passenger transport of the SLR and in

turn enhanced the value addition in the transport sector.

Following the purchase of new aircraft the number of

passenger kilometers flown by Srilankan Airlines increased

to 6,859 million in 2000 from 5,185 million in 1999.

The Banking, insurance and real estate sector grew by 6.4 per cent in 2000 compared with 4.6 per cent in 1999. The increase in external trade activities improved the profitability of the commercial banking sector, while the withdrawal of the statutory reserve requirement on foreign currency deposits in August 2000 reduced the effective cost of funds of the banks. The insurance sub sector performed well during the year, but leasing activities were adversely affected in the latter half owing to the rise in interest rates.

The Electricity, gas and water sector grew by 4.5

percent in 2000 when compared with the 9.5 per cent

growth in the previous year. The demand for electricity

grew by 9 per cent during the year, mainly due to high

growth in manufacturing and services and rural

electrification schemes. To meet this demand, electricity

generation grew by 10 per cent. Due to the failure of

monsoon rains in the catchment areas, the Ceylon

45

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

Electricity Board (CEB) had to utilise its own and private

sector thermal power plants, as well as hired generators

extensively, in order to maintain an uninterrupted power

supply. Accordingly, 52 per cent of the electricity

requirement was generated thermally, in contrast to 31 per

cent in the previous year. Intermediate input costs in

electricity generation thus increased substantially due to

high costs of thermal generation as world petroleum prices

rose. Accordingly, value added in the electricity sub-sector,

which grew by 8.9 per cent in 1999, decelerated during the

year, with the sector growing at 4.5 per cent. Meanwhile,

the water sub sector, which includes collection, purification

and distribution of pipeborne water, grew by 4.5 per cent

during the year. In 1999, the corresponding growth rate was

13.7 per cent. The bulk distribution of water fell by 8 per

cent between the two periods due to short supply following

the failure of monsoon rains.

The public administration and defence sector grew by

4.2 per cent. Employment in the public sector expanded at

the same rate, notably in provincial administration, defence

personnel, teachers and Samurdhi workers. Meanwhile, the

growth of the Ownership of dwellings sector, which

captures the value added of the service generated by owner

occupied houses, was 1.7 per cent, contributing 1.8 per cent

of total GDP. The 'Other' services sector, which captures

service activities not classified under major service, grew

by 2.3 per cent in 2000 when compared to 9.8 per cent in

1999. The deceleration in this sector is mainly attributed

to the negative growth in the hotel and related services sub

sector due to the decline in tourist arrivals.

Hotel services, which mainly depend on foreign

tourists, registered a decline of 6.1 per cent in 2000. Tourist

arrivals declined by 8 per cent compared with the previous

year to 400,414, but foreign guest nights in graded hotels

rose by 2.2 per cent, indicating that tourists had stayed

longer. Meanwhile, the local tourism industry performed

well as indicated by the local guest nights in graded hotels,

which increased by 15 per cent during the year. The private

health services sub-sector, which is facing increased demand

due to limited medical facilities in government hospitals,

rising incomes of people and a growing urban population,

grew by 10 per cent in 2000.

The rising trend to outsource activities such as security

and janitorial services, created a higher demand and this

sector recorded a growth rate of 10 per cent during 2000.

Computer software development and data related services,

which face growing demand and scope for further

expansion, recorded a healthy growth of 16 per cent.

Construction Sector

The construction of residential and commercial buildings and infrastructure grew by 4.8 per cent in 2000, as in the previous year. This growth was mainly attributed to the

increase in investment on infrastructure development in the

energy, telecommunication and transport sectors. However,

the growth in construction of buildings decelerated over the

previous year. The state sector housing programme, which

is implemented by the National Housing Development

Authority (NHDA) showed a notable decline in terms of

the number of houses commenced and completed, as well

as loans granted for housing construction. Private sector

construction activities appear to have decelerated during the

year, as indicated by the drop in credit facilities provided

by commercial banks to housing and property development

projects.

Mining and Quarrying Sector

The Mining and quarrying sector, which grew of 4.1 per

cent in the previous year, grew by 4.8 per cent in 2000.

Though gem mining declined by 10 per cent, export

earnings from gems recorded an increase of 64 per cent due

to a sharp increase in export prices. The production of

phosphate and graphite increased, while that of mineral

sands such as ilmenite, rutile and crude zircon remained

low. The quarrying sub sector grew by 5 per cent with

continuous expansion in construction activities which

stimulated the demand for major quarrying products such

as sand, metal stones, lime and clay for bricks and roofing

tiles.

Agriculture Sector

The overall Agriculture sector grew at a slower rate of 1.8

per cent, when compared with the 4.5 per cent growth in

1999. This deceleration was basically attributed to the

dismal performance of certain sub-sectors. However, the

plantation sector performed well, with increased production

of two major crops, tea and coconut. Tea production

continued its high growth for the sixth consecutive year,

reaching a new record level, 305.7 million kgs. This is an

increase of 7.8 per cent over 1999. This is largely a result

of increased production of low grown tea, by 11.5 per cent,

which is dominated by small holders. Tea production at the

high and medium elevations mainly under private plantation

companies, recorded an increase of 3.6 per cent. The

increase in overall production was solely due to higher

yields, as total land area remained unchanged during this

period. Improved management practices under the private

sector, increased fertiliser application and favourable

weather conditions contributed to the higher productivity.

Improvement in tea prices during the year made tea

cultivation more lucrative. The average price of tea at the

Colombo auction rose by 17.3 per cent during 2000, to Rs.

136.47 per kg, the highest price ever recorded. Enhanced

demand from Russia and other CIS countries due to

economic recovery in the region, extended demand from the

Middle East following the oil price hike, a crop shortfall

in Kenya and depreciation of the domestic currency

contributed to raise tea prices.

Coconut production is estimated to have increased by

8.8 per cent to 3,055 million nuts in 2000. Favourable

weather conditions that prevailed in 2000, as well as the

lagged effect of the well distributed rainfall which prevailed

during the previous year contributed to this improvement.

Despite the improvements in prices, rubber production

declined by 9.7 per cent from 96.6 million kg in 1999 to

87.2 million kg in 2000. The depressed prices that prevailed

over a considerable period of time have had a negative

impact on replanting and fertiliser application, resulting in

low production.

In domestic agriculture, paddy production in the 1999/

2000 Maha season and 2000 Yala season was estimated at

2,859 thousand metric tons, a marginal decline of 0.3 per

cent over the previous year. In spite of the drop in

production, the producer price of paddy declined by 12 per

cent during the year, because of high stocks accumulated

after a tariff reduction at end 1999, thereby reducing the

profitability of this sector. In the subsidiary food crops

category, the production of potatoes, which has been badly

affected since 1996 due to severe competition from cheap

imports, recorded a growth of 79 per cent. Evidently, the

guaranteed price offered by the CWE, the increase in the

effective import duty rate to 80 per cent, as well as the

government decision to write off 75 per cent of their

outstanding loans, encouraged potato farmers. However,

sharp declines in the production of big onions, green gram

and chillies mitigated the positive impact of the growth in

potatoes and hence, the subsidiary food crops category grew

by only 1 per cent. The decline in the production of big

onions and chillies was due to the depressed prices that

prevailed in the market with cheaper imports. Meanwhile,

production of vegetables improved by 3.4 per cent in 2000.

There was a decline in the production of cloves, arecanuts,

cocoa, coffee and cashew nuts and export earnings from

minor export crops declined by 6 per cent in terms of US

dollars.

The increase in animal husbandry output was marginal

in 2000. In this sub-sector, chicken production grew by 18

per cent owing to increase in demand, growth in the fast

food industry and improved marketing networks. However,

the production of other meats, such as beef and pork,

declined, while that of eggs dropped by 1.5 per cent.

2.3 Expenditure

The aggregate demand generated by domestic economic

activities is measured by Gross Domestic Expenditure

(GDE), which is the sum of consumption and investment

expenditure (Gross Domestic Capital Formation) of the

private and public sectors of the economy.

Consumption expenditure, at current market prices, is

estimated at Rs. 1,038 billion, an increase of 16.6 per cent

over Rs. 890 billion in the previous year. Private

consumption expenditure, which represents almost 90 per

cent of overall consumption expenditure, recorded a growth

of 14.7 per cent from Rs. 790 billion in 1999 to Rs 906

billion in 2000. In 1999, the corresponding growth rate was

9.2 per cent. The higher growth was attributed to the higher

real economic growth in 2000, which in turn increased

disposable income, and comparatively higher growth in

prices in 2000.

Private consumption expenditure on imported goods and non-factor services registered an increase of 21 per cent in 2000, against 10 per cent in 1999. Of the imported items, expenditure on major food items rose by 11 per cent, while that on other food items, and consumer durable goods grew by 23 per cent over the previous year. Of the imported food items, the expenditure on wheat grain, sugar, milk products, dried fish and canned fish increased significantly due to both higher prices and quantity consumed, while expenditure on rice declined considerably (by 90 per cent) due to the ban on importation of rice. The expenditure on motor vehicles and medical and pharmaceutical products rose considerably. The increase on vehicle imports was partly due to continued import tax concessions offered to certain public sector employees. Meanwhile, expenditure on imported non-factor services, which grew marginally in the previous year, increased by 20 per cent.

Reflecting the positive impact of higher economic

growth on disposable income, the expenditure on

domestically produced goods rose by 12 per cent. The

expenditure on food increased by 3 per cent due to the

growth in domestic production for some foods as well as

higher market prices for others. Expenditure on industrial

goods rose by 17 per cent over the previous year. Of this

category, consumption of processed foods, beverages,

clothing and plastic goods recorded a significant increase.

such as telecommunication, transport, utilities and financial

services grew by 12 per cent.

Gross Domestic Capital Formation (GDCF), which

grew by 18 per cent in 1999, is estimated to have increased

by 16 per cent to Rs 351 billion in 2000. Private sector

investment, which comprises 77 per cent of the total

investment, grew at 18 per cent, while the increase in

government investment was 13 per cent. Both private sector

and public sector investment projects focussed on the

expansion of infrastructure facilities such as port services,

telecommunications, aviation, energy, transport and road

construction.

2.4 Availability and Utilisation of Resources

The total resources available to the economy, consisting of

GDP and import of goods and non-factor services (foreign

resources), at current market prices, increased to Rs. 1,880

billion in 2000 from Rs. 1,584 billion in 1999. This

increase of Rs 296 billion was generated by an increase of

Rs 150 billion in GDP at current market prices and Rs. 146

billion increase in foreign resources.

The availability of resources valued at constant (1996)

prices rose by 9 per cent in 2000, as against 5.2 per cent

in the previous year, reflecting a higher real growth and the

higher volume of imports. In 2000, consumption

expenditure grew by 5.2 per cent, while Gross Domestic

Fixed Capital Formation (GDFCF) increased by 9.5 per cent

to Rs. 259 billion. The share of foreign resources had risen

from 33 per cent to 35 per cent. Of the total resources, 57

per cent was utilised on consumption and 18 per cent on

capital formation, while 25 per cent was used as export of

goods and non-factor services.

2.5 Domestic and National Savings

Domestic savings are estimated as a residual, the difference

between investment and external resources (net imports of

goods and non-factor services). Domestic savings in 2000,

at current market prices, were estimated at Rs. 218 billion,

17.3 per cent of GDP, compared to 19.5 per cent in 1999.

The drop in the domestic savings ratio reflected an increase

in government dis-savings from 1 per cent to 3.4 per cent

of GDP, since the private sector savings ratio had grown

marginally from 20.5 per cent in 1999 to 20.7 per cent in

2000.

National savings, the sum of domestic savings, net

foreign private transfers and net factor income from abroad,

rose to Rs. 269 billion mainly due to foreign private

transfers. However, with the decline in the domestic savings

ratio, the national savings ratio (national savings as a

percentage of GDP) dropped to 21.4 per cent in 2000 from

the 23.5 per cent registered in 1999. Net foreign private

transfers, which consists mainly of workers' remittances

from the Middle East, accounted for around 27 per cent of

national savings in 2000.
