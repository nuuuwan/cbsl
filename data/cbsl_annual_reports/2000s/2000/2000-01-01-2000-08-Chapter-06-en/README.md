6. PRICES AND WAGES

6.1 Prices

The year 2000 was a year of concern with respect to price

movements, as it marked a turning point in the falling trend

of price inflation observed since the latter part of 1998. The

favourable environment that prevailed throughout 1999 and

continued until the early part of 2000 began to change, with

increasing pressure on domestic prices, especially during the

second half of the year, mainly due to inimical external

factors such as sharply rising oil prices. Although most

domestic factors were favourable due to increased

production of many varieties of food items, improved

information and distribution systems relating to consumer

items and prudent monetary management, they could not

totally arrest the inflationary pressures arising from the

external factors. Domestically too, there were certain factors

such as wage increases that exerted pressure on prices.

Rising oil prices were the most significant external

factor that affected domestic prices, especially during the

second half of the year. The price of crude oil in the world

market reached its highest level since the Gulf war in 1990.

The world market prices of major food imports too turned

unfavourable. Prices of rice, wheat grain and sugar, which

fell during 1999 and helped dampen the pressure of the

depreciation of the rupee on domestic prices, started to rise

slowly during the first half of 2000 and then accelerated

towards the end of the year. Meanwhile, the rupee

depreciated against the US dollar at a higher rate,

particularly during the second half of 2000, resulting in an

annual depreciation of 10 per cent compared with the

annual depreciation of 6 per cent in 1999, due to increased

pressure arising from the larger deficit in the balance of

payments.

All these developments in the external sector had a direct as well as an indirect Impact on raising domestic prices, especially during the second half of the year. Their pressure on public sector borrowing also started to mount, as the administratively determined prices of wheat flour,

kerosene and diesel were being maintained at subsidised

levels. This situation forced several rounds of upward

revisions of these administered prices during the year.

Upward revisions of Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) prices

too added another dimension to these developments. Rising

prices, especially of diesel, LPG and furnace oil, fuelled

waves of subsequent price revisions in transport services,

electricity tariffs and many non food and food items,

including prepared food. Accordingly, external factors had

multidimensional effects on raising domestic prices.

Most domestic factors contributed favourably to

maintain price stability. Prices of paddy, as well as rice,

fell in 2000 partly as a result of a bumper harvest in 1999.

There was also an increase in imports of rice in response

to a duty reduction from 35 per cent to 10 per cent towards

the latter part of 1999. Despite a drop in production, prices

of big onions and dried chillies fell due to higher imports.

Prices of many other consumer items such as coconuts

and some varieties of vegetables also decreased as

production expanded due to an increase in the area

cultivated and high yields resulting from improved

production methods with hybrid varieties and other inputs.

Favourable weather conditions in production areas too

helped this expansion. The continuation of the dissemination

of price information relating to major wholesale and retail

markets through print and electronic media helped improve

the information and distribution channels, especially of

agricultural produce. The availability of timely information

encouraged retail traders in agricultural produce to get their

supplies directly from producing areas and thereby to avoid

several stages of middlemen transactions. These

developments have led to improved producer prices and

more stable retail prices. However, producers tended to

complain of sharp declines in prices during seasonal gluts

in supply. As government initiated purchases were not fully

effective in ensuring remunerative producer prices, forward

sales contracts were introduced on an experimental basis in

1999 and their growing popularity seems to offer promising

prospects of reducing excessive price fluctuations of certain

agriculture commodities. These factors contributed to

dampen the price increases of many food items. A tight

monetary policy stance, which contained monetary

expansion at 13 per cent in 2000 compared to its growth

of 14 per cent in 1999, also contributed to minimise

pressure stemming from domestic demand on prices.

There were several domestic factors, however, that

contributed to raise domestic prices, independently of the

external factors. Production of fish decelerated due to bad

weather conditions. Rising demand for varieties of large fish

1 1 5

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

from external markets such as Japan reduced the supply of

such varieties to the domestic market to a certain extent.

Fish exports to Japan rose almost three times in 2000. The

combined effect of these factors kept prices of most

varieties of fish higher in 2000 than in 1999.

The combined effects of the changes in external

factors, of subsequent adjustments in the domestic prices of

major consumer items and of the domestic factors, coupled

with macro economic policy measures, led to a change in

the falling trend of inflation after May 2000. The inflation

rate, as measured by the Colombo Consumers' Price Index

(CCPI), the official measure of consumer price inflation,

started rising in June. The inflation rate in June was 3.7

per cent, following the lowest rate of 3.4 per cent in May.

Rising inflation prevailed throughout the remainder of the

year. The annual average inflation rate registered by the

CCPI for the entire year was 6.2 per cent, which compares

with 4.7 per cent in 1999. The main sub categories that

contributed to this higher inflation in 2000 were food, fuel

and light and miscellaneous items. The respective shares of

each sub sector's contribution to the overall price change

during the year were 52 per cent, 21 per cent and 26 per

cent, respectively. The revision of energy prices during the

year in several rounds raised the contribution of the fuel

and light category from only 2 per cent in 1999 to as high

as 21 per cent in 2000.

The alternative measures of consumer price inflation,

the Colombo District Consumer Price Index (CDCPI),

computed by the Central Bank, and the Greater Colombo

Consumers' Price Index (GCPI) computed by the

Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), both of which

have a wider geographical coverage than the CCPI, marked

somewhat different developments in the overall price

movements than what was registered by the CCPI. This

reflected the differences in the relative weights of major

consumer items as well as in price movements in the

markets represented in these indices. In particular, the

average increases in food prices in the Colombo

Municipality (CCPI) were higher than the corresponding

price increases in the Colombo District (GCPI, CDCPI).

The annual average inflation rate of the CDCPI was 3.6 per

cent for 2000, which was the same rate as in 1999. The

inflation rate reflected by the GCPI was somewhat lower

at 3.2 per cent for 2000 compared to the corresponding rate

of 3.8 per cent in 1999. However, all three- indices

registered higher increases in the sub categories of fuel and

light. The annual average increase of this category for 2000

in the CCPI was 19 per cent compared to 2 per cent in

1999; in the CDCPI, the corresponding increase was 16 per

cent in 2000 compared to just 0.6 per cent in 1999; in the

GCPI, it was 15 per cent in 2000 compared to 1.3 per cent

in 1999. The GNP deflator which covers all economic

activities and hence, has the widest coverage among all

alternative measures of price changes, registered an inflation

rate of 6.7 per cent for 2000 compared to 4.4 per cent in

1999.

The Wholesale Price Index (WPI), which measures the

price movements at the primary market level, registered an

increase of 1.7 per cent for 2000 in its twelve month

moving average against a decline of 0.3 per cent in 1999,

mainly reflecting price movements of imported intermediate

goods.

Revisions of Administered Prices

The year 2000 experienced several rounds of upward

revisions of certain prices which are either directly

determined or indirectly influenced by government policy.

Hence, though not accurately, they are referred to as

"administered prices". These increases reflected the

adjustment of the domestic economy to rises in world prices

and the higher depreciation of the Rupee. These increases

in turn fuelled a series of subsequent price increases in the

open market for other goods and services. The commodities

were diesel, furnace oil, kerosene, LPG, electricity, bus

fares, wheat flour, bread, cigarettes and arrack. Diesel prices

were revised four times during the year resulting in a

cumulative increase of 86 per cent. The price increase of

kerosene was 77 per cent after three rounds of increases.

The prices of all categories of furnace oil increased by

around 100 per cent in three rounds. Prices of wheat flour

and bread were reduced in July by 17 per cent and 6 per

cent, respectively, but were raised in November by 13 per

cent each due to rising world prices of wheat grain. The

price of LPG was raised by 52 per cent in three rounds.

The industrial gas price was revised once by 15 per cent.

116

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

Revisions to the electricity tariff and bus fares were

prompted by the revisions of furnace oil and diesel prices.

The average increases of electricity tariff and bus fares were

6 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively. Price increases of

arrack and cigarettes were 8 per cent and 17 per cent,

respectively.

Inflation, excluding items with administered prices was

2000 were relatively higher than in 1999, especially during

the second half of the year. The highest point to point

change in 1999 was 7.7 per cent in April. In 2000, the

highest change was 10.8 per cent in December, with the

second highest at 10.1 per cent in July. These spikes in

2000 were associated with administered price revisions in

that month and in the previous month. The food sub index,

5.7 per cent in 2000, in comparison to the corresponding

rate of 4.9 per cent in 1999. The administered price

increases contributed 1.6 percentage points of the overall

inflation of 6.2 per cent in 2000, whereas the contribution

was only 0.7 percentage points out of 4.7 per cent in 1999.

Thereby, this reflected the slower reaction of public

institutions to cost increases at the early stages.

Colombo Consumers' Price Index (CCPI)

The CCPI recorded an annual average increase of 6.2 per

cent in 2000, somewhat higher than 4.7 per cent recorded

in 1999. The overall index showed a significantly different

pattern in its point to point change in 2000 compared to

1999. The point to point change measures the change in

the index in a particular month compared to the

corresponding month in the previous year. Its increases in

which has the highest weight of 62 per cent in the overall

consumer basket, registered an annual average increase of

5 per cent in 2000. Although the prices of certain food

items increased sharply, they were partially offset by the

decreases in the average prices of domestically produced

food items. The contribution of the food category to the

overall price increase was lower than in 1999, as the fuel

and light sub index had a significantly larger contribution

of 21 per cent in 2000 compared to only 2 per cent in

1999. The annual average increase of the fuel and light sub

index was as high as 19 per cent compared to an increase

of only 2 per cent in the previous year. Considering that

the weight of the fuel and light category in the overall

basket is only 4 per cent, its contribution of 21 per cent

to the overall price change highlights the significant price

increases within this category during the year. The

1 1 7

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

miscellaneous sub index, which includes items such as

transport, cigarettes and liquor that were subject to price

revisions during the reference period, contributed to 26 per

cent of the overall price increase. The contribution of the

clothing sub index, which has a weight of 9 per cent, was

marginal at 1 per cent. Stiff competition in the clothing

trade in a more liberalised environment has kept price

increases of clothing to a very low level in the past as well.

increases of 15 and 20 per cent, respectively, while prices

in the housing sub category remained unchanged.

Greater Colombo Consumers' Price Index (GCPI)

The GCPI, which has a wider geographical coverage than

the CCPI, registered an annual average inflation rate of 3.2

per cent in 2000, which is lower, compared to 4 per cent

in 1999. The prices in the food and drink category

increased at a lower rate of 1 per cent compared to 3 per

cent in 1999. This sub index contributed significantly to the

slowing down of the overall index in 2000.

Prices of the sub category for liquor, tobacco, betel and

arecanuts increased at a lower rate of 13 per cent in 2000

compared to 18 per cent in the previous year. The sub

categories of clothing and footwear and personal care

decelerated during the year. However, the sub categories of

fuel and light, and transport and communication registered

attributed mainly to lower price increases recorded in the

sub-index of food, which has the highest weight of 59 per

cent in the overall index. The annual average increase in

the food sub index was 2 per cent, slightly lower than in

the previous year. The contribution to the increase in the

overall index from the food category was 28 per cent in

2000 compared to 40 per cent in 1999. The other sub-

indices where price increases slowed down in 2000 were

housing (from 4 per cent to 3 per cent) and liquor, tobacco,

betel and arecanuts (from 22 per cent to 12 per cent). Prices

in the miscellaneous category decreased by 1 per cent

compared to the increase of 7 per cent in 1999, mainly due

to price decreases of soap and coconut oil. In contrast to

the above decelerations, the sub indices of fuel and light

and transport registered accelerated price increases. The fuel

and light sub index, with a share of around 5 per cent,

transport equipment, chemicals and metal registered lower

increases of 4 per cent, 3 per cent and 2 per cent,

respectively. Meanwhile, the sub indices for food,

machinery and textiles and foot wear registered decreases

of 2 per cent, 1.7 per cent and 0.3 per cent, respectively.

According to the sectoral classification, prices in the

domestic group rose at about the same rate as in the

previous year. The import group prices rose significantly by

12 per cent when compared to a marginal drop of 0.1 per

cent in last year. In contrast, the export category registered

a price decrease of 5 per cent in 2000, reflecting mainly

the decline in coconut prices, following a decrease of 4 per

cent in 1999 mainly due to tea prices.

In the end use classification, prices of investment

goods registered a marginal increase of 0.6 per cent in

2000. Intermediate goods registered a price increase of 12

per cent, while prices of consumer goods declined by 1 per

cent, consistent with the decline in the food sub-index.

District-wise Inflation Rates

Since 1999, the Central Bank has attempted to measure

regional changes in consumer prices using three regional

price indices, namely, the Consumer Prices Indices of the

Anuradhapura, Matale and Matara Districts. These indices

are still at an experimental stage, and their movements need

to be interpreted with caution. All these indices registered

annual inflation rates lower than those indicated by the

Colombo based indices. With improvements in information

and distribution channels, a trend has emerged where

retailers obtain supplies directly from producers, especially

of vegetable products, thereby avoiding the middlemen and

minimising transport and handling costs. This has resulted

in lower prices in certain marketing centres close to

producing areas than in Colombo for some vegetable items.

This could be one reason for the regional price indices to

record lower rates of inflation, as they have higher weights

for food than the Colombo based indices. However, these

indices need further improvement in the area of price

collection, for conclusive interpretations.

Regional Price Variations

Price variations among different regional centres followed

the general pattern of the past. Improvements j n the

distribution channels for agricultural produce with the

developments in information and transport facilities helped

reduce price variations to a certain extent. However,

regional markets continued to show price differences that

reflected differences in supply and quality of produce

between producing and non-producing areas. This suggests

that further improvements in packaging, transport and

storage facilities would be required to reduce these

variations further. The proposed regional trade centres

similar to the Dambulla Economic Centre would address

this issue.

6.2 Wages

Employment, and consequently wages, in the Sri Lankan

economy fall into two main categories, namely, the public

sector and the private sector. The private sector is further

disaggregated into two sub sectors, namely, the formal and

the informal sectors. The public sector comprises employees

in the central government, local government, provincial

councils and semi-government institutions. The formal

who do not have such retirement benefits, except on a

voluntary basis and even now on a limited scale.

Public sector employees enjoyed an increase in their

nominal wages during 2000. The rate of increase, however,

differed across different employee categories, ranging from

7.4 per cent to 9.4 per cent. Given the consumer price

inflation of 6.2 per cent, it appears that real wages in this

sector rose by 1 to 3 per cent. Nominal minimum wages

in the formal private sector too were revised upward in

2000 at different rates for different categories. As measured

by the movement in minimum wages, an overall increase

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

of 2 per cent was recorded for the entire sector, which,

however, is lower than the annual average inflation. A

general increase in nominal wages was experienced by the

workers in the sub categories of agriculture and industry

and commerce. However, the Service sector minimum

wages remained unchanged during the year. In contrast, in

the informal private sector, wages increased in real terms

due to the nominal wages increasing at higher rates than

inflation. These increases were observed in all areas,

namely, paddy and coconut cultivation, rubber tapping, tea

plucking and building construction for which data are

available.

Public Sector

The public sector wage movements are monitored by the

movements of the wage rate indices constructed for three

categories of central government employees including

school teachers. An additional allowance was granted to

public sector employees from the annual budget allocation

for 2000 until a salary revision took place. This effected a

real wage increase of 1.9 per cent to the central government

employees (excluding government school teachers for whom

the real wage increase was 1 per cent) during the year. An

interim allowance of Rs. 600 was granted to public officers

drawing a monthly salary of Rs. 12,000 and below with

effect from 01 August 2000. A non-pensionable interim

allowance of 10 per cent of the salary was granted to all

public officers, subject to a minimum of Rs. 1,000 per

month, with effect from 01 October 2000. The payment of

Rs. 600 mentioned above was incorporated in the allowance

of 10 per cent.

Formal Private Sector

Wage movements in the formal private sector are monitored

by the Minimum Wage Rate Indices in trades coming under

Wages Boards. Wages Boards exist for different economic

activities, such as agriculture, industry and commerce and

services, which comprise this sector. There are 34 active

Wages Boards at present. The nominal minimum wages

pertaining to the agriculture and industry and commerce

categories were revised upwards at different rates in 2000.

The corresponding rates of increase of the indices were 2.4

per cent and 3.4 per cent, respectively. However, the service

sector minimum wages were not revised. Consequently, the

composite index for the overall sector increased by 2.3 per

cent. However, the real wage rate index (the nominal wage

rate index deflated by the Colombo Consumers' Price

Index) declined by 3.6 per cent compared to the previous

year, as the annual average inflation rate was higher than

the nominal increase. All categories in this sector exhibited

this general feature of a deterioration in the real value. As

nominal wages of the service sector remained unchanged

during the year, the deterioration in the real wages in this

sector was greater than in the other sub sectors.

Minimum wages do not reflect the overall wage

developments in the overall formal private sector. Certain

employment categories, especially at the skilled,

professional and managerial levels, enjoy compensation for

any erosion of real wages due to inflation. They are also

rewarded for productivity improvements. Hence, these

categories may have enjoyed increases in real wages, if not

stable real wages, although minimum wages in this sector

have suffered deterioration in real terms during the

reference period.

Informal Private Sector

Information on the daily wages of the informal sector of

the economy is collected through a country wide data

collection system. According to this information, the daily

wages in informal sector economic activities increased at

different rates during the year, with real wage increases

being registered in most of the categories. The respective

ranges of nominal wage increases were 11 to 21 per cent

in rubber cultivation, 8 to 13 per cent in paddy cultivation,

7 to 19 per cent in tea cultivation, 7 to 15 per cent in

coconut cultivation and 7 to 11 per cent in building

construction. All these employment categories registered

increases in real wages during the year.

As mentioned at the outset, the recent wage increases

exerted pressure on prices. Although some formal private

sector institutions link their wage adjustments and other

remuneration to productivity gains, public sector institutions

do not. This situation could fuel a price-wage spiral. Thus,

wage increases in any sector will be counter productive in

the long term, unless such increases are eventually linked

to higher productivity.
