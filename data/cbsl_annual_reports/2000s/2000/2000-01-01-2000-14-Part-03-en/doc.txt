The Manager, Bank of Ceylon, Metropolitan Branch, Colombo 1.

Dear Sir,

ADB LOAN NO. 1535 SRI (SF)

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PERSONNEL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

PROCEDURE FOR IMPORTS

The Asian Development Bank (hereinafter referred to as ADB) has agreed to lend to the Government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, an amount equivalent to SDR 14,721,000 (Fourteen Million Seven Hundred and Twenty One Thousand only) for a Science and Technology Personnel Development Project which will be executed by the Ministry of Science and Technology (hereinafter referred to as MST) who will utilize a part of the credit for the importation of equipment for the project. You are required to observe the following procedure in dealing with imports under this project.

2. All imports which must be from eligible source countries as shown in Annexure I, should be made against confirmed, irrevocable, without recourse Letters of Credit established by your bank on application made by MST. Every such Letter of Credit should contain the following clause:

"This Letter of Credit is established under Asian Development Bank Loan No. 1535 SRI(SF) and becomes effective only if and when Asian Development Bank issues its commitment letter to the advising/confirming bank. For payment, please follow the instructions contained in the said commitment letter".

Even if the above mentioned clause is not incorporated in the Letter of Credit, it will immediately become operative on the strength of your bank's commitment to finance the transaction. However, the ADB's commitment if and when issued, will shift the financing commitment to the ADB. In such case, the Letter of Credit should contain the following clause :

"The financing of this Letter of Credit is undertaken by Bank of Ceylon, Metropolitan Branch, Colombo, Sri Lanka. However, it is established under Asian Development Bank Loan No. 1535 SRI(SF), and if and when Asian Development Bank issues the commitment letter to the advising/confirming bank, the latter shall follow the instructions contained in the said commitment letter, and claim payment/ reimbursement from Asian Development Bank".

Two copies of your Letter of Credit should be sent to MST who will arrange to have the ADB issue its formal letter of commitment to your bank's correspondent. If the ADB agrees to the MST's request it will issue a formal commitment letter to the designated commercial bank in the form shown in Annexure 2 to this letter.

3. (/) ADB's written approval is required for any amendments to the Letter of Credit involving :

(a) terms of payment including currency & amount of the Letter of Credit;

(b) the description or quantity of goods;

(c) the beneficiary;

(d) the country of origin; and

ii

(e) extension of the expiry date of the Letter of Credit beyond the closing date i.e. 31st

December, 2002 for withdrawal from the Loan Account.

Amendments not covered under (a) to (e) above do not require A D B ' s approval. Requests

for approval of amendments mentioned above should be made promptly by the MST on the

form shown in Annexure 3 to this letter accompanied by one copy of the amendment signed

by you. The amendment of a Letter of Credit in such cases should include the following

provision:-

"This amendment shall become effective when it is approved by A D B "

The A D B ' s approval, if given, will be communicated to your bank's correspondent as well

as to the MST on the form shown in Annexure 4 to this letter.

(ii) The expiry date and the shipping date may be extended up to the closing date for withdrawal

from the Loan Account without A D B ' s prior approval. When such extension has been made,

MST should promptly inform A D B of such extension in the form shown in Annexure 3 to

this letter attaching one copy of the extension duly signed by an authorized officer of your

bank. T w o copies of every amendment, whether subject to A D B ' s prior approval or not,

should be sent by your bank to MST who will arrange, where necessary, for the A D B ' s

approval to be issued.

4. On making payment to the beneficiary in terms of a Letter of Credit in respect of which a letter of

commitment has been issued by the A D B , your bank's correspondent should forward the relevant documents

to your bank and request reimbursement from A D B in the form shown in Annexure 5 of this letter. Your

bank's correspondent should also forward a copy of the request for reimbursement to MST. In order to

facilitate prompt disbursement, your bank's correspondent may send an authenticated SWIFT, telex or cable

request to the A D B in the form shown in Annexure 6 to this letter. Arrangements should be made with the

correspondent to advise your bank as expeditiously as possible about the receipt of reimbursement from

A D B , and the shipping documents should be retained until confirmation of such reimbursement has been

received. N o Counterpart Funds are to be collected from the MST at the time of releasing the documents.

5. In case there is any discrepancy between the shipping documents and the terms of a Letter of

Credit, the A D B will not be in a position to honour the payment claim. Neither will it be in a position to

accept a Letter of Indemnity issued or endorsed by (Negotiating) commercial bank. In such an event, the

negotiating commercial bank should seek through your bank the MST's authorization to make such payment

despite any discrepancy.

The MST after authorizing the payment in consultation with your bank, should inform A D B by cable of

the discrepancy and of the payment authorization given to the negotiating bank.

6. Where a commitment is issued by A D B in a currency other than the US Dollar, the commitment

letter will specify the U S Dollar equivalent determined on the basis of the exchange rate at which the ADB

expects the non-US currency to become available for payment under such commitment. If in the case of any

particular claim made by any of your bank's correspondents in a non-US Currency, the US Dollar equivalent

exceeds the amount available under A D B ' s commitment, A D B will limit the reimbursement to the non-US

Currency equivalent of such US Dollar amount available. If for this reason or for any other reason

whatsoever, A D B declines to reimburse your bank's correspondent in full or in part in respect of a claim

made in terms of your Letter of Credit, your bank may remit to your bank's correspondent the amount

disallowed by the A D B . You should make necessary arrangements for this purpose with MST.

7. The Controller of Exchange will advise your bank regarding Exchange Control requirements in this connection.

8. All your bank's charges should be for account of MST.

Dear Sir,

IDA CR. NO. 14 CE - ENVIRONMENT ACTION 1 PROJECT

The following procedure should be observed in respect of imports under the captioned loan granted to

Sri Lanka by the International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank.

1. Imports shall be against confirmed irrevocable without recourse Letters of Credit established by your bank on behalf of Project Director, Environment Action 1 Project, Ministry of Forestry and. Environment, No. 104 A, Kitulwatta Road, Colombo 8.

2. Your bank's authority for opening Letters of Credit will be the letters of allocation issued by the

Director General of External Resources under the title "IDA Cr. 14 CE - Environment Action 1 Project".

3. Every Letter of Credit opened by your bank, unless otherwise advised by me, should provide that

the negotiating bank will be reimbursed by IDA and that the Letter of Credit will become operative only

when IDA issues its special commitment in favour of the negotiating bank.

4. Applications for Special Commitment to IDA should be made by your customer on Form 1931

(extract attached) supported by the following documents:

(a) a copy of the contract or purchase order related to the payment to be made; and

(b) two copies of the Letter of Credit your bank proposes to issue.

5. The negotiating bank should be advised to furnish copies of all amendments made to each Letter of

Credit to IDA which will provide its written approval for amendments involving:

(a) the value of the Letter of Credit;

(b) the description or quantity of goods ;

(c) the beneficiary; and

(d) any extension of the expiry date of the Letter of Credit more than six months beyond the

original date or beyond the date quoted in the special commitment issued by IDA.

N o other amendments require IDA's prior approval.

6. Since the captioned line of credit is denominated in Special Drawing Rights (SDR), the IDA will

specify the SDR commitment in its special commitment letters to the negotiating bank in respect of Letters of

Credit expressed in another currency. If due to this limitation of its commitment, IDA does not reimburse the

full amount of the foreign currency to your correspondent bank abroad as specified in the Letter of Credit,

you may remit the balance due to the negotiating bank in accordance with the instructions issued to you in

this regard by the Controller of Exchange.

7. Importers under this credit are not required to pay the Sri Lanka rupee value of the shipping

documents involved to the Government's Counterpart Fund Account. You may therefore release such

xv

documents to your customers no sooner they are received by your bank after recovering commissions, charges etc., if any, due to your bank or to the negotiating bank.

8. Copies of Letters of Credit and amendments, if any should be forwarded to the Chief Accountant, Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Colombo, for information.

9. Controller of Exchange will advise you separately of his requirements in this connection.

MONITORING SCHEME ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE DRAWING

AGAINST INTERNATIONAL ELECTRONIC CREDIT. DEBIT

OR ANY OTHER FUND TRANSFER CARDS (EFTCS)

Further to my operating instructions No. EC/09/99(D) of 17th December, 1999 and the subsequent discussion on the subject, Authorised Dealers are hereby informed that the reporting requirement at item 4 of the circular shall be implemented with effect from 1st July, 2000 by those who have to change their computer programmes. Until then, as agreed, those Authorised Dealers are required to report all single transactions in respect of each EFTC where the value of the transaction exceeds US$ 3,000 or its equivalent in any foreign currency to the Monitoring Unit of the Exchange Control Department.

2. Also as agreed, in the case of an EFTC to be issued to a director/representative/employee of a company or institution, where expenses are to be debited to the account of the company or institution, the income tax file number that should be indicated in Form 3 should be that of the company or institution. In the case of applicants for EFTCs who are not income tax payers, he/she could make an endorsement to that effect in the relevant space in the application form.

3. EFTCs could also be issued to holders of NRFC, RNNFC, RFC and FCBU Accounts irrespective of their residential status provided that the expenditure incurred on such EFTCs will be debited only to above mentioned accounts.

4. The requirement to surrender cards when leaving the country does not apply to holders of NRFC, RNNFC, RFC and FCBU Accounts. Instead, prior to their departure from Sri Lanka, they should inform the bank that issued the EFTC of the date from which they would be abroad and thereafter, any expenditure they incur should be debited to the NRFC, RNNFC, RFC and FCBU Accounts.

5. In cases where foreign currency funds in the accounts mentioned above are not adequate to make the debits, no debits should be made to Rupee Accounts of the card holders without my permission. All EFTC holders must be made aware of this.
