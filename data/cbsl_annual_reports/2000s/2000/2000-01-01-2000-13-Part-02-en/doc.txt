Golden Jubilee Celebrations

On 27 August, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

held the celebrations for its Golden Jubilee,

having been established on 28 August 1950. Even

though fifty years of service may.have warranted

greater jubilation, the celebrations were held on

a relatively low key in view of the prevailing

circumstances in the country.

. Following religious ceremonies to mark the?

occasion, it was fitting that the centrepiece of the

celebrations should be the formal opening of the

Bank's new headquarters building, a symbol of

the Bank's resurgence from the greatest tragedy

it has.faced and a tribute to those who had

suffered in it. The opening of the building was by

Her Excellency the President, who though unable

to be present in person, made use of the marvels

of modern technology to deliver her opening

speech. The plaque commemorating the event was

unveiled by the Honourable Professor

G. L, Peiris, in his capacity as the Deputy Minister

of Finance. A distinguished guest and speaker at

thednauguration ceremony was the Right

Honourable Sir Edward George, GBE, Governor

of the Bank of England.

1 The opening ceremony was conducted in the

presence of a large gathering of distinguished

guests, both local and foreign. Among them were

governors and representatives from the South East

Asia, New Zealand and Australia (SEANZA)

grouping of central banks, members of the

diplomatic corp., former senior officials of the

Central Bank, members of the Monetary Board

and employees of the Bank. A feature of the

ceremony was the playing of an anthem composed

for the Central Bank and the performance of a

special musical composition Tndrakeelaya' by

Visharadha Pradeep Ratnayake, commissioned for

the Golden Jubilee, which attracted much critical

acclaim. In addition, a stamp and a special first

day cover were issued by the Postal Department,

while the Bank issued a commemorative

anniversary coin and a publication 'History of

Coins and Currency in Sri Lanka'.

The day's proceedings closed with the

performance of excerpts from the stylised play

'Maname' originally composed and directed by

the late Professor Ediriweera Sarathchandra at a

dinner hosted by? the. Governor for SEANZA

governors, members of the banking community;

senior officers of the Central Bank and

representatives of the employees.

As stated by several speakers at the opening

ceremony, the Central Bank had served Sri Lanka

and her people for fifty years. These Golden

Jubilee celebrations were to be a reflection of this

and the starting point of service for many more

years.

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

Modernisation of the Bank

The Bank embarked on a programme to modernise

itself with the objective of developing a more efficient,

professional and compact organisation. The challenges

posed by rising globalisation and new thinking on

economic policy and the role of central banks in a

changing world gave rise to the need for this change.

The reform process was initiated by organising a

'Retreat' to review current policies and work practices.

The Retreat on 'The Central Bank - Entering the New

Millennium' was held on 8 and 9 July 2000 at the Central

Bank. The Retreat consisted of six sessions in which

groups made presentations on the following subjects:

• Why the Central Bank should change

• A revision of the objectives of the Central Bank

• Process to be pursued to achieve the prioritised

objectives

• New skills and incentives needed to achieve the

objectives

• How the Central Bank should activate

modernisation

• Strategic moves to be adopted to complete the

modernisation process.

The Retreat was organised by a Steering Committee

and attended by over sixty participants. This collective

'brain-storming' exercise provided an opportunity for a

broad cross section of the staff to air their views and to

facilitate a wider discussion with the senior management.

The Retreat emphasised the importance of change

within the Central Bank and identified several key areas

where change was necessary. These included the

clarification and prioritisation of objectives, organisation

structure, management processes and human resource

management.

The work involved in the modernisation programme

was entrusted to a permanent Steering Committee for the

Modernisation of the Central Bank. The objective of the

modernisation programme and the terms of reference of

the Steering Committee are as follows:

1. Reorienting the Central Bank towards its

identified primary objectives of price stability and

financial system stability. This would involve

reviewing the other objectives and re-evaluating

the role of the Central Bank in these areas.

2. Developing an efficient functional organisation

structure which focuses on the core functions of

the Central Bank. The support functions are

important to the extent that they serve the Bank

to perform its core functions effectively and

efficiently.

3. Developing a management culture and processes

that facilitate shorter and quicker reporting,

promote employee creativity, greater participation

in the work process, greater sense of ownership

and accountability and the building of leadership

skills.

4. Developing a human resource management system

that recognises the importance of human resource skills.

This involves redesigning all the human resource

functions, viz. recruitment, compensation, performance

evaluation, promotion and training.

The Steering Committee appointed five Focus

Groups comprising staff from all levels of the Bank to

make recommendations in the areas listed below:

(a) Re-defining the Objectives of the Bank in the

context of a central bank functioning in a modern

era.

(b) The determination of an appropriate

Organisational Structure for the Central Bank of

Sri Lanka that enables it to perform its functions

more effectively.

(c) Examination of the Management Processes of the

Bank and re-designing the same to achieve

efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

, (d) Developing a new system of Human Resource

Management that is merit based and which

continuously upgrades the skills of staff and

promotes productivity.

(<?) Developing proper strategies for Consensus

Building among the staff to carry through the

modernisation programme.

The Focus Groups completed their reports in time as

scheduled. The Steering Committee has formulated the

first set of proposals and prepared an 'Action Plan' for the

modernisation of the Bank. The first stage of the

implementation process is currently underway. In order to

determine the details of the various aspects of the Action

Plan, several task forces were also appointed to examine

and report on Cadre Requirements, Reorganisation of

Departments, Information Technology, Public Debt

Management, Records Management, Committee System

and the Delegation of Authority.

The modernisation programme is being supported by

the World Bank and the Swedish International

Development Agency (SIDA).

Part I! Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

Accounts and Banking Operations

1. Accounts and Accounting Policies

a. Accounts

(i) Assets

The total assets/liabilities of the Central Bank as at the end of

2000, stood at Rs.217,191 million recording an increase of

8.3 per cent over the previous year. The growth in assets is

mainly due to an increase in the Bank's holdings of government

and government guaranteed securities and loans and advances

to government. The share of the international reserves in the

total assets in the meantime, declined from 54.0 per cent in

1999 to 35.5 per cent in 2000. The main items contributing to

the drop in international reserves were the repayment of foreign

public debt, payments to the International Monetary Fund

(IMF) and the net sales of foreign exchange to commercial

banks.

The domestic assets of the Bank registered a substantial

increase from Rs.62,598 million as at end of 1999 to

Rs. 107,914 million as at end of 2000 or by 72.4 per cent. This

was mainly due to the increased holdings of government

securities i.e. Treasury bills and Treasury bonds, as part of the

Central Bank's Open Market Operations, particularly in the

latter part of the year, to address the shortfall of rupee liquidity

in the market. Meanwhile, the medium and long term credit

facilities granted to commercial banks and other credit

institutions continued to decline and recorded a 29 per cent drop

in 2000 partly due to repayments of those loans and the

provisions made for non-performing loans. No short-term

advances were granted to commercial banks in 2000.

(ii) Liabilities

On the liabilities side, 'other liabilities and accounts' became

the largest category, accounting for 36 per cent of the total

liabilities of the Bank. A detailed breakdown of this item is

given in Table II-2. Currency in circulation increased from

Rs.70,210 million in 1999 to Rs.73,316 million in 2000 or by

4.4 per cent. Liabilities under deposits accounted for 27.2 per

cent of the total liabilities of the Bank, of which, the deposits

held by the government increased by 28.0 per cent. The deposits

maintained by commercial banks under the Statutory Reserve

Requirement (SRR), increased by 5.0 per cent. The total

deposits of international organisations, foreign governments and

foreign banking institutions declined by 17.0 per cent. A

comparison of major components of assets and liabilities of the

Bank is shown in Table II-2.

(iii) Income

The total gross income of the Bank for the year 2000 was

Rs.26,495 million compared with Rs. 18,675 million in 1999.

Foreign income generated through the management of the

international reserves of the Bank amounted to 53 per cent of

the total net income, as against 71 per cent of the total net

income, in 1999. Interest income from domestic sources

accounted for 47.5 per cent in 2000 compared with 29.4 per

cent in 1999, reflecting increased earnings from a higher

volume of reverse repurchase transactions. The asset-turnover

rate, i.e. total income as a percentage of average total assets,

which reflects the operating efficiency of the Bank, increased

from 9.6 per cent in 1999 to 12.7 per cent in 2000.

(iv) Expenditure

The gross expenditure of the Bank increased from Rs. 15,475

million in 1999 to Rs.22,495 million in 2000. Of this, 10.6 per

cent was on account of administrative expenditure, while

68.3 per cent consisted of interest payments. After making

allowances for expenditure, allocation to reserves, provisions

for depreciation, bad debts etc., the balance net profit of

Rs.4,000 million was paid and credited to the Consolidated

Fund of the Government in terms of Section 39(c) of the

Monetary Law Act.

b. Accounting Policies

(i) General

The accompanying Balance Sheet and the Profit and Loss

Account have been prepared on the historical cost basis and in

conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

(ii) Foreign Currency Conversion

Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have

been converted at the middle rate of exchange prevailing at the

date of the Balance Sheet.

(iii) Investments

All investments are valued at cost.

(iv) Advances

Advances shown in the Balance Sheet are net of provisions made on the following basis against non-performing loans due

from finance companies:

reserves in terms of Section 38 of the Monetary Law

Act.

2. Banking Operations

(a) General

In line with the Central Bank's main objectives, namely, the stabilisation of the domestic and external value of the rupee, the Banking Department (BKD) continued to carry out its functions in the areas of foreign exchange operations, the management of international reserves of the country and implementation of monetary policy and also functioned as banker to the Government and commercial banks. Further it provided other special services as discussed herein.

(b) Foreign Exchange Operations and Management of International Reserves

In keeping with its main objective, the Central Bank was committed to maintaining the external value of rupee in line with market trends. Accordingly, the value of the rupee against other currencies was permitted to be determined in the market guided by the Central Bank by announcing daily its buying and

selling rates of the US dollar. With a view to allowing the

commercial banks to operate more freely in the foreign

exchange market in a dynamic manner, the spread between the

buying and selling rates of the Central Bank for the US dollar

was widened from 2 per cent to 5 per cent on 20 June 2000.

The widening of the spread was expected to facilitate the

determination of the market rates for the US dollar based on

the supply and demand for it in the domestic foreign exchange

market and also on developments in international markets. The

spread was further expanded to 6 per cent on 3 November, and

to 8 per cent on 11 December 2000.

In a bid to even out the temporary demand and supply

mismatches in the relatively thin local forex market, and to

promote its orderly development, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

continued to engage in foreign exchange operations with

Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) by way of spot purchases

and sales of US dollars against Sri Lanka rupees as an when it

was considered necessary. Daily exchange rate management

was done carefully with the objectives of developing the foreign

exchange market and financial system stability. The Bank's

intervention in the market was mainly to reduce speculative

transactions and to keep the exchange rate at reasonable levels,

especially in the face of increased energy and security related

imports. The Central Bank's transactions in the foreign

exchange market during 2000 resulted in net sales of US dollars

301.6 million. The Central Bank's buying and selling rates for

the US dollar, which stood at Rs.71.3642 and Rs.72.8059

respectively, at the beginning of the year 2000, were Rs.76.9850

and Rs.83.1346 respectively at the end of the year.

In order to activate the local foreign exchange market, the

Bank liaised closely with the Sri Lanka Forex Association and

the Sri Lanka Banks' Association. Special emphasis was given

to the need by local commercial banks to make two-way quotes

for foreign exchange. The Central Bank played a key role in

encouraging commercial banks, sometimes co-ordinating with

the relevant institutions for the banks to obtain a Reuters screen

updating facility for the purpose of making two-way quotes.

As a result of this effort, the number of commercial banks

having the facility increased from 03 at the beginning of the

year to 15 at the end of the year. Measures were also taken to

provide an alternative screen updating facility, on a temporary

basis, for those commercial banks that were not yet ready to

obtain the Reuters updating facility, by using the Wide Area

Network (WAN) of the Central Bank. A further facility to

provide market interest rate and exchange rate quotes at half

hourly intervals to the senior management of the Bank was

developed and implemented in the Banking Department.

Foreign reserve management was done by the Central Bank

with the objective of maximising its return through investments

in foreign financial assets while maintaining a high level of

liquidity and a low level of risk. Accordingly, the majority of

investments were in fixed income securities designated in US

dollars, Sterling pounds and euros. The total net foreign income

generated through the management of foreign reserves

amounted to Rs.6.6 billion in 2000 as against Rs.6.5 billion in

1999.

(c) Implementation of Monetary Policy

(i) Open Market Operations

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) continued to implement its monetary policy mainly through Open Market Operations (OMO). The OMO included outright buying or selling of government securities and repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions. The collateral used for repurchase transactions were Treasury bills, while for reverse repurchase transactions both Treasury bills and Treasury bonds were accepted.

I, Outright Transactions in the Secondary Window

The total outright sales (discounting) of Treasury bills to the participating institutions which include Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) and Primary Dealers (PDs), at the secondary window of the Central Bank amounted to Rs. 15,675 million in 2000, recording more than a two fold increase when compared with Rs.6,982 million in 1999. The main contributory factor for this increase was the decision of the Central Bank to physically deliver the Treasury bills to the purchasers, providing them with an opportunity to use them for trading in the market.

( V I I )

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

In the past, the bills sold were held in CBSL custody, while

only a receipt was given to the purchaser. Out of the total

volume of Treasury bills sold, more than 50 per cent were sold

during the first quarter of the year. There was a substantial drop

in the Treasury bill sales during the balance part of the year,

as market liquidity dried up during that period. Outright sales

and purchases of Treasury bills by the CBSL are given in

Chart I.

There was a gradual increase in the yield rates of

government securities during the year. For instance, the Central

Bank's discounting yield rates on 3-month, 6-month and

12-month maturities increased from 11.57 per cent, 12.09 per

cent and 12.39 per cent per annum respectively, at the

beginning of the year, to 17.86 per cent, 17.88 per cent and

18.96 per cent per annum respectively, at the end of the year.

The total outright purchases (re-discounting) of Treasury bills

by the Central Bank increased from Rs. 1,443 million in 1999

to Rs.2,105 million in 2000, recording an increase of 46 per

cent, as a result of a large and continuous liquidity shortage in

the market, particularly during the latter part of the year. Some

participating institutions preferred to re-discount Treasury bills

rather than use the reverse repurchase facility to borrow from

CBSL to meet their long-term liquidity shortages. The Central

Bank's re-discounting yield rates, which are linked to the

Primary Market's Yield Rates (PMYR), also increased sharply

during the year. Re-discounting yield rates on Treasury bills

of 3-month, 6-month and 12-month maturities increased from

14.29 per cent, 14.79 per cent and 15.27 per cent per annum

respectively, at the beginning of the year, to 21.27 per cent,

21.40 per cent and 21.72 per cent per annum respectively at

the end of the year.

2. R e p u r c h a s e ( R e p o ) T r a n s a c t i o n s

The total volume of Treasury bills sold under repurchase

agreements during 2000 was Rs. 110,476 million as against

Rs.307,795 million sold in 1999. The drop in the total

repurchase volume in 2000 was the result of the large liquidity

shortage that prevailed in the money market particularly during

the latter part of 2000.

The overnight repo rate, which was 9.25 per cent per

annum at the beginning of the year, was gradually reduced

during the first half of the year, for e.g. to 9.00 per cent by 6

April 2000. However, as the market liquidity tightened, the repo

rate was increased to 9.25 per cent on 9 May 2000 and then

increased to 9.50 per cent on 8 June 2000, to 11.0 per cent on

26 July 2000, to 11.75 per cent on 31 August 2000, to 12.50

per cent on 26 September 2000, to 13.0 per cent on 29

September 2000, to 15.0 per cent on 8 November 2000 and to

17.0 per cent on 21 November 2000. The increase in the repo

rate was made along with the increases in reverse repo rate not

only to reduce undue pressure on the exchange rate, but also

keep these rates in line with the trend of increasing interest rates

in the market.

3, Reverse R e p u r c h a s e T r a n s a c t i o n s

In 2000, the reverse repurchase transactions played a major role

in providing liquidity to the market, in addition to stabilising

the upper end of the inter-bank call money market rate.

Reflecting the large and continuous liquidity shortfall in the

system, the volume of overnight reverse repo transactions of

the Central Bank increased significantly during 2000 (Charts

III and IV). The total value of reverse repo transactions of the

Central Bank amounted to Rs.2,075,098 million, recording

about a nine fold increase from Rs.213,349 million in 1999.

The total value of the reverse repo transactions against Treasury

bills increased form Rs.137,829 million in 1999 to Rs.252,581

million in 2000 recording an increase of 83 per cent. The total

value of reverse-repo transactions against Treasury bonds also

showed a substantial increase from Rs.75,520 million in 1999

to Rs. 1,826,518 million in 2000. Monthly reverse repo volumes

and rates are shown in Chart III.

The overnight reverse repurchase rate decreased from

13.48 per cent at the beginning of the year to 13.00 per cent

(ii) Bank Rate

The Central Bank's rate of interest (Bank Rate) on short-term advances to Licensed Commercial Banks stipulated under Section 87 of the Monetary Law Act was increased on three occasions in 2000 i.e. from 16 per cent to 18 per cent per annum on 2 October 2000, from 18 per cent to 20 per cent on 8 November 2000 and from 20 per cent to 25 per cent on 21 November 2000.

(iii) Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR)

The Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR) against deposit

liabilities denominated in Sri Lanka rupees remained at 11 per

cent during the year 2000. The SRR on deposit liabilities

denominated in foreign currencies was withdrawn with effect

from 4 August 2000.

(iv) Short-term Credit

Licensed Commercial Banks which provided roll-over credit

facilities to farmer borrowers prior to the termination of the

New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS) were

granted refinance facilities only to the extent of the rolled over

amount with effect from April 1994. The total amount

outstanding under this facility (i.e. Rs.12 million) was fully

recovered during 2000.

(v) Medium and Long-term Credit

The Medium and Long-term Credit Fund (MLCF) remained

unchanged at Rs.4,925 million during 2000. The amount repaid

during the year was Rs. 104.3 million, while there was a

disbursement of Rs.50.0 million to Bank of Ceylon under the

Finance Companies Act, No.78 of 1988. The total amount of

outstanding credit released to finance companies from the

MLCF before provision for bad debts was Rs.2,654 million as

at the end of 2000.

(d) Functions as the Banker to the Government and Commercial Banks

(i) Financial Institutions Accounts

The Banking Department continued to provide current account facilities to commercial banks and selected other non - bank financial institutions to ensure an efficient payment and settlement system. With the initiative to automate the primary issue of government debt securities by setting up a central depository system for same, at the Central Bank, the Banking Department had to introduce an Electronic Fund Transfer System (EFTS) to facilitate the settlement of transactions among participants at the primary auctions for government securities as well as for settlement of transactions of commercial banks and of the government. As an initial step in this direction, the activities of the Current Accounts Division was fully automated, and test runs for the EFTS were commenced. The BKD was also associated in preliminary work relating to the establishment of a 'Real Time Gross Settlement System' (RTGS). See Box 11.

(ii) Government Accounts

As banker to the government, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, continued to maintain accounts of government departments, government agencies and institutions and certain statutory boards, providing them with required banking facilities. The total number of government accounts maintained by the Bank stood at 140 as at the end of 2000.

( I X )

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

(iii) Import Duty Rebate to Exporters

The Bank reimbursed, on behalf of the government, a total sum

of Rs.241 million to Licensed Commercial Banks in 2000, in

respect of import duty rebates paid by them to exporters, as

against a total sum of Rs.349 million in 1999.

(iv) Subsidy and Ex-gratia Payments to Indian Repatriates

Total subsidy payments made on behalf of the government to

repatriated estate workers of Indian origin under the

Indo-Ceylon Agreement of 1964, amounted to Rs.187,259 in

2000, compared with Rs.73,750 in 1999. Ex-gratia payments

amounted to Rs. 18,975 in 2000 against Rs.3,300 in 1999.

(e) Other Special Services

(i) Foreign Finance

The Banking Department continued to handle disbursements

and repayments of various foreign loans and grants under

foreign funded development projects, namely projects funded

by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the

Japan Bank for International Co-operation (JBIC) and the

International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).

Disbursement of funds under ten new project loans granted by

international organisations and foreign governments was

commenced during the year under review. The BKD also

continued to collect Counterpart Funds under various foreign

loans and grants on behalf of the government and invested such

funds in Treasury bills on requests made by donor agencies.

Further, the BKD continued to issue the guarantees to various

institutions on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka.

(ii) Refinance Facilities under Foreign Funded Projects

The BKD continued to provide refinance to Participatory Credit Institutions under the Plantation Sector Reform Project (PSRP) and Urban Development Low Income Housing Shelter Programme (UDLDHSP) which was introduced in the latter part of 1999. Disbursement of refinance under the Southern Province Rural Development Project (SPRDP) and the North Western Province Water Resource Development Project (NWP/ WRDP) was completed during 2000.

(iii) Compulsory Savings Fund

The Central Bank continued to be the custodian of the monies

collected under the Compulsory Savings Act, No. 6 of 1971

and the Ceiling on Income and Compulsory Savings Law,

No. 15 of 1972, and continued to administer the Compulsory

Savings Fund on behalf of the government. As at 31 December

2000, there was a balance of Rs.72 million in the Fund.

(iv) Asian Clearing Union

1. Trade with ACU Countries in 2000

The total value of transactions routed through the ACU

mechanism increased from Rs.42,724 million in 1999 to

Rs.66,111 million in 2000. This has widened the gap between

the payment for imports and receipts from exports, under the

scheme from Rs.36,685 million in 1999 to Rs.53,732 million

in 2000. A significant increase in imports from India and Iran

was observed in the trade data.

2. Meeting of the Board of Directors and Decisions Taken

The 29th meeting of the Board of Directors of the Asian

Clearing Union was held in May 2000 in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

At this meeting, the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan joined

the ACU as its newest member. The membership of the Union

now stands at eight. Instructions were issued in October 2000

to local commercial banks to commence settlements of trade

with Bhutan through the ACU with effect from October 2000.

The Board of Directors of the ACU at the May 2000

meeting focused their attention on the recommendations of the

Technical Committee to explore the possibilities of expanding

the membership of the Union. The Board of Directors after

deliberations on the report of the committee unanimously

adopted most of the suggestions made by the committee,

especially the expansion of the Union by persuading some

selected countries to join the Union and to create a fund with

contributions of member countries to facilitate the work of the

ACU Secretariat in persuading new entrants to the Union.

Among other matters agreed upon at the meeting were the

introduction of 'torn' basis transactions in addition to existing

'spot' basis transactions and upgrading of financial

communication technology to reduce delays in settlement.

Currency Issue

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka, as the sole currency issuing

authority, continued to perform the functions of issuing legal

tender for the use of domestic transactions during the year 2000.

The volume of currency notes and coins in circulation by the

end of 2000 stood at Rs.73,316 million, as against Rs.70,210

million as at the end of 1999. Notes in circulation comprised

96.1 per cent of the total currency in circulation.

To coincide with the 50th Anniversary of the Central Bank

in August 2000, the Bank issued a crown size silver

commemorative proof coin in the denomination of Rs. 1,000.

The obverse of the coin depicts the Central Bank building and

the reverse depicts the symbol of the sun surrounded by eight

auspicious symbols, referred to as the Astamangala.

The Bank also issued a commemorative coin in the

denomination of one rupee to mark the 50th Anniversary of the

Sri Lanka Navy celebrated in December 2000. The cupro-nickel

coins have been minted in frosted proof condition and nickel

plated steel coins in brilliant uncirculated condition.

Arrangements were also made towards the end of the year

to mint a commemorative coin in the denomination of one

rupee to mark the 50th Anniversary of the Sri Lanka Air Force

which falls in March 2001. Details of all commemorative coins

( X )

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

and notes available for sale at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka,

together with their selling prices, are given in Table II—5.

The Bank made arrangements to issue a new coin folder

containing all coins from one cent to 10 rupees that are

currently in circulation. The pyramid shaped folder has been

designed as a table top and is sold as a collectors' item.

A limited edition of a book titled 'History of Coins and

Currency in Sri Lanka' written by Mr. G. P. S. H. de Silva was

published by the Bank on the occasion of its 50th Anniversary.

The book, which is of benefit and value to students,

numismatists and the general public, is the only source of

information covering all periods of the country's history of

coins i.e., from the 3rd Century BC, upto the dawn of the new

millennium, complete with illustrations. The book, with

improvements, will be published in the early part of 2001 to

be sold to the public.

The Currency Department has made arrangements to

upgrade the automated currency processing systems which were

first commissioned in 1992. When upgraded, the systems will

have the same capacity as a new CSI Currency Processing

System machine which will facilitate the currency processing

work of the Department.

The Department continued to conduct seminars on

Identification of Counterfeit Notes for school children,

government employees and the general public.

The Currency Department launched a coin collecting

programme during the second half of 2000 in selected places

of religious worship, where there had been a high accumulation

of coins. The Department was able to collect 6.4 million coins

under the above programme. If these were to be minted, they

would cost around Rs.15.5 million. After allowing for the

expenses of the project, the net saving to the Bank amounted

to approximately Rs.15.3 million.

The currency operation sections of the Department, which

were housed in the Treasury Building were shifted to the

Central Bank New Building in March 2000. The Cash

Exchange Counters continued function from the Moors Islamic

Cultural Home Building. The currency operation sections of the

Anuradhapura and Matara Regional Offices continued their

activities of issuing and receiving currency in the respective

regions.

Bank Supervision

The Bank Supervision Department (BSD) discharges the

regulatory and supervisory function of the Central Bank relating

to banking institutions. The BSD carries out these activities

under the Banking Act and the Monetary Law Act. Banking

institutions that are currently under regulation and supervision

of the BSD are Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) and

Licensed Specialised Banks (LSBs). The objective of regulation

and supervision is to ensure that banks are operated in a prudent

manner in order to ensure the safety and soundness of the

banking system, and to safeguard the interests of depositors.

As in the previous years, regulatory and supervisory activities

were carried out using periodic on-site examinations and off-

site surveillance of banks. In addition, BSD has issued

prudential directions and guidelines in respect of banking

activities. The BSD also administers the voluntary Deposit

Insurance Scheme. In July 2000, activities of the BSD were

expanded by entrusting it with the activities of the Banking

Development Department, consequent to a decision of the

Monetary Board to amalgamate the activities of the Banking

Development Department with the BSD. Accordingly,

recommendations in respect of licensing and closure of banks,

and the opening, closing, relocation of bank branches and other

customer service offices of banks became part of the activities

of the BSD in 2000.

Approvals for New Banks and Bank Branches

During 2000, a licence was issued under Section 76C of the Banking Act to Ceylinco Savings Bank Ltd., a locally incorporated banking institution, to operate as a LSB. Further,

approval was granted, in principle, to the NDB Housing Bank

Ltd., another locally incorporated LSB, to engage in housing

finance. ANZ Grindlays Bank Ltd., a branch of a foreign bank

which has been operating in Sri Lanka since 1881, was

renamed the Standard Chartered Grindlays Bank Ltd. as a result

of the acquisition abroad of ANZ Grindlays Bank Ltd. by

Standard Chartered Bank Ltd. National Mercantile Bank Ltd.,

which was issued with a license as a LCB in the previous year,

commenced banking operations in May 2000. At the end of

the year, 26 LCBs and 12 LSBs were in operation and came

under the regulation and supervision of the BSD.

During the year, approvals were granted to commercial

banks for the opening of a total of 24 branches, 22 extension

offices, 49 student savings units locally and one representative

office overseas. Changes of location of 53 branches of both

LCBs and LSBs were also approved during the year.

Several requests made by commercial banks seeking

approval for investment in subsidiaries, launching of new

financial products, and alterations to their Memoranda and

Articles of Association were also attended to by Bank

Supervision Department.

Prudential Regulations and Directions

The BSD continued to monitor the compliance by banking

institutions with regulatory requirements introduced under the

provisions of the Banking Act, No. 30 of 1988 as amended by

the Banking (Amendment) Act, No. 33 of 1995. These

requirements relate to;

i. The maintenance of minimum capital ratios,

ii. The maintenance of minimum liquid assets ratio,

iii. Adherence to the single borrower limit,

iv. Limits on share ownership in banks,

v. Limits on investment by banks in equity in public quoted

companies and private companies,

vi. Classification of non-performing advances, suspension of

interest on non-performing advances and provisioning for

bad and doubtful debts,

vii. Limits on accommodation granted to directors of banks,

their close relations and concerns in which they have a

substantial interest,

viii. Acquisition and purchase of immovable property by

banks,

ix. Publication of unaudited half yearly accounts and annual

audited accounts in newspapers,

and

x. Submission of annual audited financial statements in time

to the Central Bank.

Directions Issued under the Banking Act during the year 2000

During the year under review, the following directions/

determinations of the Monetary Board were issued by the BSD:

i. Determination made by the Monetary Board under Section

19(4) of the Banking Act, No. 30 of 1988 in respect of

the maximum limit on foreign participation in share capital

of a licensed bank: Accordingly, the foreign participation,

in aggregate, in the share capital of a licensed bank

incorporated in Sri Lanka was increased from a maximum

of 49 per cent to 60 per cent of its total share capital with

effect from 14 February 2000.

ii. A direction relating to revision of the maintenance of

capital adequacy ratios was issued to LCBs and LSBs on

29 November 2000. Accordingly, banks were required to

maintain a minimum statutory capital ratio equivalent to

9 per cent of risk-weighted assets, with core capital

constituting not less than 4.5 per cent, from 01 January

2001. The minimum capital ratio effective from 01

January 2002 will be 10 per cent for total capital, with core

capital constituting not less than 5 per cent.

iii. In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 23,25 and

26 of the Banking Act, the Monetary Board, with the

approval of the Hon. Minister of Finance, made an Order

on 07 April 2000 relating to off-shore banking business

carried on by licensed commercial banks. By this order,

instructions were issued to off-shore units of Licensed

Commercial Banks operating in Sri Lanka relating to their

authorised businesses including business with residents,

withdrawal from & deposits to an account maintained with

an off-shore unit, maintenance of books & records and

qualifications & banking experience of executive officers

of off-shore units.

Off-site Surveillance System

Under the off-site surveillance system, the BSD continued to

monitor the financial condition of the LCBs and LSBs on the

basis of periodic information provided by banks relating to their

operations. The main returns that banks are required to submit

to BSD include the monthly statement of assets and liabilities

and liquid assets, quarterly returns on capital adequacy, income

and expenses, non-performing advances, lending to directors,

investments and the annual audited financial accounts.

The information gathered is analysed to identify trends and

variations. The position of each bank is compared with that of

its peer group as well as the entire banking industry. The

scrutiny of information helps in identifying significant and

unusual changes, and serves as an early warning system to

indicate particular banks or areas requiring further investigation

and examination. On the basis of such observations, banks are

also required to take prompt remedial action on any

shortcomings in order to avoid an adverse impact on their

operations.

The monitoring of Foreign Currency Banking Units is

conducted on the basis of information provided to the BSD

relating to their assets and liabilities, maturity profile of assets

and liabilities and income and expenses. In addition, monitoring

of the performance of the two state commercial banks was

continued on a quarterly basis to ascertain their achievement

( X I I )

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

of targets under the Memoranda of Understanding (MOU)

signed between the government and the two banks.

The BSD was actively involved in the process of

upgrading its off-site surveillance system in a number of ways

during 2000. These included enhancing staff strength, providing

intensive training to upgrade the supervisory skills of the staff,

and improving the quality of off-site analysis while speeding

up the processing of information gathered. The training

component of Phase II of the Technical Assistance Project

funded by the Swedish Government (SIDA Project) was

completed in the middle of 2000. The main focus of the project

is to improve the supervisory techniques and skills of the BSD

through the application of a risk based supervisory approach,

supplemented with the currently used CAMEL (capital, asset

quality, management, earnings, liquidity) standard. This method

of supervision is useful to ascertain the risks that are associated

with the operations of a particular bank and the resources

available with a bank to meet such risks. Under the SIDA

project, various techniques were proposed to upgrade the

supervisory skills of the BSD staff in the off-site supervision

process as well as in the on-site supervision system. During

2000, the BSD has taken steps for the implementation of the

proposed techniques.

The Governor and staff of the Central Bank continued to

meet the Chief Executive Officers of LCBs and LSBs monthly

during the course of the year under review. These meetings

constituted a forum for exchange of views and to discuss issues

relating to banking operations and helped to build a close

relationship between the banks and the Central Bank.

On-site Examinations

Under the provisions of the Monetary Law Act, all banking institutions are subject to periodic statutory examinations, i.e., on-site examinations, conducted by the BSD. At present, each bank is examined once in two years. Examiners of the BSD visit the Head Office and selected branches of each bank depending on the area coverage and volume of business.

The nature and scope of on-site examinations are mostly confined to an appraisal of the quality of assets of banks and to arriving at an overall assessment of their financial condition, on the information gathered from the books of accounts and records. The degree of a bank's exposure to varied banking risks, such as default risk (credit risk), market risk, liquidity risk and operational risks, and a bank's ability to contain such risks, if any, to minimum levels are also appraised in the overall assessment of a bank. As a part of the scope of on-site examinations, other key aspects such as capital adequacy, management quality, earnings and liquidity are also assessed. In addition, banks' compliance with statutory requirements, applicable laws and regulations and internal controls as well as their systems and procedures too are examined. During the year under review, the BSD commenced 14 on-site examinations, which included 10 LCBs and 4 LSBs. In addition, on-site examinations of 7 LCBs and 2 LSBs which commenced in the previous year were concluded in 2000.

Administration of the Deposit Insurance Scheme

The BSD continued to administer the Deposit Insurance

Scheme which commenced operations in 1987. This is a

voluntary deposit insurance scheme open to any deposit taking

institution. At present, only four Multi-Purpose Co-operative

Societies have obtained insurance cover under the scheme in

respect of deposits of their rural banks. The premium payable

is 3.75 cents per quarter for every Rs.100, and the amount paid

to the Deposit Insurance Fund by way of premia in 2000 was

Rs.1.1 million. The fund stood at Rs.102.9 million as at 31

December 2000, together with Rs.50 million allocated by the

Central Bank in 1997. These funds have been invested in

Treasury bills with a face value of Rs. 120.5 million. A Task

Force was appointed to study and make recommendations on

the feasibility of setting up a mandatory Deposit Insurance

Scheme in place of the existing voluntary scheme. The

recommendations of the Task Force will be made in early 2001.

Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions

The Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial

Institutions continued to carry out its regulatory and supervisory

functions in respect of registered finance companies (FCs) with

the objective of ensuring the FCs comply with minimum

prudential requirement stipulated by the Central Bank. The

Department strove to achieve the above objectives mainly

through off-site surveillance and on-site examinations.

The consolidated balance sheet of the 25 registered FCs

as at 31 March 1999 and 31 March 2000 is given in Table

II-6. Total assets of registered FCs have increased by Rs.3,633

million during 2000. The increase in assets was reflected mainly

in the growth of advances by Rs.3,221 million and the liquid

assets by Rs.444 million. There has been no significant change

in the distribution of the major asset categories. However, as

in the previous three years, lease financing continued to expand.

Deposits and capital funds increased by Rs.3,065 million and

Rs.391 million, respectively.

Off-site Surveillance

During the period under review, the Department continued its

off-site surveillance of the 25 registered FCs by analysing

periodical statements submitted by these companies. These

under the Act. The Directions include minimum capital

requirement, liquidity ratio, single borrower limits, provisioning

for bad and doubtful debts etc. The early warning system was

continued to identify and arrest any adverse developments.

On-site Examination

The Department conducted on-site examinations of three FCs

during the year. The books of accounts and other records were

scrutinised and discussions held with officers of the companies

in order to make an appraisal of capital adequacy, asset quality,

management efficiency, earnings and liquidity. Internal controls

and systems and the companys' compliance with statutory

requirements were also examined.

In addition, spot examinations of the finance companies

were conducted prior to the issue of annual licences for 2001.

In these examinations, critical areas which were identified in

the course of off-site examination were scrutinised.

Failed Finance Companies

Of the nine failed finance companies whose administration and

management were earlier vested in the Monetary Board under

the Finance Companies Act, four companies were under

liquidation as at the end of 2000. The administration and

management of the remaining five companies continued to be

vested in the Monetary Board. The petition for liquidation is

pending in Court with respect to one such company. During

the year, a liquidator was appointed to another failed finance

company, which was not vested in the Monetary Board, but had

been granted a refinance loan by the Central Bank.

Of the five companies which continued to be vested in the

Monetary Board, three companies continued making relief

payments to depositors during the year. One such company was

making an enhanced relief payment of 15 per cent of the

balance capital outstanding, while another company was

making full payment of the capital. The third company

continued to make full payment of capital with revised interest

to all the depositors. These relief payments were made out of

funds made available to these companies as refinance loans in

previous years as well as out of proceeds realized from sale of

company assets and through loan recoveries. No payments were

made to depositors by the other two companies during the year,

since one company had exhausted its funds and liquidation

proceedings had commenced in respect of the other, which

prevented any further repayments being made to depositors.

The Central Bank has lodged claims for the total amount

due on outstanding refinance loans with accumulated interest

as well as on amounts due in respect of administrative

expenditure, with the liquidators of four failed finance

companies who were appointed during the year. Out of the

other companies to which refinance loans had been granted, one

company repaid Rs.0.3 million during the year. A state bank

received refinance amounting to Rs.50 million in respect of a

loan granted to one of the failed finance companies, under an

agreement entered into with the Central Bank earlier.

Policy Initiatives

During the year the Department had several discussions with

the Finance Houses Association on proposals to amend

prudential Directions issued by the Monetary Board on lending,

liquid assets, deposits and share investments of finance

companies. Meanwhile, the members of the Leasing

Association and the Finance Houses Association were consulted

with regard to implementation of the provisions of the Finance

Leasing Act, No.56 of 2000 which was enacted in August 2000.

Development Finance

The Development Finance Department performs the following

functions -

(i) Re-lending of loan proceeds from external lines of credit

to Participating Credit Institutions (PCIs) for financing

of project activities of Small and Medium Enterprises

(SMEs);

(ii) Issuing of credit guarantees on loans disbursed to finance

such projects, collecting guarantee premia and

administering credit guarantee funds; and

(iii) Undertaking post-credit inspection and follow-up action

to ensure proper utilisation of loan funds with a view to

preventing defaults.

The activities of the Development Finance Department

continued to expand in 2000 due to accelerated loan

disbursements under the Urban Development & Low Income

Housing Sector Project (UDLIHSP) and the Plantation Reform

Project (PRP). The UDLIHSP commenced its operations during

the first half of 1999 with financial assistance of US dollars

20 million from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). During

1999, due to an insufficient number of financial institutions that

were eligible to participate in the project, the progress of the

project was slow. However, with the inclusion of three more

financial institutions as PCIs in July 2000, a large volume of

funds was disbursed during 2000. Disbursement of loan funds

under the Plantation Reform Project continued unabated in

2000.

The issue of credit guarantee covers issued by the

Department under the Small and Medium Term Assistance

Project (SMAP), by and large, were concluded in the year under

review due to full utilisation of loan balances by the PCIs.

However guarantee covers are being issued in respect of loans

disbursed under the PRP.

The Department continued to conduct project inspections

and follow-up work in respect of current credit schemes as well

as those already concluded. Details of activities performed by

the Department in 2000 are described below.

Current Credit Schemes

Plantation Reform Project (PRP)

The total value of approvals of refinance under the PRP stood

( X V )

Part II Central Bank ot Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

at Rs.1,211 million during 2000 as against Rs.1,513 million in

1999. The moderate level of approvals in 2000 was mainly due

to higher utilisation (approximately 90 per cent) of the loan

funds from the ADB and the Japan Bank for International

Co-operation (JBIC) in the previous years. However, the total

fund disbursements stood at Rs. 1,300 million as at the end of

2000 due to disbursement in 2000 in respect of some refinance

approvals granted in the previous year. During the 1996 to 2000

period, the total disbursements under the project were Rs.4,677

million. Details of refinance approvals and disbursements are

given in the Table II—7.

As in the previous years, the largest portion of the loan,

to the value of Rs.885 million, was approved for tree crop

development. Disbursement of funds for this category during

2000 was Rs.947 million, which included a part of refinance

approved in 1999. Under the category of processing,

improvement and pollution control, Rs.270 million was

approved as refinance, while Rs.271 million was disbursed.

Similarly, under the category of purchasing of service vehicles

and equipment, Rs.56 million was approved as refinance and

the sum disbursed amounted to Rs.82 million.

Among the Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) in

the scheme, Seylan Bank Ltd! (SBL) accounted for 28.3 per

cent of the total disbursements to Regional Plantation

Companies (RPCs), amounting to Rs.368 million during 2000.

DFCC Bank, Bank of Ceylon (BOC), National Development

Bank (NDB), Sampath Bank Ltd. (SMBL), Commercial Bank

of Ceylon Ltd. (CBC) and Hatton National Bank Ltd. (HNB)

accounted for disbursements amounting to Rs.362 million

(27.9 per cent), Rs.208 million (16 per cent), Rs.146 million

(11.2 per cent), Rs.94 million (7.2 per cent), Rs.73 million

(5.6 per cent) and Rs.50 million (3.8 per cent), respectively, in

2000. Approvals and disbursements of loan funds under the

PRP loan scheme by each PFI and details of credit guarantee

liability are given in the Table II—8.

The total liability of the Central Bank on account of credit

guarantee cover issued against PRP loan disbursements was

Rs.903 million in 2000. The total liability of the Bank on

account of issue of guarantees under this scheme from 1996 to

2000 amounted to Rs.2,894 million. Premia collected on credit

guarantees under PRP amounted to Rs.60 million in 2000,

whereas the total premia collected for the period 1996 to 2000

amounted to Rs.l 16 million.

Small and Medium Enterprise Assistance Project (SMAP)

The SMAP credit line, which has been disbursed by the

National Development Bank (NDB) since 1997, was almost

drawn down in full during 2000. However, the issue of credit

guarantee covers continues to-date. The number of credit

guarantee covers issued in 2000 was 369 for a total of Rs.685

million, compared with 817 guarantee covers worth Rs.l,187

million issued in 1999. During 2000, 16 guarantees were

withdrawn and 37 guarantees amounting to Rs.49 million were

fully paid. The Central Bank's total guarantee liability under

this scheme at end December 2000 was Rs. 1,459 million and

the total premia collected was Rs.28 million.

Following similar trends in the past few years, the majority

of loans (51.5 per cent) disbursed under SMAP during 2000

which includes service industries, such as passenger and

commercial transport, vehicle servicing, restaurants, service

stations, electronics related industries and services, while about

19 per cent of loans were granted for food, beverages and

tobacco industries. Loans to agro-industries and chemical,

petroleum, rubber and plastic products accounted for 9.3 per

cent and 9.8 per cent, respectively, of the total disbursements

in 2000. Industry-wise classification of loans granted under the

scheme as at end 2000 is illustrated in the Table II—9.

Urban Development & Low Income Housing Sector Project (UDLIHSP)

This scheme commenced operations during the first half of

1999 with financial assistance from a soft loan of US dollars

20 million from the ADB. Refinance approvals and disbursement of loan funds increased rapidly during 2000 as

against low disbursements in 1999. At the initial stage of the

scheme only two financial institutions, out of seven envisaged

in the project, were included as PCIs and the progress of

disbursements was, therefore, slow. However, with the

inclusion of three additional financial institutions as PCIs,

namely, Kandurata Development Bank, Rajarata Development

Bank and the Housing Development Finance Corporation

(HDFC), the loan disbursements increased rapidly. Details of

refinance approvals and disbursements by financial institutions

are given in the Table 11-10. Total refinance approvals

amounted to Rs.l 17 million, of which Rs.35 million was

disbursed during the year under review. The difference between

approvals and disbursements is due to the time taken by PCIs

to submit disbursement applications. The HDFC accounted for

refinance approvals amounting to Rs.86 million and

disbursements amounting to Rs.23 million.

Rural Credit

The Rural Credit Department (RCD) continued to implement

credit components of several credit schemes funded by donors,

the government and lending banks. During the year under

review, the RCD completed successfully the implementation

of two credit schemes of the Southern Province Rural

Development Project (SPRDP) and the North Western Province

Water Resources Development Project (NWP-WRDP). The

Monetary Board approved of the implementation of two new

credit schemes namely, the Asian Development Bank (ADB)

funded Skills Development Project (SDP) and a follow up

credit scheme for Southern Province Rural Development

utilising the Revolving Fund of the project. As the executing

agency for the projects, the Central Bank continued to be

involved in admitting new Participating Financial Institutions

(PFIs), disbursing refinance to PFIs in respect of loans eligible

under projects and monitoring and co-ordinating loan schemes

with the assistance of the relevant project offices and other local

agencies.

In order to address the marketing problem for agricultural

produce, the RCD encouraged farmers and buyers to use

forward contracts for sale agricultural produce at prices

reasonable to both the farmers and the buyers.

During 2000 the administration of the functions of

Regional Offices of the Central Bank was brought under the

purview of the RCD, enhancing the outreach capability of the

credit schemes implemented by the RCD.

The credit schemes of the following projects were

implemented by the Central Bank through the RCD during

2000:-

(a) A D B1 Funded projects:-

(i) Tea Development Project;

(//) Second Perennial Crops Development Project;

(Hi) Southern Province Rural Development Project;

(iv) North Western Province Water Resources Development Project;

(v) North Central Province Rural Development Project; (W) Skills Development Project

(b) IFAD2/CIDA3/SIDA4/Japanese Govt.5/ WFP6/USAID7/JBIC8 Funded Projects:-

(v/7) North Central Province Participatory Rural

Development Project (IFAD, SIDA & WFP);

(viii) Food and Nutrition Promotion Credit Scheme

(Japanese Govt.);

(ix) Poverty Alleviation Microfinance Project (JBIC);

(x) Matale Regional Economic Advancement Project

(IF AD).

(xi) Urban Environmental Infrastructure Development

Project Scheme (USAID).

(c) Government Funded projects:-

(xii) Small Farmers and the Landless Credit Project

(SFLCP);

(xiii) Kegalle District Integrated Rural Development

(Revolving Fund) Project;

(xiv) Surathura Program;

(JCV) Southern Province Rural Development (Revolving

Fund) Project.

Tea Development Project (TDP)

The TDP, which commenced operations in 1999 as a follow

up of the Small Holder Tea Development Project, completed

its first year of operations in 2000. During the year, a good

response was shown by tea smallholders and factory owners

to obtain loans under the credit scheme. This was mainly due

to the increase in prices for tea in world markets and the

favourable weather conditions for planting tea. As a result, the

PFIs were able to disburse loans surpassing the targets set for

the year. The banks disbursed a total sum of Rs.337 million in

2000, which was 117 per cent above the target for

disbursements during the year.

The activities eligible for financing under the project are

replanting of tea, establishment of tea nurseries, rehabilitation

and modernisation of tea factories, purchase of vehicles and

construction of green leaf collection centres. As in the case of

the previous credit scheme for smallholder tea development, a

majority of the loans had been granted for factory rehabilitation,

which was 50 per cent more than the amount targeted for it. A

lower level of loans had been granted for establishment of tea

nurseries due to the difficulties in providing collateral

acceptable to PFIs, such as mortgage of properties, etc. by the

Tea smallholders engaged in development of tea nurseries.

The performance of PFIs shows that DFCC Bank (DFCC)

accounted for 41.7 per cent of total loan disbursements in 2000.

Hatton National Bank (HNB) (16.4 per cent), Commercial Bank

(16 per cent), National Development Bank (NDB) (10.7 per

cent), Sampath Bank (8.9 per cent) and Bank of Ceylon (BOC)

(6.3 per cent) accounted for the balance disbursements. Two

new PFIs, Bank of Ceylon (BOC) and Kandurata Development

Bank (KDB), having satisfied the eligibility criteria for

admission as PFIs, were admitted under the scheme during the

year.

Upto the end of 2000, PFIs together approved 568 loans

amounting to Rs.506 million and disbursed 499 loans

amounting to Rs.372 million. Of these, the Central Bank has

refinanced 236 loans amounting to Rs.217 million.

Second Perennial Crops Development Project (SPCDP)

The SPCDP, a continuation of the First Perennial Crops

Development Project (FPCDP), completed its second year of

operations in 2000. The Project covers the entire island, except

the Northern and Eastern provinces, and is scheduled to be

completed by 2004. The objective of the Project is to support

the development and commercialisation of the perennial crop

sector by providing credit facilities and support services. The

Project consists of 5 major components, viz., (a) credit;

(b) farm advisory, marketing and technical services;

(c) research; (d) seed and planting materials; and

(e) institutional strengthening. The Central Bank handles the

credit part, while the Ministry of Agriculture handles the other

components.

During the year under review, two new PFIs, Bank of

Ceylon (BOC) and Kandurata Development Bank (KDB),

satisfied the ADB criteria for admission as PFI under the credit

scheme. Hence the number of PFIs under the credit scheme

increased to seven. Out of the allocation made for the credit

component, i.e. SDR 11.562 million (approximately Rs.l,155

million), a sum of Rs.295 million has been disbursed to 698

eligible sub-projects by all PFIs at end 2000. The amount

disbursed by PFIs during the year stood at Rs.184 million. The

Central Bank granted a sum of Rs.129 million to PFIs by way

of refinance during the year under review.

In response to a request made by the Central Bank, the

ADB increased the free limit allowed for approval of sub loans

by PFIs from US dollars 50,000 to US dollars 100,000 or its

rupee equivalent. Loans exceeding this amount, up to US

dollars 150,000, require ADB's approval for disbursement.

Further, the ADB was associated in activities relating to

technical assistance for a pilot project for private sector

participation in advisory services for project beneficiaries of

the SPCDP. At present, farm advisory, marketing, technical

services etc. are being handled by the Ministry of Agriculture.

The Ministry has made necessary arrangements to sign

agreements with selected private entities. This move is

considered to be one of the first attempts in Sri Lanka to rely

on the private sector to provide extension services on a

'user-pays' system, where the clients pay directly at commercial

rates for advisory services they receive. The Central Bank, in

collaboration with the project office of the PCDP, conducted

6 training programmes/workshops for managers of branches of

PFIs with a view to motivating them to expedite credit

disbursements under the Project.

Southern Province Rural Development Project (SPRDP)

The Southern Province Rural Development Project (SPRDP),

funded by the ADB, which commenced operations in 1992,

completed its operations on 30 June 2000. The Project was

originally scheduled to be terminated by end 1999, but was

extended by a further six months in order that reimbursements

could be claimed from ADB for loans granted during the latter

half of 1999.

The SPRD Project was implemented with the objective of

raising the income levels and the quality of life of the people

in the Southern Province by creating opportunities for self

employment and income generating activities and strengthening

the economic and social infrastructure in the districts of Galle,

Matara and Hambantota. The target group of the project

included small and marginal farmers, landless labourers, small

and medium industrialists, women and unemployed youth.

Out of the total allocation of Rs.466 million (SDR 6.4

million) for the credit component, Rs.369 million or 79 per cent

was allocated to the Central Bank by the Ministry of Plan

Implementation to provide refinance to PCIs for loans granted

by them for rural micro and small and medium scale industries.

The balance was provided to the Thrift and Credit Co-operative

Societies (TCCS) to facilitate the financing of micro level self-

employment activities. During the project period, the entire

allocation made by the Ministry was utilised to provide

refinance to the PCIs. The Central Bank had released a sum of

Rs.l 6 million by way of refinance to PCIs during the year 2000,

bringing the total refinance provided to Rs.369 million. Loan

disbursements by the PCIs amounted to Rs.18 million in 2000.

Total loan disbursements during the project period were Rs.418

million, of which nearly Rs.50 million or 12 per cent were

contributed by the PCIs from their own funds. The district-wise

performance of the loans granted shows that Matara had the

highest number of loan disbursements with 51 per cent, while

Galle and Hambantota had loan disbursements of 29 per cent

and 20 per cent, respectively.

Ruhuna Development Bank (RDB) and the DFCC had

financed around 7,709 projects during the project period. Out

of the total loan disbursements, around 85 per cent was

disbursed by the RDB. In terms of the number of loans, RDB

had funded 98.5 per cent of the loans and the entirety of these

loans had been micro loans.

The impact evaluation study of the project had rated the

credit programme as one of the successful components of the

Project. The study had also revealed that the RDB had made a

positive attempt to address the acute unemployment problem

in the province by supporting a large number of

self-employment income generating activities. The size of loans

granted by the RDB was within the range Rs.28,000 -

Rs.45,000, and about 44 per cent of the loans granted had been

for self-employment projects. Of the categories of loans,

income generating activities such as trading and

self-employment account for the highest portion of loans

disbursed, whereas the lowest was for the fisheries sector.

Approximately 94 per cent of the projects financed had been

successful, whereas and only 6 per cent had failed.

Southern Province Rural Development Project (Revolving Fund) Credit Scheme (SPRDPCS)

The SPRDP (Revolving Fund) Credit Scheme was introduced

in order to provide refinance to PCIs in respect of loan

instalments approved and not disbursed under the Southern

Province Rural Development Project (SPRDP) which

concluded its operations in June 2000. Funds for operating the

credit scheme were drawn from transferring a sum of Rs.194

million from the loan recoveries and the interest income of the

SPRDP.

The Central Bank entered into an administrative agreement

with the government and subsidiary loan agreements with the

PCIs for implementation of the above credit scheme until a

second line of credit comes into operation. The terms and

conditions of lending under this credit scheme were the same

as those of the SPRDP, except for new loans where the interest

rate was revised downwards. The on-lending rate and the

refinance rate were reduced by 2 per cent per annum for new

loans, and were fixed at 12 per cent and 4 per cent per annum,

respectively.

A total of Rs.38 million had been provided to PCIs as

refinance under this credit scheme upto end 2000.

North Central Province - IFAD Funded Participatory Rural Development Project (NCP-PRDP) and ADB Funded Rural Development Project (NCP- RDP)

The IFAD funded North Central Province Participatory Rural Development Project (NCP-PRDP) and the ADB funded North Central Province Rural Development Project (NCP - RDP), having commenced their operations in 1996 and 1997, respectively, completed the fourth and third years of operation in 2000. Both these projects aimed at alleviating of poverty through the improvement of productivity of farmers and the development of infrastructure facilities in the Districts of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa.

The Central Bank functions as the apex co-ordinating agency for the credit component of both projects and operates through its Regional Office at Anuradhapura. Though the PCIs were to finance sub-loans out of their own funds, for a payment of 2 per cent per loan to cover administration costs and other support services, the disbursement of credit was substantially below expectation. Hence, the total loan disbursements from the inception of the projects amounted to only Rs.3 million. The slow progress of the project was taken into consideration by the officials of the funding agencies, and the government had negotiations with the National Development Trust Fund (NDTF) to explore the possibility of allocating part of the funds to refinance sub loans under the Project. However, having failed to obtain funds from the NDTF, the Mid - Term Review Missions of the ADB and IFAD to Sri Lanka in 2000 agreed to allocate funds from the unutilised funds of these projects for provision of refinance to PCIs. Accordingly, a sum of US dollars 500,000 (approximately Rs.40 million) has now been

allocated by the ADB for the NCP-RDP and US dollars

250,000 (approximately Rs.20 million) by IFAD for the

NCP-PRDP. These credit schemes are expected to continue

operations with a new credit plan once the revisions to the loan

agreements are finalised.

NWP-Water Resources Development Project (NWP-WRDP)

The North Western Province Water Resources Development

Project, which commenced operations in 1992, completed its

activities in June 2000. The project focussed attention on

improving the economic, social and institutional wellbeing of

the rural population in the North Western Province. The Central

Bank functioned as the executing agency for the credit

component of the project, which had a credit allocation of US$

1.8 million (approximately Rs.112 million) for promotion of

farmer owned on-farm irrigation systems with dug wells and

water pumps and for establishment of income generating

activities by rural women. At the inception of the project, the

Regional Development Banks of Puttalam and Kurunegala

(which were later vested with the Wayamba Development

Bank) and Hatton National Bank participated in the credit

scheme, and in 1996, the Bank of Ceylon and the People's Bank

were also included as PCIs in order to improve the outreach

of micro-credit for rural women.

At the completion of the Project in June 2000, PCIs had

disbursed Rs.31 million for the construction of 918 agro-wells

and Rs.81.5 million for self-employment projects of 3,430

women. Under the lift irrigation component, which commenced

operations in 1996,148 projects to a value of Rs.4 million had

been financed. A total of 4,239 sub-loans amounting to Rs.l 12

million had been refinanced by the Project upto its termination,

recording a loan utilisation rate of 100 per cent.

Urban Environmental Infrastructure Development Project Scheme (UEIDP)

The Urban Environmental Infrastructure Development Project (UEIDP) Credit Scheme recorded considerable progress during the year by providing a sum of Rs.32 million as at end 2000, compared to zero disbursement recorded during the previous year. The progress shown in the loan scheme is mainly due to the publicity programme launched by the RCD during the year under review. The RCD also admitted the six Regional Development Banks (Wayamba, Sabaragamuwa, Kandurata, Ruhuna, Rajarata and Uva) in addition to National Development Bank and the Sanasa Development Bank as PCIs under the scheme.

The UEIDP was inaugurated in 1999 and funded by the government through a loan of US$ 4 million raised from the private sector in USA under the Housing Guarantee Loan No.383 HG006 and guaranteed by USAID. The project aimed at promoting the private sector in environmental development, particularly in the urban and semi-urban areas throughout the country. Projects resulting in improvement in community water

( X X I )

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

supply and sanitation, garbage collection and waste water

treatment are some of the environmental development projects,

which qualified for financing under the Project. Municipal

Councils, Urban Councils, Pradeshiya Sabas, private and

Government sector organisations and individual borrowers

undertaking eligible sub-projects mentioned above will be

provided with loans through the PCIs. During the year under

review, Sanasa Development Bank had granted a sum of Rs.30

million for community development, water sanitation and

garbage collection projects and the Regional Development

Banks (Ruhuna and Sabaragamuwa) a sum of Rs.2 million for

a water sanitation project.

The RCD conducted awareness programmes for Regional

Development Banks and local authorities with a view to

expanding credit disbursement under the Project.

Small Farmers and the Landless Credit Project (SFLCP)

The Small Farmers and the Landless Credit Project (SFLCP),

which commenced operations in 1990, continued its activities

in four districts, namely, Puttalam, Kandy, Galle and Matara,

with assistance from the International Fund for Agricultural

Development (IFAD) and the Canadian International

Development Agency (CIDA). The credit delivery mechanism

used by the SFLCP was to grant loans to groups of poor who

were deprived of formal credit due to lack of collateral. The

foreign funding for the project was terminated in December

1997 as scheduled, and in 1999, the Central Bank continued

the project activities by recycling the loan recoveries in terms

of the Agreement with IFAD. The Central Bank recalled its

personnel seconded for management of the project district

offices and arrangements have now been made to obtain staff

from the RDBs in the relevant districts to co-ordinate the field

operations of the Project.

At the end 2000, the Project had covered 2,450 villages

in the four project districts and had formed 10,281 self-help

groups as the vehicle for providing assistance to beneficiaries.

The beneficiaries, numbering 61,752, were reached through

these groups which is well above the target of 32,000 set in

the project design. A noteworthy feature in the Project has been

the active and predominant participation of 42,867 women,

accounting for 69 per cent of the total beneficiaries. At the end

of the year, a sum of Rs.594 million had been advanced as

micro-loans to enable the borrowers to undertake income

generating self-employment activities. The average size of a

loan amounted to Rs. 10,245. The Project has consistently

maintained a cumulative recovery rate of over 97.3 per cent.

In addition, the beneficiaries had saved Rs.78 million as group

savings up to the end of 2000 under the savings mobilisation

scheme of the Project.

In 2000, as in the previous years, loan recoveries were

recycled to provide refinance to the Regional Development

Banks, while the interest income earned by investing excess

funds was utilised to meet the administration and beneficiary

training expenditure of the Project.

The Central Bank continued to set up Isuru Development

Societies by allowing the self-help groups (SHGs) to

amalgamate themselves into formal corporate bodies during

2000. This was a scheme inaugurated in 1997 to facilitate

matured SHGs to strengthen their fund base, improve

negotiation capacity, enhance outreach capability and achieve

greater synergical power. Accordingly, several groups operating

in a village were formed into Isuru Development Societies and

were registered with the Registrar of Companies as a limited

liability society under the Societies Ordinance. By the end of

the year under review, 187 such limited liability societies had

been formed. Four district federations in the project districts

of Matara, Galle, Puttalam and Kandy have been formed by

federating the societies in each district. During the year, Isuru

District Federations have expanded their activities to develop

the economic, social and cultural skills of the members. A

scholarship fund had been established in the Kandy and Matara

districts to provide financial assistance to needy children of

members of Isuru Societies. With a view to providing avenues

to sell the products of the beneficiaries, exhibitions were

organised in the four districts. A programme was also launched

by the Isuru Project to supply local varieties of herbal plants

to Link Natural Products Ltd. and the Ayurveda Pharmaceutical

Corporation by entering into forward sales contracts. The

beneficiaries were also provided with practical training relating

to varieties of herbal plants by the above-mentioned institutions.

The diversification of the activities undertaken by the Isuru

Development Societies is a reflection of the improved capacity

of the Societies that had been established three years ago. The

issued share capital and savings of the Development Societies

amounted to Rs.5.9 million, Rs.7.0 million respectively as at

end of 2000. The loans granted by the societies out of their own

funds stood at Rs.54 million.

Poverty Alleviation Microfinance Project (PAMP)

The Central Bank made preliminary arrangements during the year to commence implementation of the PAMP funded by the Japan Bank for International Co-operation (JBIC).

The Government of Sri Lanka entered into a loan agreement with the JBIC on 4 August 1999 for the implementation of a micro-credit project titled 'Poverty Alleviation Micro Finance Project' (PAMP). This project is a replication of the SFLCP which successfully followed the credit plus approach. The project PAMP aims at setting up an effective credit delivery mechanism for channelling institutional credit for income generating activities to the rural poor who have had no access to credit from formal credit institutions. The project also expects to improve the economic conditions and the general welfare of the beneficiaries and eventually contribute to the economic and social development of Sri Lanka. Six districts viz., Badulla, Nuwara Eliya, Matale, Kalutara, Kurunegala and Hambantota, have been identified for project implementation.

(XXII)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

During the year under review, the Central Bank set up the

Central Project Office and Project District Offices (PDOs) and

also recruited a staff for them.

The total project cost has been estimated at Japanese yen

1,610 million (Rs.870 million) for credit, training, technical

assistance and project administration. The JBIC will provide a

loan of Japanese yen 1,368 million (Rs.739 million), while

Government is required to finance the balance as the local

component of the project costs.

Surathura Programme - Self-Employment Promotion through Micro Enterprise Credit

The three PCIs of the Surathura Programme, Bank of Ceylon (BOC), People's Bank (PB) and Hatton National Bank (HNB), continued the second phase of the programme out of their own funds at an interest rate of 10 per cent per annum. The government continued to pay a 10 per cent interest subsidy to PCIs.

Under Phase II, 30,000 loans to the value of Rs. 1,300 million were targeted for disbursement by the PCIs to eligible borrowers to undertake income generating self-employment projects. The scheme provided loans to unemployed, particularly, educated youth, to enable them to commence new projects or to expand existing projects.

At end 2000, the PCIs had financed 23,000 projects to a value of Rs.907 million. During the year under review, the PCIs had granted Rs.171 million for 3,752 projects.

The Central Bank continued to monitor the recoveries of the Surathura Phase I which completed its operations in 1997. Under this phase, the government allocated a sum of Rs.350 million to provide refinance to PCIs at an interest rate of 4 per cent per annum for a period of 7 years, including a grace period of 5 years. The Surathura Phase I programme had maintained an overall recovery rate of 65 per cent. A fact finding survey conducted by the Rural Credit Department revealed that poor identification of borrowers had resulted in the low rate of recovery of loans under the credit scheme.

Food and Nutrition Promotion Credit Scheme (FANP) The Food and Nutrition Promotion (FANP)

Credit Scheme commenced its operations in 1997 at the request

of the Ministry of Agriculture. The government provided a sum

of Rs.284 million out of the counterpart funds of the Japanese

Food Production grant, received by it for implementation of the

credit scheme. It was designed to channel credit through farmer

organisations, co-operatives and Thrift and Credit Co-operative

Societies. At end 2000, the total sum financed amounted to Rs.25

million. The main reason for under utilisation of credit was the

difficulties encountered by co-operatives and farmer

organisations in providing collateral acceptable to banks as

security for loans. Banks have approved loans amounting to

Rs. 129 million for paddy processing, dairy farming, banana

cultivation and food processing. However, it is likely that the

scheme will remain operative only to finance the loans already

approved.

Kegalle District Integrated Rural Development (Revolving Fund) Project (KGIRDP)

After the conclusion of the Kegalle District Integrated Rural

Development Project (KGIRDP) in 1995, a revolving fund was

established by transferring funds from loan recoveries of the

IRDP. The IRDP revolving credit scheme commenced

operations in 1997, and continued to provide loans to

unemployed educated youth to start up new self-employment

projects or to expand their existing self-employment projects

in the district. For implementation of the Project, Business

Development Officers (BDOs) were engaged on a fee based

system, to identify beneficiaries, to prepare business plans and

to direct the beneficiaries to appropriate banks. The Project had

financed 3,594 sub-projects amounting to Rs.142 million by end

2000. During the year, the three PCIs involved in the Project,

Bank of Ceylon (BOC), People's Bank (PB) and

Sabaragamuwa Development Bank (SDB) had granted loans

amounting to Rs.2 million, Rs.12 million and Rs.29 million,

respectively. The credit delivery mechanism adopted under the

Project has become very successful and, therefore, the activities

of the project are corrected to expand in the future.

Skills Development Project

In December 2000, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka approved the participation of RCD in the Skills Development Project (SDP). The SDP is funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in terms of the loan agreement for the project entered into between the Government and the ADB on 15.11.1999. The ADB will provide a loan of SDR 13.7 million for this project. The Project will be implemented by the Ministry of Vocational Training (MOVT), on behalf of the government, for a period of six years from March 2000 to August 2006.

The objective of the project is to improve the quality and reliance of skills development Programmes with a view to building a high quality workforce through restructuring and reorientation of the vocational training system by introducing competency based training programmes and to promote a closer partnership between vocational training institutions and the private sector. The Project consists of the following four components, i.e., (a) improving the quality and relevance of skills development programmes, (b) institution building and human resource development, (c) resource mobilisation and sustainability and (d) innovative interventions and NGO/private sector participation.

The Central Bank is responsible for implementing the innovative intervention and NGO/private sector participation component by providing refinance to PCIs for eligible sub loans granted to people who have completed the Skills Development Programmes. Preliminary arrangements have been made by the Central Bank to sign the Administration Agreement with the Government and the Subsidiary Loan Agreements with PCIs. The Project is expected to launch a self-employment promotion initiative as a pilot programme for supporting needy people who

(XXIII)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

will be completing Skills Development Programmes. A total

sum of US dollars 657,000 has been allocated for the Project

to provide initial financial support to establish small scale

entrepreneurial or self-employment activities, subject to a

minimum of Rs.50,000 and a maximum of Rs.250,000.

Matale Regional Economic Advancement Project

The Matale Regional Economic Advancement Project funded

by IF AD, which came into effect from 1999, continued its

operations in 2000. This Project is implemented on a trial basis

in the Matale District. Conceptually, this Project is a deviation

from the earlier Integrated Rural Development Project (IRDP)

implemented by the government. Under this new programme,

the private sector will be effectively associated in the project.

This together with infrastructural and credit components the

entrepreneurial abilities available in districts would be

conducive to achieving a sustainable development in the

district. The CBSL functions as the executing agency for the

credit component. The resources of the Matale Regional Office

of the Bank will be used for this purpose. The Kandurata

Development Bank (KDB) has been identified as the main PCI

under the credit component. The IFAD has provided a loan of

SDR 8.35 million to the Government, which includes a credit

component amounting to SDR 2 million, to be utilised for

funding micro and medium scale enterprises, especially in rural

areas in the Matale District. A Project Management Office

under the Regional Development Division of the Ministry of

Plan Implementation has been set up in Matale to assist the

credit component activities. The Bank's Regional Office in

Matale will supervise and monitor the credit component under

the supervision of the Rural Credit Department.

During the year under review, the Central Bank has

entered into an administrative agreement with the Ministry of

Plan Implementation and a subsidiary loan agreement with the

Kandurata Development Bank (KDB) for implementation of the

project.

A summary of the rural credit projects currently being

implemented by the Central Bank is presented in Table 11-13.

Regional Offices

The Monetary Board assigned the responsibility of monitoring

the activities of the Regional Offices (ROs) of the Central Bank

at Matara, Anuradhapura and Matale to the Rural Credit

Department (RCD) in September 2000.

The ROs continued to carry out developmental activities

and traditional central banking activities. Under the

developmental activities, the three ROs have given priority to

promoting the Forward Sales Contract System (FSCS) under

when the buyers and sellers of agricultural produce enter into

forward sales contracts at a pre-determined prices, so that the

farmers could secure a reasonable price for their produce, whilst

buyers obtain good quality produce in time. The three ROs

together with the Regional Development Banks in their

respective areas actively engaged themselves in co-ordinating

this activity. In addition, the ROs were engaged in currency

operations (Matara and Anuradhapura), cheque clearing

activities, data collection, conducting beneficiary training

programmes, assisting regional development projects and

co-ordination with government departments, agencies and

organisations involved in development work in the region.

Matara

The development banking activities of the Matara RO includes

co-ordination of refinance credit schemes, assistance to the

Small Farmers and the Landless Project credit scheme in the

Galle and Matara districts, preliminary activities related to the

Poverty Alleviation Microfinance Project (PAMP) funded by

the Japan Bank for International Co-operation in the

Hambantota District, introduction of FSCS in the region

through the Ruhuna Development Bank (RDB) and other

banks, the Arunalu Village Adoption Programme and the

co-ordination of several rural credit schemes.

Under the research and statistics functions, the office

continued to assist in the islandwide data collection scheme

with weekly data collection in Matara and monthly data

collection in six centres in the Matara District, preparation of

district-wise data and carrying out a survey of small industries

in the Urban Council area in Matara. Other functions performed

by the Matara RO included currency operations, maintenance

of current accounts of commercial banks, operating the regional

clearing house, encouraging sale of government securities

through primary dealers, sale of CBSL publications, conducting

of entrepreneural development programmes, training of officers

of RDBs, educational programmes for students and other

development finance activities relevant to commercial banks

and other agencies.

The Matara RO, made special efforts to introduce the

FSCS in the region jointly with the RDB and the RCD. This

work involved conducting a series of meetings for paddy

farmers and buyers in Weerawila, Lunugamvehera,

Ambalantota, Angunakolapelessa and for sesame farmers in

Suriyawewa, Lunugamvehera and Weeraketiya. The RO

introduced the FSCS programme to commercial bankers in the

area through the Bankers' Forum organised by the Southern

Development Authority. Largely as a result of these efforts, by

the end of the year, as at end, 779 agreements covering a total

value of Rs.49 million for purchase of paddy and sesame were

signed.

The RO continued to assist the RDB in the implementing

the Arunalu Village Adoption Programme in Paravahera and

Angulumaduwa in the Matara and the Hambantota districts

respectively.

With regard to currency operations, a special programme

was launched by the RO to collect coins that has been kept out

of circulation, and three consignments comprising 3,775 bags

of these coins to the value of Rs.3.24 million were sent to the

Currency Department of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. The

regional clearing house operated in the RO, Matara, provided

clearing facilities to 7 commercial banks in the area, facilitating

current account holders to realise the proceeds of cheque

deposits by them. During the year, 209,065 cheques to the value

of Rs.44.8 billion had been cleared through the regional clearing

house.

Matale

The main activities undertaken by the RO, Matale, during the

year under review were promotion of the Forward Sales

Contract System (FSCS) for agricultural produce, conducting

awareness programmes on post-harvest technology, educating

farmers on high-tech agriculture, entrepreneurship

development, development of micro enterprises, village

adoption programmes, marketing development, banking sector

development and rural credit activities. In view of the marketing

difficulties faces by farmers, the RO had given priority to

promoting the FSCS in the region. The first programme was

launched at Morayaya, and activities taken to enter into 312

contracts as at end 2000 with Bank of Ceylon and the

Kandurata Development Bank (KDB) acting as facilitators. The

RO also provide training and conducted workshops and

seminars to improve the skills of farmers.

During the year, the RO selected a colony in Dullewa in

the Matale District for development under the village adoption

programme. The RO also initiated the establishment of two

organisations in Matale and Kandy for bankers in the area to

discuss common problems with a view to developing good

harmony among them.

During 2000, the RO continued the activities relating to

the credit schemes on Food and Nutrition Promotion, Tea Small

Holder Development, Second Perennial Crop Development

Project, Urban Environment and Infrastructural Development

Project, Kegalle District IRD Project (Credit Monitoring

Committee Activities), Small Farmers and the Landless Credit

Project, Regional Economic Advancement Project and the

Interest Subsidy Scheme for Agriculture.

The RO also continued operating two clearing houses in

Kandy and Matale. The Kandy clearing house handled 811,533

cheques to the value of Rs.23.1 billion of two State Banks and

nine private commercial banks, while the Matale clearing house

handled 113,433 cheques to the value of Rs.2.1 billion.

Anuradhapura

The main activities carried out by the Regional Office, Anuradhapura were micro enterprise development, development of cultivation systems, forward sales contracts, loan disbursements under the ADB funded Rural Development Project (ADB-RDP) and the IFAD funded Participatory Rural Development Project (IFAD-PRDP), conducting educational seminars, data collection, sales of central bank publications, currency operations and the regional clearing house.

Under micro enterprise development activities, the Regional Office (RO) had conducted three entrepreneurship development programmes for youths in the Anuradhapura

District, training them in a variety of areas such as food

processing, procurement of raw materials, banking and financial

assistance and maintenance of quality control, to help them to

start self-employment projects.

With a view to uplifting the living standards of the rural

poor and upgrading their skills, the RO conducted several

training programmes/workshops for targeted groups. Through

the development of cultivation systems programme, the

farmers/cultivators in the region were made aware of latest

farming techniques, irrigation systems, methods of minimising

waste and maintaining high quality of products.

During 2000, the RO, in collaboration with the banks

operating in the area, took the initiative to promote the FSCS

in the area. As a result, the RO was able to initiate 963 forward

sales agreements to a total value of Rs.35 million.

In addition, the RO carried out currency operations,

regional clearing and selling of Central Bank publications in

the area.

Financial Markets

The Central Bank, through its Financial Markets Department

(FMD), assists in creating a conducive policy environment for

the development of financial markets in Sri Lanka, with

emphasis on the debt securities market. The functions of the

Department involve identifying appropriate incentives,

institutional support requirements and improving operating and

regulatory structures for the proper and efficient functioning

of the financial markets. The FMD is also responsible for

coordinating and monitoring the implementation of the

on-going financial sector reforms programme and for

co-ordinating the activities of the Financial Sector Reform

Committee, which is responsible for reforms in the financial

sector. The Department also liaises with international donor

agencies on technical assistance projects for the Central Bank

relating to the financial sector.

During the year under review, the Department was

engaged in co-ordinating a number of activities. Some of them

are set out below.

Deposit Insurance Scheme

The Central Bank appointed a Task Force to explore the

feasibility of setting up a compulsory deposit insurance scheme,

covering banks and finance companies. The main objective of

the proposed scheme is to protect small depositors and to level

the operating conditions between the state banks and the private

banks.

The Task Force is expected to give recommendations on:

(a) The scope and level of deposit insurance coverage (b) The institutional structure and administration

(c) The cost of funding and ownership

(d) The type of premium rates and policies for addressing depositor claims

(XXVI)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

(e) The outline of the proposed legislation required to set

up and administer the deposit insurance scheme.

Legislative Enactments and Proposed Legislation

(a) Regulations relating to Primary Dealers under the Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance and the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance

New regulations governing the licensing, operating and

supervisory framework of primary dealers were gazetted in

March 2000. This allowed dealers to set up separate entities

with dedicated capital to trade exclusively in Treasury

securities. Eight primary dealers have been registered under the

new scheme.

(b) Insurance Act

The Regulation of Insurance Industry Act, No.43 of 2000 was

passed by Parliament in July 2000.

This Act provides for the establishment of a regulatory

authority for the insurance sector. The insurance regulatory

body will be responsible for supervising the operating

environment of insurance companies, insurance broking

companies and agents. The minimum share capital and

prudential requirements, such as solvency margins and reserves

for insurance companies, are specified in the law.

The new Act also provides for greater diversification of

the investment portfolio of insurance companies by reducing

the minimum stipulated level of investment in government

securities. The qualifications of the directors and key staff in

the insurance and broking companies are specified in the law.

There are also requirements relating to actuarial valuations and

audited accounts. This Act replaced the Control of Insurance

Act, No.25 of 1962.

(c) Finance Leasing Act

The new Finance Leasing Law was passed by Parliament in

August 2000 and will become operative in early 2001. The

Finance Leasing Law defines the rights and obligations of

parties to a finance leasing transaction and provides a regulatory

and supervisory framework for the finance leasing industry. The

CBSL will license, regulate and supervise finance leasing

companies.

Preparation of Draft Bills and Regulations

The FMD was also associated in the preparation of several draft

bills and regulations during the year. The bills are expected to

be finalised and presented to Parliament in 2001.

The following are the draft bills and regulations:

(a) Draft Bill for a Superannuation Benefit Fund Regulatory Commission

The Draft Bill for a Superannuation Benefit Fund

Regulatory Commission was approved by the Cabinet in May

2000. This move was taken to facilitate the establishment of a

regulatory authority for private pension and provident funds.

(b) Draft Bill to amend the Banking Act, No. 30 of 1988

Amendments to the Banking Act were approved by the

Monetary Board in February 2000, and Cabinet approved the

Bill in April 2000.

These amendments would strengthen the supervisory and

regulatory powers of the Central Bank relating to licensing

procedures, revocation of licences, amalgamation, liquidation

and closure of banks, qualifications, appointment and removal

of bank directors and senior management. They also provide

for the establishment of a regulatory framework for 'Registered

Financial Institutions' which is a category of institutions

engaged in financial business, other than deposit taking.

(c) Draft Bill to amend the Monetary Law Act, No. 58 of 1949

The proposed amendments to the Monetary Law Act relate to:

I Making price stability the main objective of the CBSL so

as to avoid possible policy conflicts.

I Revising the definition of money supply to take in to

account 'broad money'.

I Removal of the maximum and the minimum limits on the

statutory reserve ratios.

) Providing more flexibility to the Monetary Board to decide

the basis of computation of the required reserves.

I Payment of interest on reserves, and

> Enabling the imposition of reserve requirements on

financial liabilities other than deposit liabilities.

Tax incentives for the development of capital markets

A series of tax incentives had been granted during the past few years to develop the equity and debt markets and to increase the array of financial instruments available in Sri Lanka.

During 2000, the stamp duty for mortgages and asset backed securities was removed with a view to promoting the diversification of financial instruments and creating an environment conducive to financial innovation.

The Agreements between the Government of Sri Lanka and the State owned Commercial Banks

The main objectives of the Agreements signed by the Bank of Ceylon and People's Bank with the Government of Sri Lanka on 16 July 1998, were to improve the banks' profitability, efficiency and financial soundness by commercialising and consolidating operations, increasing productivity, reducing costs, rationalising staff levels and the branch network, conserving assets, increasing loan recoveries and improving risk management. These objectives sought to improve the banks' internal governance and financial performance, by providing

(XXVII)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

the management with operating autonomy and specifying

annual quantitative performance targets. Profitability targets

included return on assets and return on capital, efficiency targets

and financial soundness targets for loan recovery and

non-performing loans.

The Central Bank continued to monitor the performance of the

Banks to achieve these targets set out in the Agreement.

Technical Assistance Projects

The FMD co-ordinated the implementation of the following

technical assistance projects with various donor agencies during

the year.

(a) Automation of the Central Bank Payments System and the Government Debt Securities Market

An in-house Central Depository System for scripless

treasury bills and treasury bonds has been developed

during the year. The preliminary work connected with the

implementation of the Real Time Gross Settlement System

will commence in 2001 under the proposed World Bank

technical assistance programme.

(b) Surveillance of Primary Dealers

The Central Bank has prepared a new legal framework for the supervision of primary dealers. With technical assistance from the World Bank, manuals and guidelines required for effective supervision of the primary dealer system were prepared during the year and staff have been provided with training. Both on-site examinations and off-site surveillance commenced during the year.

(c) Upgrading the supervisory capabilities of the Bank Supervision Department

The project involves upgrading the on-site and off-site supervisory capacity of the Department in risk based supervision and computer audits. The second phase of the technical assistance under SIDA was in progress.

(d) Pension Reform Project

Technical assistance has been obtained to engage consultants to assist in introducing pension reforms. This assistance is in the area of:

I Establishing a regulatory authority for insurance and

private superannuation funds and I Making proposals for reforming pension and provident

fund systems and developing a comprehensive and sustainable social security system.

Research Activities

The Economic Research Department (ERD) assisted the Governor and the Monetary Board in the conduct of monetary policy and in the performance of the Central Bank's role as economic adviser to the government. ERD collected and

analysed statistical and other information on the Sri Lanka economy as well as on the trends and recent developments in the world economy and undertook research on related subjects. It improved and enhanced the supply of economic information to the public, that being one of the major responsibilities of the Central Bank.

ERD also co-ordinated Sri Lanka's relations with the IMF and the Intergovernmental Group of Twenty Four (G-24) on International Monetary Affairs, while also helping the Ministry of Finance and planning to co-ordinate its functions with other international organisations, such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other multilateral and bilateral donors. It also provided technical support in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Internal and International Trade and Commerce in the area of some of the international relations. In addition, the ERD provided policy advice/observations on various matters referred to the Department by other departments of the Bank as well as the Ministry of Finance.

The services of research officers in the Department were made available for training of postgraduate degree aspirants of the Bank and for providing guidance in their research. Its officers also served as resource persons in training programmes conducted by the Centre for Banking Studies and other foreign and local organisations.

The ERD continued to compile the weekly and monthly economic indicators and made these available to the public through the Internet and other media. The Department compiles the Sri Lanka Inter Bank Offer Rates (SLIBOR) that give an indication of the likely rates for rupee transactions among commercial banks for different maturities. The coverage of the SLIBOR was expanded to include three, six and twelve month offer rates, as against the earlier coverage of only three maturities, viz. overnight, seven days and one month. In 2000, Sri Lanka became a member of the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) of the IMF. The Department was also involved in the preparation of Meta Data to subscribe to the GDDS.

The Department contributed to and co-ordinated the publication of the 1999 Annual Report of the Central Bank in collaboration with other departments of the Bank. In addition, the September 15th Report, a report prepared under Section 116 of the Monetary Law Act, was completed and submitted to the

Hon. Minister of Finance. Similarly, the Department published 'Sri Lanka Economy in 1999 and Medium Term Prospects' and the 'State of the Economy 2000'. The Department also prepared several special policy reports as required under the Monetary Law Act.

The publication of a monthly private sector industrial production index, based on a sample survey of 100 major industrial firms, continued. The detailed half-yearly and annual private sector industrial production surveys were also continued. A quarterly index of 'Greater Colombo Housing Approvals' was prepared and publication commenced in 2000. A special survey was conducted on local government budgets with a view to analysing their share in the general government fiscal activities.

(XXVIII)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

Officers of ERD undertook a number of research studies. These included policy oriented research as well as studies which are largely of academic interest, covering macro and microeconomic issues. Some of these were published in the 'Staff Studies' of the Central Bank.

The monetary implications of various foreign loan agreements to be entered into between the Government of Sri Lanka and donors were examined by the Department and a number of Board Papers were submitted to the Monetary Board advising on these.

Some of the senior officers of ERD served on several important committees, both within the Bank and outside. These included the Inter Ministerial Sub Committee on the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and the Sub Committee on Anti Dumping and Countervailing Duties, the Committee on Master Plan for Industrialisation and Investment Promotion, the Balance of Payments Committee, the Exchange Rate Committee, the Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds Tender Committees, the Liquidity Assessment Committee, the Open Market Operations Committee and the Domestic Debt Management Committee. Officers of the Department represented the Central Bank in the Core Group on Taxation of the Ministry of Finance and Planning, which reviews the current tax system and makes proposals for a medium term tax strategy of the government.

The Department initiated consultations with the Riksbank of Sweden to develop a macroeconomic model that could be effectively used for implementing monetary policy.

The Central Bank hosted the 23rd SEANZA Central Banking Course and the SEANZA Governors' Symposium in 2000. The South East Asia, New Zealand and Australia (SEANZA) grouping of central banks is one of the oldest in the region, having been set up in the 1950s. At present, it consists of 20 members, both developed economies and developing economies. Sri Lanka is a founder member. SEANZA has been conducting a training course in central banking every two years since 1957. Sri Lanka last hosted the Course in 1968. There were 19 participants from 18 countries (13 SEANZA and 5 non-SEANZA members) who attended the Course in 2000.

Governors from SEANZA countries also meet at a Symposium, usually held at the end of the Central Banking course. The Symposium in 2000 was held in August and was a part of the Central Bank's Golden Jubilee celebrations. The theme of this Symposium was 'Central Bank Independence'. The keynote speaker was the Right Honourable Sir Edward George GBE, Governor of the Bank of England. Delegations from 15 SEANZA member central banks and monetary authorities participated at the Symposium. A special guest at the Symposium was a deputy governor from Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden, the world's oldest central bank.

The SAARC FINANCE cell, established in the Department, co-ordinated the activities of the Network of SAARC Central Bank Governors and Finance Secretaries.

Statistics and Field Surveys

The Statistics Department (SD) continued to discharge its

obligations in the collection, compilation, analysis and

dissemination of (a) data on national accounts, prices, wages,

labour force, employment and other socio-economic indicators

and (b) micro level data on households and the corporate sector.

The SD continued to compile and disseminate national

accounts estimates on a quarterly and an annual basis. During

2000, it focussed on identifying statistically deficient areas of

economic activities, with a view to improving the quality of

available information for the compilation of national accounts.

In obtaining market information pertaining to price data and

price movements, the SD continued its collection of wholesale

and retail prices of food commodities in key market centres.

The frequency of collecting retail prices in some markets was

increased from a weekly to a daily basis. The release of daily,

weekly and monthly information on prices to the print and

electronic media, as well as to relevant institutions, continued.

At the same time, the dissemination of market information on

prices was expanded.

In the field of household surveys, the Department

undertook two experimental surveys in late 2000. One was in

the Anuradhapura District to obtain production data on 'other'

agricultural crops and livestock farming. The other was on

small business activities in the Colombo District. Both these

surveys were conducted with a view to improving the quality

of production estimates in these two specific sectors towards

strengthening the existing database on national income

accounts.

Meanwhile, the Department commenced preliminary

planning work in 2000 to conduct the eighth Consumer

Finances and Socio Economic Survey during 2001/02. The

Department also initiated action to release micro data from the

seventh Consumer Finances and Socio Economic Survey to

potential users, solely for research purposes.

Surveys

Survey on Subsidiary Food Crops and Animal Husbandry in the Anuradhapura District - Yala 2000

The first experimental survey conducted by the Department to

strengthen the database on national income accounts was on

Subsidiary Food Crops and Animal Husbandry in the

Anuradhapura District in the 2000 Yala season. A second

objective in conducting this survey was to enhance the

information provided by the Department of Census and

Statistics (DCS), which is the official source of national

information for agriculture food crops and livestock farming.

Considering the urgent need to address these two objectives,

the responsibility for conducting this survey on an experimental

basis in the Anuradhapura District was entrusted to the Statistics

Department of the Central Bank.

( X X I X )

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

The information collected through the survey included the

quantity and value of production and extent of area under

cultivation of subsidiary food crops, as well as data on livestock

population and livestock products at household level. Field

work of the survey was conducted from end October to end

November 2000. The data collection for the survey was done

by unemployed graduates hired from the area through the

Anuradhapura Regional Office under the Departments'

supervision. The field supervision was undertaken by Central

Bank officers. Data entry and editing were completed by end

December 2000 and the survey findings are expected to be

published in early 2001.

Small Business Pilot Survey

This was the second experimental survey conducted by the

Department. The objective was again to strengthen the database

for this sector in the estimating of the national income accounts.

The Department undertook this survey with a view to

developing a standard reporting system to obtain regular

information to identify the contribution of this sector to the

national economy. The small business sector mainly covers

establishments which provide business, social, personal,

household and other miscellaneous services to the surrounding

community including hotels, restaurants and small scale

manufacturing units.

The Department conducted the pilot survey initially in one

Grama Niladari (GN) Division of the Colombo District, on an

experimental basis. Prior to conducting the pilot survey, a

listing exercise was undertaken to identify all small business

units in the GN division. The data collection was outsourced

to teachers and students who were trained for the purpose by

the Department. The Department completed the preliminary

data processing work of the survey in 2000. The quality and

reliability of data gathered will be analysed to evaluate the

feasibility of employing students and staff drawn from schools

as investigators for future surveys of this kind.

Country Wide Data Collection System (CWDCS)

The Country Wide Data Collection System of the Statistics Department, which commenced in 1978, completed 22 years of operation in 2000. Regular collection of information on retail prices of consumer goods, producer prices of agricultural commodities and wage rates pertaining to the informal sector is carried out under this programme. The system is also used to identify the impact of changes in the administered prices of consumer items as well as to monitor the performance of agriculture in major producing areas. The sub sectors covered by the scheme include paddy, tea, rubber, coconut cultivation and small-scale construction. Data collection is accomplished through an islandwide network of school teachers who function as statistical investigators. Information thus collected is published regularly through the print and electronic media. Seminars were conducted in Colombo, Kandy and Anuradhapura in 2000 to provide further training for the data

collectors in order to improve the quality and efficiency of their

data collection as well as to obtain their input in the

computation of regional consumer price indices.

The daily collection of wholesale and retail prices of major

food items from the Pettah Market and other centres such as

the Maradagahamula rice market and the Dambulla Economic

Centre is also done by the Department. This information is

disseminated daily in the newspapers and through the electronic

media to farmers, traders and consumers. The information is

also used by government agencies and private sector institutions

for research and business decision making such as in forward

sales contracts.

Computation of Price Indices

Consumer Price Indices

The Colombo District Consumer Price Index (CDCPI),

introduced in 1998, continued to be computed by the

Department as a supplementary index to the Colombo

Consumers' Price Index (CCPI) computed by the DCS. The

target population used in this index is the lowest 40 per cent

of the district population ranked by income. It has a broader

coverage in terms of the number of items, as well as

geographically, than the CCPI. The information for the

computation of the index is obtained from 11 centres in the

Colombo District. Of these 11 centres, 5 centres, namely, the

Pettah Market, Hanwella, Homagama, Moratuwa and

Avissawella, are established under the CWDCS and other

centres namely, Kolonnawa, Nugegoda, Dehiwala, Piliyandala,

Maharagama and Padukka, were newly introduced in January

1999. Officers of the Statistics Department and appointed

teacher investigators collected information regularly from these

centres.

Since 1998, the Department has computed three regional

consumer price indices for the districts of Anuradhapura,

Matara and Matale on an experimental basis. The commodity

weights for the indices are based on the expenditure patterns

of the respective districts derived from the Consumer Finances

and Socio-Economic Survey of 1996/97 conducted by the

Central Bank. The corresponding weights for the calculation

of the indices were constructed, based on the target population

of the lowest 40 per cent of households in the district, when

ranked by income. These indices are useful in analysing

regional price movements. They are also used by market players

in negotiating forward sales contracts in agricultural

commodities.

The Statistics Department continued to develop a new

consumer price index covering the Western Province. This is

still at an experimental stage. This has a wider coverage than

the CDCPI both geographically and in terms of income. The

main improvement expected from this index is expanded

coverage of a consumer price index to higher income

households as well. This index represents households in the

Western Province, which are below the islandwide cut off for

( X X X )

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

the average monthly income level of the lowest 80 per cent

ranked by income, taken from the Consumer Finances and

Socio Economic Survey of 1996/97. The weights are based on

the expenditure pattern of the representative households. Data

collection centres have been extended beyond major trading

centres used for the CDCPI to include super markets in the city

to capture changing consumption patterns of the higher income

households as well.

Wholesale Price Index

The Department continues to compute the Wholesale Price

Index (WPI) which reflects the price movements at the primary

market level. This is useful as an indicator of the future price

movements in retail markets.

National Accounts

The Department continued its activities in connection with the

estimation of national accounts. These included the collection

and compilation of primary and secondary data. In 2000, the

Department endeavoured to strength estimation procedures of

national accounts, in general, giving wider coverage to informal

and emerging economic activities. As mentioned earlier, the

Department conducted two experimental surveys on domestic

agriculture and small business to strengthen the prevailing

database for these activities.

Meanwhile, steps were taken to enhance public awareness

on current trends in national accounts through issuing press

releases and organising press conferences. Also, available

information was disseminated through the Central Bank

web-site. Timely dissemination of quarterly national accounts

data also enhanced public interest in the subject.

Provincial National Accounts

The Department completed compilation of provincial Gross Domestic Product estimates (GDP) on an experimental basis for the period from 1996 to 1998. The estimates of provincial GDP were compiled on the basis of current factor cost prices. These benchmark estimates provide a comprehensive database on provincial economic activities, thus enabling measurement of the contribution from the different provinces to national economic development.

Employment Statistics

The annual Survey of Public Sector Employment was

conducted in 2000 as well, with the objective of ascertaining

the trends in employment in government ministries,

departments, provincial councils, local authorities, corporations

and state boards.

Networking and Web Page Development

In 2000, the Statistics Department established a networking facility, thereby integrating most of its computers to the network system of the Bank. This integrated system provided access to

and sharing of databases between divisions and other

departments of the Bank, thereby ensuring speedy and efficient

transfer of data and information. A Statistics Department web

page 'STANET' was also developed to provide access to data

and press releases of the Department as well as to provide

general information about the work of the Department to all

departments connected to the local area network of the Central

Bank.

Publications

Consumer Finances and Socio Economic Survey 1996/97

Part II of the report of the seventh Consumer Finances and

Socio Economic Survey conducted in 1996/97 was published

in 2000. Part I of the report, which was published in 1999,

contained an in-depth analysis of data, while Part II presents a

compendium of 514 detailed statistical tables. The data

presented in this report are sample data and not estimates for

population totals.

Part II comprises 6 chapters, namely; (1) Demographic and

Socio Economic Conditions (2) Labour Force, Employment and

Unemployment (3) Income (4) Expenditure and Consumption

(5) Loans and Investments and (6) Provincial Data. These micro

level household data are particularly useful for decision makers,

policy planners and researchers, both in the private and public

sectors. In disseminating survey information to a wider cross

section of users during the year, the Department acceded to

requests made by both public and private sector institutions to

provide specially tabulated data. In addition to Part II, the

Department initiated action to prepare a single CD ROM

incorporating Part I of the report and the statistical tables

published in Part II of the report.

Other Publications

During the period under review, the Department continued working on two annual publications. The Department released 'Sri Lanka Socio-Economic Data 2000 - Volume XXIII' in June 2000, while work on the publication 'Economic and Social Statistics of Sri Lanka 2000 - Volume XXII' was reaching completion by end - 2000.

These two publications carry comprehensive time series and cross-sectional data on socio- economic variables, including demography, labour force and employment, national income and expenditure, agriculture, industry, external trade and finance, prices and wages, money and banking, capital markets, government finance and socio-economic services. Data dissemination in the publication 'Economic and Social Statistics of Sri Lanka 2000' was improved further by providing province-wise information with a wider coverage. In addition, the Department contributed to several other publications of the Central Bank during the year.

Employees' Provident Fund

The Monetary Board continued to perform its functions as the

custodian of the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) during 2000

in close collaboration with the EPF Division of the Department

of Labour. In terms of the EPF Act, the functions of the

Monetary Board in relation to the Fund, consist of receiving

contributions, surcharges and income from investments,

maintaining proper accounts of registered employments and

members of the Fund, investing excess monies in suitable

investments and paying benefits to the members of the Fund.

The modernisation of the investment process and other

operations of the EPF was further continued during the year.

Special projects were undertaken to continue the progressive

automation of the EPF system with the assistance from the

Information Technology Department of the Bank. Automation

in areas of refund payments, member account amalgamation

and processing of housing loan applications was further

developed, bringing more accuracy, efficiency and improved

customer service.

Streamlining of the Investment Process

Eight Fund Managers who had successfully completed a

training program conducted by the EPF with financial

assistance from the World Bank, were recruited by the EPF in

the fourth quarter of 2000. The improved in-house fund

management capacity has facilitated the Fund to move towards

a progressive diversification of the investment portfolio by

more investments in market oriented instruments.

Investment Activities

The diversification of the portfolio into market based securities

was continued during the period under review. The total

Government Rupee loan investments amounted to 73 per cent

of the total investment portfolio at the end of 2000, against 81

per cent as at the end of 1999. This drop was compensated by

an increase in investments in Treasury bonds from 15 per cent

in 1999 to 22 per cent in 2000.

period under review. The equity portfolio as a percentage of

the total portfolio increased to 0.5 per cent at end 2000 as

compared to 0.3 per cent recorded at the end of the previous

year. These investments were made after carrying out in-depth

analyses, which enabled the EPF to possess an equity portfolio

with the potential of high returns at an acceptable level of risk.

The equity portfolio yielded a rate of return of 37 per cent

during 2000.

Secondary Market Trading

The EPF continued its participation in the secondary market

activities in Treasury bonds and Treasury bills during 2000. The

secondary market activities enabled the EPF to enhance the

realisable rate of return on Treasury bonds and Treasury bills.

Table 11-15 below gives the details of the secondary market

operations of the EPF during the year under review.

Exchange Control

In 2000, the Exchange Control Department (ECD) took several

policy measures consistent with the objective of continuing the

process of sequential liberalisation of the capital account.

Concurrently, the Department also strengthened its monitoring

activities relating to foreign exchange transactions with a view

to avoiding exchange malpractices and abuses. It also continued

investigations into contraventions of the Exchange Control Act,

the registration of freight forwarders and grant and renewal of

permits of travel agents and money changers.

A major development during the year with regard to the

liberalisation of capital account transactions was an increase

in the limits imposed for investment by non residents in the

banking, insurance, and stock brokering sectors and in Unit

Trusts.

Another noteworthy feature during the year was that

permission granted to banks to lend to non resident controlled

companies in 1999 was extended to apply to companies

approved under Section 17 of the BOI Act as well, subject to

prudential limits on each bank's total lending to such

companies. In the area of foreign currency loans, permission

was granted to the National Development Bank and the DFCC

Bank to lend in foreign currency to exporters, provided that the

two banks have the resources to do so with foreign currency

credit lines. Further, in the case of default of foreign currency

loans given by banks, the banks were informed that they could

apply to the Controller of Exchange for the conversion of rupee

sales proceeds of mortgaged assets into foreign currency and

each application would be decided on its merits.

In the area of electronic fund transfer cards (EFTCs),

permission was given to issue such cards to holders of Non

Resident Foreign Currency Accounts (NRFC), Resident

Foreign Currency Accounts (RFC), Resident Non National

Foreign Currency Accounts (RNNFC) and accounts in Foreign

Currency Banking Units (FCBUs) irrespective of whether the

applicant is a resident or non resident. The implementation of

the monitoring scheme for foreign exchange drawings through

EFTCs, although introduced in 1999, commenced in July 2000

as the concerned banks had to adjust their computer systems

to provide the information required by the Controller of

Exchange.

Capital Transactions

(a) Non-resident Investment in Sri Lanka

With effect from March 2000, the limits imposed on non resident investment in the banking, insurance and stock brokering industry were relaxed. With the relaxation non-resident investment in shares in a banking institution was permitted up to 60 per cent; the earlier stipulated limit was 49 per cent. The limit with respect to companies engaged in insurance business was specified as 90 per cent. In companies engaged in stock brokering, the limit was to 49 per cent, but

where permission was granted by the Securities Exchange

Commission, allowed upto 100 per cent. The limits with respect

to other financial sector activities continued to be 49 per cent.

Further non residents were permitted to invest Unit Trusts

registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission,

subject to the condition that the Trust Deed creating the Unit

Trust and agreement between the Trustees and the Managing

Company contains a restriction that not more than 20 per cent

of the deposited property is to be invested in government

securities. These changes were introduced by a notification

published in the Government Gazette No.: 1122/12 of 7 March

2000. Subject to these changes the terms and conditions for

investments by non residents in local companies remained as

before.

(b) Rupee Lending to Non-resident Controlled Companies

In 1999 permission was granted to all banks licensed under the

Banking Act to extend accommodation including, loans and

advances, to Sri Lanka companies with a majority non-resident

share holding, other than companies approved under Section

17 of the BOI Act. With effect from April 2000, banks were

permitted to lend non resident controlled companies approved

under Section 17 of the BOI Act as well, subject to prudential

limits imposed on each bank as a percentage of its total lending

to the private sector. The applicable percentages were the

following:

Foreign Banks - No limit

State Banks - 2 per cent of total lending to

the private sector

Domestic Private Banks - 3 per cent of total lending to

the private sector

Licensed Specialised Banks - 5 per cent of total lending to

the private sector

These facilities were provided particularly with a view to assisting BOI companies engaged in large scale infrastructure projects, whose earning are exclusively in Sri Lanka rupees. The prudential limits were imposed mainly to avoid crowding out of domestic borowing.

(c) Foreign Currency Borrowing by Residents

With effect from April 2000, the Licensed Specialised Banks,

NDB and DFCC Bank were permitted to extend foreign

currency loans to exporters, provided that they had resources

from foreign currency credit lines to do so.

Another development in this area was that all Authorised

Dealers were informed that, in cases of default of foreign

currency loans secured by the mortgage of domestic assets, they

could apply to the Controller of Exchange for permission to

convert the sale proceeds of such assets to foreign exchange.

However, such applications would be considered only if the

Controller of Exchange were satisfied that every endeavour had

been taken to recover the loan in foreign exchange and failing

(XXXIII)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

that, to sell the mortgaged assets for a consideration in foreign

exchange. The order covering off-shore banking business was

also amended during the year to incorporate permission given

to offshore units to provide foreign currency accommodation

to direct and indirect exporters of goods and services.

(d) Borrowing from Abroad by Resident Companies

The ECD continued to consider applications by companies,

other than companies approved under Section 17 of the BOI

Act with full exemption from the provisions of the Exchange

Control Act, to obtain foreign currency loans from abroad. Only

a few applications under this category were approved during

the year. The total value of these loans amounted to US dollars

3.2 million approximately.

(e) Blocked Funds Held by Sri Lankan Emigrants and Foreign Nationals

Funds realised on the sale of capital assets belonging to Sri

Lankan emigrants continued to be kept in blocked accounts,

while the interest earned on such accounts were permitted to

be remitted after meeting tax liabilities, if any. As in the past,

release of such funds was permitted through commercial banks,

subject to a limit of Rs.750,000 per individual and Rs.l million

per family unit. A sum of Rs.30 million had been remitted

abroad in respect of 126 applications received from those

migrating abroad during the year. A sum of Rs.753,765 was

also remitted during the year, to beneficiaries of deceased

persons living abroad. A sum of Rs.4 million out of funds

realised by the sale of immovable property by Sri Lankan

emigrants was also remitted abroad during the year.

2. Registration of Freight Forwarders and Issue of Permits to Engage in Foreign Exchange Transactions

ECD continued to register freight forwarders, permit travel

agencies to issue travellers' cheques, and issue/renew licenses

to money changers and to other establishments such as hotels,

duty free shops, travel agents and service providers to accept

foreign currency with respect to sales and services provided by

them to foreign tourists.

(a) Registration of Freight Forwarders

During 2000, five new companies were registered as freight forwarders bringing the total number of companies registered as freight forwarders to 93 as at the end of the year. The ECD continued to monitor the activities of freight forwarders registered with the department.

(b) Authority for Travel Agents to issue Travellers' Cheques

During the year, a permit was issued to one travel agent

authorising issue of travellers' cheques (TCs) to residents of

Sri Lanka who travel abroad. With this the number of travel

agents permitted to issue TCs increased to 7 in 2000.

(c) Appointment of Money Changers

During the year, the performance of the 30 money changers

issued with permits was closely monitored. Permits of 2 money

changers were not renewed on account of poor performance.

However, permits were issued to 2 new money changers and

the number of money changers with valid permits remained at

30 as at end of 2000.

3. Monitoring

Consequent on the liberalisation of current account transactions,

Authorised Dealers (AD) and approved travel agents were

permitted to release foreign exchange without any restriction

for current account transactions, exercising their judgement and

discretion and after satisfying themselves of the bona fides of

the requests.

All ADs and approved travel agents are required to report

to the ECD the sales and purchases of foreign exchange effected

by them on a regular basis to enable the Department to monitor

the transactions. From 1999, ADs were also required to report

releases of foreign exchange on electronic fund transfer card

(EFTC) transactions. In particular, they were required to furnish

a monthly statement on all EFTC transactions where the

monthly remittances in respect of a EFTC exceeded US dollars

5,000 or its equivalent foreign currency. However, as there was

a need to adjust computer systems in banks to conform to this,

the reporting requirement became fully effective only in July

2000. Until then ADs were required to report only payments/

drawings on single transactions exceeding US dollars 3,000.

The ECD has been monitoring these transactions to ascertain

whether the payments relate to purchases of goods in

commercial quantities or for capital transactions which are not

permitted to be made through EFTCs.

The ECD continued to monitor payments made in advance

for imports in order to ensure the receipts of goods and services

in the country against such advance payments. Credits and

debits made to rupee accounts maintained by shipping and

airline agents as well as freight forwarders on behalf of foreign

principals continued to be monitored. Capital transfers made

through Share Investment External Rupee Accounts (SIERA)

were also monitored.

4. Investigation

The ECD continued to investigate alleged violations of the Exchange Control Act. Some investigations were concluded in 2000 and penalties under the Act were imposed on offenders. A total sum of Rs.25 million, paid as penalties in 1999 and 2000 was transferred to the account of the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury during the year.

(XXXIV)

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

Public Debt

In terms of Section 113 of the Monetary Law Act, the Central

Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) is entrusted with the issuance,

management and servicing of domestic debt and servicing of

foreign debt of the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL). These

activities are handled by the Public Debt Department (PDD)

of the CBSL. In fulfilling its responsibilities, the PDD

continued to issue domestic debt instruments, namely Rupee

securities (RSs), Treasury bills and Treasury bonds during

2000. In addition, servicing of the external debt of the

government is also handled by the PDD. The PDD also handles

issuance and servicing of Central Bank securities (CBSs).

However, there were no CBS issues during 2000. The other

activities of the PDD include service payments of Tax Reserve

Certificates (TRCs) and debenture issues on behalf of the State

Mortgage and Investment Bank (SMIB), the National Housing

Development Authority (NHDA) and the Urban Development

Authority (UDA). The PDD is also responsible for the off-site

surveillance and on-site examination of Primary Dealer (PD)

activities and for developing the government debt securities

market.

Development Activities

During 2000, the PDD implemented several measures to further

develop the domestic debt securities market. The PDD

continued with activities relating to the introduction of the

proposed scripless securities system (SSS) with a view to

developing the market for government debt securities. The

software for SSS was developed by the Bank's Information

Technology Department (ITD). It is expected that the proposed

SSS would initially facilitate transactions in government

securities, namely outright sales and purchases, repurchases and

reverse repurchases among PDs.

With the objective of strengthening the Primary Dealer

System (PDS), 8 public limited liability companies with a

dedicated capital of Rs.150 million each were appointed as PDs

with effect from 01 March 2000. The new PDs were appointed

in terms of the Regulations promulgated by the Minister of

Finance and Planning under the provisions of the Registered

Stock and Securities Ordinance (RSSO) and the Local Treasury

Bills Ordinance (LTBO). These companies are required to

engage exclusively in PD activities, viz. trading in government

debt securities. With the above Regulations coming into force,

the PDs who functioned upto then ceased operations. The

Regulations, inter alia, provided for the CBSL to supervise and

examine the activities of the PDs in order to ensure that PDs

operate in an efficient, safe and sound manner.

The PDD obtained the services of a consultant to design

a framework and a system for PD surveillance. The consultants

reviewed the existing legal and regulatory framework relating

to PD operations and the directives issued to date by the PDD.

The consultants made recommendations with respect to

modifications and additions required to the existing regulations

and guidelines. Key recommendations made by them include

the introduction of an electronic bidding system for Treasury

bond auctions to increase clarity and transparency to adopt the

Global Master Repurchase Agreement and to develop and

introduce a more rigorous process for the licensing of PDs.

The consultants also prepared two Operations Manuals,

i.e., one for the PDD and the other for the PDs. The PDD

Operations Manual contains on-site examination questionnaires

covering different activities under different risk categories. This

manual also provides details of conducting an on-site

supervision exercise. The consultants have used a risk based

approach to supervision which focuses on evaluating the PD's

ability to properly identify, manage and control risks in an

effective, efficient and timely manner. Thus, the overall

approach of the Supervision Unit is to systematically identify

the risk profile of each PD and assess the adequacy of the

management, organisation and systems to monitor and control

the risks inherent in its operations.

The PD Operations Manual contains all reports required

by the PDD as a part of off-site surveillance along with detailed

instructions for report preparation and submission. With the

objective of assisting the establishment of a safe and sound PD

network, this manual also provides guidance to PDs in the

development and introduction of international best practices

with respect to government securities trading, overall PD

management, organisation and operations. The manual will also

guide the PDD on-site surveillance and off-site supervision, and

each PD will be evaluated in terms of the extent to which the

principles and best practices set forth in the manual are being

complied with.

Two year Treasury bonds with a call option were issued

by the PDD for the first time in 2000. In the case of these

bonds, the government reserves the option of redemption at the

end of the first year after issue or on any thereafter prior to

maturity, thus providing the government with an opportunity

to benefit from any future decline in the interest rate. Total

issues of this instrument amounted to Rs.650 million.

Operational Activities

The total outstanding gross public debt serviced by the PDD

at end 2000 amounted to Rs.l, 147,968 million. This indicated

an increase of Rs. 138,750 million or 13.8 per cent compared

with the outstanding value at end 1999. The composition of

public debt outstanding at end 2000 included Rs.603,026

million (52.5 per cent) of domestic debt and Rs.544,942 million

(47.5 per cent) of foreign debt. The domestic component of

public debt increased by Rs.l 11,089 million (22.6 per cent)

while foreign debt rose by Rs.27,661 million (5.3 percent) over

that of 1999. Table H-17 shows the composition of public debt

serviced by the PDD.

Treasury Bills

The total Treasury bills outstanding at end 2000 was

Rs. 134,996 million as compared with Rs. 124,996 million at end

1999. This was the result of net new issues of Rs. 10,000 million

(i.e. new issues of Rs. 13,000 million and retirements of

Rs.3,000 million) Treasury bills during 2000. The authorised

limit of Treasury bills was raised from Rs. 125,000 million to

Rs. 135,000 million during the year.

The total bids received during the year amounted to

Rs.248,244 million as against a total issue of Rs. 182,044

million. Of this, PDs purchased bills amounting to Rs.l 18,292

million or 65.0 per cent of the total issues. Special funds

managed by the Central Bank purchased 5.7 per cent of the bills

issued, at the weighted average yield rates. The amount of

Treasury bills purchased by the Central Bank during the year

amounted to Rs.53,429 million or 29.3 per cent. Table 11-18

shows the maturitywise distribution of sales of Treasury bills

by source.

Rupee Securities

A total of 15 Rupee security (RS) issues, amounting to Rs.42,211 million were floated during 2000. The EPF and the

NSB continued to be the major subscribers to the RS

programme in 2000, and these two institutions subscribed to

Rs.41,190 million, accounting for 97.6 per cent of total

subscriptions.

Rupee loans issued during 2000 carried interest rates of

11.00 per cent per annum, 11.90 per cent per annum and 12.00

per cent per annum for maturities of 5/6, 1 and 8/10 years,

respectively. One of these RSs was floated with a fixed maturity

of 1 year, four were floated with optional maturity of 5/6 years,

and the other 10 issues were with optional maturity of 8/10

years. Information relating to flotation and repayment of RSs

in 2000 is summarised in Table 11-20.

A total of 12 Rupee loans, amounting to Rs.40,378

million, were repaid during 2000. Accordingly, net

subscriptions to RSs amounted to Rs. 1,832 million. This

resulted in an increase in the outstanding liabilities on account

of RSs from Rs.262,056 million at end 1999 to Rs.263,888

million at end 2000. The maturity profile of outstanding RSs

is presented in Table 11-21.

Total interest payments on RSs in 2000 amounted to

Rs.33,902 million in 2000, an increase of Rs. 1,099 million

(3.4 per cent) over the previous year. The PDD made interest

payments on account of 769 interest warrants during 2000.

The Centre for Banking Studies

The Centre for Banking Studies (CBS) conducted training

programmes for employees of the Bank and personnel in the

financial sector to equip them with the required skills to meet

the challenges arising from technological advances and

innovations in the financial sector. In 2000, the CBS conducted

90 training programmes for 2,265 participants covering 2,969

training hours. About 49 per cent of the participants were from

the Central Bank. Of the total number of programmes

conducted by the CBS, 76 programmes were included in the

Programme Calendar for 2000, for which 43 per cent of the

participants were from the Central Bank and 39 per cent were

from commercial banks. The rest were from the specialised

banks including regional development banks, finance

companies, ministries and other financial sector institutions. Of

the 14 special programmes conducted, the CBS provided

logistical support for 2 international programmes conducted by

the Central Bank. These programmes were the Financial

Stability Institute/SEANZA Forum of Banking Supervision

Workshop on 'Credit Risk Management and Asset Quality'

conducted from 22 - 24 May 2000 and the 23rd SEANZA

Central Banking Course conducted from 1 2 - 2 6 August 2000.

In 2000, the CBS offered more training opportunities to

employees of the Bank for training in information technology

and computer operations by conducting 31 programmes for a

total of 413 participants of which 81 per cent were from the

Bank. Three programmes covering 144 training hours each

were conducted in application software, especially for the newly

recruited staff officers to the Bank. The duration of most

computer programmes was 60 hours.

Short-term seminars and courses at the CBS covered

subjects such as commercial banking, banking supervision and

regulation, financial and capital markets, central banking, rural

banking and skills development. There were 14 topics covered

under commercial banking attended by 357 participants and the

more popular courses were on Hire Purchase and Lease

Financing, Law Relating to Securities and Documentation,

Collateral and Related Legal Procedures, Effective Loan

Management, Financial Statement Analysis and Understanding

a Bank Balance Sheet. There were 199 participants, mainly

(XXXIX)

from commercial banks, who attended programmes on banking

supervision and regulation. A majority of them attended

seminars on Prevention of Financial Frauds and Combating

Computer Crimes, Capital Adequacy, Money Laundering

Control, Management Information and Internal Control Systems

for Banks and Credit Risk Management and Banking System

Failures. In addition, there were 6 in-house training

programmes for officers of the Bank Supervision Department

Courses in Commercial Banking and Central Banking. A

Certificate course in English was conducted for only officers

of the Bank. Skills development programmes on Report

Writing, Office Management and Office Procedures and other

basic level courses were also conducted by the CBS, some of

which were mainly for Central Bank staff. There were 50

officers who attended three programmes especially designed for

officers of the regional development banks. The CBS, for the

first time, offered a series of Senior Management Seminars on

Capital Account Liberalisation: Current Issues, Understanding

Governance, Corporate Debt Security Market in Sri Lanka and

Seventy two Central Bank employees made use of the Self Access Centre (SAC) for English to improve their language skills. Classes were held on oral communication and report writing to supplement the facilities available at the Centre.

Secretariat

The Secretariat Department continued to provide corporate

services such as finance, supplies, travel and other

miscellaneous services which facilitated the work of the Bank.

In 2000, the system of self-monitoring of departmental

expenditure by the departments of the Bank was further

strengthened by the Secretariat issuing guidelines on steps that

should be taken for the purpose. These supplemented the

existing comprehensive budgetary system, which ensures strict

financial controls within the framework of the comprehensive

corporate plan of the Bank.

There was marked improvements in employer employee

relations in the Bank in 2000. After negotiative with the trade

unions of the Bank the wages and benefits of employees were

improved and a collective agreement between the Bank and all

trade unions was extended into covering the period 1 January

2000 to end 2002.

Legal

The work carried out by the Legal Department can broadly be

categorised as advising the Bank on legal issues, representing

the Bank in courts and in other legal fora, and contributing to

the further development of laws in the banking/financial sector.

As in previous years, the Department continued to provide

advisory services to the other departments of the Bank, and to

instruct counsel in litigation in which the Monetary Board and

Central Bank officers were parties. The major reforms to laws

that were undertaken in 2000 include proposed amendments to

the Monetary Law Act No.58 of 1949, the Banking Act, No.30

of 1988 and to legislation relating to debt recovery by financial

institutions.

Premises

During 2000, the Premises Department continued the

maintenance and up-keep of the premises taken on lease and

also the Central Bank's own premises. In addition, the

Department continued to provide support services such as

transport and communication facilities.

The Department completed the conservation work of the

Chatham Street Clock Tower in consultation with the

Archaeological Department and the Central Engineering

Consultancy Bureau. A chime based on the well-known song

'Danno Budunge' was installed in the clock with technical

support from the Arthur C. Clarke Institute for Modern

Technologies.

New Buildings

The New Buildings Department was established on 18

November 1997 to handle the twin tasks of monitoring and

supervising the work connected with the construction of the

Central Bank Extension Building and the Rehabilitation of the

damaged Head Office Building.

Extension to the Central Bank Building

The construction work of the Extension Building was completed at the end of 1999. After a soft opening, occupation of the building took place in stages. The building was formally declared opened by Her Excellency Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunge, President of Sri Lanka and the Minister of Finance and Planning on the occasion of the Golden Jubilee of the Central Bank, on 27 August 2000.

During the year, the Department worked towards providing a pleasant and secure working environment for the staff of the Central Bank. The work included landscaping of the Bank's premises, construction of a security fence and refurbishing the offices.

New furniture was supplied to the Heads of Departments, Additional Heads of Departments and some others to modernise the furniture provided to the staff. Modular designed furniture

( X L I )

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

were also ordered for the staff of the Banking, Economic

Research and Information Technology Departments. The other

departments too will be supplied with similar furniture.

To ensure efficient and interruption free services in the

building, an agreement was signed with M/s. Sudd ETNA Werk

GmbH, Germany for the maintenance of mechanical services

for a period of one year from October, 2000.

Rehabilitation of the Damaged Central Bank Building

The rehabilitation work of the damaged Central Bank building,

which commenced in December 1997, continued during the

year. The completion of this project, which was scheduled for

the middle of 2000, was held up due to unforeseen

circumstances, but is expected to be completed by mid 2001.

Additional work undertaken for the construction of a fully

equipped Conference Hall, and changes in the design also

contributed to the delay.

Construction of a Car Park

A land, 140 perches in extent, was taken on lease from the

Urban Development Authority (UDA) for a period of 99 years

at a total cost of Rs.113 million. Possession of the land was

taken on 27 October 2000 and the land has been cleared for

surface parking as the first stage of this project. The Department

is currently engaged in designing a multi storeyed car park and

obtaining the necessary legal and other clearances for its

construuction.

Security Services

By the beginning of 2000, all departments of the Central Bank

that were located at the World Trade Centre had moved into

the New Extension Building at Janadhipathi Mawatha.

The Security Services Department trained its officers on

the electronic security systems installed in the building.

In addition, all security officers were trained on fire

fighting and handling of fire arms. Live firing was also

conducted during the year.

During the period under review, the Department provided

security to all premises occupied by the Bank, for movement

of currency to and from the Regional Offices and other places

and for the transport of building materials for construction

work.

The Department worked very closely with the government

security establishments and the Intelligence Agencies in

implementing security measures required for the safety of the

Bank.

Information

The Information Department of the Bank continued to function

as the central information unit, responsible for collection and

dissemination of information to Bank personnel and to the

public through multi-media.

In the dissemination of management and general

information within the Bank, the Department continued to issue

the Internal News Letter regularly.

In disseminating information to the outside world, the

Department arranged to issue the daily exchange rates, weekly

and monthly economic indicators, consumer price indices,

information on Treasury bills, Treasury bonds and Rupee loans

to the electronic and print media. In addition, the issue of

official press releases and the Bank's publicity work were also

undertaken by this Department.

As in the previous years, the Department, on behalf of the

Bank, printed the Annual Report, the State of the Economy,

the Sri Lanka Socio-Economic Data, the Monthly Bulletin, and

Economic and Social Statistics. Two issues of Staff Studies

(Vol.25 - 26 and 27 - 28) were also released together with the

Report of the Consumer Finance and Socio Economic Survey

1996/97 (Part II) and the Sri Lanka Economy - 1999 and the

Medium Term Prospects. Satahana, the Sinhala monthly, and

the News Survey, the English bi-monthly, were two other

publications issued by the Department.

A book titled 'History of Coins and Currency of Sri

Lanka' was published to mark the 50th Anniversary of the

Central Bank. 'Pahan Tharuwa', an educational television

documentary on the function of the Central Bank was also

produced to mark the occasion.

The Printing Press of the Central Bank continued to meet

the bulk of the printing needs of the Bank. Apart from printing

the publications mentioned above, the Central Bank Press

undertook the printing of the publication 'Trends in Public

Finance' for the Ministry of Finance and Planning. The

Department also provided photographic and artistic design

services in the Bank.

Library and Information Centre

The Bank's Library, which is also responsible for dissemination of information, was renamed as the Library and Information Centre (LIC). The IDF Project under the World Bank Technical Assistance programme, which funded the rebuilding of the CBSL Library, was completed during the year, with the automation of operations of the LIC. Under this project, a CD-ROM database on 'Global Business Periodicals' was added to the library collection, and the library staff were trained on current developments in Libraries abroad.

During the year, the LIC continued to provide compilations such as Current Article titles with abstracts, Web Watch, Recent Acquisitions, Current Contents, BIS Review, Web Directory and Central Banking Around the World via the Intranet. The Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) facility provided for the accessibility of Library holdings.

During the year under review, the LIC has built up a collection of 9,040 books, 494 periodical titles and 680 CD-ROMS.

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

Information Technology

The Information Technology Department (ITD) was involved

in the management, operation and development of the Bank's

computer systems. Responding to the progress in information

processing technology in Sri Lanka and abroad, the IT facilities

were expanded to reach a larger number of the Bank's

workforce enabling them to perform in a computerised

environment, conducive for promoting efficiency and reducing

operational costs. The main focus of the ITD during the year

was to introduce new technology, re-engineer the existing

computer systems and upgrade the IT skills of the staff to meet

the future challenges in keeping with the long-term vision of

the Bank.

The existing AS/400 computer systems were upgraded

during the year. The capacity expanded in terms of the

processor, main memory and secondary storage enabling it to

support new applications which would be introduced during the

next 3-4 years and existing applications which may expand.

A Local Area Network (LAN) was established linking 250

personal computers in departments located in the New Central

Bank Building. The inter-departmental connectivity is provided

through a fibre optic cable for optimum operational reliability.

The LAN is currently used for better dissemination of

information and sharing data between departments and reducing

duplication of effort. Other salient features of the LAN are, that

it had made possible - (a) the sharing of IT resources, namely

critical software and peripheral devices, among a large number

of users; (b) streamlining personal communication with e-mail;

and, (c) making the file back-up process efficient. After

establishing the LAN, on-line reservation of reading material

from the Library for reference and borrowing has become

possible, enabling more effective use of the 'LIBSYS' System.

To facilitate fast, easy and economical communication both

within the Bank and with outside institutions, the E-mail

facilities are provided to officers, while the internet facility is

extended only to the senior officers.

A Wide Area Network (WAN) connecting the head offices

of all commercial banks and Primary Dealers to the Central

Bank was established and made functional during the year. The

WAN enables banks and primary dealers to communicate

simultaneously with the CBSL AS/400 computer. Accordingly,

the physical infrastructure is ready to move to a modern

payment system, where large value funds could be securely

transacted on-line, with funds settled across the CBSL books

in real-time as the transactions occur.

Currently, the WAN is used for the following purposes:

I For banks to send information required by the CBSL for

liquidity management;

• To conduct Open Market Operations;

I To conduct the Primary Auctions in government debt

securities;

ft To obtain two-way quotes of US dollar/SL Rupee

exchange rates in commercial bank forex operations.

The ITD continued to develop several AS/400 and

PC-based applications. An application system for on-line

trading and settlement of government debt securities among

Primary Dealers was developed and installed in their Treasury

Offices. This would facilitate a Delivery vs Payment

mechanism, where delivery of securities occurs if and only if

payment is made. The system has been extensively tested and

the parallel run is expected to commence in April 2001.

The ITD examined the Staff Payment Modules with a

view to overhauling the system, introducing better security

features and streamlining the processes to reduce human

intervention. A new system for Staff Welfare Loans was

developed for implementation from 01 January 2001. The

Widows and Orphans Pension System was modified

extensively to upgrade the functional efficiency of the system

as well as to meet the necessary security standards. After

undertaking a system study, the development of a new system

for staff payroll commenced during the fourth quarter of the

year.

The ITD computerised the SMI loans scheme of the

Development Finance Department.

A centralised system to process employee attendance,

leave and similar information of relevance was developed in

an AS/400 environment. This system will maintain a centralised

database to record employee sign-on/off times, leave and short-

leave records, overtime and shift-work information. For

administrative purposes, the departments will access the

centralised database to obtain records relevant to their

employees. In the future, this centralised system will

substantially reduce the manual work currently being done to

maintain these records in each department. The 'parallel run'

of the new system is in progress.

The LTD continued to maintain the EPF application system

and further automation of the EPF Department was undertaken

during the year under review. Several projects to computerise

namely, refund part payments and Refund payment returns,

bank reconciliation system, member accounts amalgamation,

housing loan certificate printing and monitoring of loan

applications, in-house records' movement system were

developed and implemented. A system was also undertaken to

computerise the EPF investment and, as an initial step, sales

and purchases of Treasury bills were computerised. This was

in addition to the overall maintenance of the EPF computer

installation located in the EPF Department.

The Sri Lanka Automated Clearing House continued to

operate the system for the inter-bank exchange and clearing of

cheques. The number of cheques, cleared in 2000 increased by

5.8 per cent o reach 34,561,846 cheques. Meanwhile the value

of payments handled during the same year was Rs.9.23 billion.

IT strategies to further strengthen the operational reliability of

the cheque clearing system were undertaken, including the

operation of a back-up computer from a remote location as a

fall-back option in the event of a break-down or disaster at the

main site.

Part II Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

Following the trend in recent years, the volume of SLIPS

transactions increased rapidly during the year, recording a

growth of 29.7 per cent. The value of SLIPS transactions

processed during the year was Rs.51.9 billion, compared to

Rs.42.9 billion in 1999. In view of the rapid growth in SLIPS

transactions, modifications to the SLIPS processing software

were undertaken to reduce the processing time. The

development of software was outsourced to a private company.

The direct debit transfer system, which was relatively inactive

for a long time, showed an improvement with several

companies providing communication services and banks joining

to collect their bills and credit card payments through this

system.

Management Audit

In accordance with the Annual Audit Programme and the Audit

Plan for 2000 approved by the Monetary Board, the

Management Audit Department (MAD) carried out its internal

audit and management service functions during the year with

the objective of increasing the efficiency, economy and

effectiveness in the performance of the Central Bank.

Pre-auditing was carried out on all payments relating to

the construction of the Extension Building and the rehabilitation

of the Head Office Building, all emoluments paid to Bank

employees, annual financial statements prepared by the

Secretariat and Welfare Departments relating to the Pension

Fund, Provident Fund, Widow's and Widower's Pension Funds

and other Welfare schemes of the Central Bank and also refunds

on retirement or termination of the Bank service. The Central

Bank Balance sheet as at 31.12.2000 and the Income and

Expenditure statements of the Centre for Banking Studies and

the Sri Lanka Automated Clearing House were also pre-audited

before submission to the Management.

The Management Services Division of the Department

carried out a number of studies, including a study on the

payment of overtime to drivers and the work performance of

the minor employees in technical grades in the Bank.

Training

In terms of Section 27 of the Monetary Law Act, the Central Bank promotes and sponsors the training of suitable employees in subjects relevant to the Bank, both in Sri Lanka and abroad. As one of the Departments of the Bank engaged in the functions relating to development of human resources in the Bank, the Training Department continued to implement and promote various training activities throughout 2000.

On the academic front, training is related to postgraduate studies in Economics and allied fields at recognised universities in Sri Lanka and abroad. During the year under review, two officers proceeded abroad to follow Master's Degree programmes in Economics and Finance. Three officers followed Doctoral programmes in Economics at Universities

in Sri Lanka and abroad and two officers followed the

Postgraduate Diploma in Computer Technology at the Colombo

University. Another officer pursued a postgraduate Diploma

course in Statistics at the International Statistical Education

Centre, Calcutta.
