The degree of a bank's exposure to varied banking risks, such as default risk (credit risk), market risk, liquidity risk and operational risks, and a bank's ability to contain such risks, if any, to minimum levels are also appraised in the overall assessment of a bank. As a part of the scope of on-site examinations, other key aspects such as capital adequacy, management quality, earnings and liquidity are also assessed. In addition, banks' compliance with statutory requirements, applicable laws and regulations and internal controls as well as their systems and procedures too are examined. During the year under review, the BSD commenced 14 on-site examinations, which included 10 LCBs and 4 LSBs. In addition, on-site examinations of 7 LCBs and 2 LSBs which commenced in the previous year were concluded in 2000.",

The slow progress of the project was taken into consideration by the officials of the funding agencies, and the government had negotiations with the National Development Trust Fund (NDTF) to explore the possibility of allocating part of the funds to refinance sub loans under the Project. However, having failed to obtain funds from the NDTF, the Mid - Term Review Missions of the ADB and IFAD to Sri Lanka in 2000 agreed to allocate funds from the unutilised funds of these projects for provision of refinance to PCIs.

The project PAMP aims at setting up an effective credit delivery mechanism for channelling institutional credit for income generating activities to the rural poor who have had no access to credit from formal credit institutions. The project also expects to improve the economic conditions and the general welfare of the beneficiaries and eventually contribute to the economic and social development of Sri Lanka. Six districts viz., Badulla, Nuwara Eliya, Matale, Kalutara, Kurunegala and Hambantota, have been identified for project implementation.",
