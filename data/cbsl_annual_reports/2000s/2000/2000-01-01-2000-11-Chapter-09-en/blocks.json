    "text": "The global economy witnessed a strong recovery in 2000 after a depressed economic environment seen in many parts of the world after the outbreak of the East Asian currency crises, followed by crises in Russia and Brazil. A robust economy in the US, some economic recovery in Japan, continued growth in Europe and fast recovery in crisis affected countries eliminated the risk of a continuation of a global economic slowdown. The gradual build up of investor confidence brought some stability to exchange and capital markets. The economic recovery in most affected East Asian countries and the higher global demand had a positive impact on commodity markets, which had remained depressed during the past two years. Thus, the recovery of world trade improved the external environment for Sri Lanka. However, sharp increases in international petroleum prices and high security related imports exerted heavy pressure on the balance of payments of Sri Lanka, which led to a sharp drop in external reserves, exerting pressure on the exchange rate. In order to arrest the situation, several changes were made in the exchange rate management of the country.",

    "text": "In line with the recovery in global trade, Sri Lanka's external trade registered a notable upturn with both exports and imports growing at faster rates in 2000. However, the trade deficit widened sharply owing to higher outlays on the import of petroleum products and security related material. The surplus in the services account declined owing to a slowdown in the tourism sector. The deficit in the income account widened further both due to higher interest payments on external debt and a drop in interest earnings on external reserves. However, there was a notable improvement in net current transfers arising largely from higher private transfers from expatriate nationals. As a result of these developments, the deficit in the current account widened significantly from US dollars 563 million (or 3.6 per cent of GDP) in 1999 to US dollars 1,065 million (or 6.4 per cent of GDP) in 2000. Net capital and financial inflows increased from US dollars 373 million to US dollars 565 million, as a result of an increase in private short term borrowing and an increase in net capital inflows to the government, which offset a drop in capital transfers. As the increase in net capital and financial flows were not adequate to cover the sharp increase in the current account deficit, the overall deficit in the balance of payments reflected a deterioration, the deficit of US dollars 263 million in 1999 falling further to US dollars 516 million in 2000.",

Despite the higher international prices that prevailed throughout 2000, the quantity of petroleum exports declined by 31 per cent during the latter half of 2000. This reduction was largely in bunkering fuel, as local production had to cater to increased use of those products locally for electricity generation and industrial activity. As a result, earnings from petroleum exports increased at a much slower rate of 5 per cent during the latter half of 2000.",

Lower production in major producing countries due to unfavourable weather and increased demand for NR in world markets, particularly from USA, the Republic of Korea, Japan and China contributed to growth in rubber prices. Prices of all major grades of rubber products increased, resulting in an increase in the average price from US dollar 0.77 per kg in 1999 to US dollar 0.89 per kg in 2000. The average export price of latex and other crepe rubber except sole crepe, rose by 23 per cent while the average price of sheet rubber grades increased by 8 per cent in 2000. Earnings from rubber exports accounted for less than 1 per cent of total exports.",

    "text": "imports increased by 15 per cent due to higher quantity and higher prices. Following the government decision to liberalise wheat and flour imports on 29 February 2000, flour imports increased by 42 per cent from 24,427 metric tons in 1999 to 34,706 metric tons in 2000, but still accounted only for a relatively small share of demand for wheat flour. Wheat grain imports grew by 7 per cent to 921,653 metric tons. Expenditure on sugar imports increased by 33 per cent. During the first half of 2000, higher yields from the Maha harvest and accumulated stocks from the previous year resulted in lower imports of rice. However, the government brought rice under import controls on 21 July 2000 limiting the import of rice to high quality varieties in order to ensure a reasonable price for domestic paddy farmers. Rice imports are subject to 35 per cent import duty. Accordingly, imports of rice (14,855 metric tons) declined by 93 per cent despite the marginal drop in local paddy production (2,859,000 metric tons) in the Yala season. Among other food items, imports of milk products, fish products, lentils, big onions, chillies, maize, chickpeas and peas, malt, garlic, liquor, chocolate and sugar confectionery and fruits such as oranges, apples and grapes were higher in 2000. Imports of potatoes declined reflecting",

The euro continued to slide against the dollar during most of the year with an annual depreciation of 7.7 per cent, with recovery towards the end of the year. The pound sterling depreciated by 7.9 per cent during the year while the Indian rupee weakened by 6.8 per cent. The Singapore dollar remained relatively stable through the year with a depreciation of 3,9 per cent. The Korean won and the Thai baht depreciated by 10.0 per cent and 13.5 per cent, respectively, with a faster rate of depreciation towards the latter part of the year. Meanwhile, prevailing economic and political uncertainties in Indonesia and the Philippines resulted in a faster depreciation of 26.1 per cent and 19.6 per cent in the rupiah and the peso, respectively.

This was mainly due to a sharp increase in the forward premium during the second half. Market expectations of a sharp depreciation and the increase in domestic interest rates, pushed up the premia. The premium for one month as a percentage of the spot rate, increased from 4.32 per cent at the end of 1999 to 9.3 per cent at the end of June 2000 and to 17.97 per cent at the end of 2000.

A competitive firm needs to be moving away from state paternalism towards exploiting its own strengths; aggressively relying on advanced factors of production, enhancing knowledge about its competitors and global consumers, while engaging in strategic co-operation and forming alliances with other firms and industry clusters. The macroeconomy needs to be made more efficient by liberalising the economy (both factor and product markets), enhancing openness to the rest of the world, redefining the role of the government, rationalising government expenditure and deficits, maintaining an efficient network of financial and physical infrastructure, enhancing acquisition of technology, upgrading research and development efforts and establishing a facilitating legal framework.",

Later, in 1996, TQB was constituted as a statutory body by the Textile Quota Board Act. No.33 of 1996. However, quota restrictions are to be phased out completely by 2005 under the Uruguay Round Agreement on Textile and Clothing (Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA)).

To provide flexibility, exporters who hold Performance Quota are permitted to transfer unutilised quota to exporters through TQB on a permanent or temporary basis.
