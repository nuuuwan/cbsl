9. TRADE, BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND TOURISM

9.1 Overview

The global economy witnessed a strong recovery in 2000 after a depressed economic environment seen in many parts of the world after the outbreak of the East Asian currency crises, followed by crises in Russia and Brazil. A robust economy in the US, some economic recovery in Japan, continued growth in Europe and fast recovery in crisis affected countries eliminated the risk of a continuation of a global economic slowdown. The gradual build up of investor confidence brought some stability to exchange and capital markets. The economic recovery in most affected East Asian countries and the higher global demand had a positive impact on commodity markets, which had remained depressed during the past two years. Thus, the recovery of world trade improved the external environment for Sri Lanka. However, sharp increases in international petroleum prices and high security related imports exerted heavy pressure on the balance of payments of Sri Lanka, which led to a sharp drop in external reserves, exerting pressure on the exchange rate. In order to arrest the situation, several changes were made in the exchange rate management of the country.

In line with the recovery in global trade, Sri Lanka's external trade registered a notable upturn with both exports and imports growing at faster rates in 2000. However, the trade deficit widened sharply owing to higher outlays on the import of petroleum products and security related material. The surplus in the services account declined owing to a slowdown in the tourism sector. The deficit in the income account widened further both due to higher interest payments on external debt and a drop in interest earnings on external reserves. However, there was a notable improvement in net current transfers arising largely from higher private transfers from expatriate nationals. As a result of these developments, the deficit in the current account widened significantly from US dollars 563 million (or 3.6 per cent of GDP) in 1999 to US dollars 1,065 million (or 6.4 per cent of GDP) in 2000. Net capital and financial inflows increased from US dollars 373 million to US dollars 565 million, as a result of an increase in private short term borrowing and an increase in net capital inflows to the government, which offset a drop in capital transfers. As the increase in net capital and financial flows were not adequate to cover the sharp increase in the current account deficit, the overall deficit in the balance of payments reflected a deterioration, the deficit of US dollars 263 million in 1999 falling further to US dollars 516 million in 2000.

Sri Lanka's external trade recovered rapidly in 2000

after a significant slowdown in 1999 affected by the lagged

effects of the financial crises in Asia and Russia. Exports

grew at 20 per cent in 2000 against a drop of 4 per cent

in 1999. This was mainly the result of an increase in the

volume of exports by 18 per cent. Meanwhile, imports

(excluding aircraft), increased by 24 per cent, reflecting

both increased volumes and higher international commodity

prices1. Consequently, the trade deficit widened by 31 per

cent to US dollars 1,798 million. The trade deficit, as a

percentage of GDP, increased from 8.7 per cent in 1999

to 10.8 per cent in 2000, the highest since 1995.

The surplus in the services account dropped

significantly due to declines in receipts from travel and

transportation services. Net receipts from travel declined

from US dollars 55 to US dollars 8 million, mainly

reflecting an 8 per cent decline in tourist arrivals during

the year. Port related services continued to suffer from

competition from neighbouring countries during the year.

Meanwhile, the deficit in the income account widened from

US dollars 254 to US dollars 304 million. This was the

result of higher net interest payments resulting from a 10

per cent decline in interest income on foreign investments

and a 12 per cent increase in interest payments on foreign

debt.

Gross private transfer receipts increased by 10 per cent

to US dollars 1,160 million. This was boosted by

compensation payments to workers affected by the Gulf

War, amounting to US dollars 45 million, received during

the year. As a result, net private transfers increased from

US dollars 887 to US dollars 974 million. Net current

official transfers declined marginally from US dollars 26 to

US dollars 25 million during 2000. With these

developments in the trade, services, income and transfers

accounts, the deficit in the current account widened from

US dollars 563 million in 1999 to US dollars 1,065 million

in 2000.

The capital and financial accounts registered a notable

improvement with the surplus ricing from US dollars 373

million in 1999 to US dollars 568 million. This was mainly

on account of increases in long-term capital flows to the

government and short-term financial flows to the private

sector. Net capital transfers declined from US dollars 80 to

US dollars 51 million as a result of a drop in grants during

the year. Meanwhile, the surplus in the financial account

increased from US dollars 293 million in 1999 to US

dollars 516 million in 2000 mainly owing to increases in

1 The import of aircraft under the refleeting programme, a relatively large item in imports, is financed through a suppliers' credit. Hence, the analysis was made excluding aricraft.

government long-term investment inflows and private short-

term inflows. Net foreign direct investment inflows declined

marginally from US dollars 177 to US dollars 173 million,

reflecting a decline of 13 per cent in FDI inflows and a

significant drop in capital outflows arising from direct

investments abroad by Sri Lankan residents. As in the

previous year, the uncertain environment disrupted Sri

Lanka's privatisation programme in 2000. Net private long

term capital inflows declined from US dollars 196 to US

dollars 82 million, reflecting both a drop in capital inflows

and an increase in debt repayments during the year,

especially by SriLankan Airlines. Net long-term capital

flows to the government increased from US dollars 62

million in 1999 to US dollars 171 million, mainly due to

an increase in long-term suppliers' credit and a decline in

loan repayments during the year. Temporary disruptions to

project implementation by elections held during the year,

delays in aid utilisation and the continued general decline

in resource availability from donor countries, affected

capital flows to the government. Loan repayments during

the year included the repayment of the remaining amount

of US dollars 16 million of the US dollars 50 million

Floating Rate Notes (FRN) issued in 1997. In contrast, net

short-term capital flows reflected a turnaround from an

outflow of US dollars 142 million to a net inflow of US

dollars 88 million during the year. This was the net result

of increased foreign liabilities of commercial banks, higher

private short-term trade credit and an increased outflow of

portfolio investments.

The external debt stock of the country declined by 2.5

per cent to US dollars 8,859 million, mainly due to a

decline of US dollars 246 million (4 per cent) in

concessional debt and a drop of US dollars 61 million (32

per cent) in non-concessional debt of the government, offset

to some extent by an increase of US dollars 76 million (6

per cent) in non-concessional debt of the private sector. The

drop in the debt stock during the year was entirely due to

cross rate changes among major international currencies.

The bulk of the total debt stock (77 per cent) comprised

concessional debt, while non-concessional debt accounted

for the remaining 23 per cent. The external debt/GDP ratio

declined from 57.8 per cent in 1999 to 53.5 per cent in

2000, while the external debt service ratio declined from

12.4 per cent to 12.2 per cent.

International exchange markets continued to remain

stable during the year. However, despite a relatively low

rate of inflation, the deteriorating balance of payments

continued to exert pressure on the Sri Lanka rupee. The

rupee depreciated by 9.9 per cent during 2000, as measured

by the change in the average of the Central Bank's buying

anjd selling rates for the US dollar; the corresponding

depreciation was 12.6 per cent in the interbank average

exchange rate. The real effective exchange rate of the Sri

Lanka rupee against a 24 currency basket showed a

marginal appreciation of 0.6 per cent in 2000, maintaining

the country's external competitiveness.

Total gross external assets of the country declined by

18 per cent to US dollars 2,126 million at the end of 2000

and were sufficient to finance 3.5 month of imports in

2000. Meanwhile, gross official reserves declined by 36 per

cent to US dollars 1,043 million and were sufficient to

finance 1.7 months of imports in 2000.

9.2 Exports

Sri Lanka's exports grew significantly throughout 2000,

benefiting from both external and internal favourable

developments. Total export earnings, amounting to US

dollars 5,522 million in 2000, grew by 20 per cent

compared to the 4 per cent decline in 1999. This growth

was generated mainly by the continued expansion in textiles

and garments, tea, machinery, mechanical and electrical

equipment, rubber based products, fish products, gems,

diamonds and jewellery exports. The increase in exports is

attributable to a moderate recovery in commodity prices as

well as improved global demand. The export price index

rose by 2 per cent, while the volume index rose by 18 per

cent, accounting for a large part of the increase in export

earnings. International terms of trade deteriorated for the

second consecutive year reflecting unfavourable international

price developments.

Export trade recovered, beginning the last quarter of

1999, due to healthy growth in the world economy, particularly robust growth in USA and the European Union

(EU). There was an improved demand for textiles and garments from those countries. Recovery in the Japanese economy strengthened the market for Sri Lankan products, particularly gems, jewellery and diamonds. Similarly, as way, recovery in the transition economies and the Middle East countries too helped in satisfying the demand for tea, improving the prices. The fast recovery in the East Asian economies and subsequent appreciation of their currencies increased Sri Lanka's competitiveness in major export items such as garments and rubber based products.

Export Structure

Spurred by the economic liberalisation in 1977, industrial

exports became more significant beginning the early 1980's,

and the share of plantation agricultural commodities in total

exports declined from 74 per cent in 1977 to 15 per cent

in 2000. Industrial exports continued to be the major

contributor to expanding exports, the share of which

increased from 14 per cent in 1977 to 78 per cent in 2000.

This ratio has remained around 75 per cent during the last

8 years. Textiles and garments, which became Sri Lanka's

largest single item of exports in 1986, continued to maintain

its dominant position, increasing its share from 2 per cent

in 1977 to 28 per cent in 1986 and further to 54 per cent

in 2000. Although earnings from the textiles and garment

sector were high, tea remained the country's largest net

foreign exchange earner until 1991. However, textiles and

garments came to this lead position in 1992 and continued

to be in that position thereafter.

In 2000, the share of industrial exports in total exports,

led by textiles and garments, increased to 78 per cent from

77 per cent in 1999. Industrial exports consisted of textiles

and garments (70 per cent), machinery and equipment (6

per cent), rubber products (5 per cent), diamonds and

jewellery (4 per cent), leather goods (4 per cent), prawns

and other fish products (3 per cent), petroleum products (2

per cent), ceramic products (1 per cent) and other industrial

exports (5 per cent). The share of agricultural exports

declined from 21 per cent in 1999 to 18 per cent in 2000

attributable to lower contributions from rubber, coconut and

minor agricultural products. The share of mineral exports

increased from 1 per cent to 2 per cent, while other exports

accounted for 2 per cent of the total in 2000 against 1 per

cent in 1999. Other exports include re-exports of parts of

airplanes and textile items.

Several sectors showed significant improvements in the last decade, further diversifying the composition of exports and strengthening the resilience in the economy. These were rubber based products, spare parts including electronics, leather products such as footwear and travel goods, diamonds, jewellery, petroleum products, canned food, fruit and fish products, ceramics, handicrafts, chemical products and minor agricultural products. Exports of mineral products, dominated by gems, also improved after 1977. The contribution by all those products taken together, increased from 22 per cent in 1977 to 28 per cent in 2000, surpassing the position held by plantation sector products.

Industrial Exports

Earnings from industrial exports grew by 21 per cent in 2000 reversing the decline of 2 per cent in 1999. The major contributor, textiles and garment exports, increased by 23 per cent in 2000 as against a 1 per cent drop in 1999. The textiles and garment sector, which suffered during the first eight months of 1999, started to recover after September 1999 with improving prices and growth in volume. The volume of textile and garment exports increased by 17 per cent while prices rose by 5 per cent. Garment exports were

higher prior to the beginning of summer and winter seasons

in USA and European countries. Among the sub categories

in the textiles and garment sector, garment exports increased

by 23 per cent while textile exports grew by 20 per cent.

Exports of yarn and other made-up articles increased by 12

per cent and 20 per cent, respectively. Despite the higher

costs of imported raw materials, an improvement in

domestic value addition in textile and garment exports

resulted in an increase in net foreign exchange earnings by

37 per cent to US dollars 1,511 million.

As in the previous year, more than 90 per cent of

textile and garment exports were from BOI companies.

Export earnings in BOI enterprises increased by 24 per cent

in 2000 compared to a 1 per cent decline in 1999. Exports

by non-BOI enterprises rose by 17 per cent in 2000

compared to a decline of 7 per cent in 1999. USA (62 per cent) and EU (33 per cent) led by UK (22 per cent) continued to be the first and second largest markets for textiles and garment exports.

Exports of machinery, mechanical and electrical

equipment grew by 21 per cent as against the growth of

10 per cent in 1999. Major export items in 2000 were parts

and accessories of data processing machines, printed

circuits, electrical transformers, machine tools, screws and

bolts and nuts. This category accounted for 6 per cent of

total industrial exports.

Earnings from rubber based product exports, at US dollars 196 million, indicated an increase of 22 per cent in 2000. Exports of retreaded tyres increased by 23 per cent, while solid and cushion tyres rose by 35 per cent. The

163

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

recovery continued after September 1999, due to the global

economic recovery and high demand from European

countries. Exports of examination gloves recovered after

September 1999, with the adoption of new technology by

the main producers to meet consumer preferences. Exports

of industrial glove showed an improvement while surgical

glove exports declined by 20 per cent due to lower demand.

Those categories of gloves accounted for 31 per cent of the

total rubber based product exports in 2000. Other rubber

based products such as floor coverings and mats, plates and

sheets performed well throughout 2000. A few new

products such as machine parts and floor tiles which

emerged in 1999, continued to expand in 2000. Rubber

based products contributed 5 per cent to total industrial

exports.

Earnings in the food, beverages and tobacco sector

increase'd by 76 per cent in 2000 due to a sharp

improvement in the export of crustaceans, molluscs and

other fish products, which contributed 84 per cent to this

sub category and 3 per cent to the total industrial exports

in 2000. Earnings from prawn exports increased by 80 per

cent in 2000. At present, 'Yellow Head' and 'White Spot'

diseases have been suppressed and the situation has returned

to normal since January 2000. About 80 per cent of the

farming area and all nine factories that process shrimp for

export are now in operation. Government has regularised

14 unauthorised shrimp farms covering 62 hectares in 2000,

which increased the total number of active farms to 955.

The total extent of those farms is 3,752 hectares. With the

extensive awareness programmes conducted by the National

Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency

(NARA), National Aquaculture Development Authority

(NAQDA) and Aquaculture Services Center of the North

Western Provincial Ministry of Fisheries, shrimp farmers

have learnt to prevent or control the outbreak of diseases.

As a result, the quality and the size of prawns and shrimp

have improved attracting new markets. The Ministry of

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development closely

monitored the farms to prevent diseases.

Fish exports improved remarkably after February 1999,

with an increase of 135 per cent in 2000. This was due to

steps taken under the continuous assistance of the Swedish

International Development Co-operation Agency to improve

the quality of fish products in compliance with the

requirements of European markets. As a long-term strategy

to sustain the industry, fishermen were given training to

preserve fish, to maintain quality even at the point of

catching, in addition to instructions given to private

entrepreneurs. The major markets for crustaceans and

molluscs and other fish products continued to be Japan,

USA, Singapore, Hong Kong, UK and East Asian countries.

Economic recovery in those countries contributed positively

to improvements in the industry.

Among other food items, coconut milk powder,

coconut cream, canned or bottled fruit, malted milk, sweet

biscuits, mineral water and animal fodder reported growth

in 2000 over 1999.

Export earnings from travel goods, footwear and other

leather products declined by 12 per cent in 2000. However,

export earnings from hand bags, travel cases with outer

surface of leather and textiles grew. Even though exports

of travel goods declined, the industry showed an expansion

towards the end of 2000. Export earnings from footwear

declined by 18 per cent with a marked drop in exports of

special kinds. Earnings from slippers and canvas shoes

increased in 2000. Exports of other articles of leather,

although small in magnitude, increased significantly in

2000. Earnings from ceramic products declined by 4 per

cent marked by lower exports of tableware. Exports of wall

tiles increased by 10 per cent in 2000.

Diamond exports increased by 12 per cent in 2000 with

exports to Belgium, Israel, Vietnam, USA and Japan. The

jewellery market, which suffered a setback due to the East

Asian crisis, showed steady recovery reporting a 25 per cent

increase in 2000. The Export Development Board (EDB) took

initiatives to improve the skills of craftsmen, the quality of

jewellery manufactured in craft villages, and the skills for

jewellery designing through workshops, seminars and

consultations. Assistance was provided to new and existing

exporters to enter the international market while opportunities

were given to some exporters to participate in local and

international trade fairs and exhibitions. USA continued to be

the largest buyer of jewellery followed by Germany, Japan,

Switzerland and UK.

Earnings from exports of petroleum products increased by 33 per cent in 2000 compared to 1.5 per cent in 1999 due to the substantial growth in the first half of 2000. The value of petroleum product exports increased by 83 per cent during the first half of 2000, the combined effect of both higher prices (67 per cent) and volumes (10 per cent). Despite the higher international prices that prevailed throughout 2000, the quantity of petroleum exports declined by 31 per cent during the latter half of 2000. This reduction was largely in bunkering fuel, as local production had to cater to increased use of those products locally for electricity generation and industrial activity. As a result, earnings from petroleum exports increased at a much slower rate of 5 per cent during the latter half of 2000.

Other manufactured exports such as chemical products,

wooden toys, articles of copper, quartz, brooms and brushes

showed a healthy growth to meet increased demand from

Western countries.

Plantation Crops

Earnings from plantation crops increased by 9 per cent in

2000. Tea exports increased substantially. Exports of the

1 6 4

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

other two major crops, rubber and coconut declined in

2000. Tea prices continued to improve after December

1999, following the combined effect of production shortfalls

in major producing countries such as India and Kenya, and

increased demand from the Commonwealth of Independent

States (CIS) and Middle Eastern countries. Prices increased

rapidly during the first four months of 2000 but decelerated

thereafter with increased world tea production. However,

export prices of tea remained higher than in 1999

throughout the year, benefiting from strong demand. The

average price increased from US dollars 2.30 per kg in

1999 to US dollars 2.43 per kg in 2000. The volume of

tea exports increased by 7 per cent to 288.2 million kg

keeping pace with the highest reported production of 305.8

million kg in 2000, which was 8 per cent higher than 1999.

Out of Sri Lanka's tea exports, 63 per cent was in bulk

form, while 30 per cent was in packed form. The rest was

in higher value added forms such as tea bags, tea blended

with foreign teas and instant and green tea. Orthodox tea

accounted for more than 99 per cent of Sri Lankan tea, and

Cut, Tear and Curl (CTC) tea was produced in small

quantities. Sri Lanka imported 3.6 million kg of tea for

blending purposes, which was 1 per cent of domestic

production in 2000. Russia re-emerged as the largest buyer

(share of 16 per cent) in 2000. The United Arab Emirates

(UAE), which overtook Russia in 1999, became the second

largest buyer (share of 14 per cent), while Syria took the

third position (share of 7.4 per cent) that Turkey held in

1999. Other major buyers were Turkey (share of 7 per

cent), Saudi Arabia and Iran (share of 4 per cent each).

However, as a group, Middle East countries bought 46 per

cent of total tea exports while the CIS countries became

the second largest buyer (share of 20 per cent) followed by

EU (share of 9 per cent) in 2000.

Earnings from three major coconut products declined

by 8 per cent in 2000, due to lower prices which offset

the growth in the quantity of exports in 2000. Export

quantities of desiccated coconuts, copra and coconut oil

increased by 31 per cent, 30 per cent and 28 per cent,

respectively. Following international price trends, average

prices of those three products have declined since

November 1999. This was caused by the recovery of

coconut production in the Philippines and Indonesia after

the last quarter of 1999. Benefiting from rains during the

last quarter of 1999, Sri Lanka also reported a harvest of

3,055 million nuts (growth of 8 per cent ) in 2000. As a

result of the large supply, prices in the local market (retail

price) declined by about 15 per cent (21 per cent in US

dollar terms) over 1999. As a result of this bumper harvest

of coconut, desiccated coconut and coconut oil production

also increased resulting in lower prices. Heavy imports of

substitute vegetable oils to the country too had a depressive

impact on local prices. The government decided to impose

a surcharge of 25 per cent on the prevailing 25 per cent

duty for the period from 21 July 2000 to 12 January 2001

and Rs.20 per kg thereafter to ease the pressure on domestic

coconut oil prices. World market prices of other substitutes

such as palm oil, soybean oil and sunflower oil remained

at lower levels in 2000 than in 1999.

Earnings from other coconut products remained

unchanged in 2000. Despite the higher production of fresh

nuts which provided input for other coconut products, the

quantity of coir fibre mattress exported declined by 37 per

cent largely attributable to reduced competitiveness

consequent upon higher freight rates to USA and increased

cost of raw materials. However, prices increased

substantially, neutralising the negative impact of lower

quantities. Except for fresh nuts and coir fibre bristle, prices

of all other coir products were higher than in the previous

year. Exports of coconut shell charcoal, coir fibre bristle,

coir yarn and fresh nuts also improved in 2000. However,

total export earnings from coconut based products was

about 2 per cent of total exports.

Rubber production in Sri Lanka in 2000 at 87.2 million

kg, the lowest production during the last five decades, was

10 per cent lower than 96.6 million kg in 1999. Local

consumption of rubber increased from 54 million kg to 55

million kg reflecting the expansion of the rubber based

products sub-sector. In order to meet input quality

requirements, 4.3 million kg of natural rubber were

imported by the domestic manufacturing industry in 2000

compared to 1.3 million kg in 1999.

Export prices of natural rubber (NR) continued to increase after December 1999, resulting in a growth of 16 per cent in 2000. In contrast, the volume of rubber exports declined by 24 per cent in 2000. Accordingly, earnings from NR exports declined by 12 per cent. Lower production in major producing countries due to unfavourable weather and increased demand for NR in world markets, particularly from USA, the Republic of Korea, Japan and China contributed to growth in rubber prices. Prices of all major grades of rubber products increased, resulting in an increase in the average price from US dollar 0.77 per kg in 1999 to US dollar 0.89 per kg in 2000. The average export price of latex and other crepe rubber except sole crepe, rose by 23 per cent while the average price of sheet rubber grades increased by 8 per cent in 2000. Earnings from rubber exports accounted for less than 1 per cent of total exports.

Other Agricultural Products

Other agricultural export earnings declined by 6 per cent

in 2000, due to lower quantities of major products. Lower

international prices for cinnamon compelled producers to

limit exports. Cinnamon production remained unchanged in

2000. Export prices of pepper, which remained steady

during the first half of 2000, dropped significantly during

1 6 5

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

the second half of the year responding to international

market trends. Except in India, in all other major pepper

producing countries such as Brazil, Malaysia, Indonesia and

Vietnam, production increased substantially to exert

downward pressure on prices. Sri Lanka's pepper harvest

increased by 15 per cent in 2000, due to favourable

weather. As a result, the volume of pepper exported during

the year increased by 29 per cent with a 13 per cent growth

in export earnings. Despite lower prices, earnings from un­

manufactured tobacco increased by 2 per cent due to higher

demand from Austria, Belgium, UK and Spain. These three

products together accounted for 67 per cent of the 'other

agricultural products' category. Earnings from nutmeg and

mace increased by 25 per cent due to higher prices. Even

though local production of nutmeg and mace dropped

marginally, export volumes increased responding to better

prices. Export earnings from vegetables, fruit, coffee,

cloves, arecanuts, cardamom, betel leaves and cashew nuts

declined over 1999 levels, largely reflecting lower quantities

exported.

Mineral Products

Earnings from the export of all mineral products increased

by 52 per cent contributing about 2 per cent to the total

export earnings in 2000. Gem exports, which covered 96

per cent of mineral exports, increased by 52 per cent. This

growth was due to the recovery in the East Asian markets

and Japan, as well as increased demand from USA and

European countries. Demand for calibrated blue, pink and

yellow sapphires in the European and USA markets

remained stable throughout the year. Sri Lanka continued

to be the largest supplier of high quality blue sapphires of

natural colours to the world market. Prices of these products

grew steadily during the year. Demand for fancy cut semi­

precious stones to USA remained stable. Hong Kong

emerged as the centre for fine gems and jewellery in the

Asian Pacific Region. Japan and Thailand too continued as

major markets for gems with a high potential, while

Switzerland, France, Italy and Germany were among the

major buyers in the European market. The emergence of

Madagascar as a producer of all gem varieties found in Sri

Lanka has resulted in increased competition. On the supply

side, the suspension imposed on the auction of government

and estate owned lands for gem mining resulted in a

shortage of raw gems in 2000. Earnings from other mineral

exports grew by 13 per cent with higher earnings from

natural graphite, metallic ores and iron pyrites.

9.3 Imports

Expenditure on imports grew by 22 per cent to US dollars

7,320 million in 2000. This includes the value of three

aircraft (US dollars 298 million), imported by SriLankan

Airlines in January, May and June 2000 under the re-

fleeting program. Three aircraft were also imported in 1999.

If aircraft imports in both years are excluded, the growth

in imports would be 24 per cent in 2000. The growth in

imports is largely attributable to substantially higher costs

of petroleum products, high demand for intermediary

imports from export manufacturers, and high expenditure on

defence related imports. All three major categories of

imports, consumer goods, intermediate goods and

investment goods, grew over 1999. Consumer goods imports

grew by 12 per cent while intermediate and investment

goods grew by 24 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively.

When aircraft imports are excluded, investment goods

imports rose by 14 per cent reflecting expanding investment

activities.

Growth in imports was a result of an 8 per cent

increase in average import prices and a 13 per cent growth

in volumes. Higher prices of major agricultural and dairy

products (sugar, wheat and milk products) and major inputs

(petroleum, fertiliser and textiles) contributed to the growth

in import prices. Larger volumes of food and consumer

durables, (sugar, wheat, milk products, motor vehicles,

radios and television sets), intermediate goods (petroleum

products, textiles and diamonds) and investment goods

(building materials and machinery) contributed to the

growth in volume.

Import Structure

A significant change in the import structure in favour of

intermediate and investment goods has been observed

during the last 23 years following economic liberalisation

in 1977. The share of intermediate goods increased from

42 per cent in 1977 to 52 per cent in 2000. The expansion

in the industrial sector called for higher imports of

intermediate goods increasing the relative importance of

intermediate goods in total imports. The share of investment

goods increased from 12 per cent in 1977 to 24 per cent

in 2000. Development of infrastructure facilities,

construction and transport, combined with increased use of

advanced technology, increased imports of investment

goods. The share of consumer goods in total imports

declined from 45 per cent in 1977 to 19 per cent over the

same period. When compared with 1999, the relative

importance of intermediate goods increased from 51 per

cent to 52 per cent in 2000. Consumer goods declined from

21 per cent in 1999 to 19 per cent in 2000, while the share

of investment goods declined from 26 per cent to 24 per

cent in 2000.

Consumer Goods

The increase in consumer goods imports was evident in both food and consumer durable categories. Higher international prices of major food items boosted expenditure on the food and drink category. Food imports grew by 5 per cent, due to a substantial increase in expenditure on sugar, wheat, milk foods and other food items. Wheat grain

imports increased by 15 per cent due to higher quantity and higher prices. Following the government decision to liberalise wheat and flour imports on 29 February 2000, flour imports increased by 42 per cent from 24,427 metric tons in 1999 to 34,706 metric tons in 2000, but still accounted only for a relatively small share of demand for wheat flour. Wheat grain imports grew by 7 per cent to 921,653 metric tons. Expenditure on sugar imports increased by 33 per cent. During the first half of 2000, higher yields from the Maha harvest and accumulated stocks from the previous year resulted in lower imports of rice. However, the government brought rice under import controls on 21 July 2000 limiting the import of rice to high quality varieties in order to ensure a reasonable price for domestic paddy farmers. Rice imports are subject to 35 per cent import duty. Accordingly, imports of rice (14,855 metric tons) declined by 93 per cent despite the marginal drop in local paddy production (2,859,000 metric tons) in the Yala season. Among other food items, imports of milk products, fish products, lentils, big onions, chillies, maize, chickpeas and peas, malt, garlic, liquor, chocolate and sugar confectionery and fruits such as oranges, apples and grapes were higher in 2000. Imports of potatoes declined reflecting

the impact of a surcharge of 35 per cent levied in addition

to the 35 per cent import duty, with effect from 30 August

to 8 December 2000. Potato prices were brought under a

duty rate of Rs.20 per kg thereafter.

In the durable consumer goods category, imports of

motor cars and motor cycles increased by 17 per cent,

partly attributable to a partial duty waiver granted for public

sector employees to import motor vehicles. During 2000,

11,767 cars were imported with duty concessions; the

corresponding number was 4,344 in 1999. Imports of radio

receivers and television sets showed an increase of 12 per

cent. Imports of medical and pharmaceutical products rose

by 25 per cent. Imports of rubber tyres and tubes increased

by 4 per cent in 2000. Other consumer durables which

increased in 2000 were glass fibre, paper and paper board,

footwear, cartons and boxes, toys, padlocks and locks and

ceramic sinks.

Intermediate Goods

Imports of intermediate goods increased by 24 per cent in 2000, due to higher volumes and prices of textiles, crude oil, refined petroleum products, fertiliser, diamonds and other intermediate goods. The value of crude oil imports

1 6 7

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

increased nearly two-fold, reflecting higher prices and

volume of imports. The volume of crude oil imports

increased from 13.5 million barrels in 1999 to 17.3 million

barrels in 2000, while the average price rose from US

dollars 19.06 per barrel to US dollars 28.77 per barrel (51

per cent) between these two years. Expenditure on other

petroleum products increased by 66 per cent. However,

intermediate goods excluding petroleum products increased

by 13 per cent parallel to the growth in industrial exports.

There was an increase in fertiliser imports due to higher

prices reflecting trends in international markets which move

parallel to the cost of petroleum.

Textile imports, with a share of 39 per cent of

intermediate goods imports, increased by 11 per cent.

Diamond imports increased by 9 per cent, responding to

recovery in the diamond and jewellery industries. Other

intermediate goods imports grew by 15 per cent, marked

by higher imports of cement clinker, inputs for soap,

garments, farm inputs and rubber based manufacturing

industries. Imports of edible oil declined considerably due

to the imposition of a surcharge on these items.

Investment Goods

Imports of investment goods increased by 11 per cent in

2000. Investment goods excluding import of three aircraft

increased by 14 per cent in 2000. Imports of transport

equipment excluding aircraft increased by 3 per cent. This

includes railway coaches (US dollars 25 million) imported

in May 2000. Imports of machinery and equipment

increased by 23 per cent largely due to the import of a

power generator valued of US dollars 84 million by a

private sector company in April 2000. Other major items

of imports were parts and accessories for industrial washing

machines, telecommunication equipment, tractors and

construction related machinery. Imports of building

materials increased by 17 per cent. Other major investment

goods imported in 2000 were instruments and equipment

used in the medical profession, meters and other equipment

used for gas and electricity supply, iron and steel, aluminum

wires, tubes and pipes.

Direction of Trade

Industrialised countries were the major destinations for Sri

Lankan exports in 2000 with a share of 74 per cent.

Developing countries had a share of 20 per cent followed

by European countries in transition with a share of 3 per

cent. Sri Lanka imported mostly from developing countries

in 2000 (share of 57 per cent) followed by industrialised

countries (share of 32 per cent) and economies in transition

with a negligible share of 0.1 per cent. The share of exports

to South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation

(SAARC) countries constituted 3 per cent of the total, while

imports formed 10 per cent of the total. The Maldives was

the most important export destination (1.6 per cent of total

exports) and India was the largest country of import origin

(8.5 per cent of total imports) in the region.

USA continued to be the largest single buyer of Sri

Lanka's exports in 2000 as well as in 1999. The market

share of USA (40 per cent) in 2000 remained unchanged

at the 1999 level. However, total exports to USA increased

by 22 per cent in 2000. Textiles and garment exports

accounted for 77 per cent of total exports to USA and grew

by 26 per cent. UK, the second largest buyer, recorded a

share of 13 per cent, followed by Germany and Japan as

the third and fourth largest buyers, respectively, accounting

for a share of 4 per cent each. Garments accounted for 79

per cent of goods exported to UK. Japan was one of Sri

Lanka's major markets for crustaceans, fish products,

machinery parts and accessories, tea, and precious stones.

Out of total exports to Germany, garments and tea

accounted for 43 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively.

Exports to CIS countries increased by 32 per cent with

higher tea exports to Russia. Western industrial countries,

as a group, continued to be Sri Lanka's largest trading

partner in 2000.

Japan remained the largest single exporter to Sri Lanka

in 2000, accounting for 9 per cent of Sri Lanka's imports.

Major imports were motor cars and other vehicles,

1 6 8

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

electricity generating sets, spare parts and woven fabrics.

India, which accounted for 8.5 per cent of imports, was the

second largest exporter, followed by Hong Kong, Singapore,

South Korea, Taiwan, UK and USA. Imports from Japan

rose by 15 per cent due to the import of 34 electricity

generators and motor vehicles. Imports from India and

Hong Kong increased by 17 per cent and 12 per cent,

respectively. Pharmaceuticals, food items such as lentils,

chillies and big onions, auto trishaws and textiles were

among the major items imported from India. Fabrics and

accessories for the garment industry were the major items

imported from Hong Kong. Petroleum gases, sewing

machines, telephone equipment, wheat, data processing

machines and parts were among major items imported from

Singapore.

Among developing countries, the market share of

Middle East countries increased from 6.2 per cent in 1999

to 8.6 per cent in 2000. The market share of Asian

countries dropped from 52 per cent in 1999 to 48 per cent

in 2000. However, imports from Asian countries increased

by 14 per cent, as a result of higher imports from India

and East Asian countries. Imports from Middle East

countries increased by 72 per cent marked by the higher

cost of petroleum product imports from Iran.

9.4 Services and Income

A significant drop in the surplus of the services account

was witnessed in 2000, mainly due to increased outflows

on transport and travel. The net surplus in the services

account declined from US dollars 147 million in 1999 to

US dollars 38 million in 2000. This was mainly a result

of declines in net receipts from transportation services and

in net travel receipts. Services receipts declined marginally

by 1 per cent, mainly due to the combined effect of a drop

of 8.3 per cent in travel receipts, as a result of an equal

drop in tourist arrivals during the year and a drop of 2.3

per cent in transshipment cargo handling, offset to some

extent by increases in freight and insurance services

receipts. Services payments registered an increase of 12 per

cent reflecting increases in transportation payments by 19

per cent and in travel payments by 11 per cent during the

year. The increase in transportation payments was reflected

in payments in terms of passenger fares, freight services and

other port related expenditure. Meanwhile, net outflows on

account of other business services increased from US

dollars 47 million to US dollars 51 million.

The deficit in the income account widened further by

20 per cent to US dollars 304 million during 2000,

reflecting both a drop in interest income on a depleted

external reserve stock and an increase in interest payments

resulting from higher interest rates. Investment income

receipts on foreign exchange reserves declined by 10 per

cent to US dollars 137 million, while interest payments on

external liabilities increased by 12 per cent during the

period under review. Meanwhile, net outflows on account

of profits and dividend payments decreased marginally to

US dollars 108 million.

9.5 Current Transfers

Despite a drop in official current transfers by 5 per cent

to US dollars 25 million, net current transfers increased by

9 per cent to US dollars 999 million due to a 10 per cent

increase in private current transfer receipts during the year.

Private transfer receipts, mainly comprising remittances by

Sri Lankan workers in the Gulf, were boosted by

compensation payments amounting to US dollars 45 million

received by Sri Lankan workers displaced during the Gulf

war. Private transfer receipts, excluding these compensation

payments in both 1999 and 2000, increased by 18 per cent

from US dollars 944 million to US dollars 1,115 million.

Increased domestic interest rates for foreign currency

deposits, an attractive exchange rate and higher incomes in

countries in the Middle East arising from high oil prices

are likely to have influenced higher private remittances

1 6 9

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

during the year. Net private transfer receipts were sufficient

to finance 47 per cent of the deficit in the goods, services

and income account in 2000, a drop from the 60 per cent

in 1999. Net inflows of official current transfers, which

consist of food and commodity grants, continued to decline

and stood at US dollars 25 million in 2000 against US

dollars 26 million in the previous year.

9.6 Capital Movements

Capital flows to emerging market economies witnessed a

resurgence with the restoration of market stability and

investor confidence after the Asian financial crises.

However, Sri Lanka could not benefit from these favourable

developments in international capital markets as reflected

in a drop in private foreign capital inflows during the year.

Net capital and financial inflows improved from US dollars

373 million in 1999 to US dollars 568 million in 2000. Net

long-term capital inflows to the government increased and

there was a turn around in net short-term capital flows from

an outflow of US dollars 142 million in 1999 to an inflow

of US dollars 88 million in 2000. However, increased

capital flows were not adequate to cover the large current

account deficit arising from the wider trade deficit. As a

result, the overall balance in the balance of payments was

a deficit of US dollars 516 million in 2000 (3.1 per cent

of GDP) in comparison to a deficit of US dollars 263

million (1.7 per cent of GDP) in 1999.

Capital Transfers

During the year, net capital transfers declined by 36 per

cent to US dollars 51 million due to a drop of 41 per cent

in official project grants. Total official capital transfer

receipts during the year amounted to US dollars 46 million

while private capital transfers amounted to US dollars 12

million. As in the past, Japan continued to be the major

donor contributing to 55 per cent of total grants during the

year.

Long-term Capital

Despite the improved global economic and financial

environment and the increased capital flows to emerging

market economies, net private long-term capital inflows to

Sri Lanka declined from US dollars 373 million in 1999

to US dollars 257 million in 2000 due to a drop in long-

term borrowing by the private sector. Foreign direct

investment inflows declined to US dollars 175 million in

2000 from US dollars 201 million in 1999.

Long-term capital inflows to the private sector

consisted mainly of the loan received by SriLankan

Airlines, amounting to US dollars 257 million to finance

the purchase of three aircraft during the year and US dollars

4.5 million received by DFCC Bank for financing its small

and medium enterprises project. With the purchase of the

three additional aircraft during the year, SriLankan Airlines

completed its current reflecting programme. Amortisation of

US dollars 129 million by SriLankan Airlines accounted for

the bulk of private capital outflows during the year. Foreign

direct investment inflows at US dollars 175 million was

lower by 13 per cent in 2000. The major sectors that

benefited from FDI inflows during the year were power (78

per cent), garments (11 per cent), port services (5 per cent),

telecommunications (2 per cent) and health services (2 per

cent). Meanwhile, FDI outflows amounted to US dollars 2

million on investment by a resident entrepreneur in a

garment factory in the Maldives. Foreign inflows in terms

of privatisation proceeds amounted to US dollars 3 million

only during the year. The privatisation programme was

postponed for 2001, in view of the prevailing uncertain

political and economic environment and an international

environment that was not conducive to divestment in the

telecommunications sector.

Long-term loan capital inflows to the government

increased by 26 per cent to US dollars 479 million. This

included long-term suppliers' credits on account of defence

imports. Long-term loan capital to the government excluding

these suppliers' credits reflected a marginal growth of one per

cent in 2000. The slow growth in project related loan

disbursements was due to a host of factors such as the

uncertain environment that prevailed in an election year,

which also caused temporary delays in project implementation,

delays in foreign aid utilisation and a general decline in the

inflow of Official Development Assistance (ODA). The

majority of the concessional aid disbursements during the year

were for power generation, telecommunications, plantations,

irrigation, education and infrastructure development. Major

projects financed by multilateral agencies during the year

included the second power systems expansion project (US

dollars 18 million), the plantation reform project (US dollars

11 million), the emergency rehabilitation of petroleum

facilities (US dollars 9 million) funded by the Asian

Development Bank (ADB), the teacher education and teacher

development project (US dollars 8 million) and the year 2000

emergency assistance project (US dollars 5 million) funded by

the International Development Association (IDA). Meanwhile,

projects financed by Japan, the major bilateral donor, included

the regional telecommunications development project (US

dollars 22 million), the Kelanitissa combined cycle power

plant project (US dollars 21 million), the telecommunications

network expansion project for Greater Colombo (US dollars

20 million) and the Mahaweli System C upgrading project (US

dollars 11 million). Gross outflows on account of capital

repayments declined from US dollars 319 million in 1999 to

US dollars 308 million in 2000. Loan repayments included the

payment of the remaining amount of US dollars 16 million of

the US dollars 50 million floating rate notes (FRN) issued in

1997. In sum, net long-term capital inflows to the government

increased from US dollars 62 million in 1999 to US dollars

171 million in 2000.

The Asian Development Bank and the International

Development Association continued to be the major

multilateral donor agencies in 2000 extending US dollars

74 million and US dollars 47 million, respectively, under

concessional project related lending. Meanwhile, Japan

continued to be the major bilateral aid donor providing US

dollars 182 million in project aid during the year. While

Japan accounted for 52 per cent of total concessional aid,

ADB and IDA accounted for 21 per cent and 13 per cent,

respectively, during the year.

Short-term Capital

Total net short-term private capital flows increased

significantly from a net outflow of US dollars 142 million

in 1999 to a net inflow of US dollars 88 million in 2000,

mainly due to an increase in foreign liabilities of

commercial banks and an increase in private short-term

trade credits.

Amidst uncertainties in the domestic economy and

rising global interest rates, foreign selling continued in the

Colombo Stock Market. Portfolio investment inflows

declined significantly from US dollars 72 million in 1999

to US dollars 19 million in 2000, while investment outflows

declined at a lower pace from US dollars 85 million in

1999 to US dollars 64 million in 2000, resulting in a net

outflow of US dollars 45 million through the share market

in 2000. Short-term capital flows to the private sector

increased from a net outflow of US dollars 10 million in

1999 to a net inflow of US dollars 100 million mainly

reflecting increased trade credits obtained by the Ceylon

Petroleum Corporation and other non-BOI enterprises.

Commercial banks' foreign liabilities increased by US

dollars 174 million mainly due to an increase in borrowing

from banks abroad by Foreign Currency Banking Units

(FCBUs), including a syndicated loan of US dollars 100

million mobilised by Bank of Ceylon as a foreign currency

loan to the government, while assets increased by US

dollars 141 million reflecting an increase in deposits with

banks abroad by domestic banking units. As a result, net

foreign assets of commercial banks declined by US dollars

33 million "in 2000.

9.7 Foreign Exchange Market

Developments

International foreign exchange markets remained relatively stable throughout the year reflecting improved macroeconomic stability in most economies although some volatility in key international currencies was in evidence during the year. Continued impressive growth in the United States strengthened the dollar against all major currencies during 2000. The Japanese yen depreciated by 11.0 per cent against the US dollar amidst growing pessimism about Japan's economic recovery. The euro continued to slide against the dollar during most of the year with an annual depreciation of 7.7 per cent, with recovery towards the end of the year. The pound sterling depreciated by 7.9 per cent during the year while the Indian rupee weakened by 6.8 per cent. The Singapore dollar remained relatively stable through the year with a depreciation of 3,9 per cent. The Korean won and the Thai baht depreciated by 10.0 per cent and 13.5 per cent, respectively, with a faster rate of depreciation towards the latter part of the year. Meanwhile, prevailing economic and political uncertainties in Indonesia and the Philippines resulted in a faster depreciation of 26.1 per cent and 19.6 per cent in the rupiah and the peso, respectively. Malaysia continued with its fixed exchange rate policy throughout the year.

A growing balance of payments deficit and the drain on external reserves to pay for it exerted heavy pressure on the Sri Lanka rupee during the year. In response, frequent adjustments were made to the exchange rate band, particularly during the latter part of the year to release pressure in the foreign exchange market by providing progressively larger scope for the market to determine the exchange rates.

The band between the buying and selling rates of the Central Bank was widened on 20 June 2000 from 5 per cent to 5 per cent with a 4 per cent depreciation in the implicit middle rate (for more information see Box 1). The wider band was expected to allow the market, to determine the exchange rate in a more flexible environment, while the fixed nature of the band was expected to bring about stability in the exchange market at least during the initial

1 7 1

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

C h a r t 9.6

E f f e c t i v e E x c h a n g e Rate I n d i c e s

stage after the introduction of the new system. That band

width continued until 3 November 2000 when it was

widened by a further one percentage point from 5 per cent

to 6 per cent with the reintroduction of the crawling band.

The growing pressure on the rupee forced the Central Bank

to widen the band again on 11 December from 6 per cent

to 8 per cent.

The rupee depreciated each time the band was widened. The market rate reached the selling rate of the Central Bank within a matter of a few days, compelling the Central Bank to use its external reserves, which were declining fast, in support of the exchange rate band. That decline demonstrated the unsustainability of maintaining the prevailing exchange rate system of a managed float, when there was a large deficit in the balance of payments and a market perception of a continued depreciation of the rupee.

The sales of foreign exchange by the Central Bank to commercial banks increased to US dollars 303.6 million from US dollars 58.2 million in 1999. Of this total, US dollars 195.1 million were sold in the second half of 2000. Purchases of US dollars by the Central Bank from commercial banks increased slightly from US dollars 0.4 million in 1999 to US dollars 2.0 million in 2000. Total interbank turnover of spot, torn and cash transactions stood at US dollars 2,259.4 million in 2000, compared to US dollars 1,933.2 million in 1999.

Overall, the Sri Lanka rupee depreciated at a faster rate of 9.9 per cent against the US dollar during 2000 as measured by the change in the Central Bank's middle rate (12.5 per cent as measured by the interbank forex market average exchange rate), compared to 6 per cent in 1999. It

depreciated against the Indian rupee (3.3 per cent), the euro (2.4 per cent) and the pound sterling (2.2 per cent). However, the rupee appreciated by 1.2 per cent against the Japanese yen due to changes in cross rates. Against the composite unit of account the SDR, the rupee depreciated by 1 per cent in 2000. Meanwhile, the buying exchange rate against the US dollar for commercial banks' transactions with customers also depreciated by 7.3 per cent during 2000 while the selling rate depreciated by 12.4 per cent.

The uncertainty in the exchange market was reflected in forward transactions. Total forward transactions during 2000 amounted to US dollars 620.4 million compared to US dollars 458 million in 1999. However, forward transactions declined significantly during the second half of the year, from US dollars 283.1 million in 1999 to US dollars 244.6 million. This was mainly due to a sharp increase in the forward premium during the second half. Market expectations of a sharp depreciation and the increase in domestic interest rates, pushed up the premia. The premium for one month as a percentage of the spot rate, increased from 4.32 per cent at the end of 1999 to 9.3 per cent at the end of June 2000 and to 17.97 per cent at the end of 2000. Similarly, the three month premium increased from 7.17 per cent to 8.05 per cent and to 15.94 per cent.

The nominal effective exchange rate of the Sri Lanka rupee against the twenty four currency basket depreciated by 6.7 per cent. However, the real effective exchange rate recorded a marginal appreciation (0.6 per cent) due to higher inflation in Sri Lanka, maintaining the country's external competitiveness in 2000.

9.8 External Assets

The rise in international oil prices, increased generation of

thermal power and unfavourable developments in the domestic

security front had a severe impact on Sri Lanka's external

assets position in 2000. The sharp increase of about 50 per cent

in international prices of crude oil and increased use of thermal

fuel to generate power required an extra expenditure of about

in gross official reserves, consisting of foreign assets held by the Central Bank and the government, by US dollars 597 million or 36 per cent to US dollars 1,043 million and an increase in gross external assets of commercial banks by US dollars 141 million (15 per cent) to US dollars 1,083 million. While the drop in foreign assets of the Central Bank was mainly reflected in a liquidation of its foreign securities holdings, the

US dollars 400 million. Additional expenditure on defence

imports was US dollars 280 million in 2000. Expectations of

a sharp depreciation of the rupee prompted delaying the

repatriation of export proceeds. Commercial banks bought

foreign exchange from the Central Bank to finance some large

corporate sector bills, particularly those of the Ceylon

Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and the Co-operative Wholesale

Establishment (CWE).

Consequently, Sri Lanka's gross external reserves declined by US dollars 456 million (18 percent) to US dollars 2,126 million at the end of 2000. This was reflected in a drop

increase in foreign assets of commercial banks was indicated in an increase in deposits held abroad by domestic banking units. Gross foreign assets of commercial banks were augmented to some extent by borrowing US dollars 100 million through a syndicated loan by Bank of Ceylon. Foreign liabilities of commercial banks increased by 23 per cent to US dollars 938 million, resulting in a drop in net foreign assets of commercial banks by US dollars 33 million. Gross official liabilities declined by US dollars 80 million after repaying US dollars 97 million to the IMF.

From 1994 onwards Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs) of commercial banks have been treated as a part of the domestic banking system in the compilation of balance of payments statistics. Accordingly, transactions involving FCBUs and non-residents are taken into account in the compilation of balance of payments statistics, while those involving FCBUs and residents are excluded.

The resulting drop in the net official reserves by US

dollars 516 million is reflected as a deficit in the overall

balance of the balance of payments. Meanwhile, total gross

external reserves of the country declined by US dollars 456

million to US dollars 2,126 million at the end of 2000. As

a result of the sharp drop in external reserves, the import

coverage of total external reserves at the end of 2000

declined from 5.6 months of imports at end 1999 to 3.5

months, while gross official reserves were sufficient to

finance 1.7 months of imports in 2000.

debt stock was entirely due to cross rate changes among

major international currencies. The Japanese yen depreciated

by about 11 per cent against the US dollar during the year.

As about 32 per cent of total external debt is yen

denominated, this led to a 3.5 percentage point drop in

foreign debt.

Medium and long-term debt consisting mainly of

concessional assistance from the ADB, Japan and IDA,

accounted for 76 per cent of the total debt stock in 2000. Total

government debt at US dollars 6,818 million dropped by 4 per

cent and accounted for 77 per cent of the total debt stock.

Meanwhile, government guaranteed debt of public corporations

and the private sector increased by 9 per cent to US dollars

1,028 million, mainly on account of external borrowings by

SriLankan Airlines. External debt of public corporations and

the private sector, not guaranteed by government, declined

marginally to US dollars 278 million. Liabilities to the IMF on

(SAF) and the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility

(ESAF) declined from US dollars 258 million to US dollars 161

million with the repayment of US dollars 97 million during the

year. As a result of these changes, the total external debt to GDP

ratio declined from 57.8 per cent in 1999 to 53.5 per cent in

2000.

The short-term debt stock of the country stood at US

dollars 575 million at end 2000 reflecting an increase of 21 per

cent. The increase was mainly due to larger suppliers' credit

to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and private

institutions. The share of short-term debt in the total debt stock

increased from 5 per cent in 1999 to 6 per cent in 2000. Rising

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

short-term debt, together with declining external assets

increased the ratio of short-term debt to external assets,

highlighting the necessity of corrective measures.

Meanwhile, total foreign liabilities including banking

sector external liabilities, at US dollars 9,935 million,

decreased marginally in 2000 due to the combined effects

of a drop in external debt and an increase in banking sector

external liabilities. The latter was mainly due to the short-

term borrowing of US dollars 100 million by Bank of

Ceylon through a consortium of foreign banks.

9.10 Debt Service Payments

Total debt service payment consisting of both amortisation

of long-term and medium term debt and interest payments

on all foreign debt, increased by 12.6 per cent to US dollars

953 million. This was the combined outcome of an increase

in interest payments by 12 per cent to US dollars 331

million and an increase in amortisation payments by 13 per

cent to US dollars 622 million. Interest payments on foreign

loans increased by 12 per cent to US dollars 326 million.

Interest payments to the IMF remained at US dollars 5

million. The rise in interest payments during 2000, was due

to higher global interest rates that prevailed during the year.

However, the impact of high international interest rates on

Sri Lanka's external debt service payments is still small as

77 per cent of outstanding foreign debt is on concessional

terms and most of these rates are not directly linked to

market interest rates. Amortisation of foreign loans,

comprising mainly concessional loans, increased by 16 per

cent to US dollars 524 million. Repayments to the IMF

declined by 2 per cent to US dollars 97 million.

Amortisation payments during 2000, included US dollars 16

million as the balance payment on account of the US

dollars 50 million FRNs issued in 1997. Debt service

payments as a percentage of receipts from merchandise

exports and services declined from 15.2 per cent to 14.7

per cent during the year. As a percentage of receipts from

goods, services income and private transfers, debt service

payments declined from 12.4 per cent in 1999 to 12.2 per

cent in 2000. Total debt service payments by the

government, at US dollars 436 million, accounted for 46

per cent of total debt service payments during the year.

9.11 External Trade Environment and Policy

Import and Export Controls

The tariff regime was simplified in 2000. The external trade

and tariff policy continued to converge towards a more

liberal and less protective regime. The tariff structure was

simplified and quantitative restrictions were further reduced.

Other distortions in the tariff and non-tariff regime were

also on the way out. These attempts were disturbed by

adhoc policy decisions taken during the latter half of 2000

to protect domestic agriculture and some industries.

Some restrictions were relaxed, with effect from 29

February 2000 by removing licensing requirement on wheat,

meslin, wheat flour, meslin flour, maize, meal of wheat and

certain items of preparations of a kind used for animal feed.

However, cut portions of motor vehicles and some selected

items of preparations of a kind used for animal feed were

brought under import licensing.

All varieties of rice and paddy were brought under

licensing to protect domestic producers against lower prices.

Furniture used in medical, surgical, dental or veterinary

professions, metal, plastic and wooden furniture and

mattress supports, articles of bedding and similar furniture

such as quilts, cushions and pillows were other items

brought under import and export control on 21 July 2000.

After these revisions, 329 items at the 6 digit level of

Harmonised System Code (HSC) remained under import

control at the end of 2000. Only four categories of exports

(i.e., coral chank and conch shells, wood and articles of

wood (ebony), ivory and ivory products and passenger

motor vehicles first registered in Sri Lanka prior to 1945)

continued to remain under licence for environmental

protection and the preservation of antiques.

Tariffs and Taxes on External Trade

In the Budget 2000, the tariff structure was further

consolidated to a two-band structure of 10 and 25 per cent,

keeping a few agricultural products under the 35 per cent

rate. The concessionary rate of 5 per cent applied on

industrial raw material and machinery not manufactured in

Sri Lanka would be gradually eliminated. Import duty on

crude oil was removed and an excise duty imposed on

finished products to simplify taxation on petroleum

products. Duty on cement was unified at 10 per cent to

encourage local value addition. The duty waiver on edible

oil was removed and brought under the tariff rate of 25 per

cent. Maize, which had been exempted, was brought under

a duty of 5 per cent with effect from 15 February 2000,

later increased to 10 per cent. Tariff on paper and paper

board was reduced from 25 per cent to 10 per cent with

effect from 30 October 2000.

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

Box 8 Sri Lanka's Competitiveness in a Global Context

Competition is the striving for superiority or supremacy

by populations that share a limited environmental

resource. Competitiveness is the ability to maintain such

superiority or supremacy. In international economics,

competitiveness of a nation is described as the ability

of a nation to maintain superiority or supremacy over

other countries in accessing international markets and

attracting capital.

During the last few decades the world has

witnessed an acceleration of technological development,

causing global competition to intensify. Advances in

information technology have allowed countries to learn

about new developments in foreign markets almost

instantly. Technological innovations and developments in

transportation have brought down transportation costs.

These developments have enabled any small nation to

advertise its products globally, access foreign markets

and attract foreign investments at increasingly low costs,

overcoming the barriers imposed by physical distance.

As distance has become less significant for economic

relations among nations, nations have been converging,

though at different speeds, to one global village.

A nation is competitive if both its firms and its macroeconomy are competitive. A competitive firm needs to be moving away from state paternalism towards exploiting its own strengths; aggressively relying on advanced factors of production, enhancing knowledge about its competitors and global consumers, while engaging in strategic co-operation and forming alliances with other firms and industry clusters. The macroeconomy needs to be made more efficient by liberalising the economy (both factor and product markets), enhancing openness to the rest of the world, redefining the role of the government, rationalising government expenditure and deficits, maintaining an efficient network of financial and physical infrastructure, enhancing acquisition of technology, upgrading research and development efforts and establishing a facilitating legal framework.

The ever intensifying competition forces nations to

make well-planned efforts to place themselves high in

global competitiveness rankings. International

organisations conduct surveys on macroeconomic

competitiveness and publish those rankings worldwide.

They use major macroeconomic features to assess

macroeconomic competitiveness. As illustrated in Table

1 www.imd.ch. and www.weforum.org

1, the major variables considered are openness,

government, finance, infrastructure, technology,

management, institutions, labour and human capital. In

2000, both the International Institute for Management

Development (IMD) and the World Economic Forum

(WEF) published their rankings of nations.1 In the list

published by IMD, the United States ranks first,

followed by Singapore, Finland and the Netherlands.

According to WEF, the top ranking country was

Singapore, followed by Hong Kong, Luxembourg and

the United States. Although rankings differ depending

on the source, the top seven nations are identical in both

sources (Table 2).

Many countries in the developing world are ranked

low in the list of competitive nations. This is due to

inherent problems across a wide frontier of issues.

Many developing countries lack resources to provide an

efficient macroeconomic environment and quality

infrastructure facilities. Absence of measures to curb

adverse selection and moral hazard problems has further

weakened the macroeconomic efficiency of developing

countries. With substantially large public sectors in

developing economies, their governments have to rely on

appointed agents to supply public goods and services

efficiently. The weaknesses in the existing incentive

mechanisms in many developing countries have allowed

the public sector to remain unduly large, unaccountable,

bureaucratic and non-transparent. Those features attract

rent seeking individuals to the public sector, while able

human capital flees developing countries. The exodus of

human capital from developing countries causes a major

problem in intelligent planning, and innovation. This

leads to lackluster investor attitudes, creating a vicious

spiral of low factor productivity and inadequate

resources and low physical and human capital leading

to low investment inflows, which in turn, lead to low

physical and human capital and low productivity growth.

Developing countries must strive to break the

vicious cycle. This could be done from two frontiers;

firms must strive for greater productivity while the

government must provide a favourable macroeconomic

environment. The goal of a firm should be wealth

creation and value addition. This is done by strategy

formulation, product development, and enhancing

productivity. The goal of a government should be to

become a neutral facilitator and an efficient provider

of public goods. This is done by encouraging the free

market mechanism, maintaining a stable and sound

macroeconomic environment, providing solutions to

1 7 8

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

adverse selection and moral hazard problems and

providing incentives for the public sector to make it

accountable, non-bureaucratic and transparent.

Developing countries could learn from the

experience of successful economies. For example,

Singapore initiated a review of its economic

competitiveness in 1996 for the next decade. A well

qualified committee reviews the economic performance

annually, and ^suggests strategies to navigate the

economy successfully in future years. In 1996

Singapore had the following set of strategies;

manufacturing and services as twin engines of growth,

strengthening access to external markets, building world

class companies, strengthening small and medium local

enterprises, acquiring human and intellectual capital,

leveraging on science, technology and innovation,

optimising resource management, and reorienting the

government as a business facilitator. The committee also

ensures that Singapore procures a high ranking in

competitiveness and it is correctly reported by

international organisations.

Developing countries could also benefit from their

development partners for advice and funds. For

example, in Sri Lanka the United States Agency for

International Development (USAID) provides funds for

developing a competitive initiative. The Commonwealth

Secretariat has undertaken awareness programmes on

competitiveness among developing countries.

As a highly trade dependent small economy,

strengthening Sri Lanka's competitiveness is crucial to

achieving high and sustainable economic growth in an

increasingly globalising economic environment.

Successive governments since Independence have been

pushing Sri Lanka's competitiveness frontier forward in

view' of global developments. Particularly, since the

commencement of economic liberalisation in 1977, Sri

Lanka's exposure to the global economy has been

widening. In this environment, sustainable economic

growth through competition has become a more feasible

option than unsustainable economic growth through

protection. This is consistent with the economic reality

that protection cannot support an industry in the long run

in a global environment when rapid technological

developments force cost of production to fall sharply.

There have been efforts to enhance productivity at the

firm level, and various programmes to help firms

develop competitive products. Macroeconomic efficiency

Box 8 (Contd,)

has been enhanced through gradual, yet partial

liberalisation of the internal market mechanism, opening

of the economy to external trade, liberalising foreign

exchange payments, liberalising the determination of the

exchange rate, enhancing infrastructure facilities,

simplifying procedures, and encouraging an investor and

export friendly environment. However, further measures

to enhance the overall efficiency are needed. In

particular, although the literacy rate is high, tertiary

education needs significant improvements to match

market requirements. Industrialists complain about the

rigidity of labour laws. The on going war has imposed

a serious fiscal burden, with serious implications on

macroeconomic efficiency and investor confidence.

Sri Lanka has.not yet entered the global ranking

process. The USAID assisted Competitiveness Initiative

(CI) in Sri Lanka is progressing toward obtaining a rank

for Sri Lanka, while assisting Sri Lanka's industries to

enhance their global competitiveness. A trial survey

conducted in 2000 has ranked Sri Lanka at 44 out of

60 countries surveyed as illustrated in Table 2%. The

survey was conducted based on the factors considered

by the WEF as outlined in Table 1. Sri Lanka ranks

above the Philippines, Peru, Turkey, El Salvador, Poland,

Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, Ukraine, India, Bolivia,

Russia, Venezuela, Bulgaria, Ecuador and Zimbabwe.

However, further improving macroeconomic stability,

strengthening economic reforms, developing

infrastructure facilities and improving political stability

are crucial in further improving the competitiveness of

Sri Lanka in the global market.

CI also helps Sri Lanka's industries to formulate a vision, long-term direction and a strategy. It provides support to formulate industry clusters, cluster meetings and conducts pilot projects to access niche global markets. Sri Lanka's industries must realise that competitiveness cannot be sustained through low wages, depreciating currency and continuing depletion of natural resources, but it should be sustained through exploiting their own strengths, enhancing knowledge and human capital, research and development, leading to innovations on all frontiers of production, raising and marketing value chain factor productivity.

to be free from all export and ad valorem sales taxes since late 1992, while export cesses and royalties on some items continued to remain. Except for steps taken to accelerate refunding, no major changes with regard to GST took place in 2000.

Very few duty waivers were granted in 2000. A full

duty waiver of 10 per cent was granted on motor cycles

imported by members of local authorities with effect from

10 March 2000. A full duty waiver of 25 per cent was

granted on vehicles imported by foreign employment

agencies. A partial duty waiver of 6 per cent for diesel-

fuel vehicles and 19 per cent for petrol-fuel vehicles which

was introduced on 22 February 1999 on imports made by

public sector employees under a special scheme was revised

to 1 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively, with effect from

14 February 2000. However, as the normal duty rate on

motor cars was reduced from 30 per cent to 25 per cent

on 15 February 2000, the duty rate applied for these

vehicles remained unchanged at 24 per cent for diesel-fuel

vehicles and 11 per cent for petrol-fuel vehicles. Under these categories 11,767 vehicles were imported and the revenue forgone amounted to Rs. 747 millions.

A partial duty waiver on copra and edible oil which had been effective from 13 January 1998 and 18 June 1998, respectively, was removed and brought under the tariff rate of 25 per cent from 15 February 2000. To provide protection to the local coconut oil industry, a surcharge of 25 percentage points was imposed on edible oil with effect from 17 July 2000 increasing the effective duty rate to 50 per cent. To protect local potato farmers a surcharge of 35 percentage points was applied on imports of potatoes for the period of 30 August to 8 December 2000.

The average import duty, i.e. the ratio of import duty collection to total adjusted imports, declined from 7.0 per cent in 1999 to 4.5 per cent in 2000, reflecting decreases in duty rates and dutiable imports. The share of dutiable imports in total imports declined from 34.0 per cent in 1999 to 29.3 per cent in 2000, reflecting the substantial increase in non-dutiable defence related imports and the reduction

1 8 1

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

in dutiable imports of intermediate goods. In the

intermediate goods category, dutiable imports declined from

24 per cent to 18.8 per cent. However, in the investment

goods category, dutiable imports increased from 38.5 per

cent to 39.7 per cent. The average duty rate on intermediate

goods dropped from 3.9 per cent in 1999 to 2.9 per cent

in 2000 partly reflecting the impact of the removal of duty

on crude oil imports on 15 February 2000. Although

dutiable imports of investment goods increased marginally,

as a result of higher imports of machinery and equipment

under duty concession facility, the average duty rate

declined from 4.4 per cent in 1999 to 4.0 per cent in 2000

consequent on duty waivers.

Dutiable imports of consumer goods declined from

56.9 per cent to 56 per cent as a result of higher imports

of pharmaceutical products and infant milk products which

are exempt from import duty. The average import duty rate

of both food and drink and non-food consumer goods

categories declined further. The major contributor to the

reduction in duty on non-food consumer goods were

imports of motor cars which enjoyed partial duty waiver.

Textiles and Garment Quota Allocation

Allocation of textiles and garment quotas under the system began in 1978 through the Ministry of Textile Industries. Since 1 July 1992, the administration of the quota system became the responsibility of the Textile Quota Board (TQB) which was initially established as an inter-agency adhoc committee. Later, in 1996, TQB was constituted as a statutory body by the Textile Quota Board Act. No.33 of 1996. However, quota restrictions are to be phased out completely by 2005 under the Uruguay Round Agreement on Textile and Clothing (Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA)). Sri Lanka submitted lists of items that it would like to have freed from restrictions under Phase I and II of MFA phasing out procedures, to the Textile Monitoring Body of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 1996 and 1998, respectively.

The objective of TQB is to ensure that quotas allocated to the country are utilised fully and efficiently. To achieve this purpose, TQB allocates textile quotas (TQ) each year among garment manufacturers, primarily on the basis of past export performance. Allocation on the basis of past performances is referred to as 'Main Quota' or 'Performance Quota' allocation. To provide flexibility, exporters who hold Performance Quota are permitted to transfer unutilised quota to exporters through TQB on a permanent or temporary basis. However, the sale or purchase of quota is not permitted. The relevant serving agency (BOI and Textile Division of the Ministry of Industrial Development) can also authorise temporary transfers within a minimum period of two working days. Performance quota holders are encouraged to surrender the

unutilised quota to TQB and credit for surrenders will be given in three phases depending on the time of surrendering. If un-utilised quota are surrendered before the period of acceptance of final quota allocation, 100 per cent of surrendered quantity will be allocated in the succeeding year. If the surrenders are made between end of the first phase to end of the fifth month (second phase) and from the six month to the eighth month (third phase), 75 per cent and 50 per cent of surrendered quota, respectively, will be credited in the following year. However, an exporter who transfers more than 40 per cent of his performance quota is liable to have his quota allocation reduced in the following year. This limit was increased from 40 per cent to 60 per cent of performance quota in 2000 and is expected to be increased to 100 per cent in 2001.

About three per cent of quota are allocated to small

quota holders who export less than 4,000 dozen pieces in

all categories on a pro-rata basis. About 50 per cent of the

quota that will be available in a year on account of growth

and flexibility provisions are earmarked for new investors

and existing manufacturers who expand their capacity with

investment in new machinery and equipment. Immediately

after the allocation of performance quota, the remaining

quota are allocated under the main pool quota scheme on

a pro rata basis based on the number of employees. In the

allocation, preference was given to exporters to non-quota

countries and exporters of non-quota items to quota

countries. The under-utilised categories in the previous year

are declared as 'cold' categories and allocated on condition

that shipment should be made within seven working days.

BOI and the Textile Division of the Ministry of

Industrial Development service TQ by issuing export

licences (export visas) against TQ. In a manner similar to

visas issued in the case of travel by persons, the export of

textiles and garments from Sri Lanka under quota system

requires a legal permit of entry, or visa. Once export

consignments are shipped under TQ, the exporters should

obtain a visa from BOI or the Ministry, depending on

whether the firm is a BOI or non-BOI entity. The visa is

issued on the submission of shipping documents to the

relevant authorities and is required by buyers to clear the

export consignments from their customs authorities.

Shipment of products against performance quota allocations

is allowed only on proof of full payment of EPF and ETF

contributions in respect of employees.

Approximately 33 quota categories were open to export

to USA while 15 categories and 4 categories were available

to Canada and EU countries, respectively, in 2000. Basic

quota availability to USA, EU and Canada rose by 11 per

cent, 16 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively. Accordingly,

overall quota availability increased by 12 per cent in 2000.

Under the flexibility provisions an additional 4.1 million

1 8 2

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

pieces were made available to Sri Lanka in 2000. However,

the overall quota utilisation rate in 2000 remained at 80 per

cent as in the previous year. The utilisation of the US quota

increased from 85 per cent in 1999 to 85.4 per cent in

2000. The utilisation of quota varied widely across different

product categories and countries. The under utilisation was

partly due to insufficient demand for particular items, and

partly due to local producers using capacity to produce high

value added garments under other quota categories or to

produce non-quota garments. This was evident in increased

exports of non-quota garment categories and full utilisation

of some popular categories. Quota allocated for certain

popular categories to USA and EU such as ladies' dresses,

shirts and blouses, women's and girls' suits, men's and

boys' shirts, men's and women's trousers and men's shorts

and breeches, overalls and shorts were fully utilised.

Despite the increase in quota from EU and Canada,

quota utilisation rates with respect to those countries was

relatively lower than in US markets. Overall utilisation rate

of EU country quota declined from 58 per cent in 1999 to

54 per cent in 2000 while the utilisation rate of quota

permitted by Canada increased from 41 per cent to 49 per

cent. The category 6 (men's and women's trousers and

men's shorts and breeches) and category 7 (women's and

girl's woven and knitted blouses) to EU and category 5

(trousers, overalls and shorts, women's shirts) and category

2 (winter outerwear) to Canada were among popular

categories and utilisation rates were significantly higher than

in less popular categories. Total exports of textiles and

garments to USA, with a high proportion of garments,

increased by 26 per cent in 2000. However, earnings from

exports to EU increased by 16 per cent, despite the lower

rate of quota utilisation, indicating a move towards non­

quota markets in EU. Earnings from textile and garment

exports to Canada increased by 44 per cent. Earnings from

exports to non-quota countries too increased by 36 per cent

in 2000 indicating signs of diversification of export markets

and a shift from quota to non-quota categories.

In 2000, Sri Lanka signed a Memorandum of

Understanding with EU to remove quota restrictions on

textile and garment exports to EU countries. In reciprocity,

Sri Lanka agreed to bind tariff rates at 0, 5,10 and 17.5

per cent for items (current rates are 0, 0, 25 and 10 per

cent, respectively). However, exporters to EU have to obtain

export visas from BOI or the Textile Division of the

Ministry of Industrial Development for the purpose of

monitoring exports while ensuring that the exported items

are produced in Sri Lanka. In addition to 4 categories,

which were under the quota, three new categories were

brought under the visa requirement in 2000.

The Electronic Visa Information System (ELVIS),

which was initiated in December 1999 to transmit key

statistics on export of textiles and garments directly to the

US Customs through electronic media, operated in 2000.

Under the earlier system, exporters had to dispatch the

documents manually to importers to enable them to clear

the goods. This practice was vulnerable to counterfeiting,

forging of signatures and illegal routing. The increasing

number of visa forgeries that took place in recent years was

identified by TQB, and Sri Lanka joined ELVIS to

overcome those difficulties.

Incentives to Exporters

The government implemented various incentives proposed

in the 2000 Budget targeting exporters as well as other

industrialists to improve competitiveness and profitability in

the sector. Venture capital companies were given an option

to move out of the ten year tax holiday granted to them

and make investments of their own choice, particularly in

priority sectors and software industries. These companies

accumulated large sums of investible funds since guidelines

limited the risk ventures in which they could invest. This

incentive was granted to invest these accumulated funds to

diversify investment activities. Special incentives were

granted to encourage the setting up of 50 information

technology training institutes in major population centers

covering all districts during the next two years. The initial

expenditure in setting up such facilities, including the cost

of training trainers, renovating and refurbishing premises

and obtaining infrastructure will be met by BOI. A five

year tax holiday was granted if they would be established

outside the Colombo District, subject to a minimum

requirement of 300 students being trained each year.

Concessions made available in the 1998 Budget to promote

software industries, will continue.

The fiscal incentive scheme, which was introduced in the 1996 Budget to encourage investment in advanced technology and to improve productivity, was extended for a further period of two years in the 2000 Budget. This scheme allowed duty free imports for new and existing companies to invest in advanced technology, while the limit on the minimum investment amount was eliminated in the 1999 Budget to benefit small industries.

Institutional Support to Exporters

Exporters continued to receive institutional support from the

Ministry of Plantations Industry (MPI), EDB and the Sri

Lanka Export Credit Insurance Corporation (SLECIC) and

other related ministries and government institutions. MPI

provided support for the development of traditional exports

while EDB played the major role in the development and

promotion of nontraditional exports. SLECIC provided

credit insurance and guarantee services. Other relevant

institutions, especially the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and

the Ministry of Internal and International Trade and

1 8 3

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

Commerce, continued to educate exporters on facilities

available through bilateral, regional and multilateral

organisations and were instrumental in establishing contact

between Sri Lankan entrepreneurs and foreign counterparts.

Private sector institutions such as Chambers of Commerce,

also provided institutional support to exporters.

The objectives of SLECIC is to issue insurance

policies to exporters and guarantees to banks and financial

institutions for the development of Sri Lanka's exports. For

the year 2000 the number of policies and guarantees in

force was 296, amounting to Rs. 1,032 million compared to

244 policies in force, at end December 1999. There were

47 new insurance policies issued in 2000, amounting to

Rs.561 million as against 37 policies in 1999. New

guarantees in force at end 2000, amounted to 249 to the

value Rs.471 million. A few insurance policies were in

place for new and small scale exporters, totalling to Rs.ll

million. A special insurance cover for tea exports to Iraq

was launched by SLECIC in 2000. Sri Lankan private

sector tea exporters under the 6"1 phase of the UN Oil for

Food Programme were granted deferred payment credit

facilities.

EDB conducted 93 programmes under its technical and

skills development programme. It organised the participation

of Sri Lankan exporters in 36 product specific and general

international trade fairs. The total value of initial export

orders received at these fairs was Rs.385 million. EDB

continued to provide advice and assistance to exporters to

resolve various operational problems relating to sea and

airfreight and entrepot trade. In collaboration with the

Customs and Ministry of Internal and International Trade

and Commerce, meetings were held to solve problems of

entrepot traders and to prepare a manual for entrepot

traders. Awareness programmes and seminars were

conducted to help develop small and medium scale

enterprises. Such enterprises were assisted with providing

information and advisory services. EDB has channelled its

resources to provide multi-faceted services to the export

sector ranging from computerised database facilities,

Bulletin Board Service, advisory service and library

facilities.

During 2000, the Chambers of Commerce held a number of seminars and discussions on various issues. Chambers also participated in monthly meetings with the Treasury, exporters and the Customs and settled several problems faced by their members.

Freight Rates

Freight rates are determined partly by the global demand and supply and the degree of competition among shipping lines. In Sri Lanka, local agents implement rates given to them by their principal shipping companies, which mostly operate abroad. Shipping lines covering destinations in Asia

continued to adopt the Freight of All Kind (FAK) system

while those covering UK, North Continent (Germany,

Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands), the Mediterranean,

France, USA and Canada adopted a commodity based

freight system in 2000 as well.

During 2000, average freight rates for several

destinations showed mixed changes. The overall average

freight rate increased over that in 1999. The average rates

to USA, Saudi Arabia and Dubai increased while those to

UK, Kuwait, Australia, Japan and Singapore fell in 2000.

The average freight rate for rubber to UK and the North

Continent increased while rates for tea, rubber tyres,

desiccated coconut, activated carbon and rubber gloves

decreased. The freight rate for garments remained

unchanged in 2000. The average freight rate for tea, coir

fibre and activated carbon to USA increased in 2000. Those

rates have had an adverse impact on exporters of

commodities such as fibre which have a lower fob value.

This will lead to out-pricing Sri Lankan fibre in the major

fibre markets in USA.

Shipping lines increased the Terminal Handling Charge

(THC) by 41 per cent in the first quarter of 1999. This rate

is again to be increased by 33 per cent with effect from

01 January 2001. However, the decision to increase the

THC is not expected to be operational for at least six

months on a request made by the Minister of Shipping.

9.12 Trade Relations, Trading and Clearing

Arrangements

Sri Lanka showed its continuing commitment to foster a

freer trade regime in 2000 by entering into an agreement

with the European Union and holding discussions on a

possible free trade agreement with Pakistan. The IndoLanka

Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed with the government

of India in December 1998 was made operational with

effect from February 2000. Sri Lanka's tariff concessions

became effective on 15 February 2000 while India

implemented the agreement with effect from 1 March 2000.

Exports of tea and garments under the agreement

commenced in April 2000. Under this agreement the quota

for 2000 for tea was limited to 11.25 million kg while the

quota for garments was limited to 6.67 million pieces, of

which a minimum of 5 million pieces were to be

manufactured in Sri Lanka out of fabric of Indian origin.

A single product category could not exceed the limit of 1.5

million pieces.

Utilisation of the tea quota in 2000, remained very

low. Sri Lanka exported 459.2 metric tons of tea to India

under FTA, 4 per cent of the total allocation. The major

reasons for lower exports were restrictions of entry points

for tea exported under FTA to Cochin and Calcutta, higher

prices of Sri Lankan tea compared to Indian tea, severe

1 8 4

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

competition from other well established brands and Rules

of Origin criteria that prevented the export of blended tea

under FTA. Garment exports in 2000 under FTA was not

very encouraging either. Garment exports were limited to

a few sample shipments carrying a few hundred pieces.

Imposition of specific duty on garment items, restrictions

on entry points to two ports, Rules of Origin restriction,

lack of promotional efforts to popularise Sri Lanka's

exported items in India were the main factors for lower

exports.

Exports to India under FTA amounted to US dollars

9.2 million, which was 17.7 per cent of total exports to

India from March to December 2000. Among those items,

waste paper and copper scrap accounted for 46.5 per cent

and 18 per cent, respectively, while tea accounted for 12

per cent. New items exported to India under FTA included

memory modules, marble, rubber slippers, pharmaceutical

products, processed food products, ice cream machines,

plastics and mattresses.

Imports from India amounted to US dollars 600 million

in 2000 an increase of 17 per cent. Imports of goods, which

are on Sri Lanka's negative list, (i.e. imports for which no

tariff concessions were granted) amounted to US dollar 180

million, an increase of 32 per cent, while items which are

not included in the negative list, increased by 11 per cent

to US dollars 331 million during March-December 2000.

BOI approved 7 foreign investment projects and was

expected to approve 3 more projects under FTA. Under two

existing foreign investment projects there were plans to

expand production lines to cater to the vast Indian market.

Total investment in these projects amounted to US dollars

86 million.

Sri Lanka signed a Memorandum of Understanding

(MOU) on trade in textiles and clothing products with EU

on 5 December 2000. This step will remove all quantitative

restrictions currently on textile and garment exports from

Sri Lanka to EU by January 2001. As existing quota

restrictions on Sri Lanka's textile and garment items are

expected to be removed fully by 2005, this will help

exporters to build confidence and diversify and expand

capacity to compete in a freer market.

Sri Lanka entered into several bilateral agreements in

2000. The agreement on Trade, Economic and Technical

Co-operation ratified with Ukraine will grant 50 per cent

reduction of import tariff on Sri Lanka's tea exports to

Ukraine. Sri Lanka held bilateral discussions with Iran, in

which issues relating to blending of Sri Lankan tea with

Iranian tea aiming at CIS countries on a barter basis,

extension of credit facilities on tea purchased by Iran,

transfer of technology from Sri Lanka in the manufacture

of tea, co-operation in oil, gas and petrochemical industries

and establishment of a Trade Council were considered.

Discussions covered other areas, including co-operation in

tourism, health, education, and the finalisation of the draft

Merchant Shipping Agreement that had been submitted to

the Sri Lankan authorities in July 2000.

Sri Lanka had discussions on Joint Committees for

Trade and Economic Co-operation with China and Thailand.

Possibilities of bilateral trading arrangements were discussed

with Norway, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa,

Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Georgia, Moldova,

Armenia and Belarus. In 2000, several delegations from

Europe and Asia visited Sri Lanka while delegations from

Sri Lanka visited Iran, Egypt and Thailand.

Regional economic co-operation was fostered further in

2000 with continuing discussions with SAARC, Bangkok

Agreement, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka,

Thailand-Economic Co-operation (BIMST-EC) and Indian

Ocean Rim Association for Regional Co-operation (IOR-

ARC)

The senior officers' meeting of the SAARC countries was held in Colombo during 13 -15 November 2000. Member countries of the South Asian Preferential Trade Agreement (SAPTA) brought down the limit of the domestic value addition requirement from 50 per cent to 40 per cent. Least developed country members in SAARC were given a further concession of 10 per cent. The European Union recognised SAARC as a regional grouping for the purpose of extending 'Cumulative Rules of Origin' to member countries of SAPTA. This decision was effective for the fulfilment of Rules of Origin Criteria under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) from 1 October 2000. This was an outcome of negotiations member countries of SAARC and SAARC Secretariat had with EU to obtain special concessions for its members on the local content requirement under the 'Cumulative Rules of Origin' criteria for the grouping. Under this criteria, material imported from SAARC member countries and used in

1 8 5

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

production in any member country could be considered

'local material' in deciding the local content requirement.

Sri Lanka continued to receive tariff concessions from the

participating developed countries of GSP, without

reciprocity. However the direction of exports under this

scheme did not show any significant change in 2000.

The second meeting of BIMST-EC Trade and

Economic Ministers Meeting was held on 27 April 2000.

The ministers agreed to establish an expert group to prepare

a concept paper on possible approaches towards a

Preferential Trading Arrangement leading to a free trade

area in the region.

An Extraordinary Meeting of IOR-ARC was held in

Muscat, Oman in January 2000. Membership of IOR-ARC

was increased to 19 with the inclusion of Bangladesh, Iran,

Seychelles, Thailand and UAE. Japan and Egypt as dialogue

partners, while applications of the People's Republic China

and UK as dialogue partners were accepted. The working

Group on Trade and Investment also met on this occasion.

The Indian Ocean Rim Business Forum (IORBF) and Indian

Ocean Rim Academic Group (IORAG) met in July 2000

in Maputo, Mozambique.

The 16l h Session of the Standing Committee of the

Bangkok Agreement was held in Bangkok, from 3 - 5 April

2000. At this meeting decisions were taken to revise the

Bangkok Agreement in order to widen product coverage

and deepen tariff cuts under the Agreement. The committee

also accepted the accession of China to the Bangkok

Agreement. Pakistan, Fiji, Mongolia and Vietnam also

responded to the membership expansion programme.

The first South Summit of the Group of 77 was held

in Havana, Cuba from 10-14 April 2000 with the

participation of 133 developing countries. The fourth

meeting of the Ministers of Trade and Economics of the

Group of 15 (G-15) was held in Cairo, Egypt on 15 June

2000. The Trade Ministers of G-15 had discussions on the

economic environment and trade development prospects and

exchanged views on the Third World Trade Organisation

(WTO) Ministers Conference and the 10* United Nations

Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD -X). In

the discussion on the matters on the Third WTO Ministerial

Meeting, Trade Ministers expressed serious concerns about

non-fulfilment of commitments undertaken by developed

countries in the Uruguay Round Agreements and on

decisions such as those on Special and Differential

Treatment, provisions in favour of developing countries and

technical assistance. Ministers also expressed concern on

deliberate attempts to include labour standards and

environmental issues in trade negotiations. Ministers agreed

to increasingly co-operate in matters concerning WTO

issues and to conduct regular consultations among

themselves. G-15 members also discussed measures

including a preferential trading arrangements for the

promotion of intra-G15 trade. The Ministers emphasised the

importance of concluding bilateral investment agreements

and agreements for avoidance of double taxation among the

G-15 countries in order to promote investment and the

transfer of technology among G-15 countries.

Under Sri Lanka's commitments made to WTO, the Inter Ministerial Sub Committee made some progress. According to the decision of the General Council for Trade in Services, negotiations mandated by Article XIX of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) on services were launched in February 2000. In 2000, the sub committee on GATS engaged itself in a preliminary assessment of potential areas for liberalisation of services in Sri Lanka. The review of Article II Most Favoured Nations (MFN) Exemptions under the GATS Council for services was conducted successfully in respect of Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka's obligations under WTO in relation to the Telecom sector was closely monitored, to ensure conformity with specific commitments made in this sector.

Agricultural negotiations was launched in WTO.

Hence, the Inter Ministerial Sub Committee on Agriculture

worked on evaluating Sri Lanka's position and assessing

implications of multilateral negotiations concerning

agriculture in Sri Lanka, widening the membership of the

sub-committee on agriculture and expediting the completion

of notification obligations for 1998/1999.

The Technical Committee, appointed by the Inter

Ministerial Sub-committee on Anti Dumping, Subsidies and

Countervailing Duties and Safe-Guard Measures, to examine

the proposed draft Anti Dumping and Countervailing Duties

Bill, prepared a revised draft of the Bill. With the assistance

of an expert from WTO, a final text of the draft bill was

prepared and approved by the main Inter Ministerial Sub-

Committee. It is being presented to the Cabinet of Ministers

and to Parliament.

9.13 Internal Trade and Institutional Arrangements

Internal trade was conducted in a relatively free market

environment with minimum state intervention in 2000.

Major controls and interventions were limited to trade

regulations while state intervention in price determination

was limited to a few essential items. Interventions were

justified as preventing harmful effects arising from anti

competitive practices such as collusive price fixing,

dumping, predatory pricing and formation of monopolies

consequent upon large mergers. Government made a few

attempts to eliminate drastic changes in prices in response

to supply fluctuations. Those interventions were carried out

by the Ministry of Internal and International Trade and

Commerce and Ministry of Food and Marketing

Development and its marketing organisations, the Co­

operative Wholesale Establishment (CWE), Lanka Salu Sala

1 8 6

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

Limited and the Ministry of Co-operative Development

(MCD) and the Co-operative Development Department, the

General Treasury, and the State Pharmaceutical Corporation

of Sri Lanka (SPCSL). The two regulatory bodies attached

to the Ministry of Internal and International Trade and

Commerce, viz., the Department of Internal Trade (DIT)

and Fair Trading Commission (FTC), maintained price

controls on pharmaceutical products and probed unfair

trading practices.

Government intervention in the supply of petroleum

fuel and wheat flour continued in 2000. Throughout 2000,

Ceylon Petroleum Corporation was the sole authority to

produce and supply petroleum fuel, except lubricants and

LP gas, which latter was monopolistically supplied by Shell

Gas Lanka Ltd. The monopoly power enjoyed by Shell Gas

Lanka Ltd. expired in December 2000 allowing other

competitors to enter the market. Until February 2000, the

Food Commissioner's Department (FCD) of the Ministry of

Food and Marketing Development acted as the sole

authority in the purchase and distribution of wheat flour,

milled by Prima Ceylon Ltd. Only large-scale manufacturers

of biscuits and other flour-based products were allowed to

import wheat flour to meet their raw material requirements.

In February 2000, the licensing requirement on the import

of wheat and meslin and wheat and meslin flour was

removed and the private sector was allowed to import them

without any restrictions. With this development, the private

sector imported 34,706 metric tons of flour but wheat was

imported only by CWE. FCD conducted its operations in

collaboration with CWE and MCD outlets. FCD also

ensured that adequate quantities of rice and sugar were

released to the market to avoid any supply shortages.

On many occasions, CWE functioned to ensure fair

prices to both producers and consumers while attempting

to achieve the dual objectives of market stability and its

own financial viability. To ensure supply and price stability,

CWE continued to purchase essential consumer goods in

bulk quantities locally as well as import them in times of

shortage. CWE intervened in the paddy market by

purchasing 88,629 metric tons of paddy during the year

when there was a surplus of rice in the market due to high

imports of rice in the last quarter of 1999 and the bumper

harvest in Maha. Furthermore, when potato production

increased from 27,200 metric tons in 1999 to 48,400 metric

tons, local purchases of potatoes by CWE increased from

203 metric tons in 1999 to 1,687 metric tons in 2000. CWE

limited its imports of potatoes to 450 metric tons.

After the removal of licensing requirements on

essential food items in 1996, CWE's share in essential food

imports declined further in 2000. CWE abstained from

importing dried chillies while reducing the import of other

products as the private sector imported sufficient quantities

to meet the demand. When the harvest of big onions and

chillies declined by 26,100 metric tons and 1,000 metric

tons respectively in 2000, CWE limited its domestic

purchases of big onions to 2,166 metric tons when

compared with 2,625 metric tons in 1999, while its

purchase of dried chillies was reduced to 146 metric tons

from 299 metric tons. The import of big onions also

declined from 6,280 metric tons in 1999 to 4,887 metric

tons in 2000. As a result, CWE' s share in big onion

imports declined from 7 per cent to 4 per cent, while the

share of potato imports declined from 0.6 per cent to 0.4

between 1999 and 2000. However, CWE imported 10,500

metric tons of wheat flour in 2000, to build up depleted

buffer stocks.

CWE continued to distribute essential food items at

reasonable prices through 152 retail shops and 42 wholesale

shops, which included 3 new retail shops in 2000. The total

turnover was Rs. 8,090 million, an increase of 18 per cent

from Rs. 6,836 million reported in 1999. Franchise shops

recorded a turnover of Rs. 2,282 million in 2000, a 35 per

cent increase over 1999. This increase was a result of

mobile sales introduced in 1998 where goods are supplied

to the franchisee's doorstep. In 2000, mobile sales

accounted for 49 per cent of total franchise shop turnover.

The franchise network was expanded with the appointment

of 193 new franchise dealers.

Other marketing institutions such as Lanka Salu Sala

Ltd. and Lanka General Trading Company Ltd. also

engaged in providing standards for quality and prices of

important consumer goods. They played an effective role,

in ensuring fair competition. The co-operative societies also

intervened in the market through the purchase of paddy

during the harvesting period and through retail sales. They

purchased 9,000 metric tons of paddy using the 1,032 co­

operative society network to stabilise domestic prices, while

601 metric tons of various other food items such as big

onions, dried chillies, gram, cowpea, vegetables and fruits

were purchased during the year. To ensure providing quality

milk products to the consumer, 284 co-operative societies

maintained 97 outlets to sell milk products, while engaging

in purchasing milk production from 66,880 farmers.

Government influenced the supply of essential goods by

granting duty waivers and making tariff changes.

SPCSL continued to be the sole supplier of

pharmaceutical products to government health care

institutions and a major supplier to the market. SPCSL

supplied pharmaceuticals at prices fixed by FTC. All private

sector imports of pharmaceuticals were subject to licensing

and price controls. This is an area where government

intervention is necessary to ensure the quality of the

products. At the same time it is necessary to eliminate

government monopoly to improve efficiency in this trade

and to reduce the high costs of health care. DIT and FTC

were engaged in ensuring the orderly conduct of trade in

1 8 7

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

a free market environment. Those two institutions made

considerable efforts to enhance consumer awareness of their

rights, promote the formation of consumer groups to protect

consumers, establish fair trading practices, regulate internal

trade and maintain price controls when required.

DIT acts under the provisions of the Consumer

Protection Act (CPA), Fair Trading Commission Act

(FTCA), Price Controls Act (PCA) and directions issued

under CPA. It also implements the provisions under the

Fertilizer Regulations Act No.68 of 1988. Imported

pharmaceuticals were subject to price controls with the

maximum retail price of imported drugs fixed at cif value

plus 75 per cent, for the private sector and cif value plus

54 per cent, for SPCSL. These mark ups include the

National Security Levy, profit margins for wholesalers,

retailers and SPCSL and overheads charges. In 2000, DIT

carried out 1,539 raids and 1,003 offenders were prosecuted.

The DIT also received and investigated consumer

complaints on the irregular imposition of GST. The Fair

Trading Commission Act No. 01 of 1987 granted powers

to FTC to make inquiries. Since there was a duplication of

functions between FTC and DIT, and in order to create a

stronger institution to probe trading practices, a proposal

was made in 1997 to amalgamate the two institutions. The

Bill for the establishment of a Consumer Protection

Authority by amalgamating the two institutions is yet to be

presented to the Parliament.

9.14 Tourism

Despite strong economic growth in countries which are

major sources of tourists to Sri Lanka, frequent and more

flights between Colombo and major sources of tourist traffic

to the country and promotion campaigns carried out by the

government and the private sector, the tourism sector

suffered a major setback in 2000. Tourist arrivals continued

to slowdown throughout the year, except in February 2000.

Tourist arrivals at 400,414 in 2000 were 8 per cent lower

than 1999. Reflecting the impact of lower tourist arrivals,

gross earnings from tourism declined from US dollars 274

Western Europe continued to be the major source of

tourists to the country, accounting for 65 per cent of

arrivals. The number of arrivals from this region dropped

by 5 per cejit in 2000. Lower arrivals from France,

Germany, Italy and the Netherlands contributed to this fall

significantly. More tourists arrived from Belgium, Finland,

UK, Sweden and Switzerland. UK continued to lead the

number of tourists for the second consecutive year,

surpassing Germany, which was the largest source of

tourists in 1998. Arrivals from Asia decreased by 20 per

cent with a low turnover from both East and South Asia.

Arrivals from East Asia dropped by 22 per cent with a 37

per cent decline in tourists arriving from Japan. Tourists

from South Asia declined by 18 per cent with a 25 per cent

drop in the arrivals from India. Tourists arrivals from

Australasia and Eastern Europe grew by 20 per cent and

10 per cent, respectively while arrivals from North America

declined by 6 per cent.

The average duration of stay (ADS) of tourists in the

country dropped marginally from 10.3 days in 1999 to 10.1

days in 2000. However, the impact of reduced ADS on

earnings was more than offset by an increase in the average

spending of a tourist per day from US dollars 61 to US

dollars 62.50 in 2000. The slight drop in ADS was mainly

due to a decline in the ADS of German tourists. The

average stay of tourists from Finland was 13.4 days

followed by tourists from Austria (12.5days), the

Netherlands (12.4 days) and Germany (12.0 days).

Of total arrivals, 74 per cent travelled on regular inter­

regional flights, 19 per cent arrived in regular intra-regional

flights and 7 per cent on charter flights. SriLankan Airlines

brought in 51 per cent of the total number of tourists in

2000 compared to 47 per cent in 1999. The addition of

three new aircraft to the fleet each year in 1999 and 2000

contributed to the increased share of SriLankan Airlines,

especially during the peak season.

Vacation continued to be the main purpose of arrivals

in 2000, accounting for more than 90 per cent of'total

arrivals. The remainder was for business, visiting friends

and relatives and religious and cultural purposes.

Confirming Sri Lanka's potential for developing new

tourism products such as eco-tourism and culture tourism,

revenue from tourists visiting wild life parks, botanical

gardens, zoological gardens and the cultural triangle

continued to increase in 2000. The Sri Lanka Convention

Bureau continued to promote meetings, incentive travel,

conventions and exhibitions (MICE) tourism in 2000. The

Bureau sponsored 21 conferences and exhibitions in 2000.

The Bureau participated in several international campaigns,

promoting Sri Lanka as a destination for MICE tourism.

Following the drop in arrivals, foreign guest nights in hotels decreased by 10 per cent while the occupancy rate

decreased by 9 per cent. Occupancy rates in all major

regions fell.

The number of hotel units in the graded accommodation sector increased from 173 to 207 in all regions. The increases.were in Colombo City (19 to 23), Greater Colombo (33 to 40), South Coast (72 to 83), East Coast (2 to 4), Hill Country (10 to 14) and Ancient Cities (37 to 43). With the increased number of hotel units, room capacity grew from 12,918 to 13,311. A new tourist hotels code was introduced in 1999, replacing the Hotels Code of

1973, with the main objective of ensuring and maintaining standards required by the industry. Under the new code it became compulsory for all tourists hotels to register with the Ceylon Tourist Board (CTB). However, star classification of hotels remains optional.

Direct employment increased by 4 per cent to 37,943 while indirect employment increased from 51,184 in 1999 to 53,120 in 2000. Direct employment is employment in hotels and restaurants, travel agencies, airlines providing recreational facilities, tourist shops and the Tourist Board. Indirect employment is generated by domestic producers and suppliers of inputs, manufacturers and suppliers of handicrafts and others.

The Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation (MTCA) signed seven bilateral agreements on Air Traffic Rights with UK, Indonesia, Australia, the Netherlands, India, Bangladesh and Yemen to increase flying frequency per week in 2000. The number of charters operated in 2000 remained unchanged at 8 as in 1999.

International and regional associations play a vital role in promoting tourism. There were five conferences in Sri Lanka in 2000: Universal Federation of Travel Agents Association (UFTAA) World Conference 2000, Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) Board Meeting 2000, Indian Association of Tour Operators Annual Convention 2000, Association of Independent Tour Operators - UK Annual Overseas Conference 2000 and World Tourism Organisation Executive Council Meeting.

Tourism was taken as one of the key areas for bilateral and regional co-operation in many forums recently. Sri Lanka was selected as the lead country in tourism in the BIMST-EC in 1998. Possible regional co-operation in tourism was one of the prominent areas discussed at the second meeting of BIMST-EC Trade and Economic Ministers held in New Delhi, on 27 April 2000. Encouraging intra-regional travel, investigating tourism promotion opportunities, developing new tourism products and developing projects for environmental management and cultural preservation were the areas earmarked for improvement by BIMST-EC group. At the first session of the Sri Lanka-Thailand Joint Commission for Economic and Technical Co-operation held in Bangkok from 2 - 4 June 2000, expansion of joint tourist promotional efforts on Buddhist tourism, health tourism and cultural tourism were considered as some of the key areas for co-operation and collaboration between the two countries. At the sixth session of the Sri Lanka-Iran Joint Commission held in Tehran from 22 - 25 July 2000, co-operation in tourism was among the major areas of importance to both parties.
