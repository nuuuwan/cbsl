Yet, due to resource constraints, both financial and personnel, services have failed to match the rapid growth in demand, leading to a decline in the quality of services over the years. Along with changing life styles, economic progress and technological improvements, the type of demand for health services has changed dramatically. With increasing income levels and greater awareness, people demand higher standards and more sophisticated health services. The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on Health Policy identified these issues and recommended a wide range of health sector reforms. The implementation of PTF recommendations was slow during 1998 and 1999, but gathered momentum in 2000. Diseases such as dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), Japanese encephalitis (JE), which have increased to epidemic proportions due to poor environmental conditions, threatening the country's health conditions in recent years. The intensity of the DHF out-break was serious during 2000. This re-emphasised the need for allocating sufficient resources for preventive health care services, through the budget, as the private sector does not normally involve itself in such activities. Currently, the private sector provides over 50 per cent of the curative health care needs of the country. Hence, by fortifying the private sector with an effective regulatory mechanism to increase its share in curative health care, the public sector would be free to divert more funds for financing preventive health care facilities in the country.",

These qualities are reported to be lacking in many students who complete the current educational programmes. The educational reforms that are being implemented are expected to address these issues so that the mismatch between educational attainments and labour market requirements could be minimised. General educational reforms, which were introduced in 1998 on a pilot basis in the Gampaha District, were extended to the whole island in 1999. According to an 'Independent Review of Progress in Educational Reforms in the Western Province' by the Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Education, students and teachers, as well as parents, have responded positively to these reforms. However, a lack of awareness of reforms among some reform executors has been identified as one of the factors which hinder its effective implementation. In addition, shortages and delays in receiving educational materials by schools, poor infrastructure facilities, inadequate financial resources and a lack of competence among teachers also hinder the successful implementation of reforms. Disparities in the distribution of available resources and information have also been observed. These problems were more severe in outlying districts than in the Western Province. Therefore, it is necessary to take early steps to correct any misalignment in the reform process in order to achieve good results.",

The large unmet demand for higher education continues to exist mainly because of the scarcity of resources to expand higher education facilities of the state and barriers to entry by the private sector. In an effort to address these issues, a new tertiary education strategy was planned during the year. The University Grants Commission (UGC) recognised two institutions, viz., the Sri Lankan Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT) and the Naval and Maritime Academy (NMA) as degree awarding institutions, under the Universities Act. The Institute of Technology at the University Of MoratUWa was also established in 2000. Meanwhile, the technical education and vocational training sector expanded further, in line With the recommendations made by the Presidential Task Force on Tertiary Education and Vocational Training.",

    "text": "In 2000, the energy supply was adversely affected by reduced hydropower generation and a turbulent crude oil market. The demand for electricity and petroleum products grew by 9 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively. The drought that prevailed in the catchment areas severely affected hydropower generation. Except in October, water storage in reservoirs remained below 50 per cent. The water storage of reservoirs, which was 44 per cent of capacity at the beginning of 2000, dropped continuously to about 16 per cent by mid year, compelling the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to resort extensively to expensive thermal power generation. As the installed thermal power capacity was insufficient, CEB had to hire several power plants from the private sector, which further increased generation costs. The electricity tariff was increased by an average of 6 per cent with effect from June 2000 but this was not sufficient to cover escalating costs of generation. As a result, CEB faced severe financial difficulties towards the end of 2000. Meanwhile, in the petroleum sector, the average import price (c&f) of crude oil increased sharply by about 50 per cent, to an average of US dollars 28.30 per barrel in 2000. This situation initially led to a substantial deterioration in the financial position of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), as there was no in-built flexibility in the revision of local prices to adjust for changes in petroleum import prices. This forced CPC to depend heavily on bank borrowings to finance its operations. However, in order to reduce losses of CPC, the government allowed increases in local prices of petroleum products on four occasions during 2000.",

The present demand for electricity will double to around 9,600 GWh by 2010. At present, hydropower is the main source of commercial energy in the country. Although the cost of generating hydro power is relatively low, high dependence on hydropower is risky, as hydropower generation is highly vulnerable to weather conditions. In addition, almost all economically sound and environmentally acceptable major hydropower sources have been harnessed over the last two decades. In response to these supply constraints, dependence on thermal power was increased from 21 per cent in 1990 to 35 per cent in 2000 (Chart I). As the price of oil rose sharply in 2000, there was a substantial increase in the cost of electricity generation, leading to deterioration in the CEB's financial condition because power tariffs had not been adjusted in time to cover the cost Belatedly, CEB was compelled to impose a surcharge on all electricity consumers to cover the additional cost arising from the increase in oil prices. The cost of electricity is likely to vary in line with changes in the international oil prices, which have again began to fluctuate widely. High electricity costs, adversely affect the cost of living and reduce the external competitiveness of producers, particularly of exporters. Maintaining low electricity prices comparable to those in other countries is essential as 75 per cent of the export industries are highly dependent on electricity. There is no option other than to shift to alternative low cost power sources.",

In addition, all identified hydro projects, which are to be developed, are not economically viable and even if developed, would be inadequate to meet future demand. Further, development of hydro resources is also constrained by threats to the environment arising from construction of reservoirs. These problems include soil erosion, silting of reservoirs and the inundation of fertile.lands to construct reservoirs.",

During the last 13 years, coal prices have remained between US dollars 44.50 (in 1985) and US dollars 28.79 (in 1999) per metric ton, a declining price trend, despite rising demand for coal (Chart II).

The share of hydro power is expected to decrease to 32 per cent. The balance will be met by thermal power generation.

    "text": "The relative advantage of coal power when compared with other sources of power generation, such as liquefied natural gas, wind power, solar energy, wave energy, bio-mass, geo - thermal energy and saw dust is quite clear. Wind power is an option for Sri Lanka and a wind power plant of 3 MW was commissioned as a pilot project in Hambantota recently. Wind energy, however, is available only in limited areas and the cost of installation is high. Given present technology, solar energy is expensive for large-scale electricity generation but could be economical in remote areas, where extending the national grid is expensive. Application of other forms of renewable energy sources such as geo-thermal energy, bio-mass, wave energy and sawdust, are at demonstration stage. They could play an important role in decentralisation of electricity generation to meet electricity needs of rural and remote areas.",

Oil prices started to rise in world markets as the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decided to cut oil supplies by 2.1 million barrels per day with effect from April 1999. Subsequent increases in oil production had little impact on the market due to the growing world demand caused by expanding economies, particularly in North America and East Asia. The average import price, which was around US dollars 25 a barrel in January 2000, rose to around US dollars 33 a barrel by October 2000. The total expenditure on petroleum imports more than doubled to US dollars 901 million, accounting for about 12 per cent of the country's total import bill.

In comparison to prices in the previous year, diesel, kerosene and furnace oil prices were increased by 86 per cent, 77 per cent and about 100 per cent, respectively in 2000. However, the price of petrol, which was priced significantly above cost, was not revised with a view to rationalising the prevailing anomalous price structure. CPC operations in 2000 resulted in a large loss of approximately Rs.15 billion, which compelled it to depend heavily on bank credit to meet its financial obligations. This had an adverse impact on financial markets, exerting upward pressure on market interest rates. These problems emphasise the need for a flexible pricing system for petroleum products, which would lead to the adjustment of local prices in line with price movements in international markets. The sharp increase in oil import expenditure exerted severe pressure on the balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves of the country.",

Auto diesel sales to the transport sector recorded a lower growth of 5 per cent in 2000, compared to the 12 per cent increase in the previous year. Meanwhile, petrol sales increased by 5 per cent, following a 4 per cent rise in 1999. Kerosene sales dropped by 6 per cent in 2000.

    "text": "Local sales of liquefied petroleum gas (LP gas) have shown a steady growth in recent years, as it is increasingly used for cooking purposes and for running petrol vehicles after conversion to LP gas. The latter was increased by the substantial price differences between petrol and LP gas. According to the Consumer Finances and Socio-economic Survey 1996/97 of the Central Bank, the proportion of households using LP gas for cooking purposes had increased to 10.8 per cent by 1997 from 2.6 per cent a decade ago. However, the growth rate of LP gas consumption decelerated significantly in 2000. This was a result of a nearly zero growth in the domestic sector, due perhaps to the price increase of 58 per cent during the year, and a relatively slower growth of 9 per cent in the industrial sector. Meanwhile, LP gas consumption in the auto gas sector increased sharply by 33 per cent. In 2000, Shell Gas Lanka Ltd (SGL) imported 133,598 mt and purchased 16,104 mt of LP gas from CPC to meet the local demand. Meanwhile, the monopoly status enjoyed by SGL expired on 08 December 2000, paving the way for greater competition in the supply of LP gas to the domestic market.",

The rolling stock of Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) was also modernised with the purchase of 15 new power sets. However, as rail fares were not revised, the increase in diesel prices and other operating expenses had an adverse impact on SLR, which led to a further increase in its losses.",

    "text": "With the intention of increasing the public sector share in the passenger transport sector to about 60 per cent, from the present 40 per cent, RTCs continued to expand their fleets and operations. The bus fleet of RTCs, the average number of buses operated per day and the operated kilometerage all increased. As a result, the share of RTCs in the passenger transport sector, in terms of operated kilometres, increased from 39 per cent in 1999 to 43 per cent in 2000. These developments, together with the upward revision of bus fares, helped RTCs to improve their financial position and reduce losses in 2000. Bus fares were raised on two occasions in 2000, in February and in June, by 15 per cent each. The full impact of the passenger fare increase in September 1999 by 15 per cent was also experienced in 2000. In addition, revenue leakage was reduced by establishing a more efficient ticket checking system, which helped improve the revenue of RTCs. Total revenue of RTCs rose significantly by 30 per cent, while operating expenditure increased by 20 per cent. Consequently, the loss of RTCs in 2000 dropped by 11 per cent. The total revenue of RTCs included a sum of Rs. 575 million received from the Treasury to compensate for losses from operating bus services on uneconomic routes. The total number of employees in all RTCs increased by 1,895 to 38,125 during the year. However, the average number of employees per bus declined to 7 in 2000 from 8 in 1999, as the number of buses operated per day increased in 2000.",

The addition of 15 power sets in 2000 relieved the situation to some extent. Towards the end of 2000, SLR introduced 25 additional train services; 6 trains on the main line, 6 trains on the coastal line, 4 trains on the Kelani Valley line, 5 trains on the Puttalam line and 4 trains on the Northern line.

The main objective of this project is to improve the health and well being of one million people living in Anuradhapura, Hambantota, Kalutara, Kegalle, Moneragala and Puttalam districts by improving water supply and sanitation facilities and providing education on hygiene. Under this project, the strategies used for the supply of drinking water in rural areas were the installation of tube wells and dug wells, protection of springs and direct supply of pipe borne water. The Towns South of Colombo Water Supply Project, which commenced in 1997, was also in progress with funds provided by JBIC. Under this project, water supply schemes in the Homagama and Kesbewa areas were commissioned during 2000. The total capital investment under the project during 2000 amounted to Rs.460 million. A population of 260,000 will benefit once the project is completed. In addition, the Towns North of Colombo Water Supply Project funded by JBIC, the Eastern Coastal Area Water Supply Scheme funded by the Australian government and the Greater Kandy Water Supply and Environmental Improvement Project funded by JBIC were continued during 2000. In addition to these major projects, NWSDB executed a project to establish tube wells in rural areas, providing benefits to about 35,000 people.",

In addition, the Programme intends to promote a balanced growth in order to reduce disparities within a district as well as between districts. Since 1989 the programme has focussed its attention on the involvement of the private sector in employment and income generation in the rural areas, strengthening participatory approaches for the disadvantaged rural people and decentralisation. From 1997, the IRDP was reoriented towards a Regional Economic Advancement Programme (REAP). REAP is formulated with the objective of reducing regional disparities, poverty alleviation and providing more equitable opportunities for people living in all parts of the country.",

    "text": "The Ministry of Forest and Environment (MFE) is primarily responsible for formulating environmental policies at the national level, while the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) functions as the regulatory authority. The private sector is also involved in environmental projects in a limited way, while NGOs play a significant role. The MFE implemented several programmes in 2000, aimed at conservation and management of the environment. A national policy on air quality management has been developed under the Clean Air 2000 Action Plan. Accordingly, vehicle emission standards, fuel quality standards and vehicle importation standards were gazetted in 2000. The Ministry prepared a three-year action plan to mitigate adverse environmental and health impacts of the use and disposal of plastics. Under the plan, the Ministry is also studying possibilities of introducing degradable plastics as a substitute for non-degradable plastics. Uncontrolled sand mining in rivers, particularly mining at inappropriate locations, is a serious environmental problem. The MFE has embarked on a study to find ways and means of mitigating the adverse environmental impact of sand mining, while providing the continuous supply of sand needed for the construction industry. In order to prevent pollution of waterways, the MFE initiated a pilot project called the 'Pavithra Ganga' programme to keep water bodies clean, with the co-operation of the respective local government authorities. Solid waste management has been a perennial environmental and social problem, especially in urban areas. With a view to finding a permanent solution for this, the MFE has prepared a National Strategy for Solid Waste Management and a three-year action plan, along with pilot projects. The national strategy covers waste avoidance or reduction, reuse, recycling and final disposal of residual waste in an environmentally sound manner. Coral mining, which leads to loss of bio-diversity and coastal erosion, is a serious environmental problem in the coastal areas. In order to avoid coral-based lime production, the MFE took initiatives to introduce an improved kiln, with the help of the Industrial Technology Institute (ITI), to produce good quality lime from dolomite.",
