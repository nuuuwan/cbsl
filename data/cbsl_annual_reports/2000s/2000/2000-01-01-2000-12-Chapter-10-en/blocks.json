For over two decades prior to that change, financial repression and policy distortions obstructed the emergence of efficient domestic financial markets. Excessive government intervention impeded the development of an efficient and a viable financial system in the country. Financial reforms implemented in Sri| Lanka during the past two decades were intended tol create an efficient, competitive and developed financial. system, while strengthening financial sector stability.

In the latter part of the 1990s policy makers, both in Sri Lanka and in the rest of the world, became more cautious in further liberalising capital markets, learning from adverse developments in the East Asian crisis. However, one of the fastest growing segments in Sri Lanka's economy in recent years has been the financial sector. This is manifest in developments in",

With the relaxation of controls in the sector, the regulatory framework has been strengthened to be compatible with international standards. New regulatory standards based on guidelines provided by the Basle Agreements were introduced into the banking sector. Prudential guidelines were introduced in the areas of capital adequacy, liquid assets, loan loss provisioning, and single borrower limits. The regulatory and supervisory functions of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka were strengthened by giving it legal powers under banking sector legislation to carry out its functions effectively. An extremely important legislative enactment in this regard was the Banking Act, which consolidated other legislation and put in place a legal framework for the banking sector. The Banking Act provided for the introduction and operation of procedures for the licensing of persons carrying on banking business, for the regulation and control of matters relating to the banking business and for other matters connected with the banking business. In view of the need to ensure the smooth functioning of the financial system, as well as to safeguard the interests of depositors, a legal framework for regulating finance companies was formed and legislative enactments introduced giving powers to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to regulate and supervise finance companies. Legislation was also passed to facilitate debt recovery procedures of commercial banks. Moreover, a Credit Information Bureau and a Credit Rating Agency were established. These were expected",

As nominal interest rates rose, real interest rates increased towards the latter part of the year, as inflation continued to be relatively low. Despite over-subscriptions at most auctions in government securities, yields on Treasury bills and bonds tended to rise, partly reflecting higher inflation expectations.",

Similarly, rates on 1-year fixed deposits denominated in sterling rose from a range of 3.50-6.75 per cent per annum to 4.40-7.75 per cent per annum during the same period.

However, demand for funds under the reverse repo facility remained high reflecting the tight liquidity situation in the money market. Consequently, the Central Bank provided substantial amounts of rupee liquidity to the market through its reverse repo window. The margin between the Central Bank's buying and selling rates for the US dollar was widened from 2 per cent to 8 per cent during the year to provide greater flexibility to the market and reduce pressure on external reserves.",

Although the very nature of these transactions makes measurement difficult, it has been estimated that the annual turnover of the illegal drug industry alone was around US dollars 400 billion, or 8 per cent of all global trade, in 1997. As money laundering involves not only drug trafficking, but also arms dealing, gambling and other such activity, the actual sums involved would be much greater. This sheer magnitude of the problem is one of the reasons that has compelled international groups such as the Financial Actions Task Force set up by the Group of 10 and the UN International Drug Control Programme to address themselves to combating the problem of money laundering. < ~",

However, those who wish to launder money are more concerned with 'cleaning' their funds than in obtaining the best returns. Thus, they would even invest in enterprises with sub optimal returns so long as their funds could be laundered. On a macro scale, this would be reflected in large flows of money to countries which had lax regulations with regard to money laundering, even if such countries had unsatisfactory macroeconomic conditions, such as an over valued exchange rate, high fiscal and trade deficits and high inflation. Thus, the normal market forces, which would encourage the development of efficient organisations and the maintenance of viable macroeconomic conditions in countries, would no longer operate. The signals emanating from the market would appear to reward weak economic policies. Hence, the primary advantage of a free market, viz., the efficient use of resources, would be lost.",

Among them was the expansion of the scope of the New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme to include pre-harvest and post-harvest handling and processing activities. In the past, the Scheme provided financing facilities only for the cultivation of paddy and subsidiary food crops. Under this new arrangement, farmers, farmer organisations, traders and people based companies who entered into forward sales agreements became eligible to obtain loans under the extended scheme on the same terms and conditions as cultivators. The NCRCS continued to provide loans for paddy and subsidiary food crops utilising funds of the participating credit institutions, backed by an interest subsidy from the government. The interest rate applicable to on-lending under the scheme remained at 12 per cent per annum in spite of the increasing interest rates in other sectors of the economy. The Agricultural and Agrarian Insurance Board offered an insurance package to farmers who enter into forward sales contracts to cover the total loan amount obtained and the total income expected from cultivation of covered crops such as paddy, other food crops, fruits, flowers and coconut.",

    "text": "'Social capital' or the force that emerges through the synergic power of a group of people has recently been identified as an integral element of sustainable social and economic development. Social capital refers to the interactions, norms and behavioural ethics among individuals who establish self-help groups, networks and organisations to achieve goals, which are of mutual benefit to them. Social capital is not just the sum of the institutions that underpin a society, but the glue that holds them together. It emerges through association of people, i.e., family members, relatives, neighbours, friends, peer groups and members of social and professional associations. This social binding has an effect on community productivity and its well being. Hence, social capital does not exist when individuals are taken separately, but exists when individuals strive hard as a team with oust and mutual understanding towards achieving a common goal. Social capital, therefore, shapes the quality and quantity of social interactions, thereby enabling people, especially poor people, to survive day to day hardships when they are unable to do so individually. In essence, social capital, which refers to the norms and networks that enable people to act collectively, has of late risen to prominence as an effective tool of social and economic development (see Das Gupta, P. and Seragildin, I., 1999). However, not all economists agree on the usefulness of the concept.",

    "text": "The importance of social capital can be viewed from different angles. From the viewpoint of a community, social capital tightens social units, thereby reducing costs of family businesses and increasing family incomes to a certain extent. It adds more value to education, health, sanitation, sports, entertainment, social virtues and cultural practices. Social capital and poverty alleviation programmes also have a close relationship with each other. The higher the incidence of poverty, the higher the necessity for building social capital. In such situations, social capital acts as a safety net and the voice of the poor communities. Social capital, in turn, creates synergic power among groups of people who attempt to achieve common goals by forming firms, associations, networks, societies (death benefit societies, co-operative societies, thrift and credit societies, farmers' societies, women's societies etc.). It is therefore a factor contributing to economic development, whilst reducing the imbalance between the rich and the poor. However, the of impact of social capital depends upon the economic, social and political environment of a country.",

Mainstream economics usually emphasises the possibility of increasing productivity of human capital through division of labour and specialisation, but does not recognise the positive aspects of social interactions. Instead, social capital is often viewed as exploitative, burdensome, anti-systemic and therefore irrelevant, looking only at the negative aspects of social interactions. However, it has been proven through experience of programmes implemented in developing countries that social capital is more crucial and closely connected to poverty reduction programmes. It has further been observed that such programmes are far more successful with social capital at grassroots level than programmes without social capital and with a top-down approach.",

During that period, successive governments and non\u00adgovernmental organisations {NGOs) in Sri Lanka were given funds for launching poverty alleviation programmes. A leading NGO, the Sarvodaya Movement, under its Village Adoption Programme extensively used social capital to combat poverty in areas where poverty was an acute problem. Subsequently, various NGOs conducted similar programmes with local and international funds for the supply of credit and other services. As the sustainability of donor funded programmes depends on the availability of financial resources, the necessity arose for developing a suitable sustainable poverty alleviation programme with special emphasis on providing credit facilities to the poor through the formal banking system.

Their objective was providing funds for farm requirements and services including good quality seed, fertiliser, agro-chemicals, agro-technology, and support services and financial assistance for small farmers, who form 40 per cent of the total farming community. FBSs are expected to improve the living standards of the target groups by increasing farm income and encouraging the savings habit among the farmers. As at end 2000, 452 FBSs had been established at Agrarian Services Centres (Govi Jana Kendra) with 160,172 shareholder farmers, who were required to buy at least 1 share of Rs.100 in FBSs. The share capital of FBSs stood at Rs.16 million as at end December 2000. Savings of the individual farmers stood at Rs.24.5 million, out of which Rs.18 million was mobilised during the year under review. During 1999/2000 Maha and 2000 Yala seasons, loans to the value of Rs.49.2 million and Rs.41.2 million, respectively, were disbursed for paddy and cash crops. FBSs intend to expand credit facilities to other sectors such as livestock, inland fisheries, food processing and marketing of agricultural products.",

In comparison, total assets of commercial banks rose by 18.7 per cent in 2000 and 13.8 per cent in 1999. Finance company assets amounted to around 5 per cent of the assets of the domestic banking units of commercial banks. The growth rate of deposits of FCs was also lower (9 per cent) than that of commercial banks (14 per cent) in 2000. The slower expansion of assets/ liabilities of FCs may be attributed to the decline in fixed deposits of FCs by 5 per cent from October 2000 to December 2000. The high rates offered on risk free government securities would have contributed significantly to this development. Total outstanding credit extended by FCs also grew at a lower rate (11 per cent) than the rate of commercial banks (17 per cent) in 2000.",

In addition to specialised leasing companies, many commercial banks and other financial institutions such as licensed specialised banks, finance companies and merchant banks also engaged in leasing activities, indicating a widened scope for leasing activities in Sri Lanka. A noteworthy development relating to the leasing industry that took place in 2000 was the establishment of a regulatory framework for the leasing industry, a long felt need. The Finance Leasing Act, No.56 of 2000 was passed in August 2000 giving powers to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to regulate and supervise finance leasing institutions. Under the new Act, licensed finance institutions and public companies incorporated under the Companies Act, with a minimum issued share or paid up capital as stipulated by the Central Bank, will be able to engage in leasing after obtaining Central Bank approval.",
