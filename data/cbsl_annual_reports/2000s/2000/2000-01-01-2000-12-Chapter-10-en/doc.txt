10. FINANCIAL SECTOR

10.1 Monetary Policy

Given the pressure on interest rates from increased public

sector borrowing and the pressure on the exchange rate

from a wider balance of payments deficit, monetary policy

in 2000 focused attention on maintaining stability in money

and foreign exchange markets and on preventing the build

up of demand fuelled inflationary pressure. Increased

borrowing by the government and public corporations to

finance a larger budget deficit and operational losses,

respectively, competed for the financial resources in the

domestic market, pushing up interest rates. Meanwhile,

adverse developments in the external sector, which exerted

pressure in the foreign exchange market, had considerable

influence on the conduct of monetary policy in the second

half of the year. Consequently, the monetary policy stance,

particularly in the second half of the year, was one of

tightness. The Central Bank raised its main interest rates,

viz., the Bank Rate, the repurchase rate, and the reverse

repurchase rate on several occasions during that period.

The framework for the conduct of monetary policy was

based on monetary targeting with reserve money as an

intermediate target. The Bank continued to rely on several

measures in assessing the tightness of the policy stance,

including growth in monetary aggregates, monetary

conditions index (MCI) and interest rates. Open market

operations (OMO) continued to be the major policy

instrument. The repurchase rate and the reverse repurchase

rate were used to signal the direction of the policy stance.

At the beginning of the year, there was some

improvement in the liquidity situation following the re-flow

of currency that had been withdrawn by the public towards

the end of 1999 due to market uncertainties generated by

the Presidential Election, the Year 2000 issue and seasonal

factors. As market liquidity improved and the declining

trend in inflation continued, the repurchase rate was reduced

by 25 basis points to 9.00 per cent in January 2000. In

order to assist mopping up of excess liquidity, the Bank

temporarily reduced the margin between the primary market

yield on Treasury bills and its discount rates from 15 basis

points to 5 basis points on 13 January 2000. This was

reversed on 18 January following the successful absorption

of liquidity. Until May, interest rates in many market

segments tended to decline owing to some improvement in

the liquidity conditions.

With the country placed on a war footing in May 2000, government borrowings increased, causing interest rates to rise. A deterioration in the balance of payments, and a consequential decrease in domestic rupee liquidity, also exerted pressure on interest rates. The large deficit in

the balance of payments generated pressure in the foreign

exchange market, leading the Central Bank to increase its

interest rates to stabilise this market. The Central Bank

raised its rates on several occasions from May. The

repurchase rate, which is the rate at which licensed

commercial banks and primary dealers can invest their

surplus rupee funds in Treasury bonds and Treasury bills

held by the Central Bank, was increased progressively from

9.50 per cent at end June to 17.00 per cent at end

December. Similarly, the reverse repurchase rate, which is

the rate at which licensed commercial banks and primary

dealers can obtain rupee funds from the Central Bank

against the collateral of Treasury bills and bonds, increased

* by 500 basis points from end June to December, to end the

year at 20.00 per cent. The Bank Rate, which is more an

indicative rate of Central Bank policy direction than an

operational rate, was also increased on three occasions, by

200 basis points each on 02 October and 08 November and

another 500 basis points on 21 November 2000, to a level

of 25.00 per cent at the end of the year.

The Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) in respect of rupee

deposit liabilities remained unchanged at 11 per cent.

However, the SRR on foreign currency deposits not placed

abroad, which stood at 11 per cent, was removed with

effect from 04 August 2000. The removal of the SRR on

foreign currency deposits was intended to improve the

foreign currency liquidity of commercial banks and reduce

their intermediation costs. It may also have assisted in

attracting foreign currency deposits by enabling banks to

pay more attractive rates.

The Bank continued to provide liquidity to the market

through its reverse repurchase window. Commercial banks

and primary dealers had heavy recourse to this facility

following the shortage in market liquidity, particularly in

the second half of the year.

In view of the market distortionary nature of Central

Bank refinance, the Bank continued to refrain from granting

refinance under the Medium and Long Term Credit Fund

(MLCF). Total refinance outstanding under the MLCF

declined from Rs.2,929 million at end 1999 to Rs.2,863

million at end 2000. However, refinance granted to failed

finance companies increased by Rs.50 million with the

settlement of a claim related to a previous year.

10.2 Money Supply

Monetary growth has been stable, at around 13 per cent,

despite growth in domestic credit, due to the reduction in

net foreign assets of the banking system. The annual growth

rate of consolidated broad money (M 2 b), which includes

Reforms for Financial Sector Stability and Efficiency

A large number of countries have been reforming their

financial sectors in recent years. The theoretical basis for

those reforms originated with the financial liberalisation

paradigm introduced by Mckinnon and Shaw (1973),

who argued that financial repression in developing

countries had retarded economic growth by reducing

efficiency in resources allocation. Hence, financial

reforms in emerging economies have focussed mainly on

relaxing administrative controls, moving towards more

market oriented systems that are considered to be more

efficient, and strengthening stability in the financial

system. The results of the reforms have not been

uniform. Some countries have had reform programmes

which have been successful in removing the elements of

financial repression; several have suffered financial

distress; and the rest have had mixed results. Success

has been uneven, depending upon policy consistency,

strengths in the implementation process and real sector

situations. One clear lesson that has been learnt is that

reforms are not a one time event but are an ongoing

process. — * -

Economic stagnation, together with a repressed financial sector, were causal factors in the move towards market oriented policy reforms in Sri Lanka in 1977. For over two decades prior to that change, financial repression and policy distortions obstructed the emergence of efficient domestic financial markets. Excessive government intervention impeded the development of an efficient and a viable financial system in the country. Financial reforms implemented in Sri| Lanka during the past two decades were intended tol create an efficient, competitive and developed financial. system, while strengthening financial sector stability. The , track record is encouraging, despite slow progress in some areas and a few setbacks due to civil strife and external events. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the pace of reforms was rapid. However, after 1983 some slowdown was evident as domestic unrest compelled the government to shift the focus of attention away from economic reforms, including financial reforms. In the latter part of the 1990s policy makers, both in Sri Lanka and in the rest of the world, became more cautious in further liberalising capital markets, learning from adverse developments in the East Asian crisis. However, one of the fastest growing segments in Sri Lanka's economy in recent years has been the financial sector. This is manifest in developments in

money and capital markets, where the volume of

transactions has expanded considerable and degree of

sophistication has grown markedly.

The most significant features of the comprehensive

financial reforms that have been introduced since the

latter part of 1977 have been to open to private sector

participation areas that had been closed to them,

encourage competition, free interest rates from

administrative control, relax exchange controls,

implement institutional reforms, place greater emphasis

on market orientation in monetary management and

credit allocation and strengthen the legal, accounting and

regulatory frameworks for financial institutions.

In the first phase, interest rates were allowed to be

determined by market forces. Interest rates offered by

the National Savings Bank (NSB) had been the main

determinants of market rates. These rates, which were

heavily influenced by government and kept at relatively

low levels, were permitted to increase. Interest rates in

the primary Treasury bill market were made market

based by auctioning bills, beginning late 1980s. As a

result, yield rates on Treasury bills became a leading

indicator for changes in the interest rate structure of the

country. Refinance facilities from the Central Bank were

phased out gradually, while interest rates applicable to

such facilities from other sources moved towards market

rates. " *

The exchange rate regime moved from a fixed exchange rate to a managed floating rate system, with market forces being allowed a gradually increasing role in determining exchange rates. Exchange control regulations were relaxed to a large extent. Trade and payments systems were liberalised. The relaxation in exchange controls on trade and services culminated in Sri Lanka accepting obligations under Article VIII of the IMF Articles of Agreements in March 1994. At present, not only is the current account fully liberalised, but many capital account transactions have also been deregulated. Rules governing foreign ownership of financial institutions have been greatly liberalised.

The banking sector, which had been rigidly controlled, was liberalised. Foreign banks were encouraged to enter the Sri Lankan market and were permitted to open branches in Sri Lanka. In addition, the domestic private sector was also allowed to engage in commercial banking. New types of financial institutions,

1 9 1

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

e.g. money brokers, venture capital companies, merchant

banks and unit trusts, were permitted to commence

operations. In view of their impact on the stability of

the financial sector, certain large financial institutions,

which undertook some banking functions, were given the

special designation of Licensed Specialised Banks and

brought under the regulatory and supervisory authority

of the Central Bank. The removal of barriers to entry

broadened the financial market, and increased efficiency

through competition.

The two state banks were recapitalised and granted

greater autonomy in their commercial operations in order

to restore their financial viability and profitability. The

activities of the National Savings Bank were made more

market oriented and its capital base was restructured

The National Development Bank (NDB) was privatised

and government share ownership in the two development

financial institutions, i.e., NDB and DFCC Bank, was

sold to the public.

The vital importance of stability in the financial sector has been well understood. With the relaxation of controls in the sector, the regulatory framework has been strengthened to be compatible with international standards. New regulatory standards based on guidelines provided by the Basle Agreements were introduced into the banking sector. Prudential guidelines were introduced in the areas of capital adequacy, liquid assets, loan loss provisioning, and single borrower limits. The regulatory and supervisory functions of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka were strengthened by giving it legal powers under banking sector legislation to carry out its functions effectively. An extremely important legislative enactment in this regard was the Banking Act, which consolidated other legislation and put in place a legal framework for the banking sector. The Banking Act provided for the introduction and operation of procedures for the licensing of persons carrying on banking business, for the regulation and control of matters relating to the banking business and for other matters connected with the banking business. In view of the need to ensure the smooth functioning of the financial system, as well as to safeguard the interests of depositors, a legal framework for regulating finance companies was formed and legislative enactments introduced giving powers to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to regulate and supervise finance companies. Legislation was also passed to facilitate debt recovery procedures of commercial banks. Moreover, a Credit Information Bureau and a Credit Rating Agency were established. These were expected

Box 9 (Contd.)

to help market participants to take better informed

decisions, thereby improving the stability in the market.

Another area in which significant reforms took

place was in the implementation of monetary policy. The

Central Bank reduced reliance on direct intervention

policy instruments and placed more emphasis on indirect

market based policy instruments in monetary

management. The primary and secondary markets in

government debt have been developed, enabling the

Central Bank to adopt open market operations as its

primary tool of monetary policy. Reliance on the

statutory reserve requirement for monetary management

was gradually reduced. Directed credit allocation, which

prevailed for a long period, was replaced with market

based credit allocations. Banks became free to determine

their lending portfolios. Subsidised credit facilities were

phased out by reducing the amounts provided under

refinance facilities and by raising the applicable interest

rates to take account of costs in financial markets.

Legislative provisions were made to improve the

government debt securities markets. The Monetary Law

Act, Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance and

Local Treasury Bills Ordinance were amended to

promote the establishment of a scripless government

securities system, to create more market oriented

Treasury bonds and to increase the efficiency of the

secondary market in government securities. A system of

dedicated Primary Dealers was established to promote

the market. Many measures were been taken to develop

the equity market. Non-nationals were permitted to

invest freely in the Colombo stock market through Share

Investment External Rupee Accounts (SIERA).

Repatriation of dividends, capital gains and sales

proceeds were freed of controls. The capital gains tax

on share investments was abolished. Foreign ownership

of licensed stock broking firms, commercial banks and

insurance companies was permitted upto 100 per cent,

60 per cent and 90 per cent of issued share capital,

respectively. The trading and payments system in the

Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) is now fully automated

The introduction of an Over the Counter Market and a

Debt Securities Board at the CSE is designed to further

strengthen its activities. The CSE recently introduced a

number of changes to existing listing rules in order to

encourage the listing of companies.

Reforms are a continuous process. Although the financial sector in Sri Lanka has undergone significant reform in the past two decades or so, as conditions change and the domestic and international environment

1 9 2

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

evolve, reforms will continue. Similarly, existing high

ratios of non-performing loans and the continuation of

high financial intermediation cost clearly indicate the

necessity for further reforms. Hence, these are being

considered in many areas. » * .

To re-inforce the stability of commercial banks, the

regulatory system is being improved. The risk weighted

capital adequacy ratio has been raised from 8 per cent

to 9 per cent and is to be increased to 10 per cent in

2002. Approval has been granted to domestic

commercial banks to issue debentures to augment the

capital base of domestic banks. The focus of supervision

is changing from the traditional methods to risk based

analyses. Amendments are proposed to the Banking Act

to make it more effective by providing for the

enforcement of the core principles formulated by the

Bank for International Settlements in Basle. An

Insurance Law was recently enacted to provide for the

establishment of a Statuary Insurance Board with powers

to register insurance companies and brokers for the

purpose of developing, supervising and regulating the

insurance industry. The Finance Leasing Act was passed

recently to give powers to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

to regulate and supervise finance leasing institutions. TTie

regulatory system for other financial institutions, such as

merchant banks, is also being strengthened and brought

in line with international standards. The Monetary Law

Act (MLA) will be amended to make price stability and

financial system stability the Central Bank's primary

objectives. Additionally, the proposed amendments to the

MLA will give greater flexibility to the Monetary Board

operations of domestic banking units (DBUs) and foreign currency banking units (FCBUs) declined slightly from 13.4 per cent in 1999 to 12.9 per cent in 2000. A gradual decline was also observed in the moving average of the rate of growth in M 2 b , which declined from 14 per cent in January to 12 per cent in December. The growth rate in narrow money (Mj), which fluctuated within a range of 4.0-11.7 per cent, recorded a growth of 9.1 per cent at end December.

The major contributory factor for moderation in monetary growth was the decline in net foreign assets (NFA) of the banking system. Reflecting the significant deficit in the balance of payments, NFA of the banking system declined from Rs. 102.1 billion to Rs.69.5 billion from December 1999 to December 2000. Net foreign assets of the monetary authorities declined sharply by Rs.31 billion, largely due to the sale of foreign exchange to commercial banks and the settlement of foreign public debt.

in monetary operations and management to adopt to

changing conditions.

A further area requiring continuing reform would be the state commercial banks. As these two banks still account for over 50 per cent of assets in the commercial banking sector, their operations have a significant impact on the stability and efficiency of the sector. Steps in this direction have already been taken with the revitalisation of their operations and the recruitment of highly experienced senior management. The Central Bank is also in the process of being re-organised to concentrate its operations on the core objectives and increase efficiency. »

These measures are expected to go a long way

towards promoting a robust financial system and vibrant

economy, while helping the Sri Lankan financial sector

to keep abreast of changes in global financial conditions.

However, it should be borne in mind that reforms are a

process, and as conditions change, further reforms would

be called for.

Meanwhile, the NFA of commercial banks declined by Rs.1.2 billion. Net foreign assets of DBUs of commercial banks increased, while those of FCBUs declined. The increase in NFA of domestic units was due to increased investments with banks abroad. Net foreign assets of FCBUs decreased, partly due to the obtaining of a foreign syndicated loan of US dollars 100 million, which was subsequently on lent to the government.

Domestic credit expanded substantially, recording a growth of 27 per cent. Credit to all sectors, viz., government, public corporations and the private sector, increased, with particularly high growth in credit to the public sector. Credit to government from the banking system increased significantly as revenue receipts were less than expected, the privatisation process was delayed, increased defence expenditure was incurred and interest costs rose. Net credit to government (NCG) from the Central Bank and commercial banks rose by Rs.53 billion.

NCG from the Central Bank amounted to Rs.45 billion and

was reflected in an increase in the Bank's holdings of

government securities and increased provisional advances.

The Central Bank's holdings of Treasury bills and bonds

increased by Rs.42 billion. Increases in loans, overdraft

balances and import bills discounted were the main

components of the increase in NCG from commercial

banks. The government obtained a foreign currency loan of

US dollars 100 million from FCBUs, while repaying US

dollars 42 million of the syndicated loan of US dollars 100

million obtained in 1998.

Credit extended to public corporations increased by

Rs.25 billion during the year in comparison to the increase

in credit to corporations by Rs.3.0 billion during 1999.

Credit obtained by three major public corporations, i.e., the

Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), the Ceylon Electricity

Board (CEB) and the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment

(CWE), accounted for the bulk of the increase in bank

credit to this sector. Large increases in international prices

for petroleum products and wheat, increased use of thermal

power in place of deficient hydro power and inadequate and

delayed adjustment in domestic prices were factors that led

to public corporations increasing their bank borrowings.

Thus, public sector borrowing (i.e., government and public

corporation borrowings) rose by Rs.78 billion (73 per cent),

amounting to 142 per cent of the monetary expansion in

2000.

Credit to the private sector increased by Rs.38 billion

from December 1999 to December 2000, a growth of 12

per cent as against 11 per cent in 1999. In contrast to 1999

when credit from FCBUs declined, credit extended by both

domestic banking units and FCBUs to the private sector

increased in 2000. The increase in credit was mainly to the

services, commercial and manufacturing sectors. Higher

domestic lending rates, with the rise in interest rates in

international markets and volatility in the domestic foreign

exchange market, dampened the demand for foreign

currency credit towards the latter part of the year.

Reserve money increased by Rs.4.7 billion (4.7 per

cent) during 2000 in comparison with an increase of Rs.7.6

billion (8.2 per cent) in 1999. Although Central Bank

holdings of government securities increased substantially by

Rs.41 billion and provisional advances rose by Rs.4 billion,

reserve money increased only modestly, mainly on account

of the sharp decline in NFA of the monetary authorities by

Rs.31 billion. A major component of the monetary liabilities

of the Central Bank, currency in circulation, increased by

Rs.3 billion in 2000 as against Rs.10 billion in 1999 and

Rs.7 billion in 1998.

The money multiplier, which was 4.26 per cent in

December 1999, increased to 4.60 per cent in December

2000. The increase was mainly due to the removal of the

SRR on foreign currency deposits referred to above, and

the decline in the currency to deposits ratio. The velocity

of money increased marginally from 2.59 per cent in 1999

to 2.60 per cent in 2000.

10.3 Financial Survey

Beginning from 1999, the Central Bank has commenced

compiling a financial survey on an experimental basis. This

covers not only licensed commercial banks, but also

licensed specialised banks and finance companies. With the

expansion of the financial sector, the impact of the

operations of financial institutions other than licensed

commercial banks on the economy increases. Thus, it

becomes necessary to broaden the definition of money to

encompass these activities as well. The financial survey,

therefore, defines a broader concept of money (M 4) than

the consolidated broad money ( M 2 b ) derived from the

monetary survey. Based on the financial survey, the broad

monetary aggregate (M 4), which includes consolidated broad

money supply (M 2 b) and activities of other financial

institutions (OFIs), (i.e., Licensed Specialised Banks and

finance companies) indicated a point to point expansion of

12.9 per cent at end December 2000, a marginal reduction

from the growth of 13.0 per cent recorded at end December

1999. The monthly point to point increases in M 4 were in

a range of 11.0-13.3 per cent during 2000. As in the case

of consolidated broad money (M a), the reduction in the

value of net foreign assets offset the expansionary effect

of the growth in domestic credit and dampened the growth

in money supply.

A substantial growth was seen in net credit to the

government. In addition to the net credit extended by the

monetary authorities and commercial banks, credit from

licensed specialised banks and finance companies increased

by about 13 per cent as these institutions increased their

holdings of government securities in view of the high return

on these. Credit to public corporations too increased

significantly. However, the increase in credit came entirely

from the commercial banking sector.

The point to point growth in private sector credit in

the financial survey was moderate, at 11.2 per cent at end

December 2000, slightly lower than the private sector credit

growth in the consolidated monetary survey (11.8 per cent).

The corresponding growth rates at end 1999 were 12.0 per

cent and 10.5 per cent, respectively. The slower growth in

private sector credit in the financial survey was attributed

to the slower growth of credit from licensed specialised

banks, particularly the two development financial institutions

viz., National Development Bank (NDB) and DFCC Bank.

10.4 Interest Rates

A general rise in the interest rate structure was observed, particularly after the first quarter of 2000, in contrast to a downward movement with reduced volatility in 1999. The main causes were increased public sector borrowings, a reduction in rupee liquidity consequent upon a significant deficit in the balance of payments and tightening of the monetary policy to contain pressure on the exchange rate. As nominal interest rates rose, real interest rates increased towards the latter part of the year, as inflation continued to be relatively low. Despite over-subscriptions at most auctions in government securities, yields on Treasury bills and bonds tended to rise, partly reflecting higher inflation expectations.

Short-term Interest Rates

The gradual increase in the interest rates during the year

was clearly reflected in the interest rates in the call market.

In the first few weeks of the year, an inflow of liquidity

was seen as the market settled down following the

uncertainties in December 1999 associated with the

Presidential Elections and the Y2K problem, together with

the usual seasonal inflow in January. This caused a -

reduction in call market rates in January. Further, liquidity

was added to the market with the increase in provisional

advances from the Central Bank to the government and the

transfer of Central Bank profits to the government in

January and February. Call market rates increased slightly

towards the end of March as the New Year season

approached, and fluctuated within a range of 9.00-14.50 per

cent in the first quarter of 2000.

Thereafter, rates began to rise faster, with the usual

seasonal increase in April, increased public sector

borrowing, reduction in liquidity consequent upon the deficit

in the balance of payments and tightened monetary policy.

Call rates moved in a range of 9.50 per cent to 16.75 per

cent in the second quarter and in a range of 10.00 per cent

to 15.87 per cent in the third. Rates were highest in the

fourth quarter, varying between 14.50 per cent and 32.00

per cent.

Repo and reverse repo rates, which are the Central

Bank's signalling mechanism to indicate the expected

direction of interest rates in the market, continued to

influence market rates, particularly in containing the lower

and upper ends of call market rates. With continued low

inflation and a stable exchange rate at the beginning of

2000, the overnight repo rate was reduced by 25 basis

points in January, and maintained at that level until May.

Similarly, the reverse repo rate was reduced by 18 basis

points in January and 30 basis points in April, following

the downward trend in inflation and interest rates in the

government debt securities market. After May, however,

with the market interest rates rising to reflect increased

public sector credit demand, and the Central Bank

tightening monetary policy to stabilise the foreign exchange

market, both the repo rate and the reverse repo rate

gradually rose. By end December, the repo rate had risen

by 800 basis points to 17.00 per cent and the reverse repo

rate by 700 basis points to 20.00 per cent.

Following the usual seasonal pattern, yields on

Treasury bills declined at the beginning of 2000. The yield

on 91-day Treasury bills, which was 11.79 per cent at end

1999, fell to 11.26 per cent in January, its lowest level in

2000. Similarly, the yield on 364-day bills fell from 12.29

per cent at end 1999 to 11.93 per cent in March 2000.

Rates began to rise thereafter with a particularly sharp

increase in the second half. Yields on 91-day bills increased

by 42 basis points in the first half and 556 basis points in

the second half to end the year at 17.77 per cent. Yields

on 364-day bills increased by 24 basis points in the first

half and 521 basis points in the second half, to end the year

at 18.22 per cent.

The Central Bank's discount and rediscount rates

moved with market rates. Accordingly, the 91-day discount

rate rose from 11.64 per cent at end 1999 to 17.72 per cent

at end 2000, while the 91-day rediscount rate increased

from 14.29 per cent to 21.27 per cent during the same

period. The Central Bank also adjusted the margin between

its discount rate and rediscount rates to assist its open

market operations. In order to mop up excess liquidity in

January, the margin between the primary market yield on

Treasury bills and the discount rate was reduced temporarily

from 15 basis points to 5 basis points on 13 January 2000.

After mopping up liquidity, the margin was restored to 15

basis points on 18 January 2000 to avoid exerting upward

pressure on call market rates. The margin was brought back

to 5 basis points on 08 February 2000. The spread between

the discount rate and rediscount rate was raised by 100

basis points, to 3.55 per cent on 08 June, to discourage

discounting through the Bank's secondary window.

The coverage of the Sri Lanka Inter Bank Offered Rate

(SLIBOR), which is based on the rates offered for rupee

transactions by 12 commercial banks, was extended in 2000.

The Central Bank commenced publishing 3-month, 6-month

and 1-year values for SLIBOR with effect from 17 July

2000, on a daily basis, in addition to the values previously

published for 1-day, 7-days and 1-month. These longer-term

values are expected to provide useful indicators of current

market perceptions on future interest rates. These rates

moved in line with call market rates. During the year,

shorter-term values varied within a wider range than longer

term values. The highest SLIBOR values were in December

2000. Overnight SLIBOR values in 2000 varied within a

range of 9.19-31.50 per cent, 7-day values in a range of

10.09-30.33 per cent, 1-month in a range of 11.10-29.00 per

cent, 3-month in a range of 14.67-26.75 per cent, 6-month

rate in a range of 14.83-25.42 per cent and 1-year rate in

a range of 14.88-24.42 per cent. These rates at end 2000

stood at 31.50 per cent, 26.00 per cent, 25.33 per cent,

24.00 per cent, 23.25 per cent, and 22.67 per cent,

respectively.

Deposit Rates

In contrast to a marginal decline in commercial bank rupee

deposit rates in 1999, rates rose in 2000, particularly in the

second half of the year. Banks faced strong competition

from government securities in the latter part of the year and

were compelled to increase their deposit rates to retain

deposits. The increase was more pronounced in fixed

deposit rates. A notable feature was that short-term rates

rose faster, resulting in an inverted yield curve for deposits.

This indicated a market perception that the prevailing high

rates on government securities were a short-term

phenomenon. Savings deposits of commercial banks, which

were in the range of 2.00-10.00 per cent in 1999, moved

to a slightly wider range of 2.00-11.00 per cent in August

2000 and thereafter remained unchanged during the rest of

the year 2000; 3-month fixed deposit rates, which stood at

7.50-11.50 per cent at end December 1999, were maintained

in this range until May 2000, before the maximum rate was

increased to 17.00 per cent in the latter part of 2000.

Similarly, the maximum rate on 6-month deposits increased

from 11.75 per cent at end 1999 to 15.00 per cent in

November 2000, while the maximum rate on 12-month

deposits moved up from 12.50 per cent to 15.00 per cent.

The Average Weighted Deposit Rate (AWDR), which is

computed monthly, based on interest rates paid on all

interest bearing deposits of commercial banks, rose from 9.1

per cent in December 1999 to 9.9 per cent in December

2000. However, the Average Weighted Fixed Deposit Rate

(AWFDR) indicated a sharper increase from 10.7 per cent

to 12.9 per cent during the year.

Following the increase in international rates, commercial banks adjusted their interest rates on foreign currency deposits upwards, particularly in the second half. Rates on savings deposits denominated in US dollars were in the range of 2.50-5.25 per cent per annum at end 1999 and moved up to a slightly wider range of 2.50-5.90 per cent per annum at end 2000. Sterling deposits, which were in a higher range than deposits denominated in US dollars, varied within a range of 3.00-7.25 per cent per annum during 2000. Following the trend in term rupee deposits, fixed deposit rates on foreign currency moved up by a higher margin than savings deposit rates. US dollar 1-year fixed deposit rates increased from a range of 5.50-6.00 per cent per annum at end 1999 to 6.00-7.00 per cent per annum at end 2000. Similarly, rates on 1-year fixed deposits denominated in sterling rose from a range of 3.50-6.75 per cent per annum to 4.40-7.75 per cent per annum during the same period. Moreover, rates offered by FCBUs on US dollar deposits stood within a range of 4.75-6.75 per cent

2 0 0

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

and for deposits in sterling pounds within a range of 5.25-

7.25 per cent per annum at end 2000.

The National Savings Bank (NSB) increased its

rates with the rising trend in yields on government

securities and increases in interest rates offered by

commercial banks to depositors. Initially, the rate on

savings deposits of NSB was reduced from 9.2 per cent to

8.4 per cent and the rate on 12-month deposits from 11.5

per cent to 10.5 per cent in February 2000. Thereafter, the

rate on 6-month fixed deposits was raised to 10.5 per cent

in June, 11.00 per cent in September and to 12.00 per cent

in October 2000. Similarly, rates on 12-month and 24-

month fixed deposits rose to 15.00 per cent and 13.8 per

cent, respectively, at end 2000, from 11.5 per cent and

12.00 per cent, respectively, at end 1999.

Lending Rates

With the rising trend in the market rates, a general upward

movement of lending rates was observed in the financial

system. Many commercial banks revised their lending rates

upward by 2-3 percentage points. With tight liquidity

conditions in the market and the rise in yield on

government securities, the Averaged Weighted Prime

Lending Rate (AWPLR), which is based on the rates

offered by commercial banks to their prime customers,

increased by about 5 percentage points during the year,

from 15.90 per cent at end 1999 to 21.46 per cent at end

2000. The increase was most sharp in the fourth quarter.

The Average Weighted Lending Rate (AWLR), which is

based on the Quarterly Survey of Bank Advances, declined

slightly from 18.9 per cent at end December 1999 to 18.5

per cent at end September 2000, owing to a substantial

increase in the outstanding amount of credit granted against

immovable property at a slightly lower rate than the rates

charged in the comparable period in 1999.

The Bank Rate, the interest rate at which the Central

Bank grants advances to licensed commercial banks for

temporary liquidity purposes, was revised three times during

the year. The Bank Rate, which was 16.00 per cent at end

1999, was raised to 18.00 per cent on 02 October 2000,

20.00 per cent on 08 November 2000 and to 25.00 per cent

with effect from 21 November 2000.

Rates on commercial paper, which are used by the

corporate sector and financial institutions to raise short-term

funds followed market trends, fluctuating within a range of

12.00-27.00 per cent in 2000, compared to the range of

11.50-18.00 per cent in the preceding year. Interest charged

by commercial banks for payments through credit cards

varied within a range of 24.00-38.40 per cent during the

year, when compared with 20.00-30.00 per cent in 1999.

The Legal Rate and the Market Rate, which are

published by the Central Bank under the Civil Procedure

Code (Amendment) Act, No.6 of 1990 and in terms of

Section 23 of the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act,

No.2 of 1990, respectively, declined slightly from 9.7 per

cent in 1999 to 9.1 per cent in 2000.

Interest rates charged by FCBUs are generally based

on the London Inter Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR). FCBU

lending rates to domestic customers were in a range of

4.50-10.00 per cent in 2000 compared to 4.00-9.00 per cent

in 1999. In the case of the foreign currency loan facilities

to non-BOI exporters, lending rates varied within a range

of 6.69-11.70 per cent, slightly higher than the 6.01-10.50

per cent range in 1999.

Long-term Rates

Long-term rates include interest rates on Rupee loans of the

government, yield rates on Treasury bonds, lending rates of

long-term credit institutions including licensed specialised

banks and debentures. The interest rates on government

securities (Rupee loans) are administratively determined.

Rupee loans with maturity periods ranging from one year

to 8-10 years were issued during 2000. These loans were

issued at par and the interest rate varied within a range of

11.00-12.00 per cent.

With high liquidity in the market and the continued

decline in inflation at the beginning of the year, coupon

rates on Treasury bonds were lowered by 25 basis points,

from the beginning of 2000. Accordingly, the coupon rates

for issues of 2-year, 3-year, 4-year, 5-year and 6-year were

10.75 per cent, 11.00 per cent, 11.25 per cent, 11.50 per

cent and 11.75 per cent, respectively. These bonds provide

risk free medium-term investment opportunities and are sold

by auction, depending on government borrowing

requirements. During the year, Treasury bonds with

maturities of 2-6 years were issued. Mixed movements were

witnessed in yields on all maturities of Treasury bonds in

the first half of 2000, but yields tended to rise in the

second half of 2000. Yields on 2-year bonds declined

gradually from 12.88 per cent in December 1999 to 12.00

per cent in May before reaching 13.11 per cent at the end

of the first half in 2000. Yields on 3-year Treasury bonds

followed the same pattern. Yields on 4-year bonds fell from

13.21 per cent to 13.05 per cent, the 5-year bonds from

13.30 to 12.94 per cent, and on 6-year bonds from 13.65

per cent to 12.53 per cent in the first half. With the rise

in interest rates, only short maturities (2-year and 3-year)

Treasury bonds were issued in the second half of 2000.

During the second half of 2000, the yield on 2-year

bonds rose from 13.63 per cent to 22.21 per cent and on

3-year bonds from 13.94 per cent to 18.71 per cent. A new

instrument, 2-year callable Treasury bonds, was issued for

the first time in November 2000. The new instrument

provides the government an option to redeem it after the

first year of issue, on a date prior to maturity. The two

auctions held on 27 and 30 November 2000 recorded yield

2 0 1

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

rates of 20.62 per cent and 22.00 per cent, respectively,

lower than the yields on plain 2-year Treasury bonds

recorded at the auctions held on the same day.

Interest rates charged by licensed specialised banks and

other long-term lending institutions also moved up,

following the rise in short-term interest rates in 2000. The

increases were seen particularly in the second half of 2000.

DFCC Bank's interest rates, which stood within a range of

10.00-19.00 per cent at end 1999, rose to a range of 12.00-

21.00 per cent at end 2000. Lending rates of NDB also rose

from 6.3 - 20.0 per cent to 14.00 - 26.50 per cent during

the period under review. Rates offered by NSB increased

from 14.0-15.0 per cent at the end 1999 to 16.0-17.5 per

cent at end 2000. The long-term lending rates of the State

Mortgage and Investment Bank (SMIB), which were in a

range of 15.00 - 18.00 per cent at end 1999, were

maintained until September and then increased to 16.00 -

18.00 per cent. The National Housing Development

Authority (NHDA) rates, remained unchanged in the ranges

of 15.0-18.0 per cent and 10.0-16.00 per cent, respectively,

as in the previous year.

These private firms, Sri Lanka Telecom Ltd., Eagle

Insurance Co., Ltd. and Suntel Ltd., issued listed debentures

during the year. All issues were over-subscribed. In March

2000, Sri Lanka Telecom issued 5-year unsecured

redeemable debentures with several interest rate options.

These debentures carried an optional coupon rate; 14.5 per

cent interest payable annually or 14.0 per cent interest

payable quarterly or a floating rate linked to the average

6-month (182 days) Treasury bill yield at the previous four

primary auctions plus 1.25 per cent payable semi-annually

(subject to a floor of 13.0 per cent and a cap of 16.0 per

cent). In March 2000, Eagle Insurance Co. Ltd. issued

3-year secured redeemable debentures as dividend payments

to its shareholders, with an interest rate of 14.5 per cent

per annum, payable bi-annually. In December 2000, Suntel

issued guaranteed redeemable debentures with tenors of five

years, six years and seven years. These debentures had a

bi-annual coupon and were issued on a fixed rate basis. The

coupon on debentures was determined using the weighted

average yield of the 3-year Treasury bond auction held

immediately preceding the issue. The 5-year debenture

carried a coupon which was 80 basis points higher than the

rate for the 3-year bonds, while the 6-year and 7-year

debentures carried coupons which were 105 and 130 basis

points, respectively, higher than this rate.

10.5 Commercial Banking

The number of licensed commercial banks operating in the

country increased from 25 at end 1999 to 26 at end 2000.

Total assets/liabilities of the domestic units of commercial

banks and those of foreign currency banking units (FCBUs)

increased during the year. Relatively higher economic

growth, improved performance in international trade and

increased demand for credit, particularly from the public

sector, due to increased fuel prices and defence related

imports were mainly responsible for this growth. Total

assets of the domestic units grew by 18.7 per cent as

compared with 13.8 per cent in the previous year. In

contrast to the decline in total assets of FCBUs by 3.5 per

cent in 1999, they increased by 27.5 per cent during the

year. A part of this was, however, a valuation adjustment

due to the depreciation of the rupee, as the assets/liabilities

of FCBUs are denominated in foreign currency.

As indicated earlier, credit from domestic banking

units, particularly to government and public corporations,

rose sharply. The credit to deposit ratio of commercial

banks increased as a result of higher growth in advances

(17.6 per cent) than in deposits (14.2 per cent).

Credit extended by FCBUs to public corporations and

the private sector increased during the year in contrast to

net repayments recorded last year. Credit to government

increased as FCBUs provided a loan of US dollars 100

million. FCBUs obtained a syndicated foreign loan to meet

this credit requirement, thus increasing their foreign

liabilities. Meanwhile, the government repaid US dollars 42

million of a previous syndicated loan of US dollars 100

million obtained from FCBUs in 1998. Foreign currency

credit granted by commercial banks to non-BOI exporters

amounted to US dollars 128 million, an increase of about

US dollars 4 million when compared to 1999. These loans

were all granted by domestic units during the year. The net

foreign asset position of domestic banking units improved

while that of FCBUs declined, resulting in a decline in

NFA of the commercial banking system.

The rise in market interest rates due to increased

government borrowing and tightened monetary policy led

banks to increase both deposit and lending rates for rupee

funds. A notable feature of the deposit interest rate structure

in the latter part of the year was that the rates on short-

term maturities were higher than on long-term maturities,

indicating an expectation of a decline in rates in the

medium-term. There were shifts from demand deposits to

interest bearing time and savings deposits as well as from

bank deposits to government securities, which had attractive

rates, particularly during the second half of the year. Even

though the inflation rate was higher in 2000, depositors

benefited from a substantially high positive real interest rate.

Following increases in international rates in 1999 and early

2000, banks also raised interest rates paid to foreign

currency deposits towards the latter part of the year.

However, in general, deposit rates recorded lower increases

compared with changes in lending rates resulting in

increased interest spreads in the banking sector.

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

Structure of Assets and Liabilities of Commercial Banks

Total resources of DBUs of commercial banks increased by

Rs. 106,826 million (18.7 per cent) in 2000 which was

significant when compared with the Rs.69,173 million (13.8

per cent) increase in 1999. On the assets side, this was

reflected mainly in an increase in credit extended and in

foreign assets. Total loans and advances, which include

loans, overdrafts facilities and purchase of commercial bills,

increased by 17 per cent and contributed 48 per cent to the

total growth of commercial bank assets. Holdings of

commercial bills, both local and export, increased

substantially in response to the improvements in

international trade and rise in public corporation borrowings

particularly deferring of CPC loans. A significant increase

in overdrafts provided to government, private sector and

public corporations was recorded. The increase in foreign

assets of commercial banks contributed 18 per cent of the

growth in total assets, in comparison to 25 per cent growth

in 1999. Cash and balances with banks and fixed and other

assets contributed about 20 per cent and 16 per cent,

respectively, of the growth in assets in 2000.

In the investment category, investment in government

securities declined substantially. This was a result of

commercial banks using government paper continuously to

obtain funds from the Central Bank under the overnight

reverse repurchase facility to ease the liquidity constraint

in the money market. However, other investments of

commercial banks increased substantially in comparison to

1999.

Within the liquid assets category, cash holdings of

commercial banks declined by 9 per cent, in comparison

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

to a 41 per cent growth in 1999, when the banks kept

additional cash at the end of 1999 as a precaution against

uncertainties relating to the Y2K problem. In contrast to the

decline in cash holdings, deposits with the Central Bank

and commercial bills increased in 2000. The ratio of total

liquid assets to total assets decreased from 28 per cent in

1999 to 25 per cent in 2000.

Within the liabilities category, deposit liabilities, which

grew by 14.4 per cent, contributed 52 per cent of the

increase in total liabilities in 2000 in comparison to 73 per

cent in 1999.

Even though growth in both demand deposits and time and savings deposits was slow, the slowdown in the growth in demand deposit balances was greater. Time and savings deposits grew by 15.3 per cent whereas demand deposits grew by 9.8 per cent. This could be attributed to depositors switching from demand deposits to government securities and fixed deposits responding to rising opportunity costs of holding non-interest bearing deposits. Reflecting a shortage of liquidity in some banks, inter-bank borrowing grew by 103 per cent when compared to a 15.6 per cent growth in

1999. Meanwhile, foreign borrowings of commercial banks grew by 36 per cent compared to 21 per cent in 1999.

Balances in the capital account grew marginally by 0.5

per cent (Rs.237 million) in 2000, compared to a 2.7 per

cent (Rs. 1,351 million) increase in 1999.

As the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) applicable to total capital (Tier 1 plus Tier II) was to be raised from 8 to 9 per cent and the CAR on Tier I capital from 4 to 4.5 per cent from January 2001, some banks made debenture issues during 1999 and 2000 to comply with the enhanced capital requirement.

Net foreign assets of DBUs of commercial banks improved substantially in 2000 compared to 1999 as foreign currency exposure was reduced due to uncertainties in the foreign exchange market and expectations of a steep depreciation of the rupee. Both foreign assets and foreign liabilities grew during the year while the faster growth in assets led to an improvement in the net assets position. Foreign assets grew by 28.2 per cent in comparison to 29.2 per cent in 1999. Within these assets, deposits with banks abroad grew by 44.5 per cent (28.8 per cent during 1999) while placements with FCBUs and other foreign assets grew by 13.6 per cent and 43.1 per cent, respectively, (38.3 per cent increase and 4.8 per cent decline, respectively, in 1999). A larger portion of other assets consisted of discounted export bills.

Over 90 per cent of the foreign liabilities of domestic banking units arise from foreign currency deposits in the non-resident foreign currency (NRFC) accounts, resident non-national foreign currency (RNNFC) accounts, resident foreign currency (RFC) accounts and foreign currency deposit accounts of exporters. Balances in these accounts

grew by 17 per cent in 2000 compared to 22 per cent in

1999. The higher growth in 1999 was mainly attributed to

the relatively large amount of compensation payments

received by Sri Lankan workers who were displaced during

the Gulf War.

The number of FCBUs operating in 2000 increased to

26 from 25 in 1999 as a new commercial bank entered the

banking business. Total assets/liabilities of FCBUs increased

by US dollars 206 million (15 per cent) in contrast to the

decrease of US dollars 143 million (9 per cent) in 1999.

More than 50 per cent of the resources of FCBUs came

through DBU placements of foreign currency deposits and

deposits by BOI enterprises. Resources from non-national

sources accounted for around 27 per cent of total resources.

In comparison to 1999, resources from both resident and

non-resident categories increased during 2000. Investments

with non-resident enterprises and loans and advances to BOI

enterprises were the main areas where FCBU funds were

utilised. Credit extended to BOI enterprises increased from

US dollars 680 million in 1999 to US dollars 690 million

in 2000, reflecting the growth in exports and increase in

domestic interest rates during the year. FCBUs lent a net

amount of US dollars 58 million to the government in

2000. In contrast to the net improvement in foreign assets

of DBUs, net foreign assets of FCBUs decreased during the

year.

The FCBUs extended a significant amount of credit to

public corporations and to the private sector. Credit to

public corporations increased by US dollars 134 million

mainly due to credit to the CPC. Meanwhile, credit to the

private sector, which includes BOI enterprises, increased by

US dollars 10 million to reach US dollars 709 million. On

the liabilities side, the increase was a combined outcome

of an increase in non resident liabilities (US dollars 123

million), particularly due to the US dollars 100 million loan,

increase in resident liabilities (US dollars 36 million) and

increase in internal accounts (US dollars 47 million). About

62 per cent of resident liabilities was through placements

of funds by domestic units.

Credit extend under the special facility to non-BOI exporters increased only slightly during the year. A sum of US dollars 128 million was granted in 2000, as against a sum of US dollars 124 million in 1999. In comparison to US dollars 25 million which was granted by FCBUs under this facility in 1999, all credit granted in 2000 came from DBUs.

Sources and Uses of Funds of Domestic Units of Commercial Banks

In line with the higher rate of growth in assets and

liabilities in 2000, resources available to commercial banks

increased significantly. The total net availability of

resources to commercial banks grew by 71 per cent to

Rs.26,697 million in 2000. In comparison, it increased by

3 per cent in 1999. On a net basis, other banks, the private

sector and the Central Bank were major sources of funds

(approximately 99.7 per cent of the total), while government

corporations, the foreign sector, the government and other

assets and other liabilities were the major users of funds.

The biggest single source of funds for commercial

banks in 2000 on a net basis was the borrowings from

domestic banks which contributed about 55 per cent 'of

required funds on a net basis, reflecting the tight liquidity

condition in some banks. In comparison, only 9 per cent

of resources were provided from this source in 1999.

Reverse repurchase agreements with the Central Bank,

which do not explicitly appear in this classification of

sources and uses, were a large source of funds to

commercial banks, providing around Rs.30,426 million in

2000 in comparison to Rs.513 million in 1999. The private

sector, the second largest net source of funds, contributed

about 40 per cent to the total.

In contrast to the previous year, the Central Bank

became a net provider of funds by providing about 5 per

cent of the increase in resources of commercial banks in

2000. This was mainly due to the elimination of the

statutory reserve requirement on foreign currency deposits.

Public corporations and the government absorbed about

54 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively, of the funds.

Meanwhile, showing a further increase from the previous

year, the foreign sector became a net user of funds as the

domestic units of commercial banks built up their net

foreign asset position.

In contrast to the trend observed in previous years, the

other assets and liabilities category was a net user of funds.

In this category the increase in capital and reserves was

lower than in 1999 while the increase in other assets

exceeded the increase in other liabilities.

Commercial Banks' Loans and Advances1

Based on the Quarterly Survey of commercial banks' loans

and advances, the outstanding amount of total loans and

advances granted to the non-government sector (public

corporations and private sector) by commercial banks

registered a point to point growth of 15.9 per cent at end

September 2000, as against a 12.4 per cent growth in the

12-months ending September 1999.

Among the sectors, services, industry and housing and

property development and commerce recorded high rates of

growth. The total outstanding amount of credit in the

services sector grew by 32 per cent, absorbing 6 per cent

of the total credit outstanding. The housing and property

development and industrial sectors grew by 20 per cent

each and absorbed 13 per cent and 11 per cent,

respectively, of total credit outstanding at end September

2000. The growth in credit to the services sector and

industrial sector was in line with the improved performances

of these sectors in GDP, where the services sector grew by

6.9 per cent and the industry sector by 10.2 per cent in the

third quarter of 2000.

The commercial sector, which accounted for the largest

portion (42 per cent) of credit outstanding, recorded a

moderate growth in credit (18 per cent from end September

1999 to end September 2000). Credit extended to the

commercial sector increased in line with the growth in some

categories of exports, i.e., garments and fabrics, processed

tea and minor export crops and some categories of imports,

i.e., pharmaceuticals and petroleum products. Among the

other sub categories in the commercial sector, wholesale

and retail trade, which absorbed 11 per cent of total

outstanding credit, recorded a 10 per cent growth in credit

at end September 2000.

The consumption category, which absorbed 11 per cent

of total credit outstanding, recorded a 9 per cent growth in

credit. In this category, a large portion (79 per cent) of

credit was absorbed by individuals for their personal needs.

206

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

Meanwhile, credit provided through credit cards, though

absorbing only 0.5 per cent of total credit, grew by 41 per

cent reflecting growth in the use of credit cards.

Of the total credit extended by commercial banks,

financial, agricultural and other sectors absorbed 4 per cent,

5 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively, at end September

2000. Fifty per cent of credit outstanding in the financial

sector was absorbed by financial institutions and leasing

companies, while out of the total credit outstanding in the

agricultural sector, one third was absorbed by the tea sector.

The tourism sector, which absorbed only 1 per cent of

credit, recorded a further drop in credit at end September

2000 in line with slowing down in the tourist industry

during the first nine months of 2000.

In terms of the maturity pattern, a large portion of

credit to the non-government sector by commercial banks

continued to be in the form of short-term credit. At end

September 2000, short-term credit (less than one year)

accounted for 63 per cent of total credit, while the share

of medium-term (2-5 years) and long-term (over 5 years)

credit were 22 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively. This

pattern held for all sectors, except housing and property

development and tourism. In the case of credit to the

housing and property development sector, 48 per cent was

in the form of long-term credit while medium-term and

short-term credit were 33 per cent and 19 per cent,

respectively.

The share of credit given against various types of

security remained relatively stable in 2000. Slight changes

were seen in credit against government securities,

immovable property, plant and machinery and personal

guarantees and promissory notes. Credit extended against

government securities increased from 1 per cent at end

September 1999 to 3 per cent at end September 2000. This

can be attributed to incentives to hold government paper,

following higher yield rates. Credit against immovable

property, and plant and machinery increased from 26 per

cent to 28 per cent during the same period, while the

relative importance of credit against personal guarantees and

promissory notes dropped by 2 percentage points to reach

14 per cent at end September 2000. Fixed, savings and

other deposits (10 per cent) was the other important form

of security. Unsecured credit accounted for 14 per cent of

total credit.

The proportion of credit provided at higher rates of

interests by commercial banks continued to decline. The

percentage share of total credit given at interest rates over

25 per cent declined by about 2 percentage points from the

level at end September 1999, while the percentage share of

credit given at interest rates ranging between 21 and 25 per

cent dropped by 3 percentage points. The proportion of total

outstanding credit granted at interest rates ranging between

16 and 20 per cent rose from 34 per cent at end September

1999 to 38 per cent at end September 2000.

Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) Systems

Rapid technological developments in the financial sector

and increased competition among market players have

called upon the payment and settlement systems to play

a very dynamic and challenging role. As described in a

-BIS publication4", a payment system consists of> 'a set

of instruments, banking procedures and typically, inter­

bank funds transfer system that ensure the circulation of

money. The funds transfer system or the settlement

system is the core of any payment system, which

typically involves an agreement among a defined group

*of participants in the system and the system1! operator,

specifying rules and procedures related to the transfer of

funds among the participan|s, s .

There are two major types of payment, settlement

"systems: ;

• • * Designated Time (or Deferred) Net^Settlemeht

.System (DNS) ,s jt %' c*

• Real Time Gross Settlement Systems (RTGS)

The main distinction between RTGS and DNS

concerns the form and timing of settlement. DNS

systems can handle payment messages in real time but

they settle in batches on a net basis at designated times

which could be during the operating day or, more

typically, at the end of the day. On the other hand,

RTGS systems settle payments on a transaction-by-

transaction basis as soon as they are accepted by the

system

As the funds transfer is carried out at a designated time in the DNS systems, it causes the system's participants to be exposed to financial risks for the period during which the settlement is deferred. If not sufficiently controlled, these risks can affect not only the direct counter-parties but also other participants, because one participant's inability to settle could cause the positions of other participants to change, opening up the possibility that they too might fail to meet their obligations. RTGS systems, howSver, do not create credit risk for the receiving participant because they Settle each payment individually, as soon as it is accepted by the system for settlement.

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka is currently examining the prospects of setting up an RTGS System; RTGS systems may require relativel| large amounts of intra-day liquidity, because participants need'sufficient

liquidity to cover their outgoing gross payments. Liquidity can come from various sources including opening balances or reserve balances at the central bank, incoming payments and intra-day credit. Adequate - liquidity, relative to the value and distribution of payments, makes a smooth flow of payments possible through such systems, helping to avoid delays in individual payments and minimising liquidity risks. There are many variants in the design and operation of RTGS systems, notably in respect of operating

* arrangements and the use of intra-day credit to provide > liquidity. i

RTGS systems are operative in many developed countries, specifically in most of the G-10 countries. The Fedwire in the United States (1970), FA in the Netherlands (1985), RIX in Sweden (1986), SIC (Swiss Inter-Bank Clearing) in Switzerland (1987), ELS (Euro

* Link System) in Germany (1987), BOJ-NET (Bank of Japan Financial Network System) in Japan (1988), BISS in Italy (1989), CHAPS (Clearing House Automated

'•' Payment System) in the United Kingdom (1996) and ELLIPS (Electronic Large Value system, Inter-Bank

^ Payment system) in Belgium (1996) are some of the RTGS systems that are currently in operation. The ECB . TARGET (Trans -European Real Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer) in Europe is a multi-country payment system, which links the RTGS systems of the central bank members in the European Union. RTGS systems are also in operation in Hong Kong since 1996 and in Australia since 1998. Many other central banks outside the G-10 countries have started to introduce RTGS systems for making wholesale payments or are seeking to enhance their current systems to provide for RTGS to achieve safe and sound payment systems.

However, poorly designed payment systems may lead to systemic crises if risks are not adequately contained as financial shocks can be passed from one participant to another. The effects of such disruption could extend beyond the system and its participants, threatening the stability of money markets and of other domestic and international financial markets. In order to , ensure safety in a payment system, it is necessary first to identify and understand how risks of various types 'may arise or be transmitted within the system and to determine where they are borne. Once these risks are properly analysed and assessed, appropriate and effective

* mechanisms must be devised to monitor, manage and control them.

including:

10.6 Central Banking

Central Bank operations during 2000 focused on maintaining stability in the foreign exchange and money markets while ensuring the availability of adequate rupee liquidity to facilitate economic activity. The Bank Rate, repo rate and reverse repo rate were raised, particularly in the second half of the year as a contractionary monetary policy stance was adopted. However, demand for funds under the reverse repo facility remained high reflecting the tight liquidity situation in the money market. Consequently, the Central Bank provided substantial amounts of rupee liquidity to the market through its reverse repo window. The margin between the Central Bank's buying and selling rates for the US dollar was widened from 2 per cent to 8 per cent during the year to provide greater flexibility to the market and reduce pressure on external reserves.

Structure of Assets and Liabilities

The total assets and liabilities of the Central Bank increased by 8.3 per cent (Rs.16,605 million) to Rs.217,191 million in 2000 compared to a 6.3 per cent (Rs.11,913 million) growth in 1999.

Box 11 (Contd.)

credit problems and, as a result, could threaten

the stability of the system or of financial

markets.

Central banks play a leading role in the

development of payment settlement systems, particularly

because of their strong interest in financial stability.

Their role in providing settlement accounts for payment

system participants, their concerns with the functioning

of money markets for the implementation of monetary

policy and with maintaining confidence in the domestic

currency both in normal circumstances and in a crisis.

are also contributory factors for their significant

involvement in the development of these systems.

The CBSL is currently in the process of obtaining

consultancy support to prepare the groundwork towards

setting up an RTGS system. The development of this

RTGS System is a component of a broader project to

develop a payment settlement system in the country.

Preliminary work on this project, i.e., setting up an

in-house Scripless Securities Trading System (SSTS) and

an Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) system, has already

commenced. The SSTS, inclusive of the Central

Depository System (CDS), has been developed by the

Information Technology Department and the Public Debt

Department for the use of primary auctions of

government securities.

On the assets side, the increase was entirely due to the increase in domestic assets of the Central Bank which more than offset the decline in foreign assets. Total international reserves of the Central Bank declined by 28.7 per cent (Rs.31,030 million) reflecting the increased deficit in the BOP in 2000. In comparison, foreign assets declined by 14.9 per cent (Rs.18,954 million) in 1999. Repayment of foreign public debt and sales of foreign exchange to commercial banks were the main factors leading to the outflow.

In contrast to the decline in foreign assets, domestic

assets of the Central Bank increased significantly by

Rs.47,635 million (52 per cent) compared to the Rs.30,886

million (50.2 per cent) in 1999. Loans and advances to the

government through the revolving credit facility increased

by Rs.4,200 million (11.8 per cent), while holdings of

Treasury bills and Treasury bonds increased by Rs.41,329

million (161 per cent). The increase in the holdings of

government paper by the Central Bank was a result of the

injection of liquidity to the market through its primary and

secondary market operations to offset the shortage of rupee

liquidity in the market. The total outstanding amount of

209

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

Treasury bill and Treasury bond holdings of the Central

Bank increased by Rs.41,329 million in 2000 to a value of

Rs.66,952 million (Treasury bills Rs.37,898 million,

Treasury bonds, Rs.29,054 million) at the end of the year.

Out of these total holdings, Rs.30,426 million was on

account of reverse repurchase transactions (Treasury bills

Rs. 1,372 million, Treasury bonds Rs.29,054 million). In

comparison, the value of reverse repurchase transactions at

end 1999 amounted to Rs.630 million.

On the liabilities side, the total currency issue of the

Bank increased by 4.4 per cent (Rs.3,106 million) during

the year. Issue of currency notes increased by 4.1 per cent

while the issue of coins increased by 12.5 per cent. The

currency issue during the year reflected the usual growth,

in contrast to 1999 which had a substantial increase of 16.8

per cent as holdings of cash increased for precautionary

purposes due to Y2K related problems at the end of 1999.

Deposit liabilities of the Central Bank declined by Rs.261

million (0.4 per cent). This was entirely due to a decline

in deposits of international organisations by Rs.2,577

million (6.9 per cent) in comparison to Rs. 1,229 million (3

per cent) increase during 1999. Meanwhile, deposits with

the government increased by Rs.689 million (28 per cent)

and deposits of commercial banks increased by Rs. 1,585

million (5.2 per cent).

10.7 Banking Development

The total number of commercial banks operating in the

country at end 2000 was 26, consisting of 2 state banks, 8

domestic private banks and 16 foreign banks. The domestic

private banks included the National Mercantile Bank Ltd.,

which commenced operations as a new private bank during

the year. ANZ Grindlays Bank Ltd., a branch of a foreign

bank was renamed as Standard Chartered Grindlays Bank

Ltd. consequent on the acquisition abroad of ANZ

Grindlays Bank by Standard Chartered Bank Ltd. A licence

was issued to Ceylinco Savings Bank Ltd. (though it did

not commence business in 2000) to operate as a Licensed

Specialised Bank (LSB), thereby increasing the total number

of LSBs to 13. This includes 6 Regional Development

Banks (RDBs), National Savings- Bank, the State Mortgage

and Investment Bank, 2 long-term lending institutions, and

three private savings and development banks. An important

development in banking policy in 2000 was the further

liberalisation of foreign ownership of licensed banks. The

Budget 2000 announced a proposal permitting the increase

of foreign ownership of licensed banks from 49 per cent

to 60 per cent of the issued share capital.

Branch Network

The network of bank branches expanded further in 2000.

Kachcheri branches, extension offices and overseas branches

(excluding 186 pawning centres), increased to 1,090 in 2000

from 1,055 at end 1999. The increase in the branch network

came mainly through the opening of 32 branches by

domestic private banks. Commercial Bank of Ceylon Ltd.

and Pan Asia Bank Ltd. opened five branches each, while

Hatton National Bank (HNB) Ltd. and Sampath Bank Ltd.

established four branches each during the year. Nations

Trust Bank Ltd. and Seylan Bank Ltd. set up three branches

and one branch, respectively. The total number of extension

offices/pay offices increased by nine, while the number of

ASC branches and Kachcheri branches of Bank of Ceylon

remained unchanged. The branch network of the two state

banks also remained unchanged. These developments,

together with the establishment of National Mercantile Bank

Ltd., resulted in expanding the total branch network of

domestic banks by 32 to reach 1,045 at end 2000. In

addition, HNB formed thirty four student units in schools.

Box 12 Money Laundering - Its Economic Consequences

What is money laundering?

Money laundering, in simple terms, is the process by

which 'illegal' or 'dirty' money is converted into

respectable assets. One technical definition of this is 'the

process of converting cash, or other property which is

derived from criminal activity, so as to give it the

appearance of having been obtained from a legitimate

source'1

The problem of money laundering is not new.

However, several factors have tended to exacerbate the

problem in the last few decades. Chief among these

factors are economic globalisation that has strengthened

economic interacsions among nations; the relaxation of

controls on capital flows, particularly the removal of

exchange controls that has encouraged the flow of funds

from one country to another; the emergence of new

countries seeking international funds for economic

development; the large scale sale of state owned

enterprises by many countries, these sales often taking

place in international markets; technological

developments facilitating transfer of funds; and the

development of new financial instruments that have

facilitated the anonymous transfer of funds.

Magnitude of the problem

In addition, the magnitude of the flows makes it a matter of serious concern. Although the very nature of these transactions makes measurement difficult, it has been estimated that the annual turnover of the illegal drug industry alone was around US dollars 400 billion, or 8 per cent of all global trade, in 1997. As money laundering involves not only drug trafficking, but also arms dealing, gambling and other such activity, the actual sums involved would be much greater. This sheer magnitude of the problem is one of the reasons that has compelled international groups such as the Financial Actions Task Force set up by the Group of 10 and the UN International Drug Control Programme to address themselves to combating the problem of money laundering. < ~

Economic concerns

Money laundering concerns not only law agencies and

tax authorities, but also those responsible for economic

1 McDonnell R. (1997) An Overview of the Global Money Laundering Problem, International Anti-Money Laundering Standards and the Work of the Financial Actions Task Force, in Global Drug Laws, New Delhi.

development policy. The focus of this box article is on

these economic consequences, which are described

•below. -i t-

a. Breakdown of market mechanisms

Money laundering presents a classic case where

private benefits and social benefits do not match,

thereby resulting in a breakdown of the mechanism

underlying the normal free market system.

Individuals or organisations, which engage in

money laundering, gain substantial benefits by

doing so, whereas the process is detrimental to the

well being of society as a whole. This breakdown

in the market mechanism requires direct

intervention by the government.

b. Flows of funds are not based on returns to

investment

The general free market principle is that resources would be used in a manner that they would yield optimal returns. However, those who wish to launder money are more concerned with 'cleaning' their funds than in obtaining the best returns. Thus, they would even invest in enterprises with sub optimal returns so long as their funds could be laundered. On a macro scale, this would be reflected in large flows of money to countries which had lax regulations with regard to money laundering, even if such countries had unsatisfactory macroeconomic conditions, such as an over valued exchange rate, high fiscal and trade deficits and high inflation. Thus, the normal market forces, which would encourage the development of efficient organisations and the maintenance of viable macroeconomic conditions in countries, would no longer operate. The signals emanating from the market would appear to reward weak economic policies. Hence, the primary advantage of a free market, viz., the efficient use of resources, would be lost.

c. Demand for money would not reflect economic

activity

Many policy decisions in a modern economy are

based on functional relationships between

economic activity and the demand for money.

However, money laundering, and the associated

existence of black money, can cause significant

distortions in the demand for money, resulting in

difficulties in monetary management.

2 1 1

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

d. Distortion of taxes

Money laundering is inextricably linked with

illegal activity and thus tax evasion. If money

laundering takes place in significant volumes, the

tax base of the country can be affected,

significantly eroding tax revenues.

e. Asset price bubbles

^It has been noted that money laundering often

results in inflows of funds to certain economic

assets, e.g., real estate, stocks, bonds. These

inflows, which are often large and occur within

short periods, tend to drive up the prices of these

assets far beyond the levels justified by economic

fundamentals. As a result, 'asset price bubbles'

develop. Outflows of funds can also be rapid,

causing these bubbles to burst, with disastrous

consequences for other sectors in the economy. For

instance, a sudden drop in real estate prices can # cause immense harm*fo the entire banking sector*

if a large amount of credit had been granted with

real estate as collateral.

f. Economic instability and loss of confidence

As the aim of money laundering is to clean money

rather than to invest, laundered funds tend to move

swiftly from one investment to another and from

one location to another. This volatile movement of

large sums of money leads to destabilisation of

sectors affected and can effect entire economies.

The total number of foreign bank branches including extension/sub offices increased from 42 to 45 at end 2000, resulting in the total number of commercial bank branches increasing to 1,090 at end 2000. With the expansion in the branch network, the number of persons served by a commercial bank branch (excluding pawning centres) declined from 18,050 at end 1999 to 17,761 at end 2000.

The total number of branches of twelve LSBs increased by four and stood at 315, consisting mainly of 181 branches of RDBs and 100 branches of the National Savings Bank.

Banking Facilities

Facilities provided by commercial banks expanded in an intensely competitive environment to cater to the growing needs of customers. Banking products such as automated teller machines (ATMs), credit cards, electronic funds transfer facilities, internet banking, phone banking, on line services and extended banking hours are among the services provided by commercial banks, apart from traditional

; Box 12 (Contd.)

Thus, these movements of funds have an adverse

impact on economic development.

Moreover, money laundering activity has the effect

of destroying confidence in the underlying system.

A modern economy, in particular the financial

sector, is based on confidence. If, however, certain

crucial segments of the economy are found to be

seriously affected by illegal activity, then, people

lose faith in the system and economic activity and

development suffers.

Dealing with the problem

Clearly, money laundering has become a major problem

in international economics. Although a few countries

may benefit by permitting their territories to be used for

money laundering, the world economy as a whole

suffers. It is also evident that a few countries alone

cannot address the problem. Only the entire

international community acting in concert can deal with

the problem effectively. It is this awareness that has

led to the current situation where a number of

international organisations are focussing their attention

on dealing with the problem. Sri Lanka too, is a part

of this international effort to combat money laundering.

The banking sector in Sri Lanka has been made aware

of the problem and precautions are being taken. The

facility of maintaining secret numbered accounts

introduced in thevpast has been eliminated. Formal

legislation to address the problem, by way of a Money

Laundering Act, is being prepared.

banking services. Commercial banks have introduced several new deposit and loan products, and some other services during the year, while applying technological advances in banking facilities.

Commercial banks installed 57 ATMs during the period, thus raising the total number of commercial bank ATMs operating in the country to 373. The use of credit cards continued to grow. The total number of cards (net of cancellations) issued increased from approximately 143,000 at end 1999 to approximately 205,000 at end 2000. Of the total cards issued, 52,000 were local cards, while 153,000 were global cards. Global cards can be used for both international transactions and local transactions. The outstanding credit balance increased by 58 per cent to Rs.3,738 million.

In addition to commercial banks, LSBs also expanded facilities during the year with the introduction of new deposit and loan schemes.

The Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka, established under the Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka Act,

No. 18 of 1990 as amended by Act, No.8 of 1995, completed its tenth year of operations in May 2000. The primary objectives of the Bureau are to collect and collate information on borrowers and furnish credit information to lending institutions that are shareholders of the Bureau. The major shareholders of the Bureau are the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, commercial banks, and six licensed specialised banks. In addition, registered finance companies, regional development banks and some leasing companies and merchant banks are also shareholders.

It is envisaged that at least 12 more institutions will become members of the Bureau in 2001, when leasing companies are registered as leasing establishments under the Finance Leasing Act.

Presently, major concerns of the Bureau are the coverage and the quality of information. Accordingly, during the year, the Bureau was able to increase its database to 172,099 borrowers, whose borrowings consist of 66,476 regular advances and 37,869 irregular advances.

The number of credit reports issued by the Bureau during the year increased by 9 per cent to 169,088 from the 155,243 reports issued in 1999. As a result, total revenue from credit reports increased to Rs.9.4 million compared to Rs.7.9 million in 1999. The net profit of the Bureau increased to Rs.6.5 million, a 20 per cent increase over the net profit of Rs.5.4 million in 1999. Accordingly, the Board of Directors of the Bureau, for the first time, declared a dividend of 10 per cent to the shareholders from the profit of 1999. Further, the Board declared a 12 per cent dividend from the profits for 2000.

10.9 Rural Banking and Credit

Overall Trends and Developments

The system of forward sales contracts for agricultural

commodities, introduced by the Central Bank in 1999 on

a trial basis to ensure stable prices for farmers, was

vigorously promoted by the Bank in 2000. The policy

strategy mainly concentrated on promoting this concept

among rural producers, with banking institutions acting as

facilitators for making such contracts between the farmers

and the buyers. The scheme was promoted in rural areas

with the assistance of lending banks, the Ministry of

Agriculture, the Department of Agriculture, the Agricultural

and Agrarian Insurance Board, the co-operative sector,

private sector establishments and NGOs. The forward sales

mechanism is intended to moderate sharp price fluctuations

between cropping seasons and off-seasons by facilitating

farmers to enter into agreements with selected buyers for

sale of their produce in advance at a pre-determined price.

, The scheme is gaining popularity among farmers and many

institutions including banks in the rural sector.

Several policy measures were taken during the year to support the marketing of agricultural produce at reasonable prices. Among them was the expansion of the scope of the New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme to include pre-harvest and post-harvest handling and processing activities. In the past, the Scheme provided financing facilities only for the cultivation of paddy and subsidiary food crops. Under this new arrangement, farmers, farmer organisations, traders and people based companies who entered into forward sales agreements became eligible to obtain loans under the extended scheme on the same terms and conditions as cultivators. The NCRCS continued to provide loans for paddy and subsidiary food crops utilising funds of the participating credit institutions, backed by an interest subsidy from the government. The interest rate applicable to on-lending under the scheme remained at 12 per cent per annum in spite of the increasing interest rates in other sectors of the economy. The Agricultural and Agrarian Insurance Board offered an insurance package to farmers who enter into forward sales contracts to cover the total loan amount obtained and the total income expected from cultivation of covered crops such as paddy, other food crops, fruits, flowers and coconut.

The Credit Guarantee Scheme, which has been in operation with government funds since 1998, continued to provide credit guarantee cover for NCRCS loans. For loans granted for post-harvest handling and processing activities, the credit guarantee coverage was enhanced to Rs.2.7 million, while the maximum indemnity payment was increased to Rs.1.6 million.

The Poverty Alleviation Microfinance Projects continued to be in operation during the year. The activities of the Small Farmers and the Landless Credit Project (SFLCP), continued in four districts and created opportunities for the rural poor to organise themselves into people based societies by building social capital as a safety net for development. The project, which is in operation in the Kandy, Puttalam, Galle and Matara districts, will be

replicated in six other districts, viz., Kurunegala, Matale,

Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, Kalutara and Hambantota, with

funds made available by the Japanese Bank for International

Co-operation (JBIC). The expansion of the SFLCP is an

endorsement of the concept of poverty alleviation by

improving the status of women through promoting their full

participation in contributing to the overall development of

society. This approach to credit disbursement has been very

successful, particularly in areas where the incidence of

poverty was significantly high, as it contributed to reducing

the high cost of borrowing by members of those societies

and to increasing their living standards.

The regional branch expansion programme of private

banks has continued, thereby making their services more

accessible to people living in remote areas. For the first

time, a credit card system was introduced to the agricultural

sector with the Seylan Bank introducing a credit card called

'Govi Sarupatha'. This system is intended to reduce the

transaction costs involved in obtaining credit facilities by

farmers from the formal banking system and to build up

farmers' self esteem. This special credit card facility was

given to those farmers who were eligible to obtain loans

under the NCRCS. The programme was launched in the

Bakamuna area in the Polonnaruwa District during the year

under review and is expected to be extended to other

regions in the future.

The participation of RDBs in rural lending activities

expanded during the year. The RDBs, which were

established by amalgamating the district-based Regional

Rural Development Banks, showed progress after the

restructuring process by becoming eligible to participate in

several foreign funded credit schemes. The Kandurata

Development Bank (KDB), having satisfied the eligibility

criteria for participation under the ADB projects, was

admitted as a participating financial institution (PFI) under

the Perennial Crops Development Project (PCDP) and the

Tea Development Project (TDP).

Forward Sales Contract System (Govi Sahanaya Scheme)

As a first step in launching the forward sales contract (FSC) scheme, action was taken to popularise the scheme among farming communities, traders, farmer organisations and bankers through meetings and the media. As a second step, programmes were conducted for government and non­governmental organisations, private sector firms and farmer organisations to make them aware of the method of determining forward prices for agricultural commodities such as paddy, maize, sesame, onion, green gram and black gram. The total number of programmes conducted during the year under review was 443, with a participation of about 17,000. Among the participants, 15,379 were farmers, while the rest were bankers and agents from government and non-governmental agencies.

Progress made in 2000 in respect of entering into FSCs

with the assistance of the facilitating banks and the other

institutions is given below.

By the end of the year, some farmer groups who

cultivated a number of other crops, e.g., soya bean, red

onion, and big onion, showed interest in joining the FSC

system. Buyers in both private and state sectors have

responded favourably to entering into forward contracts with

farmers, farmer organisations, collectors etc. as the quality

of produce was guaranteed by the Department of

Agriculture. In the implementation process, it has been

observed that the FSC mechanism encouraged farmers to

increase yields and improve quality, which ensures a

satisfactory income, while large scale buyers were also

encouraged to purchase directly from the local farmers or

collectors subject to the maintenance of the required quality

in each crop.

The Dambulla wholesale market, which was developed

by the government in 1999, continued to operate as the

largest fruit and vegetable market in Sri Lanka. This

market, named the Dambulla Dedicated Economic Centre

(DDEC), provides infrastructure facilities for wholesale

marketing of fruits and vegetables. This Centre has become

a distribution centre for both locally grown and imported

fruits and vegetables. The Centre is managed jointly by the

government and the traders involved, and has emerged as

an easily accessible centre to market agricultural produce

at reasonable prices. The DDEC is being developed by the

government on a pilot basis and it is expected to set up

similar markets in other parts of the country and for other

agricultural commodities. These facilities would assist

agricultural producers to market their output and obtain

stable prices while enabling consumers to obtain quality

produce at a lower cost.

Box 13 Building "Social Capital': Sri Lanka's Experience through the Small Farmers and the Landless Credit Project

'Social capital' or the force that emerges through the synergic power of a group of people has recently been identified as an integral element of sustainable social and economic development. Social capital refers to the interactions, norms and behavioural ethics among individuals who establish self-help groups, networks and organisations to achieve goals, which are of mutual benefit to them. Social capital is not just the sum of the institutions that underpin a society, but the glue that holds them together. It emerges through association of people, i.e., family members, relatives, neighbours, friends, peer groups and members of social and professional associations. This social binding has an effect on community productivity and its well being. Hence, social capital does not exist when individuals are taken separately, but exists when individuals strive hard as a team with oust and mutual understanding towards achieving a common goal. Social capital, therefore, shapes the quality and quantity of social interactions, thereby enabling people, especially poor people, to survive day to day hardships when they are unable to do so individually. In essence, social capital, which refers to the norms and networks that enable people to act collectively, has of late risen to prominence as an effective tool of social and economic development (see Das Gupta, P. and Seragildin, I., 1999). However, not all economists agree on the usefulness of the concept.

The importance of social capital can be viewed from different angles. From the viewpoint of a community, social capital tightens social units, thereby reducing costs of family businesses and increasing family incomes to a certain extent. It adds more value to education, health, sanitation, sports, entertainment, social virtues and cultural practices. Social capital and poverty alleviation programmes also have a close relationship with each other. The higher the incidence of poverty, the higher the necessity for building social capital. In such situations, social capital acts as a safety net and the voice of the poor communities. Social capital, in turn, creates synergic power among groups of people who attempt to achieve common goals by forming firms, associations, networks, societies (death benefit societies, co-operative societies, thrift and credit societies, farmers' societies, women's societies etc.). It is therefore a factor contributing to economic development, whilst reducing the imbalance between the rich and the poor. However, the of impact of social capital depends upon the economic, social and political environment of a country.

The importance of social capital has not been recognised or measured, and perhaps has been underestimated in many theories of 'economic development'. Mainstream economics usually emphasises the possibility of increasing productivity of human capital through division of labour and specialisation, but does not recognise the positive aspects of social interactions. Instead, social capital is often viewed as exploitative, burdensome, anti-systemic and therefore irrelevant, looking only at the negative aspects of social interactions. However, it has been proven through experience of programmes implemented in developing countries that social capital is more crucial and closely connected to poverty reduction programmes. It has further been observed that such programmes are far more successful with social capital at grassroots level than programmes without social capital and with a top-down approach.

Social capital, though it is not very familiar in everyday language, is not a new ideology for Sri Lanka, as it is inherent in the culture of Sri Lankans with extended family systems and community based economic activities. Even today, social capital is extensively used in agricultural activities and other social events at village level. This feature is known as 'reciprocity'or mutual-aid in farming and other social activities. As reciprocity supplements human capital and physical capital, many development programmes have included it as an integral element in achieving their targets.

Following these considerations, in the late 1970s, emphasis was given by many international donor organisations to poverty alleviation throughout the developing nations and Sri Lanka was not an exception. During that period, successive governments and non­governmental organisations {NGOs) in Sri Lanka were given funds for launching poverty alleviation programmes. A leading NGO, the Sarvodaya Movement, under its Village Adoption Programme extensively used social capital to combat poverty in areas where poverty was an acute problem. Subsequently, various NGOs conducted similar programmes with local and international funds for the supply of credit and other services. As the sustainability of donor funded programmes depends on the availability of financial resources, the necessity arose for developing a suitable sustainable poverty alleviation programme with special emphasis on providing credit facilities to the poor through the formal banking system. Building up social

2 1 7

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

capital was hence considered essential for the

sustainability and success of such programmes. The

Central Bank experimented with this concept in one of

its development credit programmes, viz. the Small

Farmers and the Landless Credit Project, called the

Isuru' Project in Sinhala.

Mechanism used in the ISURU Project in building Social Capital

The mechanism adopted in building social capital in the

Isuru Project involved going through five steps. The first

step was to identify villages based on a survey

conducted by a change agent and announce the

programme objectives and concepts at meetings with

people of the village, called 'Janahamuwa'. The second

step was to encourage target beneficiaries to form

themselves into small Self Help Groups (SHGs), of

people in identical poverty situations and other similar

interests. The group members were taken through a

series of social mobilisation programmes where they

were given the opportunity to identify the strengths,

weaknesses and opportunities they have and threats they

face. The social mobilisation programmes covered areas

such as the creation of awareness of the reasons for

poverty, the way to get out of the poverty trap using

existing opportunities and strengths, the power of social

capital or synergic force of a group of people in

realising objectives and facing common problems, the

value of thrift and savings habits and credit discipline,

participation in group voluntary activities and the

strength of women's participation in income generating

activities.

As the third step, savings habits and thrift were

inculcated among the SHG members. The Project

promoted savings through compulsory group savings and

voluntary group savings, such as rotational savings called

'Seettu' and collective purchase of raw materials,

consumer goods, fertiliser and pesticides at wholesale

prices. The total group savings of the SHG members as

at end 2000, stood at Rs78.4 million. The exchange of

labour {'aththam') fostered among the beneficiaries,

helped then to build social capital and reduce the cost

of their day to day business. When the SHGs were

firmly formed, members were given training in different

areas such as development of basic entrepreneurial skills,

accounting, leadership and marketing. At end 2000,

10,280 SHGs had been established with 61,752 members

in four districts, of whom 42,867 were women. The

group members, in the meantime, could obtain loans

from group savings as well as from participating banks

through the Project. The total amount of loans granted

Box 13 (Contd.)

to members stood at Rs.594 million at end 2000. The

cumulative recovery ratio was 97 per cent. The problem

of lack of collateral for obtaining loans from the formal

banking system had been overcome through an inter-se

guarantee provided by other group members.

As the fourth step, SHGs were converted into

formal community based organisations as limited liability

Isuru Development Societies (IDSs) by registering them

with the Registrar of Companies. This enabled them to

function as 'Beneficiary NGOs* with a wide array of

tasks and functions assigned to them. These include

functioning as link agencies relating to credit, mobilising

savings from members, investing excess funds, issuing

shares, extending micro loans and representing Isuru

beneficiaries at various fora. These societies were formed

after funding agencies terminated their fund flow in

December 1997. At end 2000, 187 such IDSs had been

set up. The value of shares issued to shareholders

amounted to Rs.5.8 million whereas normal savings and

compulsory savings amounted to Rs.2.4 million and

Rs.4.3 million, respectively. The IDSs thus contributed

to strengthen the grassroot level community based

organisational infrastructure of the country.

As the fifth step, IDSs were federated to form Isuru

Development District Unions (IDDUs) in order to

continue with Project activities. The IDDUs have

organised fund raising campaigns for awarding

scholarships to children in member families, conducted

trade fairs, hosted sports meets, performed cultural

shows and engaged in other community based events.

These activities have enabled members of IDSs to

increase their family incomes, enhance their children's

education and bring out their hidden talents.

Both IDSs and IDDUs have established a viable

network of members enabling them to harness the

synergic strength of group action. The democratic

process of elections, good governance and transparency

in operations have bound the members together so that

the IDSs can now successfully face challenges that are

posed to them by external forces and ensure sustainable

development.

by participatory credit institutions (PCIs) in 2000 out of

their own funds under the NCRCS amounted to Rs.594

million, an increase of Rs.131 million (28.2 percent) over

the previous year's disbursements. Of the total credit

disbursed, a sum of Rs.370 million was in respect of Maha

1999/2000, while the balance Rs.224 million was in respect

of Yala 2000. The total number of loans granted under the

NCRCS increased from 23,271 in 1999 to 32,339 in 2000.

This substantial improvement was mainly due to many

farmers' becoming eligible to obtain loans under the

NCRCS due to the continuation of the Farmer's Relief

Scheme, which was introduced by the government in 1994.

Under this relief scheme, farmers who had defaulted

repayment of cultivation loans were given the opportunity

to repay 25 per cent of the amount outstanding in default

and become eligible to obtain a fresh loan for the ensuing

cultivation season. The balance 75 per cent was written-off.

Further, the on-lending interest rate under the NCRCS,

which was 12 per cent per annum, attracted farmers as the

rate was lower than other rates in the market. Paddy

continued to be the main crop financed under NCRCS,

accounting for 70 per cent of the credit disbursed in 2000,

while the balance 30 per cent was for the cultivation of

subsidiary food crops.

The interest subsidy provided by the government for

NCRCS loans since 1994 continued. PCIs grant loans to

farmers out of their own funds and receive an interest

subsidy of 10 percentage points from the Treasury in order

to maintain the lending rate at 12 per cent per annum,

which has prevailed since Yala 1998.

In view of the short production cycle, the maximum

period given to farmers for repayment of NCRCS loans was

270 days and PCIs were eligible to claim the interest

subsidy to cover up to that period. During the year under

review an interest subsidy amounting to Rs.40.3 million was

paid by the government in respect of loans amounting to

Rs. 1,736 million that had been granted by PCIs in six

consecutive cultivation seasons from 1996/97 Maha to 1999

Yala.

Relief Package to Fanners

The Farmers' Relief Scheme introduced by the government

in 1994 was also in operation during the year under review.

The government extended the termination date of the

scheme by a further six months, from June 1999 to

December 1999, and PCIs were requested to submit their

claims on or before 31 March 2000.

Under the scheme, farmers have their defaulted loans, including accumulated interest, written-off by banks on payment of 25 per cent of the principal. The balance 75 per cent is shared by the Central Bank (37.5 per cent), lending banks (18.75 per cent), and the government (18.75 percent). Further, this package made them eligible to obtain

fresh loans as borrowers in good standing. The

government's relief package required the Central Bank to

relax its credit guarantee rules by way of waiving the

requirement that a lending bank should institute legal action

in order to be eligible for the full amount of the credit

guarantee. In terms of this waiver, the Central Bank agreed

to pay half of the principal amount in loss remaining after

the down payment of 25 per cent by the farmer.

The total liability of the Central Bank under this

scheme up to the end of 2000 was Rs. 333 million, while

the liability of the government was Rs. 235 million.

Expansion of the Scope of the NCRCS

During the year under review, the scope of the NCRCS was

expanded by including pre-harvest and post cultivation

activities as eligible activities for financing under the

NCRCS. These activities included the production of seed

and planting material on a commercial scale, purchase and

storage of paddy and other agricultural produce by private

organisations, farmer organisations and traders, and the

purchase of agricultural produce by private traders and

companies under the FSC system introduced by the Central

Bank.

Under the extended scope of the NCRCS, the

maximum loan guarantee cover has been enhanced to Rs.2.7

million, whilst the maximum indemnity payable under the

credit guarantee cover was raised to Rs.1.6 million. The

indemnity amounts to 60 per cent of the loan in loss or

the amount guaranteed, whichever is lower. The premium

rate payable for the credit guarantee cover is 2.0 per cent

per annum on the amount of the loan granted.

Rescheduling Facilities to Small Scale Potato Farmers

In view of the difficulties experienced by small scale farmers who borrowed from banks for the cultivation of potatoes in the Nuwara Eliya and Badulla districts during the period 1995/96 Maha to 1997/98 Maha, a package of relief measures was introduced by the government.

Accordingly, PCIs were requested to extend

rescheduling facilities to loans that had been defaulted by

farmers during the period 1995/96 Maha to 1997/98 Maha.

This facility was expected to enable farmers to repay the

outstanding principal balances within a period of four

consecutive cultivation seasons. The Treasury agreed to

reimburse the banks (PCIs) 100 per cent of the accumulated

interest waived up to the date of rescheduling. Suspension

of legal action for the recovery of loans granted for potato

cultivation during 1995/96 Maha to 1997/98 Maha in

respect of non-wilful defaulters and the availability of an

interest subsidy of 10 per cent per annum for loans

rescheduled, by the Treasury, and granting limited credit

facilities under the NCRCS for those who agreed to

2 1 9

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

reschedule the defaulted loans were the other relief

measures provided under the scheme.

A total sum of Rs.13.6 million was reimbursed to the

PCIs in 2000 by the Treasury on account of waiver of

accumulated interest. Of this, the interest payable on loans

under the NCRCS amounted to Rs.8.3 million, while the

balance Rs.5.3 million was on account of interest payable

on loans outside the NCRCS. The Treasury made available

a total of Rs.54.8 million for this purpose.

Subsequent to the above interest waiver, a further relief

measure was introduced by the government for potato

farmers who had defaulted loan repayment during the period

1994 Yala to 1997/98 Maha. The government decided to

write off all loans below Rs.60,000 granted during this

period for potato cultivation and still outstanding. In terms

of this scheme, the defaulting farmers were required to

make a down payment of 25 per cent of the principal in

default, while the balance 75 per cent was to be written

off. This facility was to be implemented by all banks, while

the amounts written off by Kandurata Development Bank

and Uva Development Bank were to be absorbed by the

government.

In the case of potato cultivation loans over Rs.60,000,

all banks were instructed to reschedule the capital of such

loans to be repayable over a maximum period of 36 months

at an interest rate of 8 per cent per annum. The

accumulated interest that was written off was to be

reimbursed by the Treasury.

Crop Insurance Scheme

The Agricultural and Agrarian Insurance Board (AAIB) and

Ceylinco Insurance Company Ltd. (CICL) continued to

provide agricultural insurance cover for paddy, subsidiary

food crops, livestock, etc. during the year under review.

AAIB introduced new insurance schemes for (i) tobacco

cultivation under the Ceylon Tobacco Corporation,

(ii) agricultural projects under FSC system, (iii) seed paddy

and model farming, (iv) tea nurseries and plants under the

Tea Research Institute and the Tea Small Holding Authority

and, (v) the scheme for sesame, kurakkan and maize crops.

AAIB continued the insurance schemes for export

agriculture crops and perennial crops. AIB broadened its

scope by introducing a technical method of loss assessment

for crops such as onion and ground nut. Action has been

taken to introduce new insurance schemes for foliage and

cut flowers, medicinal plants, storage of agricultural

products and medicinal products and a scheme for insuring

agricultural machinery. CICL, which is the only private

insurer operating in this field, expanded its services to

various new sectors under the Agricultural and Agrarian

Insurance Act, No.20 of 1999.

The extent of paddy land insured by AAIB in 2000

amounted to 7,000 hectares (about 2 per cent of the total

cultivated area) when compared to 11,000 hectares in 1999.

This reduction was mainly due to limiting paddy insurance

operations to seed paddy and model farming systems in the

wet zone districts and the total suspension of operations in

Mannar, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi and un-cleared areas of the

Jaffna and Vavuniya districts. The insurance premia

collected during Yala 2000 and 2000/2001 Maha and

indemnities paid under paddy stood at Rs.3.7 million and

Rs.0.6 million (for Yala 2000) respectively. The area

insured under other crops by the AAIB stood at 1,077

hectares. The premia'collected and indemnities paid in this

sector amounted to Rs.2.3 million and Rs.0.1 million. CICL

insured an extent of 2,255 hectares of paddy land in Yala

2000 and collected premia to a value of Rs.2 million.

Indemnity payments made by CICL stood at Rs.1.1 million.

CICL also insured other crops collecting premia of Rs.1.5

million and paying claims to a value of Rs.0.5 million. Both

CICL and AAIB continued providing insurance coverage for

livestock.

Microfinance and Savings Schemes

Samurdhi Development Credit Schemes

Samurdhi Banking Societies (SBSs), which are the ground

level credit and savings associations of the Samurdhi

Movement, continued their activities of mobilising savings,

granting loans and providing other services to Samurdhi

members. At end 2000, 940 SBSs had been set up under

the Samurdhi Act in 252 Divisional Secretariat divisions,

an increase of 75 during the year. An important feature of

SBSs is the active participation of women in the

development process. At end 2000, 65 per cent of the

chairpersons of SBSs were women.

The total number of shareholders of SBSs stood at

1,571,200 at end 2000, an increase of 21.5 per cent during

the year. The value of paid-up capital of SBSs amounted

to Rs.983 million, while member and non-member savings

(including compulsory savings of Samurdhi beneficiaries)

stood at Rs.3,011 million. Almost two thirds (61 per cent)

of the total fund base of SBSs has been invested, while the

balance 39 per cent has been granted as loans to members.

The outstanding loan amounts granted under the SBSs stood

at Rs. 1,359 million showing an on-time recovery rate of

107 per cent as some borrowers had repaid more than the

amount that they required to pay as at the end of 2000.

Close monitoring by the animators and peer pressure within

the groups to maintain a good repayment record has enabled

the achievement of this high rate of recovery. These loans

have been granted to members for starting small-scale

businesses in agriculture, agro processing, small scale

trading, fisheries and for meeting consumption requirements.

Under the Samurdhi Programme, other loan schemes,

namely, Samurdhi Development Credit Scheme (SASANA),

Samurdhi Animators' Credit Programme, Refinance Credit

Programme (PANA), and Samurdhi Leasing Programmes,

were also in operation in 2000. In addition, the Samurdhi

movement introduced a new development programme called

the 'Samurdhi Task Force' for community development

activities. Funds for this programme had been allocated

under the Samurdhi Programme.

Garni Pubuduwa Scheme (GPS)

The GPS, a rural financial scheme of HNB that aimed at

uplifting the living standards of the rural and semi urban

population, completed its eleventh year of operation in

2000. This scheme operates through its wide branch

network of 106 delivery units located in both rural and

semi-urban areas. Financial support has been provided for

establishing over 36,700 self employment projects during

the project period. The cumulative value of loans granted

stood at Rs.1.4 billion at end 2000, while the amount

outstanding stood at Rs.380 million, covering over 10,000

current projects. A special feature of this scheme is that

each unit is assigned a field officer (Garni Pubuduwa

Upadeshaka) who is the link between the borrower and the

bank. Each such field officer has to serve an average

clientele of 100. Under this process, Rs.850 million had

been mobilised as savings deposits up to the end of 2000.

HNB maintained an average recovery rate of 97 per cent

throughout the project period, proving that close

supervision, and follow up can minimise risks in recovering

loans granted in this sector. The scheme also serves the

poor who would otherwise have never entered the

mainstream of the financial sector.

Thrift and Credit Co-operative Societies (TCCS) Credit Schemes

TCCS and SANASA Development Bank (SDB) continued to mobilise savings from and grant loans to their members and customers. TCCS, through their large branch network, mobilised a sum of Rs.948 million from members, while granting loans to a value of Rs.2,235 to their members. The value of issued shares stood at Rs.287 million at end 2000.

SDB mobilised savings from its members and customers to

a value of Rs. 1,017 million and issued shares to members

to a value of Rs.161 million as at end December, 2000.

Both TCCSs and SDB have provided credit for agriculture,

animal husbandry, small industries, rural electrification,

trade and commerce.

Sarvodaya Economic Enterprise Development Services (SEEDS)

SEEDS, which is the enterprise arm of the Sarvodaya

Movement, continued to provide services to its members

through different types of micro type financial products. As

its main functions, SEEDS engaged in providing credit

facilities to members of Sarvodaya Sramadana Societies for

establishing small and micro enterprises, in operating a loan

scheme for low income families to purchase solar power

systems (funded by the World Bank), and operating special

credit schemes funded by donor agencies. SEEDS has been

functioning as a participating agency in the Small Farmers

and Landless Credit Project and Poverty Alleviation Micro-

finance Project. SEEDS aims at establishing 1,000

Sarvodaya Development Bank branches in rural areas by

2003. At end 2000, 393 such development bank branches

had been established. SEEDS had disbursed Rs.748 million

worth of loans as micro-credit and provided 2,078 loans to

members to purchase solar power systems as at end

December 2000. SEEDS had mobilised Rs.626 million as

savings. The recovery rate on loans granted under SEEDS

credit schemes stood at 94 percent at end December 2000.

Farmers' Banking Societies (FBSs)

Farmers' Banking Societies called 'Govi Jana Banku' (GJB) in Sinhala, were established by the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands. Their objective was providing funds for farm requirements and services including good quality seed, fertiliser, agro-chemicals, agro-technology, and support services and financial assistance for small farmers, who form 40 per cent of the total farming community. FBSs are expected to improve the living standards of the target groups by increasing farm income and encouraging the savings habit among the farmers. As at end 2000, 452 FBSs had been established at Agrarian Services Centres (Govi Jana Kendra) with 160,172 shareholder farmers, who were required to buy at least 1 share of Rs.100 in FBSs. The share capital of FBSs stood at Rs.16 million as at end December 2000. Savings of the individual farmers stood at Rs.24.5 million, out of which Rs.18 million was mobilised during the year under review. During 1999/2000 Maha and 2000 Yala seasons, loans to the value of Rs.49.2 million and Rs.41.2 million, respectively, were disbursed for paddy and cash crops. FBSs intend to expand credit facilities to other sectors such as livestock, inland fisheries, food processing and marketing of agricultural products.

Credit and Savings Schemes for Women in Micro-Enterprise Development

Kantha Ran Divimaga

The 'Kantha Ran Divimaga' Scheme was launched by Bank

of Ceylon in August 1997, in collaboration with the

Women's Bureau of Sri Lanka (WBSL) with the objective

of uplifting socio-economic standards and raising income

levels of women. The target group of the scheme were

members of women's societies who were registered with the

WBSL. The project covers the entire island excluding the

Northern Province, since women's societies have not been

established in that region. The Project provides credit, with

a maximum of Rs. 100,000 per individual at an interest rate

of 13.5 per cent per annum, for establishing small scale

industries, trade and business, services, animal husbandry,

agriculture and other income generating activities. Under the

Project, WBSL recommends prospective borrowers to the

Bank. The scheme is also linked to a special savings

scheme called 'Kantha Ran Ginum', which requires

borrowers to make compulsory savings. As at end

December 2000, Rs.18.2 million has been granted to 1,008

members to establish income generating projects.

Janashakthi Banking Societies in Hambantota

Janashakthi Banking Societies (JBSs), which were set up under the Women's Development Federation (WDF) in the Hambantota District, completed the eleventh year of operations in 2000. The objective of the scheme was to empower rural women in the Hambantota District by providing credit and other related services, inculcating savings habits and banking practices, developing sanitation and nourishment practices among them and training for skill development. The main programme includes a wide array of sub-programmes which contribute to achieving the objectives of the programme. The target group of the scheme were women in poor families where the monthly income was less than Rs. 1,500. At end 2000, there were 67 JBSs, comprising 28,168 members, spread out in the area of Suriyawewa, Katuwana, Tissamaharama, Hambantota and Tangalle. The amount deposited by members by way of normal deposits, special deposits and fixed deposits was Rs.29 million. The value of issued shares to the members stood at Rs.17 million. Total loans granted to members during the year under review was Rs.34 million.

Delivery of Rural Credit through the Co-operative Movement

Co-operative Rural Banks (CRBs), which are the banking

arms of Multi Purpose Co-operative Societies (MPCSs),

continued their financial functions and other activities under

the Co-operative Development Department (CDD). The

main functions of CRBs include mobilisation of savings,

extension of credit to their member borrowers for

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report "2000

agriculture and allied activities, fisheries, animal husbandry,

trade and commerce, provision of credit for pawning

activities, collection of utility bills and payment of pensions

to farmers. At the end of 2000, 300 CRBs were in

operation throughout the country with a branch network of

1,476. During the 2000, the value of loans granted by

CRBs amounted to Rs.3,612 million. The deposit level of

CRBs stood at Rs. 14,806 million at end 2000.

Meanwhile, the District Co-operative Rural Banking

Unions (DCRBUs), which were set up as apex bodies of

MPCSs under the CDD, continued their functions of

accepting deposits of MPCSs, investing excess funds

mobilised by MPCSs through CRBs and providing working

capital loans for MPCSs. By end 2000, 14 DCRBUs had

been set up, representing 240 MPCSs.

10.10 Other Financial Institutions

Savings Institutions

National Savings Bank (NSB), the premier savings

institution in Sri Lanka, strengthened its activities by

widening the scope of its activities in a competitive banking

environment. Its activities have become more market

oriented. The total resources of NSB increased by 14 per

cent to reach Rs. 115,102 million at end 2000, reflecting

primarily growth in deposits.

The total deposits of NSB rose by 13 per cent to

Rs. 105,045 million at end 2000. In comparison, savings and

fixed deposits of commercial banks increased by 15 per

cent in 2000. Savings deposits and fixed deposits of the

NSB grew by 2 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively.

Meanwhile, other deposits including National Savings

Certificates, Premium Savings Bonds and the NSB Pension

Scheme, rose by 19 per cent during the year. The

implementation of deposit schemes targeting different

groups in society (e.g., minors, youth), focussing on

customer oriented banking, and opening savings shops,

together with widespread advertising campaigns, frequent

adjustment of interest rates in line with market trends and

increased automation in the bank helped to build up a

strong deposit base. In order to encourage and facilitate

savings mobilisation, the NSB introduced a new concept of

'banking at leisure', and extended banking hours at its three

savings shops.

NSB adjusted its interest rates several times during the year in line with market trends. The savings deposit rates, which was 9.2 per cent in January, was reduced to 8.4 per cent in February and remained at that level through the rest of the year. The rate on 12-month fixed deposits, which was at 11.5 per cent in January was decreased to 10.5 per cent in February, and again increased to 11.5 per cent in June. Thereafter, one year fixed deposit rates were increased gradually to a level of 15 per cent by November 2000.

NSB launched a personal loan scheme and a housing

loan scheme. In addition, the Bank introduced a privilege

card for its 'Ithuru Mithuru' Account holders, who are

youth. The privilege card is a plastic card which enables a

card holder to obtain discounts from commercial and service

institutions specified by the Bank. With the installation of

two ATMs during the year, the total number of NSB ATMs

increased to three at end 2000. More than half of its branch

network has been automated.

The diversification of the NSB's investment portfolio continued with an increase in the holdings of market based instruments. Total investments of the NSB increased by 13 per cent and stood at Rs. 100,853 million at end 2000. The share of investment in Treasury bills and Treasury bonds increased from 30 per cent at end 1999 to 38 per cent of total investments at end 2000. Investments in Treasury bills and Treasury bonds increased by 85 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively. The share of investments in government Rupee loans has gradually declined over the past few years. The share of investments in Rupee loans fell from 56 per cent in 1999 to 46 per cent of total investments in 2000, a reflection of a move towards more market oriented instruments. Investments in debentures, commercial paper and in shares and Units Trusts increased during the year.

The country's main superannuation fund, the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), continued to grow in 2000. The growth of activities of the Fund was accompanied by increases in total contributions, member accounts, total refunds and outstanding member balances. The total contributions received by EPF amounted to

Rs. 17,009 million, a 24 per cent increase in 2000. This, however, included a large sum received as a payment of arrears. The refunds paid to members rose from Rs.7,691

million to Rs. 10,573 million at end 2000. These resulted

in increasing the total member balances, after crediting

annual interest, by Rs.29,154 million. Being the largest

single investor in the country, the total value of investments

at end 2000 was Rs.215 billion, an increase of 16 per cent

during the year. It has invested a major share of its funds

in government paper.

The Employees' Trust Fund (ETF), the country's

second superannuation fund, also showed an increase in its

activities. The total contributions received in 2000 was

Rs.2,928 million compared to Rs.2,665 million in 1999. The

superannuation benefits paid to members during the year

was Rs.1,483 million, an increase of Rs 61 million over the

previous year. The outstanding members' balance in the

ETF was Rs.28,023 million, an increase of 10 per cent over

the previous year. Total investments at end 2000 was

Rs.29,221 million compared to Rs.25,243 million at end

1999. A major share of investments were in government

paper. The investments in government paper increased from

Rs. 17,621 million to Rs.22,476 million at end 2000. Total

assets of the ETF amounted to Rs.29,813 million, an

increase of 17 per cent over the previous year.

Long-term Lending Institutions

DFCC Bank, a Licensed Specialised Bank, continued its

lending activities during the year. Total loans approved by

DFCC Bank amounted to Rs.8,074 million, an increase of

15 per cent over the previous year. The increase was mainly

to agricultural, commercial and financial sectors. However,

the total value of loans disbursed decreased by 12 per cent

during the year. The decrease was seen in loan

disbursements to most sectors.

The majority of the loans disbursed during the year were to the industrial sector (36 per cent of total loans), though the loan disbursements to the industrial sector slowed down during the year. The second major category that received financing from DFCC Bank was the financial sector (24 per cent of total loans). However, loan disbursements to the financial sector decreased by 52 per cent during the year. Total loans granted to the agriculture sector, which holds 8 per cent of total loans granted, decreased by Rs.139 million to Rs.410 million in 2000. DFCC Bank provided 11 per cent of total loans amounting to Rs. 525 million to the commercial sector to finance wholesale and retail trading. Finance facilities provided to the other sectors (19 per cent of total loans), which included community and social services, and electricity, gas and water, increased from Rs.96 million in 1999 to Rs.934 million in 2000.

The total value of loans outstanding increased from

Rs. 15,054 million to Rs. 16,759 million at end 2000. The

majority of loans (53 per cent) were medium-term. Of the

total loans outstanding, about 36 per cent were long-term, while 11 per cent were short-term. The majority of loans (91 per cent) were secured and over. Rs.5 million in size. The bulk of loans and advances had been granted at an interest rate in the range of 14.0 per cent to 19.0 per cent.

The main sources of funds of DFCC Bank during the year were repayment of loans by customers (53 per cent), term borrowings (15 per cent) and lease amortisation (10 per cent). The total asset base of DFCC Bank stood at Rs.24,966 million at end 2000.

National Development Bank, the other major development finance institution, continued to engage in long-term lending activities. However, the lending activities in terms of total loans approved and granted, decreased from the previous year. The total volume of loans approved dropped from Rs. 12,442 million at end 1999 to Rs. 10,077 million at end 2000. Following the same trend, total loans disbursed came down by 42 per cent to Rs.6,826 million in 2000. The decrease was reflected in decreases in credit to industrial, commercial and tourism sectors while there

224

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

were increases in credit to agriculture, financial, housing

and other sectors. Credit to the industrial sector stood at

68 per cent of total loans and advances approved. Total

loans approved to this sector decreased from Rs.8,381

million in 1999 to Rs.6,857 million in 2000. Loan approvals

to the commercial sector decreased by Rs.1,122 million,

while loans to the tourism sector dropped by Rs.540

million. Loans to the agricultural, financial and housing

Rs.25 million, respectively.

Of the total loans, the majority (49 per cent) were medium-term, 36 per cent were short-term and 15 per cent were long-term. The main sources of funds of NDB were repayment of loans by customers (64 per cent of funds), international credit lines (16 per cent of funds) and issue of debentures (11 per cent of funds). The total assets of the bank increased by 12 per cent to reach Rs.41,545 million at end 2000.

Lending activities of the State Mortgage and Investment Bank (SMIB), the leading housing finance institution in Sri Lanka, also showed a downturn during 2000. Total loan approvals decreased from Rs. 1,679 million in 1999 to Rs. 1,522 million in 2000. Following a similar trend, loans extended during the year also dropped by 21 per cent to Rs. 1,376 million. The total loan approvals to the housing sector, which accounted for 98 per cent of total loan approvals, decreased by Rs.102 million during the year. Of the total loan approvals, 86 per cent of loans were long-term, and 13 per cent were medium-term. The majority of loan approvals were secured against property mortgages, fixed deposits and balances in the Employee's Provident Fund. The majority of loans were approved at interest rates of 16.00-18.00 per cent. SMIB revised its lending rates upward in the latter part of the year in line with market trends. The lending rates for the housing sector, which were in the range of 15.00 - 17.00 per cent at the beginning of the year, increased to 16.00 - 18.00 per cent, in December 2000.

The total deposits mobilised by SMIB stood at Rs.3,430 million, an increase of 11 per cent during the year. Interest rates on deposits were gradually revised upward several times during the year. The one year fixed deposit rate, which was 11.50 per cent in February, was increased to 15.00 per cent in November in several steps. The main sources of funds of SMIB were repayment of loans by customers (83 per cent) and fixed deposits (15 per cent). The total assets of SMIB increased to Rs.8,089 million from Rs.7,447 million at end 1999.

Total loans approved by the two private savings and development banks increased from Rs. 1,720 million in 1999 to Rs.1,921 million in 2000. Loans to the agricultural, housing, financial, and other sectors showed an improvement, while loans to industrial,, commercial and tourism sectors showed a decline during the year. Loans to

the agriculture sector increased from Rs.37 million to Rs.134 million. Loans to the financial and housing sectors rose by 25 per cent and 21 per cent, respectively. Loans to the commercial sector, which holds a share of 41 per cent of total loans, decreased by Rs.155 million during the year. Loans to the industrial sector also decreased to Rs.140 million from Rs.211 million in 1999. The major sources of funds of the two banks in 2000 were deposits, borrowings and issue of debentures. Total assets of the two banks increased to Rs.5,082 million, an increase of 14 per cent during the year.

The Housing Development Finance Corporation of Sri

Lanka (HDFC) continued to lend to the housing sector.

Total loans approved stood at Rs.649 million in respect of

2,245 loans, compared to Rs.540 million on account of

3,115 loans in the previous year. The amount of loans

disbursed rose by 6 per cent to Rs.558 million. Of the total

loans approved, 93 per cent were long-term. The majority

of loans were in the range of Rs.l00,000-Rs.400,000 and

were secured against land and property. The major share

of loans carried an interest rate in the range of 15.00-19.00

per cent. The major source of funds for HDFC were

repayment of loans by customers (75 per cent). The

National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) also

extended credit facilities to housing sector. NHDA approved

Rs.3,580 million in 2000 compared to Rs.2,140 million in

the previous year, while total loan disbursements increased

by 26 per cent and stood at Rs. 1,403 million in 2000. The

total number of recipients of loans were 33,000 and all the

loans were below Rs.25,000 with interest rates of 12.00-

16.00 per cent.

Finance Companies

The total assets and liabilities of finance companies (FCs) expanded at a slower rate in 2000 (9.3 per cent) than in 1999 (17.7 per cent). In comparison, total assets of commercial banks rose by 18.7 per cent in 2000 and 13.8 per cent in 1999. Finance company assets amounted to around 5 per cent of the assets of the domestic banking units of commercial banks. The growth rate of deposits of FCs was also lower (9 per cent) than that of commercial banks (14 per cent) in 2000. The slower expansion of assets/ liabilities of FCs may be attributed to the decline in fixed deposits of FCs by 5 per cent from October 2000 to December 2000. The high rates offered on risk free government securities would have contributed significantly to this development. Total outstanding credit extended by FCs also grew at a lower rate (11 per cent) than the rate of commercial banks (17 per cent) in 2000.

Loans and advances continued to be the major category

of assets of FCs, accounting for almost two thirds of total

assets, followed by investments (14 per cent) and fixed

assets (8 per cent). The growth rate of loans and advances

was 11 per cent in 2000 compared to a growth rate of 17

per cent in 1999. By way of comparison, the outstanding amount of loans and advances of domestic banking units of commercial banks grew by 17 per cent in 2000 and 16 per cent in 1999. Within loans and advances, leasing (61 per cent), real estate (9 per cent) and hire purchase (8 per cent) were the main components. Credit for leasing activities increased by 13 per cent, while credit for hire purchase and real estate development dropped by 2 per cent each in 2000.

The investment component of FC assets amounted to 14 per cent, with 60 per cent of the investments being in government securities, primarily in Treasury bills. Investments in Treasury bills increased by 16 per cent. Amongst the other assets, the holdings of cash and bank balances dropped by 25 per cent, while fixed assets rose by 9 per cent.

From the perspective of liabilities, the major component was deposits, accounting for 62 per cent of total liabilities, while capital and reserves provided 15 per cent, other liabilities 11 per cent and borrowings accounted for 7 per cent. Total deposits of FCs increased by 9 per cent in 2000 (19 per cent in 1999), in comparison to an increase

Source: Central Bank of Sri Lanka

of 13 per cent in rupee deposits of commercial banks (13

per cent in 1999). The dependence on borrowings by FCs

moved up by 21 per cent (5 per cent in 1999). The increase

in the exposure to borrowings may be attributed to the slow

down in the growth in deposits. Meanwhile, provisions for

bad and doubtful debt of the total liabilities of FCs was 4

per cent at end 2000 (3 per cent in 1999).

10.11 Specialised Financial Institutions

Merchant Banking

Information was obtained from 13 specialised institutions undertaking merchant banking activity in 2000. As in the previous year, the activities of these institutions slowed down during the year. Total assets of the institutions decreased by 25 per cent and stood at Rs. 18,289 million at end 2000. The industry as a whole suffered a loss of Rs.1,761 million during the year mainly because of heavy losses incurred by a few institutions. The total income of merchant banks decreased from Rs.2,288 million to

Rs. 1,938 million in 2000. Major income sources were leasing, loans and investments in government securities.

accounted for 12 per cent and 21 per cent of total income,

respectively, decreased by Rs.29 million and Rs.37 million,

respectively. Meanwhile, income received from financial

and marketing services and margin trading showed some

improvement during the year.

Leasing Companies

There are five specialised leasing companies engaged in leasing business in Sri Lanka. In addition to specialised leasing companies, many commercial banks and other financial institutions such as licensed specialised banks, finance companies and merchant banks also engaged in leasing activities, indicating a widened scope for leasing activities in Sri Lanka. A noteworthy development relating to the leasing industry that took place in 2000 was the establishment of a regulatory framework for the leasing industry, a long felt need. The Finance Leasing Act, No.56 of 2000 was passed in August 2000 giving powers to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to regulate and supervise finance leasing institutions. Under the new Act, licensed finance institutions and public companies incorporated under the Companies Act, with a minimum issued share or paid up capital as stipulated by the Central Bank, will be able to engage in leasing after obtaining Central Bank approval.

The activities of leasing institutions increased during the year. The total assets of the five specialised leasing companies increased by Rs. 1,848 million to reach Rs.14,168 million at end 2000. Total lease finance provided by the

companies increased from Rs.4,912 million in 1999 to

Rs.5,327 million in 2000. The major portion of lease

finance was for commercial vehicles (60 per cent) and

passenger vehicles (19 per cent). Financing facilities to

these two categories increased by 9 per cent and 20 per

cent, respectively, in 2000. Financing for plant and

machinery also increased, while a decrease was recorded in

financing for office equipment.

With regard to the sectors that received financing, the

trading sector, which held a share of 37 per cent of total

financing, received an increase of Rs. 190 million during the

year. Finance facilities to the transport sector (20 per cent

of total finance) and services sector (20 per cent of total

finance) increased by Rs.164 million and Rs.27 million,

respectively, during the year. Funds received by the

agriculture sector increased by Rs.101 million. However,

leasing facilities enjoyed by the industrial sector and the

construction sector slowed down during the year.

The high cost of funds, increased overdues and

competition from other financial institutions were some

constraints faced by the specialised leasing companies

during the year.

Venture Capital Companies

The total number of venture capital companies (VCCs)

operating in the country remained at seven during the year.

The total assets of VCCs stood at Rs.2,918 million,

showing a marginal increase during the year. As in the past,

VCCs continued to provide long-term funds for the

commencement of new businesses, expansion of existing

ventures, acquisitions and buyouts. The total funds invested

in 2000 was Rs. 1,705 million, an increase of 9 per cent

over the previous year. Investments in equity for

commencement of businesses, which accounted for 47 per

cent of total financing, rose by 3 per cent during the year.

A 38 per cent growth was seen in financing for expansion

of ventures. However, funds for acquisition of ventures and

buyouts decreased from Rs.162 million to Rs.140 million

in 2000. The total number of projects assisted in 2000 was

471, which includes a considerable number of self

employment projects.

Insurance Companies

A new Insurance Act was passed in 2000 to establish a new regulatory framework for the insurance industry. The Regulation of the Insurance Industry Act, No.43 of 2000 provides for the establishment of the Sri Lanka Insurance Board for the purpose of developing, supervising and regulating the insurance industry. The new Act also provides a greater autonomy to the Insurance Board for investment decisions. Under the new Act, a mandatory minimum of 30 per cent and 20 per cent of the life and general reserves, respectively, need to be invested in

227

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

government securities. However, the Board is given powers

to take investment decisions with regard to the rest of the

funds. Another major development that took place in the

insurance industry was relaxing of restrictions on foreign

equity holdings by allowing foreign ownership in insurance

companies upto 90 per cent of share capital.

The insurance industry remained competitive during the

year. The total number of insurance institutions in operation

was nine. A new insurance company, Hayleys AIG

Insurance Co. Ltd., which is a foreign collaboration, was

established in 2000, while Janashakthi Life Insurance Co.

Ltd. and Janashakthi General Insurance Co. Ltd. merged

during the year to form the Janashakthi Insurance Co. Ltd.

The total branch network of insurance companies increased

from 285 in 1999 to 293 in 2000. Net profit before tax of

the companies increased by Rs.40 million during the year,

while total assets rose by 4 per cent to reach Rs.29,817

million at end 2000. A growth was seen in both life

insurance activities and general insurance activities.

The total value of life assurance funds rose by 22 per

cent to Rs.23,799 million at end 2000. The total premium

collected in respect of new business rose by Rs.260 million

during the year. The sums insured on new businesses

increased by 2 per cent and stood at Rs.26,911 million at

end 2000. The total sums insured and total premium

collected in respect of business in force increased by 12 per

cent and 20 per cent, respectively. Total benefit payments

on maturity, death and disability, surrender and other

increased by 8 per cent to Rs. 1,585 million in 2000.

General insurance activities, which include fire insurance, general accident insurance, marine insurance and motor insurance, showed an improvement during the year. Net premia for policies in force with regard to general insurance rose from Rs.5,126 million to Rs.6,147 million. As in the past, motor insurance and general accident insurance were the biggest sectors in the general insurance category. Net premia for policies in force in the motor insurance category and general accident insurance category rose by Rs.171 million and Rs.141 million, respectively. Meanwhile, net premia on fire insurance and marine insurance rose by 33 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively.

10.12 Money Market

Overall Trends

An improvement in the rupee liquidity situation was seen at the beginning of the year 2000, following the reflow of currency withdrawn by the public towards the end of 1999 due to market uncertainties generated by elections, Y2K issue and seasonal factors. However, with increased public sector borrowing and outflows on account of the balance of payments deficit, a shortage of rupee liquidity in the market was seen throughout the year. The Central Bank took necessary steps to bridge the gap in credit to prevent a liquidity crunch in the market by injecting liquidity through reverse repurchase transactions and the purchase of Treasury bills at primary auctions. The statutory reserve requirement in respect of foreign currency deposits not placed abroad was also removed in August, partly to

increase liquidity in the foreign exchange market. This

released US dollars 61 million into the market.

Inter Bank Call Money Market

The shortage of rupee liquidity in the market, particularly

concentrated in some banks, resulted in an increase in

borrowings from the call money market, particularly in the

second half of the year. The total turnover in the call

market increased substantially from Rs.955 billion in 1999

to Rs. 1,365 billion in 2000. Call market rates were

generally around 15 per cent in the first five months of

2000, but increased thereafter as borrowings increased and

monetary policy was tightened, and was 26 per cent at end

2000.

Primary Treasury Bill Market

Despite the decline in the yields on Treasury bills at the

beginning of 2000, the yields rose sharply in the rest of

the year, particularly in the second half, following increased

government borrowing and tightened monetary policy.

Although there was a shortage of rupee liquidity in the

market, only a few auctions were under-subscribed as the

high yield rates with zero risk attracted investors. The total

value of Treasury bills offered in the primary market stood

at Rs. 152,293 million in 2000 compared to Rs. 186,490

million in 1999.

The limit to Treasury bills issues, which is authorised

by Parliament, was increased from Rs. 125,000 million in

1999 to Rs.135,000 million in May 2000. Total Treasury

bills outstanding moved up to Rs. 134,996 million at end

2000 from Rs. 124,996 million at end 1999. There were

seven new issues amounting to Rs. 13,000 million and five

retirements worth Rs.3,000 million during the year.

With a view to maintaining the stability of the money market rates, the Central Bank intervened in the primary market for Treasury bills by purchasing bills at the auction and making reservations from the reissue of bills at primary auctions. Accordingly, the total amount of Treasury bills purchased by the Central Bank during the year was Rs.53,429 million, accounting for 29.3 per cent of total issues, compared to Rs.34,725 million in 1999. Out of these purchases, Treasury bills reserved for the Central Bank amounted to Rs.25,725 million in 2000 when compared to Rs.22,800 million in 1999. However, much of this was subsequently sold in the secondary market. The book value of the Central Bank holdings of Treasury bills (excluding reverse repo transactions) stood at Rs.36,517 million at end 2000 rising from Rs.24,987 million at end 1999.

Central Bank Secondary Market for Treasury Bills

The sales (discounting) of Treasury bills from the secondary

window of the Central Bank amounted to Rs. 14,948 million

in 2000, a substantial increase of Rs.8,122 million compared

to the previous year. Similarly, purchases of (rediscounting)

of Treasury bills also rose, though by a smaller magnitude,

from Rs.1,426 million in 1999 to Rs.2,065 million in 2000.

The discount rates, the rediscount rates and the margins

were changed to assist policy, as described in the section

on interest rates.

Central Bank Repurchase (Repo) Market

The repo and reverse repo windows are the main means by

which the Central Bank conducts its open market

operations. With the decline in rupee liquidity in the

market, the absorption of liquidity through the repo window

declined and the volume of transactions was low. Repo

sales during the year declined to Rs. 110,407 million, when

compared with Rs.307,636 million in 1999. Although the

repo rate was reduced marginally in the early part of the

year, with the tightening of policy it was raised several

times during the year, to end the year at 17.00 per cent.

In-comparison, the repo rate at end 1999 was 9.25 per cent.

Central Bank Reverse Repurchase (Reverse Repo) Market

In contrast to the repo market, the reverse repo market was

very active in 2000, as the Central Bank injected substantial

amounts of rupee liquidity to the market. The reverse repo

facility is open ended, with the reverse repo rate being

determined by the Central Bank and used as an active

instrument for open market operations. Funds are provided

to commercial banks and Primary Dealers on the security

of Treasury bills and Treasury bonds. The usual tenor of a

reverse repo transaction with the Central Bank is overnight.

However, the bank varies this as a policy tool. In June, the

tenor was extended to one month to provide greater stability

to the market. However, by 19 September the tenor had

been reduced to overnight once again. The total value of

reverse repo sales was Rs. 1,717,191 million in 2000, in

comparison to Rs.200,590 million in 1999. Of this liquidity

injection in 2000, Rs. 1,276,654 million was in the second half. However, Treasury bills tended to be replaced by

Treasury bonds as security for obtaining liquidity.

Domestic Foreign Exchange Market

The floating of the exchange rate, which began in 1977

with the move away from a fixed exchange rate regime to

a managed float, evolved further in 2000. (More details on

historical developments are given in Box 1). With a view

to providing greater flexibility to the market in the

determination of the exchange rate, and to reduce pressure

in the exchange market, the Central Bank widened the

margin between its buying and selling rates for the US

dollar several times during 2000. As a result of these

developments, the Central Bank middle rate (i.e. the average

2 2 9

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

of its buying and selling rates) stood at Rs.80.0598 per US

dollar at the end of 2000 as against Rs.72.1150 at end

1999, a depreciation of 9.9 per cent of the rupee against

the US dollar for the year.

A marginal increase in purchases of US dollars by the

Central Bank from commercial banks was observed with the

purchases increasing from US dollars 0.4 million in 1999

to US dollars 2.0 million in 2000. Reflecting the substantial

demand for foreign currency by commercial banks resulting

mainly from the increase in the import cost of fuel and

security related items, commercial banks purchased US

dollars 304 million from the Central Bank in 2000,

compared to purchases of US dollars 58 million in 1999.

The majority of the purchases were made in the latter part

of 2000. Total inter-bank turnover, which stood at US

dollars 2,382 million in the previous year, increased to US

dollars 2,711 million in 2000. Forward transactions also

rose from US dollars 458 million in 1999 to US dollars 620

million in 2000, responding partly to the increase in imports

and partly to greater uncertainty in the foreign exchange

market. Pressure in the exchange market was reduced to

some extent by the removal of the SRR on foreign currency

deposits with commercial banks, which released around US

dollars Rs.61 million held by the Central Bank

Commercial Paper (CP)

Listed companies and other financial institutions such as

merchant banks issue commercial paper with a maturity

period of 3-6 months to obtain short-term funds. They are

usually underwritten, endorsed or guaranteed by a

commercial bank or a merchant bank. These are unsecured

notes and have become popular since their introduction in

1993 as a source of funds in the private sector. The high

interest rates that prevailed in the market for traditional

credit through commercial banks also encouraged the raising

of funds through CPs.

During 2000, total gross issues of CPs, including

reissues, amounted to Rs.14,145 million compared to

Rs. 16,203 million in 1999. Merchant banks issued their own

paper amounting to Rs. 1,040 million and Rs. 1,200 million

on behalf of their clients. Commercial banks supported CPs

issues amounting to Rs. 11,905 million, accounting for 84

per cent of total issues. The bulk of these issues were 3-

month bills. The outstanding value of commercial paper

supported by commercial banks stood at Rs.3,963 million

at end 2000 compared with Rs.4,356 million at end 1999.

The yields on commercial paper were in the range of 12.00-

27.00 per cent per annum in comparison with 11.50-18.00

per cent per annum in 1999.

10.13 Capital Market

Although the share price indices of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) indicated an improvement during the

period from May to June 2000, the year as a whole saw

an overall decline in share prices. Asian as well as major

international markets also declined during the year. Two

main factors had an adverse effect on markets globally. The

first was a fall in the price of technology stocks from

March 2000, as investors began to sell these stocks

considering them to be overvalued. The second was the oil

price hike, which investors feared would cut into company

profits. The decline in share prices at the CSE could be

attributed mainly to the political uncertainty that prevailed

as a result of the general elections held in October, the

uncertainty among market participants regarding the extent

of depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee, and the high interest

rates on fixed income securities. Of the 16 sectors, two

sectors showed a marginal improvement in prices over the

year, while the others declined. The decline in both the

Milanka Price Index (MPI) and the All Share Price Index

(ASPI) was sharper than in 1999. The MPI declined by 25

per cent, to close the year at 698.5, while the ASPI

declined by 22 per cent to reach 447.6 by the end of the

year. Foreign investors continued to be net sellers in the

market in 2000. Total purchases by foreign investors during

2000 amounted to US dollars 19 million, while total sales

by foreign investors amounted to US dollars 63 million,

resulting in a net outflow of US dollars 44 million. The

number of companies listed on the CSE increased from 237

at the end of 1999 to 239 at the end of 2000, with 5 new

listings and 3 delistings during the year. There were two

public issues of shares during the year, by a plantation

sector company which made an offer for sale and an

insurance company which made ah initial public offer

(IPO). Both issues were under-subscribed. There were also

three public issues of debentures.

The issue of market based government bonds further

expanded during 2000. The total outstanding amount of

Treasury bonds increased from Rs. 104,867 million at the

end of 1999 to Rs.204,124 million at end 2000, with total

new issues during the year amounting to Rs. 125,322

million. These Treasury bonds had maturities varying from

2 to 6 years.

Primary Market

There was one IPO during the year, made by Asian Alliance Insurance Co. Ltd., where two million shares were offered at a par value of Rs. 10 each. Meanwhile, an offer for sale of shares was made by Malwatte Plantations Ltd. for four million shares at a par value of Rs. 10 each. Nine companies made rights issues during the year, while fourteen companies made bonus issues. The total value of bonus issues during the year was Rs. 2,541 million, compared with Rs. 858 million in 1999. The total value of rights issues during the year was Rs. 713 million, compared with Rs. 1,008 million in 1999.

22.5 per cent per annum. A parcel of 11,980 debentures

issued by Sri Lanka Telecom carried a floating rate of

interest which was linked to the 6 month Treasury bill rate.

The total amount of debt raised through debenture issues

on the CSE during the year was Rs. 2.9 billion, while the

total value of debentures listed on the CSE during the year

was Rs. 2.1 billion.

Secondary Market

The decline in share prices was sharper in 2000 in

comparison to 1999. The ASPI recorded a decline of 21.8

per cent and reached 447.6 while the MPI declined by 25.4

per cent and reached 698.5 at the end of 2000.

Market capitalisation of the Colombo Stock Exchange

fluctuated over the year along with fluctuations in share

prices. The highest level of market capitalisation during the

year was Rs. 113.1 billion at the end of the first trading

day of the year. The lowest level recorded was towards the

beginning of May, at Rs. 84.9 billion. Although the market

recovered thereafter, with market capitalisation increasing to

Rs. 104 billion by October, the year as a whole saw a

decrease of 21 per cent in market capitalisation. At end

December 2000, market capitalisation stood at Rs. 88.8

billion. Some companies continued to dominate the market

in terms of market capitalisation and the top ten companies

in terms of market capitalisation contributed nearly 40 per

cent of the total market capitalisation at end December

2000. These were John Keells Holdings, Ceylon Tobacco,

Nestle Lanka, Commercial Bank, Hayleys, DFCC Bank,

Hatton National Bank, National Development Bank, Aitken

Spence and Sampath Bank.

Total annual turnover declined, from Rs. 14,293 million in 1999 to Rs. 10,624 million in 2000, while the average daily turnover decreased from Rs. 59 million in 1999 to Rs. 44 million in 2000. The highest monthly turnover of Rs. 1,836 million was recorded in June, while the lowest monthly turnover of Rs. 407 million was in September. Of the sixteen sectors, banking, finance and insurance accounted for the largest share of the total turnover (nearly 40 per cent). The market price earnings ratio declined further from 6.6 at the end of 1999 to 5.2 by the end of 2000.

As in 1999, the total value of sales by foreign

investors exceeded their purchases in 2000. Total purchases

by foreign investors during the year amounted to Rs. 1,445

million (US dollars 19 million), while total sales by foreign

investors amounted to Rs. 4,810 million (US dollars 63

million). Accordingly, the net outflow during the year was

Rs. 3,365 million (US dollars 44 million), compared to a

net outflow of Rs. 902 million (US dollars 13 million),

during 1999.

(a) End of the year

The debt securities market expanded further during the

year. While Sri Lanka Telecom and Suntel raised funds by

way of debenture issues, Eagle Insurance issued dividend

debentures in March. However, the issue of one million

Rs. 1,000 debentures in December 2000 by Suntel Ltd. was

not listed during the year. The issue of one and a half

million Rs. 1,000 debentures in March by Sri Lanka

Telecom was the single largest issue of debt on the CSE.

There was a significant increase in the market capitalisation

of listed debentures on the CSE, from Rs. 4.6 billion at the

end of 1999 to Rs. 5.8 billion at the end of 2000. The

maturity period of these debentures varied from 3 to 7

Sectoral Performance

Only two sectoral price indices improved over the year,

namely, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals sector by 3.4 per

cent and the stores and supplies sector by 6.5 per cent. Of

the 14 sectoral price indices which recorded decreases, the

construction and engineering sector index was the biggest

loser, declining by 37.9 per cent. Other sectors which fell

significantly were diversified holdings (29.8 per cent), hotels

and travel (28.4 per cent), banks, finance and insurance

(28.3 per cent), motors (27.3 per cent), manufacturing (22.4

per cent), plantations (21.5 per cent), investment trusts (19.8

per cent), trading (19.3 per cent) and footwear and textiles

(17.8 per cent).

Although most of the sectoral indices declined during

the year, of the top 10 companies in terms of market

capitalisation, eight recorded improvements in profits for the

first three quarters of 2000, compared to the same period

in 1999. Plantations sector companies also recorded

improvements in cumulative profits at the end of the third

quarter 2000. In other sectors however, many companies

recorded declines in cumulative profits at the end of the

third quarter, particularly in the hotels and travels, land and

property, manufacturing and banks, finance and insurance

sectors.

Regional and Major International Stock Markets

Most international markets also saw a decline in share

prices during the year. In the Asian region, Karachi (KSE

100) improved by 6 per cent, but the share price indices

of most other markets declined. Bangkok (SET) declined

by 40 per cent, Bombay (BSE Sensitive) declined by 18

per cent, Hong Kong (Hang Seng) declined by 7 per cent,

Jakarta (Composite) declined by 37 per cent, Kuala Lumpur

(Composite) declined by 14 per cent, Manila (Composite)

declined by 27 per cent, Seoul (Composite) declined by 45

per cent, Taipei (Weighted Price) declined by 40 per cent

and Singapore (Straits Times) declined by 18 per cent.

Sydney (All Ordinaries) however, recorded a 2 per cent

increase.

Major international markets also experienced an overall decline in prices. Tokyo (Nikkei) declined by 24 per cent, while New York (Dow Jones Industrial Average) and London (FT - SE 100) declined by 6 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively.

Developments in the Market

Some significant changes were made by the CSE during the year with regard to the listing rules and internal systems and procedures relating to listing. These came into effect in November 2000. Along with these changes, steps were also taken to reduce significantly the cost of listing. Accordingly, the CSE now has the authority to approve

listing applications, whereas earlier a dual evaluation

process by both the Securities and Exchange Council and

the CSE was adopted. This change is expected to expedite

the listing process. Also, the merit-based listing rules have

been replaced with a disclosure-based approach to

evaluating listing applications. According to the new rules,

a company may be granted a listing on the CSE by way

of an introduction, for which the only requirement is that

the company should have a minimum of 100 shareholders.

Unlike in the case of an offer for subscription or an offer

for sale of shares, there is no requirement of a public issue

in the case of this new method of obtaining a listing, which

is now available to companies along with the two previous

methods of listing. Further, the public holding requirement

of 25 per cent for main board companies and 10 per cent

for second board companies, in order to qualify for a

listing, has also been removed.

In the case of listing debt securities, the requirements

specified return on investment of shareholder funds, as well

as the requirement of a capital redemption fund, have been

removed. Further, a second board has been introduced for

listing of debt securities, where companies which have been

in business for a minimum of 3 years may apply for a

listing of debt. Also, when applying for a listing, companies

now need to have their applications sponsored only by a

sponsor registered with the CSE, whereas earlier a member

firm of the CSE was required to sponsor any application

for a listing.

Meanwhile, the government announced a series of fiscal incentives for the development of the capital market in the budget proposals for the year 2000. Among the incentives announced were the full liberalisation of foreign investment in the debt market, permitting up to 100 per cent foreign ownership of licensed stock broking firms, permitting foreign ownership of up to 60 per cent of the issued capital in the case of banks and 90 per cent in the case of insurance companies, and permitting foreign investment in units of equity/growth unit trusts where the relevant trust deeds do not permit more than 20 per cent of the total investment to be in government securities.

Another positive development in the domestic capital

market during the year was the issue of ratings by Fitch

Ratings Lanka Limited (formerly Duff & Phelps Credit

Rating Lanka Ltd.), the first credit rating agency in Sri

Lanka, which was established in 1999. Two ratings given

during the year were made public; namely, the rating of SL

AA+ given for the Rs. 1.5 billion debenture issue of Sri

Lanka Telecom and the rating of SL AAA given to John

Keells Holdings Ltd., which was a corporate rating. Up to

now, only local ratings have been given by this agency.

Medium and Long-term Government Securities

Treasury Bonds

During 2000, Treasury bonds continued to be a major

medium-term debt instrument used by the government.

These bonds provide the private sector with medium-term

bench mark interest rates and a risk free yield beyond one

year. Treasury bonds were issued with a maturity period of

2-6 years, while the 2-year callable bonds were issued for

the first time in November 2000. By introducing this new

debt instrument, the government had the option to redeem

them after the first year of issue, on a date prior to

maturity. This provides the government an opportunity to

benefit from future declines in interest rates.

The 'Jumbo' issues, which were introduced in 1998,

continued in 2000. The purpose of these issues was a to

build up a large securities reserve, create a highly liquid

secondary market and lower government borrowing cost.

Under this system, there were 34 series of bonds with 14

series for 2-year bonds, 9 series for 3-year bonds, 3 series

for 4-year bonds, and 4 series each for 5-year bonds and

6-year bonds. Despite the shortfall in liquidity during the

year, all auctions except three, were over-subscribed, as

investors were attracted by high interest rates. In spite of

over-subscription, all bids were rejected at a callable auction

held on 07 December 2000, owing to bid rates being

unacceptably high. Consequent on the high liquidity in the

market and the continuing decline in inflation, the Central

Bank decided to lower the coupon rates for Treasury bonds

by 25 basis points effective from 03 January 2000, with the

coupon rates on all maturities being in the range of 10.75-

11.75 per cent. Treasury bonds with maturities of 2-6 years

were issued in the first half of 2000, only 2 and 3 year

Treasury bonds were issued in second half of 2000. Mixed

movements were seen in yields on Treasury bonds in the

first half of 2000, but yields on bonds rose in the second half, in line with the short and long-term rates in the

financial system. The weighted average yields for 2-year

(including the call option of Treasury bonds), 3-year, 4-

year, 5-year and 6-year Treasury bonds varied within a

range of 12.00-22.19 per cent, 12.02-18.71 per cent, 12.17-

13.05 per cent, 12.46-13.02 per cent and 12.53-13.21 per

cent, respectively during the year.

The total gross value of Treasury bonds issued under

different series stood at Rs. 125,322 million in 2000,

compared to Rs.63,452 million in 1999. Reflecting the

popularity of Treasury bonds as a medium-term investment

instrument, new Treasury bonds issued during 2000

amounted to Rs.99,257 million as against Rs.55,952 million

in 1999. Accordingly, the total value of outstanding

Treasury bonds stood at Rs.204,124 million at end 2000,

compared to Rs. 104,867 million as at end 1999.

Special issues amounting to Rs.35,500 million were made to the two state commercial banks and institutional investors during the year. This included the special issues of Treasury bonds amounting to Rs.24 billion in May and June 2000, to the two state banks by the Treasury in order to set off some of the liabilities of the government to those banks.

Rupee Loans

The Rupee Loan Programme (RLP) continued to be an

important source for medium and long-term government

borrowings. Under this scheme, there were 15 rupee

securities floated during the year with the total subscriptions

for these loans amounting to Rs.42,211 million in

comparison to Rs.22,985 million in 1999. Rupee loans are

sold at par and carry a fixed rate of interest. The rate is

administratively determined, based on market trends in

interest rates. These loans were floated with tenors of 1-

year, 5-6 years and 8-10 years and carried interest rates of

11.90 per cent, 11.00 per cent and 12.00 per cent,

respectively. In 2000, EPF and NSB continued to be the

major subscribers to the RLP, accounting for 97.6 per cent

of total subscriptions.

During the year, total rupee loans amounting to Rs. 40,378

million were repaid at maturity, resulting in an increase in the

outstanding rupee loan level from Rs. 262,056 million at end

1999 to Rs. 263,889 million at end 2000.

Unit Trusts

The total number of Unit Trusts (UTs) remained unchanged

at 12 at end December 2000. These included three growth

funds, four balance funds, four income funds and one index

fund. A downturn was observed in the performance of the

industry. For the industry as a whole, the combined Net

Asset Value (NAV) dropped by 18 per cent in 2000, in

comparison to a decline of 1 per cent recorded in 1999. A

slight drop was recorded in the number of unit holders, as

well as in the number of units in issue.

The downturn in Unit Trusts may be attributed

particularly to the setback in the stock market, since a large

portion of the investment portfolios of these funds are in

equities. In terms of the performance of the different types

of funds, the combined NAV of growth funds and balance

funds dropped by around 20 per cent each in 2000, in

comparison to a 4 per cent drop recorded in 1999. About

73 per cent and 61 per cent of the total investment

portfolios in these funds, respectively, were in shares. The

combined NAV of income funds also declined by 3 per

cent at end December, 2000, in contrast to a 20 per cent

increase in 1999. This may be attributed to the redemption

of Treasury bills in some income funds during 2000. Out

of the total investments of income funds, 47 per cent were

invested in government paper while 53 per cent were

invested in other income yielding instruments, such as

repurchase agreements, debentures, commercial paper and

asset backed notes, in 2000.

In response to volatility in the market, fund managers

of growth funds as well as balance funds took steps to

diversify their investment portfolios in order to improve the

performances of these funds, minimising possible losses to

unit holders. Accordingly, in growth funds, the equity

exposure, which was around 83 per cent of total

investments in 1999, was reduced to around 73 per cent at

end December 2000. Similarly, in balance funds, the equity

exposure, which was around 69 per cent of total

investments in 1999, has been contained to around 61 per

cent in 2000. Correspondingly, investment in instruments

such as government paper and other market instruments,

was raised by around 10 per cent during 2000.
