7. POPULATION, LABOUR FORCE AND EMPLOYMENT

7.1 Overview

The rate of growth in the mid year population continued

to rise in 2000, a trend observed since 1998. This was a

combined outcome of both a natural increase in population

(i.e., births minus deaths) and net migration (i.e., arrivals

minus departures). The household labour force at the end

of the third quarter of 2000 was estimated at 6.7 million,

recording a labour force participation rate of 49 per cent.

Meanwhile, about 260,000 jobs were generated during the

first three-quarters of 2000, raising the total employment

from 91 per cent of the labour force in 1999 to 92 per cent

during 2000. Employment grew in both the private and the

public sectors. The unemployment rate declined from 9 per

cent in 1999 to 8 per cent in 2000. However, the share of

the public sector employment in total employment decreased

further in 2000, the private sector continuing to be the

major employment generator. In 2000, foreign employment

placements were around 166,000. However, high

unemployment among educated youth continued to be an

alarming problem due to a mismatch with the labour

market, thus signifying the urgent need for educational

reforms in the country.

7.2 Population

The mid year population in 2000, has been estimated at

19.36 million, showing a mid year population growth of 1.7

per cent, compared with a growth of 1.4 per cent in 1999.

Both the natural increase in the population and net

migration contributed to the higher population growth. The

natural increase in the population amounted to 230,000

persons in 2000, up from 209,000 in 1999. Meanwhile, net

migration was 87,000 persons in 2000 compared to 60,000

in the previous year. Thus, the total addition to the mid

year population, i.e., the natural increase in the population

plus net migration, was estimated at 317,000 persons. The

population density, which is defined as the number of

persons per square kilometer of land, increased marginally

to 309 in 2000 from 304 in 1999.

For the years between two censuses, the Registrar General's Department estimates mid-year population based on population census data, the Registrar General's vital statistics on births and deaths and migration data. Although population censuses have usually been held every 10 years in Sri Lanka, the last population census was held in 1981. The latest will be completed in 2001.

(c) Provisional

According to the World Development Report 2000, the

average annual population growth rate in Sri Lanka was

well below that of most of the countries in the South Asian

region due to a demographic transition, together with

improvements in other socio-economic conditions that have

taken place in recent years.

However, the addition of around 200,000 to 300,000

persons annually to the population of the country continued

to impose a burden on its limited resources. Complicating

this problem, the share of the age group of 55 years and

above in the total population continued to increase at a

faster rate than the age group of 14 years and below. The

continued increase in the share of the older age group

warns of potential problems related to ageing of the

population. Unemployment, high dependency ratios, land

fragmentation, high cost of social welfare such as education,

health and housing and problems associated with an ageing

population are some of the socio economic issues associated

with the current structure and trends in population that need

to be addressed urgently. In particular, the ageing of the population needs to be addressed through a well-planned social security system, to avoid a deterioration of living standards of the aged, without imposing excessive burdens on the working population.

7.3 Labour Force

The labour force in a given reference period is defined as persons aged 10 years and over who are able and willing to work. According to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics, the household labour force at the end of the third quarter of 2000 was 6.7 million, showing a labour force participation rate (the ratio of labour force to household population aged 10 and above) of 49 per cent, compared with 51 per cent in the third quarter of 1999 and 52 per cent in the previous quarter of 2000. The labour force participation rate has varied within a range of 48 and 52 per cent during 1990-2000, 52 per cent being the rate in 1990. The rate declined up to 1997, but rose once again to 52 per cent in 1998.

This turnaround in the labour force participation rate

in 1998 was partly due to the expansion of the data

coverage by the Department of Census and Statistics by

including further categories of unpaid family workers in the

labour force from that year. Most unpaid family workers

are employed in the agriculture sector. Thus, the decline

in the labour force participation rate in the third quarter of

2000 could be partly attributed to seasonal factors, i.e., a

lack of agricultural activity during that period. The decline

in the share of unpaid family workers from the second to

the third quarter of 2000 was 2.9 percentage points, in

comparison to 1.2 percentage points in comparable periods

in the previous year.

7.4 Employment

According to the definition adopted in the Quarterly Labour

Force Survey of the Department of Census and Statistics,

a 'currently' employed person was one who worked for

pay, profit or unpaid family gain for one hour or more

during the week preceding the survey. Employees who were

temporarily absent from work due to factors such as illness,

bad weather and labour disputes were considered as

employed. According to the survey definition, public and

private sector employees, employers, the self-employed

(own account workers) and unpaid family workers form the

broad categories of the employed.

The percentage of labour force in employment

continued to increase during the first three-quarters of 2000.

The total employed rose from 84 per cent of the labour

force in 1990 to 92 per cent during the first three-quarters

of 2000. Manufacturing, agriculture, trade and hotels,

finance, insurance and real estate and construction were the

key areas of employment generation. According to the

Board of Investment of Sri Lanka, about 41,000 new

employment placements were generated from BOI approved

projects during 2000. The textiles, wearing apparel and

leather products, services and horticulture sectors generated

about 30,000 new employment placements, accounting for

around 73 per cent of the total employment generated in

BOI projects. .

The share of public sector employment in total

employment decreased in 2000, continuing its declining

trend. Its share declined from 21.5 per cent in 1990 to 13.6

per cent in the first three quarters of 2000. The private

sector remained the major contributing factor for

employment generation with the faster expansion of its

economic activities. The declining share of the public

sector (government and semi-government) in total

employment also reflects the restructuring and ongoing

privatisation programmes of semi-government institutions.

However, according to the Public Sector Employment

Survey conducted by the Central Bank, which covered the

central government, local governments and provincial

councils and semi-government institutions such as state

corporations, boards and authorities, employment in the

public sector increased by 3.2 per cent to around 1,160,000

in 2000. Public sector employment expanded by around

36,000, the major contributor being employment in

government institutions, which showed an increase of

34,500. Significant increases were noted in defence

personnel, teachers and Samurdhi workers. Employment in

semi-government institutions increased marginally by about

1 per cent to around 300,000 in 2000.

7.5 Unemployment

The unemployment rate upto the third quarter of 2000 remained below the 1999 level, as both private sector and public sector employment grew. The rate of unemployment, which had declined from 15.9 per cent in 1990 to 8.9 per cent in 1999, was 7.7 per cent during the first three-quarters of 2000. The estimate of the

unemployment rate has had some downward bias since

1998, due to increased coverage of unpaid family workers

as employed persons in the labour force. However, the

declining trend in unemployment is apparent even when the

rate is adjusted to exclude unpaid family workers. The

adjusted unemployment rate was 8.7 per cent in 2000

compared to 10 per cent in 1999, which indicated an

equivalent decline of more than one percentage point from

1999 to 2000. Furthermore, employed and unemployed

persons were also identified in the Quarterly Labour Force

Survey based on labour force activities of persons during

a one-year reference period. According to this definition,

a person was considered 'usually' unemployed, if he/she

had no employment for a period of twenty-six weeks or

more during the period of twelve months preceding the

survey. The relevant unemployment rate corresponding to

this definition declined from 17.4 per cent in 1990 to 8.4

per cent during the first three-quarters of 2000.

The female unemployment rate continued to decline at

a somewhat faster rate than the male unemployment rate.

The female unemployment rate declined from 23.4 per cent

in 1990 to 13.0 per cent in 1999 and 11.0 per cent during

the first three quarters of 2000, whereas the male

unemployment rate fell from 11.8 per cent in 1990 to 6.7

less among those with lower qualifications. Higher

unemployment among the educated is partly an outcome of

the conventional education system with its traditional

subjects which has failed to cater to the emerging private

sector labour market demand for persons qualified in

computer science, finance, management and marketing with

a sound knowledge of English. The educational reforms

introduced recently are expected to address the issue of the

high incidence of unemployment among the educated by re­

orienting secondary and higher education systems to meet

the changing manpower demands, particularly in the private

sector.

per cent in 1999 and 5.9 per cent during the first three quarters of 2000. This sharp decline could be attributed to growing employment opportunities for females mainly in manufacturing, agriculture and the trade and hotel sectors in recent years.

With regard to the age-wise unemployment, there has

been a significant decrease in the unemployment rate for

the age group 15-19 years since 1999. The unemployment

rate for this age group was 22.0 per cent during the first

three-quarters of 2000 compared to 40.1 per cent in 1990.

Further, this age group showed a sharper decline compared

to the decline from 30 per cent to 18 per cent in the 20-

29 age group during the 1990 to 2000 period. There was

a high incidence of unemployment among persons with

GCE (A/L) qualifications and above in the age group of

20-29. The unemployment rate among persons with GCE

(A/L) qualifications and above was 14.6 per cent during the

first three quarters of 2000. The rate of unemployment was

7.6 Foreign Employment

Foreign employment placements registered with the Sri

Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) declined to

around 166,000 in 2000 compared with around 178,000 in

1999, recording a decrease of around 12,000. This decline

was in contrast to the increase of about 18,000 in 1999.

According to SLBFE, the decline in foreign employment

placements was probably due to two Ramazan periods

taking place in the year 2000.'Demand for migrant workers

during the Ramazan period declines due to a lower level

of activity in the Middle Eastern countries during this

period. The share of employment placements through

licensed agents increased from around 120,000 in 1999 to

127,000 in 2000. The percentage share of persons placed

in employment through licensed agencies rose to 76 per

cent in 2000 from 68 per cent in 1999. This increase could

be attributed to higher confidence in licensed agents by

migrant workers due to regularisation and supervision

of licensed agents by the SLBFE. According to the SLBFE,

there were 29 recognised private training agents in operation

by end 1999. However, due to irregularities in training

provided by some of these private training agencies, the

SLBFE adopted a policy decision in 2000 to conduct

training programmes for migrant workers on its own.

Nevertheless, as the demand for training could not be fully

met by the SLBFE, the services of 8 private training agents

were also obtained during 2000.

The SLBFE continued to provide a number of support

facilities for registered migrant workers and their families.

These included arrangement of housing and self-

training facilities and an insurance scheme for migrant

workers and their family members.

Since 1997, a service agreement system between

employer and employee has been in place in some countries

to ensure security and better working conditions for female

migrant workers. This system which is co-ordinated by the

SLBFE, was in place in 12 countries by end 2000 with the

support of the embassies of those countries. During 2000

as well, the SLBFE continued to disburse .compensation

payments to Sri Lankan workers displaced from Kuwait by

the Gulf War in 1990.
