8. FISCAL POLICY AND BUDGETARY OPERATIONS

8.1 Overview and Policy Strategy

The recent fiscal policy strategy has been formulated with

a view to improving macroeconomic stability, increasing

investment and saving in the economy, promoting

employment and alleviating poverty. Fiscal reforms have

aimed at moving towards a simple, low rate, non-

distortionary tax system and the rationalisation of

expenditure through curtailment of wasteful and non-priority

expenses, public enterprise reforms and restructuring of

public debt. In line with these policies, the Budget 2000

was designed to further consolidate the fiscal improvements

achieved in 1999. However, the achievement of fiscal

targets expected in the Budget 2000 was made extremely

difficult by two major unfavourable developments; enhanced

defence expenditure and increased oil prices in the

international market. Consequently, a marked deterioration

in fiscal indicators during the year 2000 reflected a veering

off from the fiscal consolidation path established in the

recent past.

High crude oil prices in the international market,

coupled with bearish prospects for the sale of Sri Lanka

Telecom (SLT) shares in the international market, were

some external factors underpinning the poor fiscal

performance. Large outlays on unanticipated defence

expenditure were mainly responsible for the instability

brought about by the domestic environment. High crude oil

prices resulted in increasing the cost structure of some

public enterprises. This in turn necessitated the upward

revision of most administered prices in the economy. The

price revisions, which imposed a burden on consumers,

resulted in another wave of fiscal policy measures aimed

at providing relief to selected segments of the population.

The lacklustre revenue performance also contributed to the

budgetary problem. In spite of corrective revenue and

expenditure measures taken to arrest the destabilising impact

of enhanced military expenditure, the budgetary outlook for

2000 worsened. Consequently, the budget outturn for 2000

reflected a slippage in terms of fiscal performance.

The overall deficit of the budget in 2000 rose to 9.9

per cent of GDP from 7.5 per cent in 1999 as against a

target of 7.6 per cent in the original budget. The increase

in the fiscal deficit was due to a shortfall in revenue

mobilisation and higher outlays incurred largely on account

of recurrent expenditure. Revenue as a percentage of GDP

decreased to 16.8 per cent of GDP from 17.7 per cent in

1999, while current expenditure increased to 20.3 per cent

of GDP in 2000 from 18.7 per cent of GDP in the previous

year. On the revenue front, lower collections were

experienced in both tax and non-tax sources. The escalation

of defence activities in May 2000 largely contributed to the

rise in the current expenditure of the government. The

combined outcome of a lower revenue mobilisation and a

higher current expenditure resulted in the current account

deficit of the budget increasing to 3.4 per cent of GDP in

2000 from 1 per cent of GDP in the previous year. This

was in contrast to a savings of 0.6 per cent of GDP

anticipated in the original budget estimates. Public

investment was maintained at 6.4 per cent of GDP in 2000.

The higher deficit for 2000 was financed mainly through

domestic borrowings, which increased from 6.8 per cent of

GDP in 1999 to 9.4 per cent of GDP in 2000 - the highest

recorded value for domestic borrowings in the recent past.

Borrowings from the banking sector increased from 2.4 per

cent of GDP in 1999 to 4.3 per cent of GDP in 2000. The

need to resort to bank financing was partly due to an

unfavourable external environment, which prevented the sale

of SLT shares as originally planned.

The deterioration in the fiscal sector resulted in a

worsening of other macroeconomic fundamentals in the

economy. The higher deficit of the government was

reflected in a worsened current account position of the

balance of payments. In the context of limited capital

mobility, the fiscal expansion also contributed to the

depreciation of the currency. In the monetary sector, higher

government borrowings from the Central Bank contributed

towards increasing reserve money although the impact of

this was offset by a sharp shortfall in external assets. The

enhanced demand for domestic funds by the government

together with the increased borrowing requirement by public

corporations mainly due to high oil import prices, exerted

upward pressure on domestic interest rates. The yield rates

on market determined government securities rose to

unprecedented levels with the yield on two-year Treasury

bonds rising to 22 per cent during the year.

The policy implications of this fiscal outturn lie in its

deviation from the medium term fiscal policy strategy

announced in the Budget 2000. This strategy envisaged a

lower budget deficit of 7.6 per cent of GDP in 2000 with

gradual budgetary consolidation through a progressive

reduction in the deficit in the subsequent years; 6 per cent

of GDP in 2001 and 5 per cent of GDP in 2002. The lower

deficit was expected to come from fiscal adjustment

measures aimed at improving the revenue elasticity of the

tax system, containing recurrent expenditure and prudent

cash management practices. These measures together were

expected to generate a surplus in the current account of the

budget amounting to 2.5 per cent of GDP in 2001 and 4

per cent of GDP in 2002. Meanwhile, public investment

1 3 0

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

was expected to increase to 8.8 per cent of GDP by 2002,

thereby restoring its status as an important partner in the

country's long-term development.

The government in the year 2000 adopted a two

pronged approach in its taxation strategy whereby revenue

mobilisation and the rationalisation of the tax structure

constituted the focal areas for policy action. While revenue

mobilisation was intended to address the issue of

macroeconomic stabilisation, the government continued with

rationalisation of the tax structure with a view to removing

the structural constraints in the economy.

Structural constraints imposed by the tax system that

hamper the growth of the economy were addressed through

the rationalisation of the tariff system. Adjustments were

made to the import tariff structure with a view to reducing

the bias afforded to international trade through the tax

system. As a heavy reliance on external trade taxes can

impede an economy's capacity to develop new technologies,

thus hampering growth prospects by reducing the exposure

of domestic industries to international competition, the tariff

reforms constituted a step in the right direction. Thus, the

three band tariff structure introduced in 1995 consisting of

tariff rates of 10, 20 and 35 per cent, was reduced to a two

band rate structure of 10 and 25 per cent. The maximum

tariff rate, which was fixed at 30 per cent in 1999, was

lowered to 25 per cent in 2000. The 25 per cent rate band

applied to finished products while the 10 per cent tariff was

imposed on intermediate goods. However, the import duty

rate on selected agricultural products was maintained at a

higher rate of 35 per cent in order to provide protection to

local farmers.

In order to simplify the taxation of petroleum products, the import duty on crude oil was replaced with an excise duty on finished petroleum products. Accordingly, with the removal of the import duty on crude oil in February 2000, an excise tax of 45 per cent was imposed on diesel, kerosene and petrol. This measure simplified the taxation of petroleum products by unifying the hitherto existing excise rates of 15 percent, 50 per cent and zero per cent levied on diesel, petrol and kerosene, respectively. In November 2000, the excise duty rate on these three products was revised downward to 35 percent.

With the downward revision and the simplification of

the tariff structure, the government during the year 2000

also resorted to fine tuning the tariff system with a view

to enhancing protection afforded to local manufacturers and

farmers. The import duty waiver on edible oil was lifted

in March 2000 and a surcharge of 25 per cent imposed in

addition to an import duty of 25 per cent for protecting the

coconut sector. The 5 per cent import duty maintained on

maize was raised to 10 per cent in order to rationalise the

duty rates. The customs duty on cement, which was unified

at a rate of 10 per cent in February 2000, was raised to

25 per cent in June 2000 for selected categories in order

to facilitate the restructuring of the domestic cement

industry. A surcharge at an ad-valorem rate of 35 per cent

was imposed on imported potatoes for a period of three

months from end August 2000 ad-walorem to end

November 2000 to enhance the protection provided to local

farmers. In December 2000 the import duty on potatoes was

replaced with a specific duty of Rs.20 per kg and the

surcharge removed. The import of rice was brought under

licensing requirements in July 2000 with a view to

alleviating the problems encountered in marketing the

domestic supply of paddy/rice.

In order to improve the elasticity of the tax structure,

the government took steps to rationalise the plethora of tax

concessions given to both the BOI and the non-BOI sectors.

The investment tax allowance, under which the cost of

investment was permitted to be set off against the

assessable income of a person, ended in March 2000.

However, as the balance unutilised portion of investment

costs was permitted to be carried forward, the revenue

implications of this measure would be felt in the future.

Moreover, the grant of new tax holidays under the advanced

technology package for new companies and existing

undertakings expired on 1 April 2000. The advanced

technology package consisted of tax holidays and the

facility for duty free imports for industries utilising

advanced technology.

With regard to the BOI sector, the government took

steps as proposed in the Budget 2000, to rationalise

concessions given to BOI enterprises. Prior to 1994, non-

export oriented BOI enterprises we're granted permission to

import project related capital goods free of customs duty

for an indefinite period. However, with the 2000 Budget,

duty free imports of project related capital goods by non-

export oriented BOI enterprises were restricted to the

project implementation period. In the case of non-export

oriented BOI enterprises who already avail themselves of

this facility, the restriction applied from 31 March 2001.

Moreover, the facility for the import of duty free vehicles

for the replacement of existing vehicles by BOI companies

was also withdrawn with effect from January, 2000. In

addition, the government also ended in January, 2000 the

facility to import luxury vehicles on a duty free basis for

BOI enterprises.

In order to streamline the incentive structure and

ensure that incentives are available only to priority sectors,

while minimising revenue leakages, the Budget 2000

proposed the imposition of minimum investment limits for

all incentive categories available under Section 17 of the

BOI law. In addition, incentives applicable for regional

industrialisation in the form of 5 and 8 year tax holidays

were to be granted only to enterprises locating within

industrial parks or Export Processing Zones (EPZs)

1 3 1

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

designated as preferred or most preferred. Moreover, the

Budget 2000 also proposed the rationalisation of BOI

incentives available for large scale projects, which, prior to

1996, constituted a 10 year tax holiday for a minimum

investment of Rs.500 million regardless of export

orientation. The 2000 Budget 'proposed to limit this facility

to flagship companies, which are enterprises with an

investment exceeding Rs.3,500 million. For non-export

oriented projects with investments in the range of Rs.500

million to Rs.3,499 million, a concessionary tax rate of 15

per cent was proposed in place of the tax holiday. The

minimum investment criteria for investments approved

under Section 17 of the BOI Law and the incentives

applicable for regional industrialisation, and large scale

projects are at present being reviewed by the BOI.

Tax incentives in the form of qualifying payments and

tax holidays were introduced in 2000 with a view to

promoting savings, encouraging specified sectors and

improving productivity. In order to encourage contractual

savings among self-employed persons and middle income

families, qualifying payments, which constitute deductible

expenditures from taxable income, were introduced in

respect of premia paid for life and medical insurance

policies from April 2000 onwards. The qualifying payment

is restricted to a sum of Rs.25,000 or one-third of

assessable income, whichever is less. With a view to

promoting the national film industry, incentives were also

granted to the local film industry by way of a qualifying

payment allowing the full cost of production of a film to

be deductible.

Meanwhile, the qualifying payment introduced in the

1998 Budget for the purchase of new shares of a BOI

company engaged in infrastructure development and a BOI

sponsored two-tier hospital venture which provides free as

well as fee based health services continued up to end March

2000. In the case of an infrastructure company, the tax

relief applies to enterprises with an issued share capital of

not less than Rs.300 million and an investment exceeding

Rs.500 million.

The information technology industry has also been

identified for promotion with the grant of a five year tax

holiday for the establishment of information technology

training institutes located outside the District of Colombo

subject to a minimum requirement of 300 students being

trained each year. Meanwhile, concessions made available

in the 1998 Budget to promote software industries continued

in 2000. Incentives provided through the 1996 Budget for

the acquisition of advanced technology were also continued

for a further period of two years.

In order to enhance professional skills and improve productivity, the government also allowed the expenses incurred on the cost of technical training including travel costs to be treated as a cost incurred in the production of

income and therefore to be made deductible in arriving at

statutory income.

The year 2000 witnessed the implementation of several

measures aimed at enhancing the revenue mobilisation

effort. These included the increase in the rate of the

National Security Levy (NSL) and the expansion of its

coverage to most services, the removal of the exemption

granted to timber, cement, all varieties of meat and LP gas

(cylinders above 15 kg) under the Goods and Services Tax

(GST) and the increase in excise taxes on cigarettes and

liquor. The escalation of defence expenditure in the early

part of the year required the government to undertake

several measures to sustain the revenue momentum, while

maintaining budgetary targets. Therefore, in May 2000, the

government raised the NSL rate to 6.5 per cent from the

5.5 per cent levied earlier. Simultaneously, excise taxes on

cigarettes and liquor were also raised to meet the additional

need for war expenditure. While the excise rate on

cigarettes was increased by an average of 20 per cent

during the year, the excise tax on liquor was increased by

Rs.10 per bottle. Meanwhile, the Budget 2000 also

expanded the coverage of the NSL to include most services

in the tax net. Therefore, most services with a quarterly

turnover exceeding Rs. 100,000 were made liable to NSL

from February, 2000. However, services such as the supply

of electricity, water, transport of goods or passengers,

leasing of moveable property, educational services, repair

services (if GST registered) and medical services were

excluded from this chargeability with a view to minimising

the potential adverse impact of increasing the NSL rate.

Moreover, with a view to strengthening the base for

taxation of the GST, the government in February 2000,

extended the coverage of GST to include the supply and

import of revenue generating items such as timber, cement

(including clinker), LP gas and meat. However, in order to

reduce the cost of essential services, educational services

and passenger transport services with a seating capacity in

excess of 30 passengers were granted GST exemption status

with effect from July 2000. The exemption granted to

passenger transport services coverage of leasing facilities for

such motor coaches.

The 2000 Budget also took several steps to improve tax administration and tax payer compliance. The 5 per cent withholding tax deducted at source from payments made to professionals on fees and similar services was extended to all services including payments made to corporate bodies and other businesses. However, the expansion of this mechanism to all businesses has led to some tax administration problems and it is proposed to impose in

2001, a threshold for businesses in this regard. The collection point for stamp duty in the case of imports was also transferred from commercial banks to the Customs Department in April 2000 with a view to facilitating tax administration further.

The government continued its efforts in liberalising the financial sector in 2000. The prevailing restrictions on foreign equity holdings in the banking and insurance sectors were relaxed by allowing foreign ownership up to 60 per cent in banking institutions and -90 per cent in insurance. The increase in foreign equity ownership is expected to improve the capital base and encourage foreign fund flows and help develop Colombo as a regional financial centre. Non-nationals were also permitted to hold 100 per cent stakes in stock broking firms licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from 2000 onwards. With a view to revitalising unit trusts, the government permitted investments by non-residents in units of equity/growth unit trusts where relevant trust deeds do not permit more than 20 per cent investment in government securities. Such investments are to be routed through the Share Investment External Rupee Accounts (SIERA) to ensure the monitoring of inflows and outflows of funds. In order to expand and diversify investments of venture capital companies, the government amended the law for venture capital companies to opt out of the tax holiday period, which was hitherto linked to investments in specified risk ventures. This move enabled venture capital companies to make investments of their own choice.

With a view to modernising the insurance sector and revamping the insurance industry in Sri Lanka, the Regulation of the Insurance Industry Act No.43 of 2000 was passed by Parliament in August, 2000. The Act provides for the establishment of an Insurance Board for the purpose of developing, supervising and regulating the insurance industry. By repealing the hitherto existing Control of Insurance Act, No. 25 of 1962, the new act establishes a platform for the development of a modern regulatory environment for the insurance industry in Sri Lanka. The Board is empowered and responsible, among other things, to register persons carrying on insurance business as insurers, register insurance brokers, advise the government on the development of the insurance industry and implement policies of the government with regard to insurance.

Action on pension reforms has continued in 2000 with the appointment of a committee on pensions and the adoption of a draft bill to regulate private sector superannuation schemes. The proposed Superannuation Benefit Funds Regulatory Commission aims at protecting the savings of employees, ensure that such savings are invested in a prudent manner, ensure the viability of the superannuation funds and promote such funds by increasing public confidence in such benefit schemes. A Committee on Pensions has been appointed with a view to developing an appropriate pension policy for Sri Lanka, taking into consideration pension policies and superannuation schemes in countries with similar economic and social conditions as Sri Lanka. Moreover, the terms of reference of this

committee includes exploring the possibility of

amalgamating and simplifying numerous pension schemes

with a view to designing a simplified social security scheme

for public servants while establishing a sustainable W & OP

fund. Recommendations are also expected to be made with

regard to the rectification of pension anomalies.

The Budget 2000 further revitalised the economy by

liberalising the petroleum sector. Activities of the petroleum

sector were opened to private enterprises. With the opening

of the lubricant market to the private sector in 1999, the

import and distribution of lubricant oil was made more

competitive during the year. The LP gas monopoly was also

terminated in December, 2000 and the market opened up

for competition in gas production, import and distribution.

The opening of these activities to the private sector is

expected to increase the competitiveness of Colombo as an

air and sea travel hub in the region.

The intensified defence activities in the North and East

of the country necessitated the government to increase

defence expenditure. Accordingly, an additional sum of

Rs.28 billion was provisioned for defence expenditure in

excess of the budgeted military expenditure for the year.

In the context of large expenditure overruns in respect of

national security and defence, the government re-prioritised

its public expenditure programme with a view to containing

the budget deficit. Thus, expenditure on nonessential capital

transactions such as outlays to be incurred for the purchase

of vehicles, construction of new buildings and purchase of

furniture and equipment was pruned. The budgetary

provisions made available for foreign funded development

projects were not subject to these cutbacks. In order to

accommodate this expenditure increase and avoid cash flow

problems stemming from possible revenue lags and

expenditure leads, the government simultaneously made

amendments to the Appropriation Act by raising the

borrowing limit on two occasions. In May 2000, the

government raised the approved borrowing limit of Rs.169

billion by Rs.20 billion to Rs.189 billion. In August 2000,

the borrowing limit was again raised by Rs.25 billion to

Rs. 214 billion. The Treasury bill limit was also raised by

Rs.lO billion to Rs.135 billion.

In order to improve the delivery of basic amenities at

the local level, the government provided increased

contributions on concessionary terms to the Local Loans

and Development Fund (LLDF). Moreover, a higher

allocation of Rs.2.7 million was provided for the

decentralised budgets of Members of Parliament in order to

undertake development activities at the electoral level.

Expenditure rationalisation measures undertaken in

2000 included a compulsory 5 per cent savings from

recurrent expenditure by all spending units of the

government, public corporations, banks and statutory

agencies as envisaged in the Budget 2000. A 5 per cent

1 3 3

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

freeze from the recurrent vote of each spending agency was

made by the Treasury, allowing spending agencies to make

suitable adjustments to their budgets. Moreover, FR 66

transfers, which permit the transfer of unutilised funds

within programmes and projects through the virement

procedure, were also stopped with a view to improving

financial discipline. Moreover, the Budget 2000 also

introduced a system of registered suppliers for the

procurement of high value goods by the government with

a best price commitment. In order to improve the financial

performance of public enterprises and statutory agencies,

expenditure evaluation units in the form of audit and

management committees were set up with a view to

generating savings in the budget. The Budget 2000 also

appointed a new Salaries Commission to re-examine the

public service salary structure.

The progress made towards expenditure rationalisation

was thwarted to some extent in 2000 with the increase in

the number of ministries and the appointment of a larger

Cabinet. In spite of pressures on budgetary finances, the

government increased the number of ministries from 32 in

1999 to 46 in October, 2000. Thus, the number of Cabinet

portfolios rose to 44 from 32 in the previous year, while

the number of deputy ministers increased to 35 during the

year. This will continue to impose an additional burden on

the budget in the future, which has to be accommodated

through budget cuts elsewhere. Hence, as ongoing public

sector rationalisation schemes have targeted an overall

reduction in the public sector through measures such as

freeze on employment and cadre positions, an increase in

the number of ministries can be viewed as a step taken

backwards in the area of public sector rationalisation.

Revisions in administrative prices made in 2000

imposed an additional burden on consumers and therefore

brought about another wave of fiscal policy measures aimed

at providing relief to targeted sectors of the population.

Thus, the Samurdhi allowance for beneficiaries in receipt

of an income of Rs.250 or less per month was increased

by Rs.150 for 1,104,924 families. For families in receipt

of an income less than Rs.500 per month, the allowance

was raised by Rs.200. The number of families entitled to

this benefit was 897,863. Pensioners were also granted an

allowance of 10 per cent of the monthly pension subject

to a minimum of Rs.500 per month with effect from

October 2000. The 10 per cent allowance granted in

October 2000 incorporated a sum of Rs.300 earlier granted

to pensioners with effect from August 2000. The Budget

2000 increased the allowance for pensioners by Rs.400 per

month with effect from January 2000 for pensioners

drawing a pension of less than Rs.4,000 per month. Public

sector employees whose salaries are not adjusted for

changes in the cost of living index were accorded an

interim allowance on two occasions. In August 2000, public

sector employees drawing salaries of less than Rs. 12,000

per month were given an interim allowance of Rs.600 per

month. In October 2000 the government granted an

additional non-pensionable allowance of 10 per cent of the

salary inclusive of allowance granted in August to all public

officers subject to a minimum of Rs. 1,000 per month. The

subsidy on fertiliser was increased in June 2000 by Rs.50

per bag from Rs.398.23 to Rs.448.23 per 50 kg bag in

order to maintain the price of urea at the prevailing rate

of Rs.350 per 50 kg bag. With the increase in the price of

gas, a policy decision was also taken to subsidise low

income families in the usage of gas. Accordingly, a cash

voucher of Rs.100 was given every two months for a

family with a monthly income of less than Rs.5,000 and

utilising gas for domestic cooking purposes. Meanwhile, a

generalised subsidy in the form of a reduction in the price

of wheat flour from Rs. 17.95 per kg to Rs. 14.95 per kg was

also given in July 2000 in order to reduce the burden on

consumers. However, budgetary pressures necessitated an

increase in the flour price in November 2000 by Rs.2 per

kg to Rs. 16.95 per kg. The grant of subsidies to various

sectors of the population resulted in increasing current

expenditures of the budget, contributing to the derailment

of the fiscal consolidation process.

The government continued its strategy of making the

debt structure more market oriented and medium term. The

borrowing requirement for the year was met largely through

medium-term market oriented Treasury bonds. Treasury

bonds accounted for 85 per cent of total domestic financing

for the year. Although this constituted a desirable step in

the direction of market orientation, the actual outcome of

this policy measure had far reaching ramifications on the

interest rate structure of the economy. In the context of

unstable expectations and slippages in fiscal policy, the

overreliance on market determined Treasury bonds for

financing the budget deficit contributed to the sharp rise in

interest rates. Treasury bond yield rates on two year

maturities increased from 12 per cent in the first half of

2000 to 22 per cent in the second half of 2000. In order

to avoid such happenings in the future, careful consideration

must be given to the mix of debt instruments that is utilised

to fill the borrowing requirement.

Treasury bonds with a call option were issued for the

first time in 2000. The addition of this instrument to the

present debt portfolio of the government enabled the

government to improve the flexibility of its debt

management as it provides an option to benefit from a

decline in interest rates in the future. The date for

exercising the call option was one year after the date of

issue.

The Public Debt Department, an agency of the government, continued its efforts to develop the debt market during the year. With a view to strengthening the primary

1 3 4

Parti Central Bank o1 Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

dealer network, 8 public limited liability companies with a

dedicated capital of Rs.150 million each were appointed in

March 2000 to act as Primary Dealers (PDs). Primary

dealers are entrusted with the responsibility of being market

makers in government securities. The formation of separate

legal entities to act as PDs is expected to develop the debt

securities market and thereby facilitate debt management.

It is also expected to strengthen monetary and fiscal

management, facilitate dealer surveillance, improve the

targeting of incentives for primary dealer activities and

provide a level playing field for primary dealer activities.

The PDs are required to exclusively trade in government

securities. Legislation during the year also provided for the

Central Bank to engage in the supervision and examination

of the activities of PDs in order to ensure that these

institutions operate in a sound and efficient manner. The

infrastructure necessary for a PD surveillance system also

came into being during 2000. A framework and a system

for PD surveillance was designed, including the preparation

of two operations manuals for on-site examination and off-

site surveillance. The manual also provides guidance to PDs

as regards international best practices for trading in

government securities, overall PD management, organisation

and operations. In a bid to further strengthen the

surveillance system, the Central Bank proposes to introduce

directions relating to various aspects of surveillance

including capital adequacy, compliance reporting, audited

financial statements, prescribed accounts formats, code of

conduct and custodial arrangements in 2001.

With a view to strengthening the economy further by

addressing issues arising at the sectoral level, the

government in 2000 set up committees consisting of public

officials and private sector individuals to solve matters

specifically related to various issues or sectors in the

economy. Thus, core groups on labour, telecomunication,

apparel, taxation and capital market development were

established with public/private sector partnership with the

objective of initiating and speeding up reforms in these

sectors.

In the context of ongoing tax reforms, the activities of

the core group on taxation were directed towards exploring

new areas for revenue generation while further rationalising

the tax structure with a view to simplifying and enhancing

the transparency of the present tax system. The core group

engaged in a review of the current tax policy which entailed

at the micro level, an examination of specific taxes with a

view to improving their effectiveness, and at the macro

level, the identification of issues such as elasticity and tax

incidence in the present tax system. The terms of reference

of the taxation core group also included examining the role

of taxation with a view to encouraging foreign investment,

capital market and financial sector development.

8.2 Budget Outturn

Fiscal operations for the year 2000 commenced under a

vote on account system whereby budgetary operations for

the period January-April 2000 were conducted within this

framework. The presentation of the budget 2000 took place

in February, 2000. The budget envisaged to contain the

overall deficit at 7.6 per cent of GDP. With a revenue/GDP

ratio of 18.6 per cent and a current expenditure/GDP target

of 18.1 percent, the current account of the budget was

expected to yield a surplus of 0.6 per cent of GDP in 2000.

Public investment was envisaged at 8.1 per cent of GDP.

Financing from foreign sources was anticipated at 1.8

percent of GDP while domestic borrowings were expected

to reach 3.5 percent of GDP. Proceeds from privatisation

were targeted at 2.4 percent of GDP.

The overall deficit of the budget rose by Rs.41,286

million to reach Rs. 124,541 million in the year 2000. As

a percentage of GDP, the budget deficit increased from 7.5

per cent in 1999 to 9.9 per cent in 2000. The primary

deficit of the government, which measures the effects of

current budgetary policy by excluding interest payments,

amounted to Rs.53,341 million as compared to Rs 21,132

million in the previous year. The primary deficit as a

percentage of GDP registered 4.2 per cent in the year 2000

as compared to 1.9 per cent in the previous year. The

higher deficit was the combined outcome of a shortfall in

revenue mobilisation and increased outlays largely on

account of current expenses.

Chart 8.1 Fiscal Indicators

1997 1998 1999 —Current Account Balance - - Primary Balance —Overall Balance (before grants)

Current expenditure as a ratio of GDP reached 20.3 per

cent in 2000. The increase in current expenditure was

largely due to the escalation of defence activities in May,

2000. The heightened military activities in the north and

east of the country during the early part of 2000

necessitated the passage of a supplementary vote amounting

to Rs.28 billion in aid of defence expenditure mainly for

the purchase of military hardware and equipments. The

to Rs.70,773 million in 2000 as against a provision of

Rs.48,866 million approved in the Budget 2000. Defence

expenditure as a percentage of GDP increased from 3.9 per

cent in the Budget 2000 to 5.6 per cent in actual terms.

Meanwhile, revisions made to administrative prices as a

result of exchange rate changes and high oil prices in the

international market necessitated the government to grant

wage and pension increases while protecting targeted

segments of the population through enhanced welfare

payments. Thus, wage increases given to public sector

1 3 6

Parti

employees, the higher pension allowances granted to

pensioners, the increased fertiliser subsidy and enhanced

payments given to Samurdhi beneficiaries contributed to the

rise in current expenditure of the government. Higher

borrowings necessitated by the increase in expenditure have

enhanced interest payments in the budget resulting in a

further rise in current expenditure.

Although revenue at Rs.211,282 million registered an

increase of 8 per cent in absolute terms over the previous

year, the revenue/GDP ratio declined to 16.8 per cent in

2G00 from 17.7 per cent in 1999. The revenue mobilisation

effort fell short of the envisaged target of Rs.233,974

million in the Budget 2000. The shortfall in the revenue

collection arose from tax as well as non-tax sources. Tax

revenue as a percentage of GDP declined to 14.5 per cent

in 2000 from a level of 15 per cent in 1999. Tax revenue

shortfalls were registered in corporate income taxes and

import duty collections with both these sources of revenue

declining in absolute as well as in GDP terms during the

year 2000.

Non-tax revenue also witnessed a decline in terms of

its GDP ratio registering 2.3 per cent in 2000 from a level

of 2.7 per cent in the previous year. Revenue from non­

tax sources displayed a poor performance during the year

under review largely due to lower profits and dividends

obtained from public enterprises.

The combined outcome of lower revenue mobilisation

and higher recurrent expenditure exacerbated the current

account deficit of the budget to Rs.42,997 million in 2000

reflecting a more than threefold increase over the deficit of

Rs. 11,366 million registered in the previous year. As a

percentage of GDP, the current account deficit rose to 3.4

per cent in 2000 from 1 per cent in 1999.

Public investment at Rs.80,955 million in 2000 registered a 13 per cent increase over the previous year. As a ratio of GDP, public investment was maintained at 6.4 per cent. Main areas for public investment outlays included transport, communication, energy and water supply.

Financing from foreign grants and loans during the

year amounted to Rs.5,640 million registering a decrease of

32 per cent over 1999. Foreign loans and grants together

accounted for 0.4 per cent of GDP in financing the deficit

as compared to 0.7 per cent of GDP in 1999. The share

of foreign financing of the deficit declined to 4.5 per cent

in 2000 from a level of 9.9 per cent in the previous year.

Privatisation proceeds utilised for financing the deficit

in 2000 amounted to Rs.401 million as against a budgeted

quantum of Rs.30,000 million envisaged mainly from the

international listing of Sri Lanka Telecom in the year 2000.

The shortfall in privatisation proceeds arose from the non-

sale of Sri Lanka Telecom shares due to low prices

prevailing for the telecom sector in the international market.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

The shortfall in privatisation and foreign financing

proceeds, together with lower revenue mobilisation and

overruns in expenditure, necessitated the government to

resort to enhanced borrowings from the domestic sector.

Domestic financing of the deficit increased from 6.8 per

cent of GDP in 1999 to 9.4 per cent of GDP in 2000. The

budgeted amount for the year 2000 was 3.5 per cent of

GDP. In rupee terms, the quantum of net domestic

borrowings increased by Rs.43,624 million to reach

Rs. 118,500 million in 2000. While borrowings from non-

bank sources increased from 4.4 per cent of GDP in 1999

to 5.2 per cent of GDP in 2000, the brunt of deficit

financing was met through bank borrowings which

increased to 4.3 percent of GDP in 2000 from 2.4 per cent

of GDP in the previous year. In absolute terms, borrowings

from the banking system rose by Rs.27,393 million to reach

Rs.53,389 million in 2000. A large share of bank financing

was obtained through the Central Bank. The Central Bank

provided a sum of Rs.44,840 million for financing the

deficit while commercial banks contributed Rs. 8,549 million

towards this purpose. In GDP terms, Central Bank financing

of the deficit rose from 1.9 per cent in 1999 to 3.6 per cent

in 2000 while the share of Central Bank financing in

domestic financing rose from 28 per cent to 38 per cent

between the years. Active trading in the reverse repo market

as a result of the liquidity shortage led to the sharp increase

in Central Bank financing facilities to the government in

2000.

8.3 Revenue

The revenue mobilisation effort of the government registered a setback in 2000, with the revenue/GDP ratio declining during the year. Total revenue, as a percentage of GDP, decreased to 16.8 per cent in 2000 from 17.7 per cent in 1999 - the lowest level reached during the last decade. The decline in import duty collection and the lower revenue collection from several key public enterprises largely accounted for the decline in the total revenue collection. However, the revenue collection in nominal terms, amounting to Rs.211,282 million, rose by Rs. 15,377 million registering a slower growth of 8 percent in 2000, as compared to a growth rate of 12 percent observed in the previous year.

In spite of the introduction of several revenue

mobilisation measures in the Budget 2000 and during the

year, tax revenue as a percentage of GDP, declined to 14.5

per cent in 2000, from 15.0 per cent in 1999. An expansion

in the base and rate of the National Security Levy (NSL),

upward revisions made to excise duty rates on cigarettes

and liquor and the extension of the coverage of the Goods

and Services Tax (GST) to include the supply and import

of revenue generating items were some measures taken to

enhance the revenue collection during 2000.

1 3 7

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

Despite the revenue shortfall, the government continued

its agenda of rationalising the tax structure. Accordingly,

adjustments were made in 2000, to the tariff structure in

order to reduce the highest level of nominal protection from

30 per cent to 25 per cent (except for a few selected

agricultural products), while the number of rate bands was

also brought down from three to two. The year 2000, also

witnessed the rationalisation of the extensive range of

incentives given to the BOI sector.

Meanwhile, nontax revenue, which has been stable at

around 2.7 per cent of GDP for the last two consecutive

years, dropped to 2.3 per cent of GDP in 2000. Reduced

payments in the form of profits and dividends from public

enterprises can largely account for the lower nontax revenue

collection.

The poor revenue performance resulted in a deviation

from the revenue targets envisaged in the Budget 2000.

Total revenue, targeted at 18.7 per cent of GDP in the

Budget 2000, fell short of the target by 1.9 percentage

points. Tax revenue, targeted at 16.1 per cent of GDP, was

below the target by 1.6 percentage points, while non-tax

revenue, envisaged at 2.6 per cent of GDP, fell short of

the budgetary target by 0.3 percentage points.

Tax Revenue

Tax revenue, totalling Rs. 182,392 million, registered a

slower growth of 10 per cent in 2000, as compared to an

increase of 13 per cent observed in the previous year.

Reflecting the continuing structural shift towards domestic

taxes from international trade oriented taxes, taxes on

domestic goods and services amounting to Rs.71,295

million increased their importance in the tax structure.

Revenue from domestic goods and services as a percentage

of total tax revenue rose from 36 percent in 1999 to 39

percent in 2000. Consequently, the share of international

trade oriented taxes as a percentage of total tax revenue

declined to 41 percent in 2000, from 43 per cent in 1999.

The downward revision of the tariff structure, the high

value of duty free imports and the granting of temporary

duty waivers for some essential imports, largely contributed

to this structural change.

Revenue from income taxes declined by 3 per cent to

Rs.27,457 million in 2000. As a percentage of GDP, the

income tax collection decreased from 2.6 per cent in 1999

to 2.2 per cent in 2000 while its share in total taxes

dropped from 17 per cent to 15 per cent in 2000. The

decline in the income tax collection was mainly due to the

poor performance of corporate taxes. Revenue from

corporate taxes recorded a negative growth of 14 per cent

in 2000 in contrast to a very high growth of 56 per cent

in 1999, mainly due to lower profits or losses in some

major public corporations. Personal income taxes however,

showed a significant growth of 18 per cent in 2000 as

compared to an increase of 13 per cent in the previous year

reflecting the high income growth and widening of the

coverage of the withholding tax base.

The revenue collection from corporate taxes declined

by Rs.2,605 million to Rs. 15,757 million in 2000. The

share of corporate taxes in the total income tax collection

dropped to 57 per cent in 2000, from 65 per cent in 1999.

Lower tax payments by two key public enterprises namely,

the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and the Sri Lanka

Ports Authority (SLPA), were the main reasons for the

decline in corporate taxes. In 1999, the SLPA and the CPC

were the two largest corporate tax payers with payments of

Rs.3.4 billion each, together accounting for 37 per cent of

the total corporate tax collection. However, due to cash

flow problems, the SLPA was only able to meet a partial

payment of Rs.1.5 billion as income tax liability for 2000,

contributing to the shortfall in the corporate tax collection.

The CPC, on the other hand, did not incur any tax liability

as the corporation incurred large losses during the year due

to the sharp increase in international fuel prices which was

not accompanied by timely and adequate compensatory

increases in the domestic price of petroleum products.

Corporate tax revenue from other institutions however,

recorded an increase of 24 per cent in 2000. Sectors that

performed particularly well during the year were the

banking and finance sector, followed by tobacco and

wholesale and retail trade.

The revenue collection from personal income taxes

totalled Rs.10,820 million recording an increase of 18 per

cent in 2000. Higher salaries of both the public and private

sectors together with the widening of the coverage of the

withholding tax to all services were the main factors

responsible for this growth. The withholding tax, which had

hitherto applied only to payments made for professional

services, was extended to cover all services, including

payments made to corporate bodies and other businesses.

The increase in private savings, attracted by high positive

real interest rates in 2000, also contributed to the enhanced

collection on account of income taxes through higher tax

payments on interest income during the year. Meanwhile,

revenue from Save the Nation Contribution (SNC) rose by

26 per cent, from Rs. 697 million in 1999 to Rs.880 million

in 2000. This was a direct result of increased salaries and

improved tax administration by the Inland Revenue

Department.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) generated a sum

of Rs.43,893 million in 2000 reflecting a growth of 23 per

cent in revenue collection over the previous year. Revenue

from GST accounted for nearly a quarter of the total tax

revenue in 2000. As a ratio of GDP, GST increased its

share from 3.2 per cent in 1999 to 3.5 per cent in 2000.

Improved tax administration, widening of the tax base,

streamlining of the tax refund system and better economic

performance were contributory factors for the enhanced

GST tax collection.

GST revenue from domestically produced goods and

services amounted to Rs.25,021 million recording a growth

of over 27 per cent. The growth in the liquor and tobacco

industries, together with the expansion in the coverage of

GST to encompass revenue generating items such as

cement, meat, timber and gas, contributed to the higher

GST collection from the manufacturing sector. The tobacco

industry was the single largest contributor to GST in the

manufacturing sector, accounting for 19 per cent of the

GST collection from the manufacturing sector and 5 per

cent of total GST revenue. The liquor industry was the next

largest contributor followed by petroleum. The higher

growth in services such as telecommunications, electricity,

insurance and construction and the expiry of the GST

exemption given to the hotel industry in April 2000, were

the main reasons for the growth in GST revenue from the

non manufacturing sector. Considerable improvements in

GST administration and taxpayer compliance during the

year, particularly through the conduct of investigations and

audits, also contributed to the higher GST revenue

collection in 2000.

GST from imports amounting to Rs.18,871 million

recorded a growth of 19 per cent in 2000. This was the

combined outcome of a growth of over 20 per cent in

imports in 2000, expansion of the GST tax base and

improvements made to the tax refund system. GST refunds

on imports reduced from Rs.9,137 million in 1999 to

Rs.7,121 million in 2000. The reduction in refunds was due

to two amendments made to the GST refund system. In the

latter half of 1999, the cash payment of input credit refunds

to the importer on imported inputs used in the production

of exports was replaced with a credit voucher system. In

2000, the cash refund in respect of input credit given to

producers supplying to the domestic market was restricted

to any excess tax paid on input of local purchases, while

the input credit facility for importers, who undertake

wholesale and retail trade was completely removed.

Revenue mobilised from excise taxes, which was Rs.42,655 million, accounted for 23 per cent of the total tax revenue collection in the period under review. As in the previous year, revenue from excise taxes grew at 19 per cent in 2000. Excise taxes as a percentage of GDP, increased from 3.2 per cent to 3.4 per cent in 2000. The enhanced revenue collection from petroleum products, as a result of the changes made to the taxation of petroleum products and the upward revisions in the excise duty rates on cigarettes largely contributed to the growth in excise duty collection.

Revenue generated from the excise duty on petroleum

products amounted to Rs. 10,700 million, recording a sharp

increase of 57 per cent in 2000. Accordingly, its share in

total excise duty collection also rose to 25 per cent from

20 per cent in the previous year. This improvement reflects

both a change in the tax collection system of petroleum

products and the sharp increase in diesel sales by 22 per

cent in 2000. The removal of import duties on crude oil

in the Budget 2000, resulted in the revision of excise duties

on petrol and diesel and the imposition of an excise duty

on kerosene, in order to maintain revenue neutrality. Excise

duties on petrol, diesel and kerosene were set at 45 per

cent. However, the sharp increase in international fuel prices

in 2000, which led to heavy losses being incurred by the

CPC, led to the revision of excise tax rates on petroleum

products from 45 per cent to 35 per cent in October, 2000.

Revenue from the excise duty on motor vehicles remained

C o m p o s i t i o n o f R e v e n u e

1996

1 4 0

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

almost unchanged in 2000, as the revenue impact of an

increase in the excise duty on petrol vehicles from 10 to

15 per cent and diesel vehicles from 60 to 65 per cent in

February 2000, was offset by the reduction in the imports

of motor vehicles by 11 per cent in 2000.

Revenue from the excise duties on cigarettes amounted

to Rs. 19,268 million, accounting for 45 per cent of total

excise tax collection in 2000. Despite the reduction in total

sales of cigarettes by 2 per cent, excise taxes on cigarettes

grew by 12 per cent in 2000, due to the increase in taxes

on cigarettes by around 20 per cent and the shift in

consumption to brands with higher taxes.

Despite an increase in the excise duty rate on hard

liquor by Rs.12 per proof litre in May 2000, excise duties

on liquor grew at a lower rate of 9 per cent in 2000

compared to 14 per cent in 1999, due to a decline in the

production of higher taxed brands of hard liquor in 2000.

The revenue collection from malt liquor rose by 3.5 per

cent, entirely due to a shift in the production towards higher

strength malt liquor which are subject to a higher tax rate.

The National Security Levy was a buoyant source of

revenue in 2000, with its GDP share increasing from 2.5

per cent to 2.7 per cent in 2000. Total revenue mobilised

from the NSL amounted to Rs.33,539 million in 2000,

recording an increase of 19 per cent and accounting for 18

per cent of total tax collection.. The increase in revenue

from the NSL was due to the expansion of its coverage to

a wider spectrum of services, growth in some key sectors

liable for the NSL, such as finance and telecommunications

and the upward revision in the tax rate in May 2000, from

5.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent. The NSL on domestic activities

continued to show high growth, increasing by 38 per cent

in 2000. The major contributor to NSL revenue from

domestic activities was the banking sector, which accounted

for more than a third of the total NSL revenue collection

from domestic sources. However, a slowdown in the growth

of revenue from the NSL on imports from 31 per cent to

8 per cent in 2000, reflected the higher share of imports

that are not liable to NSL such as defence, intermediate

goods and crude oil imports.

Despite a growth in imports by over 20 per cent in

2000, revenue from import duties declined by 14 per cent

to Rs. 23,970 million. Consequently, its contribution to total

tax revenue also dropped to 13 per cent in 2000 from 17

per cent in 1999. This decline was due to the removal of

duty on crude oil imports, the temporary duty waiver

afforded to refined petroleum imports, the partial duty

waiver on essential food items and the rationalisation of the

tariff structure. The Budget 2000 reduced the three-band

tariff structure (10, 20 and 35) to two bands (10 and 25)

with a special duty rate (protective tariff) of 35 per cent

provided for selected agricultural commodities. The duty

rate for raw material imports was maintained at 5 per cent.

The average duty rate, the ratio of import duties to the total

value of imports, declined from 7 per cent in 1999 to 4.5

per cent in 2000. Lower import tariffs and the higher value

of duty free imports such as raw materials for export

oriented industries, defence purchases ,and crude oil imports

in 2000, can account for the lower average import duty

incidence. The effective duty rate declined from 21 per cent

in 1999 to 15 per cent in 2000. Duty waivers granted

during the year, especially the duty waiver given to CPC

and the partial duty waiver on certain essential commodities

such as sugar, together with the lower tariff structure,

contributed to the sharp decline in the effective duty rate.

Revenue collection from stamp duties which was

Rs.8,163 million grew at a slower pace of 6 per cent in

2000, compared to the 9 per cent growth recorded in 1999.

The reduction in the stamp duty on mortgage backed

securities, in order to reduce the cost of borrowing and

promote the mortgage market, effected in the Budget 2000,

was a major reason for this slow down. To prevent abuses

in the system, the Budget 2000 transferred the collection

of revenue from stamp duties on trade documents from

banks to the customs with effect from April 2000. As a

result the base on which stamp duty was imposed was

changed from the value of the Letter of Credit (LC) to the

invoice value. The change in the collection point from bank

to the customs is expected to prevent revenue leakages

arising from under invoicing problems. Consequently, the

revenue collection from stamp duties on trade documents

rose from Rs.3,884 million in 1999 to Rs.5,697 million in

2000, increasing its share in the total stamp duty collection

from 51 per cent to 70 per cent in 2000.

Non Tax Revenue

Non tax revenue declined by 3 per cent to Rs.28,890 million in 2000. As a percentage of GDP, non-tax revenue, which had remained stable at around 2.7 per cent in 1998 and 1999, fell to 2.3 per cent in 2000. Lower profit and dividend transfers from public enterprises mainly contributed to this decrease. Although the budget envisaged profit and dividend transfers of Rs.8.8 billion in 2000, only Rs.6.3 billion was realised. As compared to 1999, revenue from profits and dividends (excluding Central Bank profit transfers) declined by 18 per cent in 2000. Losses incurred by the CPC in 2000, and the lower taxable profits of SLT due to large investment allowances and depreciation allowances claimed in 2000, the reduction in international settlements on incoming calls from abroad, as well as the exchange losses suffered on foreign loan repayments due to the sharp depreciation of the rupee during the year, were the major contributory factors for this decline. Central Bank profit transfers increased by Rs.200 million to Rs.3,200 million in 2000. Interest income collected on loans given to public enterprises grew by 4 per cent in 2000 compared to 3 per cent in 1999. The main sources of interest income

1 4 1

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

were the CEB (Rs.2,345 million), SLT (Rs. 1,918 million)

and SLPA (Rs.988 million). Fees and charges grew by 6

per cent in 2000 reflecting higher passport fees introduced

in the Budget 2000.

8.4 Expenditure

In order to maintain the fiscal deficit within the targeted

level, the Budget 2000 expected to contain current

expenditure at 18.1 per cent of GDP, while maintaining

capital expenditure and net lending at 8.2 per cent of GDP.

However, there was a substantial deviation from this

expected fiscal consolidation path due to unforeseen

expenditure on defence activities, higher outlays on salaries

and welfare payments and enhanced interest cost in 2000.

Total current expenditure exceeded its original target by 2.1

percentage points of GDP, while public investments

remained 1.7 percentage points below the anticipated target.

In comparison to 1999, current expenditure increased by 1.6

percentage points of GDP to 20.3 per cent of GDP in 2000,

while public investment was maintained at 6.4 per cent of

GDP. Consequent on these developments, total expenditure

as a percentage of GDP rose to 26.7 per cent from 25.2

per cent in 1999.

Total expenditure and net lending amounted to Rs.

335,822 million, a 20 per cent increase in 2000. Current

outlays rose by 23 per cent to Rs.254,279 million, while

capital expenditure and net lending reported a 13 per cent

increase to Rs.81,544 million. The escalation of defence

activities in the North and East since May 2000 compelled

the government to keep the country on a war-footing and

provide required resources to accommodate the needs of the

defence services. As a result, there was a substantial

increase in expenditure on defence imports, other local

purchases related to defence activities and payments of

salaries of newly recruited soldiers. In absolute terms, total

defence expenditure including public order and safety

increased by Rs. 22,066 million to Rs. 70,773 million in

2000. As a proportion of GDP, it rose from 4.4 per cent

to 5.6 per cent between the years. This was the highest

defence/GDP ratio recorded after 1996; excluding public

order and safety it rose by Rs.16,844 million to Rs.56,915

million i.e. as a ratio of GDP from 3.6 per cent to 4.5 per

cent. In addition, relief measures (such as increases in

salaries and welfare payments for public sector employees,

pensioners and Samurdhi beneficiaries) introduced in mid

2000 to compensate for the high cost of living in view of

the upward revision of administered prices, and high interest

cost on domestic debt due to increased borrowings from the

domestic market also contributed to the increase in current

expenditure. The resource constraints, resulting from the

high current expenditure and shortfall in revenue collection,

compelled the government to re-prioritise the public

investment programme in 2000. All nonpriority and locally

funded public investment programmes were curtailed in mid

2000 specially to accommodate rising defence expenditure,

as this was considered a national priority. Meanwhile, slow

performance of some of the foreign funded projects and a

high level of underutilisation also contributed to the low

level of public investment in comparison to the targetted

programme in 2000. In view of the national priority needs,

the curtailment of capital expenditure to meet current

expenses to a certain extent was inevitable. However, in the

long run, maintaining capital expenditure at the desired

level is essential for sustained economic development and

also for the government sector to reinforce the private

sector initiatives in capital formation.

Current Expenditure

The Budget 2000 targeted to contain current expenditure at

18.1 per cent of GDP with the objective of further

strengthening the fiscal consolidation process implemented

in the recent past. In line with this objective, the

government was able to maintain outlays within the targeted

levels during the early months in 2000. However, the

escalation of defence activities after May 2000 compelled

the government to provide additional funds to strengthen

defence services. Accordingly, five supplementaries,

amounting to Rs. 28 billion were approved for defence

services, while a further Rs.2 billion was provided for

contingency purposes. In addition, a relief package extended

to public sector employees, pensioners and Samurdhi

recipients to meet the rising cost of living due to the

adjustment of various administered prices (such as diesel,

electricity and gas) and service charges (telephone, bus fares

etc.) contributed to increasing the current expenditure by

about Rs. 6,600 million. As a result of these measures, total

current expenditure in 2000 increased by 23 per cent to Rs.

254,279 million, compared to a 4 per cent increase in 1999.

Major increases were recorded in expenditure on

defence, interest payments and the central government

salaries and other goods and services. Defence expenditure

increased by 1.2 percentage points to 5.6 per cent of GDP,

while expenditure on salaries and other expenditure of the

central government rose to 2.9 per cent of GDP from 2.5

per cent of GDP in 1999. Expenditure on interest increased

by 0.1 percentage points to 5.7 per cent of GDP.

Meanwhile, central government block grants to PCs to meet

recurrent expenses of PCs remained at 1.8 per cent of GDP.

Expenditure on subsidies and transfers was maintained at

4.2 per cent of GDP in the current year under review as

in 1999. With respect to the composition of the current

expenditure, 51 per cent was incurred on the purchase of

goods and services, while interest payments accounted for

28 per cent. The corresponding shares in 1999 were 47 per

cent and 30 per cent, respectively.

The total expenditure on salaries and wages showed an

increase of 17 per cent to Rs.68,544 million in 2000,

compared with a 9 per cent increase in 1999. Salaries and

wages as a percentage of GDP increased from 5.3 per cent

in 1999 to 5.5 per cent of GDP in 2000. The wage bill of

employees in the central government, at Rs.18,507 million,

accounted for 27 per cent of the total salary bill. The

growth in the central government employees' salary bill was

26 per cent in 2000 compared to 13 per cent in the

previous year. The salary increase (interim allowance) given

to public sector employees from August 2000 and the full

year impact of the wage bill of 10,000 graduates recruited

into the public service in 1999, mainly contributed to this

increase. In view of the rising cost of living, the

government decided to pay an interim allowance of Rs.600

per month from August 2000 to employees who draw a

monthly salary of less than Rs. 12,000. However, this

allowance was then revised upward to a minimum of

Rs. 1,000 or 10 per cent of the salary, whichever was

higher. Further, the salary increase was extended to the

entire public service. Salaries and wages paid for defence

and public order and safety services rose by 15 per cent

to Rs.28,636 million accounting for 42 per cent of the total

salary bill. The payment of the interim allowance and the

new recruitment of soldiers primarily contributed to this

increase. Meanwhile, salaries and wages of provincial

councils (PCs) increased by 13 per cent to Rs.21,401

million. The resource constraints of the central government,

limited transfer payments to PCs allowing them to meet part

of the rising salary bill through their revenue generation.

It has been estimated that the payment of the interim

allowance was responsible for 39 per cent of the increase

in the wage bill in 2000.

Government purchases of other goods and services, at

Rs.62,121 million recorded a significant increase of 57 per

cent in 2000. In contrast, these purchases in 1999 decreased

by 9 per cent. As a percentage of GDP, expenditure on

these items increased to 5.0 per cent in 2000 compared to

3.6 per cent in 1999. The main factor responsible for this

sharp increase was the substantial growth in expenditure

incurred on defence services, which increased by 77 per

cent to Rs.42,137 million, compared to a 15 per cent

decline in 1999. The purchase of defence goods and

services accounted for 68 per cent of the total outlays on

other goods and services. This ratio in 1999 was 60 per

cent. The expenditure incurred by the central government

on other goods and services also increased by 33 per cent

in 2000 compared to 13 per cent in 1999. Meanwhile, the

release of grants to PCs on accounts of other goods and

services decreased to Rs.1,819 million in 2000 from

Rs.2,112 million in 1999.

The total interest expenditure of the central government

increased by 15 per cent to Rs.71,200 million in 2000. This

increase in 1999 was 13 per cent. Total interest payments

accounted for 28 per cent of the current expenditure, while

as a percentage of GDP, it increased to 5.7 per cent

compared with 5.6 per cent in the previous year. High

budget deficits and increased borrowings, especially from

domestic sources at market interest rates, were responsible

for the high interest cost in the Budget. In order to avert

the adverse implications of escalating interest costs on the

government budget, corrective measures should be adopted

through a rational debt management strategy, while making

every effort to contain the fiscal deficit at a sustainable

level.

Total interest payments consisted of Rs.62,185 million interest paid on domestic debt and Rs.9,015 million interest paid on foreign debt. Domestic interest payments include

1 4 3

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

interest payments of Rs.6,068 million to the two state banks

and the NSB on long-term special Rupee securities issued

in 1993 and 1996. The interest cost on domestic debt, net

of interest paid to the two state banks, increased by 19 per

cent to Rs. 56,117 million. In 2000, the interest cost on

domestic debt increased to 5.0 per cent of GDP from 4.8

per cent in 1999. This was entirely due to the heavy

borrowings from the domestic market in financing the

budget deficit. Meanwhile, interest paid on foreign loans

increased by 3 per cent, largely due to exchange rate

variations.

Interest payments on account of Rupee securities, at Rs

33,902 million, recorded an increase of Rs 1,100 million

mainly due to the increase of Rupee loans stock by Rs

11,486 million in 1999. Although Rupee securities

accounted for 55 per cent of the interest cost in 2000, its

relative share in total domestic interest payments has

declined from 61 in 1999 to 55 per cent in 2000. This was

due to the greater use of Treasury bonds for government

borrowing and a decline in the average interest rate on

Rupee securities. The average interest rate on Rupee

securities (total interest payment as a ratio of outstanding

Rupee loan stock at the end of 1999) declined to 12.9 per

cent in 2000 from 13.1 per cent in 1999 and 13.8 per cent

in 1998. The shift in the Rupee loan stock from higher

interest bearing Rupee loans to lower interest bearing ones

and the exercising of an early retirement option to retire

high cost Rupee securities in the recent past were the main

factors that contributed to the decline in the average interest

rate.

In spite of the increase in the outstanding Treasury bill

stock by Rs.10 billion in 2000, interest payments on

Treasury bills declined by Rs.319 million to Rs. 12,766

million in 2000. Accordingly, interest payments as a ratio

of the year end Treasury bill stock dropped to 9.5 per cent

in 2000 from 10.5 per cent in 1999. This was the reflection

of the relatively low interest rates prevailing during 1999

and the first half of 2000 and the shift of Treasury bill

issues from shorter maturity bills (3 months) to longer

maturity bills (over 6 months) for which interest is to be

paid in 2001.

The interest payment on account of Treasury bonds

recorded a sharp increase from Rs.7,487 million to

Rs. 15,015 million in 2000. Its share in the total interest

payments increased from 14 per cent to 24 per cent in

2000. This was entirely due to the substantial amount of

funds mobilised through Treasury bonds in 1999 (Rs.55,952

million) and in 2000 (Rs.99,257 million). The outstanding

Treasury bond stock increased to Rs.204,124 million at end

2000 from Rs.104,867 million in 1999 and Rs.48,915

million in 1998. However, the reduction of coupon rates on

Treasury bonds to a range of 10.75-11.75 per cent for

maturities of 2-6 years bonds from 11.00-12.00 per cent in

1999 helped partly to contain the rising interest cost in

2000. The impact of the sharp increase in the interest rates

on Treasury bonds since the beginning of the last quarter

of 2000, was not directly reflected in the interest cost in

2000 as the coupon rate on Treasury bonds were fixed

throughout the year. However, due to the increased gap

between the fixed coupon rates and the increased yields on

bonds, there was a cash shortfall of Rs.9,339 million in the

bond programme in 2000 as bonds were sold at a discount.

This will be reflected as interest costs at the time of the

maturity of these bonds.

Interest payments on foreign debt recorded a moderate

growth of 3 per cent to Rs.9,015 million in 2000. The

reduction of borrowings from the external sector on a net

basis, a slower rate of depreciation of the Central Bank

middle exchange rate, at which debt service payments were

made and a lower rate of depreciation of the rupee against

the Japanese yen could be cited as some of the main

reasons for the slow growth of interest cost on foreign debt

in 2000. As a percentage of GDP, interest cost on foreign

debt remained at 0.7 per cent, the same ratio observed in

1999.

Current transfers and subsidies increased by 11 per

cent to Rs.52,314 million compared to a marginal decline

in 1999. As a percentage of GDP, this expenditure was

maintained at 4.2 per cent as in 1999. Expenditure on

pension payments increased by 13 per cent to Rs.21,602

million in 2000. Pension expenditure accounted for 52 per

cent of total transfers to the household sector, while as a

percentage of GDP, it remained at 1.7 per cent. In addition

to the increase in the number of pensioners by about 8,000,

the increase in pension payments from August 2000

contributed to enhancing the pension bill. In view of the

impact of the upward revision of the administered prices

of certain goods and services on the living standard of

pensioners, monthly pension payments were increased by

Rs.300 per month for pensioners who receive a pension of

less than Rs.6,000 per month from August 2000. This was

again revised upward by Rs.200 from October 2000 and the

increase granted to all pensioners. The additional cost

incurred as a result of this pension revision was estimated

at Rs.750 million and accounted for 29 per cent of the

increase in the pension bill in 2000.

The increase in the number of families entitled to the

income supplementary programme of Samurdhi and upward

revision of the value of Samurdhi benefits during the

second half of 2000 increased the total cost of the Samurdhi

programme by 20 per cent to Rs.9,661 million in 2000. The

total number of families entitled to Samurdhi benefits

increased by 26,032 to 2,013,685 at the end of 2000.

Meanwhile, Samurdhi benefits, which have not been

changed since the introduction of the programme, were

revised upward in August 2000 to off-set the adverse

impact of the rising cost of living on the most vulnerable

groups. A continuous increase in the number of families

entitled to Samurdhi benefits indicates the urgent need for

introducing a proper screening process to minimise the

leakage of public funds.

Expenditure incurred on the fertiliser subsidy increased

to Rs. 1,733 million compared to Rs.1,390 million in 1999.

This was due to the decision taken by the government to

maintain the price of urea at Rs. 350 per 50 kg despite the

increase in international prices to US$ 137 per metric ton

in 2000 compared to US$ 110 per metric ton in 1999.

The other welfare transfers to households including

school uniforms, text books and season tickets, payments

made to disabled soldiers and the cost of the dry ration

programme for refugees, amounted to Rs.8,517 million in

2000 in comparison to Rs.7,875 million in 1999.

Current transfers to public corporations, institutions

and other levels of government increased by 4 per cent to

Rs. 10,499 million in 2000. As a ratio of GDP, it further

dropped to 0.8 per cent from 0.9 per cent in 1999.

Transfers to public corporations amounted to Rs.3,370

million, an increase of 3 per cent, while public institutions

obtained a sum of Rs.5,705 million, an increase of 18 per

cent over 1999. Current transfers to institutions, include

mainly transfers to the Mahaweli Authority (Rs.816

million), the Samurdhi Authority (Rs. 1,333 million) Sri

Jayawardenapura Hospital (Rs.350 million) and Road

Development Authority (Rs.251 million).

Transfers to cover the operational losses of Sri Lanka Railways and the Postal Department amounted to Rs. 1,529 million and Rs.188 million, respectively for the year 2000. The corresponding transfers in 1999 were Rs. 1,848 million and Rs.212 million, respectively. Curtailment of current expenditure while improving the revenue collection were mainly responsible for the decrease in operational losses of these two public enterprises. The substantial level of operational losses at Sri Lanka Railway indicates the necessity of an upward adjustment of railway fares and structural reforms to maintain the viability of the enterprise. Meanwhile, current transfers to other levels of government declined to Rs. 1,424 million in 2000 from Rs.1,629 million in 1999 due to resource constraints of the central government.

Public Investment

Total expenditure on public investment increased in absolute terms by 13 per cent to Rs.80,955 million. However, as a percentage of GDP, it was maintained at 6.4 per cent. Although the Budget for 2000 had targeted public investment at 8.1 per cent of GDP (Rs.102,261 million), two main factors, namely, curtailment of non-priority capital expenditure to finance increasing defence expenditure, and a slow progress in foreign funded investment projects

constrained the government from achieving the target.

Expenditure cuts imposed in May, 2000 were expected to

reduce the level of public investment by Rs.7,500 million

or 0.6 per cent of GDP. As against a sum of Rs.43,800

million anticipated under the external funding programme

for public investment, realised investment was only

Rs.28,922 million. The resource shortfall (about Rs.15

billion) resulted in a reduction of the expected level of

public investment by 1.2 percentage points of GDP. These

events are a matter for concern, as maintenance of public

investment at a reasonable level is necessary to create an

environment conducive to boosting private investment and

to ensuring the growth momentum of the economy along

the desired long term path.

Expenditure incurred by ministries and departments of the central government for purchase of capital assets and construction and development of fixed assets declined marginally to Rs.32,934 million. These investments were mainly focused on the improvement of education, health, agriculture and irrigation infrastructure. Total capital transfers to public corporations and institutions (Rs.26,570 million) recorded a slow growth of 6 per cent as compared to 27 per cent growth in the previous year. The slow performances were largely reported in public institutions such as National Water Supply and Drainage Board (Rs.4,695 million), Road Development Authority (Rs.7,119 million), BOI (Rs.1,470 million) and Urban Development Authority (Rs.200 million). Investment activities of Provincial Councils (PCs) reported a significant improvement in 2000. With the implementation of a new regional investment programme, called the 'Provincial Specific Development Programme (PSDP)' under the PC system, total investment expenditure by PCs increased to Rs.8,218 million in 2000 compared to Rs.2,297 million in

1999. This expenditure was mainly incurred on improving education, health and road infrastructure of the provinces.

The on-lending programme, which provides foreign

funds to commercially oriented public enterprises, was

limited to Rs. 13,187 million in 2000 compared to an

envisaged sum of Rs.21,718 million in the Budget. The

original programme was expected to receive funds from

external donors on concessionary terms. Although the three

major public enterprises, the CEB (Rs.8,684 million), SLT

(Rs.7,293 million) and SLPA (Rs.3,023 million) together

were expected to utilise 87 per cent of the original on-

lending programme, the actual utilisation rate was only 59

per cent. The SLPA was able to utilise only 22 per cent

of the planned on-lent funds in 2000 due to the delay in

completion of the North Pier Development Project Stage II

and the delay in obtaining funds under the World Bank

assisted programme. The foreign fund utilisation rate in

1999 was 23 per cent. The continuous under-utilisation of

foreign on-lent funds by the SLPA is a matter for urgent

concern as insufficient investments in port infrastructure will

directly affect the efficiency and competitiveness of the

Colombo Port. The utilisation rate of the on-lending,

programme of CEB was 69 per cent (Rs.5,963 million) in

2000. Major projects implemented under the on-lending

programme of the CEB were the Kukule Ganga hydro

power project (Rs.2,333 million), combined cycle power

project-(Rs. 1,569 million) and second power transmission

and distribution project (Rs. 1,523 million). Total on-lending

to SLT amounted to Rs.4,630 million and accounted for 63

per cent of the planned annual programme. As a large share

of these foreign resources are directed to the improvement

of utility services in the economy, special attention is

needed to remove bottlenecks in project implementation and

accelerate the utilisation of these concessionary funds.

On a functional basis, public investment in-economic,

services, at Rs.54,650 million, accounted for 68 per cent of

the total public investment in 2000. In nominal terms,

investment in economic services rose by 21 per cent and

was maintained at 4.3 per cent of GDP in 2000. In

comparison to the total budgetary provision of Rs.79,723

million, the investment in economic services was limited to

67 per cent due to curtailment of funds allocated for locally

funded projects and slow progress in foreign funded

projects. Under the economic services, investment in the

transport and communications sector showed a sharp

increase of 47 per cent to Rs.24,911 million. Sri Lanka

Railways (Rs.6,280 million), RDA (Rs.7,119 million), SLT

(Rs.4,630 million) and SLTB (Rs.2,132 million) were the

major investors accounting for 81 per cent of the investment

in this category.

Public investment in the energy and water supply

sector reported a 23 per cent increase to Rs. 13,282 million

and accounted for 24 per cent of total investment in

economic services. CEB (Rs.7,442 million) and the National

Water Supply and Drainage Board (Rs.3,475 million)

accounted for 82 per cent of the investment in this sector

in 2000. Public investment in agriculture and irrigation

(Rs.6,908 million), and the fisheries (Rs.899 million) sectors

recorded an 8 per cent increase in 2000. As in the previous

year, the Mahaweli Authority continued to be the main

recipient, receiving Rs.1,716 million, followed by the

TSHDA (Rs.219 million). In addition, direct investment in

agriculture, irrigation and fisheries by the relevant

departments amounted to Rs.5,353 million, a 5 per cent

increase over the previous year.

Public investment in social services, at Rs. 16,471

million, showed a marginal reduction compared with the

previous year. This was a combined outcome of the

increase in investment on health (Rs.5,302 million), housing

(Rs.2,061 million) and welfare services (Rs.415 million) and

a reduction of investment in education (Rs.7,135 million)

and community services (Rs. 1,558 million). Investment in

the education and health sectors was mainly for construction

and improvement of schools and hospitals and the supply

of necessary equipment for these services. Investment in the

housing sector was mainly focused on the development of

housing facilities in the urban, plantation and fisheries

sectors. Of the total investment on community services, one

third (Rs. 1,558 million) was provided to the Samurdhi

Authority to finance various, community development

programmes.

8.5 Provincial Councils

The total revenue of the Provincial Councils (PCs) grew at

a slower pace of 8 per cent to Rs.7,534 million in 2000 in

comparison to a 17 per cent growth in 1999. The total

expenditure of PCs amounted to Rs.37,328 million in 2000,

an increase of 29 per. cent compared to a 7 per cent

increase in 1999. As a percentage of GDP, revenue

remained unchanged at 0.6 per cent, while expenditure

increased from 2.6 per cent to 2.9 per cent. In 2000, the

total revenue of PCs was sufficient to cover only 20 per

cent of their resource needs compared to 24 per cent in

1999. This indicates the increasing dependency of PCs on

the central government to undertake functions devolved on

them. The resource gap of PCs was entirely met through

central government transfers of Rs.31,543 million. This

consisted of a block grant of Rs.23,220 million for recurrent

expenses and capital grants of Rs. 8,323 million for

investment programmes.

The current expenditure of PCs increased by 10 per

cent to Rs 28,856 million in 2000 due to higher salaries

and wages and other current expenses. Capital expenditure

at Rs. 8,472 million, recorded about a three fold increase

in comparison to the previous year. This increase was

mainly due to the transfer of responsibility of implementing

and funding the regional development programmes from the

central government to PCs in 2000. Prior to 2000, these

development programmes were implemented under the

Medium Term Investment Programme (MTIP) in which the

role of PCs was limited to an implementing agency, while

the funding responsibility rested with the respective line

ministries of the central government. In 2000, the Provincial

Specific Development Programme (PSDP) was introduced

in place of the MTIP and the required funds to implement

such programmes were transferred through Provincial

Specific Development Grants (PSDG) from the central

government to PCs. In addition to the PSDP, other capital

expenditure programmes, implemented under the criteria

based grants and other funding sources, also took place in

2000.

The level of capital expenditure in 2000, though

reflecting a substantial increase from last year, was well

below the estimated total capital expenditure programme of

PCs, which was in the region of Rs.ll billion. The slower

implementation of the capital expenditure programme was

attributed to the resource constraints of the central

government, project implementation delays and a slow

growth in revenue collection. The high dependence of PCs

on the central government for resources, limited authority

devolved to PCs for self-generation of resources and

inadequate capacities and skills of PCs to execute

development projects were some of the main impediments

faced by PCs in reaching their original budgetary targets.

Revenue

Total revenue collection of PCs in 2000 increased at a

slower rate of 8 per cent compared to a 17 per cent growth

in 1999. This was a result of the reduced rate of growth

of revenue in all revenue generating sources. Three major

sources of revenue, turnover tax, licence fees and stamp

duty, accounted for 86 per cent of the total revenue in

2000. Of the total revenue collection, the devolved revenue

of PCs amounted to Rs. 5,505 million compared to Rs.5,054

million in 1999. The balance revenue was collected on

behalf of Local Governments (LGs) and the central

government. The heavy concentration of revenue collection

in the Western Province continued accounting for 67 per

cent of the total revenue in 2000. This is mainly due to

the heavy concentration of business enterprises in the

Western Province.

The turnover tax on wholesale and retail businesses at Rs.3,705 million, recorded an increase of 10 per cent, compared to a 13 per cent growth in 1999. This was a reflection of the increase in the number of tax payers liable for turnover tax and the increase of turnover of business enterprises during the period. The share of turnover taxes

1 4 9

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

in total revenue remained at 50 per cent in 2000.

Approximately 74 per cent of total turnover taxes were

collected by the Western PC in 2000.

Revenue collection from licence fees, at Rs. 1,293

million, recorded a 6 per cent growth in 2000. This was

largely due to an increase in licence fees on motor vehicles

(Rs.1,125 million) reflecting the new registration of motor

vehicles, which totalled 90,000 in 2000. Licence fees on

motor vehicles accounted for 87 per cent of the revenue

collection from total licence fees, while the balance amount

was mainly collected through the issue of liquor licences.

Of the total licence fees on motor vehicles, 60 per cent was

collected from the Western province.

Despite the reduction of stamp duty rates on

mortgages, stamp duty collection increased by 7 per cent

to Rs. 1,468 million in 2000, maintaining the same rate of

growth recorded in the previous year. This indicates the

increased volume of property transactions, which were liable

for stamp duty in 2000. Of the total stamp duty revenue,

70 per cent was raised from the Western Province.

The balance revenue of Rs.1,101 million comprised

mainly court fines (Rs.341 million), fees under the Motor

Traffic Act (Rs.227 million) and interest earnings on

previous lending to employees of PCs through the advance

account (Rs.220 million).

Total revenue collected by the Western PC amounted

to Rs.5,062 million in 2000 and accounted for 67 per cent

of the total revenue in the PCs. As the revenue collection

responsibility of the North - East PC remained with the

central government, the balance revenue was raised by the

other six PCs. Revenue collection from the Central PC

(Rs.573 million), North Western PC (Rs. 576 million) and

Southern PC (Rs.559 million) represented 69 per cent of

the balance revenue generation.

In 2000, PCs continued to perform their agency function of collecting revenue on behalf of local governments. Although the revenue from stamp duty and court fines has been devolved to the LGs, the collection of this revenue has been undertaken by PCs. Accordingly, PCs collected a sum of Rs. 1,809 million from these sources on behalf of LGs in 2000. The transfer of this revenue to LGs is based on the request made by the respective LGs.

Expenditure

Total expenditure of PCs rose by 24 per cent to

Rs.37,328million in 2000, in comparison to a 7 per cent

increase in 1999. This was largely due to a substantial

increase in capital expenditure consequent to the transfer of

regional development activities to PCs by introducing

PSDP. This resulted in increasing the share of capital

expenditure in total expenditure of PCs to 22 per cent, from

8 per cent in the previous year. Meanwhile, current

expenditure rose by 10 per cent to Rs.28,856 million in

2000. The increase was reflected in the increase in the

salaries and wages of employees in the PCs by 9 per cent

and the increase of nonwage type expenditure by 14 per

cent.

According to the economic classification of

expenditure, salaries and wages accounted for 77 per cent

of the total current expenditure of PCs (Rs.22,189 million)

while the balance Rs.6,657 million covered all other current

expenses. The salaries and wages in the education and

health sectors accounted for 90 per cent of the total salary

bill in 2000. Total current expenditure also included current

transfers of Rs.2,304 million (8 per cent of total current

expenditure) to LGs to meet their salaries and wages.

On a functional basis, expenditure on social

infrastructure increased by 13 per cent to Rs.25,542 million,

raising the share in total current expenditure to 88 per cent

in 2000 from 86 per cent in 1999. Expenditure on education

(Rs.16,207 million) and health (Rs.5,513 million)

represented 85 per cent of expenditure on social outlays.

Meanwhile, current expenditure on provincial administration

(Rs.2,129 million) and economic functions (Rs.1,284

million) accounted for the balance 12 per cent of total

current expenditure in 2000.

The Western PC continued to be the largest spending

unit, accounting for 23 per cent of total current expenditure.

Recurrent expenditure of the Central, Southern, North-East

and North Western PCs remained on the 13 - 14 per cent

range as in 1999. The Uva PC continued to be the smallest

PC, accounting for only 7 per cent of total current

expenditure.

Capital Expenditure

Investment expenditure by PCs rose considerably during 2000. Its share in GDP was around 0.7 per cent in 2000 compared with 0.2 per cent in 1999 and 1998. As in the previous year, the North Western PC and the Western PC were the major subscribers to the investment programme, accounting for 15 per cent each of the total capital expenditure programme.

Total capital expenditure consisted of Rs.5,523 million

under PSDP, Rs. 1,988 million under criteria base grants and

matching grants and Rs. 812 million under other financial

sources. The PSDP mainly focused on developing health,

highways and education in the provinces. The total

expenditure incurred on these sectors accounted for over 80

per cent of the PSDP. The balance investments were in

other activities such as indigenous medicine, irrigation,

agriculture and rural development. The aim of this regional

development programme is to achieve a balanced regional

growth in the long run. Under the PSDP, the highest

provision, which accounted for about 15 per cent of the

total expenditure, was made to the North Western PC, while

1 5 0

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

the allocations to the other PCs ranged from 8-14 per cent.

Other capital expenditure incurred under criteria based

grants and matching grants amounted to Rs. 1,988 million.

These investments were mainly in the areas of acquisition

of fixed assets and rehabilitation and improvements of

capital assets. Investments undertaken through PCs' own

resources were only a small fraction of total investment and

these expenditures were limited to the acquisition of fixed

assets. In view of the resource constraint, the capital

expenditure programme of PCs needs to be closely

monitored and rationalised, particularly to avoid non-priority

locally funded capital programmes involving purchase of

vehicles, furniture and equipments.

Central Government Transfers

Total grants from the central government to PCs increased

significantly by 38 per cent to Rs.31,543 million in 2000,

compared to an 11 per cent increase in 1999. Total central

government grants to PCs comprised block grants of

Rs.23,220 million, Provincial Specific Development Grants

(PSDG) of Rs.5,523 million, criteria based grants of

Rs. 1,323 million and matching grants of Rs.665 million.

Transfer of block grants to meet the resource gap in the

current expenditure programme increased by 5 per cent.

Meanwhile, transfers through criteria based grants and

matching grants, which were targetted at other capital

expenditure programme of PCs, increased by 20 per cent

in 2000. However, with the implementation of the PSDP,

total central government transfers for capital expenditure

programmes of PCs increased to Rs.8,218 million in 2000

from Rs.2,433 million in 1999.

8.6 Public Enterprise Reforms

International economic developments imposed constraints on

the scheduled public enterprise reform program for the year

2000. Proceeds from privatisation amounted to Rs.401

million as against a targeted sum of Rs.30,000 million

envisaged in the budget 2000. A substantial portion of

privatisation proceeds (Rs. 200 million) was received on

account of Lanka Lubricants Ltd. The realisation of a lower

quantum of privatisation proceeds was due largely to the

non-sale of Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) shares in the

international market. It was expected to seek an

international placement for SLT through a further divestiture

of its shares. However, depressed international market

conditions for telecommunication shares prevented the

listing of SLT shares overseas. Nevertheless, progress was

made in reforming enterprises in the agricultural and

manufacturing sectors during the year. The Public Enterprise

Reform Commission (PERC) also continued its preparatory

work for the restructuring and privatisation of some key

public enterprises in the near future.

The divestiture of shares owned by the government in

Malwatte Valley Plantations Ltd continued the process of

privatisation in the plantations sector in the year 2000. The

transaction comprised the sale of 20 per cent of shares of

the company by way of an Initial Public Offer (IPO)

through the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE). Proceeds from

this divestiture generated a sum of Rs.40 million. The IPO

made in 2000 was consequent to a sale of 51 per cent of

shares of the company to a strategic investor, Waymba

Plantation (Pvt.) Ltd, in 1997. The sale of government

shares in the Malwatte Plantations company is expected to

lead to improved performance of the company while

generating positive externalities to the plantations sector.

The private sector involvement in the agriculture sector

continued in 2000 with activities of the Pelwehera and

Hingurakgoda Seed Paddy farms helping to improve seed

paddy production. The privatisation of these two enterprises

to CIC Fertiliser (PVT) Ltd, through land lease and sale

of movable assets on tender, helped bring in much needed

technology and know-how to seed production. Improved

crop management techniques together with the introduction

of new fertiliser mixtures and increased mechanization have

resulted in increasing seed production and enhancing the

quality of seed. The privatisation of hitherto loss making

seed production enterprises has also generated savings to the

budget. The sale of movable assets of these two enterprises

procured a sum of Rs.3 million as revenue to the

government in 2000. The contribution made by the

privatisation of these two enterprises has been significant

especially in the light of its impact on further encouraging

private sector participation in the production of quality seed

in sufficient quantity which would directly lead to a

productivity improvement in the agricultural sector.

Meanwhile, a part of the sugar plantation in Kantale Sugar Industries was leased out to Agro Trading Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd. for a maize project approved by BOI in 2000. The lease of these lands constitutes an important development in the privatisation of Kantale Sugar Industries as this enterprise, originally privatised in 1993 and brought under government ownership again in 1997 under the Rehabilitation of Public Enterprises Act, could not be re-divested to the private sector for a substantial period of time. Consequently, a part of the sugar plantation was leased out in the year 2000 for a 6 month period raising a sum of Rs.4 million as revenue to the government.

The majority sale (51%) of shares of Bogala Graphite

Lanka Ltd. took place in 2000 with the divestiture of these

shares to a German strategic investor, Graphit Kroptmuhl

AG for a sum of Rs.154 million. The privatisation process

of Bogala Graphite Ltd. was started in 1993 with an IPO

of 39 per cent of shares to the general public and the

transfer of 10 per cent of shares to employees. The

1 5 1

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

involvement of a strategic investor is expected to bring in

much needed investment and technological know-how to the

manufacturing sector.

The privatisation process for the sale of 40 per cent

shares of Air Lanka Ltd was completed in January, 2001.

The privatisation of Air Lanka entailed the divestiture of a

40 per cent equity stake to a strategic partner, Emirates

Airlines Ltd, with management control. A financial offer of

US$ 70 million was made by Emirates Ltd, for 40 per cent

of the shares of the air line. The transaction was executed

in two stages with the transfer of 26 per cent of shares in

1998 for a total of US$ 45 million and the balance 14 per

cent of shares being transferred in January, 2001 for a sum

of US$ 25 million. The business partnership with Emirates

has focused on fleet renewal, schedule expansion, product

enhancement, human resource development and the upgrade

of information technology systems. The airline has been

able to modernise its fleet with the purchase of 6 brand

new airbuses during 1999 and 2000 and the phasing out of

its old fleet of Tristars. With the completion of the re­

flecting program in 2000, SriLankan Airlines (SLA) was an

all Airbus carrier at the end of the year. The expanded fleet

has enabled the airline to increase its services to existing

destinations while the route network has also grown to

incorporate new destinations. Synergies have been generated

through the strategic partnership with Emirates with

increased code-share flights between the two airlines. In the

field of information technology, new computerised systems

have been introduced covering nearly all major areas of the

company's activities.

The PERC continued its preparatory work in the year

under review for the reform of some selected public

enterprises in the near future. Accordingly, work on some

key public enterprises such as the Ceylon Electricity Board

(CEB), the Postal Department and the National Insurance

Corporation (NIC) progressed in the year 2000.

8.7 Financing of the Deficit

In view of the shortfall in revenue collection and the sharp increase in current expenditure; the total resource gap of the budget expanded considerably by 49 per cent to Rs. 124,541 million in 2000. Approximately 95 per cent of this resource gap (Rs. 118,500 million) was financed from domestic sources due to a reduced inflow of foreign financing including substantially lower than expected proceeds from privatisation. Net foreign resources available for budgetary purposes in 2000 was only Rs.5,640 million compared to Rs.8,245 million in 1999. Meanwhile, proceeds from privatisation at Rs.401 million, were well below the expected target of Rs 30,000 million in 2000.

There was a sharp increase in the government demand

for resources inithe domestic market during the year. The

total net borrowing from domestic sources increased to Rs.

Chart 8.5 Deficit Financing

118,500 million in 2000 from Rs.74,876 million in 1999.

Consequently, the total domestic borrowing in relation to

GDP increased from 6.8 per cent to 9.4 per cent between

the two years. The domestic non-bank sector was able to

finance only 55 per cent (Rs. 65,110 million) of the

domestic resource requirement due to limited availability of

resources. Consequently, the government was compelled to

meet the balance resource requirement from the banking

system. As a result, borrowings from the banking system

more than doubled to Rs.53,389 million (4.3 per cent of

GDP) in 2000 from Rs.25,996 million (2.4 per cent of

GDP) in 1999. This was the highest level of bank

borrowings by the government recorded during the last

decade.

As in the previous year, Treasury bonds, Treasury bills

and Rupee loans were the key instruments used in

mobilising resources from the domestic market. However,

in line with the strategy of market orientation of

government debt, Treasury bonds played a major role in

raising resources from the domestic market. In 2000, the

total issue of Treasury bonds amounted to Rs. 125,322

million. The total borrowing under the Treasury bond

programme, on a cash basis, however amounted to

Rs.90,535 million accounting for 76 per cent of the total

financing from domestic sources. The comparable figure in

1999 was Rs.53,379 million. During the first half of 2000,

Treasury bonds were issued with a maturity of 2 - 6 years

with coupon rates ranging from 10.75 - 11.75 per cent.

Interest rates increased sharply in the domestic market

during second half of 2000 due to a substantial increase in

demand for resources by the government. The weighted

average interest rate on 2 year Treasury bonds increased to

22.19 per cent in December 2000 from 12.0 per cent in

May 2000. The corresponding rate at the beginning of

January 2000 was 13.00 per cent. Hence, the issue of

Treasury bonds with longer maturities was restricted to

minimise the borrowing cost as the mobilisation of fund

during a period of temporary high interest rates is not a

prudent debt management strategy. As a result, during the

1 5 2

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

second half of 2000, only Treasury bonds with maturities

of 2-3 years were issued.

The interest rate increase in the domestic market was

considered a short-term phenomenon and hence the coupon

rates on bonds was not revised in line with the rise in

domestic market interest rates. Therefore, there was a

significant margin between the coupon rate and the

weighted average yield rate during the second half of 2000.

This led to a total cash shortfall of Rs.9,339 million in the

Treasury bond programme, creating difficulties for cash

management by the Treasury. The corresponding cash

shortfall in 1999 was only Rs.2,572 million. The adverse

implications of cash shortfalls on Treasury cash

management could be minimised either by maintaining a

flexible coupon rate system in line with market interest

rates or by the provision of a contingencies facility at the

time of budget preparation to meet the likely cash shortfalls

under a given borrowing programme. Continuing with last

year's trend, the banking sector increased its share in total

purchased issues from 5 to 31 per cent in 2000 with

subscriptions amounting to Rs. 28,342 million. While

institutional investors such as the EPF and the NSB

continued to maintain the dominant position, other non-bank

investors played a major role in the bond market increasing

their share to 62 per cent in 2000 from 59 per cent in 1999.

The popularity of this guilt edge security among the general

public was enhanced due to increased awareness, attractive

interest rates and the marketability of the instrument.

In line with the market oriented medium-term debt

strategy of the government, the reliance on the Rupee loan

programme in financing the deficit was further reduced in

2000. Although, gross borrowings through the Rupee loan

programme in 2000 amounted to Rs.42,210 million in

comparison to Rs.22,884 million in 1999, with the

repayment of Rs.40,378 million, net resource mobilisation

declined to Rs. 1,832 million in 2000 from Rs. 11,484

million in 1999. The entire Rupee loan programme was

subscribed to by captive type investors and interest rates

were maintained at a lower level than the interest rates of

other government securities of comparable maturity that

prevailed in the market. As in the past, EPF continued to

be the major subscriber to the Rupee loan programme, with

a gross investment of Rs.34,038 million, followed by the

NSB with an investment of Rs.7,154 million. These two

institutions accounted for 98 per cent of the total Rupee

loan subscription in 2000 in comparison to 78 per cent in

1999. The remains sum of Rs.937 million was purchased

by the Public Services Provident Fund (PSPF) and other

small captive type investors. The total borrowings included

a special Rupee loan of Rs. 11,000 million issued to the EPF

at a rate of 11 per cent with an optional repayment in 5-6

years and another special Rupee loan issue of Rs.8,000

million at an interest rate of 11.90 per cent with a maturity

of 1 year. The remain sum of Rs. 23,210 million was issued

with an optional maturity of 8-10 years at an interest rate

of 12.00 per cent per annum.

The borrowing limit of the Treasury bills programme

was revised upward from Rs.125 billion to Rs.135 billion

in May, 2000. This additional borrowing facility (Rs.10

billion) was fully' utilised during the second half of the year.

Initially, new Treasury bills amounting to Rs.3 billion were

issued with shorter maturities with the expectation of an

improvement in the fiscal situation towards the end of 2000.

Nevertheless, these maturing bills were reissued towards end

2000, as the fiscal situation continued to deteriorate. Total

net borrowings from Treasury bills on a cash basis

amounted to Rs.6,147 million. High interest rates, especially

during the second half of 2000, and shifting of a large

volume of Treasury bills to one year bills led to a cash

shortfall of Rs 3,853 million in 2000. As in the previous

year, the Central Bank intervention in the primary market

remained high in 2000. Of the total new issues, 70 per cent

was absorbed by the Central Bank with the intention of

releasing it gradually to the market through its secondary

window. The Central Bank intervention in the primary

market on re-issues also remained high. The Bank

purchased 24 per cent of the total Treasury bill re-issues

in 2000 in comparison to 19 per cent in 1999. Meanwhile,

Central Bank holdings of Treasury bills and Treasury bonds

increased sharply through the reverse repurchase facility

reflecting the liquidity shortage in the market resulting from

declining external official reserves. As a consequence of

these developments, Treasury bills and Treasury bonds

holding by the Central Bank (in a book value basis)

increased by Rs.41,330 million to Rs.66,593 million by end

2000. Meanwhile, Treasury bill holdings of commercial

banks declined during the year due to active trading in the

secondary market. Borrowings from the domestic market

through administrative arrangements amounted to Rs.3,178

million in 2000. The main sources of administratively

borrowed funds were the NSB and the ETF.

Total government borrowings from the banking system

amounted to Rs.53,389 million in 2000, in comparison to

Rs.25,996 million in 1999. The banking sector financed 43

per cent of the overall deficit in 2000 in comparison to 31

per cent in 1999. Net credit to the government by the

Central Bank, at Rs.44,840 million, funded 36 per cent of

the overall fiscal deficit, in comparison to 25 per cent in

1999. This share was only 6 per cent in 1998. The

borrowing from the Central Bank was mainly reflected in

an increase in the holdings of Treasury bonds (Rs.28,602

million) and Treasury bills (Rs. 12,727 million) and

increased transfer of funds under the provisional advances

(Rs.4,200 million). It is pertinent to mention that a bulk of

this increase was not necessarily due to the government

borrowing from the Central Bank but due to the market

1 5 3

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

using its holdings of government securities to obtain

liquidity from the Central Bank. Even though the increased

dependency on the Central Bank to bridge the resource gap

of the budget is a matter for concern in view of its

inflationary impact, it enabled the Central Bank to manage

the rupee liquidity to support economic activities of the

country i.e. preventing a liquidity crunch in the domestic

economy.

Net credit to the government from both Domestic

Banking Units (DBUs) and Foreign Currency Banking Units

(FCBUs) of commercial banks amounted to Rs.8,549

million in 2000. The borrowing from DBUs (Rs.3,762

million) was a combined outcome of an increased utilisation

of an overdraft facility (Rs. 10,591 million), an increase in

other liabilities of the government (Rs.2,076 million), a

decline in debt securities holdings (Rs.4,484 million), a

decrease in liability on account of import bills (Rs.3,929

million) and a build up of deposits (Rs.490 million) in

2000. The net borrowing from FCBUs (Rs.4,787 million)

was mainly the net result of a special external borrowing

of US$ 100 million (Rs.7,754 million) arranged through

FCBUs and the repayment of an FCBU loan of US$ 41

million (Rs.3,138 million) that had been borrowed in 1998.

Gross foreign borrowings in 2000 amounted to

Rs.23,777 million in comparison to Rs.22,974 million in

1999. In comparison to the foreign borrowing programme

of Rs.35,800 million in the original budget, the utilisation

was only 66 per cent due to the delay in the

implementation of some large projects on account of

administrative and procedural matters. The under-utilisation

of foreign aid in 1998 and 1999 was 10 per cent and 23

per cent, respectively. Foreign borrowings were entirely in

the form of project and programme loans received from

multilateral and bilateral sources. Japan (Rs. 12,437 million),

ADB (Rs.5,368 million), and IDA (Rs.3,108 million)

accounted for about 90 per cent of total gross borrowings

in 2000. With the repayment of Rs.23,282 million, net

foreign borrowings available for financing the deficit was

only Rs. 496 million (0.04 per cent of GDP). This was

sufficient to finance only 0.04 per cent of the budget deficit

in 2000. Net foreign borrowings in 1999 and 1998 were

Rs. 1,484 million and Rs.lO, 197 million, respectively.

Foreign grants received for budgetary purposes also

declined to Rs.5,146 million compared to Rs.6,761 million

in 1999. The sharp reduction of foreign resources in

financing the deficit over these years has exerted additional

pressures on domestic resources pushing interest rates

upwards. In this regard, it is important to take effective

steps to improve foreign aid utilisation by addressing

relevant systematic issues as well as project specific issues

with the help of implementing agencies.

8.8 Government Debt

The total government debt stock increased during 2000 by

Rs. 167,369 million (16 per cent) to Rs.1,218,700 million

as at the end of 2000. Consequently, the stock of

government debt as a percentage of GDP increased from

95 per cent in 1999 to 97 per cent in 2000. A substantial

expansion in domestic borrowing accounted for nearly 80

per cent of the increase, while the stock of foreign debt

increased in rupee terms by Rs. 34,174 million (7 per cent),

largely reflecting the impact of exchange rate variations.

Domestic Debt

Domestic borrowings grew by 25 per cent to Rs. 676,660

million in 2000. Domestic borrowings as a percentage of

GDP rose to 54 per cent in 2000 from 49 per cent in 1999.

The trend towards greater domestic borrowing was also

reflected in the share of domestic debt to total debt, which

increased from 52 per cent in 1999, to 56 per cent in 2000.

There was a faster growth in outstanding debt in medium

and long-term debt instruments than in short term

instruments, although both recorded a higher growth in

2000, than in 1999.

Medium and long-term debt stock increased by 27 per

cent in 2000, raising its share in total domestic debt to 69

per cent. The increase was mainly on account of higher

government borrowings through Treasury bonds reflecting

the shift in public debt towards more market oriented debt

instruments with longer maturities. The share of Treasury

bonds in total domestic debt increased from 19 per cent in

1999 to 30 per cent in 2000. During the year there were

new bond issues of Rs. 125,322 million, while Rs.26,065

million worth of bonds were settled. The net result was to

increase the outstanding Treasury bond stock by Rs. 99,257

million to Rs.204,124 million by end 2000. As mentioned

earlier, Treasury bonds of shorter maturities were issued

during the second half of 2000. Consequently, the Treasury

bond portfolio was dominated by two and three-year bonds,

accounting for 69 per cent of the total outstanding Treasury

bond stock as at the end of 2000. For the first time, the

government issued Callable Treasury bonds (two-year bonds

with call options). The special feature of these bonds is that

the government reserves the option of redeeming these

bonds at the end of the first year of issue, or on any date

thereafter. However, because of the high interest rates

quoted at the primary auctions, the government had to

discontinue their issuance after two issues.

Outstanding Rupee securities at end 2000, stood at

Rs.263,888 million. There has been a gradual reduction in

the use of Rupee loans as a source of government

financing, in line with the government's policy of reducing

the share of non-marketable securities in the debt market.

Its share in total domestic debt declined from 62 per cent

in 1997, to 48 per cent in 1999 and to 39 per cent in 2000.

Major subscribers to the Rupee loan programme were the

EPF and the NSB, together accounting for 98 per cent of

total investments in 2000.

The higher borrowing requirement of the government

and the rise in interest rates compelled the government to

increase its borrowings through short-term debt instruments.

The slowdown in the growth of short-term borrowing

observed in 1999, was reversed in 2000, with short-term

1 5 5

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

borrowings growing by 18 per cent (Rs.32,131 million) in

2000, compared to 8 per cent in 1999. However, the share

of short-term debt in domestic debt declined from 32 per

cent to 31 per cent between the two years as medium term

borrowings increased at a higher rate. Treasury bill holdings

expanded by Rs. 10 billion to Rs. 135 billion by end 2000.

Provisional advances stood at Rs.27,169 million, while other

short-term debt obligations of the government increased by

64 per cent (Rs. 17,931 million) to Rs. 45,852 million at the

end of 2000.

Outstanding borrowings from the banking system

grew by 42 per cent (Rs.59,359 million) in 2000, to

Rs.199,030 million, accounting for 29 per cent of the total

outstanding domestic debt. The major portion of this

increase (Rs.48,911 million) was on account of borrowings

from the Central Bank. Accordingly, the share of

outstanding debt to the Central Bank in the total outstanding

domestic debt increased from 9 per cent at end 1999, to

14 per cent at end 2000. The increase in the other

obligations of the government indicates a sharp increase in

government liabilities to the commercial banking system

arising out of higher borrowing through overdraft facilities

at the two state banks.

In order to develop the market for government debt

securities further by improving efficiency and enabling

better supervision of companies dealing in government

securities, revisions were made to the regulations governing

primary dealers. Under the new regulations only companies

set up exclusively for trading in government securities, with

a minimum dedicated capital of Rs.150 million, were

allowed to function as primary dealers. As a result, the

number of companies operating in the Primary Dealer

System declined from eighteen to eight. A surveillance unit

has also been set up in the Public Debt Department to

conduct off-site surveillance and on-site supervision of

primary dealers. Further strengthening of the PDS will

require a revision to the existing legal and regulatory

framework governing primary dealers in order to

accommodate the introduction of an electronic bidding

system and the adoption of the Global Master Repurchase

Agreement, as well as to develop a more rigorous process

for the licensing of primary dealers. The proposed

introduction of a scripless security system will also

contribute to the further development of the market for

government debt securities.

Foreign Debt

The total external debt outstanding increased by 7 per cent

(Rs.34,174 million) to Rs.542,040 million at the end of

2000. As a percentage of GDP however, the outstanding

foreign debt stock declined from 46 per cent in 1999 to 43

per cent in 2000. Its share in total public debt also declined

from 48 per cent in 1999 to 44 per cent in 2000.

A two-third of the increase (Rs.24,104 million) in the

external debt stock was due to exchange rate variations.

However, the impact of exchange rate variations in 2000

was lower than that experienced in 1999 (Rs,37,989 million)

and 1998 (Rs.65,522 million). Even though the rupee

depreciated sharply against the US dollar in 2000, its

impact on the foreign debt stock was limited to Rs. 10,056

million as only 18 per cent of the total foreign debt stock

is denominated in US dollars. The SDR denominated debt

stock increased by Rs. 10,322 million due to the depreciation

of the rupee against the SDR, and the depreciation of the

rupee against other currencies accounted for Rs.5,618

million of the increase in the debt stock. The appreciation

of the rupee against the Japanese yen, on the other hand,

had a favourable impact on the foreign debt stock of Rs.

1,892 million.

Concessional loans which make up almost 99 per cent

of the total foreign debt stock witnessed a 7.5 per cent

increase in its debt stock in 2000. The stock of non-

concessional loans declined by 32 per cent due to the

settlement of the outstanding portion of the Floating Rate

Note (FRN) issued in 1997. Project loans which account

for 88 per cent of the total outstanding debt portfolio

increased by 8 per cent, while non-project and commodity

loans increased by less than 1 per cent each. The

outstanding debt stock from bilateral sources which

accounts for 53 per cent of the total foreign debt stock

increased by only 6 per cent in 2000 while the debt

outstanding on account of multilateral sources increased by

9 per cent during 2000.

Debt Service Payments

Debt service payments increased by 69 per cent to

Rs.175,726 million in 2000, mainly due to large

amortisation payments on account of Rupee loans and

Treasury bonds. Accordingly, the ratio of debt service to

GDP rose from 9 per cent to 14 per cent in 2000, the

^highest ratio recorded in the last decade. Total amortisation

payments in 2000, amounted to Rs.104 billion, comprising

Rs.81 billion on account of domestic debt and Rs.23 billion

on account of foreign debt. Domestic amortisation payments

increased sharply by Rs. 60,922 million, while foreign debt

repayments increased by Rs. 1,842 million during the year.

Interest payments grew by 15 per cent to Rs.71,200

million in 2000. However, the ratio of interest payments to

current expenditure declined from 30 per cent to 28 per

cent in 2000, reflecting the high rate of increase in current

expenditure. Of the total interest payments, 87 per cent was

on account of domestic borrowing. Interest payments on

domestic debt increased by 17 per cent in 2000, compared

to 12 per cent in 1999, due to higher domestic borrowing

Source: Central Bank of Sri Lanka

by the government. Interest payments on medium and long-

term debt increased by 21 per cent in 2000, compared to

16 per cent in 1999 as a result of increased borrowing from

medium and long-term instruments with semi-annual interest

payments. Interest payments on short-term debt declined by

2 per cent in 2000, due to the lower interest rates that

prevailed in 1999 and the first half of 2000 and the shift

of Treasury bill borrowings from shorter maturities (3

months) to longer maturities (over 6 months), where interest

payments would only be made in 2001. Interest payments

on foreign debt increased by 3 per cent to Rs.9,015 million,

a lower rate of expansion compared to the 20 per cent

increase recorded in 1999.

Even though the depreciation of the rupee raises the

value of the external debt stock in rupee terms, it is

misleading to infer that it would, on a net basis, impose

an additional debt repayment burden on the government.

This is because foreign debt is repaid by the government

out of the current year's revenue and the revenue too rises

with the depreciation of the currency. It has been estimated

that the net budgetary gain to the government by a

depreciation of the currency by 1 per cent amounts to

Rs. 1,340 million. Hence, there is no additional btfrden on

the budget.
