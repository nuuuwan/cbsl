Accordingly, with the removal of the import duty on crude oil in February 2000, an excise tax of 45 per cent was imposed on diesel, kerosene and petrol. This measure simplified the taxation of petroleum products by unifying the hitherto existing excise rates of 15 percent, 50 per cent and zero per cent levied on diesel, petrol and kerosene, respectively. In November 2000, the excise duty rate on these three products was revised downward to 35 percent.",

The prevailing restrictions on foreign equity holdings in the banking and insurance sectors were relaxed by allowing foreign ownership up to 60 per cent in banking institutions and -90 per cent in insurance. The increase in foreign equity ownership is expected to improve the capital base and encourage foreign fund flows and help develop Colombo as a regional financial centre. Non-nationals were also permitted to hold 100 per cent stakes in stock broking firms licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from 2000 onwards. With a view to revitalising unit trusts, the government permitted investments by non-residents in units of equity/growth unit trusts where relevant trust deeds do not permit more than 20 per cent investment in government securities. Such investments are to be routed through the Share Investment External Rupee Accounts (SIERA) to ensure the monitoring of inflows and outflows of funds. In order to expand and diversify investments of venture capital companies, the government amended the law for venture capital companies to opt out of the tax holiday period, which was hitherto linked to investments in specified risk ventures. This move enabled venture capital companies to make investments of their own choice.",

As a percentage of GDP, non-tax revenue, which had remained stable at around 2.7 per cent in 1998 and 1999, fell to 2.3 per cent in 2000. Lower profit and dividend transfers from public enterprises mainly contributed to this decrease. Although the budget envisaged profit and dividend transfers of Rs.8.8 billion in 2000, only Rs.6.3 billion was realised. As compared to 1999, revenue from profits and dividends (excluding Central Bank profit transfers) declined by 18 per cent in 2000. Losses incurred by the CPC in 2000, and the lower taxable profits of SLT due to large investment allowances and depreciation allowances claimed in 2000, the reduction in international settlements on incoming calls from abroad, as well as the exchange losses suffered on foreign loan repayments due to the sharp depreciation of the rupee during the year, were the major contributory factors for this decline. Central Bank profit transfers increased by Rs.200 million to Rs.3,200 million in 2000. Interest income collected on loans given to public enterprises grew by 4 per cent in 2000 compared to 3 per cent in 1999. The main sources of interest income",

Curtailment of current expenditure while improving the revenue collection were mainly responsible for the decrease in operational losses of these two public enterprises. The substantial level of operational losses at Sri Lanka Railway indicates the necessity of an upward adjustment of railway fares and structural reforms to maintain the viability of the enterprise. Meanwhile, current transfers to other levels of government declined to Rs. 1,424 million in 2000 from Rs.1,629 million in 1999 due to resource constraints of the central government.",
