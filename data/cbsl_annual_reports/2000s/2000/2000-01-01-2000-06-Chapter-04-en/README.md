4. INDUSTRY

4.1 Overall Trends

In 2000, the industrial sector in general benefited from

healthy developments in the international economies,

favourable domestic economic conditions and policies,

advances in information technology and efficient

management techniques. The overall industrial output,

measured as the output of factory industries, grew by 11

per cent in 2000 compared to 4.5 per cent in 1999. The

output of factory industries accounted for 81 per cent of

the manufacturing sector and contributed 23 per cent to

overall economic growth in 2000. The growth of industrial

output during the first three-quarters of the year was 12.5

per cent, but moderated to 6.7 per cent in the last quarter,

mainly reflecting the impact of changes in base as recovery

started during the second half of 1999. Production capacity

in the industrial sector increased by 4.6 per cent in 2000.

A total of 131 new enterprises registered under the BOI and

the Ministry of Industrial Development, commenced

commercial operations during the year.

The main contributors to this healthy industrial growth

were the export-oriented industries led by the apparel and

textiles industry. The apparel and textiles sector, the largest

sub sector in the export oriented industries, grew by 16.2

per cent in volume terms and contributed 59 per cent of

the industrial sector growth in 2000. The average

international price of apparel exported by Sri Lanka

increased by 5.3 per cent during the year. Other export-

oriented industries that registered a higher growth in 2000,

were manufactured rubber, plastics, machinery, processed

diamonds, electronic parts and processed tea.

Industries catering to the domestic market showed a

mixed performance. Output was higher in the sub-sectors

of soft drinks, milk products, processed meat, biscuits, hard

liquor, petroleum products, chemicals, fabricated metals,

building materials and soap and detergent. The domestic

demand for these products increased due to aggressive

advertising, improved distribution methods, attractive

packaging and improved quality. However, output in the

sub-sectors of tobacco products, sugar, PVC products,

batteries and metal products declined during the year.

Healthy economic growth in USA and the European

countries in 2000, stimulated demand for major export items

from Sri Lanka. Rapid recovery in East Asian countries and

the subsequent appreciation of their currencies helped

restore the international competitive edge which Sri Lanka's

exports had enjoyed. Further, the favourable domestic

economic environment that prevailed in early 2000, coupled

with low inflation and low interest rates and improved

labour productivity, helped improve the international

competitiveness of Sri Lanka's exports.

Export-oriented industries were able to increase access

to international markets with improvements in information

technology (IT) and utilisation of modern equipment. IT

networks helped manufacturers to obtain market information

faster from their trade representatives abroad enabling them

to supply highly demanded products in time. Many firms

in 2000 aimed at acquiring new technology and installing

modern equipment. Fiscal incentives offered under the

Advanced Technology Programme encouraged industrialists

to modernise their production processes. Under this

programme, 409 manufacturers had imported Rs.11.4 billion

worth of machinery as at end December 2000. New

technology and automated systems have minimised human

error, maintained quality consistency, ensured higher

productivity and enhanced worker motivation. Close

working relationships with leading international buyers and

the establishment of joint ventures helped to obtain more

export orders.

On the domestic policy front, the government

continued with its private sector led export oriented

industrial policy while playing an aggressive role in

facilitating international trade. The government

operationalised the Indo-Lanka Free Trade Agreement in

March 2000. The government also signed an agreement

with EU during the latter part of the year which enabled

Sri Lanka's exporters to enter the EU market without quota

restrictions. This came in to effect from 1 January 2001.

As brand marketing is becoming an important aspect in

international trade, the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka

(BOI) and the Export Development Board (EDB) organised

several trade missions to explore new opportunities and

establish contacts with reputed brand manufacturers,

encouraging them to set up buying houses in Sri Lanka.

This helped to reduce the degree of third party

intermediation and created closer relations with leading

international buyers.

Various incentives introduced in successive budgets

have had beneficial effects on the development of the

industrial sector. These include tariff and tax concessions

for the importation of machinery and raw materials,

development of specific infrastructure facilities in industrial

parks and regional export processing zones and the

improvement in the administration of apparel quotas. The

government drafted a Master Plan for Industrialisation and

Investment Promotion in collaboration with the Japan

International Coorperation Agency (JICA) and the United

Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) to

reshape the industrial strategy and to expose Sri Lankan

manufacturers to regional and global competition. Under

this Master Plan, six industries were identified for future

promotion and specific strategies were formulated to

develop those industries. The need to rationalise investment

incentives was emphasised in the budget proposals in 2000.

Under this, a specific proposal was introduced to rationalise

some of the concessions offered by BOI. The Budget 2001

proposed similar incentives and facilities for both BOI and

non-BOI firms to harness the future growth potential of

non-BOI industries and to remove distortions and create a

level playing field.

Manufacturers have introduced various measures to

reduce the costs of production, such as sub-contracting, out­

sourcing of production, enhancing the efficiency of working

capital, reducing wastage, waste material recycling and

saving energy. However, the cost escalation during the latter

part of 2000, caused by the high cost of imported raw

materials, increased fuel, electricity, telephone, and port

charges and freight rates, imposed a burden on the industrial

sector.

Industrial sector activities benefited from the

continuous improvement in basic industrial infrastructure

such as telecommunications, expansion in electricity

generation, port facilities and the reduction in customs

delays in the country. However, an inadequate road and

transport network remains an impediment to growth in the

industrial sector. The year was marked by a lower incidence

of strikes and labour disputes, and improved labour

relations. Many firms signed collective agreements with

labour unions to maintain industrial peace in the working

place. The pressure for wage increases was low mainly due

to low inflation during the early part of the year.

Several large companies provided comprehensive in-house training at every stage of production to provide their employees with a knowledge of the latest technologies. However, further improvements in skills development are necessary for faster growth of industrial activities. The scarcity of both skilled and unskilled labour is also emerging as a major problem. A review of labour policy and subsequent changes are essential to ensure a more flexible labour market consistent with free market economic policies for the fulfilment of future labour requirements in the industrial sector.

Lack of proper legal provisions for easy and speedy

liquidation or re-structuring of sick industries, and the

environmental pollution created by industrial wastage

especially in rubber, plastic, metal, wood and food

processing industries, have become a cause for concern.

Certain companies in the rubber manufacturing sub-sector

have invested in environmental pollution control methods

such as water treatment plants, air purification systems,

sewerage disposal systems and recycling waste to minimise

of pollution and increase the efficient management of waste

generations.

4.2 Production

As in previous years, growth in factory industries in 2000,

was estimated on the basis of the Industrial Production

Survey-2000 of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. This Survey

covered 480 industrial enterprises outside the purview of

BOI, production of public sector industries and export data

relating to BOI enterprises. The Survey did not cover the

other two sectors, viz., processing of tea, rubber and

coconut and small industries, whose output was estimated

separately using other information. The output of factory

industries grew by 11 per cent in real terms and 16.8 per

cent in nominal terms, resulting in an implicit price deflator

of 5.2 per cent for the output of factory industries in 2000.

Public sector industries grew by 24.1 per cent, while

private sector industries grew by 10.5 per cent during the

year. The contribution of the public sector to industrial

output was 12 per cent and that of the private sector was

88 per cent. Of this, BOI industries accounted for 65 per

cent and non-BOI for 23 per cent. The impetus for growth

in industrial output in 2000 came mainly from three of the

nine industrial categories, viz., textiles, apparel and leather

products; chemicals, petroleum, rubber and plastic products

and food, beverages and tobacco products. These categories

accounted for 94 per cent of the growth in the industrial

sector in 2000.

Private Sector Industries

Output of private sector industries grew by 10.5 per cent

in 2000 compared to 5.3 per cent in 1999. Private sector

industries accounted for 94 per cent of industrial production

in 2000. Output growth in BOI industries was estimated at

14 per cent in 2000, compared to 5.7 per cent in the

previous year. Output in the non-BOI sector grew by 6.2

per cent compared to 5 per cent in 1999. The Industrial

Production Survey-2000 of the Central Bank indicated an

Industrial Re-Structuring and Enabling Facilitation Box 5

Introduction

Business failure is a common phenomenon in a

dynamic market economy. Firms fail as a result of both

external and internal factors. The most significant

external factor is innovation in technology that results

in 'creative destruction' described by Schumpeter

(1934) and Aghion and Howitt (1992). Old firms are

replaced by new firms as the economy discards old

goods and services and old techniques in favour of new

goods, services and techniques'. In the history of

technological innovation, for example, the 'slide-rule'

industry was replaced by the 'calculator' industry. Other

external factors, are market developments such as

increased competition,-relative cost of inputs, flexibility

of labour markets and government policy changes.

Internal factors are lack of managerial skills and labour

disputes. When business failures are beyond the control

of the firm and cannot be corrected within a reasonable

time frame, the legal framework should enable the

transfer of capital locked in those ventures to other

productive activities. However; when the reasons for

failure are temporary and can be corrected with the

assistance o f an outside organisation, those enterprises

should be given opportunity to reorganise themselves.

To address those issues, some countries have introduced a specific legal framework and legislation to facilitate easy and speedy adjustment and re­organisation of firms in financial difficulties. Important examples are the United States Bankruptcy Code, and the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provision) Act,

1985, of India. These initiatives help enterprises to release capital locked in failed projects for re­investment in viable projects.

Legal Impediments for Reorganisation and Restructuring in Sri Lanka

The existing legislation in Sri Lanka hinders smooth

business re-organisation and restructuring. The existing

labour laws do not permit retrenchment of excess

workers and discourage the restructuring of enterprises.

The Termination of Employment of Workmen Act,

No.45 of 1971, for example, prohibits firms with 15 or

more employees from laying off workers even on the

grounds of inefficiency, or lack of skills.2 Recovery of

Loans By Banks (Special Provisions) Act, No. 4 of

1990, and the loan recovery provisions in the statutes

relating to the establishment or incorporation of banks

in Sri Lanka do not contain sufficiently clear provisions

for granting facilities for the reorganisation of sick

industries.3 According to this Act, the Board of Directors

of a lending bank can sell by public auction any

property mortgaged to the bank as security to recover

th& loan, interest payments and other cost This *parate

execution* allows banks to recover secured loans by

auctioning the mortgaged property without a court order.

International Initiatives in Dealing with Restructuring and Reorganisation

US Initiative *

The Bankruptcy Code of the USA provides two distinct

forms of relief, Liquidation (Chapter 7) and

Reorganisation (Chapter l l ) .4 The vast majority of

bankruptcy filings in the United States involve

liquidation governed by Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy

Code. Chapter 7 allows the US trustee to collect a

debtor's non-exempt assets (assets that a debtor is not

allowed to retain) and convert them into cash. The

trustee then distributes the resulting funds to the

creditors in order of priority described in the Bankruptcy

Code. Creditors frequently receive only a portion, and

sometimes none, of the money owed to them by the

bankrupt debtor.

Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code allows the debtor to continue its business operations under a plan of re-organisation. Thus, it gives a chance

to a firm to restructure its finances so that it may continue to operate, provide its employees with jobs, pay its creditors, and produce a return for its stock holders. It also permits a liquidating plan, which often allows a firm to liquidate the business under more economically advantageous circumstances than a liquidation under

2 In a retrenchment situation the provisions of this Act require the employer to obtain either the consent of the employe© or the Commissioner of Labour for termination and thus the termination procedures take considerable time.

3 The banks' established under the statutes of Parliament were State Mortgage and Investment Bank, National Savings Bank, Bank of Ceylon, People'sBank, National Development Bank and DFCC Bank.

Chapter 7. It also permits the creditors to take a more

active role in fashioning the liquidation of assets and the

distribution of the proceeds than under Chapter 7.

Chapter 11 also contains special provisions to deal with

small businesses. A small business case is put on a 'fast

track' and treated differently from a regular Chapter 11

case.

As a first step of reorganisation under Chapter 11,

a written disclosure statement and a plan of

reorganisation must be filed with the court. The

disclosure statement is a document that contains

information concerning the assets, liabilities, and affairs

of the firm to enable a creditor to make an informed

judgement about the plan. After the disclosure statement

is approved, the firm can begin to solicit acceptance of

the plan, and creditors may also solicit rejection of the

plan.

Any party in interest may file an objection to

confirmation of a plan. The Bankruptcy Code requires

the court, after notice, to hold a hearing on the

confirmation of a plan. If no objection to the

confirmation is filed, the court may determine that the

plan has been proposed in good faith and according to

law. After the plan is confirmed, the debtor is bound by

the provisions of the plan of re-organisation. The

confirmed plan creates new contractual rights, replacing

or superseding pre-bankruptcy contracts.

The United States trustee is responsible for

monitoring the firm's operation of the business,

submitting operating reports and fees, applications for

compensation and reimbursement, plans and disclosure

statements, and creditors committees. The United States

trustee also imposes certain requirements on the firm

concerning matters such as reporting its monthly income

and operating expenses, the establishment of new bank

accounts and the payment of current employee

withholding and other taxes. By law, the firm must pay

a quarterly fee to the United States trustee for each

quarter until a plan is confirmed or the case is converted

or dismissed. The amount of fee, which may range from

US$250 to US$5,000 at present, depends upon the

amount of disbursements during each quarter. If the firm

fails to comply with the reporting requirements of the

United States trustee or orders of the Bankruptcy Court

or fails to take appropriate steps to bring the case to

confirmation, the debtor's Chapter 11 case may be

converted to a case under another Chapter of the Code

or the case may be dismissed.

Box 5 (Contd.) Indian Initiative

The Indian initiative came in the form of the Sick

Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act (SICA),

1985, with the objectives of ensuring timely detection

of sick and potentially sick industrial companies and to

expedite the revival of potentially viable units or closure

of non-viable units. Under this Act, the Board for

Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR),

consisting of a group of experts, was set up in January

1987 to determine and enforce preventive, remedial and

other measures with respect to sick industrial

companies.5 SICA applies to both public and private

sector industrial companies, excluding, small-scale

industrial undertakings or ancillary industrial

undertakings.

An industrial company is deemed 'sick' if the

accumulated losses of the company are equal to or more

than its net worth (paid up capital plus free reserves).

To be eligible for facilities under SICA, the company

has to have been in operation for at least five years after

the incorporation under the Companies Act, it should

have at least 50 workers on any day of the 12 months

preceding the end of the financial year with reference

to which sickness is claimed and it should have a

factory licence.

Where an industrial company becomes a sick

industrial company, the Board of Directors of the

company could make a reference to BIFR for

determination of the measures which shall be adopted

with respect to the company. The other parties who

could also make reference to BIFR are the central

government, the Reserve Bank of India, a state

government, a public financial institution, a state level

institution or a scheduled bank.

BIFR may inquire to determine whether the

company has become a sick industrial company upon

receipt of any such information. BIFR could appoint one

or more persons to the Board of Directors of the

company for safeguarding the financial and other

interests of the company

After making an inquiry, if BIFR is satisfied that

a company has become sick, it then decides if it is

practical for the company to enhance its net worth above

the accumulated losses within a reasonable time, and

allows sufficient time for the company to enhance its

networth. If BIFR decides that it is not possible for the

sick company to enhance its net worth above the

5 www.bifr.nic.in/

66

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

accumulated losses, it would take measures sueh as the

financial reconstruction of the sick industrial company;

changing the management of the sick industrial

company; amalgamating the sick industrial company with

any other company; the sale or lease of a part or whole

of any industrial undertaking of the sick industrial

company; rationalising managerial personnel, supervisory

staff and workmen in accordance with law; and any

other preventive, ameliorative and remedial measures as

may be appropriate.

Where the scheme, relates to preventive,

ameliorative, remedial and other measures with respect

to any sick industrial company, the scheme may provide

for financial assistance to the sick company by way of

; loans, advances," or guarantees from the central

government, a state government, any bank, a public

financial institution or state level institution or any

institution.

Guidelines for industrial reorganisation in Sri Lanka

A bankruptcy code should reinforce the working of

the market to bring about efficient allocation of

resources by providing a framework within which

enterprises could restructure their business in such a way

that maximises the value of the enterprises or where

appropriate, undergo an orderly liquidation of their

assets. The legal framework should not create or expose

a presumption in favour of restructuring/reorganising all

failing enterprises. The legal framework should ensure

that enterprises which are viable in the long run survive.

Currently, there does not exist any mechanism in Sri Lanka to facilitate the re-organisation of financially troubled or sick enterprises. * Moreover, prevailing labour laws and parate execution do not permit financially troubled enterprises to reorganise and

6 However, the Companies Act, No 17 of 1982, allows compa­nies registered in Sri Lanka under the Act to initiate a process of reconstruction of a company through binding arrangements with creditors and shareholders, by making an application to court. This Act also allows companies to wind up eitherby acourt order or voluntarily or subjectto the supervision of the court

Box 5 (Contd.)

continue the business operation, but only result in

closure of enterprises. Since the closure of enterprises

causes great cost to the economy by way of loss of

output and employment, default to creditors and low

return to entrepreneurs, it is extremely important to have

a sound mechanism in place to assist ailing enterprises

to overcome their problems, provided that the enterprises

are commercially viable and the problems are of

temporary nature.

Government should consider enacting legislation to

deal with the systematic reorganisation of financially

troubled small, medium and large-scale enterprises that

could be made financially viable. That legislation should

provide for a moratorium on debts payable to creditors

without interest on such debts, termination of

employment within a short period of time for reasons

such as inefficiency, and downsizing for reorganising

purposes with reasonable compensation, and speedy

reorganisation procedures and special provisions for

systematic liquidation of non-viable business entities.

The legal framework should also ensure that it is fair

to all parties, including competitors and.tax payers,

responds promptly to the urgent needs of the

entrepreneurs, is transparent in its operation, accessible

to all who need to use it and, encourages entrepreneurs

or managers to take timely or early action. It should

ensure that returns to creditors are maximised and

businesses that are viable in the; long run are not

liquidated. -

If financial failure was caused by inefficient management, then the provisions of this legislation should empower the authority that administers the reorganisation of enterprises, to take over the management or to appoint a suitable and competent management to administer the enterprises for a certain period or until the enterprises turns but to be commercially viable again.

A separate body with wide ranging powers

consisting of experts from both the private and public

sectors should be established to administer and monitor

the reorganisation of enterprises. Entrepreneurs could be

charged a reasonable fee for the services provided by

this body to cover its operational costs.

East Asian currencies making Sri Lankan apparel more

competitive in international markets. Rapidly improving

information technology and closer relations with trade

representatives in major markets helped obtain information

on the latest developments in markets and technology,

Performance in Major Industrial Sectors

Textiles, wearing apparel and leather products

Output in the textiles, wearing apparel and leather products category, the largest sub sector in factory industries, grew by 15.9 per cent in 2000 compared to 7.3 per cent in 1999. This sub sector contributed 66 per cent to the growth of output in private sector industries in 2000. The textiles sub sector grew by 13.1 per cent, while leather products grew by 7.0 per cent in 2000.

The healthy growth in the apparel sector came from the consolidation of market position in USA and the

marketing in international markets encouraged Sri Lankan

manufacturers to supply their products to reputed brand

name holders in international markets. The top 10 US

branded apparel firms visited Sri Lanka in 2000, to

establish contact with major manufacturers for future

purchases from Sri Lanka. To improve product quality and

value addition, the major apparel manufacturers commenced

a large-scale programme for upgrading technology. The

programme included automated systems for designing and

grading, embroidery, machine smocking, pleating and screen

printing. Centralised cutting plants that eliminated human

68

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

error and improved efficiency in cutting. However,

manufacturers also turned to traditional methods such as

hand smocking in view of the growing demand for those

products in the European market.- Some manufacturers

produced a host of ancillary products and services that

helped to reduce costs and ensure timely delivery of export

orders. These, together with a network of supply services,

enabled them to minimise the lead-time required to process

and execute urgent export orders, thereby successfully

integrating with the supply chain managed by major

overseas buyers.

The availability of quota to USA, the EU countries and

Canada increased by 12.2 per cent to 435.6 million pieces

in 2000. The increase was 11.3 percent in the US market,

16.1 per cent in EU countries and 19.6 per cent in Canada.

At present Sri Lanka exports 50 different apparel and textile

items under quota restrictions to those markets. The quota

availability increased by over 10 per cent in apparel

categories such as knit-shirts and blouses, shirts and blouses

not-knit, dressing gowns, underwear, terry and other pile

towels, dish towels, coats, shirts and blouses not knit and

sweaters, in the US market. However, the availability of

quota in respect of coveralls and overalls, fabric poplin/

broadcloth, pillowcases, spun cell-woven, night wear,

sweaters and dresses in the US market declined in 2000.

In the EU market, the quota availability increased over 10

per cent in respect of woven shirts and parkas, anoraks and

windcheaters in 2000. The quota availability in Canada

increased by over 15 per cent in apparel categories such

as coats, jackets and rainwear, winter outerwear, casual and

fine wear, trousers, overalls and shorts, T-shirts and athletic

wear, underwear, sleepwear and bathrobes, sweaters,

swimwear, babies' garments and bed sheets. The availability

of quota items such as coats and fine suits in the Canadian

TABLE

V a l u e o f I n d u s t r i a l

market declined by 12 per cent in 2000 owing to lower

utilisation of quota in previous years.

Sri Lanka exported about 56 per cent of its textiles and

garments to USA. This accounted for only 2.3 per cent of

the total textiles and garment imports of that country. In

2000, the total textiles and apparel exports to USA

increased by 17.1 per cent, from 560 million square meters

equivalents (SME) in 1999 to 655.5 million SME in 2000.

The corresponding increase in value terms was 14.1 per

cent which indicated a drop in prices by about 3 per cent

in 2000. This was a noteworthy development considering

the fact that Sri Lanka had to compete with countries which

received preferential tariff and market access into USA.

The average price of textiles and apparel imported from all

other countries to the US market declined by 2.3 per cent

in 2000. Apparel exports to USA increased significantly by

21.2 per cent, to 408.6 million SME in 2000. Of this, 71

per cent was exported under quota. Exports of non-quota

items registered a significant growth of 46.4 per cent, while

quota items increased by 13.3 per cent in 2000. Exports

of high value added non-quota items received relatively

higher prices in the US market in a highly competitive

market environment. Exports of other textile items to the

US market also increased, from 222.9 million SME in 1999

to 246.8 million SME in 2000, registering an increase of

10.8 per cent, and accounted for over 95 per cent of non­

quota category exports in 2000.

The rationalisation of quota allocation procedures and

the introduction of the Electronic Visa Information System

(ELVIS) in 1999, helped achieve a higher utilisation rate

of 80 per cent during the year. ELVIS replaced the existing

manual systems and improved the efficiency of quota

administration through speedy and accurate data

transmission, simplification of export documentation and

speedy import clearance process in USA. The utilisation

rate of 23 quota items in the US market exceeded 85 per

cent in 2000. The quota items in respect of dresses, knit

shirts and blouses, sweaters, trousers, pillowcases and suits

for women and girls were fully utilised in the US market

during the year. The utilisation rate was over 90 per cent

in respect of gloves, non-knit shirts, skirts, dressing gowns,

terry and other pile towels, coats and knit shirts in the US

market. In the EU market, quota utilisation rates were high

in respect of trousers for men and boys, shorts and breeches

and knitted blouses. However, as in the previous years, the

rate of quota utilisation was below 30 per cent in quota

items of suit type coats and parkas, anoraks and

windcheaters, underwear, sleepwear and bathrobes and

swimwear in 2000. The most popular quota items in the

Canadian market were winter outerwear, trousers, overalls,

shorts and baby garments. The utilisation of quota in

respect of fabric poplin/broad cloth, coats, non suits, jackets

and rainwear, T-shirts and athletic wear, dish towels and

sweaters was below 30 per cent due to the inability of

manufacturers to supply these products in the required

quality.

Further improvements in product quality, reductions in

cost and speed of delivery and shipments are essential to

face the competition in the international market for apparel.

Advanced systems that can automate complex and time

consuming tasks such as pocketing, eye buttonholing and

blanket stitching and attaching buttons are essential for cost

effective manufacture of garments of high quality. Future

competition in the international market will be increased

further by factors such as the proposed abolition of the

quota system by 2005, under the phasing out of the Multi

Fibre Agreement (MFA), growing popularity of preferential

trade, the e-commerce revolution and the emergence of low

cost manufacturers. China, with the possibility of becoming

a fully-fledged WTO member, and Mexico, with

geographical proximity to the US market and the

advantageous position conferred to it under NAFTA, will

be the major competitors for Sri Lanka's apparel exports

in the US market. The recent initiative to grant quota free

access to Sub Saharan African countries by USA and the

special bi-lateral trade agreements between USA and several

West Asian countries could erode the market share of Sri

Lanka in the US market. Domestic market constraints, such

as the non-availability of machine operators and helpers,

lack of proper training, limited domestic market for apparel

products, limited product range and sub-contracting also act

as impediments to the growth of the industry. Easy access

to changing fashion trends in Europe and USA is also

essential for product development. Therefore, a change in

marketing strategies with diversification of markets reducing

dependence on the US market, consumer oriented marketing

strategies, availability of quality fabrics in the domestic

market, skills development, market research, rapid

improvement in trading through e-commerce and image

building will be crucial factors for the development of the

apparel industry.

Under the Textile Restructuring Programme

introduced in the 1998 Budget, 111 firms submitted

modernisation proposals for up-dating technology in the

textile industry. Of them, 103 were approved by their

banks for receipt of new loans for modernisation of

factories. At end December 2000, 30 factories had

commenced implementation of re-structuring projects. The

liberalisation of textile imports in 1998, forced domestic

market oriented manufacturers to up-grade technology and

install modern machinery to face import competition.

The output of the footwear sector grew by 7.0 per cent

in 2000. The domestic oriented manufacturers were able to

consolidate their market share by introducing attractive new

designs at relatively low prices. The durability and quality

of these products have also increased substantially over the

years. However, production of export oriented footwear

registered a marginal decline due to higher competition in

international markets.

Food, beverages and tobacco

The food, beverages and tobacco category, the second

largest industrial category, grew by 6.1 per cent contributing

13 per cent to the growth of factory industries in 2000. In

this category, output of the beverages and food sub sectors

grew by 12.1 per cent and 5.1 per cent, respectively. The

liquor sub sector grew moderately by 2.1 per cent, while

the output of tobacco products declined by 2.0 per cent.

In the food sub sector, growth was higher in sub-

sectors such as processed meat, milk products, processed

fruits and vegetables, animal feed, coconut products, wheat

flour processing, processed food, biscuits, chocolates, toffee

and sweets. The domestic demand for most of these

products increased due to effective advertising and efficient

distribution methods that enhanced the popularity of these

products among the urban population. Continuous research

70

Parti

carried out by major manufacturers to assess consumer

needs helped to improve product quality. Manufacturers also

introduced a range of new products on the basis of those

research findings. These industries invested substantially in

upgrading technology and installing new machines. The

processed meat and fish product industry continued to grow

to meet rising demand, especially from the urban

population. The biscuit industry registered a 12 per cent

growth in 2000 due to increased domestic and international

demand. Domestic demand increased due to the introduction

of new products and mini packs and improvements in

packing.

The milk powder packing industry grew by 8.8 per

cent in 2000 to meet increased demand in the domestic

market. However, growth of the domestic milk powder

manufacturing industry was constrained by inadequate milk

for processing. The fruit and vegetable processing industry

registered a 6.1 per cent growth in 2000. The processing

of cashew, pineapple and mango has high growth potential

in international markets. In addition to the processing of

cashew nuts, the shell is used as a raw material for

producing items such as alcohol, brake lining, lacquer,

paints and antibacterial and anti-fungal products. The fibre

of the pineapple leaf is used for manufacturing high priced

clothing material. However, the commercial cultivation of

fruit for such industries is constrained by the non­

availability of large extents of land, insufficient storage and

transport facilities, non-availability of high quality seeds and

low productivity. The demand for poultry feed increased

owing to the increased rearing of chicken during the year.

The demand for chicken, as a preferred source of protein

by the public, has increased gradually, with prices

favourable compared to those of other products. Domestic

demand for coconut milk powder grew due to aggressive

advertising and reduced prices following low input prices.

The convenience of using dried coconut milk powder has

stimulated demand.

The soft drink industry recovered well and grew by 12.1 per cent in 2000 as against the 2.2 per cent decline experienced in 1999. Effective marketing and distribution efforts and the introduction of new products, coupled with the dry weather conditions that prevailed in certain parts of the country during the year, boosted the demand for soft drinks. The processed and packeted tea industry showed an improvement with increased demand for these products from EU, Russia, and West Asian countries.

The output of liquor spirits rose by 6.5 per cent growth

in 2000, due to increased demand and a reduction of illicit

liquor production as a result of the strict enforcement of

excise laws. The major manufacturers introduced new

shapes of bottles, new labelling and new bottle caps to

attract consumers and to prevent counterfeiting. After

several years of continuous growth, the beer industry grew

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

only marginally in 2000, mainly due to the reduction of

demand in response to a price increase as a result of a rise

in excise duty. During the year, some beer manufacturers

improved bottling by introducing canned beer to the

domestic market, which was well received by the consumers

because of easy disposability, storage, and the elimination

of the risks of breaking and spilling.

The output of processed tobacco products declined by

2 per cent in 2000 despite various promotional activities.

The excise driven price increases and the anti-tobacco

campaign reduced the demand for cigarettes. The export of

cigarettes to West Asia has also declined due to high excise

duty on tobacco imports imposed by those countries.

However, the processed tobacco manufacturing BOI firms

showed higher performance during the year. In order to

popularise the image of specific brands among the market

segment of the affluent and urban adult consumers,

manufacturers launched various promotional campaigns to

introduce new brands with attractive designs in packing that

met international standards. The effective enforcement of

customs laws substantially reduced smuggling of cigarettes

into the country during the year.

Chemicals, petroleum, rubber and plastic products

The output of the chemicals, petroleum, rubber and plastic

product category, the third largest category in private sector

industries, grew by 9.1 per cent compared to 4.5 per cent

in 1999. This category contributed 13 per cent to the

growth in private sector industries in 2000. In this category

the major sub-sectors that showed significant growth were

rubber based industries (12.1 per cent), chemicals, paints

and fertiliser (13.1 per cent), pharmaceuticals, detergents

and other products (6.0 per cent) and plastic and PVC

products (6.5 per cent).

The rubber-based industry regained its competitiveness

with the appreciation of East Asian currencies, lower cost

of production and improvements in product quality. A

noteworthy increase in export orders was registered for

rubber gloves and industrial and agricultural tyres from

USA, Europe and the West Asia. The market share for

locally produced bicycle and commercial vehicle tyres

increased despite the availability of various brand of

imported tyres. During the year, manufacturers introduced

new high quality tyres for trucks, prime movers and trailers

used for heavy load transportation. There was an increased

demand for bicycle tyres and tubes, especially from the

rural areas. The export of rubber-based products such as

resin rubber shoes and soling sheets to India took place

under the concessions offered in the Indo-Lanka Free Trade

Agreement.

In the chemicals, paints and fertiliser subsector, the

high growth industries were fertiliser mixing, activated

carbon, mosquito coils, chemicals, weedicides and

7 1

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

insecticides. Fertiliser production benefited from increased

use of fertiliser in the tea sector. Technical and extension

services offered by major manufacturers, better crop prices

and favourable weather helped stimulate the demand for

fertiliser. For the first time, mosquito coils manufactured in

Sri Lanka received large export orders from Pakistan, South

Africa and Kenya. The domestic demand for mosquito coils

also increased substantially during the year. The activated

carbon industry recovered significantly with increased

export orders received from USA. Increased coconut

production and improvements in the desiccated coconut

industry resulted in an increased supply of coconut shells

used in the activated carbon industry. The cost of

production in this industry also decreased with the

introduction of steam turbines, which utilise waste. The

soap and detergent industry performed well due to

continuous improvement in product quality, aggressive

promotional campaigns and relative price advantage over

imported items. Market segmentation through introduction

of mini-packs with special prices increased the demand for

tooth paste, shampoo and perfumes, especially among low-

income consumers. The growing popularity of herbal

products, coupled with improvements in product quality and

packaging, stimulated the demand for domestic aryurvedic

products. The industry was able to withstand the pressures

of imports from India. In 2000, aryurvedic products were

exported to markets in USA and East Asian countries.

However, the quality of products can be further improved

through research and product development to meet the

requirements of Western markets.

The plastics industry grew by 6.5 per cent in 2000.

The increasing trend to substitute plastics for wood products

such as furniture, household items, building materials and

packing materials continued in 2000. The completion of

major telecommunication projects in the country reduced the

demand for PVC pipes. BOI industries manufacturing lamps

and plastic components, camping tents, travelling bags and

haversacks, PVC rain wear and bags and plastic headers

registered relatively high growth during the year.

Non-metallic mineral products

This category registered a marginal growth of 2.6 per cent,

reflecting slower growth in the industrial items of ceramic

products, cement and processed diamonds. The sub-category

of building materials grew by 4.2 per cent in 2000.

Reduction in demand for ceramic tiles from East Asian

countries, affected by the slowing down in the construction

industry following the financial crisis in those countries, has

not reversed fully to its pre-recession level. However,

demand for ceramic products from UK, USA, Canada and

Australia increased substantially during the year. Some

exporters found high value added niche markets in the

Netherlands and Belgium. The ceramic tile industry invested

a significant amount of funds to improve product quality,

human resources and adopt modern technology. The

domestic demand for wall and floor tiles continued to

increase with the growing popularity of ceramic tiles in the

construction industry. Glazed porcelain tiles, which are

stronger than traditional ceramic tiles and more suitable for

domestic and industrial applications, are becoming popular

among consumers. Some of the exclusive designs

manufactured especially for export markets were

successfully introduced to the domestic market during the

year. There is high potential for the ceramic industry to

expand its share in the Indian market, as they do not

manufacture porcelain products on a large scale.

The output of cement grew only marginally in the face

of competition from imports. To protect the domestic

cement manufacturing industry, the import duty on cement

was increased from 10 per cent to 25 per cent in June

2000. However, the import duty on cement imported from

India remained at 9.5 per cent under the Indo-Lanka Free

Trade Agreement.

The growth in the construction industry stimulated by

tax concessions and availability of loan financing, created

a higher demand for building materials such as asbestos,

concrete products, roofing sheets and glass. Production of

asbestos, roofing and ceiling sheets grew at 14 per cent in

2000. The glass industry has invested significantly to

improve efficiency in production and has taken measures

to improve quality.

Fabricated metal products

The output of fabricated metal products grew by 4.5 per

cent in 2000 compared to 5.4 per cent growth achieved in

1999. This category contributed 2.1 per cent to the growth

of factory industries in 2000. The sub-categories that

contributed to the growth are refrigerators, electrical items,

kitchen appliances, television sets, agricultural machinery,

fabrication of motor coaches, manufacturing and repairing

of ships and boats, aluminium products, cables,

transformers, and light fittings.

The expansion of rural electrification and the

improvement of rural income boosted the demand for

television sets, electrical items and kitchen appliances. The

expansion of agricultural activities also created a greater

demand for agricultural machinery such as water pumps and

sprayers. The manufacturers of refrigerators introduced new

models with modern features improving quality and new

designs keeping with market trends. The demand for deep-

freezers has increased with the expansion of trade outlets

that sell frozen foods in rural areas. The expansion of the

soft drinks industry and the growing popularity of food

outlets, in both urban and rural areas, stimulated the

demand for bottle coolers. The output of electronic parts,

ferrite cores, computer parts and transformers manufactured

by BOI firms grew due to higher international demand.

72

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

The fabrication of motor coaches registered a higher

growth in 2000 with an increased number of orders placed

by the regional bus companies and the private sector. The

boat and ship building industry also grew with an increased

number of orders received from the government and from

neighbouring countries. The continuous improvement in

product quality helped the electric cables and light fitting

industry to attract higher demand from the growing

construction industry. Exports of used scrap bronze,

aluminium, nickel, lead, and zinc metal caused a raw

material shortage for the local welding industry. Hence, the

government imposed an export duty of 25 per cent on

exports of those scrap materials.

Paper and paper products

The paper and paper products industry grew by 7.7 per

cent in 2000. Items that performed well in this category

were newspapers, books and magazines, corrugated cartons,

packing materials, labels, posters, exercise books and

diaries. In 2000, technology in the paper industry improved

significantly and new machinery was added. The printing

of newspapers increased by 6 per cent during the year.

Several magazines and tabloids, especially in fields such as

sports, politics, the English language, business and leisure

activities, were introduced during the year. The export-

oriented manufacturers showed a tendency to use

domestically manufactured corrugated cartons, labels and

paper boxes for packing. The output of products such as

photo albums, books and periodicals and paper sacks

manufactured by BOI firms, registered a higher growth

during the year.

Wood and wood products

The domestic demand for wood based furniture and other

items was sluggish due to the growing trend of utilising

steel and plastic furniture in place of Wood products. The

availability of imported furniture also reduced the demand

for domestically manufactured furniture. The industry

suffered from the lack of raw materials and skilled labour.

a better performance especially in the case of sports and

allied goods, wooden educational items, wooden toys,

handicrafts and gift items manufactured by BOI firms.

Several major manufacturers modernised their technology by

installing new machines to replace most manual work in the

wood manufacturing industry.

Public Sector Industries

The output of public sector industries increased by 24 per

cent in 2000 in real terms, as compared to a drop of 12

per cent in 1999. The output of the Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation, which accounts for over 90 per cent of the

public sector industrial output, increased by 24 per cent in

2000. Uninterrupted production at the Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation throughout the year (unlike in 1999 when the

refinery was closed for about two months in the early part

. of the year for routine maintenance) was the primary reason

for the substantial increase in the output of public sector

industries. Public sector industrial output, excluding

petroleum products, increased by about 21 per cent.

The output of the State Timber Corporation increased

by 68 per cent in 2000, mainly due to an increased level

of felling that resulted from the allocation of a large extent

of forest areas for felling operations by the Forest

Department and leasing out of more private sector forest

plantations for felling operations. The output of Sevanagala

Sugar Industries Ltd. increased by 46 per cent in 2000* with

the availability of good quality sugarcane. The output of

Lanka Phosphates Ltd. grew by 16 per cent to meet higher

demand for fertiliser. Sri Lanka Rubber Manufacturing and

Exports Corporation Ltd. ceased the production of pale

crepe in the latter part of 1999 and converted some of its

factories to facilitate the production of final consumer goods

such as moulded products, bicycle tyres and tubes and

three-wheeler tyres for the export market. One of these

factories commenced commercial production in January

2000, and the rest have now commenced trial production.

Rainy weather conditions that prevailed in major salt

manufacturing areas during the second half of the year

adversely affected salt production in 2000. As a result, the

output of Lanka Salt Ltd. declined by 25 per cent during

the year. The output of the National Paper Company Ltd.

continued to decline in the face Of intense competition from

imported paper and the lack of raw materials. The

Valaichchcnai paper mill, which uses waste paper as its

main raw material, is flow faced With a problem of 8

shortage of raw materials, with increased exports of waste

paper to India.

the year. Value added, as a ratio of total value of

production, increased marginally from 36 per cent in 1999

to 36.2 per cent in 2000. The improvement of the total

productivity in the industrial sector with the introduction of

modern technology and various measures adopted by

manufacturers, such as the efficient utilisation of raw

materials, reduction of waste and re-use of waste materials

and energy-saving methods for cost reduction, had a

beneficial effect on value addition. However, the increase

in the cost of imported raw materials and power and fuel,

particularly during the latter part of the year, reduced

potential growth of value addition to some extent. The

value added ratios in 2000 increased in the industrial

categories of textiles, wearing apparel and leather products;

chemicals, rubber and plastic products and non-metallic

mineral products. Reductions in value added ratios were

observed in the industrial categories of food, beverages and

tobacco; fabricated metal products, paper and paper products

and wood products. The value added ratios were above 45

per cent in the industrial categories of food, beverages and

tobacco products; wood and wood products; non-metallic

mineral products and fabricated metal products. The value

added ratio in the textiles, wearing apparel and leather

product category increased from 30.9 per cent in 1999 to

32.2 per cent in 2000. The lowest value added ratio of 23.8

per cent was in the industrial category of chemicals, rubber

and plastic products.

The installed capacity of non-BOI industries increased further by 4.6 per cent in 2000, facilitated by the fiscal incentives offered under the Advanced Technology Incentive Scheme, Textile Restructuring Programme and lower National Security Levy for the importation of machinery. Better prices received for exported items, growing markets and the relatively lower interest rates that prevailed in the first half of the year also helped expand the existing capacity. Capacity expansion was relatively high in the industrial categories of food, beverages and tobacco, (3.9 per cent), textiles, wearing apparel and leather products (5.8 per cent), paper and paper products (4.8 per cent) and fabricated metal products (4.2 per cent). Overall capacity utilisation in the industrial sector increased from 83 per cent in 1999 to 85 per cent in 2000.

4.4 Cost of Production, Profitability and Employment.

The average ex-factory profit ratio (profit/ex-factory value

of production) of non-BOI firms increased from 12.2 per

cent in 1999 to 13.7 per cent in 2000. Profitability was

estimated using data from 480 firms surveyed in 2000. The

factors that helped improve profitability were waste

reduction, better management of working capital, energy

saving, optimal use of raw materials and outsourcing of

production by manufacturers. Effective pricing policies and

improvement in prices in international markets gave a

further boost to improve profitability. This was achieved

amidst increases in the cost of imported materials, fuel,

electricity, gas and telephone bills in the second half of the

year. Increases in the cost of production were significant

in milk products, chemicals and fertiliser and paper and

paper products due to the increase in raw material prices

in international markets and depreciation of the Sri Lankan

rupee by 9.9 per cent in 2000. Profitability in the non-BOI

industrial sector ranged from 19.8 per cent in the textiles,

wearing apparel and leather product category to 10.2 per

cent in the basic metal product category. Profitability in the

industrial sub-sectors of soap and detergents, food, apparel,

fabricated metal export oriented electronic items, rubber

based industries, ayurvedic drugs, food and tea processing

and tobacco processing increased significantly during the

year.

The wage bill in the industrial sector, in absolute

terms, increased by 10.9 per cent in 2000 reflecting a 6.6

per cent growth in output, a 2.9 per cent growth in the

labour force and a 3.6 per cent growth in labour

productivity. The share of the wage bill in the total cost

of production increased marginally from 12.2 per cent in

1999 to 12.4 per cent in 2000. The wage bill, as a

percentage of the total cost of production, increased in the

industrial categories of textiles, wearing apparel and leather

products, chemicals, rubber and plastic products and paper

and paper products, reflecting an increase in the labour

force and higher production. A decline in the wage share

was observed in the industrial categories of fabricated metal

and non-metallic mineral products. The share of labour

costs was over 15 per cent in the industrial categories of

textiles, wearing apparel and leather products, wood and

wood products and non-metallic mineral products. The

labour cost was relatively low in the industrial categories

of food, beverages and tobacco and fabricated metal

products. The relatively low inflation rate that prevailed

during the first half of the year reduced the pressure for

salary increases and thereby contained any excessive growth

in the wage bill. Many companies adopted a strategy of out­

sourcing production to reduce the total wage bill of the

company. The stringent labour laws and seasonal production

requirements encouraged manufacturers to recruit contract

and casual labour, further reducing the upward pressure on

the wage bill.

The total energy cost in the non-BOI industrial

sector, in absolute terms, increased by 16.1 per cent in

2000. Energy costs as a percentage of the total cost of

production, increased to 4.9 per cent in 2000 compared to

4.5 per cent in the previous year. The increased utilisation

of electricity with the expansion of capacity utilisation and

the upward adjustment of electricity, gas and petroleum

prices were responsible for the increase in energy costs in

2000. The share of electricity costs in the total cost of

production increased in many industrial categories in 2000.

The share of energy costs in the total cost of production

in the non-metallic mineral product category increased from

15.8 per cent in 1999 to 17.1 per cent due to the increase

in the prices of furnace oil, gas and electricity. Energy costs

represent a significant proportion of the total cost of

production in cement and ceramic industries. The share of

energy costs is low in the industrial categories of food,

beverages and tobacco and paper and paper products.

Interest cost, as a percentage of the total cost of production,

declined to 2.7 per cent in 2000 from 2.9 per cent in the

previous year. Reduced short-term borrowings from banks

as a result of the efficient management of working capital,

improved cash flows in many companies and relatively

lower interest rates that prevailed during the first half of

2000, reduced the total interest cost in the industrial sector.

The reduction of interest cost was prominent in the

industrial categories of wood and wood products; non-

metallic mineral products; textiles wearing apparel and

leather products; paper and paper products; chemicals,

rubber and plastic products and fabricated metal products.

Labour Productivity in Industry

Labour productivity, estimated on the basis of the change in the real value added per man hour in the 480 non-BOI enterprises, increased by 3.6 per cent in 2000. Growth of labour productivity in the previous year was 1.9 per cent. The improvement of labour productivity was seen in many industrial categories. Labour productivity improved significantly in the industrial categories of food, beverages and tobacco (4.0 per cent); textiles, wearing apparel and leather (3.1 per cent); chemicals, rubber and plastic (6.7 per cent) and fabricated metal (4.4 per cent). The installation of automated systems and the adoption of modern technology in recent years helped improve labour productivity through reduction of human error, lower wastage and improvement of personal motivation. The adoption of better management techniques, training in skills development and a reduction of excess labour also contributed to the improvement of labour productivity. Improvements in the working environment in factories and welfare facilities such as free medical care, meals and transport facilities, especially in the apparel, food, beverages and tobacco industries had beneficial effects on the improvement of labour productivity.

Employment

Employment in the industrial sector increased by 9.9 per

cent in 2000 reflecting the creation of more employment

opportunities mainly in the export oriented BOI industries.

Employment in BOI and non-BOI industries rose by 12.5

per cent and 2.9 per cent, respectively, during the year.

BOI industries created 40,790 new employment

opportunities in 2000. The textiles, apparel and leather

product category alone created 25,735 employment

opportunities, while chemical, rubber and plastic industries

created 5,441 new employment opportunities during the

year. New factories established under the Fifty-Garment

Factory Programme, Mini Export Processing Zones and

Industrial Parks/Estates programmes created most of these

employment opportunities. The apparel manufacturers in the

export processing zones and urban areas were not able to

fill all the vacancies in their factories due to the lack of

skilled and non-skilled labour.

Employment creation in the non-BOI sector was higher

in the industrial categories of textiles, wearing apparel and

leather products; wood and wood products and fabricated

metal products. Employment in the apparel industries

increased by 4.8 per cent reflecting the expansion of

capacity and capacity utilisation. In the chemicals, rubber

and plastic product category, more employment

opportunities were created in fertiliser mixing plants,

plastics, chemicals and rubber product industries. The

growth of employment by 7.6 per cent in the fabricated

metal products industry was marked by the higher

absorption of labour in industries in the sub sectors of

fabrication of bus bodies, electrical cables and electrical

machinery. Employment in the food, beverages and tobacco

category declined marginally due to the voluntary retirement

scheme introduced by a major manufacturer in the tobacco

and beverage industry. The modernisation of factories with

automated systems in the food processing industry also

contributed to reduce labour requirements during the year.

A marginal decline in employment in the fruit processing

and sugar manufacturing industry was seen in 2000.

4.5 Investment

Foreign Investment

Foreign investment inflows to Sri Lanka declined in 2000,

despite intensive promotional campaigns undertaken by

BOI. The main reason for the decline in investment may

be deteriorating investor confidence owing to several war-

related incidents in 2000. With the declaration of a ' war

footing' condition in Sri Lanka in 2000, investors may have

adopted a 'wait and see' approach by withholding

77

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

investment projects. The uncertainty created by the general

election also contributed to the lower investment flows in

2000.

The realised investment of BOI industries in 2000,

declined by 35 per cent, from Rs. 28,814 million in 1999

to Rs. 18,709 million in 2000. Investment commitments in

the approved and contracted projects also declined in 2000.

BOI, which functions as the main government agency for

the promotion of foreign investments, made substantial

efforts to attract investment. It organised several investment

promotion missions to USA, India, UK, Sweden, Norway

and France in 2000. Several foreign delegations also visited

Sri Lanka in 2000 in search of new investment

opportunities. These delegations included a 12-member

delegation from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in

UK, a 10-member delegation from the Trade Development

Board in Singapore and a delegation from the Leicestershire

Chamber of Commerce, UK. A large number of delegations

from reputed companies in UK, Belgium, Spain, France,

Italy and India also visited Sri Lanka in 2000 to study the

possibilities of commencing various investment projects in

Sri Lanka.

Chart 4.7 Realised Investment of the BOI

1996 1997 1998 1999 2000

New investments in 2000 included, Rayon of India

with an envisaged investment of Rs.1,515 million, a metal

recycling project with an envisaged investment of Rs.53

million a steel tank project with an envisaged investment

Rs.22 million and a new air cargo project of Bidport

Aviation of UK with an envisaged investment of Rs.758

million. Several large-scale projects commenced

construction work on their factories. These projects included

AES Kelanitissa (Pvt.) Ltd. with an investment commitment

of Rs.7.480 million, Linea Intimo (Pvt.) Ltd. with an

investment commitment of Rs.5,224, Nivasi Developers

(Pvt.) Ltd. with an investment commitment of Rs.2,056

million, TSG Lanka Ltd. with an investment commitment

of Rs.6,317 million and Textured Jersey Lanka (Pvt) Ltd.

with an investment commitment of Rs.3,010 million.

The number of projects approved by BOI and

investment commitments of these projects declined in 2000

compared to the previous year. BOI approved 329 new

investment projects in 2000, with investment commitments

of Rs.87,992 million under Section 17 of the BOI Law,

compared to 350 projects with investment commitment of

Rs. 104,851 million approved in 1999. The total number of

projects approved was 3,332 as at end 2000. The foreign

component of approved investments in 2000 was Rs.23,478

million or 27 per cent of the total approved investment. Of

the approved projects in 2000, 59 were entirely foreign

owned, 111 were joint venture collaborations and 159 were

entirely domestic owned ventures. The expected

employment generated by these projects was estimated at

59,375 persons. A category wise breakdown of approved

projects in 2000 reveals that 70 projects were in the textiles,

apparel and leather product category, 17 in the food,

beverages and tobacco category and 15 in the chemical,

petroleum, rubber and plastics category. The number of

projects approved in the service sector was 173, a majority

of which were software development projects. This could

be attributed to the recognition of IT as a priority sector

by government and the attractive incentives granted in the

budget proposals both in 1999 and 2000.

Investment in contracted projects also declined in 2000.

During the year, BOI signed agreements in respect of 201

projects with investment commitments of Rs.44,962 million

compared to 205 projects with investment commitment of

Rs.62,085 million in 1999. The total number of contracted

projects, as at end 2000 was 2,088. The foreign component

of the contracted investment was Rs. 16,779 million or 37

per cent of the total investment of contracted projects. The

employment generation capacity of these projects was

estimated at 43,267 persons. The major industrial categories

that would absorb these investments are textiles, wearing

apparel and leather products; chemical, petroleum, rubber

and plastic products and the service sector. Of the total

contracted projects up to end 2000, 1,227 projects with an

investment commitment of Rs.188,927 million were in

commercial operation. The foreign investment commitment

of these projects was Rs. 108,314 million or 57 per cent of

the total investment in projects in commercial operation.

The employment generation capacity of these projects was

estimated at 332,844 persons. The majority of these projects

were in textiles, wearing apparel and leather products (255

projects), food, beverages and tobacco products (130

projects) and chemical, rubber and plastic products (115

projects). There were 415 projects in the service sector

including power, telecommunications, trading houses and

software development projects. There were 96 enterprises

located in the Katunayake Export Processing Zone (EPZ),

4.6 Availability of Credit to the Industrial Sector

The industrial sector continues to receive credit facilities

from commercial banks and development banks to meet

working capital requirements as well as medium and long-

term investment requirements. Commercial banks mainly

provided short and medium-term credit facilities, while

development banks provided medium and long-term credit

facilities in the form of direct loans, equity participation and

credit facilities under sector specific credit programmes.

During the year, credit extended by commercial banks to

the industrial sector increased substantially. However, long

and medium-term credit granted by development banks

decreased significantly mainly due to the exhaustion of

funds obtained from international agencies in the previous

years to finance micro, small and medium scale industrial

projects. Major development banks such as National

Development Bank (NDB) and DFCC Bank continued to

provide long and medium-term financial facilities to the

industrial sector. NDB continued to provide refinance under

sector specific credit projects such as the Small and

Medium Enterprises Assistance Project (SMAP) and the

Small and Micro Industries Leader and Entrepreneur

Promotion Projects (SMILE). However, the amount of credit

approved under these credit projects declined substantially

in 2000. The interest rates on loans, which were relatively

low in the early part of the year, rose in the fourth quarter

of the year, thus increasing the cost of funds.

According to the Quarterly Survey of Commercial

Banks' Advances and Deposits conducted by the Central

Bank of Sri Lanka, commercial bank credit to the industrial

sector during the first nine months of 2000, increased

substantially to Rs.27.4 billion from Rs.21.9 billion in 1999.

NDB approved direct financing amounting to Rs.5,604

million for 1,116 projects in 2000, compared to Rs.8,103

million approved for 1,201 projects in 1999. Textiles,

wearing apparel and leather product category and chemical,

petroleum, rubber and plastic products category absorbed a

major portion of this credit facility. NDB also approved

refinance amounting to Rs.18 million in 2000 under the

SMAP and SMILE programmes in respect of 118 projects,

as against Rs.2,557 million approved in 1999 in respect of

3,292 projects.

DFCC Bank approved financial facilities amounting to

Rs.4,123 million in respect of 303 industrial projects in

2000, as compared to Rs.4,638 million in respect of 773

projects approved in 1999. These financial facilities

consisted of Rs.3,623 'million loan financing and Rs.500

million equity financing. Equity finance was given to a

single project in the fabricated metal product category. Of

the credit facilities approved under the direct loan scheme,

Rs.965 million was approved in respect of 91 projects in

the food, beverages and tobacco products, Rs.741 million

in respect of 44 projects in textiles, wearing apparel and

leather products and Rs.725 million in respect of 33

projects in chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products

categories.

4.7 Industrial Policy

The industrial policy of the government assigns a greater

role to the private sector to achieve rapid and sustainable

industrial development in the country within the framework

of a n export-oriented industrialisation strategy. The main

objectives of the industrial policy are expansion,

diversification a n d upgrading of both the industrial base and

the export base; efficient management of physical and

manpower resources; employment and income generation in

both rural and urban areas; export orientation; regional

industrialisation and fostering environment friendly and

sustainable industrial development. In order to achieve these

objectives, the government has offered a wide range of

incentives to encourage both J o c a l and foreign investments

in specific industrial sub sectors. These incentives include

tax concessions, tax holidays, tariff concessions a n d duty

free imports of machinery, equipment and raw materials. In

addition, the government introduced several other measures

including a National Productivity Decade Programme,

Advanced Technology Incentive Programme and Textile

Restructuring Programme aimed at enhancing industrial

sector productivity and global competitiveness of industrial

exports.

Although these measures contributed to the

development of the industrial sector, the export structure is

still dependent on a few industrial products, particularly

textiles and apparel. In order to increase the diversification

of the industrial export structure with a view to reducing

high dependence o n a few products and promote industries

in a selective and strategic manner, the government

formulated a Master Plan for Industrialisation and

Investment Promotion also known as the Rainbow Plan in

collaboration with JICA and UNIDO, covering the ten year

period 2000-2010. The main objective of this plan is to

shift from labour intensive industries to knowledge based

and technology-intensive industries in the coming decade.

This plan identified key industries such as apparel, leather,

rubber, plastics, machinery, electric/electronics and

information technology as priority industries to be promoted

in a selective and strategic manner. The time period of the

plan is divided i n t o two stages, i.e., from 2000-2004 and

2005-2010. The first half of the plan period is designated

as a consolidation period, while the second half will be a

period for acceleration of the industries. According to the

Master Plan, the manufacturing sector is targeted to grow

at 10-11 per cent per annum during 2000-2010. The Master

Plan has given high priority to develop small and medium

scale industries by setting up a new organisation known as

the Small and Medium Scale Enterprise Development

Corporation (SEMEDEC). This organisation is expected to

provide technical/management advice for technological

upgrading of SMIs, management and information services,

and venture a n d incubation promotion to support new

venture industries a n d a credit guarantee organisations to

facilitate fund flows to SMIs.

With a view to attracting more foreign investment to

the industrial sector a n d aiming at diversification and

8 1

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

expansion of export structures, through the promotion of

Sri Lanka as an export platform to Indian markets and also

providing local manufacturers with a wider market in the

region, the government signed the Indo-Lanka Free Trade

Agreement (ILFTA) on 28 December 1998. The agreement

came into force on 1 March 2000. The ILFTA provides

market access to Sri Lankan products in India, while

allowing duty free imports of raw materials and machinery

from India. Under this agreement, India will gradually

remove its custom tariffs over a period of three years,

subject to a negative list, which contains 429 items. In

return, Sri Lanka will remove tariffs on imports from India

over a period of eight years, subject to a negative list

containing 1,180 items. The inclusion of products in the

negative list is to provide protection to local industries.

Although garments remain in the negative list of India, a

50 per cent tariff concession has been given on a fixed

basis by India, subject to an annual quota of 8 million

pieces, of which 6 million pieces should be produced only

of Indian fabrics, provided that no single category of

garments, exceeds 1.5 million pieces per annum. The Board

of Investment has decided not to extend import duty

concession for items in the negative list under the ILFTA

in order to provide protection to local industries producing

such items. Duty free imports of such items will be

permitted only in cases where an item cannot be

manufactured in Sri Lanka to the required quality standard,

on a time bound basis.

As availability and quality of infrastructure facilities is one of the key factors that determine investment flows to the industrial sector, the government continues to embark on development of infrastructure facilities, while encouraging private sector participation on a BOO/BOT basis. Those infrastructure facilities include power generation, telecommunications, port development, highways, industrial parks/estates, industrial townships and skill development. As information technology has been identified as one of the thrust areas for industrial development, special incentives were introduced in the Budget 2000 to encourage the establishment of 50 training institutes in major population centres covering all districts. These institutes will be linked to proposed IT parks at Malabe, Kesbewa and Pugoda. The initial expenditure on setting up such facilities, including the cost of training, renovating and refurbishing premises and setting up infrastructure facilities will be met by BOI. A five year tax holiday is available for such institutes, if they locate outside the Colombo District, and have a capacity to train a minimum of 300 persons per year. As there exists considerable potential for local manufacture of non-combat military items such as belts, boots, uniforms, tents etc., for the use of the armed forces, the police, prisons and for export, the Budget 2000 proposed to establish a separate

zone for this purpose. This zone will attract investors who

will produce both for the local and the export market.

The Government of Sri Lanka and the European

Commission signed a Memorandum of Understanding

(MOU) on 5 December 2000 for quota free apparel and

textile trade in EU countries. This agreement will suspend

all quantitative restrictions on Sri Lankan exports of textiles

and apparel to the European Union with effect from 1

January 2001, four years ahead of the scheduled complete

removal of quota restrictions on world textiles and apparel

exports. Prior to the signing of this MOU, apparel exports

to EU, such as mens' and boys' woven breeches, shorts,

trousers and shirts, womens' and girls' woven trousers,

slacks, blouses and shorts, parkas, anoraks, windcheaters,

waist jackets were under quota restrictions. The exhaustion

of quotas in respect of certain categories led EU buyers to

place their orders with manufacturers in other countries.

Since this MOU suspends all quota restrictions, apparel

exports to EU are estimated to grow significantly in 2001.

In addition, this MOU is expected to facilitate the inflow

of more foreign investment and new technology to the

textiles and apparel industry.

Incentives to the Industrial Sector

As there were anomalies in BOI incentives, the Budget

2000 proposed to correct those anomalies with a view to

rationalising BOI incentives and ensuring that incentives

were offered only for priority sector investment activities.

Non-export oriented BOI enterprises, which signed

agreements with BOI prior to 1994, were exempt from

customs duty on project related capital goods imports, for

an indefinite period. However, the current practice is that

such exemptions are available until the commencement of

commercial operations of the enterprises. Hence, the Budget

2000 proposed to withdraw the exemption given for an

indefinite period to non-export oriented enterprises, with

effect from 1 April 2001.

Budget 2000 also proposed to impose minimum investment limits on all incentive categories given under Section 17 of the BOI Law in order to ensure that incentives are given only for priority sector investments. An incentive package was introduced in the 1998 Budget including a tax holiday of 5 years and 8 years to promote geographical dispersion of industries. It has now been proposed to limit tax holidays only to enterprises locating within designated industrial parks or Export Processing Zones classified as 'preferred' or 'most preferred'. A 10 year tax holiday given under the 1996 Budget proposal to large scale projects that invest a minimum of Rs.500 million irrespective of export orientation, has now been replaced with a concessionary tax rate of 15 per cent for non-export oriented projects under the 2000 Budget proposals. Non-export oriented projects with a total

Box 6 Guidelines for an Effective Industrial Policy

Introduction *

Industry, being an important sector in our economy,

needs to be promoted through a set of conscious

policies. This was first recognised by the Japanese

government which launched a series of policies for the

promotion of industrial development (Inoue, 1993).1

Due to the remarkable growth, achieved by the

Japanese industry in the 1960s and the 1970s, the

concept gained international attention. Based on the

Japanese experience, industrial policy was successfully

adopted in East Asia from the 1960s, with periodical

revision of the policy in line with the changing global

economic environment. In many developed countries in

the OECD group (Organisation for Economic Co­

operation and Development), industrial policy began to

be seriously integrated into economic policy in the

post-war era, as evidenced from the policy debates that

took place in Europe and USA in the 1970s. *r* \;

World experience has shown that active support to

selected industry by the government has been of limited

success. Instead, it is the overall industry facilitation by

the government that has promoted industry on a

sustainable basis. These measures include economic

liberalisation, research and development, skills and

human capital development that contribute to raising

competitiveness of a country's industrial products. >

New Dimensions in Industrial Policy

In the past, many countries pursued policies to expand industrial production in specific sectors to foster national or regional economic development, expand or protect employment, improve the balance of payments or stimulate domestic technological innovation. During the extended period of low economic growth that began in the mid-1970s in most developed countries, the traditional national industrial policies became less effective. Enterprises began to adopt alternative policies and global strategies and their investments flew to places where they found attractive market opportunities and favourable inputs such as skilled labour, efficient infrastructure and favourable regulatory reginies. The liberalisation of trade and investment across the world made markets more open to both internal and external competition. The policies based on notions such as

1 Inoue, Ryuichiro 1993, An East Asian Industrial Policy Model in Industrial Policy in East Asia, eds. Hirohisa Kohama and Shujiro Urata, Japan External Trade Organisation, Tokyo, Japan.

'government knows best' became too costly and

unsustainable as government budgets were squeezed. By

and large, it became apparent that governments were not

good at 'picking winners' and were operating in an

environment, of liquidity constraints. As a result,

attention has now shifted towards policies that improve

the business environment while removing impediments

to trade and investment.

The focus of industrial support has also changed,

with sectoral support giving way to economy-wide

measures, such as support for research and development,

infrastructure development, environmental protection and

start-up and growth of new businesses. Subsidies and

industrial support increasingly targeted investment and

acquiring skills and knowledge. Under competitive

pressure, successful firms had withdrawn from activities

in which they were less competent and had focussed,

instead, on their 'core capabilities'. They collaborated

with other firms on product development, production,

purchasing and marketing, and purchased a growing

range of business services from outside suppliers. In

order to ensure the smooth flow of crucial information

within the firm as well as with outside partners and

subcontractors, firms have shown a tendency to relying

increasingly on knowledge based information networks.

» Small and Medium Enterprises (SME), which have

a number of advantages, particularly in developing

countries, are facing typical problems such as a lack of

economies of scale, a small domestic market, insufficient

management depth and professionalism, weak

entrepreneurial culture and insufficient exploitation of

technology. To counter such problems, competitive

countries like Singapore have adopted special policy

measures.2 The lack of economies of scale is remedied

by helping SMEs to form economic groupings,

developing electronic data interchange systems to link

them with other members of the value chain and

assisting them to establish high standards and

productivity. The problem of a small domestic market

is resolved by encouraging SMEs to enter into business

partnerships with foreign partners and other multinational

firms, go for brand enhancements and negotiate for

greater market access. Special programmes are offered

to overcome management deficiencies and improve

professionalism. Measures such as developing business

incubator systems and upgrading secondary and tertiary

education curricula are adopted for developing a

favorable entrepreneurial culture.

Sri Lanka's Experience

The focus of Sri Lanka's industrial policy since

independence has varied according to the socio-political

and economic ideology of successive governments and

changes in the international economic environment.

There was a major shift in industrial policy when the

State Industrial Corporation Act No. 48 was enacted in

1957. This Act empowered the government to set up and

carry out any industrial undertaking under state

ownership. During the 1960-65 period, the emphasis of

the industrial policy was placed on import substitution

industrialisation in the face of declining foreign reserves.

However, the government that came into power in 1965,

placed greater emphasis on export promoting industries

within the framework of a general import substitution

industrialisation.

The industrial policy of the government in the

1970s relied heavily on state sector led development

through promotion of import substitution industries.

During this period, government intervention and direct

state participation in industry increased substantially. The

government also nationalised several private enterprises

under the Business Undertaking (Acquisition) Act of

1970. The emphasis on import substitution strategies

and greater government involvement in industrial

activities gradually intensified during 1970-1977.

Under the economic policy reforms initiated in 1977, there was a complete turn-around in economic policy, focusing mainly on the export market and relying more on the private sector. The degree of tariff protection offered to local industries was reduced, gradually exposing them to international competition. The simplification of the tariff system, unification of the exchange rate, abolition of many foreign exchange restrictions and opening of sectors hitherto primarily allocated to the public sector to the private sector, had a significant impact on industrial sector activities.

Guidelines

Traditional, physical resource based industries have become relatively less important, while high-tech and high value added industries and services, especially manufacturing related business services that capitalise on information technology, have expanded fast in the last decade or so. At the same time, the actual outcome of technical progress has been determined by the extent to

Box 6 (Contd.)

which technology could be diffused and exploited

throughout the economy. The mastering of information

and the introduction of knowledge intensive means of

production have become key to competitiveness and

even survival. A government's role in this context is to

facilitate global trade; improve the business environment

and enhance competitiveness of markets, including the

use of regulatory reform; spur improved corporate

governance; enable firms to better harness the benefits

of investment in knowledge and human capital; and meet

the special needs of small and medium scale enterprises.

The essential features of industrial policy and policy

strategies can be summarised as follows.

Overall Policy Direction

• Industrialists should be encouraged to face global

competition as the state cannot guarantee

protection in the long run. The government

should provide essential infrastructure and public

goods, ensure macroeconomic stability with well

announced, transparent, predictable and credible

macroeconomic policies.

• The government should adopt proper external

commercial policies such as facilitating bilateral

and multilateral trade agreements, anti-dumping

policies, and simplified tariff policies.

• Specific social and regional policies should be

brought in to address unacceptable social and

regional consequences.

• Advancement of knowledge, human capital and

technology.

• Given the fact that the availability of natural resources is no longer the major source of economic growth and that the basis for international competitiveness is knowledge and human capital, the industrial sector should move away from 'resource based* industries to 'knowledge based' and 'technology intensive' industries. The industrial policy should create an environment conducive to building up strong technological capability and a vibrant entrepreneurial culture that thrives on creativity, agility and good business sense.

• The policy should ensure the advancement of infrastructure in information and communication technology for industrialists to acquire current information on technology and encourage them to be electronically linked with the rest of the world.

8 4

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

• The policy should promote greater diversification

and innovation among and within key industry

clusters and promote knowledge driven activities

across the value chain of these industries.

• The development of human resources should be

a key strategy for industry to transform itself td

'knowledge based industry'. The labour force

should be trained to optimise the use of new

technology and materials and to combine them

effectively with creativity and innovation.

• Existing labour market regulations would require

modification to improve the free flow of labour

to newly expanding sub sectors, facilitating

labour market flexibility and labour productivity.

• An appropriate local workforce should be

developed and foreign talent with necessary skills

be attracted to support industry needs.

Investment

• The pohcy should encourage industrialists to look

for global and regional hubs for capital* new

technology, ideas, resources and markets.

' • The pohcy should encourage more investment in

assets such as technology, knowledge and skills,

business organisation and software. Such assets

drive performance of firms, as against investment

in traditional physical assets such as buildings,

machinery and equipment.

Competition policy and improving corporate

governance ~ .

• Legal systems should be introduced for

intervention in market mechanisms that are not

functioning well.

• The policy should move away from protection,

as in the long run, tjaditional tools of protection

investment of over Rs.3,500 million, which are called

'flagship' projects, and large scale export oriented projects

will continue to enjoy the tax holiday. The extension of

duty free facilities to BOI enterprises for the replacement

of vehicles was also withdrawn in the 2000 Budget. Under

the new regulations, the duty free facility for vehicles will

be granted to enterprises only on the establishment of new

projects in terms of BOI investment guidelines.

Encouraged by the positive response of entrepreneurs to the fiscal incentive scheme introduced in 1996, to promote the use of advanced technology by domestic manufacturers, the scheme was extended for a further period

such as, high tariffs and subsidies cannot provide

sufficient shelter.

• Domestic legislation should be strengthened by

bringing in to force legislation on anti-dumping

countervailing duties and anti-trust, while the

institutional framework for such legislation should

be established and strengthened.

• Enhance transparency in corporate governance.

• Introduce special legislation for business re­

organisation and liquidation.

Research and Development (R & D) Policy.

• Provide incentive to encourage R & D in industries.

• Encourage joint R&D projects among universities, research institutions and the private sector for product development, promotion of brands and innovation of new products.

• Encourage information technology incubator

facilitation linking universities,, IT training

institutions and multinational companies.

Develop Small and Medium Scale Enterprises

• Provide venture capital support and credit guarantee schemes for SMEs for supply of seed capital. -

• Develop infrastructure for international market

of two years in the Budget 2000. Several manufacturers

have imported advanced and sophisticated machinery under

this scheme and modernised their production processes. This

helped domestic manufacturers to reduce unit costs of

production and improve both product quality and

productivity. This scheme offers the duty free import of

approved machinery and equipment and a five year tax

exemption on incremental profits. Under this scheme,

approvals were given to 18 new projects and 26 existing

projects in 2000, with a total investment commitment of

Rs.1,156 million and Rs.1,306 million, respectively. These

approved projects are estimated to create new employment

opportunities for 1,839 persons. Since the commencement

of this scheme in November 1995 approvals have been

given for 199 new projects and 448 existing projects, up

to end December 2000. The investment commitment of

these projects was Rs. 14,526 million and Rs.28,105 million,

respectively. These projects are estimated to create new

employment opportunities for 40,421 persons. Under this

scheme, 409 projects have imported Rs. 11,430 million

worth of machinery and equipment at end December 2000.

Of the 647 total projects approved up to end December

2000, 45 per cent were in the Colombo District, 30 per

cent in the Gampaha District and 7.0 per cent in the

Kalutara District.

With the liberalisation of textile imports in 1998, the

government introduced the 'Restructuring Programme for

the Domestic Textile Industry' to encourage domestic

manufacturers to modernise their mills and to introduce a

new generation technology in their production process. This

measure aimed at both increasing the product quality of

domestic mills to international standards and to increase the

productivity of local mills. Under this scheme, a total of

130 manufacturers had applied for relief at end 2000. Of

these, 126 applications had been considered for relief

measures, while the other 4 applications were under

consideration. At end December 2000, the total outstanding

debt amounting to Rs.4,004 million, had been identified for

transfer to the Textile Debt Recovery Fund (TDRF). Upon

fmalisation of the Tripartite Agreement for Debt Recovery,

the total debt outstanding of 90 manufacturers amounting

to approximately Rs.3,106 million, had been transferred to

TDRF by end December 2000. In respect of this debt

transfer, the government has paid*approximately Rs.953

million to banks and financial institutions. Under this

scheme, 111 enterprises had submitted restructuring/

modernisation proposals to their banks/financial institutions

Source: Ministry of Industrial Development

and to the General Treasury. Of these, 103 enterprises have

received endorsement for their proposed projects from

banks/financial institutions and 30 enterprises have

commenced implementing their restructuring/modernisation

projects. The Domestic Textile Quota Allocation Committee,

functioning under the Ministry of Industrial Development,

commenced procurement in 1999, and allocated textile

quota in 2000, for the second consecutive year. During the

year quotas were allocated to six domestic textile

manufacturers for about 3.6 million meters of fabrics.

Textile manufacturers who do not qualify for any relief

under the restructuring programme were permitted to import

project-related machinery, spare parts and accessories duty

free. In addition, textile and ancillary industries undertaking

domestic or export market oriented projects are eligible for

BOI status by meeting the minimum investment

requirement. The minimum investment requirement for

small-scale projects has been lowered to Rs.5 million.

National Productivity Decade Programme

The Decade of National Productivity Programme (1997-

2006) launched in 1997 with the objective of enhancing

productivity in both private and public sectors, continued

during 2000. This programme has been focusing more on

creating awareness of the productivity concept and

techniques of raising productivity among all sections of the

community and for this purpose radio programmes, TV

programmes, lectures, seminars and workshops were

organised by the National Productivity Secretariat. During

2000, 63 English, 62 Sinhala and 22 Tamil radio

programmes were broadcast and 76 T.V programmes were

telecast. During the period under review 23 workshops and

lecture programmes were conducted for officials of

ministries and other public sector organisations and 3

programmes were organised for schools on the concept of

86

Parti

productivity. In addition, 15 National Productivity Steering

Committee meetings and 13 Liaison Officers' meetings

were held during this period to monitor and review

productivity activities. During the year, 2 programmes were

organised for the supervisory staff and junior executives

employed at Katunayake and Biyagama Export Processing

Zones. In addition, monthly lectures on productivity were

organised for private sector managers, where hands on

experiences on the application of productivity concepts were

shared among participants. Under this monthly lecture

programme, 6 lectures were held during the year on various

topics on productivity.

4.8 Industry Location

The government has taken several policy measures and

granted fiscal incentives in recent years to encourage

setting-up of industries in backward areas of the country.

By end 2000, 76 per cent of the enterprises registered under

Sections 16 and 17 of the BOI Law and industries

registered in the Ministry of Industrial Development were

located in the Gampaha and Colombo districts. Excessive

concentration of industries in these two districts has created

problems of labour scarcity, road congestion, escalation of

real estate prices and environmental pollution in major cities

in the province. Inadequate infrastructure facilities in other

districts were a major reason for manufacturers to locate

their factories in the Colombo and Gampaha districts.

Therefore, the government took steps to improve

infrastructure facilities in the districts situated in remote

areas under the Industrial Parks/estates Development

Programme, Dedicated Economic Centre Programme, Fifty

Garment Factory Programme, Industrial Township

Programme, and mini-EPZs programme.

The Seethawaka Industrial Park, located in Avissawella

provided facilities to 71 factory lots including 10

international standard factories. At end 2000, 64 factory lots

have been allocated among investors and 22 factories were

in commercial operation, providing direct employment to

about 6,000 persons. Another 20 projects were in various

stages of implementation at end 2000. The Seethawaka

Industrial Park attracted substantial foreign investments from

UK, Belgium, Japan, India, Hong Kong, Canada, the

Netherlands, Korea, and France. The projects located in the

Seethawaka Industrial Park produce medical gloves, soft

toys, high value garments, steel products, knitted fabrics,

zip fasteners, rubber products, wood products, processed

minerals, pharmaceuticals and sewing thread. The total

employment potential of this park is estimated at about

50,000 persons.

Under the Regional Industrial Estate Development

Programme, 11 industrial estates were in operation at end

December 2000 and two other estates were nearing

completion. Development work of 6 more industrial estates

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

has commenced in 2000. According to the Ministry of

Industrial Development, 8 more locations have been

earmarked to be developed as industrial estates in the near

future. By end 2000, nearly 186 blocks of land had been

allocated to potential investors to set up their industrial

units in Dankotuwa, Makandura Noorani, Kuruwita,

Dambadeniya, Karandeniya, Udukawa, Minuwangoda,

Homagama, Beliatta, Madawaala-Ulpatha, Bata-atha,

BaduIIa, Lakshauyana, Nawagampura, Kolonnawa, and

Ratmalana industrial estates. By the end of the year, 56

industrial projects were in commercial operation in various

industrial estates providing employment to 6,791 persons

and another 57 factories were in various stages of

construction. The Dedicated Economic Centre Programme

(DEC), which was launched with the aim of expanding and

promoting an area of specific economic activity while

building up other linkages, continued into 2000. According

to the Ministry of Industrial Development, Stage II of the

Dambulla DEC programme commenced in 2000 and the

construction work of the Keppetipola DEC has been

completed. Preliminary studies are being undertaken to

explore the possibility of setting up DECs in Emblipitiya,

Monaragala, and Pammunuwa. It has also been decided to

set up a DEC in Moratuwa to help the furniture industry

in that area.

Under the Two Hundred Garment Factory Programme, 164 garment factories were in commercial operation in 21 districts at end December 2000. Of these 164 factories, 143 factories (or 87 per cent) were located outside Colombo and Gampaha districts. The notable feature of this programme was the step taken to establish factories in difficult areas such as Vavuniya, Battticaloa, Trincomalee, Ampara, and Polonnnaruwa. At end December 2000, there were 14 factories each in the Anuradhapura and Colombo districts, 16 factories in the Ratnapura district and 11 factories each in the Puttlam, Kurunagala and Nuwara Eliya districts. Under the Fifty Garment Factory Programme introduced in the 1998 Budget, approval had been given for 67 garment factories, by end 2000. Approved projects under this programme were provided with apparel quota and BOI incentives. The criteria for the selection of these projects were based on the degree of unemployment in the area where the projects were to be located. There were 25 eligible projects in the Southern Province and the rest were in districts other than Colombo and Gampaha. The total investment in projects under this programme was estimated at Rs.2,927 million. These projects are estimated to create both direct and indirect employment for about 72,000 persons. Under this programme, 50 factories were in commercial operation in 18 districts, providing direct employment to about 20,014 persons and 9 factories were under construction at end 2000.

BOI continues to establish mini-EPZs outside Colombo to promote regional industrialisation and provide investors

87

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

with alternative locations. BOI has set up mini EPZs in

Horana, Polgahawela, Mawathagama, and Wathupitiwela

and Industrial Parks in Mirijjawila and Hanwella. The

infrastructure development under Stage-1 of the Horana

EPZ, covering an extent of 70 acres has commenced and

the work is expected to be completed by June 2001.

Industrial plots have been allocated to set up seven projects

and construction of factories is planned to commence in

early 2001. The infrastructure development work of Stage

1 of the Polgahawela EPZ covering an area of 22 acres has

already been completed and factory lots have been allocated

to six investors. Construction work in factories is in

progress and these factories are expected to commence

commercial operation during second quarter of 2001

providing employment to about 1,125 persons. Infrastructure

facilities have already been developed in Stage 1 of the

Mawathagama EPZ consisting of 20 acres of land. The

construction work on five factories is in progress and those

factories will commence commercial operation in the second

quarter of 2001, providing employment to about 1,350

persons. In the Wathupitiwela EPZ, development of Block

B area by providing internal roads, water disposal facilities

and the construction of a perimeter fence has commenced.

Infrastructure development at the Koggala EPZ continued

with land development and factory construction work under

a Special Incentive Scheme implemented by BOI. In this

zone 12 new investment projects were under implementation

in 2000. BOI has identified 50 acres of land at Salawa

Estate, Hanwella to set up an industrial park to locate

enterprises that manufacture defence related items.

Infrastructure development work of this park is planned to

commence in 2001.
