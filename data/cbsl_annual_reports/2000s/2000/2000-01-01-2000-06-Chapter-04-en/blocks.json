Better prices received for exported items, growing markets and the relatively lower interest rates that prevailed in the first half of the year also helped expand the existing capacity. Capacity expansion was relatively high in the industrial categories of food, beverages and tobacco, (3.9 per cent), textiles, wearing apparel and leather products (5.8 per cent), paper and paper products (4.8 per cent) and fabricated metal products (4.2 per cent). Overall capacity utilisation in the industrial sector increased from 83 per cent in 1999 to 85 per cent in 2000.",

Labour productivity improved significantly in the industrial categories of food, beverages and tobacco (4.0 per cent); textiles, wearing apparel and leather (3.1 per cent); chemicals, rubber and plastic (6.7 per cent) and fabricated metal (4.4 per cent). The installation of automated systems and the adoption of modern technology in recent years helped improve labour productivity through reduction of human error, lower wastage and improvement of personal motivation. The adoption of better management techniques, training in skills development and a reduction of excess labour also contributed to the improvement of labour productivity. Improvements in the working environment in factories and welfare facilities such as free medical care, meals and transport facilities, especially in the apparel, food, beverages and tobacco industries had beneficial effects on the improvement of labour productivity.",

Those infrastructure facilities include power generation, telecommunications, port development, highways, industrial parks/estates, industrial townships and skill development. As information technology has been identified as one of the thrust areas for industrial development, special incentives were introduced in the Budget 2000 to encourage the establishment of 50 training institutes in major population centres covering all districts.

A five year tax holiday is available for such institutes, if they locate outside the Colombo District, and have a capacity to train a minimum of 300 persons per year. As there exists considerable potential for local manufacture of non-combat military items such as belts, boots, uniforms, tents etc., for the use of the armed forces, the police, prisons and for export, the Budget 2000 proposed to establish a separate",

Of these 164 factories, 143 factories (or 87 per cent) were located outside Colombo and Gampaha districts. The notable feature of this programme was the step taken to establish factories in difficult areas such as Vavuniya, Battticaloa, Trincomalee, Ampara, and Polonnnaruwa. At end December 2000, there were 14 factories each in the Anuradhapura and Colombo districts, 16 factories in the Ratnapura district and 11 factories each in the Puttlam, Kurunagala and Nuwara Eliya districts. Under the Fifty Garment Factory Programme introduced in the 1998 Budget, approval had been given for 67 garment factories, by end 2000. Approved projects under this programme were provided with apparel quota and BOI incentives. The criteria for the selection of these projects were based on the degree of unemployment in the area where the projects were to be located. There were 25 eligible projects in the Southern Province and the rest were in districts other than Colombo and Gampaha. The total investment in projects under this programme was estimated at Rs.2,927 million. These projects are estimated to create both direct and indirect employment for about 72,000 persons. Under this programme, 50 factories were in commercial operation in 18 districts, providing direct employment to about 20,014 persons and 9 factories were under construction at end 2000.",
