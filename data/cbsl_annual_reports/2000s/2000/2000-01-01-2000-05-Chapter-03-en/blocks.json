Although local rubber prices improved during the latter part of the year, production did not respond immediately to improved prices owing to the degraded condition in some rubber lands. Yield per hectare dropped by 6 per cent to 712 kg in 2000. The yield in major rubber producing countries is almost twice the yield in Sri Lanka, indicating that if proper strategies are adopted, it would be improved considerably.",

The reduction of the import duty on rice in the fourth quarter of 1999 resulted in a large quantity of rice, amounting to over two thirds of total rice imports during 1999, being imported to the country during this period. These imports adversely affected local millers and stockists of paddy who obtained financing from commercial banks for purchase of paddy. Some millers had to close down their mills. The ad hoc duty reductions and associated uncertainty made paddy millers and stockists reluctant to purchase and stock paddy on a large scale after the 1999/2000 Maha harvest, which resulted in declining the paddy prices. The adverse impact of this policy is felt even during the Maha harvest of 2001, where the farm gate prices were not very remunerative.",

Towards the end of the season, in April 2000, the government directed the CWE to purchase paddy from the farmers at Rs.13 per kg. During the Maha harvest, CWE purchased approximately 50,000 metric tons of paddy. Sales had to be effected at lower prices and the loss incurred by CWE in this operation is reported to be about Rs.75 million. During the Yala harvest, the government directed the CWE and the cooperative societies to purchase paddy at Rs.13 per kg. Both institutions were provided with concessionary credit.

The drop in collection is attributed to the industrial dispute that prevailed in the KMILL and the adverse security situtation that prevailed in the Batticaloa and Valachchenai areas. Milk suppliers benefited from an upward revision of milk purchasing prices by KMILL since September 2000. The purchasing price of milk was increased by 6 per cent to Rs. 14.77 per litre. However, according to the Ministry of Estate Infrastructure and Livestock Development, the price received by producers remained unchanged at Rs. 13.56 per litre in 2000. The average cost of production of milk in 2000 increased by 1 per cent to Rs.5.84 per litre. The Indian National Dairy Development Board, which managed KMILL, had to leave the company in April 2000 and since then, the management has been undertaken by the Sri Lankan government. During 2000, milk and milk product imports increased by 6 per cent to 61, 194 metric tons valued at Rs.8,945 million.",

To improve the veterinary facilities and extension services, 65 new Veterinary Officers (VOs) were recruited during the year. A special dairy development project was introduced in 2000, with a view to revitalising the dairy sector in up-country estates. The project period is 3 years and will initially be implemented in five estates on a pilot basis. The objective of the project is to increase milk production in estates by improving the management of existing dairy cattle and by increasing the dairy cattle population in the estates. Nearly 600 estate worker families will directly benefit from this project.",
