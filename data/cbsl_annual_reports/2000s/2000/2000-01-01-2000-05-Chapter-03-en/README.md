3. AGRICULTURE, FISHING AND FORESTRY

3.1 Production Trends

Agricultural output, which grew by 4.5 per cent in 1999,

expanded further by 1.8 per cent in 2000, reflecting largely

the significant increases in tea and coconut output.

However, the rate of growth was low due to a drop in the

output of paddy and rubber as well as a decline in output

of some other field crops.

Tea production, after a record output in 1999,

increased by a further 8 per cent surpassing the 300 million

kg mark for the first time and reached a new peak output

level of 306 million kg. Coconut output increased by 8 per

cent to 3,055 million nuts, the highest production ever on

record. The lagged effect of the favourable weather in 1999

and well distributed rainfall in 2000, coupled with an

increased applijution of fertiliser in 1999, contributed

positively to the improvement in coconut output. Rubber

output, which has shown a declining trend over the years,

declined further and reported the lowest output ever on

record. Paddy production, which reached a peak output in

1999, declined marginally as the Yala harvest dropped by

4 per cent. A reduction was seen in the extent sown and

harvested, though the average yield of paddy improved and

reached the highest level ever achieved. Of the other field

crops, potato production increased significantly by 78 per

cent owing to the protection provided to potato cultivation

by imposing a high tariff on imports. The output of most

other field crops such as chillies, big onions, black gram,

maize and green gram was less than in 1999. Sugar

production decreased, while the production of milk and eggs

increased compared to the previous year.

3.2 Agricultural Policy

The agricultural policy of the government focused on

allowing greater participation of the private sector in

production and marketing, while the government acted as

a facilitator in the development of the sector.

Privatisation of the regional plantation companies,

which began in 1995, progressed steadily through 2000.

Under the divestiture plan, 51 per cent of the stock was

sold to the management companies while 10 per cent of the

stock in each company was gifted to the employees. Of the

balance stock, 20 per cent was to be issued as an Initial

Public Offering (IPO) and the remaining 19 per cent was

to be sold through the stock market. At end 2000, the

privatisation of 8 companies had been completed and all the

shares were fully sold. In another 8 companies, 19 per cent

of the stock is still with the government, while in 4

companies, 39 per cent of the stock is with the government.

During the year, Malwatte Valley Plantations Ltd, sold

20 per cent of its shares through an IPO and reduced the

government stake further. Depending on market conditions,

the balance shares will be sold through the stock market

in the future. As the tea prices are good at present, the

plantation companies should seriously think of building up

a self-generated capital development fund for long-term

investment in the sector. Such investment would make the

companies resilient when the prices take a downturn.

In the domestic agricultural sector, six thrust areas

have been identified for further reforms with the objective

of improving productivity and increasing output. The areas

identified were research, production promotion and

extension, supply of seeds and planting material, private

sector participation in commercial agriculture, marketing and

institutional reforms.

Agricultural research will be re-organised in the form

of demand driven research to resolve practical problems

faced by farmers. Priority areas for agricultural research will

be identified and coordinated through the Council for

Agricultural Research and Policy (CARP) in order to

optimise the usage of research funding.

Continuing with the National Seed Policy introduced

in 1996, private sector participation in producing and

marketing seeds and planting material was further

strengthened during the year. Encouraged by progress at the

Hingurakgoda seed farm, which was privatised in 1998, a

major portion of the government owned Pelwehera farm

was leased to the private sector. Along with the lease,

moveable assets of the farm were also sold. Meanwhile,

action has been taken to enact a Seed Act, so as to grant

the Seed Certification Service legal authority to regulate the

quality of locally produced and imported seeds and planting

materials.

The Plant Quarantine Act has been revised and updated

to suit a liberalised policy environment and will be

4 9

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

implemented soon. The Agrarian Services Act was also

updated to regularise the ownership of land, create a land

owning class of farmers, provide more authority and

empower grass roots level organisations.

There is a need for adopting a consistent tariff policy

in the agricultural sector in order to ensure a sustainable

high growth rate in domestic agricultural output in the long

run while minimising short-term fluctuation in agricultural

produce and their prices. Ad hoc changes in tariffs,

implemented with a view to either protecting farmers or

consumers have generated long lasting unhealthy results.

For example, the tariff on rice imports was reduced from

35 per cent to 10 per cent for the period 23 October to 31

December 1999, leading to the importation of a large stock

of rice and a substantial decline in paddy prices after the

Maha harvest in 2000. This led the government to intervene

in the market through price setting. Accordingly, the

government directed the Co-operative Wholesale

Establishment (CWE) and the Co-operative Societies to

purchase paddy at a minimum price of Rs.13 per kg. Both

institutions were also provided with concessionary credit for

this purpose through the state banks with a Treasury

guarantee. The interest rate at the time of granting the loan

had been fixed at 14 per cent and the Treasury had agreed

to pay the interest. Although this intervention helped to

arrest the deteriorating price of paddy to a certain extent,

it jeoparadised some of the forward contracts the farmers

had entered into under the "Govi Sahanaya" scheme where

the contract price was fixed at Rs.12 per kg. As the

intervention was not sufficient, the government had to

restrict the import of rice by bringing it under licensing

requirement. Thus, rice imports have been under licensing

since 17 July 2000. The CWE is still carrying a large stock

of paddy, continuously making losses.

During the year, the government also increased tariff

rates on edible oil and subsequently imposed a surcharge

with a view to protecting the coconut oil industry. This was

a reversal of the tariff reduction granted in 1996, in the

wake of a shortfall in coconut production.that had been

granted to facilitate desiccated coconut millers to purchase

nuts at a lower price.

After strong lobbying by potato farmers facing

difficulties in competing with low cost imports, the

government imposed a 35 per cent surcharge on potato

imports in August 2000 in addition to the existing tariff rate

of 35 per cent on potatoes. Subsequently, in December

2000, this tariff was changed to a specific duty of Rs.20

per kg. As a result of the heavy protection, domestic potato

production increased by 78 per cent at the expense of

consumers as the all island average retail price of potatoes

increased by 23 per cent, and remained high in 2000.

3.3 Export Crops

Tea

In 2000, tea production increased by 8 per cent over the

peak production in 1999, continuing the upward trend

experienced since 1993, reaching a record level of 306

million kg and surpassing the 300 million kg level for the

first time. Favourable tea prices, increased fertiliser

application and favourable weather were the major

contributory factors for this increase in production. This

record performance in production was mainly reflected in

a notable improvement in the performance of low elevation

areas whose output, accounting for 54 per cent of the total

production, increased by 12 per cent in 2000 to 166 million

kg. Production in high and medium elevations, with a share

of 27 per cent and 18 per cent, respectively, increased by

3 per cent and 5 per cent respectively, in 2000.

The smallholder sector, accounting for 60 per cent of

the total output, significantly improved its performance,

recording an increase of 12 per cent in 2000 to 184 million

kg. Plantation companies, which accounted for the balance

in the output, recorded a growth of only 2 per cent. The

yields in the smallholder sector improved by 2 per cent

over the preceding year to reach a new record of 2,216 kg

per hectare in 2000. The average national yield of tea was

5 0

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

1,618 kg per hectare. The yield in the estate sector is

estimated to have improved by 6 per cent to 1,151 kg per

hectare, mainly on account of improved management in

estates under the privatised plantation companies. However,

average yields in the estate sector remained well below the

smallholder sector as a large extent of tea in the estate

sector is still under low yielding seedling tea, compared to

the high yielding vegetatively propagated (VP) tea of

smallholders.

Year

The production of cut, tear and curl (CTC) tea declined

by 4 per cent to 17.5 million kg in 2000. Local CTC teas

cannot compete with low priced competitors in the global

CTC tea markets due to the high cost of production. As a

result, CTC tea imports for blending and re-exporting

amounted to 2.8 million kg in 2000, an increase of 67 per

cent from 1999. However, the quantity of tea imported for

blending accounted for less than 1 per cent of domestic tea

production.

The annual average price at the Colombo Auctions

improved by 18 per cent to Rs 135.53 per kg in 2000,

continuing the trend that started in July 1999. The price

increase was steeper during the second half of 2000. The

main reasons for the price increase were a production

shortfall in Kenya, the active participation of Russia at the

Colombo Auctions and the depreciation of the rupee against

the US dollar during the year.

The quantity sold at the Colombo Auctions increased

by 6 per cent to 277 million kg in 2000. The volume of

exports during the year increased by 7 per cent to 288

million kg. Combined with the improvement in prices,

export earnings from tea rose by 22 per cent to Rs 53,133

million in 2000. Russia continued to be the largest buyer

of Sri Lanka tea and accounted for 16 per cent of the

export volume. UAE, Syria and Turkey were other leading

buyers.

Bulk tea exports amounted to 183 million kg or 63 per cent of total tea exports. As in 1999, the share of value added tea exports remained at 37 per cent in 2000. The

share of tea in packs and tea bags was 30 per cent and 4

per cent, respectively, while other types accounted for the

remaining 3 per cent.

During 2000, the Tea Small Holdings Development

Authority (TSHDA) continued to assist the tea industry by

implementing subsidy schemes for replanting and new

planting, as well as by providing advisory and extension

services. In addition, the TSHDA continued the

implementation of the fertiliser credit scheme and supplied

15,317 metric tons of fertiliser through Tea Development

Societies, recording a 28 per cent growth over 1999. Under

the 'Development Fund' programme, smallholders were

provided with credit facilities to purchase inputs through

Tea Smallholder Development Societies. At end 2000, there

were 1,172 Tea Smallholder Development Societies.

Rubber

Rubber production declined by 10 per cent to 87 million kg in 2000. This was the lowest production reported over the past 50 years. Smallholders accounted for 71 per cent of total production and plantation companies for the balance. Smallholder production dropped by 13 per cent to 61.8 million kg, production of plantation companies dropped by 7 per cent to 25.4 million kg in 2000.

The drop in production is due to both the lower extent under cultivation and lower yield. The extent under rubber cultivation has declined over the years as a result of competition for land from more lucrative other agricultural

crops and real estate development projects. The depressed prices over a considerable period of time led to the abandoning of tapping in some marginal lands as proceeds could not even cover the cost of tapping. This also led to poor management of smallholdings, which in turn led to lower production. Although local rubber prices improved during the latter part of the year, production did not respond immediately to improved prices owing to the degraded condition in some rubber lands. Yield per hectare dropped by 6 per cent to 712 kg in 2000. The yield in major rubber producing countries is almost twice the yield in Sri Lanka, indicating that if proper strategies are adopted, it would be improved considerably.

Domestic consumption of rubber in the industrial sector, which has steadily increased during the last few years, increased marginally to reach 55 million kg and accounted for 63 per cent of the domestic rubber production. Natural rubber exports declined by 23 per cent to 33 million kg in 2000. The cost of production of rubber increased by 2 per cent to Rs.45 per kg in 2000.

International prices for natural rubber remain low due to poor demand from rubber consuming countries. According to the International Rubber Study Group, natural rubber prices declined for all types and grades in all markets as the International Natural Rubber Organisation (INRO) took action to dispose of its buffer stocks. Prices at the Colombo Auction improved during the year. The annual average price for RSS1 and latex IX increased by 21 per cent and 29 per cent, respectively, over 1999. Despite the price increase, the profit margin available to the producer is still low, making rubber cultivation less attractive.

To arrest the unhealthy trend in production, the

government initiated new development programmes, while

providing support to existing programmes. The Rubber

Development Department (RDD) implemented the

'Thurusaviya Scheme' to improve the lobbying power of

smallholders to obtain better extension services, obtain help

in selling their latex at a remunerative price and to obtain

credit. By end 2000, 253 'Thurusaviya Societies' had been

_1 Chart 3 a, Price and Cost of Production Indices: Rubber , , (1990=100)

established throughout the rubber growing districts. The

RDD also conducted programmes to train 1,800 rubber

tappers. New planting and replanting subsidy schemes

continued in 2000. During the year Rs.58 million was

disbursed for replanting and Rs.25 million for new planting.

The declining trend in replanting of rubber, seen from 1996,

reversed in 2000. According to the RDD the extent of

newly planted and replanted areas have increased by 15 and

23 per cent, respectively, in 2000.

According to the Rubber Research Institute (RRI) of

Sri Lanka, the natural rubber industry basically depends on

two rubber clones, RRIC 100 and PB 86. In the event of

a pest or disease affecting these two clones, the entire

rubber industry could be in danger. To minimise these risks,

RRI has recommended greater diversity in clones. A

diversification plan has been prepared for implementation

in the near future.

During the year, there had been some international

attempts to arrest the deterioration in international rubber

prices. After the collapse of the International Natural

Rubber Agreement, Thailand and Malaysia formed a joint

venture to buy some of the rubber in the INRO buffer

stocks. Meanwhile Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia

announced a plan to set up a benchmark price for rubber

exports and to stock-pile excess rubber to support prices.

It is expected that the minimum export price would be

flexible and would be reviewed periodically in order to

reflect changing world prices.

Coconut

Coconut production in 2000, estimated at 3,055 million

nuts, was the best output ever on record. This was an

improvement of 8 per cent over the output in 1999. The

increase in output was attributed to the well-distributed

rainfall in 2000, as well as the lagged effect of favourable

rainfall in 1999. Higher fertiliser application in 1999 also

contributed to the improvement in output. However,

increased nut supply resulted in a steep drop in the price

of nuts.

In line with the increased nut production, the three major coconut based products also showed improvements. Desiccated coconut (DC), which reported a 50 per cent increase in the previous year, improved further by 32 per cent and recorded the highest quantity of DC ever produced. Almost all DC mills ran at full capacity and the industry nearly reached the full installed capacity of 90,000 metric tons. DC exports also reported a new high level of 83,000 metric tons, which indicated a 30 per cent increase from the previous year. Other kernel products also improved significantly. Coconut oil production increased by 27 per cent. Exports of copra, fresh nuts, coconut cream and milk powder increased by 30 per cent, 26 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively.

52

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

The price of DC, which remained attractive in 1999,

fell due to increased global supply arising mainly from the

Philippines and Indonesia. During the year, domestic prices

for DC declined by 40 per cent from Rs.64.70 per kg in

January to Rs.38.50 per kg in December. The average

export price (fob) of kernel products declined by 26 per

cent to Rs.7.35 per nut as against Rs.9.95 per nut in the

previous year. Although the nut equivalent of the three

kernel products exported increased by 31 per cent, export

earnings dropped by 3 per cent in rupee terms owing to

the decline in international prices of these products. The

price of copra declined during the first three quarters but

improved during the last quarter due to a renewed import

interest from Pakistan.

Both international and local prices of coconut oil

declined during the year. Coconut oil, which fetched US

dollars 727 per metric ton (c&f) in Europe in December

1999, declined by 54 per cent and fetched only US dollars

330 per metric ton in December 2000. In the local market,

the price of coconut oil dropped by 30 per cent to

Rs.38,571 per metric ton.

Low domestic prices for coconut were the combined

result of increased production and the non-availability of

sufficient absorption capacity in the oil industry. The

domestic coconut oil industry was adversely affected by the

surge in imports of edible oil into the country during the

last few years, as a result of the concessionary rate of duty

granted to edible oil in June 1998. This measure was taken

to support DC millers who would benefit from the reduction

in nut prices that would result from a decline in competition

for nuts from the oil industry. The duty on edible oil other

than coconut oil was reduced from 35 per cent to 5 per

cent. This resulted in the import of large stocks of cheap

edible oil against which coconut oil could not compete.

Consequently a large number of oil mills had to be closed

down. The number of oil mills, which stood at 980 in 1987,

came down to 156 by 1999. Of this, only 25 per cent or

38 mills were in regular operation. With sharply reduced

capacity in the coconut oil milling industry, the excess nut

production could not be absorbed, and there was a

downward pressure on nut prices during 2000. This

situation prompted the government to revise its tariff policy

on edible oils. The duty waiver granted to edible oil was

removed and the duty was fixed at 25 per cent in April

2000. Ultimately, to arrest the fall in nut prices further, the

government decided to impose a 25 per cent surcharge in

addition to the revised tariff on all edible oil imports.

Other Export Crops

Other export crops include spices such as cinnamon, pepper, cloves, cardamoms, nutmeg, mace, beverages such as coffee and cocoa, and other agricultural produce such as unmanufactured tobacco, arecanut, betel leaves, cashew kernels and essential oils. The growing of other export crops has increased considerably over the years and since

53

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

1990, earnings from these crops as a whole have surpassed

earnings from coconut exports and rubber exports. In fact,

since 1998, export earnings from these crops have exceeded

the combined export earnings from rubber and coconut.

Export earnings from other export crops in 2000 grew by

1.6 per cent in rupee terms to Rs. 11,784 million but

declined by 5.6 per cent in US dollar terms. All sub

categories, excluding pepper, nutmeg, mace and essential

oils, declined in export volumes.

Cinnamon, the most important crop in this category, contributed nearly 30 per cent of the total earnings from other export crops in 2000. Sri Lanka is the largest producer of cinnamon in the world, accounting for about two thirds of world production. Sri Lanka exports more than 90 per cent of its production mainly in the form of quills, featherings, bark oil and leaf oil. This is an area where Sri Lanka can move to greater value addition, as a very large proportion of cinnamon is still exported in bulk form as quills. Cinnamon powder and tablets have a high demand from consumers in South America and Europe. The area under cinnamon was 25,000 hectares. Production showed a marginal improvement in 2000. However, there was a decline in export earnings due to a drop in prices and quantity exported.

Pepper production, which has shown a steady improvement during the last few years, increased further by 15 per cent to 10,676 metric tons in 2000. This was due to the increase in new planting during the last few years under the Export Agriculture Assistance Scheme (EAAS) implemented by the Department of Export Agriculture (DEA). However, the price of pepper in the world market declined due to an increase in world supply. As a result, average auction prices and farm gate prices declined in 2000 compared to 1999. Despite the drop in prices, export earnings from pepper increased by 22 per cent to Rs 1,587 million in 2000 due to the increase in the volume of exports by 29 per cent.

The world market price of nutmeg rose in 2000 due to a supply shortage. The increase in quantity exported and higher prices contributed to increasing earnings from nutmeg and mace by 35 per cent.

Export earnings from coffee, arecanuts and cardamoms declined by 92 per cent, 89 per cent and 51 per cent, respectively, in 2000 due to a drop in export volumes. Earnings from cloves and betel leaves also declined in 2000 by 26 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively, due to a drop in export volumes.

During 2000, over 235 metric tons of essential oils were exported and export earnings increased by 6 per cent to Rs 290 million. Of the essential oils, cinnamon leaf oil and citronella oil were the main items.

Cultivation of foliage and cut flowers has expanded significantly in recent years and these have become more

important as sources of export earnings. In addition to

large-scale export-oriented cultivators, there are a large

number of small-scale growers of foliage and cut flowers

operating on a self-employment basis. Large-scale

cultivation of foliage and cut flowers is done in the Nuwara

Eliya, Gampaha, Kandy and Kurunegala disticts. Large

quantities of foliage plants, rooted and un-rooted cuttings

and flowers such as carnations, orchids and anthuriums

were exported during 2000. Thus, the export earnings from

foliage and cut flowers increased by 9 per cent to Rs 624

million.

3.4 Domestic Agriculture

Paddy

Paddy production during the 2000 cultivation year was 2.86

million metric tons (137 million bushels), a marginal

decline of 0.3 per cent from the peak output in 1999. The

decline in output reflects a 4 per cent drop in production

during the Yala season and an increase of 2 per cent in

the Maha season. Extents sown and harvested declined,

while the average yields improved in spite of a drop in

fertiliser application per hectare.

Output during the 1999/2000 Maha season increased by 2 per cent to 1.8 million metric tons. The improvement in the Maha harvest was achieved wholly on account of an improvement in the yield, as there was a drop in the extent sown and harvested.

The most notable improvements in production were

reported from the districts of Kurunegala, Polonnaruwa,

Anuradhapura and Jaffna. The Kurunegala District, which

reported the best output during the Maha season, reported

a 12 per cent improvement over the previous Maha season

while the Polonnaruwa District, which reported the second

best output, recorded a 15 per cent improvement over the

previous season. These two districts together accounted for

almost a quarter of the Maha output. In the Kurunegala

District, production improved solely on account of a 14 per

cent improvement in the yield while the net extent

harvested dropped by 2 per cent. In the Polonnaruwa

District, the yield and the net extent harvested improved by

54

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

7 per cent each. The Ampara District, which reported the

highest output during the 1999 Maha season, reported a 17

per cent drop in production and was placed third. The five

major paddy producing districts of Kurunegala,

Polonnaruwa, Ampara, Anurathapura and Mahaweli 'H' area

together accounted for more than half (53 per cent) the

paddy output during the Maha season.

Paddy production during the Yala season, which

reported the highest production ever achieved in 1999,

declined by 4 per cent to 1.1 million metric tons during

the 2000 Yala season. The net extent harvested during Yala

2000 declined by 8 per cent, while the average yield

improved by 5 per cent.

Chart 3.4 Paddy Production

1996 1997 1996 1999 2000

Output in the districts of Ampara, Polonnaruwa,

Anuradhapura and Hambantota reported increases. However,

the ouput in Kurunegala and the Mahaweli 'H' area

suffered severe setbacks. The output in Kurunegala declined

by 61 per cent while the Mahaweli 'H' area reported a 31

per cent drop. Both extent cultivated and yield in

Kurunegala and the Mahaweli 'H' area declined due to

inadequate irrigation water.

The Ampara District reported the highest Yala output

for the seventh consecutive year and accounted for over one

fifth of total Yala production. Ampara, Polonnaruwa and

Hambantota together accounted for almost half the Yala

output.

The increasing trend in annual average yields continued

for the fourth consecutive year. The annual average yield

increased by 5 per cent over the previous year and was

3,854 kg per hectare, the best annual average yield ever on

record. The improvement in the average yield during both

Maha and Yala seasons by 5 per cent each, contributed

positively to the improvement in the overall average yield.

The average yields reported for Maha and Yala turned out

to be the best ever reported to the two cultivation seasons.

The Maha yield of 3,798 kg per hectare surpassed the

previous best yield for Maha reported in 1987 by 3 per

cent. The average yield for Yala of 3,957 kg per hectare

was 4 per cent higher than the previous best reported in

Yala 1998. Yield levels of the major and minor irrigated

areas, which accounted for 82 per cent of the extent

cultivated, improved during Yala 2000. The combined effect

of this improvement in yield contributed positively towards

the improvement in the overall yield, despite a decline in

the yield in the rainfed areas.

The special 'yaya' demonstration programme organised by the Extension Division of the Department of Agriculture (DOA) to improve productivity by introducing a package of improved practices continued for the fifth consecutive year. Nearly 2,300 'yaya' demonstrations, benefiting about 54,000 farmer families were held during the year as against 1,700 demonstration benefiting 34,200 farmer families in the previous year. However, the total extent covered by demonstrations declined from 58,200 ha to 46,000 ha indicating that smaller farmers had been selected for the demonstrations during the year.

Farmers faced difficulties in marketing their paddy as a result of the import of rice under concessionary tariff rates that prevailed during the latter part of 1999. The reduction of the import duty on rice in the fourth quarter of 1999 resulted in a large quantity of rice, amounting to over two thirds of total rice imports during 1999, being imported to the country during this period. These imports adversely affected local millers and stockists of paddy who obtained financing from commercial banks for purchase of paddy. Some millers had to close down their mills. The ad hoc duty reductions and associated uncertainty made paddy millers and stockists reluctant to purchase and stock paddy on a large scale after the 1999/2000 Maha harvest, which resulted in declining the paddy prices. The adverse impact of this policy is felt even during the Maha harvest of 2001, where the farm gate prices were not very remunerative.

The situation prompted the government to intervene in the market through CWE and cooperative societies to stabilise paddy prices. However, during much of the year, the farm gate price of paddy was well below the purchasing price announced by the CWE. Cooperatives and the CWE purchased paddy at prices ranging from Rs.lO per kg upwards. Towards the end of the season, in April 2000, the government directed the CWE to purchase paddy from the farmers at Rs.13 per kg. During the Maha harvest, CWE purchased approximately 50,000 metric tons of paddy. Sales had to be effected at lower prices and the loss incurred by CWE in this operation is reported to be about Rs.75 million. During the Yala harvest, the government directed the CWE and the cooperative societies to purchase paddy at Rs.13 per kg. Both institutions were provided with concessionary credit. CWE purchases during the Yala season amounted to approximately 38,000 metric tons of paddy.

With a view to improving the domestic price of paddy,

the government imposed a licensing requirement for the

import of rice with effect from 17 July 2000. This import

restriction, coupled with a good domestic harvest, led to a

sharp decline in the rice imports. Rice imported during

2000 amounted to approximately 14,900 metric tons

compared to 214,000 metric tons in the previous year.

The depressed paddy prices that prevailed during the

Maha harvest discouraged the application of fertiliser. As

a result, fertiliser issues to the paddy sector declined by 14

per cent, especially during the Yala season.

Other Field Crops

The other field crops sector reported a mixed

performance. The production of potato and ground nuts

increased, while the production of big onions, chillies, black

gram, green gram, sesame and maize decreased.

Potato production increased by 78 per cent. Both an

increase in the extent cultivated and an improvement in the

yield contributed towards the enhanced output. The extent

under potato cultivation, which had declined since 1996

after the removal of the ban on potato imports, increased

by 68 per cent to 3,642 ha. in response to the high

protection provided by way of increased tariffs. The tariff

rates were revised on 30 August 2000. A 35 per cent

surcharge was imposed on top of the existing 35 per cent

duty until 07 December 2000. Thereafter, the duty was

revised once again and a specific duty of Rs. 20 per kg

was imposed on 08 December 2000. Potato yields increased

for the third consecutive year. During the cultivation year,

potato yield improved by 6 per cent to 13.2 metric tons per

ha.

Big onion output, which increased three-fold in 1999,

declined by 42 per cent to 36,600 metric tons in 2000. The

increased output in 1999, resulting in low prices and

difficulties in disposing of their produce, discouraged

production in 2000.

Chillie production that has declined consistently since

1993, reported a further 7 per cent drop to 14,000 metric

tons in 2000. During this period the extent cultivated under

chillie declined steadily and the extent cultivated in 2000

was less than half the extent cultivated during 1993. This

decline has been more drastic after 1996 with the removal

of the licensing requirement to import chillies. Further,

CWE has reduced the local purchasing price of chillies

significantly since 1998. Output of black gram and green

gram also declined, by 19 per cent and 15 per cent,

respectively, in 2000.

In the wake of a drop in production, imports of big

onions and chillies increased by 40 per cent and 15 per

cent, respectively. Meanwhile imports of black gram

increased by 49 per cent, while green gram imports

declined by 10 per cent.

The licensing requirement on the import of maize grain

for the provender industry was removed in March 2000, and

an import duty of 10 per cent was imposed as against the

duty free imports allowed when the commodity was under

licence. Maize accounts for almost a quarter of the total

extent cultivated under other field crops. The biggest

problem faced by maize growers was the marketing of their

produce at a reasonable price. The majority of maize

farmers do not apply any fertiliser. They also do not use

high quality higher yielding seed varieties. Thus, the yields

realised are much lower than the potential levels. During

the year, 115,000 metric tons of maize grain to the value

of over one billion rupees was imported for the provender

industry. This is an area where the forward market

mechanism could work well since maize goes into a

processing industry, which uses it as a raw material for

producing animal feed. Both the feed manufacturers as well

as the farmers could benefit from forward contracts. If the

56

Parti

farmers are assured of the price that they would get before

the commencement of the season, they could decide on

whether to invest in intensive cultivation using better

planting material and the application of fertiliser. Similarly,

feed manufacturers could decide on their investment

patterns if they knew in advance the price of their raw

material.

Vegetables and Fruit

The Department of Census and Statistics estimates that

vegetable production increased by 5 per cent to 580,000

metric tons in 2000. Production of both upcountry and low

country vegetables is estimated to have increased by 5 per

cent each, due to an increase in the extent under cultivation.

However, prices of many vegetable varieties were relatively

higher than in 1999. The average retail price of low country

vegetables and up country vegetables was in the range of

Rs 25.00 - Rs 35.00 per kg and Rs 28.00 - Rs 42.00 per

kg, respectively.

Vegetables are exported both fresh and in processed

form. Among vegetables, gherkins were the main item

exported in semi-processed and processed form. Gherkins

are grown on a commercial scale with buyback

arrangements with the exporters. The exporter provides the

technical know-how as well as the inputs and credit to

farmers and buys back the produce at a guaranteed price.

The volume of gherkin exports was 2.6 million kg in 2000

and export earnings Rs 179 million. Despite the decline in

export volume by 8 per cent, export earnings increased by

20 per cent due to more value addition. Japan was the

major market for gherkins. Leeks, capsicum and mixed

vegetables in fresh form were exported in relatively small

quantities to the Maldives, East Asia and Europe. Processed

vegetable exports are still limited to very small quantities.

Commercial scale cultivation is practised in respect of

only a few varieties of fruit such as pineapple, banana and

rambutan. Among fruit exports, pineapple was the main

item, accounting for 42 per cent of the total export volume

of fruit. Mangoes, lemon and banana were exported in small

quantities. To enhance exports of fresh fruit, commercial

cultivation with high yielding new varieties is essential.

During 2000, fresh and dried fruit (including tamarind)

exports amounted to 6,000 metric tons and earnings

amounted to Rs 339 million. The Maldives, East Asia and

Germany were the major markets for fruit exports, while

Pakistan and India were the major markets for tamarind.

Processed products such as fruit juices, jellies, jams,

marmalade and canned fruits were exported to these markets

and earnings from them amounted to Rs 235 million.

It is reported that about 40 per cent of vegetable and fruits go waste between harvesting and marketing due to poor post harvest handling, storage and transportation. Reducing waste will reduce price levels while improvements

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

in processing and storage will reduce price fluctuations. To

impart knowledge on good post harvest, storage and

handling practices, the EDB, Department of Agriculture and

Department of Export Agriculture carried out several

awareness programms for the benefit of growers. Provision

of proper storage facilities, and containers suitable to pack

the produce during transportation and conducting awareness

programmes on the importance of careful handling are some

important measures that could be taken to minimise post

harvest losses in fruit and vegetables. A new institute,

called the Institute of Post Harvest Technology (IPHT),

was set up in Anuradhapura in 2000 to carryout research

and develop new technologies to minimise post harvest

losses in agricultural products. During 2000, Sri Lanka

imported 41,000 metric tons of fruits to the value of Rs

1.2 billion. This was an increase of 13 per cent over the

quantity imported in 1999. As in the preceding year, apples,

oranges, dates and grapes were the main varieties of fruit

imported. The trade deficit in fruit was Rs 834 million in

2000.

Sugar

Although the sugar industry in Sri Lanka has been in

existence for over four decades, it accounted for only 10

per cent of total supply in 2000. Even though certain

structural changes have taken place during this period, the

development of the industry has been far below expectations

and the anticipated targets have never been achieved. In

recent years, the sector has shown a negative growth both

in terms of cane and sugar production. The number of

operational factories also decreased from four to two in the

1990s. Thus, the performance of the sugar industry has been

disappointing, resulting in increased dependence on

imported sugar. The factories in operation faced financial

difficulties because of high cost of production and non-

remunerative prices in the face of low international prices.

The sugar industry at present is neither fully privatised nor

fully public sector owned, which has resulted in a lack of

direction and leadership. Unless certain corrective measures

are taken in the sugar cane pricing policy and in the size

of holdings of the allotments, sugar cane cultivation may

not be an economically viable venture. At present, the

payment for private cane purchases is based only on the

weight, irrespective of the quality. As recovery rates are

directly related to the quality of cane, a pricing system

based on quality will act as an incentive to the supply of

good quality cane.

Sugar production in 2000 declined by 3 per cent to

64,000 metric tons. Pelwatte, which accounted for nearly

63 per cent of the sugar output, reported an 18 per cent

drop in production compared to the previous year. The

output at Sevanagala improved by 41 per cent to 24,000

metric tons, but was not sufficient to record an overall

57

Part I Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

increase. The Hingurana factory was not in operation for

the third consecutive year due to management problems.

The output of sugar depends on the quantity of cane

crushed and the recovery rate. The cane crushed at Pelwatte

dropped by 10 per cent to 500,000 metric tons, of which

63 per cent private cane purchases were from the allottees

and out growers. Output at Sevanagla improved purely on

account of an increase in the quantity of cane crushed,

which grew by 49 per cent over 1999. Private cane

purchases at Sevanagala were less than 1 per cent of the

total cane crushed.

Overall sugar production for the year dropped, in spite

of a 6 per cent increase in the total quantity of cane

crushed, purely due to poor recovery rates. The sugar

recovery rates at Sevanagala dropped from 8.6 per cent to

8.4 per cent, while at Pelwatte it dropped from 8.8 per cent

to 8.0 per cent, resulting in an overall drop from 8.7 per

cent to 8.2 per cent. Sugar recovery rates achieved in Sri

Lanka are far less than in other sugar producing countries

such as India, where the recovery rates are over 10 per

cent. Farmers prefer to grow the variety Co 775, which is

highly adoptable to Sri Lankan conditions, though it is not

a very high sugar yielding variety. As cane is purchased

on weight basis, cane farmers prefer the cultivation of high

cane yielding varieties at the expense of growing high sugar

yielding varieties.

The average yield of sugar cane at Pelwatta dropped

by 7 per cent to 52 metric tons per ha. although it reported

a significant increase in 1999. The average yield at

Sevanagala, which reported a 3 per cent decline in 1999,

improved by 5 per cent to 83 metric tons per ha. The

average sugar yield levels achieved in Sri Lanka are also

below the levels achieved in other countries in the region.

The yield in Sri Lanka is about 4.7 metric tons per ha

while that of India is 7.2 metric tons per ha.

3.5 Fish and Livestock

Fish

Fish production as estimated by the Ministry of Fisheries

and Aquatic Resources and the National Aquatic Resources

Research and Development Agency (NARA), is reported to

have increased by 4.9 per cent over 1999, to 322,737 metric

tons. The production of coastal fish and aquaculture,

according to the estimates of the Ministry of Fisheries and

Aquatic Resources, reported an 8 per cent increase to

219,980 metric tons. In contrast, the deep sea and off shore

production estimated by NARA reported a 1 per cent

decline to 102,757 metric tons.

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

The marine sector consists of the coastal, deep sea and

off shore sub sectors. This sector accounted for 89 per cent

of total fish production and reported a 3.6 per cent increase

to 286,000 metric tons. The improvement came entirely

from a 6.6 per cent increase in the coastal sector while

output from deep and off shore sectors declined.

Output of the Inland fishery and aquaculture sector,

which accounted for 11 per cent of the total production,

increased significantly by 16.7 per cent compared to 1999.

Growth in this sector is attributed to the increase in the

release of fingerlings to inland reservoirs, as well as

improvements in the aquaculture sector, which recovered

from the white spot and yellow head viral diseases, which

hampered the prawn industry in 1999.

The Ministry identified over 180 rural tanks for

aquaculture development. During the year, 60 tanks were

stocked with fingerlings. Under the aquaculture development

programme, nearly 5 million fingerlings were produced in

2000. Subsidies disbursed under various programmes to the

inland and aquaculture sector, during the year, increased by

15 per cent to Rs.15 million.

Though the country has high potential to develop the

marine fishery sector, a large area of the coastal belt is in

the Northern and Eastern areas where the conditions are not

conducive for fishing at present. Fishing activities are

restricted in those areas due to the unsettled security

situation. To exploit the marine fisheries, the government

is encouraging deep sea fishing by using multiday boats.

During the year, 59-multiday boats were issued under the

producer subsidy scheme. The total fleet of multiday boats

in operation at present is approximately 1,400. In addition

to the multiday boats, 369 traditional crafts and 539 sets

of fishing gear were also given to fishermen under the

subsidy programmes.

During the year the total volume of fresh fish, salted

fish and crustaceans exported more than doubled to

approximately 18,000 metric tons. There is a heavy demand

for skipjack and yellow fin tuna from Japan and this has

resulted in an increase in the price of tuna locally.

The imports of fish, both dried and other, which

includes canned fish, increased during the year. Dry fish

imports increased by 13 per cent to 54,868 metric tons

while other fish imports increased by 32 per cent to 25,655

metric tons.

One of the problems identified in the fisheries sector

is the large-scale post harvest losses through spoilage due

to poor handling. It has been estimated that about 25 per

cent of the catch goes waste due to poor preservation.

Hence, the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources

Development, with the help of the Swedish International

Development Agency (SIDA) organised a pilot project at

the Beruwala fishing harbour on modern methods of fish

handling and preservation for fishermen who use multiday

boats.

Breeding and export of ornamental fresh water fish is

becoming popular. During the year, earnings from exports

of ornamental fish increased by 6 per cent to Rs. 593

million. There is a very high demand for ornamental fish

from Japan, the USA and Europe. Sri Lanka's share in the

export market is very small and there is a potential for

expanding this industry.

Livestock

The livestock sector, consisting mainly of dairy and poultry

products, grew moderately in 2000. According to the

estimates of the Census and Statistics Department, cow milk

and buffalo milk production increased marginally to 263

million litres and 83 million litres, respectively. Domestic

egg production increased by 3 per cent to 923 million eggs

during the year. The poultry sector has been developing

faster than the dairy sector. One of the main reasons for

the faster development of the poultry sector may be the

minimal intervention by the government in this sector. In

the dairy sector, the government still has a high stake,

which acts as a deterrent against large-scale private sector

investment.

During the last few years there has been a gradual decline in the consumption of beef. The consumption of poultry meat has increased, replacing beef as a source of animal protein in the diet, according to the Consumer Finance Surveys conducted by the Central Bank. Poultry meat production increased by about 10 per cent to 62,700 metric tons in 2000 responding to attractive prices, profits and incentives. According to the Ministry of Estate Infrastructure and Livestock Development, production of layer and broiler chicken in 2000 has increased by 11 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively. Concessions granted for the import of equipment such as incubators, feed mills, poultry cages, brooders and feeding systems have helped the development of the poultry sector.

Milk collection by Kiriya Milk Industries of Lanka Pvt.

Ltd., (KMILL), Nestle Lanka Ltd. (NLL), International

5 9

Parti Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2000

Dairy Products Limited (IDPL) and other processors amounted to 92.4 million litres, a 15 per cent decrease compared to 1999. The drop in collection is attributed to the industrial dispute that prevailed in the KMILL and the adverse security situtation that prevailed in the Batticaloa and Valachchenai areas. Milk suppliers benefited from an upward revision of milk purchasing prices by KMILL since September 2000. The purchasing price of milk was increased by 6 per cent to Rs. 14.77 per litre. However, according to the Ministry of Estate Infrastructure and Livestock Development, the price received by producers remained unchanged at Rs. 13.56 per litre in 2000. The average cost of production of milk in 2000 increased by 1 per cent to Rs.5.84 per litre. The Indian National Dairy Development Board, which managed KMILL, had to leave the company in April 2000 and since then, the management has been undertaken by the Sri Lankan government. During 2000, milk and milk product imports increased by 6 per cent to 61, 194 metric tons valued at Rs.8,945 million.

The Council for Agricultural Research and Policy (CARP) has identified a few major constraints to dairy development in the country such as lack of pasture and fodder, marketing of milk, breeding, veterinary services and lack of properly constructed cattle sheds. To improve the veterinary facilities and extension services, 65 new Veterinary Officers (VOs) were recruited during the year. A special dairy development project was introduced in 2000, with a view to revitalising the dairy sector in up-country estates. The project period is 3 years and will initially be implemented in five estates on a pilot basis. The objective of the project is to increase milk production in estates by improving the management of existing dairy cattle and by increasing the dairy cattle population in the estates. Nearly 600 estate worker families will directly benefit from this project.

3.6 Inputs

Fertiliser

During 2000, the use of fertiliser declined by 5 per cent to 589,000 metric tons. The decline was mainly in the usage of fertiliser for paddy and coconut. Fertiliser application in paddy during Yala 2000, declined as a result of a reduction in the extent cultivated, as well as drop in the quantity applied per hectare. Fertiliser usage in paddy accounts for a major share of fertiliser used. As a result of low paddy prices that prevailed after the Maha harvest in 2000, the use of fertiliser decreased. The share of fertiliser issues to paddy, which stood at 56 per cent during

1999, decreased to 44 per cent in 2000. Fertiliser issues to the coconut sector also declined by 5 per cent in response to the decline in coconut prices. Fertiliser issues for other field crops and minor export crops sector also dropped. The attractive tea price that prevailed during the year encouraged

the application of fertiliser for tea, leading to an increase

of 21 per cent.

The fertiliser subsidy, confined to urea since 1997, continued during the year. Urea is sold to the farmers at a price of Rs 350 per 50 kg bag. In response to fluctuations of fertiliser prices in the world market and the depreciation of the rupee, the fertiliser subsidy rate were revised several times during the year. The total expenditure on the fertiliser subsidy payment exceeded the initial budgetary allocation of Rs.1,500 million and amounted to Rs.1,733 million in 2000.

Seed

Encouragement provided to the private sector to participate

actively in the production and sale of quality seeds were

further strengthened during the year. The government

handed over a part of the Pelwehera seed farm of the DOA

to a private sector seed producing institution. The institution

has commenced developing the centre to a seed and modem

equipment sales cum demonstration centre for high

technology agriculture.

In addition to the private sector and government seed farms, provincial councils, the Mahaweli Authority and co­operative societies are also engaged in the production of

seed paddy. The highest ever seed paddy production (13,000

metric tons) in the last decade was in 2000. Of the total

seed paddy production, the private sector accounted for 45

per cent, while the cooperative sector and the public sector

accounted for 34 per cent and 21 per cent, respectively.

Some of the large-scale private sector seed paddy

producers are of the view that the seed paddy produced on

government farms are priced below the cost of production.

Seed paddy prices in the government sector have not been

revised since 1997. The private seed producers allege that

fixing the price of seed paddy at artificially low prices is

acting as a deterrent to the development of the seed

industry.

Agro-chemicals

According to provisional estimates of the Registrar of

Pesticide the use of pesticides, which includes insecticides,

fungicides and herbicides, decreased by 15 per cent during

the year. A relatively higher drop of 28 per cent was

reported in the use of insecticides.

The Department of Agriculture continued its Integrated

Pest Management Programme (IPM) in 2000, to reduce the

use of pesticides and thereby the cost of cultivation. During

the cultivation year, approximately 54,000 farmers adopted

the IPM package under the 'Yaya' Demonstration

Programme covering an extent of 46,000 ha.

3.7 Forestry

The Forest Department (FD) carried out several projects for forestry related activities with special emphasis on conservation and environment management, with the assistance of foreign donor agencies. In line with the Forestry Sector Master Plan, the Forest Resource Management Project (FRMP) was implemented in 2000. The Project is funded by the ADB, and Rs 1.7 million was provided under the Project in 2000. Survey and demarcation of state forests, awareness programmes on forest conservation, commencement of the restructuring of the Forest Department architectural consultancy work and commencement of the revision of the Forest Ordinance were the activities carried out under this Project.

ADB provided Rs 60 million for the implementation of the Participatory Forestry Project and Rs 33.4 million for the Upper Watershed Management Project in 2000. Activities such as buffer zone enrichment, maintenance of buffer zone planting, homestead development, stream reservation planting, planting in public places and private lands, and maintenance of timber farms and nursery programme were carried out under that Project. During the year, Rs 2 million was spent under the World Bank funded Medicinal Plant Project. Under that Project, medicinal

plantations were established and maintained in Matale,

Ritigala, Balangoda and Bibile. The United Nations

Development Programme (UNDP) funded the Global

Environmental Facility Project to procure equipment and to

carry out awareness programmes in 2000.

Under forest inventory and management activities, 1,265 hectares of forest plantations were surveyed and five resin tapping leasing agreements related to 5,380 hectares of pine plantations were continued during 2000. Further, silvicultural treatment including thinning, pruning, weeding, application of fertiliser, application of fungicides and insecticides were carried out in respect of 5,900 hectares of forest plantations. Under forestry extension, 2 million seedlings were raised for tree planting programmes and 6,700 kg of seeds were collected for nursery programmes in 2000.

The FD continued to monitor the implementation of regulations relating to the transport of timber and carried out surveillance checks to restrict illegal deforestation in 2000. New regulations on timber depot registration were formulated and four Gazette notifications were issued in 2000. The volume of illicitly felled timber increased substantially to 5,662 cubic meters from 2,912 cubic meters and the recorded number of forest offences too rose to 4,626 in 2000 from 3,928 in 1999, reflecting a need for the intensification of surveillance activities on felling.

The State Timber Corporation, which is the major supplier of timber, recorded significant improvements in 2000. The total output of logs, sawn timber and firewood of the Corporation during 2000 amounted to 277,695 cubic meters, a 40 per cent increase compared to 1999, due to increased tree felling activities on both state and private lands.
