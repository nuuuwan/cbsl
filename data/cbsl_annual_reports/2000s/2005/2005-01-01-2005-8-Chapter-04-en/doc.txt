PRICES, WAGES AND EMPLOYMENT

4.1 OverviewI The rate of price increases began to decelerate in 2fi)5, fromthat witnessed since early 2004, benefiting fromimprovements in domestic production and tightening ofmonetary policy, with stability in the exchange rate. Theyear 2005 saw annual average inflation revert to a decliningtrend.r However, the year ended at a higher rate than in theprevious year, at ll.6 per cent on the Colombo Consumershice Index (CCPI) and at 10.6 per cent on the countrywide SriI-ankaConsumers' hice Index (SLCPD, compared with 7.6percent and 7.9 per cent, respectively, at end 20[/. The point-to-point inflation declined throughout the yearon all price indices.2However, point-to-point increases were significantly higherduring the first half of 2005 compared to rhe first half of 2004. I

Consequently, the annual average inflation rose in the frrst threequarters before declining thereafter. Measures of inflation indifferent regions of the country also showed similar patterns.. Domestic as well as external demand and supply factorsimpacted on the observed price changes at both wholesale

and retail market levels. On the supply side, while production

of goods and services increased, highercosts of production andtransportation and upward adjustments in administered prices

of inputs such as fuel contributed to price increases. The adverseeffects of the drought that occurred in the previous yearcontinued to exert pressure on prices of some domesticallyproduced agricultural commodities during the first half of the

year. The impact of the tsunami that occurred on 26 Decernber2004 also affected prices adversely. However, expansion inagricultural production, particularly of paddy, reduced the

pressure on prices after the fint quarter of the year. The pressure

on prices from the demand side was reflected in the relativelyhigh expansion of monetary and credit aggregates, particularly

consumption credit, throughout the year, while tightening themonetary policy stance helped to contain inflationaryexpectations during 2005.

Price movements of imported consumer goods were mixed.Most major consumer imports, such as rice, sugar and milk

powder, experienced price increases in US dollarterms. Amongmajor intermediate imports, international prices of crude oil

were volatile at relatively higher levels throughout the year dueto a continuous increase in demand and supply side

disturbances. However, the full impact of such increases wasnot passed on to domestic prices. In contrast, wheat grainregistered lower international prices compared with 2004.Meanwhile, marginal variations during most of the year of the

rupee against the US dollar, the main transaction currency, kept

the exchange rate impact on import prices low.

Efforts to reduce the impact of the rising cost of importsthrough administrative measures helped keep pricepressure low to a certain extent. Removal of the value addedtax (VAT) on a few selected key items (diesel, Liquefied

Petroleum Gas (LPG) and milk powder), together with limited

adjustments to domestic prices of petroleum products at below

the rising costs of production, provided temporary relief to

consumers by containing their prices to a certain extent.o Public sector wages increased in real terms in 2005 due towage revisions in late 2004, while private sector wagescontractd in real terms. The nominal wage increases for non-executive categories in the public sector, when adjusted forinflation, ranged between 14 and l8 per cent. These wage

adjustments had a contagion effect on wage increases in the

private sector, through the new Budgetary Relief Allowance of

Workers Act (BRAWA). Wages in the informalprivate sectorand minimum wages in the formal private sector rose innominal terms, though such increases were not sufficient to

compensate for inflation. These wage increases could also have

exerted some pressure on consumer prices through increased

demand.

The unemployment rate declinedtoT.T per cent by August

2005 from 83 per cent in 20M. The expansion in economicactivities and implementation of the graduate employmentprogramme of the government contributed to reduce

unemployment. The post-tsunamirecovery in the hotels, fishing

and small and medium industry sub sectors in affected coastal

areas and construction sector growth, also partly due to tsunami

reconstruction work, helped generate employment opportunities

throughout 2005.

The shifts in employment across economic sectors from20Mto 2ffi5 indicated that labour mobility had improved.The employment share in agriculture had declined despite

expansion in agricultural production. Agricultural labour was

absorbed by the construction and manufacturing sectors, among

others, and linked to expansion of economic activities in those

sectors.

Foreign employment placements increased by 8.2 per cent

in 2005 compared to200./.. The share of males in total foreign

employment placements rose compared with the previous year.Meanwhile, the share of housemaids among manpower

categories, remained high. The demand for labour in 2005 was

mainly from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

o Certain labour laws were amended and enacted as new actsin Parliament and the coverage of collective agreements inthe plantation sector was extended in 2005 towardsfacilitating the smooth functioning of the labour market.The number of strikes in the plantation sector declined

significantly in 2005 compared to2004, probably indicating

improved relationships between employers and employees

arising from collective bargaining under wage agreements.

4.2 Prices

Consumer Price Indices (CPls)o All CPIs recorded annual average inflation rates in a range

of around 7 tol2 per cent by the end of the year, comparedto 5 to 8 per cent in the previous year. Inflation rates rose

continuously from early 2004 until mid-2005 and declined

gradually thereafter, indicating the easing of inflation towards

the end of the year. This was indicated by the point-to-point

changes, which began falling during the first quarter and

continued on a downward trend over the remainder of the year.

However, these changes were hrgher in the first half of the year

compared to the conesponding changes in the previous year.

The situation changed during the second half of the year,

especially since the third quarter for most CPIs, with lower

point-to-point changes than the previous year indicating the

easing of price pressure towards the year-end.r Price movements of both domestic goods and importsinfluenced CPI movements. In the CCPI, domestically

produced goods represcnt about 78 per cent, while the balance

of about 22 per cent is represented by imports. In both groupsfood items dominate. The compositions of other CPIs are

similar. Accordingly, the observed movements of CPIs were

mainly driven by changes in food prices. The point-to-point

increases of the food sub indices followed a pattem similar to

that of the rcspective overall CPIs during the year. Meanwhile,

the persistent increase of prices in the fuel and light sub group

with shares of around 4to6percent of the total weights acrossall CPIs contributed to the movements in the point-to-point

changes as well as the annual average inflation on all CPIs.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 200559

Part IChapter 4 - PRICES, WAGES AND EMPLOYMENT

The increasing trend in the annual average inflation of theColombo Consumers' Price Index (CCPI), the official

measure of the cost of living, continued until August 2005,to reach 12.8 per cent, and began to decline slowlythereafter, to reach 11.6 per cent hy the end ofthe year. The

food sub index, which represents the highest share of around 62

per cent of the CCPI basket, followed a similar pattern, whereasthe other sub indices of clothing, fuel and light and

miscellaneous items showed increasing trends throughout the

year, Annual average inflation in the fuel and light sub index,which measures the movement of price levels of kerosene,

firewood, matches and electricity, with a weight of 4.3 per centin the CCPI basket, was 13.5 per cent by the end of the year.

Among the items in the miscellaneous items sub group, the

upward price revisions of transport related goods and services,

increases in tobacco and liquor prices and tuition fees and

stationery prices contributed to the annual average inflation of

the miscellaneous items sub index which reached l0 per cent

by Decemberfrom 6.5 percent in January 2005. The movement

of this sub index too, impacted on the movements of the CCPI,

as it represents the second highest share of around 18 per cent

in the CCPI basket.

The Sri Lanka Consumers'Price Index (SLCPD showed asimilar pattern, but the intensities in changes were higherin comparison to the CCPL The SLCPI has a more recent

consumption basket (base year 1995197), as well as a more

representative reference population of the lowest 80 per cent of

expenditure groups in the entire country excluding only theNorthern and Eastern provinces, The rate of annual averageinflation continued to rise to reach a peak of I4.5 per cent inJuly and began to fall thereafter, to reach 10.6 per cent by the

end of the year. These compare with changes in rates ofinflation between l.2per cent and 7.9 per cent in the previousyear. The main driving force was the food, beverages and

tobacco sub index with a share of around 7I per cent in the

SLCPI basket, for which the annual average change varied

between l0.land 16.8 per cent in 2005 compared to a range of

- I to 8.6 per cent in the previous year. The continuous increasein crude oil prices in the international market and the

consequent upward revision of domestic fuel prices led to an

increase in price levels in the transport and housing, water,

electricity, gas and other fuels sub groups. The annual average

change in the transport sub index rose to 17.0 per cent by the

end of the year, compared to 10.8 per cent in the previous year.

The rate of inflation in the housing, water, electricity, gas and

other fuels sub index, having a weight of around l3 per cent,

was 14.6 per cent in 2005 compared to 5.8 per cent in 20M.Price increases of construction materials and the upward

revision of the unit price of water, in addition to the fuel and gas

price increases, contributed to the higher inflation in the sub

index. Price increases of construction materials were evident

from the increased values in the All-Construction Indexcompiled by the Institute for Construction, Training andDevelopment (ICTAD). Among the other sub indices in theSLCPI, the health, education and miscellaneous goods andservices sub indices showed increasing trends in inflation

during the year, while the clothing and footwear sub index, with

a re lative share of 4 per cent, increased by less than 4 per cent

compared to the increase of around 5 per cent in the previous

year. Although the sub index for leisure, entertainment andculture increased significantly by 17.5 per cent in 2005, the

impact on overall inflation was marginal, since this group has

a weight of less than I per cent in the SLCPI basket.

Regional Price Indiceso All regional price indices followed the observed general

behaviour of annual average inflation as measured by theCCPI and SLCPI. In addition to the CCPI and SLCPI, the

Central Bank of Sri Lanka measures regional inflation ttroughthe movements of CPIs it compiles for the districts of

Anuradhapura (APCPI), Colombo (CDCPI), Matale (MLCPI),

and Matara (MRCPI). The point-to-point changes differed

marginally among districts compared to the CCPI, reflecting the

differences in weight structures, which represent the differencesin consumption patterns among households in those districts,

and variations in pnce movements among different regions of

the country. The point-to-point changes indicated similar trends

and were significantly higher in the first six months and much

lower in the second six months, compared to the conesponding

months of the previous year. However, all four district CPIs

recorded lower inflation than the SLCPI and CCPI for most of

the year. They registered annual average inflation rates belowl0 per cent by the end of the year, while the inflation in the

Colombo Municipality area (CCPI) and the country as a whole(SLCPI) recorded inflation rates greater than 10 per cent. The

lowest point-to-point as well as annual average increase was

recorded by the MRCPI, with declines in the monthly changesfor seven months of the year. The recovery of the agriculture

sector, especially the low prices of rice which has a high sharein the MRCPI basket, would have contributed to the lower

inflation registered in this district.o Although the inflation rates in Anuradhapura, Matale andMatara districts were higher compared to the Colombodistrict by the end of the previous year, the rates had

converged to a greater extent by 2fi)5, with Anuradhapura

and Matara districts recording even lower inflation rates

than Colombo, The greater availability of the main agricultural

products at relatively lower prices in those producing districts,unlike in the Colombo district, would have contributed to the

observed faster decline in inflation in these ttree districts during

the year. Among such items, the drop in paddy price was

significant. The low paddy production and higher dependency

60Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2005

Part IChapter 4 - PRICES, WAGES AND EMPLOYMENT

on rice imports of about 221,663 MTs and the added transport

costs for distribution out of Colombo influenced the increase

in the regionalCPls and SLCPI compared to the CDCPI in the

previous year. In contrast, the increased paddy production in

these regions, and consequent low price levels recorded for rice,which has a significant share in the regional CPI baskets,

contributed to the above developments in 2005.

Wholesale Price Index (WPl). Movements of the WPI, both in 2004 and 2005, preceded

the price developments at retail level. The movements in the

CPIs show that the WPI acts as a leading indicator for futureretail price changes. For instance, the behaviour of the WPI,which began to increase somewhat earlier in February 2004,

and continued rising until June 2005, is reflected later in the

increasing trend of annual average inflation as measur€d by theCPIs, that commenced in the second quarter of 2004 and

continued until August 2005. The annual average inflation on

the food sub index, which represents around 68 per cent of theWPI basket, varied within a range of about l0 per cent to 22

per cent and followed a similar trend to the overall index. Thepoint-to-point change in the WPI was higher than in all CPIs

at the beginning ofthe year, but fell sharply to 2 per cent by endof the year, which confirmed the movements of retail prices

reflected in all the CPIs.I Price increases for certain key intermediate and investmentgoods influenced the behaviour of the corresponding sub-indices. The petroleum products sub index that has the second

highest wei-Qht of around 6 per cent, recorded an inflation rate

of 23 pr cent in 2005, compared to the inflation of 15 per cent

for 2004, consequent to the increase in crude oil prices in theintemational market and subsequent adjustments in domesticfuel prices. The increase in prices of most building materials,particularly cement, bricks, sheet glass and roof tiles, wasevident in the movements of the non-metallic products sub

index. The point-to-point increase in the sub index reached a

peak of about 69 per cent in June 2005 compared to the 6 per

cent increase in the same month of the previous year. Every

month of 2005 recorded a more than 30 per cent increase in thissub-index on point-to-point basis. Accordingly, the annual

average increase in the non-metallic products sub index reached

45 per cent in 2005, in comparison to 16 per cent recorded for2004.In addition to the higher import costs and input costs of

domestic production, the higher transpott charges for building

materials too contributed to this increase. Prices of textiles and

footwear remained fairly stable at the previous year's level, as

indicated by the movements of the WPI sub index, and a similar

change was observed in the respective CPI sub indices as well.Annual inflation on the transport equipment sub index was

about 14 per cent, compared to around 6 per cent in the previous

year, The combined effects of price developments in transpoft

equipment and petroleum products were evident in the increase

of the transport sub indices on all CPIs.

Under the classiflrcation on the basis of the origin of goods,

the import and export group sub-indices registered higher

increases than the domestic group. The domestic group,

representing a share greater than 50 per cent and dominated by

food items, registered an annual average price increase of

around 7 per cent, which was lower than the l0 per cent increase

in the previous year. This indicated the possibility of a slight

reduction in the retail price level of domestic goods in the early

months of 2006, than experienced in the conesponding months

of 2005. The imports sub group, with a weight of around 27 per

cent in the WPI basket, registered a higher price increase of

around 18 per cent compared to l0 per cent in the previous year.

The higher intemational prices of intermediate imports such aspetroleum products, LPG and fertiliser, were the main

contributory factors to the increase in the imports sub index.

The exports sub group, having a weight of 22 per cent in the

WPI basket, recorded an annual average inflation of around 12

per cent in 2005. The increase in prices for the export group was

mainly driven by the attractive prices for tea with a weight of

about l l per cent in the WPI basket. The export prices of mid-

grown and low-grown teas increased by about 3 per cent and 5

per cent, respectively over the year due to their high quality.

Price increases for natural rubber by about I I per cent in the

international market, as a result of high international prices for

synthetic rubber, too contributed to the annual average inflation

in the export group sub index.

Under the classification of usage, all three sub-indices

recorded increases, while the investment goods sub-index

recorded the highest rate. The consumer goods sub index,

dominated by food items and having a share of more than 75

per cent in the WPI expenditure basket, rose by about l0 per

cent over the year. The 12 month average increases were

signihcantly higher for months in the first half of the year. In

contrast, declines were recorded in the corresponding months

of the first half 20M. This was mainly due to the increases in

producer prices for most food items that commenced in the

second half of the previous year and continued during the first

few months of 2005, as well. The investment goods sub index

too recorded a significantly high rate of inflation of about 36 per

cent. Significant price increases of building construction

materials within a range of 4-58 per cent, compared to the 1-8

per cent increase in 2004, were mainly responsible for this

increase. There was an increase of around I I per cent for

intermediate goods following an l8 per cent increase in 2004.

GDP Deflator. The GDP deflator, which measures the price changes of all

goods produced in the economy, increased by 9.9 per centcompared to the 9.3 per cent increase in 2fi)4. The services

sector registered a significant increase of l0 per cent compared

61Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 200s

Part IChapter 4 - PRICES, WAGES AND EMPLOYMENT

to 8,8 per cent in the previous year. All four sub indices under

the services sector increased though at different rates within a

ran-qe of 5.3 per cent to 23.4 per cent during the year, in the

wake of higher utility, transport and other input costs. The

increase recorded for the industry sector (9.0 per cent) was

lower than in the previous year (l1.0 per cent). While three sub

indices under the industry sector recorded moderate increasesin 2005, the significant increase of 14,1 per cent in the

construction sub index was the major contributory factor to the

overall increase, which was evident in the higher import prices

of building materials as well as the increase in the non-metallic

products sub index in the WPL The agriculture sector registereda 10.9 per cent increase, higher than in the previous year.Although the sub indices of coconut, rubber, forestry and

fishing recorded increases of 25.8 per cent, 14.5 per cent, 18. Iper cent and 10.4 per cent, respectively, the paddy sub index

declined by 5 per cent in contrast to the 29.7 per cent increasein the previous year. The 'other' agriculture sub sector, whichcovers all other crops in domestic agriculture and animalhusbandry, recorded an increase of I I .7 per cent over theprevious year. Despite the growth in most sub-sectors of

agricultural production that benefited from favourable weather,

higher industrial demand and input prices contributed to the

recorded increases in those sub indices. The increase in the

fishing sub index was driven by low fish production relative to

pre-tsunami levels and the subsequent post-tsunamirecovery in

demand.

Price Movements. While prices of most domestically produced goods and

services, as well as imported goods increased, prices of key

items such as rice and wheat grain, among others, decreasedduring the year compared with prices of the previous year.

Prices of rice, a significant consumer item, dropped within a

range of 5 to l0 per cent during 2005, in contrast to increaseswithin a broad range of 16 to 28 per cent in 2004. The

significant growth in paddy production in both Maha (21 per

cent) and Yala (29 per cent) seasons was due to favourableweather conditions and an increase in extent under paddycultivation. This was the main contributory factor to the

observed price decline. The imporr prices of rice, in US dollar

terms too, declined by around 9 per cent during the first half of

the year, though they rose sharply during the second half by

around 38 per cent, resulting in around l3 per cent net increasein the price of imported rice over the previous year. Rice

imports, however, declined by about 77 per cent in 2005 and

amounted to only 3 per cent of the total supply, in comparison

to l2 per cent in 2004. Accordingly, increased higher domesticproduction was the driving factor behind declining rice prices.

The domestic retail prices of sugar, a key consumer itemwith a share of between 3 to 6 per cent in all CPIs, rose byabout 12 per cent compared to the 9 per cent rise in 2(M.

In contrast to the situation for rice, sugar prices were driven byrising intemational prices due to the higher demand arising fromits use as a biofuel internationally. The average price ofimported sugar, which amounted to about 89 per cent of total

supply, increased in US dollars terms by 26 per cent in 2005

over 2004. There was also a decline in domestic production of

sugar by about 7 per cent due to a drop in sugar cane productionby about 2 per cent and labour disputes. Hence, the share ofdomestic production in total sugar supply fell from 15 per cent

in 2004 to around I I per cent in 2005.

Prices of coconut increased following the decline inproduction, while prices of pulses rose, despite production

increases. The prices of coconut, that has a significant share

in the average consumption basket, rose by about 31 per cent

over the price levels in 2004. This contrasts with a drop in

prices by about 1.5 per cent in 2004. During the first half of

2005, coconut prices increased significantly, by about 6l per

cent, compared to the first half of the previous year, reflecting

the drop in production by about I I per cent due to the lagged

effect of drought. However, this was mitigated by the decline

in prices by 2l per cent during the second half compared to thefirst half owing to the gradual increase in production. Import

prices of red dhal, another important consumer item, increasedby around l0 per cent in 2005, resulting in a domestic priceincrease of about I I per cent over the previous year. All

varieties of pulses registered price increases within a range of3 to 3l per cent in 2005, despite the increases in domestic

production.

Prices of vegetables, tubers and fruits rose, even thoughtheir production expanded. Prices of all varieties of

vegetables, which are mostly domestically produced, rose in

2005 over the previous year despite increases in production.This was diff'erent to the mixed trends recorded in 2004.

However, there were mixed trends in the quarterly changes in

prices durin-e the first three quarters of the year, as reflectedby the -22 to 17 per cent range for these quarters over the

previous respective quarters. Meanwhile, in the fourth quarter,

prices of almost all varieties of vegetables increased within a

range of around I to 13 per cent compared to the third quarter,

due to the seasonal slump in production aggravated by high

rainfall during the months of November and December. Pricesof both local and imported potatoes increased by about 9 per

cent over the previous year. hices of red onions and big onions(local) increased by about l3 per cent and I I per cent during

2005 compared to the price increases of 5 per cent and l3 per

cent, respectively, in the previous year. Although production

increased, the lower supply situation due to spoilage as a resultof rains at the end of the year contributed to the significantprice increase during the fourth quarter, thereby resulting in

the overall annual increase. The domestic retail prices of big

onion remained high, despite the decline in the import priceby about 9 per cent, mainly due to relatively lower imports

during the year. All varieties of domestically produced fresh

fruits recorded price increases at different rates within a range

of 2 to 38 per cent, compared to the range of -l I to 9 per cent

registered in 20M, despite increases in production for most

key varieties.r Prices of hsh, meat and dairy products experienced price

increases at differing rates (8-33 per cent) in 2005. Pricesof these protein sources were higher throughout the year

compared to the previous year, a phenomenon observed in the

last few years as well. Although sea fish prices were low during

the first two months due to the low demand that prevailed in the

' aftermath of the tsunami, prices recovered to pre{sunami levels

by the end of the quarter, despite the drastic drop in productionby 77.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2005. The quarterly

changes in sea fish prices ranged from -1.5 per cent in the first

quarter to I I per cent in the fourth quarter of the year comparedto the conespondin-e quarters of the previous year. Although

fish production was low throughout the year due to the tsunami

impact, average price increases of fish were fairly low, in a

range of 8 per cent to 13 per cent in 2005. This was attributedto the lower prices registered in the Northern province,

compared to prices elsewhere in the country. Inland frsh prices

registered a reversed quarterly trend: 45 per cent increase in thefirst quarter and 28 per cent increase in the fourth quarter,

reflecting the substitution effect between the two sources offish. Prices of eggs rose by about 32 per cent compared to the

5 per cent rise in the previous year. The highest increase, about

53 per cent, was registered during the first quarter over the fint

quarter of 20M, reflecting the shift from sea fish consumption

due to the tsunami. Prices rose by over 15 per cent for all

varieties of meat and prices of milk powder increased in the

international market by about l3 per cent in US dollar terms.

Prices of other milk based imported products too increasedduring the year. The increasing demand for food items with

high protein and nutrition content as a result of rising living

standards and the rising costs of inputs of production and of

transport, would have contributed to these price developments

during the year.e The import prices of certain key consumer items such asdried chillies, big onion, wheat grain and wheat flour

decreased, whereas other intermediate and investment

goods imports that affect consumer goods directly, as well

as indirectly, registered price increases. Among these

intermediate imports, the price of crude oil, the most important

intermediate impoft, increased on average, by 4l per cent to USdollars 53 per banel compared to 38 per banel in 2004. The

respective increases were 28 per cent and l7 per cent in2004

and 2003. The highest increase was in the month of April by

about 50 per cent. Accordingly, domestic prices of petroleum

products, diesel, petrol, kerosene and furnace oil, were revisedupward twice during the year in response to changing

international prices. The increases in kerosene, petrol and diesel

prices were evident from the increase in the fuel and light sub

index and the increase in transport expenditure in all available

Consumer Pnce Indices (CPIs). The average domestic price ofLPG increased by 26 per cent, in response to a 27 per cent

increase in US dollar terms of the import price. This had a

significant impact on the prices of prepared foods. On average,

the US dollar price of a metric ton of fertiliser too increased by

about 2l per cent over the year. Investment goods imports

prices too, notably building materials, increased within a range

of 4 to 20per cent in 2W5, as a-qainst increases of I to 8 per centin the previous year. These increases in intermediate and

investment goods import prices adversely impacted on overall

price developments durin-q the year.

Provincial Price Variationss Variations in prices of goods among provinces exist due to

a number of factors related to demand, supply and quality.

The supply side factors depend on the area under production,

productivity improvements, improved efflciency in distribution

channels and the availability of timely market information. The

provincial variations of retail prices between 20M and 2005

were compared fbl selected commodities using a statistical

Source : Cenlral Bank of Sri Lanka

measure, namely, the Coefficient of Variation (CV). This

measured the variability of average prices across the provinces

relative to the national average.3

The price variations for perishable items were relatively

high. CVs for most varieties of vegetables were high. The CVs

for low country vegetables were higher compared to the CVs

for up country vegetables. The CVs for most varieties of fresh

fish, another highly perishable item, were also relatively higher

owing to the infrastructure in the fisheries sector being badly

damaged by the tsunami. As a consequence of the destructionof refrigeration and storage facilities, and more difficult

transporl access, especially to the Northem and Eastern coastal

areas, distribution of the supply of fish, in excess of limited

local demand in those areas, may have been difficult. This

would have led to downward pressure on prices. The prices in

the Northern province were si-enificantly lower than prices inother provinces. This contributed to the observed high

variations in fish prices across the provinces.

Price variations of food items with a relatively longer shelf

life remained relatively low across provinces. The estimated

variation in prices for all varieties of rice was below 7 per cent.

CVs of red onions and eggs had narrowed compared to the

previous year, although price levels remained high. However,

with the rise and fall in prices during the year, the variability

in prices of coconut had increased, where the estimated CV was

about 8 per cent in 2005, as a-eainst around 5 per cent in the

prevlous year.

3 The Coellicient of Variation (CV) is a statistical measure that measures thevariability of the values ol a given item relalive lo its average value (i.e. (standard

deviation/mean ).100). Accordingly, a lower CV indicates less variability and viceversa.

4.3 Wages

Public Sector. In 2005, as in 2004, public sector employees were able toenjoy significant wage increases as a result of theimplementation of the second salary revision of 2004

effective from 0l December 20041 Public sector wa-qes and

salaries are fixed by the state and revisions to these wages are

made from time to time. The December 2004 revision granted

a 40 per cent increase of the basic salary subject to a minimumof Rs.3,250 per month and a maximum of Rs.9,000 per month,

plus allowances. The new salary scales were to be implemented

in two stages: Rs.2,500 or 50 per cent of the proposed increase,whichever was hi*eher, was effective from December 2004, and

the balance fr<lm January 2006, subject to the recommendationsof the National Council for Administration. As a result of thefirst salary increase, wage indices of non-executive officers,

minor employees and government school-teachers rose by 28per cent, 3l per cent and 27 per cent, respectively, in 2005 innominal terms compared to 2004. Accordingly, the overall

nominal wa-qe rate index for government employees increasedby around 29 per cent.e When nominal increases of government employeest wages

were adjusted for CPI inflation, their real wage increases

were in a range of 14 per cent to 18 per cent. Overall, minor

employees received the highest percentage increases in real

wages among all three categories. These wage increases weresimilar to those in the previous year. Consequently, despitehigh inflation, public sector employees, on avera-ge, enjoyed

similar, real wage increases in both 20M and 2005.

Formal Private Sectoro In parallel to the increase in public sector salaries under theBudget Proposals 2005,a new Budgetary Relief Allowance

of Workers Act (2ffi5) was enactd in Parliament with effectfrom I August 2005 to increase private sector salaries by Rs.

1,000. This Act enables the government to protect pnvate sector

4 The public sector consists of two sub sectors, namely, government (central,provincial, and local govemment sectors) and semi-govemment (state corporations,statuary boards and state authorities).

employees from the rising cost of living, Wa,ees in the formal

private sector are influenced by wage increases announced by

the govemment, as well as individualcontracts of employment,

collective agreements, unilateral decisions by employers and

minimum wage decisions of Wages Boards.s The impact of the

mandated increase under the above Act on minimum wase

indices in the formal private sector was limited.c Nominal minimum wages in the three major sectors in the

formal private sector, A griculture, Industry and commerce,

and Services, increased by 9 per cent,3 per cent and 4 per

cent, respectively in 2ffi5. Accordingly, the overall nominalminimum wage rate index compiled by the Department of

Labour for Wages Boards Trades for these sectors increased by

around 8 per cent. Employees in all three sectors suffered a loss

in their minimum real wages. Employees in the service sector,

the only sector, which enjoyed a real minimum wage increasein 2004, suffered the greatest loss in 2005. Employees in

Industry and commerce suffered greater losses compared to

20M. Though employees in agriculture suffered a loss, it was

f ess than in 2ffi4 and the overall loss in 2005. In the context

of high inflation in both 2004 and 2005, the increases in

minimum wage rates were inadequate to ensure maintenance of

minimum real wages in both years, on average. However, since

the minimum wage indices do not cover all payments and

wages earned by managerial and professional categories in

these sectors, the overall actual situation could be different to

that reflected in these minimum wage indices.

Informal Private Sectort The information on informal sector daily wages collected

under the Country WideData Collection System (CWDCS)

of the Central Bank, which covers the agriculture andconstruction sectors, revealed relatively low changes in

wage rates. Nominal wages in the informal private sectorare

determined in a free market environment.6 They are influenced

by various factors such as the rising cost of living, prevailing

market conditions, the degree of labour intensity and skills

required in their work and alternative opportunities to shift work

among different activities and regions. Nominal daily wage

changes in the Agriculture sector varied from -l per cent to 6

6 The informal privale sector comprises all employees that fall outside the public

sector and formal private sector.

percent during 2005. Wa_ees in the construction sector increasedwithin a range of 4 to 9 per cent.

Within the agriculture sector, except in the tea sector, allother sectors recorded marginal increases in nominal

wages. Wages for plucking and maintenance activity (buildin_e

bunds, di-e-ein,e ditches, fixing pegs, manuring and bending

plants) in the tea sector increased, while those for replanting(preparation of land, digging pits, closing pits and planting)

decreased. As a result, overall, the tea sector recorded a

marginal decrease in nominal wages. Consequently, realwagesin the agricultural sector dropped between 6 to l3 per cent

compared to changes within a range of -0.7 to 6 per cent in the

previous year.

In 2005, demand for construction sector workers rose asconstruction sector activities expanded. This was highlighted

by the increases in consumption of cement and other buildingmaterials and an increase in loans from banks for housing

projects. As a result, wages for construction sector workers

recorded increases in nominal terms. Master carpenters and

master masons recorded higher nominal wage increases thanskilled and unskilled helpers during year. However, all

categories in the construction sector suffered losses in real

wages. When adjusted for inflation in 2005, real wages in the

construction sector varied within a range of -8 per cent to - 3

per cent.

4.4 Population, Labour Force andEmployment

Population* According to the Registrar General's Department (RGD)

the estimated mid year population of 2005 was 19.7 million.This was a growth of Ll percent over the previous year. The

population growth rates of all three age categories, (below l5

years, 15-54 years, and 55 years and above) were similar to the

growth rate of the mid year population. All districts contributed

to the expansion in population, except Mullaitivu district. High

increases in population were recorded in Colombo, Kandy,Kurunegala, Gampaha and Badulla districts. Colombo,

Gampaha and Kurunegalacontinued to absorb 30 percent of the

total population. There was a contraction in the population inMullaitivu district by 2.1per cent in 2005, partly due to out-migration from the coastal areas following the Tsunamidevastation. This contraction may have influenced the

population growth in the neighbouring districts of Kilinochchi

and Vavuniya in the same province.

Labour Force. The labour force, the sum of employed and unemployedpersons, is estimated by the Quarterly Labour ForceSurvey (QLFS) conducted by the Department of Censusand Statistics (DCS). However, owing to the tsunami, the

DCS could not conduct the QLFS quarterly in 2005 due to the

absence of a sample frame in the tsunami-affected areas of the

country and involvement of DCS officers in tsunami related

surveys in the first half of 2005. Instead, with the availabilityof a new sample frame by mid 2005, the DCS conducted one

Special Labour Force Survey (SLFS), which covered the entirecountry, in August 2005. The SLFS consisted of 4,300

households from non-tsunami areas and 1.050 households from

tsunami affected areas, in comparison to the QLFS, which

sampled around 4,000 households in each quarter of the year.o According to the SLFS, the labour force, which is defined

as persons who are aged 10 years and above, and able andwilling to work, increased to 8.14 million persons in August

2005 compared to 7.9E million persons in the third quarter

2004.1In 2005, the increase in the labour force was moderatecompared to 2003 and2004, in which years the sample

coverage expanded through the inclusion of the Eastern and

Northern provinces, respectively. Further, the loss of lives due

to the tsunami devastation at the end of 2004 also restricted the

increase in the labour force in 2005. The labour force consisted

of 7.52 million employed persons nd0,62 million unemployed

persons in 2005.o The labour force participation rate (LFPR)8, increased to

48.3 per cent in August 2005 from 47.9per cent in the thirdquarter 2004. This increase was mainly due to the increase in

male LFPR to 67.1 per cent from 65.7 per cent in the third

quarter of 2004. Meanwhile, the marginal decline in female

LFPR over the same period had a dampening impact on the

overall LFPR. The gender disparity, which showed the maleLFPR to be twice that of the female LFPR over the years,

continued in 2005 as well. Fufther, the LFPR of 43.0 per centin the tsunami-affected areas of the country was somewhat

lower, as could be expected, than in the rest of the country. It

was also lower than the historical levels of around 48-52 per

cent,

employment rate in the non-tsunami areas was 92.5 per cent in

August 2005.The working age population in tsunami affected

areas accounted for just below 4.0 per cent of the total working

age population in the country. Hence, even though the

employment rate in the tsunami areas remained low, at 88.2 per

cent, it had a minimal effect on the overall employment rate,

92.3 per cent in 2005, compared to 91.5 per cent in the third

quarter of 20M.s The high employment losses that were expected in hotels,fishing and small and medium industry that were severely

affected by the tsunami did not materialise in 2005. Instead,employment opportunities were generated in excess of the

Iosses, due to economic expansion and the recovery of those

affected sectors. This was in addition to the construction sectorgrowth, partly due to tsunami reconstruction work seen

throughout 2005. This was reflected in the high employment

rate estimated by the SLFS in August 2005. The increase in the

share of employment in the construction sector to 6.1 per cent

in 2005 from 4.7 per cent in the third quarter of 2004 reflected

the hi-eh -qrowth in the construction sector during 2005. Further,the share of employment of the manufacturing sector also

increased in parallel to the growth of 6.0 per cent recorded in

the manufacturing sector during the reference period. Althou-eh

the share of increase of employment in the services sector wasmarginal in 2005 compared to the third quarter of 2004,

employment in the sector increased by around 120,000 duringthe same reference period, This was contributed to byemployment increases in the Transport, storage and

communication and Finance, insurance and real estate sub

sectors that grew healthily. The trade and hotel sector, which

was severely affected by the tsunami devastation, recovered fast

enough to retain its share of employment in 2005 at a level

equal to the third quafter 2Cf,4. Meanwhile, both the share of

employment and number employed in the Personal services andother sub sectors declined, even though employment in

education within that sector increased significantly due topermanent postings of teachers under the government's

graduate employment programme in 2005.. The share of employment in the agriculture sector, which

includes the agriculture, forestry and fishing sub sectors,

declined to 30.7 per cent in August 2005 from 34.1 per cent

in the third quarter of 2004 despite healthy growth in theagriculture sector, particularly domestic agriculture. The

decline in employment could have been due to a shift of excess

labour from agriculture to other sectors with a high demand foremployment. Such a shift could have occurred especially dueto tsunami reconstruction and rehabilitation activities. This

apparent shift has not affected production levels due to use of

technology at various stages from cultivation to processing in

the agriculture sub sector in 2005. Although the fishing sub

sector is reviving somewhat faster than expected, the level of

employment was lower than in 2W4. Thus, comparatively low

employment in both sub sectors, agriculture and fishing wasreflected in the decline in the share of employment in the

agriculture sector in 2005.

Part IChapter 4 - PRICES, WAGES AND EMPLOYMENT

{& According to the SLFS, among the categories ofemployment status, the share of employment of private

sector employees showed the highest decline, from47.2per

cent in the third quarter of 2004 to 46.1 per cent in August

2005. The share of employment in the unpaid family workers

cate,eory also recorded a decline in 2005. In contrast, the share

of employment in the employers and self-employed categoriesin the private sector rose. Each category recorded greater

increases than the increase in the share of public sector

employees in 2005 compared to the third quarter of 2004. Thiswas in spite of the government's graduate employment

programme.t The government policy of expanding public sectoremployment through the graduate employmentprogramme, which began in the fourth quarter of 2004, wasmainly responsible for the increased share of public sectoremployees. Initially, the government trained about 42,000

graduates as a special project under the Ministry of Finance

before posting them to permanent positions in various public

sector institutions during the first ttree quarters of 2005. As a

result, there was only a shift of 42,000 trainee graduates under

the graduate trainee programme in the Ministry of Finance tovarious public sector institutions in 2005. Although the

govemment cancelled the Management Circular No. I 6( I ) dated

24 October 2002, that directed the downsizing of the public

sector in the country, in order to effect recruitments, particularly

under the graduate employment programmein2M,large scale

recruitment programmes did not take place in 2005, except forrecruitments to a few public sector institutions. A marginal

expansion in public sector employment was reflected in the

estimates of the Annual Public Sector Employment Survey(APSES) conducted by the Central Bank. According to theAPSES, employment in the public sector, which comprises

govemment and semi-government institutions, increased by 0.8

per cent in 2005, compared to the significant increase of 5.0 per

cent in 2004. Both govemment and semi-government sectors

contributed towards the expansion.r The government sector, which includes central government,provincial government and local government, experienced

a marginal increase of 0.9 per cent in employment in 2005.

Table 4j2

Public Sector Employment

This was due to the relatively low overall increase in

employment that took place in a few govemment institutions

such as the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Welfare, other

than the graduate postings. In contrast, the -eovemment sectoremployment increased by 7.2 per cent in 2004 due to

recruitment of 42,000 graduates as trainees under the graduateemployment programme, Recruitments to the CeylonElectricity Board and the two state banks in the semi-

government sector led to a marginal increase in employment by

O S nlJ cent in 2005 compared to 2004. There was also a

complete stoppage of VRS programmes, which were targeted

to reduce the excess staff in the semi-government sector. TheVRS that commenced in 2001, tailed off in 2004 before its

termination in the same year. As a result semi -eovernmentemployment had declined by 1.9 per cent in 2004.

Unemployments The unemployment rate estimated by the SLFS declined to

7.7 per cent in August 2005 from 8.3 per cent in 2004. This

decline was due to the overall economic growth that prevailed

during 2005, absorption of labour by the recovery from the

tsunami devastation and implementation of the graduate

employment programme. Even though the unemployment rate

in the tsunami areas was higher at 11.8 per cent in 2005, it had

a marginal impact on the overall unemployment rate because

of the low share of the labour force of 0.3 million in the tsunami

areas, compared to 7 .9 million in the non-tsunami areas.r Youth unemployment, especially among the more

educated, which has been a long-standing problem, easedto some extent, with the implementation of the graduate

employment programme in the public sector in 2005. Thisprogramme also contributed to the decline in the overall

unemployment level in the country. The unemployment rateof persons with GCE (O/L) and GCE (A/L) and higherqualifications recorded the hi.ehest declines among levels of

education in 2005, compared to the third quarler of 2004, Infact, the GCE (A/L) and hi_eher qualifled category recorded

its lowest unemployment rate of 13.8 per cent for that category

since the inception of the QLFS estimates by the DCS in 1990.

The persons with GCE (A/L) and higher qualifications mostlyfall into the age group 20-29 years, and the lower rate of

educated youth unemployment was also evident from the

decline in the unemployment rate in this age group to 17.2per

cent in 2005 from 21.4 per cent in the third quarter of 2004.

Foreign Employment

According to the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment(SLBFE), foreign employment placements grew by 8.2 percent

in 2005 to230,963 compared to2004. This exceeded the mid-

year forecast of aroun d 221,000 for 2005.This increase wasmainly boosted by employment placements in the second halfof the 2005, which recorded around 119,482 compared to

I I 1,481 in the first half of 2005. Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait

and Qatar absorbed around 80 per cent of migrant employees

and Qatar, Saudi Arabia and UAE contributed significantly to

the increase in foreign employment placements in 2005. The

demand for skilled employees was significantly hi-eh in Qatar,while housemaid and unskilled categories also showed a

somewhat higher demand in 2005. In contrast, almost the entire

demand for migrant workers from Sri Lanka to Saudi Arabia

and UAE was for housemaids.

The share of male foreign employment, which was 25 per

cent in the mid-1990s, increased from 37 per cent in 2004to 4l per cent in 2005. The overall increase in the share of

males in total foreign employment placements was mainly due

to demand for skilled and unskilled males for jobs in Qatar in

2005. As a result, the share of females declined to 59 per cent

in 2005 from 63 per cent in 2004. However the share of

housemaids, who belong to the lowest income earnin-e group,

increased to 54 per cent in 2005 flom 52 per cent in 2004.

Housemaids continued to retain the highest demand amon-e the

manpower cate-uories of migrant workers with a share of around

86 per cent of the total increase of 17,51 I foreign employment

placements in 2005.s Women have continued to accept migrant jobs as

housemaids, especially in Middle Eastern countries, due tolack of employment opportunities at home and with the

hope of accumulating significant savings. This is in spite of

increasing concerns of high risks encountered in work places

and problems in their own families. Forei_en departures forunskilled manpower categories remained relatively high,though the number and share of foreign placements in thiscategory declined in 2005 compared to 2004. The share offoreign departures of housemaids and other unskilled

manpower categories is expected to decline in the near future

because of the new govemment policy introduced under the

budget proposals of 2006 to encourage skills development for

migrant workers.

Labour Productivitya In 2005, labour productivity, estimated on the basis of

annual value addition per employee' was Rs.138'300 per

person, which is the highest for the period 2ffi1 to 2ffi5. The

increase in overall productivity was mainly due to the

significant increase in productivity in the Agriculture sector and

a marginal increase of productivity in the Services sector in

2005 compared to 2004.In contrast, productivity in the Industry

sector declined in 2005 compared to 20M. This was a reversal

of the general increasing trend since 2000. This decrease had

a dampening impact on the overall productivity. Although there

was an improvement in productivity in the Agnculture sector,

it remained around half or even lower than the productivity in

the Industry and Services sectors in 2005. Further, the low levelof productivity in agriculture has remained throughout the

period 2001 to 2005.

Labour Relationso There was a significant decrease in the number of strikesin the plantation sector in 2005 compared to 2004. Thisindicates an improvement in the relationship betweenemployers and employees. A major reason for this

improvement could be the gradual move towards collective

agreements adopted for wage bargaining. The man days lost due

to strikes in the rest of the private sector was significantly hrgh

so u rce s : 3:li:lt'l#:i;li:'# starist ics

in 2005 compared to 2004. This was mainly due to the ttree-

day strike in the Regional Transport Companies involving

around 40,000 workers in the first quarter of 2005. The

remainder of the year experienced a somewhat calm labour

environment with only 28 strikes taking place involving around

5,900 workers. The improvements seen in the employer-

employee relationships, except for this one-off strike, is an

encouraging sign. Further improvements in labour relations

could lead to productivity improvements in the entire private

sector.

Labour Market Reformsr The Ministry of Labour Relations and ForeignEmployment (MLRFE) amended the compensationformula on 15 May 2005 under the amendments to theTermination of Employment of Workmen Act (1971)

(TEWA). The National Labour Advisory Council (NLAC),

which comprises the MLRFE, trade unions and representativesfrom employers, was expected to establish a safety net

(Unemployment Benefit Insurance Scheme (tlBIS)), to provide

income support and other benefits that promote employability

of displaced workers in parallel with the compensation formula.

However, the funding of UBIS was left unresolved, as the

NLAC members could not finalise the sources of funding

during 2005.

The per employee output in theAgriculture sector remained at around Rs.77,400, half or lesscompared to the value of output in the Industry and Servicbssectors, respectively (Chart 1). The Agriculture sectoractivities are concentrated in the rural sector with anabundance of labour.

1,000 in parallel to the increase in public sector salariesunder the Budget Proposals 2005. Its objective was to protectprivate sector employees from the rising cost of livin-s.

However, due to the anticipated problems that had to be facedwith the cancellation of the Multi Fibre Aereement (MFA)

from January 2005 and the issue of renewing contracts with theclients in the middle of the year, the MLRFE deferred its

implementation in the apparel sector and security trade, for a 6

month period till Janualy 2006. Further, all plantations under

Foreign Employment extended the collective agreements inthe plantation sector to the plantations covered by the

Wages Boards of the Tea Growing and ManufacturingTrade and Rubber Growing and Manufacturing Trade aswell. Employees gained through the increase in their daily

salaries from Rs.l35 to Rs.200 under the new collective

agreements, though they were excluded tiom the provisions of

the BRAWA. In addition, the Cabinet approved the Shop and

Office Act amendments to repeal the restrictions on night workfor females attached to the IT sector in 2005. This will be

enacted as a law in Parliament soon.. Presently, the MLME, with the support of ILO, is in theprocess of amending the Factory Ordinance Aca (1942),

which covered only factories, to cover all work places. The

amended Act will be named the Occupational Safety and Health

Act. Also, under the Budget Proposals of 2006, the MLRFE isplanning to set up an Institution for Labour Studies for all

stakeholders in the labour market with a view to educating them

on their responsibilities.

towards the end of the year. The gradual removal of monetarystimulus, along with aggressive open market operations,

contained the demand driven pressure on prices due to excess

demand associated with credit expansion in the govemment and

private sector above the levels projected at the beginning of the

yeaJ.. The economy has maintained its recent growth momentum,with signs of easing pressure on both inflation andunemployment in 2005. However, against a background ofrising import prices of key investment, intermediate and

consumer goods, the impact of a tightening of monetary policy

on achieving price stability began to show results mostly in the

latter part of the year.o The pricing policy on fuel implemented during the year

yielded short-term relief to consumers, but could burden

budgetary resources and thereby affect price stability in the

medium to long - term. Keeping domestic prices of some fuel

products below international prices and removal of the VAT onspecific consumer and intermediate imports reduced price

pressure, but would have affected budgeted governmentexpenditure and revenue generation. Also, any possible

adjustments that may have taken place in the consumption

pattern in favour of more efficient utilisation of such items in

response to cost increases was also prevented by these

temporary relief measures.

{& Movements of international energy prices and forecastsabout their future developments do not indicate any

possibility of price declines in the future. Hence, high

international pnces will not be a temporary phenomenon. In this

case, lon-e-term policies are required to address their adverse

impact on the Sri Lankan economy. If domestic prices do not

reflect international prices, public awareness about the long

term net cost of this national burden is weakened and reduces

public support, that could otherwise overcome the resistance

from pockets of small interest groups, for introduction of cost-

efficient energy policies for the country.

The government policy to increase public sector wages as

well as to mandate a wage increase in the private sector,

through the new BRAWA would have achieved some relief

for wage employees against the rising cost of living.Yet, wage

increases in the public sector need to be linked to efficiency of

output to avoid upward pressure on prices that could nullify

monetary policy objectives of price stability. At the same time,

the outcome of the BRAWA, while well meant, would have

affected the profitability of private organisations, which raised

wages to be commensurate with rising inflation as routinepolicy. It may also have signaled an implied interference with

the decision-making that comes under the private sector's

purview. This would not be compatible with developing a

productivity based wage adjustment policy in the economy.

Flexibility in labour relations and consistent policies are keyelements in creating an investor friendly business

environment. Such an environment helps increase internationalcompetitiveness through continuous improvements in

productivity. Recent policy changes that led to the revision of

the compensation formula under TEWA, mandatory privatesector wage increases through the new BRAWA, and

discontinuation of VRS prograrnmes in public enterprises may

be perceived by prospective local and foreign investors asreversal of previous policies to enhance labour market

flexibility. A dialogue with the investor community to avoid any

such negative perceptions would be helpful in the long-term.

The government policy to expand the public sector throughits graduate employment programme reduced educatedyouth unemployment in 2005. The government is also

proposing to fill 10,000 public sector vacancies with new

graduates under the "Yovun Diriya" programme in 2006. The

overall increase in the public sector was expected to strengthen

the public sector through improvement in the quality of services

provided by recruiting a new work force with higher academic

qualifications. Also by implementing these programmes, the

government has attempted to minimise the educated youth

unemployment problem, particularly the long-standing issue of

graduate unemployment. The acceleration of employment in the

pubf ic sector with the training and recruitment of 42,000

graduates in 2004 and 2005 and plans to recruit another 10,000in 2006 could burden budgetary resources in the long term,

unless productivity and efficiency targets are met by the new

recruits.. Recent policy proposals are expected to raise expectationsabout foreign employment and thereby increase thenumber of departures in the future. Under these proposals,

the government will provide special training centres. Further,

migrant workers willbe encouraged to engage in longer-termforeign employment through the introduction of duty free

allowances for migrant workers who work abroad continuouslyfor one or more years. The projected expansion in foreign

employment placements would further strengthen Sri Lanka'sbalance of payments, while channeling foreign private

remittances to the less-developed regions of the country. Yet,despite higher savings, migration results in other socio-economic problems for migrant workers, their families andsociety. The continuing supply of migrant labour from SriLanka would not be necessary if the economy can expand

adequately to absorb the growing workforce in gainful

employment, particularly in manufacturing and services, that

generates foreign eamings within the country itself,

The proposed policies to enhance the skills of migrantlabour are commendable, as it would enable them to earnhigher wages in better working conditions with their higherlevel of skill. Yet, encoura-Eing a further exodus of the skilledworkforce from Sri Lanka, and more particularly from the less

developed non-urban areas, may not be compatible with theskills and workforce needed within the country to achieve thetargeted 6-8 per cent growth with more balanced regionaleconomic development proposed under the government's

economic policy framework.

In summary, while the current policies in all the above-

mentioned areas are well intentioned, they need to be constantly

reviewed and adjusted to ensure consistency and commitmentto achieving sustainable high growth in the long-term.
