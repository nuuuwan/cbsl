NATIONAL OUTPUT AND EXPENDITURE

2.1 OverviewI Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 6 per cent in realterms in 2005 compared with 5.4 per cent in 2004. The

tsunami slowed down economic growth to 4.4 per cent in the

first quarter, especially due to its negative impact on fishing andtourism. However the resilience of the economy enabled it to

grow by over 6 per cent during the remaining tluee quarters of

the year. This growth was commendable, as it was achieved

amidst rising oil prices and strong international competition for

exports. The adverse effects of the tsunami decelerated by the

fourth quarter of the year.. Among the three major economic sectors, the industry

sector achieved the highest growth rate of E.3 per cent andcontributed 36.3 per cent to the overall growth in 2ffi5. This

growth was broad-based, reflecting improved performance inall four sub-sectors, mining and quanying, manufacturing,

construction and electricity and water, The factory industry

sub-sector performed well, despite the challenges arising fromhigh oil prices and abolition of the Multi-Fibre Anangement(MFA). The continuing expansion in intemational markets andin domestic demand, as well as the resilience of the export

manufacturin,e sector, contributed to this growth.. The services sector grew by 6.4 per cent and contributed

59.3 per cent to the overall growth. The deceleration in this

sector was mainly due to the drop in hotel activities and lower

growth in import trade. Telecommunications, financial services

and domestic trade contributed most to the overall growth in

this sector,

Chart 2.1

AnnualGrowth Rates

The agriculture sector grew by 1.5 per cent and contributedpositively to economic growth by 4.4 per cent, in contrast to

20/l,4, despite the drastic slowdown in performance of the

flrshing sub-sector following the tsunami. Favourable weatherconditions supported both Maha and Yala paddy harvests to

reach record levels. Also benefiting from favourable weather,

high performance in minor export crops, subsidiary food crops

and vegetables enabled the other agriculture sub-sector tocontribute almost as much as paddy to the growth in the

agriculture sector.

GDP at current market prices was estimated at Rs.2,366billion in 2005, recording an increase of 16.6 per cent innominal terms. This rate of increase was reflected by the

acceleration in real economic growth coupled with a higher

increase in the general price level compared to the previous

year.

The overall price inflation as measured by the GDP deflator

was 9.9 per cent, higher than 93 per cent recorded in 2(X)4.

This increase is explained by higher input costs, including rising

oil prices, and demand pressure on prices driven by high creditgrowth, as well as the increase in public sector wages. In

contrast to20M, the Sri Lanka rupee remained relatively stable,

appreciating by 0.7 per cent, on average, during the year, and

did not exert pressure on domestic prices.

The GDP per capita for 2fi)5 is estimated at Rs. 120,?.82an

increase of 15.4 per cent over the previous year. In US dollar

terms, per capita GDP increased by 16.l per cent to US dollars

L,197, from US dollars 1,030 in2004.

The demand emanating from both external and domesticfronts, covering consumption and investment, contributed

to GDP growth in 2005. Export growth for goods increased,in real terms, by over 6 per cent in all four quarters of 2005,

while domestic demand for domestically produced goods and

services also grew, but at a slower pace than in the previous two

years following the euphoria of the ceasefire in20f,2. Also in

contrast to the previous two years, domestic production grew

at a faster pace than impofts, in real ferms, to meet the growth

in demand.The growth in consumption moderated in 2005.

Government consumption grew at a higher rate than private

consumption, as government expenditure rose to meet a higher

wa-ee bill and humanitarian needs following the tsunami,

(a) Revised

(b) Provisional

The investment climate, which had improved considerablyfrom the second half of 2003, continued in 2005 as well. In

the aftermath of the tsunami, a part of both private and publicsector investment was channeled into urgently needed

rehabilitation and reconstruction activities to normalise life inthe affected areas. Meanwhile. investment activities in

unaffected areas continued.4 Total investment as a ratio of GDP rose from 25 to 26.5per cent, entirely on account of government investment.

Government investment rose by I19.4 per cent, therebyalmost doubling its ratio to 4.2 per cent of GDP. This

increase more than compensated for the mar-qinal

declines in the public corporations and private investment

ratlos.B Although private investment continued, benefiting fromgrowth in both external and internal demand, the pace had

decelerated compared to the previous two years. During the

previous period, private investment had risen si,enificantly in

areas such telecommunications, transportation and factory

industries following the ceasefire, as well as in readiness forremoval of the MFA, resulting in a high base effect on

investment growth.

. The Gross National Product (GNP), defined as GDPadjusted for net factor income from abroad (NTIA), grewat a lower rate than GDP, by 5.5 per cent in real terms,marginally higher than in the previous year. The NFIA

remained negative and deteriorated by 46pr cent in 2005. Theoutflow of interest payments reduced due to the benefit of the

debt moratoria, but the inflows declined relatively more as a

result of the appreciation of the rupee and related valuation

losses, thereby mitigating most of the positive impact of higher

GDP growth on GNP.. Both domestic and national savings rose. Private domestic

savings increased on account of higher profitability in thecorporate sector, while government dis-savings fell,

Meanwhile, the increase in private transfer inflows outweighed

the deterioration in NFIA, thereby supporting the growth in

national savings.. Thetsunami which struck the country on26 Dcember 20Mhad a significant impact on the growth prospects of the

areas that were affected. This accounted for nearly two third

of the coastal belt along the North, East, South and South West

of the island and around 2 to 3 per cent of the population. While

the lives and livelihoods destroyed by the tsunami can never be

replaced, the damage caused by the tsunami has been estimatedat around 4.5 per cent of GDP. The brunt of the economic

impact for the future was felt in the fishing and tourism sectors,

while wholesale and retail trade and transport, as well as small

industries, were also affected on relatively lower scales. Fish

production is expected to recover to pre-tsunami levels by end-

2006. The recovery of tourism is far less predictable, with

perceptions and attitudes of tourists playing a vital role in the

recovery process. Although reconstruction activities took place

in 2005, with building of temporary and permanent shelters and

the restoration of transport routes and other infrastructure

facilities, much more requires to be done in the coming yearsfor the affected areas to restore them completely and to move

forward. There are many projects in pro-eress and in the pipelineto rebuild permanent housing units and to improve the

infrastructure facilities in the affected areas.

2.2 Sectoral Policies and lnstitutionalSupport. The growth in national output in 2005 was the outcome of

several favourable global and domestic factors, combinedwith the ability of the economy to face adverse global andinternal developments and challenges as well. In this

context, the sectoral policies of the govemment under its neweconomic policy package, as well as institutional support

provided by both the govemment and the private sector, created

a favourable environment within which economic activityprospered. Institutional support to the a.ericultural and

industrial sectors is described in this section, while their impact

and implications are analysed in subsequent sections.

Agricultural Policy and Institutional Supporti Successive governments during the last five decades haveendeavoured to develop agriculture. Since independence,

substantial public investment has been made to support thedevelopment of agriculture. Investments have been madeespecially for irrigation infrastructure, and setting up of anetwork of agricultural institutions to promote policydevelopment, research, extension services, marketing

infrastructure, provision of subsidies and safety nets. Yet, the

agriculture sector needs better co-ordination within this network

aiming at more focussed and effective support for adoption ofhigher technology through demand driven research and

extension services.o The new government that came to power in November 2005proposed a comprehensive policy package aiming at thedevelopment of agriculture. Agricultural growth is to be

achieved through the provision of sufficient inigated water,

land for cultivation, good quality seeds, fertiliser at a subsidisedprice, agro-technology, financial resources, agricultural

advisory services, infrastructure for purchasing and storage of

agricultural produce, fiscal incentives for investment, special

incentives for smallholders, and specific policies and incentivesfor the tea, rubber, coconut, dairy and fishery sectors. The

Budget 2006 also introduced a series of measures to promoteagriculture. These included granting subsidies to supply

fertiliser to paddy farmers at Rs. 350 per 50 kg bag, in addition

to the prevailing subsidy on Urea to all farmers at Rs. 550 per

kg bag; raising the paddy purchase price to Rs. 15.5f Rs. 17.50

per kg from the 2005106 Maha season; stipulating a condition

on banks to increase credit facilities provided to agriculture tol0 per cent of totallending; exempting profits of processing ofprimary produce from tax; removing the 15 per cent tax onincome from exporting agricultural products such as fruits,vegetables, rice, cut flowers, foliage plants and organic

a-ericultural ploduce; establishing a revolving fund of Rs. l0billion for the development of plantation crops with special

emphasis on smallholdersl increasing replanting and newplanting subsidies for tea, rubber and coconutby 25 percent;

reducing the Economic Service Charge (ESC) on tea, rubber,

and coconut processing factories from I per cent to 0.5 per cent;increasing the government purchase price of milk;implementing special credit schemes to assist dairy farmers;

and exemption of milk processing machinery from import duty

and VAT.e A national plan has been prepared by the Ministry ofPlantation Industries for the development of the plantation

sector covering the tea, rubber, coconut, and sugarcane

sectors. This long-term development plan envisa-ees increasing

competitiveness throu-eh improving productivity and quality,

and reducing costs of production. The plan includes strategiesto increase value addition; exploiting -elobal opportunities:factory modernisation; and replantin-{ and new plantin-e

programme s mi ni mi si n-e environmental damage.

The Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB) took several measures to

increase the production, yields and quality of tea. SLTB

made it compulsory to obtain prior approval for construction ofnew tea factories and has issued directions on minimum

standards that should be maintained. In addition, the SLTB has

introduced green leaf quality standards, the 'Ceylon Tea QualityCertificate' scheme and minimum quality criteria for export of

tea to promote export of high quality tea. Tea factories are

required to obtain Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point

(HACCP) certification to ensure maintenance of good hygienic

and processing standards at every level in the manufacturing

process to be able to export tea to the EU countries with effectfrom June 2006. At present, only about 25 factories have

obtained this certification. For this purpose, the Ministry ofPlantation Industries allocated Rs. 250 million under thePlantation Development Project (PDP) for factory

modernisation and rehabilitation. The SLTB has also taken

steps to closely monitor imports of tea.

The government launehed several programmes to improverubber cultivation to reap the benefit of rising demand fornatural rubber. Rain guards were supplied at a subsidised rate

to increase tapping intensity and fertiliser application was

promoted in mature plantations under financial assistance from

the 'Thurusaviya Fund'. Initial measures were taken to establish

a substation of the Rubber Research Institute in Polgahawela to

develop rubber cultivation in the North Westem Province. The

government also initiated a project to expand rubber plantation

in Moneragala and Badulla districts.

Several measures have been taken to develop the coconut

sector. These include creating a second coconut triangle in the

Southern province covering Middeniya, Tangalle and Matara,

increasing the export cess for desiccated coconut (DC) to Rs.

2,000 per metric ton from Rs. 1,000 per metric ton with effect

from I April2005 and establishing the 'Kapruka Fund' for the

revitalisation of the coconut industry. Legislation was also

introduced to prevent excessive fragmentation of coconut land.

The export agriculture sector received continuous supportfrom relevant institutions. The Department of Export

Agriculture (DEA) under its cluster villages system assisted the

sector throu-eh distribution of inputs, providing post-harvest

handling facilities and equipment, technical advice, establishin-e

marketin,e links and providing financing facilities. Considerin-q

the lack of skilled peelers, the DEA established a cinnamon

processing training centre in Kosgoda in 2005 to provide

training on peeling methods. The Department of Agriculture

promoted organic cultivation of crops and their export among

farmers by providing technology, training and financial

assistance for the production of organic fertiliser.

The government introduced several incentives to enhance

sale of paddy and took several measures to stabilise paddy

prices. The repayment period of loans obtained by rice millers

from banks during 20M105 Maha season has been extended up

to March 20f,6. The record output in paddy and the consequentfall in prices led the government to implement a paddy

purchasing scheme in 2005. The government ananged for the

purchase of paddy at the specified floor prices for different

varieties through co-operatives, Agrarian Services Centres and

farmer organisations. These floor prices ranged from Rs. 15.50

per kg (Nadu) to Rs. 16.50 per kg (for Samba and Red Rice).

This scheme cost Rs, 1,325 million and Rs. 1,251 million,

respectively, for the Maha and Yala seasons. Accordingly,

around 83,000 metric tons of paddy (4 per cent of Maha

harvest) were purchased during the Maha season and around

52,000 metric tons (4 per cent of Yala harvest) were purchased

during the Yala season under this scheme. The limit of paddy

purchasing loans under the New Comprehensive Rural Credit

Scheme (NCRCS) was raised from Rs. 25 million to Rs. 50

million per purchaser during the Maha season and was further

increased to Rs. 75 million per purchaser during Yala season

to purchase paddy at floor prices.

Some progress was made in rice and sugarcane research. the

Rice Research Institute (RRI) developed several new hybrid

short-duration rice varieties and drought resistant and flood

proof varieties with 20per cent more potentialyield levels have

been introduced. RRI has further introduced an improvedmethod (parachute method) for sowing paddy, which

significantly reduces the requirement of seed paddy and cost of

labour. The Sugarcane Research Institute (SRI) continued its

research activities and extension services to expand the local

sugar industry. Feasibility studies were conducted for

cultivating su-qarcane as an inter-crop in coconut lands. SRI

developed a new hi-eh yielding variety of sugarcane (SL94-

3325) which could enhance yields by 54 per cent.s The dairy industry has been targeted for a revival with a

series of policies introduced in recent years. The government

introduced the Dairy Farmer Empowerment Project to provide

training for farmers and has taken steps to improve marketing

and healthcare of animals. In addition, action was taken to set

up 50 dairy villa-ees with at least 20 dairy farmers in each

villa-ee. To encoura-ee dairy farmin-E, the government raised the

purchasing price of milk from Rs. l8 per litre to Rs. 20 per litre

dunng the year. Steps were also taken to expand the supply of

breedin.e animals, improve veterinary services and support the

Veterinary Research Institute for further development of thedairy industry towards realising the government's five-year

development plan of doubling domestic milk production.e The government introduced several measures to revive thetsunami affected fishery sector. The government distributedboats with the assistance of donors and provided a diesel

subsidy to affected fishermen. The Bud-seI2006proposed to set

up a Fishing Promotion Fund by allocatin_e Rs. 700 million todevelop the multi-day boat manufacturing industry and to

provide easy payment schemes for fishermen to purchase suchboats to promote offshore and deep-sea fishin-e. The

-qovernment also allocated Rs. 50 million to promote

ornamental fish exports through such projects. Meanwhile,

steps were taken to revive prawn farming and Rs.l00 million

has been allocated to improve shrimp farmin_e in Puttalam and

Batticaloa districts.t The Forest Department conducted forestry developmentprojects continuously with the assistance of foreign donors,particularly the Asian Development Bank (ADB). In line

with the Forestry Sector Master Plan, in 2005 the ADB funded

Forest Resources Management Project was implemented and isin progress. With the participation of the community, someactivities such as re-{eneration of cutting areas, roadside

plantin-e and coastal plantations were canied out to promote re-

forestation, The Deparrment conducted awareness programmes,

includin-e educational seminars, workshops, lectures, video filmshows for school children and others with re-eard tobiodiversity, forestry, environmental science and Sinharaja

conservatton.

lndustrial Policy and Institutional Supports The thrust of the industrial policy of the government asreiterated in the Budget 2006 is to foster and facilitate aglobally competitive and environment friendly industrial

sector through enhanced investment and innovation u'ith

the participation of a socially responsible private sector and

a strong, facilitative public sector, The industrial policyfurther emphasises expansion of _elobal market access,

promotion of advanced technology, regional industrialisation,

promotin-e small and medium enterprises (SMEs), developing

backward linkages and encoura.sement of domestic resources

based export industries. The -eovernment facilitation is aimedat enhancin-u market access, strengthening the le_eal andre-uulatory framework, improvin_q corporate governance,

facilitating easy access to foreign technology and fbreign direct

investment, providin_q a stable macroeconomic framework and

enablin_q firms to better harness the benefits of investment tn

knorvled-Qe and human capital.

Increased attention was paid to enhance access to foreignmarkets. The -eovernment had discussions on enhancing

market access in the United States, the European Union throu_eh

the GSP+ scheme, Pakistan through a Free Trade Agreement(FTA), India through extendin-u the existing FTA to a

Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA),

South and East Asian countries throueh BIMST-EC andSAARC countries throu_eh SAFIA.

The government has provided fiscal incentives for adoptingadvanced technology and taken measures to promoteregional industrialisation with targeted incentives. Fiscal

incentives of permitting duty free imports of technologically

advanced machinery are still in place. The industries identifiedfor provision of incentives for adoptin-q advanced technologyinclude printin-e, health care, gem cutting and polishing.

packagin-e and rice milling. Under this scheme, imported plantand machinery will be exempted from duty, subject to

supervision by the relevant ministries, and the depreciation

allowance will be increased to 33 l/3 per cent for estimation of

taxable income. The plan of regional industrialisation is to set

up 300 factories outside Colombo and Gampaha districts in thefirst phase, with at least one factory being set up in eachDivisional Secretariat area outside these districts. To receiveincentives, these factories should be established with a

minimum capital of Rs. 30 million invested within 2 years fromApril 2006 and should employ a minimum of 200 workers.

Incentives include exemption from income tax for 5-10 years

and exemption fi'om any duties and VAT on imports of newplant and machinery. Factories could claim the cost of

relocation out of Colombo and Gampaha as a deduction from

taxable income . Lendin-9 institutions have been incentivised to

provide financing to those factories by exempting such interest

income from tax.

A comprehensive package to develop SMEs has been

proposed in the Budget 2006to further strengthen existingefforts. This comprises rationalising and simplifying the tariffstructure aimed at eliminatin-e tariff on raw materials and

machinery imporrs, establishment of an Innovation Facilitation

20Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2005

Part IChapter 2 - NATIONAL OUTPUT AND EXPENDITURE

Network (IFN), setting up of an Institution for International

Relations and Strategic Studies (IRSS), and establishment of

an Academy of Labour Relations (ALR) for SMEs, The SME

Bank was set up in 2005 with an initialcapital of Rs.5 billion

to provide financin-e at concessionary interest rates through

moftgage free lendin-e instruments. Existing programmes forSMEs such as streamlining of bureaucratic procedures,

simplified VAT applications, customs regulations and export

procedures and providing institutional support for improvin-{technical capabilities, quality mana-qement, productivityimprovement, internet access, and obtaining qualitycertification towards development of SMEs were further

stren-ethened in 2005,

The Budget2006 placed emphasis on further developmentof the domestic textile industry. The budget proposed the

continuation of the ongoing debt restructuring programme in

textile factories on risk sharin,e basis between the government

and banks, and procurement of the entire requirement of

uniform material for school children and the armed forces from

local manufacturers with the aim of providing a secured market

for them. In addition to the existing Horana Textile Processing

Zone,Thulhiriya will be developed as a dedicated textile zone

supported with incentives similar to those accorded to BOI

approved industries.

The government has initiated several other measures to

enhance competitiveness of the apparel industry as theindustry is now exposed to intense global competition with

the end of the quota system. As spelled out in the NationalCouncil for Economic Development (NCED) policy

document, the vision of the government is to transform the

apparel industry from a contract manufacturer to a full service

value added solution provider and to meet growth targets set

out in the Five Year Strategy Plan for the apparel industry. The

Budget 2006 proposed to set up a Textile and Clothin-e College(TACC) at Thulhiriya Iinked with similar internationalinstitutions for training in management, designing andfinishing. The University of Moratuwa also introduced a

desi-qn and product development degree programme in 2005.

The Ministry of Industrial Development (MID) and JointApparel Association Forum (JAAF) launched severalproductivity improvement, image building and skills

development programmes at factory level, The government

also assisted manufacturers to improve their factories to

comply with international standards in respect of labour, the

environment and corporate -qovernance, which will help them

expand international market access.

Sri Lanka's location close to main sea and air routesprovides a special opportunity for the country to be

developed as an attractive apparel hub in the region. For

this purpose, fbreign investment tbr mega shoppin-e malls is

encouraged throu.eh providin-e BOI incentives subject to the

requirement of maintaining a minimum export quantum and

being liable to VAT. Katunayake has been identified as the

appropriate location for the proposed apparel hub due to its

proximity to the free trade zone and international airport.a The special programme initiated in 2004 for enhancing

competitiveness of targeted thrust industries of textile and

apparel, footwear, leather products, ceramics, rubber, and

wood and wood based industries continued in 2005. Under

this pro-eramme, major activities undertaken by the MID in2005 included factory expansion and modernisation

pro-qrammes, capacity building programmes, business

development services and provision of technical advice to

modemise the existing factories.s The Budget 2006 proposed special measures and duty

concessions for further development of the printing andpackaging industry. The prevailing 15 per cent duty on all

categories of imported paper will be removed, while the duty

on imported cans will be reduced to 6 per cent, aimin-e at

reducing the high cost of local printing and packaging. The

import duties on raw materials will be placed at a lower tariff

band to rectify anomalies in the existing tariff structure. A

Packaging Development Centre equipped with a testing

laboratory will be established by the government to enhance

quality in the printing and packaging industry in Sri Lanka.& The government continued to resolve operational problems

of industrialists and investors in 2005 through the InvestorFacilitation Forum (IFF) that was established in 2004. The

IFF was established to facilitate large-scale investment projects

and eliuunate bottlenecks faced by industnalists in the areas of

land acquisition, environmental clearance, and local and centralgovernment approvals. In addition to the IFF, the Export

Development Board (EDB) also continued to resolve problems

of exporters at the Exporters' Forum.& In 2005, the UNIDO cleaner production (CP) programme

in collaboration with the government continued to expandits activities toward building national CP capacities,fostering dialogue between industry and government andenhancing investment for transfer and development ofenvironmentally sound technologies. Through this

pro-qramme, the government is expecting to bridge the gap

between competitive industrial production and environmental

concerns.

revised downwards following the latest census.r The estimatednational average yield was 1,645 kg per ha in 2005, which

remains below potentially achievable yields. The average costof teaproduction increasedbyT.3 percentto Rs. 168.85 perkg

1 According to the Census of Tea Small Holdings conducted by the Department olCensus and Statistics in 2005, land area has been revised upwards. Taking thisinto account, average yield in lhe smallholder sector has been revised downwardsby the Tea Smallholders Development Authority |ISHDA). The average yield levelin the plantalion seclor is based on lhe bearing extents provided by the plantationcompanres.

in both Maha and Yala seasons and a record production of tea

were major contributors to this growth. Improved performancein other field crops and vegetables, rubber and other exportagricultural crops also contributed to the recovery. Coconutoutput did not recover fully due to the lagged effect of thedrought in the early part of 2004. Fish production, that was

adversely affected by the tsunami in December2004, also hadnot recovered fully by end 2005.G The share of the Agriculture sector in GDP declinedfurther from 17.9 per cent in 2004 to 17.2 per cent in 2005.The shrinking of the Agriculture sector's share with therelatively higher growth of the Services and Industry sectors

was further exacerbated by the contraction in the fishing sub-

sector after the tsunami.

Export Agriculture

Total tea production reached a new record of 317 millionkg, registering a growth of 2.5 per cent in 2005. Tea fetchedhigh international prices throughout2005. The increase inproduction was achieved through production increases of 8 percent and I I per cent in high and medium elevations,respectively. Tea responded well to favourable weatherconditions that prevailed in those elevations, as well as the

efforts made to achieve higher production induced by higher teaprices. However, production in low grown areas declinedmarginally by I per cent, since those areas did not receivesufficient rainfall, especially in the first quarter of 2005. Thelow incidence of labour disputes and strikes in Regional

Plantation Companies (RPCs) may also have conttibuted to thrsincrease. Total tea production consisted of 315 million k_e of

black tea and of 2 million k-e of green tea. Black tea consisted

of 299 million kg of orthodox tea and l6 million kg of cut, tear

and curl (CTC) tea in 2005.

As in previous years, the smallholder tea sector continuedto dominate and contributed 65 per cent of total teaproduction in 2005 due to both greater land area used aswell as higher yields. The average yield in the smallholder

in 2005 due to increases in input prices such as fertiliser,

agrochemicals and fuel, as well as wage increases.

Rubber production increased for the fourth consecutive

year. In 2005, production increased by as much as 10.2 per centto 104 million k-e. The rise in international oil prices led to a

sharp increase in synthetic rubber prices which, in turn, raised

prices of natural rubber. Domestic production of rubber rose

throu-eh increased tapping and hi-eher yields due to increased

f'ertiliser usage, increased technology application such as rain

guards, and better cultivation practices. The average yield of

rubber increased from 1,064 k-e per ha to 1,170 kg per ha in

2005. The average cost of production of rubber rose by 4 per

cent mainly due to increases in wages. Attractive prices and

subsidies have encoura-eed replanting of rubber which -erew by

77 per cent to 1,448 ha in 2005. With the expansion of rubber-

based industries, domestic demand for natural rubber aiso

increased considerably by 34 per cent to 73 million kg in 2005.

Coconut output declined in 2005 due to the lagged effect ofdrought occurred in 2003 and early 2004 combined with a

mite infestation. The lowest monthly production was reported

in February 2005. As the weather became more favourable, and

the mite infestation was gradually brou-eht under control,

production be-ean to improve from April 2005. However, total

production in 2005 declined by 2.9 per cent to 2,515 millionnuts. The cost of production of coconut increasedby 27 per

cent to Rs. 9.50 per nut in 2005.

The output of other export crops such as cinnamon, cloves,pepper, nutmeg, coffee, cocoa and arecanuts increased in2005. Production increased si-enificantly for cloves (36 per

cent), pepper (21 per cent) and nutmeg (23 per cent) in 2005,

benefitin-e from research and extension services and favourable

climatic conditions. hoduction of export agriculture crops grew

by 28 per cent in volume terms and24 per cent in value terms

in 2005, recordin-e the highest -erowth during the past three

decades.

Domestic Agricultures Paddy output increased to a nen'record level in 2005. The

paddy output in 2004105 Maha season increased by 20,5 per

cent to 2,012,706 metric tons, while the output in Yala 2005

season also increas edby 28.7 per cent to I,233,480 metric tons,raising annual output by 23.5 per cent to a record 3,246,186

meh'ic tons in 2005. The well-distributed rainfall tlroughout

the year led to an increase in cultivated extent in major paddy

-erowin,e areas and on mar-einal lands. The motivation forcultivation was the attractive paddy prices that prevailed in2004. The output received a further boost from improved

cultivation practices in 2005. The lower yield in mar-9inal landscontributed to an overall decline in the avera.sie yield from a

record yield of 4.09 metric tons per hain2004 to 3.97 metric

tons per ha in 2005.& Output of other food crops also increased, benefiting fromfavourable weather conditions. Production of subsidiary

food crops, such as kurakkan, maize, -qreen gram, red onions

and chillies and both up-country and low-country vegetables

increased in 2005. Potato production declined marginally by

1.3 per cent. Prices of some vegetables, however, were higher

due to high costs of inputs and transportation. Production ofmajor fruit varieties such as mango, pineapple, and papaw

also rose in 2005, while production of banana reported a

decline.s Domestic production of sugar declined in 2005. Domestic

su-qar production declined by 7 per cent in 2005 to 54,000metric tons due to problems in the two factories, namely, a

mechanical breakdown at Pelwatte su-qar factory and labour

disputes at Sevanagala factory. As sugar imports amounted to

418,000 metric tons in 2005, the share of domestic production

in the total supply of sugar was around I I per cent. International

sugar prices increased steadily in 2005, due to the significant

demand arisin-e from the alternate use of sugarcane in the

production of bio-fuels, thereby making the domestic cost of

production competitive.

Livestocko Total milk production increased by 1.3 per cent to 193million litres in 2005. This consisted of 161.8 million litres ofcow milk and 30.9 million litres of buffalo milk. Thegovernment has initiated several programmes to increasedomestic milk production and popularise fresh milk

consumption. However, current domestic milk production is

around 15 per cent of the total milk requirement of the country

and the balance is imported mainly in powdered form.G The poultry sector performed well during 2005. Domesticchick production increased due to higher private sectorinvestment in poultry breeding. Demand for poultry meat

increased in 2005 in the wake of the shortfall in fish production

after the tsunami. As a result, poultry meat production increasedby 2.7 per cent to 97 ,256 metric tons in 2005. However, egg

production declined by I per cent to 865 million eggs in 2005

compared to 2004. Sri Lanka imposed a temporary ban on

import of live birds and poultry products from October 2005 toprotect the domestic poultry industry from the bird flu. In

December, this ban was relaxed to meet the domestic demandduring the festival season and imports were allowed from

countries free from the bird flu. It is important to encourage

investment in local breeding farms for a steady supply of chicks

at a lower cost and to minimise the exposure to poultry diseasesfrom other countries.

Fishingo Fish production dropped sharply by 43 per cent in 2005 due

to the impact of the tsunami. Fish production fellby 77.6per

cent during the first quarter of 2005 when compared to pre-

tsunami levels, but by the fourth quarter of 2005 the decline infish production was contained at 18.7 per cent. This decline,

however, was in addition to the 13.5 per cent contraction in thefourth quafter of 2004, which reflected the immediate impact

of the tsunami of 26December.

Table 2.5

Fish ProductionMetricTons'000

Sub-Sector2004(al20051b)

s Marine fish production declined by 48.5 per cent due totsunami related loss of fishermen, fishing crafts and flrshing

gear, while inland and aquaculture flrsh production declinedby I per cent as a result of the white spot disease in prawn

farms. The potential capacity of deep-sea fishing could not be

achieved in 2005 due to inadequate multi-day boats and fishing

vessels, combined with the slow growth of reconstruction of

suppoftive infrastructure, such as fishery harbours, markets, andice-making plants after the tsunami. It is expected that fishproduction would recover to the level recorded in 2004 by

2006.

Forestryr The government agencies as well as the private sector

developed forestry to provide timber to industry. In 2005,

the corporate sector, which comprises 23 RPCs, and the JanathaEstates Development Board/Sri Lanka State PlantationCorporation have diversified a total extent of 627 hectaresunutilised land into forestry. Meanwhile, the State TimberCorporation continued to provide timber to the public and

private sector. The totaloutput of finished goods of logs, sawn

timber and firewood of the Corporation, increased significantlyby @ per cent to285,634 cubic meters over the year.

Industryo The Industrial sector, consisting of the four sectors ofmining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction andelectricity and water, grew by 8.3 per cent in2005 compared

to 5.2 per cent in2004. The share of the industry sector in GDP

increased from26.4 percent in 2004 to27 per cent in 2005 and

contributed to 36 per cent of the overall growth in 2005. Themanufacturing sector, the largest of the four sub-sectors,

accounted for l6 per cent of GDP and contributed l6 per cent

to overall growth in 2005.I In the manufacturing sector, the output of factoryindustries, which accounted for over 80 per cent ofmanufacturing output, grew hy 6.2 per cent in 2005. This

was achieved despite several challenges such as volatile oil

prices, the abolition of the MFA and devastation caused by the

tsunami. The momentum in the industrial sector gathered pace

in 2005 with the robust growth in global trade in the early part

of the year as well as growing domestic demand. The buoyancyin manufacturing activity has been well supported by export

demand across a wide spectrum of industries, favourable

weather, expansion of bank credit, rising capacity utilisation,

sustained corporate performance and growin-e business and

consumer confidence. The entire growth in factory industry has

come from private sector industries, as output in public sector

industries declined by 6.2 per cent in 2005.s The Industrial sector has been benefiting from thegovernment's continuous efforts in expanding market

access with the rest of the world through bilateral andmultilateral trade negotiations. The process was aided by Sri

Lanka's high labour and environment protection standards, a

conducive investment promotin-e policy atmosphere and hi-eh

literacy of the labour force. Intensified competition in the -elobalmarket has encouLaged a process of consolidation and

restructurin-e of Sri Lankan industries in line with global supply

and demand conditions.

The growth in factory industry was broad-based across allindustrial categories. However, the main drivers of growth

were the industrial categories of textile, wearing apparel and

leather products; food, beverages and tobacco products;

chemical, rubber and plastic products; and non-metallic mineral

products. These four industrial categories accounted for over 90

per cent of growth in the industrial sector.

The growth in rubber gloves, tyres, apparel, textiles,ceramic, plastic, leather and processed diamonds was

mainly export-driven. These industries benefited from the

upturn in global demand, particularly in US and EU markets.

Despite the relatively higher domestic inflation and sudden

appreciation of exchange rates following the tsunami, expott

competitiveness was maintained with aggressive cost cutting.

The competitiveness was further sharpened through product

specialisati on, streamli ni n g producti on processe s and c ateri n -eto niche markets. These initiatives were supported by the

intense application of information technology at various stages

in the production and marketing process.

The growth of domestic market oriented industries was led

by the high performance in the processed food, beverages'liquor, beer, milk products, cement, building materials,ceramic products, animal feed, soap and detergent andfabricated metal products categories. The relatively low

interest rate regime that prevailed in 2005 and the increase in

per capita income of consumers encouraged consumer spending

and expanded demand for these products. Post-tsunami

reconstruction activities, as well as the growth momentum in

the construction industry, raised demand for building materials.

The output of the textile, apparel and leather products

category registered a 4.9 per cent growth in 2005 andcontributed 3l per cent to the overall growth of factory

industries. The moderate growth of this sub-sector in 2005 was

mainly due to a drop in prices of apparel products particularly

durin-e the second half of 2005. However, Sri Lanka was able

to maintain its world market share due to the stren-eth of some

core cate-qories of high quality apparel products mainly in the

US market under a quota free market environment. Although,

the European Union (EU) has given zero duty market access for

apparel exports from Sri Lanka under the GSP+ scheme, the

benefits gained were minimal due to the rigid rule of origin

(ROO) criteria, which require products to contain more than 48

per cent domestic value addition to be eligible for receiving the

duty concessions. The gradual restructuring process, which has

been implemented durin-e the last five year period, and

improved backward and forward linkages greatly supported the

,qrowth of the sector in 2005.

The output in the food, beverages and tobacco category

grew by 4.8 per cent in 2005 and contributed 17 per cent tofactory industry growth in 2005. Hi-eher production was

witnessed in all sub-sectors of food processin-{ (5.1 per cent),

bevera-ees (3.3 per cent), liquor (7.5 per cent) and tobacco (3.0

per cent). Growth in the food sub-sector in 2005 is attributed

to the improved performance in a wide range of products such

as milk products, soy products, ice cream and fruit and

vegetable processing and canning. The rising consumer

expenditure due to relatively lower interest tates, increased

salaries and increased harvest in agricultural areas has

The Multi-Fibre Arranqement (MFA). which ,qovernedintemational trade in textile and apparel throu.eh a system ofquota, was abolished from the beginning of 2005. Theexperience up to end 2005 indicated that the impact of theaboiition varied from countr-y to country. Some largeexporting countries such as China and India have gained,while some smaller countries have lost. Yet, a few smallcountries including Sri Lanka have been able to retain theirmarket share, (Table 85.l).In the quota free market environment, Sri Lankanapparel exports are mainly destined for two markets, theUnited States (58 per cenr) and the European Union (37 percent). The quota restriction in the EU market was removedin 2003 preferentially for Sri Lanka and until end of 2004,around 90 per cent of the -earment exports to the US marketfaced quota restrictions. In the quota free marketenvironment, apparel exports from Sri Lanka to the USmarket have increased both in terms of value and volumeduring the first nine months of 2005. This was achievedthrou,eh Sri Lanka's key competitive advanta-ee in the USmarket in some core categories of apparel products.However, apparel exports from Sri Lanka to EU havedeclined both in terms of value and volume during the firstnine months of 2005. Concessions received under the GSP+scheme from the EI.l did not materialise due to difficulties in

stimulated domestic demand for these products- The output of

liquor increased by 7 .5 per cent with growing domestic demand,

despite an upward revision of excise duties. The output of

mineral water also achieved a high -qrowth.The output of chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic

products, the third largest category of factory industries,

grew by 12.5 per cent in 2005 reflecting the healthy growthin rubber-based products, chemical and fertiliser. The

sectoral contribution to factory industry -qrowth was 39 per cent.

The output of rubber-based products grew by 25 per cent ln

2005, driven by external demand for rubber gloves and tyres,

which absorbed 90 per cent of domestic production. The US

remained the major export destination of Sri Lanka's rubber

based products, followed by UK and Germany' New markets

were found in Vietnam, the Russian Federation, Romania and

the Asia-Pacific region. The domestic demand for plastic and

PVC products grew substantially with the growing conshuction

industry.

The non-metallic products category registered a 6.2 per centgrowth in 2005 and contributed 8 per cent to the overallgrowth in factory industry. Buildin-e materials such as

cement, ceramics, and roofin-{ sheets, faced a hi-eher demand

fi'om state infrastructure developments projects, expansion of

commercial construction and post-tsunami reconstruction

activities. There has also been a pro-uressive implovement in

output of tableware and other ceramic products with the

growin-e demand for these products from USA and EU. Major

manufacturers expanded production capacity, while reducin-e

the cost of production throu-eh the introduction of the latest

technologies tbr energy saving. However. the over exploitation

of essential raw material stocks such as China Clay could be a

major problem for the ceramic industry in the long-run.

The output of fabricated metal products grew by 3.0 per

cent in 2005 compared to 4.3 per cent growth in 2004' The

moderation of growth in this category was mainly due to the

decline in certain exports such as electronic items and computer

parts due to higher competition in global markets' However,

domestic market oriented products such as agricultural

equipment, manufacturing and repairing of boats, assemblingof motorcycles, water pumps, steel furniture and electrical

equipment registered a relatively hi-eher performance in 2005.

The demand for boats and other related equipment increased

substantially in 2005 due to replacement of boats damaged by

the tsunami. The motorcycle assemblin-e industry also

re-eistered a higher growth due to rising income Ievels,availability of attractive financing packages, and the

introduction of many affordable models. The demand for

cables, bulbs and light finings benefited from the expansion of

the construction industry. The expansion of rural electrification

helped boost the demand for electrical appliances.

The output of public sector industries declined by 6.2 per

cent in real terms in 2005 compared to a 5.1per cent growth

in 2004. The closure of the oil refinery of the Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation (CPC) for routine maintenance work for one month

in 2005 was the main reason for the reduction of the output in

public sector industries. The output of the CPC, whrch accoun[sfor over 90 per cent of the public sector industrial output,

declined by 6.9 per cent in 2005. The output of Lanka Salt Ltd

declined by 17.8 on account of damage caused by the tsunami

to the saltems. Labour unrest resulted in a decline in output by

18.9 per cent in Sevanagala Sugar Industries Ltd. in 2005- The

output of Lanka Phosphate Ltd. grew by 2.9 per cent owing to

the hi-eher demand for fertiliser from the domestic a-qriculture

and plantation sectors.

Part IChapter 2 - NATIONAL OUTPUT AND EXPENDTTURE

The average ex-factory profit ratio in the non-BOI sectorincreased by 2.1 per cent to 14.4 per cent in 2005. Theprofit ratio in the industrial sector was estimated on the basisof the excess ex-factory value of production over the total

cost of production of 490 non-BOI firms surveyed in 2005.The improvement of profitability in 2005 is attributed ro rheexpansion in domestic sales, and the eft'ective pricin-q policiesof manufacturers. The lower interest cost, waste reduction,

better management of working capital and optimal use of rawmaterials helped contain costs of production. The stability ofthe rupee against the US dollar resulted in containingthe growth in imported raw material costs, though thesudden appreciation of the rupee immediately following thetsunami adversely affected the profitability of the exportoriented and import substitution industries. The relative shareof imported intermediate inputs was high in garments,milk products, wheat flour products, apparel, and paper andpaper products.

The wage bill in factory industries increased by 16 per centin 2005 due to increases in the number of employees and inwage rates. Many companies outsourced hi-eh cost units andintroduced performance based salary increases to contain the

excessive increase in the overall wage bill. The containment of

the overtime bill through efficient deployment of workers alsohelped contain the total wage bill. The share of energy cost intotal production cost increased from 5.9 per cent in2004 to 6.0

percent 2005 with the upward revision of petroleum prices. Theenergy costs are a significant proportion of the cost ofproduction in the cement and ceramic industries. The interestcost, as a percenta-ge of total cost of production, which isrelatively low, remained at the same level of 2.2 per cent as in

the previous year.

Labour productivity, estimated on the basis of the changein the real value added per man-hour increased by 2.9 percent in 2005 compared with a 2.6 per cent increase in theprevious year. Rapid expansion of infbrmation technologyand the installation of automated systems, especially inceramics, cement, bakeries and rubber gloves industries,helped improve labour productivity. The improvement of

labour productivity in 2005 is also attnbuted to intense effbrtsby manufacturers to rationalise operations, more effective

deployment of manpower, introduction of better management

practices and skills development.

Processing of plantation crops grew by 2.7 per cent invalue added terms compared to a grorvth of 1.3 per centin 2004. This was mainly due to hi-eher rea and rubberproduction. Coconut production declined, which had anegative impact on the production of desiccated coconut andcoconut oil,

The small industry sub-sector recorded a growth of 9.8 percent compared to the negligible growth in the previousyear. The impetus to growth in small industry came fromfavourable agriculture sector performance. The record paddyharvest as well as the growth in subsidiary food cropsincreased paddy milling and other milling and grinding

activities. The small scale production of coir, coconut shell

and copra related items declined due to the fall in coconutoutput in the first half of the year. With continued expansionin the construction sector, value addition in timber milling,rock metal production and tiles, bricks, cement blocks and

related production also increased si_qnificantly, In response to

risin-e per capita incomes, small-scale production of take-awayfoods, clothing and footwear and jewellery also rose, but

moderately.

were revised upwalds for both domestic and non-domestic

consumers with effect from March 2005.& The mining and quarrying sector grew by 14.1 per cent in

value added terms compared to a growth of 7.9 per centduring the previous year. The mining sub-sector grew by a

considerable 28 per cent due to the favourable performance of

both gem mining and other mining activities during 2005. Gem

exports increased by 20.2 per cent in volume terms while other

minin-q activities increased by about 77.9 per cent in volume

terms due to increased production of mineral sands and

phosphate. While the production of graphite declined, value

addition increased by producin-e higher quality graphite for the

export market. The quarrying sub-sector also recorded a growth

of 8.9 per cent with increased activity levels in the construction

sector.

Services& The Services sector maintained its relative importance inthe economy and contributed most to overall economicgrowth. Many sub-sectors in the services sector have expanded

steadily and healthily during the past few years to provide an

enabling environment for -{reater efficiency and productivity in

the other two sectors, a-ericulture and industry, through

improvements in communication, financial services and otherbusiness services. However, capacity limitations and

infrastructure inadequacies have limited expansion of the

transport sector to somewhat moderate rates that are well belowits growth potential. These limitations in transport have

impacted on the growth potential in the domestic trade sector

as well. Meanwhile, the hotels and restaurants sub-sector

within the services sector contracted as a consequence of the

tsunamr.# As in previous years, the services sector provided the major

impetus to economic growth. In 2005 the services sector's

contribution to the GDP was 56 per cent and it contributed 59

percent of the GDP -erowth. The sector reported 6.4 per cent

growth in 2005 compared to the 7 .6 per cent -erowth in 2004.This deceleration was mainly due to the lower -growth in

The construction sector grew by 8.9 per cent during 2005over a growth of 6.6 per cent during the previous year.

Various reconstruction projects were implemented durin-e 2005

to rebuild housing and infrastructure dama-eed by the tsunami.

These included building of temporary shelters as well as

permanent shelters and other infrastructure projects such as

railways and roads. Also, on-going foreign funded projects

continued dunng 2005, particularly in road development, water

supply and sanitation and ini-eation. The growth in this sector

was evident from the growth in import volumes and domesticproduction of buildin-e materials, including cement. Cement

sales increased significantly durin-e the first half of 2005 and

increased at an even higher rate in the second half of the year.

During the year, price levels of most construction materialsincreased si-enificantly. According to the Institute for

Construction Training and Development (ICTAD), the overallprice level in construction had increased by 14 per cent

compared to 2004.

The electricity and water sector expanded by 23.3 per centin 2005 compared to a contraction of 2.5 per cent in 2004.

Electricity generation increased in 2005 with growin-e demand

in the household, commercial and industdal sectors. Electricity

generation expanded due to the -erowth in both hydro electric

power and thermal power generation by 16.7 per cent and 4.6

per cent, respectively. About 6l per cent of the total power

-eeneration was met by thermal power. The decline in thermal

power contribution from 63 per cent in 2004 was due to the

higher -qeneration of hydro electric power particularly durin-e

the last quarter of 2005. Value addition in the electricity sub-

sector increased by 26.3 per cent due to hi-eher hydro electric

power -ueneration and the shift in thermal power ,eenerationfrom thermal power hired by the CEB, at relatively hi,eher costs,

Part IChapter 2 - NATIONAL OUTPUT AND EXPENDITURE

The tsunami of 26 December 2004 caused loss of 35.322human lives, injuring 21,441persons, displacing about

500,000 persohs and leaving 1,500 children without parents,'It caused extensive damage to physical property andinfrastructure and loss of Iivelihoods. The immediate relief

and rescue operations were carried out successfully with the

help of local communities, the government, the private sector,bilateral and multilateral donors and local and intemationalnon-governmental organisations (NGOs). The government

spent Rs.12 billion in 2005 to provide relief to tsunami-affected families. The recovery and reconstruction process isexpected to take 3-5 years and cost about US dollars 2.2billion. The intemational donor community has pledged USdollars 2.8 billion for recovery and reconstruction activities,while debt relief (principle and interest payments) amountedto US dollars 258.6 million (Rs, 26,3 billion).

Post tsunami recovery and reconstruction activities areimplemented under four major programmes; (i) constructionof houses, (ii) restoring livelihood, (iii) providing health,

education and protection and (iv) construction of nationalinfrastructure.Construction of Houses: The total housing requirementwas 87,525 which 32,000 was to be built under the Donor-built Housing Programme (DHP) and the balance 55,525

under the Home Owner Driven Programme (HODP). Under

the DHP, Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) have been

signed for the constructio n of 29 ,640 housing units, of which10,107 units were at various stages of construction by end

2005. Under the HODP, the government has disbursed Rs.3.6billion by end 2005 to grant, in installments, Rs.250,000 for

a fully damaged house and Rs. 100,000 for a partly damaged

house for reconstruction purposes.Restoring Livelihoods: Estimates show that about

150,000 livelyhoods were lost due to the tsunami; about 50per cent in the fisheries sector,45 per cent in the services

sector including tourism, small businesses and trading and

self-employment and 5 per cent in the a-qriculture sector. At

the initial stages, the government affanged a cash grant ofRs.5,000 per household per month and a food ration ofRs.375 per person per week,Financing schemes introduced by the Central Bank ofSri Lanka (CBSL), National Development Trust Fund(NDTF), commercial banks and NGOs helped to restore thelivehhoods in tsunami affected areas. Under the Susahanaloan scheme, CBSL has granted Rs.3.6 billion for 8,000projects through financial institutions by end 2005. NDTF

has granted 5,5'70loans to the value of Rs.700 million. About

90 per cent of 24,185 fishing crafts destroyed or damaged dueto the tsunami have been restored by end 2005. Fast recovery

in the toulism sector also hetped to regain livelihoods of many

persons. By end 2005, about 70-85 per cent of the affectedunemployed had regained their main source of income.Providing Health, Education and Protection: A totalof 97 health facilities were damaged due to the tsunami.Construction of these facilities and provision of essentialmedical supplies, mobilisation of health , diseaseprevention, and addressing mental health were thepriority areas of the health auth w ouof water bome diseases or any ni direported in the affected area as prompt preventive measureswere introduced by the health authorities. MoUs have beensigned with donor agencies for the:fehabilitation of all

damaged health institutions. By end 2005, construction of l0mother and child clinics and a central dispensary Werecompleted. Over 500 community support officers in allaffected districts have been trained to address mental health

needs.

In the education sector, 182 schools were partially ol fully

damaged due to the tsunami directly afTecting 100,000 students.In addition, 446 schools were used as camps affeCting another

100,000 students. MoUs have been signed with donors to rebuild

180 schools, according to a standard child-friendly design.

Construction of 18 schools had commenced by end 2005. Over

75 per cent of construction work of the damaged schools is

expected to be completed by end 2006.: ,

The Department of Probation and Child Care (DPCC)and National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) incoorporation with the relevant tIN agencies and NGOs have

made arrangements for child protection. SCveral legal clinics

caused major dama-ee to roads, railways, electricity, water

supply and to port infrastructure . Approximately 800 kms ofnational roads and 1,500 kms of provincial and rural roads

were damaged. Rehabilitation cost has been estimated at USdollars 356 million. Emergency repairs to dama-qed roads

have been completed. Rehabilitation of the Kalutara- Matara

the previous year. The deceleration came from lower growth

in import trade and the decline in the hotels and restaurants sub-

sector.

Import trade grew by 2.3 per cent in 2005 compared to a 9.0

per cent growth in the previous year. The deceleration was

seen in all three main import categories, namely, consumer

goods, intermediate goods and investment goods. The importof investment goods increased in 2005 by 4.2 per cent in

volume terms compared with an 18.4 per cent in 2004.In this

category building materials, transport equipment and other

investment goods imports increased, while machinery and

equipment imports declined marginally. The volume of

intermediate goods imports grew by 2.7 per cent, mainly drivenby fertiliser imports and imports for the garment industry,

compared to 6.6 per cent growth in2004. Consumer goods

imports increased by 0.9 per cent, as against the 3.9 percentgrowth in the previous year. Of consumer goods imports,

imports of basic food items, such as rice, declined in the lightof the increases in domestic production. Imports of other

consumer goods, which mainly consisted of motor vehicles and

pharmaceutical items and household goods, grew by 2.3 per

cent compared to 8.5 per cent in 2004.

The export trade sub-sector expanded by 6.9 per cent in2005. Despite the phasing out of the MFA, the textiles and

garments sector, which accounts for around 58 per cent of

industrial expofi eamin-es, -{rew by 5.3 per cent. Meanwhile,all other industrial exports, excluding petroleum products,

performed better, and grew by ll.5 per cent. Exports of

agricultural products -erew by 2.9 per cent, led by moderate

-erowth in tea and high growth in minor a-ericultural exports.

Exports ofcoconut products dropped by 9.3 percent as coconut

production contracted by 2.9 percent durin-e the year. Althou-eh

rubber production increased by 10.2 per cent, hi-eher and

increasing demand fiom local rubber-based industries reduced

exports of rubber in primary form. Consequently, rubber based

export income -erew by 37 per cent in current terms durin,q the

year due to hi-sher value addition.

The domestic trade sub-sector, defined as the trading of

domestically produced and traded goods grew by 4.2 per

cent in 2005 as against the 2.0 per cent growth reported inthe previous year.This growth was stimulated by better

perfbrmance in domestic a-qriculture, especially production of

paddy, vegetables, subsidiary food crops and minor export

crops. Fufiher, satisfactory performance in factory industry and

small industries also contributed to this healthy growth in

domestic trade.

The hotels and restaurants sub-sector recorded a drop of

29.0 per cent with a 3 per cent decline in tourist arrivalsduring 2005. The tsunami destroyed 46 registered hotels

(alound 4,000 of 14,350 rooms) in the Southern and Eastern

coastal belt. Most partly damaged hotels were restored during

the year. The total number of arrivals amounted to 549,308 in

2005 compared to the previous year's 566,202. Although tourist

arrivals from Western Europe fell drastically by 20 per cent,

higher arrivals from Asia Oy 12.8 per cent), North America and

Australia offset this decline to a ceftain extent. Anivals from

India were the highest at 113,323 and grew by I per cent over

2004. Traditionally strong UK came second with 92,629

arrivals, a drop by l3 percent during the year. Although the

decline in anivals was modest, foreign guest nights dropped by

40.1 per cent from the 14.4 percent increase recorded in 2004,

as most of these tourists were business and transit travellers

with relatively shorter durations of stay. Meanwhile local guest

nights of all graded hotels recorded a decline of 14.1 per cent.

The transport, storage and communication sector reporteda 12.7 per cent growth during 2005 as against the 13.7

percent grorvth in 2004. This growth was mainly driven by the

growth in telecommunications which continued to expand.

The tefecommunication sub-sector grew further by 27 per

cent during the year with network expansions and nervvalue added services introduced with technological

advancements. This -qrowth was mainly driven by the upward

trend in mobile phone usa-qe and popularisation of Fixed Access

Wireless phones with the latest Code Division Multiple Access

(CDMA) technology and competitive prices among serviceproviders. The traditional Fixed Access Wireline Local Loopsubscriber level increased by I I per cent to around 950,000

subscribers in 2005, compared to a 4.6 per cent growth in 20M.The Fixed Access Wireless Local Loop subscriberlevel expanded throughout the year, recording a growthof 122per cent to increase to nearly 290,000 subscribers. Internetand email usage, which reported 9 per cent growth in 2004,recorded a significant increase of 23 per cent in 2005. Mobilephone usage increased by 52 per cent over 2004 and

the subscriber level of mobile users had exceeded 3.3 million.Therefore, the mobile penetration ratio (mobile connectionsper 100 people) increased to around l7 at end 2005 fromll at end 20M.

The Cargo handling, storage and warehousing sub-sectorgrew by 9.8 per cent as against 12.8 per cent growth in theprevious year. The deceleration was mainly due to lowergrowth in domestic throughput volumes handled by theColombo Port compared to the previous year. During the year,

the Colombo Port, including the South Asia Gateway Terminal(SAGT), handled a volume of 2,455,295 TEUs, a 10.5 per centincrease over the previous year. This is the highest recordedTEUs handled by the Colombo port. Transshipment volumes,which account for over two thirds of the total throughputhandled, expanded by 12.7 per cent compared to 13.5 per centgrowth in2004. The domestic throughput volume grew by 7.2per cent, as against the 17 percent growth in the previous year,

as import growth decelerated. Air cargo volumes grewmoderately by 3.6 per cent reflecting the expansion in theaviation industry.

The Transport sub-sector, one ofthe largest service sectorsin the economy, grew by 3.3 per cent as against4.2 per centin the previous year. This deceleration reflected poorperformance in bus and rail passenger transport and moderateexpansion in the air travel category in 2005. Passengerkilometers operated by Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) dropped by7 per cent compared with a 1.7 per cent growth in 2004. The

adverse impact of the tsunami on rail transport and its reducedoperated kilometers resulting from the heavy damage to the

southern coastal rail track in December2004 were reflected in

the decline in the number of passenger kilometers operated bySLR in 2005.In public transport, the growth performance in theprivate bus category improved marginally, while that of the SriLanka Transport Board contracted. However, other private

transport services, including three wheelers, hiring vehicles andprivate vehicles, reported considerable growth. Total passengerkilometers f'lown by Sri Lankan Airlines and other domesticairlines increased by 2.8 per cent, despite multiple crises,including the tsunami catastrophe and high fuel prices thatimpacted heavily on the aviation industry. Road haulage grewby 4.2 per cent, reflecting the expansion in goods transport

activities with significant increases in domestic production and

more moderate growth in import trade.G Financial services, real estate and business servicesperformed well, recording a growth of 6.5 per cent, whilecontributingl2.T per cent to the overall GDP growth. Thegrowth in financial services was mainly responsible for thisgrowth.o Financial services reported a 7.5 per cent growth during theyear, while the banking sector alone grew by 3.8 per cent.Although lending rates did not increase significantly in 2005,

the interest income of the banking sector reported a22percentincrease in current terms, reflecting high credit growth.However, non-interest income from foreign exchange business

and dividends on securities and investments dropped. Insurance

and other financial services grew by 10.2 percent during theyear with a significant increase in income from the leasing andhire purchase portfolio of finance companies and satisfactoryperformance in other financial institutions.o Real estate, renting and business services, which recordeda 1.7 per cent growth in 2004, grew by 2.8 per cent,reflecting the continuing demand for such services. Anumber of companies involved in real estate development,including condominium and other types of housing projects,reported high profits for the year 2005. Business serviceactivities, which included advertising services and computer

software development activities, also recorded higher growth.o Public administration, other government services anddefence, other community, social and personal servicesgrew by 5.4 per cent as against an increase of 3.9 per centduring the previous year. The intake of 42,000 unemployed

graduates to the public sector in the fourth quarter of 20M was

assigned to different government institutions during the year,

over one third of whom were absorbed into the government

education service. The added output from this expansion was

reflected in the public administration sub-sector, which grew by

5.1 in 2005, as against the 2.0 per cent growth in the previousyear. The other community, social and personal servicessub-sector recorded a growth of 6.0 per cent partly due tohealthy growth in the private health care industry and

increased by 16.8 per cent to Rs.2,585 billion (at currentmarket prices) in 2005. In 20M, the GDE (aggregate domesticdemand) increased by 18.4 per cent. The GDE, which is the

sum of consumption and investment expenditure of the private

and public sectors of the economy, grew by 4.7 per cent in realterms in comparison to 6.5 per cent in 2004. In 2005,

consumption grew at a somewhat slower pace in real terms.

Investment growth continued to be hi-eher than consumption

growth in both nominal and real terms. The GDP at market

prices, which is the sum of the GDE and net imports, was

estimated at Rs. 2,366 billion, an increase of 16.6 per cent.

Consumptione Conzumption expenditure increased by 14.8 per cent to Rs.

1,959 billion in 2005. This increase is a culmination of the

growth of real consumption by 2.9 per cent and average price

levels increasing by lt.5 per cent. Of the total consumption,

Private Consumption Expenditure (PCE) increased by 14.4 per

cent over a growth of 14.9 per cent in2004, while government

consumption expenditure rose by 18.3 per cent over a growth

of 18,4 per cent in2004. The share of PCE remained around 90

per cent of total consumption expenditure in 2005. Of the total

PCE, expenditure on locally produced goods and services

increased by 18.6 per cent while that on imported goods and

non-factor services increased by a.6 per cent.o The share of food and non-alcoholic beverages in PCE

declined marginally during 2005 to 32.3 per cent of totalexpenditure. This yet again confirms that with improvingliving standards household expenditure is being diversifiedfrom this basic need into other areas, particularly towards

services. With price levels of most food items increasing, the

nominal expenditure on this category grew by 13.5 per cent.

Due to the decline in fish production, consumption of otherprotein items such as meat and eggs increased. The

consumption of starchy food, cereals and pulses also increased

perhaps due to their higher production in 2005.

Expenditure on two other basic needs, clothing and housing

and related services, grew in a range of 9 to 14 per cent in

nominal terms. The spending on clothing and footwear, which

includes readymade -qarments, clothing material, other clothing

accessories and footwear, grew by 9 per cent, with consumption

of locally produced -eoods increasin-{ at a higher rate than that

of imported goods. Expenditure on household services such as

household repairs, water, electricity, gas and fuel increased byl0 per cent with rising prices.

Although the share of expenditure on alcoholic beverages,

tobacco and narcotics declined during the previous year,expenditure increased by 13 per cent in 2005. This

consumption increase was reflected in the production and

expansion of alcoholic beverages as well. However, with

excise duties being revised upwards, the share of expenditure

remained al most unchan-{ed.

Nominal expenditure on transport, education and healthgrew in a range of 12-15 per cent. In an environment of

increasing fuel prices, expenditure on transport grew by l2 per

cent compared to a contraction of I per cent in 2004.

Expenditure on both transport services, as well as operation of

personal transport equipment, increased due to the upward

revisions of bus and railway fares and higher fuel prices, but

consumer spending on vehicle purchases had declined due to

higher price levels of motor vehicles with the introduction of

higher import tariffs during the latter part of 2004. Expenditure

growth on education, which had recorded the hi-ehest growth in2004 owing to private expenditure increasing with the

expansion in private tuition and private education institutions,

decelerated to some extent in 2005.

The highest growth category in PCE was communication

services with a growth of 63.2 per cent in nominal terms.

The increased consumer spendin_e on communication services

is in tandem with the rapid expansion of the telecommunication

sector in response to the continued demand for frxed and mobilephones and othel advanced products in communicationtechnology.

Although expenditure on recreation and entertainment andrestaurants and hotels increased by over 15 per centrespectively, the growth momentum had slowed downrelative to 2004. The impact of the tsunami was felt in the

decline in local tourists within the recreation sector. However,

expenditure on miscellaneous goods and services had grown byl7 per cent.

The above analysis of PCE revealed that most consumptioncategories grew in real terms during 2005. With thecontinued expansion of per capita inc<;me, consumption of

services grew at a higher rate than that of most goods. This, yetagain, confirms the changing life styles of the Sri Lankanpopulation with development. Consumption is shiftin_e from

basic needs towards services.

Government consumption increased at a similar rate in2005 compared to 2004. The expansion in government

expenditure was due to increased consumption of goods and

services as well increased expenditure on salaries and wages.In the aftermath of the tsunami, govemment expenditure rosewith spending on humanitarian aid and rehabilitation work,which was necessary to sustain and rebuild livelihoods affectedby the tsunami. The intake of 42,000 graduates to thegovernment sector, as well as the public sector salary increase

durin,e the latter part of 2004. had a bearing on the government

wage bill in 2005.

Investmentc Investment expenditure (gross domestic capital formation)at current market prices was estimated at Rs.626 billion,an increase of 23.5 per cent over 2004. In real terms

investment gew by 10.8 percent. The investment to GDPratioimproved to 265 per cent from 25 per cent in 2004. This wasentirely on account of government investment, which rose by

119.4 per cent, whereas private investment grew by 14.l per

cent.e Meanwhile, imports of investment goods rose moderately,after two years of significantly high growth. In 2003 and2004, private investment had risen significantly in areas such

as telecommunications, transportation and factory industriesfollowing the ceasefire, as well as in readiness for removal ofthe MFA, resulting in a high base effect. Although the importof investment goods recorded a marginal decline of 0.2 per centduring the first half of 2005, it grew at a faster pace in the

second half of the year to register an annual growth rate of 4.2per cent in volume terms. This growth was over a high base,following the 18.4 per cent growth in2004. Consequently,unlike in the previous two years, in 2005, government

investment played a significant role in investment growth.r In the aftermath of the tsunami devastation, public sector,

as well as private sector investment had been channeled intourgently required rehabilitation and reconstructionactivities in tsunami-affected areas. Govemment investment

had been channeled to reconstruction of roads. rail and other

during the year in construction of temporary housing or shelters

and later, permanent housing facilities and other relief work.

Private investment expenditure expanded by 14.1 per centin 2005 and accounted for 84 per cent of total investment.

However, while the government investment to GDP ratio rose

sharply, the private investment to GDP ratio fell from22.8 per

cent in 2004 to 22.3 per cent in 2005, as that of public

corporations and private investment both declined marginally.Apart from private investment that flowed in for tsunami

reconstruction work, including rebuilding of affected hotels,

other industrial and services sector activities also attractedinvestments towards productivity improvements, capacity

expansion and start up new industries,

Foreign direct investment inflows to Sri Lanka, increasedby 22.6 per cent to US dollars 287 million in 2005, around

5 per cent of total investment. The BOI, the main investment

promotion institution of the country, approved 374 projects in

2005 under Sections l6 and l7 of the BOI Act with an

investment commitment of Rs. 79.4 billion, compared to 526

projects approved in 2004 with an investment commitment of

Rs. 142.3 billion. The decline in both the local and foreign

components of approved projects was mainly due to strict

screening procedures followed by the BOI. While the numberof projects contracted under Section I7 of the BOI Act

decreased to 167 in 2005 from228 in 2004, the value of

contracted investment increased by 8 pr cent to Rs. 74,3 billion

in 2005 on account of the high value of the domestic investmentcomponent. The realised investment in BOI industries

amounted to Rs. 6l billion in 2005 reaching a cumulative

realised investment of Rs. 380 billion as at end 2005.

Of the 374 projects approved under Sections 16 and l7 of

the BOI Act in 2005, 150 were foreign owned and 119 werejoint ventures, while Sri Lankans owned the rest. The non-

factory industry sectors continued to be the major recipients of

investment flows, particularly in the new growth areas of real

estate, communication, hotels and restaurants and business

services. These sectors attracted 245 approved projects with an

investment commitment of Rs 53 billion in 2005. The factoryindustry sector absorbed 126 approved projects with an

investment commitment of Rs. 26 billion in 2005. Of the

approved projects in this sector in 2005, the largest share ofinvestment was absorbed by food, beverage and tobacco

products (15 projects) followed by textile wearing apparel and

leather products (34 projects), fabricated metal products (20projects) and chemical, rubber and plastic products (12

projects).

The number of enterprises in commercial operation has

declined marginally from 2,360 in 2004 to 2,338 in 2005.

Among the factory industry sub-sectors, 390 projects were in

the textiles, wearing apparel and leather products category, 190

in the food, beverages and tobacco products category, and 187in the chemical, rubber and plastics products category. The

share of foreign investment commitment for these projects was

53 per cent of the total investment. Of these operating projects,

Availability and Utilisation of ResourcesI The total available resources, which consist of GDP

(domestic resources) and imports of goods and non-factor

services (foreign resources), were estimated at Rs. 31377billion at current market prices. This is an increase of 14.4

per cent over the previous year. This increase was generated

by an increase of Rs. 336 billion in domestic resources and Rs.

90 billion in foreign r€sources. In real terms, the availability

of resources grew by 4.9 per cent, lower than in the previous

year. This includes real growth of domestic resources by 6.0 per

cent and import of goods and non-factor services by 3 per cent.

the share proyided by domestic economic activities was 68

per cent, while the rest was imported. The supply of domesticservices, with a 38 per cent share, outperformed that ofdomestic goods at 30 per cent, where the value of tradingactivities, transport, communication and financial servicescontributed significantly. In contrast, the supply of imports

consisted mainly of goods at 28 per cent, with a share of 4 per

cent for imports of services.

Of the total demand for goods and services, the share of

consumption in current terms stood at 57 per cent andcapital formation at 19 per cent, with exports at 24 per cenLMeanwhile, of the total domestic demand, the private sector

continued to account for around 90 percent of consumption, but

a lower share, 84 per cent, of investment than in the previousyear, following the considerable expansion in government

rnvestment.

Savingso Both domestic and national savings grew at significantlyhigher rates compared with 20M. Domestic savings rose due

to the increase in private corporate sector savings resulting fromimproved efficiency and productivity and a significant

improvement in government dis-savings. The higher influx of

worker remittances from overseas raised the growth in national

savings. Meanwhile, the resource gap, the difference between

domestic savings and investment, as a ratio of GDP, increasedslightly from 9.1 per cent to 9.3 per cent with the growth in the

cent over the previous year.The increase in domestic savings'

was due to the improvement in private savings by 17 .4 per cent.As in 2004, increased corporate savings, through higherprofitability, provided the impetus for this high growth in

private savings. Government savings, which is defined as thecurent account balance of the government budget, was negativebut improved by 18.7 per cent compared to 2004. This was

achieved through higher revenue generation and the debt

moratorium on ceftain foreign debt service payments after the

tsunami. The domestic savings ratio (domestic savings/GDP)

increased to 17 .2 per cent in 2005 from 15.9 per cent recordedin2004.o National savings, the sum of domestic savings, net factorincome from abroad (NFIA) and net foreign private

transfers increased by 25.8 per cent to Rs. 551 billion. NFLA

continued to be negative and deteriorated at a faster rate to Rs.

30 billion in 2005. This was mainly due to exchange losses

exceeding gains in income from higher interest rates, with theappreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee in December 2005

compared to December2004. The decline was despite the debt

moratorium received for certain foreign loans after the tsunami.

However, net private transfers, the other component of national

savings, which consists of worker remittances, improved at a

higher rate of 28 per cent to Rs. 174 billion, thereby completely

off-setting the negative impact of the deterioration in NFIA.

Consequently, the national savings ratio (national savings/

GDP) increased to 23.3 per cent in 2005 from 21.6 in 2004.

2.5 Policies and lssues

Agricultural policy has to maintain balance between the two

objectives of making available affordable and high quality

food and non-food products for consumers and industries

and raising farmerst incomes. The nature of the Agriculturesector in many developing countries is that it providesemployment opportunities for the rural masses

disproportionately to its value addition to the country. Thus, toensure employment and to safeguard the livelihood of

agricultural producers, countries tend to protect the agricultural

sector from external competition through tarifl subsidies and

other measures. These unsustainable measures incur an extra

cost on consumption and a burden on budgetary resources. Less

burdensome and sustainable measures that countries adopt are

enhancing productivity, improving infrastructure, developing Onew varieties through research, propagation of new technology

and research outcome through extension services, reducing

post-harvest losses and developing market based methods to

deal with price fluctuations.

Agriculture sector development in Sri Lanka is inhibited by

a series of inherent problems. Major problems include thefragmentation and limited extent of land inhibiting the

realisation of economies of scale, the difticulty in competing for

factors of production with the Industry and Services sectors and

withstanding domestic and international competition for frnalproducts. International developments in technology continue

to depress commodity prices, while expansion in other sectorsdomestically as well as internationally raises the demand forinputs such as land and labour, thereby raising the cost ofproduction. In view of these constraints, some countries withlimited land area, such as Sin-{apore, opted out of traditional

agriculture very early, and others such as the USA, Japan and

the EU continue to provide substantial subsidies and protectionto their agriculture, while promoting value added agriculturethrough technology and research. The limitations onagricultural development could be faced successfully tkough

the development of more liberal factor and product markets,

maintaining policy consistency and predictability, developing

infrastructure, upgradin g research and development, adopting

higher technology, and expanding extension services.

Both the government and the private sector have to playcomplementary roles in developing agriculture. Thegovernment has to establish a suitable re-eulatory frameworkwhile providing infrastructure facilities and engaging in

research and development activities particularly when such

services and activities are too costly to be provided by the

private sector or are of a 'public goods' nature.

The budgetary burden arising from subsidies and thewelfare cost of excessive protection of domestic agriculture

has to be gradually eliminated through improvements inproductivity towards self-sustainability of the sector.

Subsidies are contentious issues, not only in Sri Lanka, but in

other countries as well. The cost of subsidies has to be borneby the public since it has to be met through current or futuretaxation. Subsidies to producers finally benefit consumers aswell, through lower costs of production, while both producers

and consumers are affected by the ensuing taxation. Protectionof domestic production through tariff increases on imports,

especially on food items, affects the poor the most. The cunentfertiliser subsidy scheme, specifically to paddy farmers, has

several other drawbacks as well, as the process incurs high

administrative costs for monitoring and controlling leakages to

other sectors. A ferlitiser stamps scheme for targeted smallfarmers will provide a more effective mechanism untilproductivity is raised to the required levels.

Equally important as productivity improvements are efforts

required to meet international standards for processes and

products, as well as to eliminate unfair trading practices by

other countries. An important issue emerged in 2005 with theEU planning to implement new food hygiene legislation with

effect from I January 2006, which includes the application of

the HACCP standards. Though the effective date was extendedtill June 2006, this could have an impact on agriculture exports,

especially on tea, unless the required factory modernisations are

completed on time. Many developed countries provide

excessive protection to agriculture through subsidies, tariff and

other safeguard measures, which could have a detrimental effect

on domestic producers in developing countries. Sri Lanka

should continue to use multilateral fora to address those issues.

In the wake of global concerns and media publicityregarding fast spreading diseases, such as bird flu, the

country should adopt strict quarantine measures and other

safety precautions, while also raising public awareness ofreal versus perceived threats to the country. Awareness

programmes on the impoftance and techniques of bio safety forpoultry farmers as well as the general public, while

strengthening technical capacities for the same, is important tomitigate potential damage to poultry production from the

disease, as well as from adverse, inaccurate public perceptions

about the spread of the disease.

Marketing of paddy becomes difficult and paddy prices

decline sharply, soon after the peak harvesting period when

there is a glut in the market, thereby depriving farmers of

a dependable income. With a view to maintaining the market

price at a reasonable level, the government intervened in the

market at a specified purchasing price. However, govemment

efforts were not adequate, largely due to shortage of state funds,

insufficient transport and storage infrastructure and inadequate

systems for sustainable purchase and disposal mechanisms,

including cash-flow management. The persistent drop in farm

gate prices of paddy at the time of harvesting indicates the

absence of competitive market forces. This could be due to

anti-competitive practices prevailing in the regions of paddycultivation. Therefore, the government needs to carefully

examine the market practices to bring about a lasting market

based solution to the low farm-gate prices of paddy during

harvesting season.

Weak extension services inhibit the conveyance of research

and development findings to cultivation. Changes in theinstitutional framework and withdrawal of the agriculture

extension offices at the village level have hindered the effectiveflow of information between researchers, agricultural

administrators and farmers. The gap created between farmers

and researchers has led to lower adoption of new research

findin-es and technologies, thereby depriving the sector of

opportunities for productivity enhancement, While recentpolicy action taken in this regard is commendable for its

timeliness, adequate planning and co-ordination for such

extension service delivery, with accountability, is urgently

required:

Several impediments have prevented the industrial sector

from attaining its maximum growth potential. These include

insufficient skilled human capital, inadequate infrastructure

facilities, particularly energy, roads and railways, high costs of

energy, insufficient progress in restructuring public sector

enterprises, concerns relating to law and otder, labour marketrigidities and the absence of proper bankruptcy legislation.While successive governments have recognised these

constraints and attempted to address them, the effective

outcome has been inadequate. Better co-ordination and

commitment to longer term goals would be required if thecountry's potential for industrial sector growth is to be

achieved.

Poor service delivery with regard to regulatoryrequirements and legal proceedings have increased

business transaction costs, including litigation costs. Theseinclude time-consuming reporting requirements and

burdensome approval procedures, in addition to long delaysin court proceedings, complexity of existing laws and lack of

adequate commercial courts in the country. At the

same time, the lack of proper legal provisions to protect

the environment is also becoming a cause for concern, withthe rise in environmental pollution created by industrialwaste. A review of existing laws with regard to expansionof the industrial sector and related issues, includingenvironmental concerns, and their implementation, is

required for lon-e-term sustainability of industrial expansionin the country.

The narrow concentration of industries increases thevulnerability to exogenous shocks on industry. The

industrial sector in Sri Lanka has concentrated on a few product

categories such as apparel, rubber based products, ceramics and

processed foods. The removal of existing impediments to the

expansion of other industrial sectors will lead to a more broad

based and resilient industrial sector.

The economic growth in 2005 was higher than thegrowth in 2004 and reflected both the resilience andthe vulnerability of the country's economic structure.The tsunami affected around 3 per cent of the

population adversely and two sectors, fishing and tourism, thatcontribute less than 5 per cent of the economicoutput. However, displaying resilience, the final growthoutcome in 2005 was similar to that expected priorto the tsunami due to higher than projected growth in

another sector, namely, agriculture. At the same time, a

breakdown of the outcome in 2005 indicates vulnerability, as

the higher GDP growth was mainly due to the favourable

weather conditions in 2005 which were conducive to higher

domestic agricultural output and more value addition in

electricity generation with the increased share of hydro electric

power generation. The contribution from these two sectors

more than made up for the drop in contribution from the fishing

and hotel and restaurant sub-sectors. as well as the lower

contribution from import trade.

Box 7Avian Flu and its Impact on Sri Lanka

There is growing concem about the possibility of an avian flupandemic (AFP) and its implications for humans and theglobal economic and financial system.l Avian flu is aninfectious disease caused by strains of the influenza virus,which was first identified in birds about a century ago in Italy.Health experts are particularly concerned about the currentstrain of the virus H5Nl. This strain has spread quickly inbird populations, caused high mortality among poultry, andoccasionally infected humans, with about half of the casesproving fatal. But human infections remain rare as the strain

has not been spreading easily from birds to humans, nor hasit been spreading from person to person.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO),

evolution in influenza viruses cannot be predicted. Hence, it

is difficult to know if or when a virus such as H5N1 might

become easily transmittable among humans and its severity.However, the WHO considers that, once a virus mutates intoa form that allows for efficient human-to-human

transmission, a pandemic could occur. Because of high globalmobility and interconnection, illness could spread quickly,

and, if the virus has a high fatality rate, threaten millions oflives around the world. The pandemic might emerge inrepetitive waves with varying intensity, including durationsbeyond 6 weeks, r$ was the experience with past pandemics.The outbreak of the H5N1 in Hong Kong inl997resulted in severe destruction to its poultry industry andcaused 6 human deaths. Recent outbreaks of the diseasebegan in 2003 in several South East Asian countries andspread to 47 countries (as at 21 March 2006), includingEurope, the Middle East and Africa. All reported humaninfections in those countries are among those who have haddirect contact with dead or live infected birds.Sri Lanka has not had any cases of H5N1 so far; butremains vulnerable, as countries around Sri T anka such asIndia, Pakistan, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia,Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam have contacted the disease.It could be brought into the country by migratory birds,imported birds and poultry products and tourists arrivingfrom affected countries. As in many Asian countries, SriLankan rural families keep backyard chicken causing highrisk of spreading the disease to humans. Another high-risk

area is live poultry markets, where chances of contacting thevirus to humans are higher.Poultry is one of the most important sources of dietaryprotein in Sri Lanka, and the industry provides employmentto about 75,000 persons directly and to about one millionpeople indirectly. Those indirectly involved include feed

producers and millers who supply inputs to the industry.About 80 per cent of the poultry farmers fall into the smallfarmer category, while the balance 20 per cent belong tomedium to large-scale category. Consumer demand forpoultry meat and eggs has declined significantly with thespread of the Avian flu in neighbouring countries thereby

causing prices to drop below the cost of production, adverselyaffecting poultry farmers, input producers and their families.The Department of Animal Production and Health(DAPH) has already taken preventive measures by restrictingimports of live birds and poultry products from affectedcountries. Veterinary surgeons have been urged to be vigilant

and report any cases of high mortality rates in poultry farmsimmediately. The DAPH has initiated active surveillance in'hot spots' where migratory birds have habitats in waterreservoirs. Funds have been allocated to start preventionprogrammes and to strengthen the capacities of the DAPH byimproving laboratory facilities and testing facilities, whichwould facilitate early detection and prevention of the disease.The DAPH, together with other relevant organisations have.

started awareness progammes to educate poultry farmers andother stakeholders on the symptoms of the disease and, steps

to be taken if there is any suspicion of infection among birds.The Ministry of Health has established the NationalTechnical Committee on Avian Influenza (NTCAI) tocompile a National Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Plan(NfPPP) in collaboration with DAPH and other relevantministries. The Plan sets out the strategies and activities to beundertaken by the Ministry of Health in close collaboratiolwith other relevant key ministries, to prevent an outbreak ofthe disease and in the event of an outbreak, to control the

spread of the disease. NIPPP identified fiVe key strategies forpreparedness and response fo the pandemic of avianinfluenza- It includes:- Planning and coordination: defines the roles andresponsibilities of agencies involved in implementingpreparedness plan and coordinated procedure for decisionmaking.- Surveillance and early warning: consists ofstrengthening of disease surveillance in animals and humans

and strengthening of laboratories.- Prevention and control: consists of specific approachesfor minimising the spread of influenza rn humans byimplementation of public health measures, availability andstockpiles of vaccines.- Response of Health system:consists of reinforcing thehealthcare system to adequately deal with the increaseddemand'on hospitals and health services required for anemerging pandemic.

- Risk communication: consists of a comprehensivecommunication strategy to provide updated information to thepublic, healthcare personnel, and other stakeholders durinp

each pandemic phase.The Director General of Health Services has alreadyissued 'Guidelines for the Preparedness and Response to anAvian Influenza Pandemic Thleat' to all relevantofficials includin-e details of the disease identification,control and preventive,measures. The estimated fundingrequirement for the activities of the Ministry of Healthcareand Nutrition and the DAPH to implement the plan for athree-year period (2005106 -2008) is approximately USdollars 7.5 million. Financial and technical constraints existfor implementing pandemic preparedness plan as adequatequantities of necessary antiviral drugs, vaccines andnecessary laboratory equipment and hospital facilities arestill not available.

Box 7 (Contd.)

The severity of a pandemic on an economy depends on

the capacity and the level of preparedness of the healthcaresystem of a country. It also depends on the availability offinancial resources to pulchase and distnbute drugs, vaccines,and facilities etc. fbr timely treatment and possible travelrestrictions. There are potential fiscal implications to the

economy due to upfront cost enhancement for healthcarefacilities on preventive and curative measures, stockpile offood items for preparedness planning, compensationpayments for losses from culling birds in poultry industry

durin-q pre-pandemic period, losses in tourism and loss ofrevenue from business performance during the pandemicperiod.

Considering the economic implications of the possibilityof an avian flu pandemic (AFP), it is necessary to prepareBusiness Continuity Plans (BCP), covering all keyinstitutions to carryout their services without intenuption.

Economic growth that is signifrcantly dependent on weatherfor a better performance in agriculture and power

generation is not sustainable in the long term. Consequently,

a stron-eer commitment to longer term sustainable economic

development goals that includes infi'astructure improvements

and chan-ees to legislation and its efl'ective implementation, thatwere outlined earlier for expansion of both the industrial andagricultural sectors, and are as relevant to the services sector,

is a key policy priority for Sri Lanka to reach a higher growth

path of 6-8 per cent.

On the expenditure front, real growth in both external anddomestic demand provided the impetus for the growth inoutput. While the growth in external demand had moderatedfiom 2004, it remained healthy in the face of aggressive _qlobalcompetition. This reflects the concerted efforts made atproductivity improvements and cost cuttin_q through skills

development and introduction of new technolo,eies in private

manufacturin-q and the success of their restructuring process to

meet -elobal challenges. With the giant economies of Asia,

India and China, expanding at a very fast pace, this productivity

improvement process will need to continue to ensure continuity

in external demand for Sri Lankan products.

The impetus to output from domestic demand, bothconsumption and investment, had also moderatedcompared to the euphoric situation in the two years

following the ceasefrre. Durin_{ 2003 and 2004, output gew to

meet the pent-up demand across the country, where total

domestic demand grew in real terms at over 8 per cent and 6 per

cent, respectively, Further expansion in productive investmentand higher productivity levels, together with real and

sustainable growth in domestic demand for goods and services,would si-enify hi-eher levels of economic development in thecountry. It is essential that government policies focus on

creatin-e a holistic enabling environment towards achieving this

overall growth momentum.a While it is necessary for successive governments to address

the problems of the consumer and the domestic producer inthe short term, as important is the need to addressimpediments to future capacity expansion through

expansion in productive investment. The slow down in non-

consumer imports, both intermediate and investment goods, in

2005 cannot be taken lightly, as both categories are leadin_q

indicators of future economic activity and expansion. In certainsectors, the growth had slowed down due to capacitylimitations. while in other sectors, the growth was belowachievable potential due to inadequate infrastructure and

inefficient processes and procedures. Here again, Sri Lanka can

only achieve a sustainable high growth path, if priority is -{ivento improve on existing infrastructure facilities, processes and

procedures tbr smooth functioning of labour, capital, land and

-eoods markets, consistent with the potential for expansion in

those sectors that have the capacity to do so.
