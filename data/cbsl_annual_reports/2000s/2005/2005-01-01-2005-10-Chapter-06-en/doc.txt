FISCAL POLICY AND GOVERNMENT FINANCE

6.1 Overviewo Fiscal policy thrust in 2005 was placed on achieving the pro-poor and pro-growth development objectives of thegovernment while supporting a speedy recovery of the

economy from the unexpected tsunami disaster and movingtowards fiscal sustainability in the medium to long term.

Fiscal policy was formulated within the overall development

strategy of the government aimed at achieving a hrgher level of

economic and social development. Fiscal policy focussed onachieving targets stipulated in the Fiscal Mana-{ement(Responsibility) Act (FMRA) of 2003, in the medium term,

strengthening the post tsunami recovery process, increasingpublic investment and strengthening strategic public

enterprises. The objectives of fiscalpolicy had to be met in theface of escalating oil prices, relatively high inflationary

pressures, rising interest rates, shortfall in pnvatisation proceeds

and lower foreign progranrme financing.I The economy recovered responding well to fiscal policy

measures complemented by other macroeconomic policies,

and the tsunami recovery progressed, with some positive

developments in the fiscal consolidation process. Tsunami

recovery process moved forward with budgetary support as well

as the support of donors, Non Governmental Organisations

(NGOs), and the private sector. The declining trend in revenueto GDP ratio reversed in 2005. Public investment also

increased to 6.3 per cent of the GDP from 4.8 per cent in 2004.

However, the cunent expenditure rose higher than the revised

target leading to a budget deficit of 8.7 per cent of GDP in 2005,

which is higher than the revised budgetary target of 8.2 per cent.

The budget deficit was financed through domestic resources(5.2 per cent of GDP) and foreign resources (3.4 per cent of

GDP). The debt moratorium helped contain the expansion in

the domestic borrowings.

The outstanding government debt as a ratio of GDP

declined to 93.9 per cent from 105.5 per cent in2004,but thelevel of debt increased by Rs.82.8 billion. This decline wasmainly due to the appreciation of the rupee against major

foreign cunencies and higher growth in nominal GDP. Though

the debt as a ratio of GDP declined in 2005 it still remains high,indicating the need for measures to strengthen fiscal

consolidation process in achieving fiscal sustainability in the

medium to long term.

The government intends to continue with growth anddevelopment objectives while strengthening the fiscalconsolidation process as outlined in the Medium TermFiscal Strategy (MTFS) presented with the Budget 2006.

Key objectives are maintaining a healthy $owth in government

revenue, rationalising recunent expenditure, tuming around the

government's current account deficit to a surplus and reducing

domestic borrowings to about 2 per cent of the GDP in the

medium term, thereby releasing more funds for private andpublic sector investment in vital sectors of the economy to

realise the ultimate objectives of generating higher economicgrowth, creating productive employment, reducing regional

disparity and alleviating poverty.

6.2 Fiscal Policy Direction and Measures

The policy thrust in 2005 was focussed on achieving the pro-poor and pro-growth development objectives of thegovernment, supporting a speedy recovery of the economyfrom the unexpected tsunami disaster, strengthening the

fiscal consolidation process, enhancing public investment

and strengthening strategic public enterprises. The tsunami

recovery process be-qan with the urgent relief and rehabilitation

activities and the subsequent reconstruction. The strengtheningof the fiscal consolidation process was attempted through

measures to augment revenue, rationalise recurrent expenditure

and improve debt management. Public investment policy

emphasised increased allocation of resources for infrastructure

and rural development while increasing the utilisation of

available foreign resources. The strengthening of strategicpublic enterprises was continued through the Strategic

Enterprise Management A-eency (SEMA),

The pro-poor and pro-growth development objectives of the

government are to be achieved through the development of

social and economic infrastructure facilities, creatingemployment and income generating opportunities for thepoor and by minimising regional imbalances indevelopment. These objectives and goals are to be achievedthrough a number of measures namely, projects andprogrammes to develop community water supply, ruralelectrification and housing, development of selected areas,upgrading rural roads, development of irrigation facilities,developing dairy villages, conrmunity development, rebuildingthe conflict affected areas through rehabilitarion andreconstruction of basic infrastructure facilities, speedy

resettlement and support of livelihood of people affected by theconflict, promoting socio economic activities for Samurdhibeneficiaries and by encouraging economic opportunitiesthrough developing entrepreneurship.* The government implemented a series of relief measuresand established several institutions in 2005 to support thepeople affected by the tsunami disaster and to coordinatethe relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts of thegovernment. The relief measures included a grant ofRs.15,000 to the family of a person who losr his/her life, aweekly grant of Rs.200 per person in cash and a dry food rationof Rs.l75 per person, a grant of Rs.2,500 per family to buykitchen utensils, periodic allowances of Rs.5,000 for a familyand Rs.2,500 for a single member family and grants ofRs.250,000 and Rs.100,000 as compensation for fully andpartly damaged houses, respectively. Measures were also takento restore livelihoods, repair and upgrade damagedinfrastructure and resolve problems particularly those related tohealth, education and protection of tsunami victims. Severalinstitutions were set up to coordinate and facilitate efforts of thegovernment, private sector and the donor community. Theentities established at the beginning of 2005 were rhe TaskForce forRebuild the Nation (TAFREN), Task Force for Relief(TAFOR) and Tsunami Housing Reconstruction Unit (THRU).In November 2005, the government replaced TAFREN,TAFOR, and THRU with the Reconstruction and DevelopmentAgency (RADA), which was mandated to acceleratereconstruction and development activities.f An integral part of strengthening the f,rscal consolidationprocess was augmenting the revenue of the government. Aseries of measures were introduced to augment revenuecollection (both tax and non-tax), as increasing revenue is a keyto achieving overall fiscal consolidation. The main measuresundertaken to increase tax revenue were improving taxadministration, and the implementation of measures to improve

revenue from income taxes, VAT, excise taxes, import dutiesand other taxes. To au-ement non-tax revenue, administration

fees and char_{es, and fines and penalties were revised upward.The Taxation Cluster of the National Council for Economic

Development (NCED) continued its activities in 2005. TheTaxation Cluster was involved in facilitatin-e the overall taxpolicy reforms and their effective implementation,e Improvements in tax administration were achieved througha series of measures. These measures included theimprovements of internal arran_qements at the Inland RevenueDepartment (IRD), including the appoinrment of a threemember committee of tax commissioners to certify everyrefund made by the IRD, to rationalise the VAT refundmechanism, establishing an appeals unit under a separatecommissioner, the introduction of a code of ethics and conductto improve the accountability of employees at the IRD, settingup of an information centre at the IRD to collect and analyseinformation on tax evasion, the appointment of a taxombudsman to address grievances of taxpayers and takenecessary remedial measures, stren-ethening the surveillancemechanism and inau_Qurating four dedicated tax courts.t The main measures taken to raise income tax were theenhancement of the tax base, rationalisation of tax rates andexemptions, and introduction of new tax compliancemeasures. To enhance the income tax base a withholding tax

on the registration of motor vehicles and a presumptive tax onNGOs, other than those canying out activities solely related torehabilitation work in the Northern and Eastern provinces, wereintroduced. A Social Responsibility Levy (SRL) was alsoimposed on taxes other than VAT, Port and AirportsDevelopment Levy (PAL), Debit tax and withholding rax oninterest.r Changes were introduced to the personal income tax

system by increasin_g the number of tax slabs from four to sevenwhile rationalising the taxation of employment benefits.Coryorate income taxes were rationalised mainly through thechanges introduced to the tax on dividends that are notdistributed, removal of deductions allowed for VAT paymentson financial services in calculating taxable income, and therationalisation of expenses and allowances allowed in selecteditems. Meanwhile, the Economic Service Charge (ESC) oncertain categories was reduced in consideration of thedifficulties faced by wholesale and retail traders. New taxcompliance measures included rewarding honest taxpayers andmakin-g the Tax Clearance Certificate mandatory forgovemment tenders.r The VAT system was reformulated through theintroduction of a 4-band VAT system, which involved addin-q

a new rate (18 per cent) from January 2005. The other VAT

rates are: basic rate of 5 per cent, the general rate of l5 per cent

and the zero rate for exports. With eff-ect from August 2005, the1 The objeclive ol imposing lhe SRL is to provide necessary financial support for theNalional Aclion Plan for Children (NPC). The NPC has been launched by thegovernmenl to ensure universal access to services that children require for their fulland free development and to provide them with the opportunity to develop theirindividual capacilies in a safe and enabling environment.

l8 per cent VAT rate was increased to 20 per cent. Theexistence of multiple rates, however, could lead to

complications in the VAT system. Meanwhile, to provide relief

to the public, the government granted VAT exemptions on a

number of consumer items and fertiliser. Concessions were also

-qranted on the payment of VAT on donations/purchases of

goods and services by organisations or persons en-eaged in

rehabilitation work in tsunami affected areas.l Excise taxes were increased in line with the

recommendation of the Presidential Taskforce on Alcohol,

Tobacco and Illicit Drugs. The taskforce recommended that

taxation on alcohol and tobacco should be increased annually

to reduce alcohol and tobacco consumption. Such reduction in

consumption is expected to have a positive impact on health and

labour productivity.p Revenue from import duties was expected to increase with

the rationalisation of import duties. The import duty structure

was reformed by the reduction in the number of tariff bands

from 6 to 5. The PAL on imports for processing and exports was

reduced to 0.25 per cent in 2005 from 0.50 per cent. Further, a

cess was imposed on a number of imported items, such as

maize, chocolate and cereal products. The other main tax

measure was the increase in the Betting and Gaming Levy to

discourage betting and gaming activities.r Measures to increase non tax revenue were also

implemented. Administrative fees and charges were raised on

a number of services provided by the government including

charges for using official vehicles for private use and rents on

properties. Fines and penalties were increased to reinforce the

government's commitment to make law enforcement more

effective.

E Several measures were taken to rationalise recurrent

expenditure. Rationalisation was mainly attempted through the

better allocation of funds and improved cash management by

the Treasury. To reduce losses of oil companies and thereby

reduce the subsidy cost on petroleum products due to escalatingoil prices, the government adjusted the domestic petroleum

prices on two occasions in 2005. However, these revisions were

inadequate to recover the total cost and therefore led to an

increase in subsidies on petroleum products. To reduce interest

cost, high cost Rupee loans with call options were retired and

low cost debt instruments were issued, The deferment of a partof the dues of foreign interest payments under the debt

moratorium granted for 2005 by foreign donors, helped contain

interest cost.o The government increased the salaries of the public sector

employees and pensions of the retirees in 2005. It is expected

that this would motivate the public sector and thereby bring in

many benetits in excess of the cost that will be reflected in the

budget. The conection of prevailing anomalies in the public

service salary structure was also envisaged through this salary

increase. This increase, however', will lead to a further increase

in the already high salary bill of the public sector. The provision

of relief to pensioners was the aim of the increase in pensions.r The government recruited 421588 unemployed graduates

who completed their formal training at ministries to

government service as a measure to alleviate the chronic

graduate unemployment problem. For this programme to be

successful and generate a positive outcome to the economy,

these graduates need to be employed gainfully in public

institutions.l The fertiliser subsidy was increased to support agricultural

development. The objective of this move was to keep domesticfertiliser prices unchanged in an environment where

international prices of chemical fertiliser were increasing in line

with the increase in crude oil prices. This upward revision of

the fertiliser subsidy will increase the expenditure on transfers

of the government.r Debt management policy was directed towards phasing out

borrowings through non-marketable debt instruments andresorting more to borrowings from Foreign Currency

Banking Units (FCBUs) of commercial banks. Accordingly,

the government continued its policy of retiring Rupee securities

in addition to replacing the high cost Rupee securities with low

cost instruments. Bonowings from FCBUs were increased to

reduce pressure on interest rates in the domestic rupee market.r Sri Lanka obtained debut sovereign ratings from two

international rating agencies in 2ffi5. Fitch Ratings assigned

the country rating of BB- (BB minus) while Standard & Poor's

(S&P) rated Sri Lanka at B+ (B plus). Sovereign ratings like

this will facilitate both the government and the private sector

to mobilise financial resources in international market.r Public investment was directed towards supporting the pro-

poor, pro-growth development strategy of the government.

Emphasis was placed on developing infrastructure facilities;

both large scale and rural infrastructure projects, while giving

due attention to both tsunami related reconstruction andrehabilitation of conflict affected areas. The National

Procurement Agency (NPA), which was set up in 2004,

continued its operations to facilitate and assist the government

in developing and implementing an efficient and transparent

public procurement system.c Measures to strengthen strategic public enterprises were

continued in 2005. The role of the private sector in pursuing

economic growth facilitated by the public sector and the

importance of continuing state ownership of strategically

important enterprises have been recognised by the government.

Sovereign credit ratin_{ is a forward-looking assessment and

a fbrmal evaluation of a soverei_qn _qoveiltment's capacity andwillingness to service its external debt obligations in full andon time. Major factors of determining the credit ratin_e in acountry are political risk, income and economic structure,economic _erowth prospects, debt burden, off-shorecontingent liabilities, external reserves, fiscal flexibility andmonetary stability. Obtaining a rating is a strong signal oftransparency of a country's policies. Having a universally

strategic enterprises under its purview and sought to improve

their management and ensure their commercial viability.

During the year, the strategic enterprises coming under the

SEMA prepared their action plans. Appropriate restructuring

initiatives for the future development of these enterprises were

agreed upon. The role of the Public Enterprises Reform

Commission (PERC), which is engaged in reforming other

public enterprises, was also reoriented to be consistent with this

policy strategy.o In 2005, the Fiscal Management Reform Programme(FMRP) was in progress with assistance from the Asian

Development Bank (ADB). This programlne commenced itsactions to strengthen public finances by improving

effectiveness of tax administration, improving expenditure

management, strengthening fiscal discipline and improving

fiscal coordination.e As enunciated in the MTFS of the government, fiscal policyin the medium term will be directed at continuing fiscal

consolidation while supporting economic development

objectives. Fiscal consolidation is expected to strengthen with

the increase in revenue and the rationalising of recurrent

expenditure while ensuring public investment in areas critical

for supporting economic growth. This process needs to be

complemented by eliminating inflationary financing and

rehabilitating infrastructure in conflict affected areas whileimproving the utilisation of foreign resources. As the

importance of these factors have already been recognized by the

govemment and planned to address them in its medium term

programmes, their effective implementation is crucial in

achieving medium term objectives.

GDP compared to 15.4 per cent in2004, reversing the

steady decline in revenue/GDP ratio observed since 1999.

This improvement was a result of the increase in both tax and

non-tax revenue collection. The increase in the tax revenue/

GDP ratio, which was started in 2004, continued in 2005. The

non-tax revenue/GDP ratio also increased when compared to

2004.

Tax revenue increased by 19.6 per cent to Rs.336.8 billion

and reached l4.2per cent of GDP in 2005 from 13.9 per centin the previous year. As a per cent of GDP, revenue fromincome taxes increased with the lower withholding tax

collection from -eovernment securities being offset by the

increase in revenue from taxes on the corporate sector, which

responded favourably to reforms. The revenue from VAT

remained unchanged as the increase in VAT collection,particularly through improvements in the VAT refund

mechanism, offset the drop in revenue arising from the VAT

exemptions on several essential food items, diesel and LP gas.

Total revenue from excise taxes increased compared to 2004,

as a result of the upward revision of excise taxes and the

increase in sales of liquor and cigarettes. The initial slowdownin import duty collection during the first several months of

2005, mainly due to the duty exemption on tsunami related

imports, and a decrease in motor vehicle imports in the first

quarter of the year due to the higher excise duties, caused a

marginal decline in the revenue from import duties as a per cent

of GDP.

Non-tax revenue increased by 43.4 per cent to Rs. 42.9

billion in 2005. As a per cent of GDP it increased to 1.8 per cent

Part IChapter 6 - FISCAL POLICY AND GOVERNMENT FINANCE

Investments generate streams of luture benefits. There aretwo major reasons for the -qovernment involvement ininvestment. First, the government has to make investmentsin producing public goods, which the private sector has noincentive to produce, or the capital outlay is too large, but isessential for economic growth. Second, public investment is

necessary to supply seivices needed forcreating aconducive

environment. for private investments.Public investment is often seen in the areas of physicalinfrastructure, human capital formation, and research and ,

developmenL. Improved physical infrastructure such as roads,

power, transportation, telecommunications and other facilities,enable the expansion in private investment and lower theprivate sectorcost ofproducing goods and services. Improvedhuman capital, particularly education and training, increasesthe availability of skilled workers and improves labourproductivity. Research and development lead to innovativeproducts and production processes that lower the costs:Successive governments in Sri Lanka have beenpromoting public investment, but the magnitude has not beensufficient to promote economic growth. Ttre level of publicinvestment peaked in mid 1980s reaching 14-15 per cent ofGDP especially with the implementation of acCeleratedMahaweli development project (Table B13.1). The majorportion of the public investment was in the economic selicessector'fo1lowedby5ocialservicesandgeneralpub|icservices. Public investment has since declined graduallyreaching a level of 4.8 per cent of GDP in 2004. It increasedto 6.3 pef cent of GDP in 2005 with tsunami expenditure.Budgetary constraints emanatin-q from the increaseddefence eipenditure, debt service payments and curuent

transferC necessitated the govemment to prioritise and curtailpublic investment. fu a result, public investment in economicinfrastructure has not been sufficient to maintain the existinginfrastrucLure and to improve their capacity; service quality

and reliability during the last few years. Consequence isparticularly reflected by the under developed nature andunsatisfactory quality of infrastructure facilities.

The publ ic i nve stment i s mainl y fi nanced through fore i gn

assistance by way of concessional loans and grants (60-70 percent), Problems in releasing the domestic counterpart funds

have aft-ected the eff-ective implementatioh of foreign fundedprojects. In addition, the utilisation of available foreignfinancing for investment projects has not been at acceptablelevel due to problems in procurement procedures,administrative barriers, inadequate coordination andimplementation, weaknesses in prqect monitori ng, del ays and

issues in getting reimbursement of fbrei-en funds, problems inacquiring land, and excessive environmental concerns.To overcome the implementation bottlenecks in publicinvestment, the government has established the NationalProcurement Agency (NPA) in 2004, Through NPA, the

Box 13

government expects to oversee proculement monitoring,capacity building and resolving policy related matters andstrengthen and streamline the government procurementsystem. The mandate of the NPA also includes preventingdelays and inefficiencies through the formulation ofsimplifi ed and harmonised procurement policies, guidelinesand standards. To ensure the expected progress, otherbottlenecks related to project implementation are also beingaddressed by the government on priority basis.The government has planned to increase the publicinvestment to abour 6.6 per cent of GDP in 2006 withouttsunami expenditure (8 '3 per cent of GDP with tsunamiexpenditure of 1.7 per cent) and to 7,7 per cent of GDP (withtsunami expenditure) by 2008. This will complement theprivate sector investment in realising the total investmenttarget of 30 per cent of GDP in 2008 and achieving 6-8 per

cent growth in the medium term. To support this investmenteffofi further, the government also expeCts to promote public-private partnerships (PPP) to implement large-scaleinfrastructure development proj ects.

Public Investment in Sri Lanka: Developments, Issues and Prospects

The eftective implementation of the proposed publicinvestment programme depends on many factors. Removingthe:botflenecks mentioned above is critical in achieving theset targets. In addition, commitment of the stakeholders,generating a surplus in the government current account,c support, mplea rms and publa in this Theimplementation of the programme will lead accelerating theeconomic growth, creating an enabling environment forprivate investments, and creating em t opportuhitiestherebyhelping reduce the regional di and poverty ona more sustainable basis. However, any drawback wouldlower the expected benefits, requiring vcry high level ofinvestments in the future.

expenditure increased to Rs.443.4 billion (18.7 per cent of

GDP) from Rs.389.7 billion (l9.2per cent of GDP) in2004.Capital expenditure and net lending increased to Rs.I4l.4billion (6.0 per cent of GDP) from Rs.87.2 billion (4.3 per centof GDP) in the previous year. Of the total expenditure, the

tsunami expenditure was Rs.34 billion (1.4 per cent of GDP).

In current expenditure, the salary bill and transfers to

households increased considerably in 2005. The salary bill,which accounts for about a third of current expenditure

increased by 30.5 per cent to Rs.138.6 billion due to salary

increases granted in 2005 and the increased recruitments to the

government service. Transfers to households increased largely

due to the higher subsidy on petroleum products (Rs. 26 billion)

as a result of the inadequate adjustment of domestic petroleum

prices, hi-eher pension payments and higher expenditure on the

fertiliser subsidy. Transfers to public institutions also increased

as a result of salary increases coupled with their various

inefficiencies. Total defence expenditure amounted to Rs.82billion (3.5 per cent of GDP), compared to Rs.73.4 billion (3.6

per cent of GDP) in the previous year. The interest payments

remained almost unchanged compared to the previous year

owing to the debt moratorium granted by foreign donors in

2005.

Public investment increased in 2005. This was due to efforts

made by the -qovernment to fast track the implementation of

development projects as well as tsunami related capital

expenditure. As a per cent of GDP, public investment increased

to 6.3 per cent from 4.8 per cent in 2004, includin-e tsunami

related investments of I per cent.

Investment in the economic services (3.3 per cent of GDP)

continued to dominate public investment accountingfor 52per cent of the total public investment in 2005. Within the

economic services sector, transport and communication, and

energy and water supply were the main areas, which absorbed

34 per cent of the total public investments in 2005.

t Public investment in social services showed an increase to

1.5 per cent of GDP. The share of education and health sub

sectors increased in 2005. The investments in the education and

health sectors were mainly for construction of schools and

hospitals and their quality improvements. The investment incommunity services was to finance various community

development and empowerment programmes.

Financing the Budget Deficit

The overall budget deficit of the government in 2005amounted to 8.7 per cent of GDP, compared with therevised deficit target of 8.2 per cent of GDP. The budget

deficit excluding tsunami expenditure was 7.3 per cent of GDP.

The current account deficit, which minors the savings positionof the govemment declined to 2.7 per cent from 3.9 per cent in

2004 while the primary deficit, which reflects the outcome of

the current year's fiscal operations increased to 3.6 per centfrom2.2 per cent in the previous year.

The overall budget deficit of Rs.205.0 billion was financedthrough net domestic borrowings (Rs.123.6 billion), netforeign borrowingp (Rs.47.8 billion), foreign grants (Rs.32.6billion) and privatisation proceeds (Rs.1.0 billion). As a per

cent of GDP, total net domestic financing decreased to 5.2 per

cent from 5.8 per cent in 2004 while net foreign financing (loans

and grants) increased to 3.4 per cent fromZ.2 per cent in the

prevrous year.

The debt dependency ratio (the ratio of total net borrowings

to total government expenditure) declined to 29.3 per centin 2005 from 32.3 per cent in 2004. The relatively lower

recourse to debt to finance the deficit was due to the tsunami

related foreign grants. Dependence on foreign assistance, i.e.,

loans and grants, for budgetary financing increased to 39.2 per

cent of the total deficit in 2005 from 27.7 per cent in the

previous year. This too was mainly due to inflows of tsunami

related foreign grants and debt moratorium.

Government borrowings from the banking system declined

to Rs.26.2 billion (1.1 per cent of GDP) from Rs.43.2 billion

(2.1 per cent of GDP) in2004.ln 2005, the government

borrowed Rs.59.9 billion from commercial banks and repaid

Rs.33.7 billion to the Central Bank.

Net borrowings from the domestic non-bank sector

increased to Rs. 97.4 billion (4.1 per cent of GDP) fromRs.74.0 billion (3.5 per cent of GDP) in 2004. TheEmployees' Provident Fund (42.2 per cent) and National

Savings Bank (18.4 per cent ) continued to be the major sources

of non-bank f,rnancing.

Net domestic borrowings through debt instruments

declined to Rs.74.5 billion in 2005 from Rs. 9E billion in

20M. The entire amount of net domestic borrowings throu-eh

debt instruments was made through Treasury bonds (Rs.108

billion), as there were net repayments of Treasury bills (Rs.9.4billion) and Rupee loans (Rs.24.2 billion).

The maturity structure of instrument based borrowings

skewed towards the shorter end of the market. This reflected

investor preference for short-term commitment of funds in an

environment of rising interest rates. For the first time, to

securitise a part of the outstanding overdrafts, the government

issued Index-linked Treasurv bonds of Rs.22 billion to the two

state banks in 2005,

Total non debt instrument borrowings in 2005 amounted to

Rs. 49.1 billion. There were borrowings from FCBUs of state

owned commercial banks amounting to Rs. 41.7 billion (US

dollars 415 million). In 2005, total non-debt instrument

borrowings increased to 39.7 per cent of the total net domestic

bonowings from 16.4 per cent in2004.

The disbursement of foreign loans, on a gross basis,

amounted to Rs.75.2 billion in 2005 compared to Rs.78.3billion in 2004. A major parl of the foreign loans was received

by way of project loans that amounted to Rs. 62.7 billion while

receipts of pro-eramme loans amounted to Rs.2 billion.In 2004,

gross disbursements of loans throu-eh project and programmeloans amounted to Rs.68.3 billion and Rs.3.0 billion,

respectively. Japan, the ADB, and International Development

Association (tDA) were the major donors of project loans. The

balance consisted of commercial loans amounting to Rs.l0.5billion including the syndicated forei-en commercial loan ofRs.l0.2 billion (US dollars 100 million) obtained by the

government in December 2005.a Net foreign borrowings increased to Rs.47.8 billion (2.0 per

cent of GDP) compared to Rs.37 billion (1.8 per cent of

GDP) in 2004. This was entirely due to the lower amortisation

payments of Rs.21.4 billion. The amortisation payments on

outstanding foreign loans declined by about a half as a result of

the deferment of a part of the amortisation payments (Rs.18.4

billion) due to the debt moratorium granted by foreign donors

in 2005.s Foreign grants received by the government increased to

Rs.32.6 billion (1.4 per cent of GDP) from Rs. 8.7 billion (0.4

per cent of GDP) in 2004. This increase was largely due to

tsunami related inflows. Bilateral donors such as Japan and theUSA and multilateral donors such as the ADB. the UnitedNations Children's Fund (UNICEF), United NationsDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and the Food andAgricultural Organisation (FAO) were the major donors of

foreign grants.

6.4 Sub National Government BudgetaryOperationso Sri Lanka's sub national government (SNG) system consists

of Provincial Councils (PCs) and Local Governments (LGs).

The PCs, (8 PCs at present) have been established under the 13h

Amendment to the Constitution to decentralise the decision

making process by the devolution of powers to sub-national

level governments. The LG system as at end 2005 comprised

of 3ll units, consisting l8 Municipal Councils (MCs), 37

Urban Councils (UCs) and256 Pradesheeya Sabhas (PSs).s SNGs rely heavily on central government transfers for their

operations as their scope for collecting revenues is limited

and the resource mobilising powers granted to them are

inadequate. Thus, the government provides various types of

grants to finance the resource gap. This has led to the SNGs

continuing to exist without making strong efforts to collect the

revenues.o The SNG system played an important role in the tsunami

recovery process. The impact of the tsunami included damages

causedtopropertiesof 7MCs, 14UCs and49 PSs. Thedamage

was estimated to be Rs.2.8 billion. The Ministry of Provincial

Councils and Local Governments (MPCLG) was involved inrehabilitation and reconstruction in the affected LGs, the

reinstallation of LG management and information systems

including the retrieval of damaged legal and other documents.. SNGs faced a number of problems in rendering their

services. The limited devolution of power to mobilise required

resources, the weak institutional framework, inadequatefinancial and human resource management and the lack of

technical skills were among the key problems. In 2005, the

MPCLG established a Monitoring Unit to monitor the progress

of PCs.t The MPCLG expects to intervene in several areas relatedto SNGs in the future. The key areas include providing

budgetary funds to ensure financial stability of the SNGs,improving their administrative capacity and capabilities,

increasing investment at SNG level for the development of

provincial and rural roads, the development of Northern and

Eastern provinces, and the rehabilitation and reconstruction of

infrastructure and services destroyed by the tsunami.

Performance of Provincial Councilsc The overall budgetary performance of PCs in 2005 did notreflect a significant improvement compared to 2004.

Revenue collection remained at 0.7 per cent of GDP as in the

previous year. Total expenditure increased to 3.1 per cent of

GDP from 2.8 per cent in 2004.l The increase (19 per cent) in revenue from turnover taxes

and licence fees mainly contributed to the higher nominal

increase in revenue of PCs. About 58 per cent of the total

revenue was collected from these two sources. As a result of the

high concentration of industnal and commercial activities and

a large population, the Western Provincial Council (WPC)

accounted for 68 per cent of the total revenue collection. The

other major revenue collectin,q PCs were those of the Central,

Southern and North Western Provinces.

Recurrent expenditure of PCs increased to 2.5 per cent of

GDP in 2005 from 2.3 per cent in 2004. This was mainly due

to the increase in public sector salaries and wages. The major

portion of the personal emoluments (90 per cent) of PCs was

absorbed by education (67 per cent) and health (23 per cent)

sectors. The balance was used for other non-wage expenses in

relation to goods and services.

Investment expenditure of PCs increased to 0.6 per cent of

GDP in 2005 from 0.5 per cent in 2004. Their investmentexpenditure was mainly in respect of Province Specific

Development Projects (PSDP) and foreign funded special

projects.

Transfers from the central government to PCs amounted to

Rs.54 billion in 2005. These transfers were in the form ofblock grants, matching grants, criteria based grants and

Province Specific Development Grants (PSDG). Foreign grants

for special projects amounted to Rs.6 billion.

Performance of Local Governmentsr In 2005, LGs continued their operations in the midst of anumber of constraints that affected their effectivefunctioning. The devolved revenue and transfers from the

central government were the major sources of finance for their

operations. PCs worked as the agent for LGs in collecting someof the devolved revenues such as property transfer taxes and

court fines as assigned under the l3'h Amendment to the

Constitution. Personal emoluments, other cunent expenses and

capital expenses comprised the outlays of LGs. The weakfinancial systems and human resource management,

weaknesses in regulation and monitoring, lack of competent

technical staff, non-availability of proper record keeping

systems, lower revenue collection and lack of legal powers

continued to be the major constraints for the effective

functioning of LGs.

6.5 Financial Performance of SelectedPublic Enterprises

The two public enterprises, which have a significant impacton the government budget at present, are the Ceylon

Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and the Ceylon Electricity

The financial position of the CPC improved in 2005. Thecontributory factors are the progress made in financial

management, internal controls, external financial support,

importing refined products on a more competitive basis,

ne-eotiatin-{ more favourable terms on suppliers credit, receipt

of an extended suppliers credit facility fiom Iran and a long-

term credit facility under the Indian Line of Credit, and the fuel

subsidy received from the government. The credit facilities

obtained from Iran and India helped improve the liquidity

position of the CPC and reduce short-term advances taken from

commercialbanks. Thou-eh the credit facility obtained under theIndian Line of Credit shifted a part of the CPC's short term

liabilities to medium to long term liabilities, overall outstandin-q

high debt still remains a concem. Non-adjustment of domesticprices adequately and in time accordin-e to the formulaintroduced in January 2002 was the major reason for

accumulation of debt. The sharp rises in international prices

have led to a higher subsidy from the government.

The financial position of CEB continued to weaken. Delaysin implementing new low cost power plants, nonimplementation of proposed reforms, non adjustment of

electricity prices to reflect the cost and the delay in addressin-q

the high system losses were the main contributory factors for

the weakening financial position of the CEB.

The total amount of subsidies for petroleum productsamounted to Rs. 26 billion in 2005 (1.1 per cent of GDP).

This underscores the unsustainability of continuing the policyof providing subsidies on untar-qetted basis. A strong

commitment to the implementation of the necessary measuresto reduce the burden on the government budget is urgently

needed.

40.4 per cent. The corresponding ratios in the previous year

were 56.4 per cent and 49.1 per cent, respectively.In nominal terms, total outstanding debt increased byRs.82.8 billion in 2005. This increase was the result of the

increase in domestic debt by Rs12L3 billion and a decline inforeign debt by Rs.39.5 billion. The decline in the foreign debt

stock was entirely due to the appreciation of the rupee vis-)-vis

major forei-en cunencies. The total impact of the exchan_qe ratevariation in 2005 was a decline of the foreign debt stock bv

Rs.100.7 billion.

outstanding domestic debt portfolio and its share in the total

domestic debt increased to 59.4 per cent from 56.3 per cent inthe previous year. As the retirement of Rupee loans was

continued, their share in the total outstanding domestic debt

stock declined to I I.I per cent. This share was 24.4per cent and

14.4per cent in 2003 and z0}4,respectively. Of the short-term

debt stock (20.7 per cent of the total domestic debt), Treasurybills accounted for 89 per cent.

The outstanding debt liabilities to commercial banksincreased by 9.3 per cent in 2005. It accounted for 23.6 per

cent of the total domestic debt stock. Of the total liability tocommercial banks, the outstanding foreign currency

denominated domestic debt increased to US dollars 965 million

(Rs.98.5 billion) from US dollars 550 million (Rs.57.5 billion)

in 2004. This consisted of bonowings from FCBUs amountingto US dollars 715 million and outstanding Sri Lanka

Development Bonds (SLDBs) of US dollars 250 million. Thegrowth in foreign currency denominated domestic debt hasincreased the vulnerability of the domestic debt stock to

exchange rate variations.

The share of outstanding concessional loans in the totalforeign debt stock declined to 96.0 per cent from 97.4 per

cent in 2004. This was due to increased foreign commercialborrowings. The non concessional debt consisted mostly of

foreign commercial debt (96.9 per cent), that increased by 55.3

per cent to Rs. 36.4 billion in 2005. The shares of bilateral and

multilateral debt accounted for 45.3 per cent and 50.9 per cent,

respectively. Japan continued to be the major bilateral donor,

accounting for 29.0 per cent of the total foreign debt stock,

followed by the USA (5.8 per cent) and Germany (5.1 per cent).

The main multilateral donors were the ADB (24.0 per cent) andIDA (22.4 per cent).t The government debt as a per cent of GDP still remainshigh, though it declined somewhat in 2005. This situationposes several threats including high interest paymentcommitments, which will increase the pressure on the

government's ability to meet its other commitments and leavelittle room for other essential expenditure and development-

oriented investment. This could also have adverse implications

on monetary mana-qement and could reduce the country'sability to withstand external shocks. Thus, there is a need for

strong measures to strengthen the fiscal consolidation process

and move towards achievine fiscal sustainabilitv in the medium

to long term.

Non Financial Public Corporation Debts The outstanding liabilities of non financial publiccorporations (NFPC) to the banking system and theirforeign long-term liabilities amounted to Rs.3l.4 billioncompared to Rs.4l.2 billion in2004. The debt liabilities of

NFPCs to the banking system declined by Rs.24.5 billion toRs.t6.7 billion in 2005. The main NFPCs that recorded

decreased liabilities to the banking sector were the CPC (Rs. 6.8billion) and the CEB (2.7 billion). These two institutions

accounted for 68 per cent of the total outstanding NFPC debt

to the bankin-q system. The outstanding lon-e term liabilities ofthe NFPCs amounted to Rs.l4.7 billion (US dollars 144million) which included the credit line obtained by the CPCfrom India.

Public Sector DebtI The outstanding debt stock of the public sector, which

includes the government and NFPCs, increased by 3.4 percent to Rs.2,253.7 billion as at the end of 2005. It was

Rs.2,180.7 billion at the end of 2004. However, the public

sector debt as a per cent of GDP, declined to 95.3 per cent from

107.5 per cent at the end of the previous year. CPC and CEB

continued to be the major debtors among the NFPCs.

Debt Service Paymentss The total domestic and foreign debt service payments,which consist of interest and amortisation payments,

increased to Rs. 3U.9 billion in 2005. Of the total, interest

payments amounted to Rs.120.2 billion (35 per cent) and

amortisation payments amounted toRs.224.7 billion (65 per

cent). Debt service payments to domestic and foreign sources

amounted to Rs.316.5 billion and Rs.28.4 billion, respectively.& The debt moratorium granted by foreign donors resulted inthe deferment of debt service payments of Rs.26.3 billion(US dollars 258.6 million) in 2005. This comprised Rs.8.0billion in interest payments and Rs.l8.3 billion in amortisation

payments. Japan was the main creditor, accounting for 7I per

cent of the total defened debt service payments, followed by the

USA and Germany accounting for l3.2per cent and 6 per cent,

respectively of the total amount defened. The defened debt

service payments would have to be paid within a period of four

years (8 equal semi annual instalments). Repayments will

commence from December2006, after the grace period of about

a year. Further, the debt written-off by creditors in 2005

amounted to Rs.0.8 billion (US dollars 8.2 million). Italy, China
