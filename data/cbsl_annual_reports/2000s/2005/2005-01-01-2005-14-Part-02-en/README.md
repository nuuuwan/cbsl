(d) International Monetary Fund (IMF) Related

Balances

The Bank transacts with the International Monetary Fund (lMF)

in its own right rather than as an agent for the Government of

SriLanka. All transactions by the Bank with the IMF have been

included in these financial statements on that basis.

Quota with the IMF is recorded by the Bank as an asset and

the amount payable to the IMF for quota is recorded as a liability

of the Bank. The cumulative allocation of SDRs by the IMF is

treated as a liability. Exchange gains and losses arising on

revaluation of IMF assets and liabilities at the exchan-ee rate

applyin-e at balance sheet date as published by the IMF are

recognised in the Income Statement.All other charges and interest penaining with balances with

the IMF are recorded immediately in the Income Statement.

(e) Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at foreign banks and

financial institutions and short-term deposits.As a part of local currency activities CBSL generates

certain income and incurs expenses, which do not involve in

movement of cash. Those activities result in certain assets and

Iiabilities and mainly comprise the transactions with GOSL and

transactions with domestic banks and financial institutions.Transactions with the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL)

basically represents the purchase of un-subscribed portions of

Treasury bills and bonds that are issued by the Government by

the Bank as a monetary policy mechanism . Such purchases,

disposals or interest thereon are reflected as mere book entriesin the records of CBSL. These are disclosed separately in Note

20 and Note 2l to these Financial Statements.

As the sole statutory authority, CBSL issues cunency to thepublic in line with the Monetary Law Act. Cunency issued byCBSL represents a claim on the bank in favour of the holder.

This is a liability on the part of the CBSL while it is an item of

cash in the hands of the holder. Movement in circulation

currency is included as part of financing activities in line withprevailing industry practice among those central banks which

present cash flow statements.

CBSL through the cash/pay order process disburses cash in

the form of Notes and Coins or cheques drawn on CBSL, to

various drawees including suppliers and employees for goods

and services obtained, which is either added to the cunency incirculation liability or Balances with Commercial Banks. Suchforms of utilisation of currency for the purposes of CBSL's

payments form part of cash outflows of CBSL.

For the purposes of the Cash Flow Statement, cash and cashequivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined

above, net of caslVpayorder outflows.(f) Repurchase and Reverse-Repurchase Transactions

Securities sold under a-qreements to repurchase continue to be

recorded as assets in the Balance Sheet. The obligation to

repurchase (Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase)

is disclosed as a liability. The difference between the sale and

repurchase price in repurchase transactions and the purchase

pnce and sale price in reverse-repurchase transactions represents

an expense and income respectively and recognised in the

Income Statement.

Securities held under reverse-repurchase agreements are

recorded as an asset in the Balance Sheet (Secunties Purchased

Under A-ereements to Re-sell). Both repurchase and reverse-

repurchase transactions are reported at the transaction value

inclusive of any accrued income or expense.(9 Investment Portfolio - Sri Lanka GovernmentSecurities

The Bank's investment portfolio consists of treasury bills and

bonds purchased from Government of Sri Lanka. The portfoliois recorded in the Balance Sheet at amortised cost since they

represent loans provided to the GOSL.

(h) Loans to Government

Loans to Government represents direct provisional advances

made to Government of Sri Lanka under Section 89 of the

Monetary Law Act No 58 of 1949 of Sri Lanka, as amended.(i) Loans to Other Institutions

Loans granted to Other Institutions are recognised and camedat the original granted amount less an allowance for any

uncollectible amounts. An allowance for doubtful debts (for loan

impairment) is established if there is objective evidence that the

Bank will not be able to collect all amounts due. The amount of

the allowance is the difference between the carrying amount and

the estimated recoverable amount. Bad debts are written off

when identified.

C) Foreign Currency Term Liabilities

Foreign currency term Iiabilities are subsequently reported at the

amortised cost of the liabilities. Changes in the value of these

liabilities are recognised as an increase or decrease in the valueof the term liabilities in the Balance Sheet. Gains and losses

arising from changes in value of foreign currency term liabilitiesare recognised immediately as expenses in the Income

Statement. Where the liability is still owed, the gain or loss is

reported as (Gain) Loss from Unrealised Price Revaluation.

Where the gain or loss has been realised (through repayment of

the liability), this is reported as (Gains) Losses Realised from

Price Changes.(k) Derivative Instruments

The Bank's involvement in derivative instruments is mainly in

forward forei-en exchange contracts. Such derivative hnancial

instruments are stated at fair value. The fair value of forward

exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward

exchan-{e rates for contracts with similal maturity profiles.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2005(IX)

Part llAccounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

All denvative instruments in a -eain or loss position, if any,

are reported within the balance of foreign currency tradin-e or

availabie for sale securities in the Balance Sheet.(l) Other Financial Assets and Liabilities

Local and foreign currency cash, deposits and short-term

advances are recognised on trade date.

(m) Impairment of Financial Assets

The Bank assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial

asset is impaired for.

(i) Assets carried at amortised cost

If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans

and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incuned, the

amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the

asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future

cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been

incurred) discounted at the financial asset's onginal effective

interest rate (ie the effective interest rate computed at initial

recognition). The canying amount of the asset shallbe reducedeither directly or through use of an allowance account. The

amount of the loss shall be recognised in the income statement.The Bank first assesses whether objective evidence ofimpairment exists individually for financial assets that areindividually significant, and individually or collectively forfinancial assets that are not individually significant. If it is

determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for

an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant ornot, the asset is included in a group of financial assets withsimilar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial

assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that areindividually assessed for impairment and for which an

impairment loss is or continues to be recognised are not included

in a collective assessment of impairment,Il in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment

loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to anevent occurring after the impairment was recognised, thepreviously recognised impairment loss is reversed. Any

subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is reco-{nised in the

income statement, to the extent that the carrying value of the

asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.

(ii) Available-for-sale investments

If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising

the difference between its cost (net of any principal payment and

amortisation) and its cunent fair value, less any impairment loss

previously recognized in profit or loss, is transfened from equityto the income statement. Reversals in respect of equity

instruments classified as available-for-sale are not recognised inprofit. Reversals of impairment losses on debt instruments are

reversed throu-sh profit or loss, if the increase in fair value of the

instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after

the impairment loss was reco-qnised in profit or loss.

1.10 Investments in Associates

are held for subsequent disposals are accounted for under cost

method.

The carrying values of plant and equipment are reviewedfor impairment when events or changes in circumstancesindicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.Following jnitial recognition at cost, land and buildin-es are

carried at a revalued amount, which is the fair value at the date

of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation

on buildings and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.Valuations are performed frequently enough to ensure that

the fair value of a revalued asset does not differ materiallv from

rts carrylng amount.Any revaluation surplus is credited to the Revaluation

Reserve included in the equity section of the Balance Sheet,

except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the

same asset previously reco,Enised in Income Statement, in which

case the increase is recognised in Income Statement. A

revaluation deficit is recognised in Income Statement, except

that a deficit directly offsetting a previous surplus on the same

asset is directly offset a-eainst the surplus in the Revaluation

particular asset bein-e sold is transferred to retained earnings, An

item of Property, Plant and Equipment is dereco-{nised upon

2. Bank Supervision

The regulatory and supervisory function of the Central Bankrelating to banks licensed by the Monetary Board of the CentralBank is carried out by the Bank Supervision Department (BSD),

with a view to ensurin-e the safety and soundness of the banking

system and safeguarding the interests of depositors and othercreditors. As at end of 2005, 36 licensed banks, r.e.,22licensedcommercial banks (LCB) and 14 licensed specialized banks(LSB), were in operation under the regulation and supervisionof the Central Bank. The operations of the BSD in 2005 mainlyincluded the following:-

2.L Issue of Prudential Regulations

The BSD issued several new prudential regulations andguidelines as well as amendments to existing prudential

requirements to the licensed banks in 2005, Details of theseregulations and -euidelines are at part III of this report. The new

requirements were with regard to the bank authorization process,facilitation of Islamic banking, capital strengthening, corporate

governance, risk mitigation and market disclosure, as follows:-(a) Bank directors to submit an affidavit and declaration thatthey are fit and proper persons to hold such positions interms of Section 42 of the Banking Act (Amendment) in2005.O) Permitting banks to offer banking products based onIslamic principles subject to compliance with existingprudential requirements.(c) Minimum equity capital requirement. The minimumcapital was raised from Rs.500 million to Rs.2,500 millionfor LCBs and from Rs.200 million to Rs.1.500 million forLSBs excluding RegionalDevelopment Banks with a viewto encouraging the consolidation of the banking sectorwith the presence of strong banks. Existing banks weregiven the time till December 2007 to meet the increasedcapital, provided that 50 per cent of the shortfall of capitalis met by end of 2006.(d) Accommodation to related parties. The maximum limit ofaccommodation granted by a bank to a director or a closerelation of a director was determined as Rs.500,000 against

the approved securities and Rs.500,000 in respect of creditcards without requiring securities.(e) Single Bonower Limit (SBL), Regulation on SBL wasrevised to ensure uniformity among all banks byprescnbing the SBL at 30 per cent of capital and to exemptfrom the SBL (a) facilities secured by a guarantee issuedby "A" rated international and local banks or by an

undertakin-e/guarantee issued by the Head Office in case

of foreign banks and (b) facilities granted to infrastructure

development projects provided that such project is funded

at least 50 per cent by sources outside Sri Lanka or by aconsortium of LCBs and./or LSBs excludine the bank

grantin,q the accommodation.(0 Disclosure of financial statements. With a view toenhancing market discipline and risk assessment,the prescribed format for publication of quarterlyfinancial statements of banks in the press was revised toinclude sele cted key performance indicatorssuch as non-performing loans, capital adequacy,liquidity, interest margin, operational expenses andprofitability.

In addition, the BSD introduced to the banking industry, a

road map for the implementation of the Basel II Capital Accordthrough the Standardized Approach in2007108. Banks were

requested to make a self-assessment for implementation of BaselII. A Committee consisting of representatives from banks and

the BSD was set up to resolve implementation issues that may

arise. The framework for implementation of the capital chargefor market risk with effect from March 2006. was finalized andawaited the views of the banking industry. The Central Bank

hosted two international seminars in Colombo on "Preparationof Implementation of Basel II in the Asia Pacific Region" and"10'h SEACEN-FSI Regional Seminar on Basel II and

Operational Risk".

2.2 Approvals for Banks, Branches andOther Banking Outlets

During the year 2005, the BSD continued to process requests for

banking licenses and for the opening, closing and relocation of

bank branches and otherbanking outlets in terms of the BankingAct. A license was issued to the SME Bank Ltd. to operate as

a LSB. License to operate as a LCB was issued to the National

Development Bank Ltd., which was incorporated by vesting the

operations of National Development Bank of Sri Lanka, a LSB,

and subsequently took over the business of NDB Bank Ltd, aLCB. The letter of provisional approval for ICICI Bank Ltd. in

India to commence operations as a LCB in Sri Lanka was issued.During the year, approvals were granted for 50 new branches,relocation of 85 branches, 93 other banking outlets such as

extension offices, pawning centers and student savings units, l7relocations and 6 up-grading of banking outlets, 38 off-siteAutomated Teller Machines (ATMs) and one relocation ofATM. Accordingly, there were 1,507 branches, 2,3L4 otherbanking outlets and 836 ATMs in operations as at the end of2005.

The supervisory function of the BSD has a two pronged

approach - The continuous monitoring of the health of the banksthrough off-site surveillance and the on-site examination of

banks within a defined statutory period.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2005( xIIr )

Part llAccounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

2.3 Off-Site Surveillance of LicensedBanks

This function entails an analysis of the financial condition ofLCBs and LSBs on the basis of penodic financial informationprovided by the banks to the BSD. An assessment of the risk

exposure of individual banks and of the bankin.e system as awhole is canied out. The off-site surveillance serves as an earlywaming system in identifying significant and critical chan-ees inthe financial condition of banks which require furtherinvestigation and examination. A new on-line web-based

reporting system is cunently being developed through a central

database in the Central Bank covering the banking industry and

registered finance companies. The new system was launched on

a test basis in 2005 and will be fully implemented in 2006,

2.4 Statutory On-site Examinations ofLicensed Banks

In terms of the provisions of the Monetary Law Act and theBanking Act, all LCBs and LSBs are subject to statutoryexaminations, at least once during each examination period asdetermined by the Monetary Board, which at present is twoyears. The BSD has adopted an on-site examination processwhich is risk-based and which focuses on identification ofbanking risks, the management of these risks and the assessmentof the adequacy of resources to mitigate the risks. In 2005, theBSD undenook22 statutory examinations which included l2

examinations that commenced in 2005 and the completion of 10examinations that commenced in 2004. The examinations of 8

banks out of l2 that commenced in 2005 were completed and 4examinations await completion. Accordingly, the BSDcompleted 18 examinations in 2005.

2.5 Resolution Action on Pramuka Savingsand Development Bank Ltd (PSDB)

Following the suspension of the business of PSDB in October2002, the Monetary Board, on 18d December,2002, decided

to cancel the banking license of the PSDB and to issue an orderin terms of the provisions of the Monetary Law Act to theDirector of Bank Supervision to take action to wind up thePSDB. However, in terms of subsequent judgments of the Courtof Appeal and the Supreme Court on cases filed by groups ofdepositors and the management of the PSDB, challenging thedecision of the Monetary Board, the Central Bank consideredfurther, the options to resume the business of the PSDB in termsof the law. In this regard, several parties expressed interest inrestructuring the PSDB with a view to resume business. TheCentral Bank evaluated proposals/concept papers with the

assistance of an independent consultant, i.e., Messrs Ernst and

Youn-{, and found that none of the proposals to recapitalise and

restructure PSDB to protcct the interest of depositors and othercreditors were feasible. Thereforc, the Monetary Board decided

on 3'd August, 2004 to suspend the business of the PSDB in

terms of Section 76M(l) of the Banking Act and to cause theDirector of Bank Supervision to make application to thecompetent court to wind up PSDB under Section 30(3) of theMonetary Law Act and to cancel the banking license of PSDBin terms of Section 30(lOXb) of the Monetary Law Act.Accordingly, the Director of Bank Supervision filed action

bearing no. 168/CO in the District Court of Colombo for thewinding-up of PSDB. Subsequently, a depositor of the PSDBfiled action bearing no. 195512004 in the Court of Appealseeking to quash the decision of the Monetary Board toliquidate the PSDB and to cancel its license. An interim orderwas issued by the Court of Appeal staying the winding upproceedings until the hearing and final determination of theCourt of Appeal application. The arguments for the case wereconcluded in June 2005 and the judgment is awaited. InDecember 2005, the Government expressed its intention torestructure PSDB in the interest of depositors and othercreditors and a Committee was appointed to make appropriaterecommendations to the Hon. Minister of State BankDevelopment on a feasible proposal. Accordingly, in January2006, the Government approved of a proposal for setting up

a new state bank which will take over the liabilities and goodassets of PSDB while the bad assets of PSDB will betransferred to an Asset Management Company proposed to beestablished for this purpose.

2.6 Financial Safety Net - Administrationof the Deposit Insurance Scheme

The BSD continued to administer the voluntary Deposit

Insurance Scheme, which commenced operations in 1987. This

scheme was opened to banking institutions licensed by the

Central Bank and co-operative societies registered under theCo-operative Societies Law No.5 of 1972, which accept

deposits. In 2005, only one Multi-Purpose Co-operative Societyhad obtained insurance cover under the scheme in respect of

deposit liabilities of its rural banks. The deposit insurance fund

consisting of the premium collected and Rs.50 million allocatedby the Central Bank in 1997 stood at Rs.l86 million as at 3lDecember 2005. These funds have been invested ingovernment securities with a face value of Rs.20l million. The

proposal for a mandatory deposit insurance scheme approvedin principle by the Monetary Board, to replace the existingvoluntary scheme was discussed at financial reform fora andits feasibility was examined. A team of consultants from theInternational Monetary Fund reviewed the feasibility of theproposal and recommended a two-track approach, i.e.,

developing the scheme while implementin-e policies to improvefinancial system stability to support the scheme. Accordin_qly,a decision was taken to propose necessary legislation toimplement the scheme.

issues are primarily through -(a) The monthly meetings of the Governor with Chief

Executive Officers of Banks: These meetings serye as aforum for exchange of views on issues and policiesrelating to banking operations and helps to establish arapport between the banks and the Central Bank. Someof the major issues discussed were the implementation of

the Susahana Refinance Credit Scheme to assist small andmedium enterprises affected by the Tsunami,

implementation of a capital charge for market risk in thecapital adequacy requirement, preparation for theimplementation of the Basel II Capital Accord,

banks.(b) Meetings of the two Committees on Financial SystemStability and Reforms(i) Financial Sector Cluster (FSCL): The FSCL has beenset up under the National Council for Economic

Development (NCED) appointed by the former H.E.The President in June 2004 under Article 33 of theConstitution. The NCED consists of six members

chaired by the Secretary to the Treasury. 24 Clustersunder the NCED have been appointed to assist theNCED in reviewing and identifying the necessaryreforms and to make appropriate recommendations.The other clusters of the NCED cover subjects suchas Taxation, Capital Market, Le-eal, Apparel,Telecommunication, Small and Medium Enterprises,Exports, Transport, Tourism and Trade and Tariffs.Each cluster is co-chaired and consists of expefts/

professionals in the respective fields as members. Theclusters are expected to look into the practicaldifficulties faced when implementin-Q governmentpolicies and take action to accelerate the projects/

pro,qrammes ensuring their benefits cascade to the

targeted layers of the economy without hindrance.Two key objectives of the FSCL were theformulation of policies to promote financial stabilityand to increase access to finance by localentrepreneurs, Small and Medium Enterprises

(SMEs) and the rural sector. The FSCL, co-chairedby the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank andDeputy Secretary to the Treasury, has l1 members.The FSCL had 7 meetings in 2005. Activities ofthe FSCL focused on a feasibility study of theproposed mandatory deposit insurance scheme,increased access to finance through the reform of

the postal savings units of the National Savings Bankand follow up on pending financial legislation.(ii) Financial Stability Committee (FSC): The remit ofthe FSC of the Central Bank is the assessment ofrisks and vulnerabilities leading to major financialsystem instabilities in the country andrecommending policies to promote financial systemstability which is one of the two statutoryobjectives of the Central Bank. As at end of 2005,the FSC's membership consisted of 13, i.e., twoDeputy Governors and 1l other members of thesenior management whose functions have a direct

bearing on financial system stability. The FSC had4 meetings in 2005.

Inaddition, with the approval of the Monetary Board,the FSC arranged to appoint a working group

consisting of regulatory authorities in the financialsystem to assess and monitor risks arising fromoperations of financial conglomerates in thecountry. Other areas of focus of the FSC were withregard to the proposal for a mandatory depositinsurance scheme as a financial safety netinstrument, implementation of a central databasefor monitonng on-line information of banks andfinance companies and oversight of the paymentssystem and the business continuity and disasterrecovery plans of financial institutions.

The Domestic Operations Depaftment continued to perform itsdual function of implementing the Bank's monetary policymainly through Open Market Operations (OMO) and enforcingStatutory Reserve Requirement (SRR), and functioning as thebanker to both commercial banks and the government. Inaddition, as an ancillary service, the department continued toprovide Intra day Liquidity Facility (ILF) to commercial banksand primary dealers to ensure the smooth functioning ofLankaSettle, the Real Time Gross Settlement system of thecountry.

4.1 Implementation of Monetary Policy

(a) Open Malket Operations (OMO)

The department continued to conduct OMO within theframework of market based monetary policy operations

introduced in 2003. Under this framework, OMO includedseveral operations: (a) conducting daily auctions either forrepurchase (Repo) transactions to absorb excess liquidity or

reverse repurchase (reverse Repo) transactions to inject liquidity,if there is a shortage of liquidity, on a daily basis, (b) provisionsof Repo and Reverse Repo facilities under standing facilities and(c) outright sales of Treasury bills or purchases of both Treasurybills (in the primary and secondary markets) and Treasury bonds(in the secondary market only) at the discretion of the CentralBank to absorb or inject liquidity on a long term basis. Monetarypolicy operations were conducted within a corridor of interest

rates formed by the Repo rate and the reverse Repo rate of theCentral Bank. Treasury bills were used as collateral for repo

transactions, while both Treasury bills and bonds were used for

reverse Repo transactions. All commercial banks and primary

dealers continued to be participating institutions (PIs) under the

system.During the year, the money market remained well liquidwith an excess liquidity of around Rs. 10.5 billion on average.During the first four months of the year, excess liquidity wasmuch higher at an average of Rs. 15.5 billion and remainedwithin a range of Rs. I brllion-26 billion. This high volume ofexcess liquidity was largely due to net inflows of foreign

exchange, particularly following the Tsunami devastation, which

were sold to the Central Bank. As such a high volume of excessliquidity would fuel credit expansion which was consideredalready hi-eh, the Central Bank commenced outright sales of

Treasury bills out of its holdings, in April 2005 to reduce excessliquidity on a perrnanent basis, while absorbing, on a daily basis,almost the entire excess liquidity through the daily auction.Immediately after the Tsunami devastation, it was consideredprudent to allow the banking system to operate with a highvolume of excess liquidity to ensure smooth operations of thecountry's payments and settlements system.(i) Daily Auction Under OMO

Repo Trartsactiorts

In line with the decision to allow the market to remain wellliquid during the first few months, the absorption of excessliquidity throu-eh the daily auction was initially reduced to about

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2005( xvrr )

Part llAccounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

50 per cent of the estimated excess liquidity and suspendedduring 5 January-21 February 2005. The daiiy auction was

recommenced on 2l February 2005 and the amount absorbed

throu-qh the auction was -eradually increased almost to the entire

estimated liquidity surplus by early March 2005.

The excess liquidity recorded on most days durin-e March-

December 2005, was absorbed on a daily basis tluou-eh the daily

auction by selling Treasury bills on a repurchases basis. On

avera_qe about Rs. l0 billion was offered to the auction and it

amounted to around 97 per cent of the estimated excess liquidity.

The value of bids received and the amount accepted were around

91 per cent and 92 per cent, respectively of the amount offered.

The daily auction was not conducted on five days in May, eight

days in June and five days in December as liquidity in the

banking system was broadly in balance.

The weighted average yield rate at the auction which was

7.88 per cent on 24 December 20M, the last business day prior

to Tsunami, declined to 7.59 per cent at the recommencementof the auction on 2l February 2005 and remained closer to the

lower bound of the corridor (7.50 per cent), till about end March

2005, mainly due to the absorption of a lesser amount of excessliquidity ttu'ou-eh the auction. Despite the absorption of almost

the entire excess liquidity through the daily auction since early

March, 2005 the yield rate continued to remain low initially asPIs were rather cautious in their bidding at the auction.

However, rates moved up gradually, towards the middle of the

interest rate conidor, particularly with the commencement of

outright sales of Treasury bills in April2005 to absorb liquidity

on a permanent basis.

Rev e rs e Repo T ran s act iott s

Since the introduction of the present system of monetary policy

operations, the first auction for reverse repurchase transactionwas held on 20 June 2005, the date on which there was aliquidity shortfall of around Rs. 3.7 billion. The auction was fully

subscribed and the amount offered, Rs.2 billion, was accepted

at 9.00 per cent, which happened to be the interest rate in themiddle of the interest rate corridor.(ii) Standing Facilities

Standing facilities were continued to be an avenue for those PIswhich were unable to manage their short term liquidity fullytluough transactions in the inter bank money market and at the

daily auction under OMO. These facilities were provided at the

Repo rate and the reverse Repo rate of the Central Bank, which

were increased by 125 basis points in four steps to 8.75 per cent

and I0.25 per cent, respectively by December 2005.

Repo Transactiorts

During the first three months of the year, there was a heavyvolume of Repo transactions under standing facilities (about Rs.

9 billion per day on avera,qe) as the absorption through the dailyauction was eithel suspended or reduced . Holever, durin-e the

rest of the year, as excess liquidity was absorbed primarilythrough the daily auction Repo transactions under standingfacilities were limited to about Rs. I billion per day on average.

Reve rs e Repo Trcut sctctiort s

Usually PIs obtain funds from the Centlal Bank throu-eh reverse

repurchase transactions when there is a shorta_ee of liquidity inthe bankin_q system. However, even when the liquidity isbroadly in balance or the market operates with relatively a small

surplus in liquidity, there has been reverse repurchase transitions

under standing facilities. This development was a reflection of

a rigidity in the market arising from self imposed limits of bankson their lending to other PIs, which made it difficult for some

PIs to raise funds in the inter bank market. Accordingly, reverse

Repo transactions under standing facilities helped contain thevolatility in the money market. On average, there were reverseRepo transactions of around Rs. 1.5 billion per day under

standing facilities on fifty-four days during the year.

(iii) Total Volume of Repo and Reverse RepoTransactions

Total volume of repo transactions under both the daily auction

and standin_e facilities amounted to Rs. 2,501billion in 2005, an

increase of 56 per cent from Rs. 1,602 billion in 2004. Totalvolume of reverse Repo transactions increased from Rs. 37billion in 2004 to Rs. 80 billion in 2005.

(iv) Outright Transactions

In order to absorb excess liquidity on a permanent basis, in April

2005, Central Bank commenced conductin-e auctions to sell

Treasury bills outn-eht, out of its own portfolio. During the year,

eighteen auctions were held and thirteen of them were well over-

subscribed. One auction was totally rqected as the bids receivedwere at unacceptably high yield rates. The total value of

Treasury bills sold was Rs. 37.2 billion which was around 85 per

cent of the amount offered for sale. These Treasury bills werevery short term with number of remaining days to maturity

ranging from 7 to 58 days (the majority between 32-45 days).

These sales were at yield rates, which were below the rates

comparable with the prevailing weighted average yield rate for9l day Treasury bills in the primary market at the time of each

out nght sale.

(b) Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR)

The Department continued to enforce SRR which remained atl0 per cent of deposit liabilities of commercial banks,

denominated in Sri Lanka rupees.

c) Bank Rate

The Central Bank's rate of interest (Bank rate) on short term

advances to licensed commercial banks, stipulated under Section

87 of the Monetary Law Act, remained unchan-eed at l5 per cent.

However, this rate was inoperative since no bank resorted to

borrow from the Central Bank at the bank rate.

4.2. Functioning as Banker to CommercialBanks and the Government

(a) Accounts of Financial Institutions

Facilitatin-e the Central Bank to operate as the Banker to banks,

the Department continued to provide cun'ent account facilities

to commercial banks and primary dealers to ensure an efficient

inter bank payment and settlement system. These accounts were

operated on a Real Time Gross Settlement basis within the

automated general ledger system of the Bank.

(b) Government Accounts

Facilitating the Central Bank to serve as the Banker to thegovemment, the department continued to maintain accounts of

government departments, -sovernment agencies and institutionsand certain statutory boards, providing them with required

banking facilities. The total number of such accounts maintained

by the bank stood at 33 at end 2005. During the year, six new

accounts were opened and 28 accounts were closed at the request

of the govemment. In terms of Section 89 of the Monetary LawAct, the Bank continued to provide provisional advances to thegovemment, The linut on such advances (10 per cent of the

estimated government revenue) was increased by Rs. 5.6 billionto Rs. 41.2 billion in 2005. There was no interest charged on

these advances.

4.3 Provision of Intra Day LiquidityFacility

The department continued to provide intra day liquidity facility(ILF), to commercial banks and primary dealers to ensure

smooth and efficient operations of LankaSettle. The dischargeof this responsibility included prompt dealing with requests ofparticipating institutions for intra day liquidity and their reversals

and promptly charging default interests on those who failed to

settle ILF before the close of business of LankaSettle on the

same day. ILF was continued to be provided free of charge

against the collateral of -eovernment Treasury bills and bonds.Securities were valued at their current market prices with asufficient 'hair cut' to cover possible variations in prices during

the day.The total value of ILF drawn during the year was Rs. 543billion. This amounted to ILF drawings of Rs. 2.3 billion per day

on avera-qe, which was slightly lower than the average of Rs. 2.7billion drawn in 2004. There were no ILF defaults byparticipants in 2005. The measures in place, including penaltyinterest at the Bank Rate and the suspension of the facility for

repeated defaults has ensured the prompt reversal of ILF before

the close of business of LankaSettle.5, Economic Research

Economic Research Department (ERD), functioning under theprovisions of Section 25 of the Monetary Law Act, prepared data

and conducted economic research fol the -{uidance of theMonetaly Board and the mana-qement of the Central Bank informulating, implementing, and executing monetary policywhile disseminatin-s the information to the public.

The preparation of data was conducted on a daily, weekly,monthly, quarterly, bi-annual and annualbasis on all important

economic frontiers. Some of the important economic datacompiled by ERD included the monetary survey, interest rates,the balance of payments, exchange rates and exchange rate

indices, foreign reserves position, trade indices, export proceedsmonitoring, budgetary outturn, industrial production index,agricultural production index, and Greater Colombo HousingApproval Index.Research activities were focused primarily on theformulation and implementation of monetary policy, followedby the appropnate design and implementation of other domestic

and external sector policies. In this regard, emphasis was placed

on further strengthening of the monetary policy decision makingframework, The department played a vital role in facilitating theMonetary Policy Committee (MPC) deliberations by providingcomprehensive economic analysis and inputs monthly on thecontinuation of or variations to the monetary policy stance, latersubmitting the reports incorporating views and concerns of theMPC to the Monetary Board. The Monetary Board decisions onthe monetary policy stance were disseminated to the marketthrough press releases, as per the pre-announced calendar. Inaddition to those, ERD staff continued to undertake research insubjects of contemporary importance. Some of the research

studies were published in the two volumes of "Staff Studies"

edited by ERD.The staff of ERD was also engaged in conducting joint

research with internationalorganizations, such as the SEACENCentre, SAARCFINANCE and UN ESCAP. Several seniorofficers of ERD served on various impoftant committees, bothwithrn and outside the Bank, Some of those are the preparatory

meetings on trade agreements with SAARC as a whole as well

as with individual countries such as Pakistan and the US. andworking on negotiations on a Comprehensive Economic

Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with India. They also served on

the Boards of Directors of several institutions, and as resourcepersons in training programmes conducted by the Centre forBanking Studies (CBS) and other foreign and localorganizations. The department provided inputs and participatedin the deliberations of various committees within the CentralBank such as the Market Operations Committee (MOC), theDomestics Debt Management Committee (DDMC) and theForeign Reserves Management Committee (FRMC) during theyear. The senior research officers of the department provided

assistance in the training of postgraduate degree aspirants of theCentral Bank and guided them on their research work. Thestabilization funds for tea, rubber and coconut have beenmanaged since its inception by the ERD as the Director ofEconomic Research is the Chairman of these funds. However,all credit balances of these funds were transfened to the GeneralTreasury as per a request made by the Treasury in 2005.

Preparing Bank's statutory repofis and other special reportsin all three lan-euages is a primary responsibility of the ERD.The department coordinated the publication of the Bank'sAnnual Report for 2004, Recent Economic Developments -Highlights of 2005 and Prospects for 2006, and the monthlybulletins in 2005. In addition, ERD was responsible for the

preparation of statutory reports which the Central Bank isrequired to submit to the Minister of Finance under the MLA.The department continued to disseminate informationthrough its statutory publications, publications of weekly andmonthly selected economic indicators, Central Bank website,and through press releases. ERD continued to issue monthly

press releases on Intemational Trade and quafterly press releaseson Balance of Payments in 2005. ERD continued to improvedata dissemination through improving the quality, coverage andtimeliness as well as widening the access.ERD continued to coordinate relationships withinternational multilateral financial organizations. ERDcoordinated Sri Lanka's relations with the IMF, especially theArticle IV consultations, the inter governmental Group ofTwenty Four (G-24), the SEACEN Centre for Research andTraining, the SEANZA group and the SAARCFINANCEgrouping of Central Bank Govemors and Finance Secretaries. In2005, ERD assisted the Ministry of Finance to coordinate workwith the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and othermultilateral and bilateraldonors. ERD was primarily responsiblefor organizing the SEACEN Executive Committee (Exco)

meeting in January 2005 and SAARCFINANCE seminar on'Combating Pyramid Schemes' in June 2005.ERD continued to train its officers in the areas of its corefunctions, using programs available both locally and overseaswith a view to improving staff skills. ERD staff attended weeklyand monthly seminar series of the Central Bank as well asimportant seminars and workshops held outside. The staff alsoconducted special weekly seminar series in the department todiscuss topical subjects of interest and to share knowledgegained by fellow officers from training prograrTrmes that they

have attended.

6. Employeest Provident Fund

In terms of the EPF Act, the Monetary Board is responsible forreceiving contributions, surcharges, and income frominvestments, maintaining accounts of registered employments,members and the Fund, investing of excess monies in suitableinvestments, and paying benefits to the members of the Fund.

These activities were carried out during 2005 in the close co-

ordination with the EPF Division of the Department of Labour.

6.1 System Improvements

Efficiency improvements were brought into various aspects of

the Fund's operations. Emphasis was placed on promoting theprocess of collecting member contribution data through

electronic media. The target is to enroll the employers with more

than 150 employees into this mechanism within the first half of

2006, so that about 75 per cent of contributing members will be

covered. A special project was established in 2005 to collect

updated information relating to non-contributing members of theFund. The purpose of this task is to send the annual statements

to members with regard to their non-contributing accounts also

(XX)Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2005

Part llAccounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

in the future. (Currently, EPF sends the semi-annual member

statements only to the contributing members). This is an

important step towards the improved member disclosure policy

of the Fund. The EPF website (www.epf.lk) was redesigned in

order to provide a better interaction with stakeholders. All forms

relavent to EPF matters can now be downloaded by the EPF

members and employers from the web site. A tender was

awarded to procure, install and commission an accounting and

investment package where the installation would be completed

during the second quarter of 2006. This computer package would

ensure the efficiency and accuracy of general accounting,

investment and risk management functions of the EPF.The annual member statements for 2004 and the semi-

annual member statements for the first half of 2005 were issuedto members through their employers during 2005. Efficiencyimprovements, which have already been brou-eht in to the

operations, enabled the EPF to issue these statements 2-3 months

earlier than the previous year.6.2 Public Awareness and MemberDisclosures

The awareness programme continued in 2005 focusing on all

stakeholders of the Fund. The Help Desk continued to gainpopularity among members in attending to member inquiries

promptly. During the year, eleven mobile services were conductedin the estate sector, which provided real-time solutions for the

discrepancies in the EPF databases. A series of seminars were held

for the employers to help them follow an enor-fire process of EPF

remittance and promote the electronic media data submission. Amanual on EPF ooerations named 'Sevaka Arthasadaka

Aramudale Athpotha' was also published in 2005.6.3 Capacity Building in the EPF

The skills development activities of the EPF staff werecontinued. The participants shared their knowledge andexperience gained from local and foreign training mainlythrough seminars and articles. An environment to practice theacquired knowledge was also provided. After the successfulcompletion of the fund mana-qement training pro-qramme of two

years, thirteen young professionals were recruited to the variousunits of the Fund Management Division. The purpose of thesecapacity-building activities is to enrich the Fund with competent

human resources, to bring service excellence.6.4 Housing Loan FacilitiesA facility is available for EPF members from 1988 to obtain a

loan for housing purposes from approved lending institutionskeeping their EPF balances as collateral. During 2005, EPF

issued 14,600 member bal ance certifi cati ons for a total approved

credit amount of Rs.2,766 mn. A second loan is also availableupon the successful settlement of the first loan. However,

although the lending institutions charge a penal rate of about 36

per cent per annum on the amounts defaulted, the members tendto default the repayment of the loans. Since the defaulted

amount together with a penal interest is deducted from therelevant EPF member's account and paid to the lendinginstitution by the EPF. In these instances, the members'

retirement savings get eroded. Fufther, defaulters are not entitledfbr a second loan or a loan at 4 per cent interest rate underShramodha Home Loan Scheme. Table II - 5 shows the

increasing trend of the housing loan details.6.5 Shamodha Home Loan Scheme forEPF MembersA new housing loan scheme named " Shramodha Home Loan

Scheme" was launched in December 2005 with the initiationof the Ministry of Labour Relations and Foreign Employment,to grant housing loans up to a maximum of Rs. 300,000 toeligible EPF members meeting specified criteria, at aconcessionary rate of 4 per cent. Housing DevelopmentFinance Corporation (HDFC) and State Mortgage andInvestment Bank (SMIB) are the participating creditinstitutions. In granting the loan, the participating creditinstitution would ascertain the repayment capacity of the EPF

members, based on their own credit evaluation guidelines. In

case of default of a loan obtained under this scheme, the lendinginstitution would acquire the property. Accordingly, no

entitled for a loan under the new scheme. This concessionaryrate housing loan scheme would facilitate the members to

possess a house or property of their own at an affordable costwhile minimizing the defaults of the EPF pledged loan scheme,6.6 Investment Activities and Returns

During the year, the total investment portfolio of the Fund grewby 12.5 per cent, recording a value of Rs 405 billion as at end2005. Sustaining the last 8-year trend, the investments in

Treasury Bonds - a long{erm marketable investment instrument,

further incrcased to 83 per cent of the total investment portfolio

as at end 2005, as against 77 per cent in the previous year. The

investments in Govemment Rupee securities - a non-marketable

its portfolio in government securities. The market rates ofTreasury bonds prevailed at a low level of 8- I I per cent in 2004and 2005 compared with a range of 15-22 per cent in 2001.Chart II-4 shows the movemant in the government securitiesrates during last four years. Therefore, the realizable rate ofreturn of the EPF portfolio in 2005 further declined in line withthe long-term market interest rate trend.Overall, the long-term bullish trend in the equity marketthat commenced in 2001 continued during the year underreview also, despite the short-term fluctuations. The marketcontinued to gain momentum and the ASPI reached an all timehigh of 2551 points in mid November. Tension emerged in

peace front caused the overall market to decline by 27 per centby the latter part of 2005, which, however, eased at thebeginning of 2006. EPF could build up its listed equity portfbliowith long-term profit potential investmenrs while realizingshort-term profits also from temporary market fluctuations. Thetotalrealized return by EPF from its equity investments during2005 amounted to Rs 908 million or 39 per cent from theaverage equity investment (Table II-6). During rhe entireinvestment period of eight years from 1998 to 2005, EPF couldearn a healthy return of 23 per cent on avera-qe from the equityinvestment portfolio. Equity investment however, amountedonly to 0.7 per cent of the total EPF porrfolio as at end 2005.

Capital gains realised from government securities declinedin 2005 compared to 2004 due to non-conducive marketsituation. However, the equity portfolio generated a capital gainof Rs. 817 million in 2005, which is an increase of 150 per centfrom Rs. 318 million recorded in2004. The peformance of theequity investments could compensate the drop in capital gainsfrom the government securities and enabled the EPF to reahse

a total capital gain of Rs. 1,591 million in 2005 which is Rs. 43million higher than the total capital gain of 2004 (Table II-7),

7. Exchange Gontrol

The management and regulation of receipts and payments

of foreign exchange inflows to and out flows from the countryis the key function of the Exchange Control Department(ECD). In the year 2005, all foreign exchange payments

and receipts relating to current account transactions and some

capital account transactions continued to be permined withoutrestrictions through commercial banks appointed as

Authonzed Dealers in foreign exchange and allowing themto use their judgement and discretion subject to exercising

customer due diligence. In addition to authorized dealers,

money changers, tourist hotels, travel agencies and duty free

shops continued to deal in foreign exchange for specific

purposes. These include exchanging and accepting foreign

currency notes and coins, issuing foreign exchange in theform of Travellers Cheques and currency notes, and

reconverting unspent Sri Lanka rupees of foreigners into

foreign currency. In 2005, ECD, as a part of its managementand regulatory functions, continued to issue operatinginstructions and guidelines to Authorized Dealers and

restricted foreign exchange dealers, conducted on-site andoff-site supervisions, monitored their foreign exchangetransactions and imposed penalties on corporate and

unincorporated bodies and individuals for violating theprovisions of Exchange Control Act. In addition, the

Department continued to grant permission, on certain capital

account transactions such as investment abroad by Sri Lankan

companies bonowing in foreign exchange, transfers to Sri

Lankans migrated to other countries, etc. Another significant

development in 2005 was the scheme evolved by the ECDin consultation with Electronic Fund Transfer Card (EFTC)

issuing banks to clear any doubts with regard to the purposes

for which card holders are permitted to make foreign exchange

payments and also to make card holders aware that they

are responsible for the payments made on their cards. A

notice was published in this regard in the Government GazetteNo.l4lli5 of September lgth, 2005 under the Exchange

Control Act. This was sequel to the large scale abuse of

EFTCs detected in 2003 and 2004 to make payments to

pyramid schemes conducted via Internet.

7.1 Major Developments in 2005

In 2005, progress was made in improving the country's foreign

exchange management system. Si-enificant among them is theintroduction of a scheme to monitor repatriation of export

proceeds. Information on export proceeds was gathered through

a micro level survey conducted on quarterly basis covering

nearly 3000 BOI and non-BOI exporters. During the year 2005,

the Sri Lanka Rupee Account scheme, titled, Post Tsunami

Inward Remittance Account (PTIRA), was introduced for all

Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) as a disbursement

account for inward remittances received by them for their social

development and relief activities in the country. Funds receivedby these accounts were published regularly in the print andelectronic media. By further relaxing Exchange Controls,

airlines were permitted to quote prices of air tickets in US

dollars. As an added incentive to the export sector, a foreign

currency account scheme was also introduced for indirect

exporters titled "lndirect Exporters Foreign Cunency Account"(IEFCA) to allow indirect exporters to receive payments in

foreign culrency from direct exporters.

In the area of supervision and regulation, new criteria was

introduced for the appointment of money changers requiring

new and existing money changing companies to raise their

equity capital from Rs. I million to Rs. 10 million with a view

to raise their financial soundness. Further, a scheme to educate

Electronic Fund Transfer Card (EFTC) holders, the type of

foreign exchange payments permitted ttrough their cards; and

making them responsible for the payments made on their cards

to non-resident entities was introduced in 2005.

7.2 Capital Transactions

(a) Investments

Existing Exchange Control regulations relating to investmentsin Sri Lanka by non-residents and investments abroad by

resident Sri Lankan companies remained unchanged during the

year 2005. BOI continued to be the facilitator of the foreign

direct investment in Sri Lanka. In case of investment abroad by

Sri Lankan companies, ECD evaluated their proposals and made

recommendations on such proposals on their merit to the Hon.

Minister of Finance. In 2005, fifteen Sri Lankan companies were

permitted to invest US dollars 38.42 million in Joint Ventures,fully owned subsidiaries and branch offices abroad.

(b) Foreign Currency Borrowings

Bonowin-q abroad by resident companies other than companies

approved by the BOI under Section 17 of the BOI Law with full

exemption from the provisions of the Exchange Control Act

requires prior approval of the Central Bank. During the year

under review, the Department -{ranted permission to twofinancial institutions and two resident companies to borrow

funds totalling US dollars 22.26 million,

7.3 Trade Transactions

ECD continued to monitor import of goods for which payments

had been made in advance with a view to ensure the arrival of

such impoft of goods to the country. A si-enificant chan_ee in thearea of trade transactions in 2005 was the limit of advancepayment stipulated for imports in Regulation 2(i) (d) publishedin the Government Gazette (Extraordinary) No.102216 of 8,hApril 1998, which was enhanced from US dollars. 7,500f up toUS dollars10,000/- in terms of a regulation made by the Hon.Ministerof Trade Commerce & ConsumerAffairs and publishedin the Govemment Gazette (Extraordinary) No. I393l2l of 20,hMay,2005.

7.4 Registration of Freight Forwardersand Issue of Permits to Engage inForeign Exchange Transactions

ECD continued to register freight forwarders, granf travelagencies the authority to issue Travellers' Cheques and issuelicenses to money changers and other establishments such ashotels, duty free shops, travel agencies, etc. to accept foreign

curTency.

(a) Registration of Freight Forwarders

During the year 2005, 42 new companies were registered asfreight forwarders bringing the total number of companresregistered as freight forwarders to 173 at the end of the year. Theincrease in the registration of frei_eht forwarders in 2005,compared with the previous year was mainly due to the newregulations made by the Hon. Minister of Ports & Aviation underSection l0 read with Section 3 of the Licensing of ShippingAgents Act No,l0 of 1972, published in rhe ExtraordinaryGazette Notification No.l402l19 of 22"d July 2005, enforcing arequirement to the companies carry on the business of a FreightForwarder/I.{on-Vessel Operating Common Camer in Sri Lankaunder the said regulations to obtain a licence issued by theDirector of Merchant Shipping. ECD continued to monitorcredits and debits made to the Rupee Accounts maintained byShipping and Ailline Agents as well as freight forwarders onbehalf of their foreign pnncipals/agents durin-e the year.(b) Issuance of Licences to Money ChangersIn 2005, the ECD issued l3 new licences to companiesregistered in Sri Lanka to enga_qe in money changing businessunder the criteria introduced by the Central Bank for theappointment of money changers in 1999. The criteria waschanged with effect from May 2005, raisin-q the required capital,for a company to be appointed as a money changing companyfrom Rs. I million to Rs. l0 million. Since rhe introduction ofthe new criteria, 5 applications were received and one suchapplication was approved upon fulfilment of the requirementsset out in the new criteria, thus brin-qin-s the total number.ofauthorized money chan_eers to 62 as at 3l', December, 2005.

Their total foreign currency purchases, which were subsequentlytendered to Authorized Dealers, amounted to US dollars 70million in 2005.

7.5 Monitoring

Since the liberalisation of Exchange Controls in 1994,Authonzed Dealers and approved Travel A_qents were permittedto release foreign exchange without restriction on currentaccount transactions, exercising their judgement and discretionand after satisfying themselves with the bona fides of therequests. All Authorized Dealers and approved travel agents arerequired to repofi to ECD of their sales and purchases of foreignexchange on a regular basis for monitoring purposes, Foreignexchange sales over US dollars 5,000 per person are required tobe reported daily, while sales less than US dollars 5,000 perperson are to be reported on a weekly basis. In the case offoreign exchange releases through Electronic Fund TransferCards (EFTCs), card issuing banks are required to providedetailed monthly reports on EFTCs where monthly cumulative

forei_qn exchange expenditure per person exceeds US dollars5,000 per month. Releases of foreign exchange are monitoredwith a view to detect unauthorized capital transfers and fundslinked to financing of tenorism or money laundering activities.At present, only the head offices and few outstation branches ofcommercial banks are electronically linked to ECD for thetransmission of data on their foreign exchange transactions.

7.6 Investigations

Investigations into alleged violatjons of the provisions of theExchange Control Act by individuals and corporate bodies rvereconducted in 2005. After the conclusion of the investigations,total of Rs. 29.4 million was imposed in respectof 29 cases forviolating the provisions of the Exchange ControlAct. Out of theabove sum, Rs. 28 million recovered as penalties were creditedto "Exchange Control Penalties Account" maintained with theCentral Bank. In 2005, the ECD conducted a search at a businesspremises in Colombo on receiving information that unauthorisedfbreign exchange dealings were carried out at the premises, andrecovered foreign currency notes equivalent to Rs. 1.6 million.The proprietor of the premises involved in the unauthorisedforeign currency dealings was prosecuted in court.

8. Information

In 2005, the Information Technology Department (ITD) mainly

concentrated on consolidating its activities in the past few years

by strengthening the disaster recovery facilities and establishing

Business Continuity Plans (BCPs) to quickly resume critical

operations in the event of a major operational failure. In addition,

the department continued its efforts to expand the IT facilitiesin the Central Bank and to improve the IT skills of the Bank's

staff.

The functions performed by the depaltment are as follows:(a) Strengthening of disaster recovery facilities, businesscontinuity planning & management ;(b) Improving the IT skills of employees ;(c) IT infrastructure enhancements l(d) Further automation of the functions handled by the user

departments to enhance productivity ;(e) Maintenance of the payments system, computer networks

and other critical applications to ensure maximum systemavailability ;(0 Identification of risks to IT systems through surveys andthe implementation of remedial measures to mitigate

operation risks.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2005(xxv)

Part llAccounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Currently, the Central Bank operates in a predominantly

automated environment. This environment has necessitated theCentral Bank to device methods to mitigate the risks fromoperational breakdowns throu-eh business continuity planning,

redundancies in operational capacities and establishing remotelylocated disaster recovery sites. Accordingly, a BCP was

prepared to identify possible contin_eency events and remedialaction and to ensure the continuity of operations from theDisaster Recovery Site (DRS). The site was equipped withfurniture, computers and communication equipment needed forabout forty contingency staff to take over the resumption ofprocesses identified as critical. Several trial tests wereconducted during the year with the participation of thecontingency staff of the Central Bank and participants from thecommercial banks, Primary Dealers and other foreigncounterpafties in international payment transactions. The mock

operations from the DRS have enabled the contingency staff to

be familiar with the facilities at the DRS, by providing hands-on training and building confidence to handle and managecontrngency events.

The IT Department has been providing technicalassistancewith regard to IT related purchases and services of the CentralBank as well as other government organizations. During theyear under review, the following infrastructure enhancements

were made to strengthen the reliability of the systems:(a) Upgraded the i-senes (AS/400) computer systems at theCentral Bank Primry & Disaster Recovery Sites to meet

the expanding capacity demand and facilitate the businessresumption from the DRS.(b) Installation of the Intemet firewall and the external accessfirewall.(c) Installation of SQLAVeb Servers.(d) Implementation of the Central Authentication system(Digital Certification) for web application security.(e) Upgrade of the Real Time Gross Settlement/Scripless

Securities Trading System software to CAS 3.3 from CAS2.68, which has more user friendly features.(f) Expansion of Internet line capacity from 256 Mbps to512 Mbps to expand the user coverage and facilitate thedevelopment of web-based applications.(g) Wide Area Network connectivity was chan-eed to IPVPNtechnology to ensure automatic connectivity to the DRSduring a contin_eency event.

The Central Bank network currently has over 1000computers connected directly to the network. In this networkenvironment, around 900 e-mail addresses and 300 internet

connections have been provided to facilitate office automation

and easy access to information.The IT Department continued to uplitl the IT skills ofemployees through providin_q resource persons to conduct ITrelated courses at the Centre for Banking Studies (CBS).

Re-qular meetin-es were also held with Departmental Liaison

officers to educate them on improved security features and toprovide guidelines on good practice of computer use. With theintroduction of the IT Security Policy in the bank durin 92005,severalawareness programs were also conducted to educate thestaff on policy guidelines.

One of the major responsibilities of the IT Depaftment wasto maintain the payment systems, namely the Real Time Gross

Settlement System (RTGS), the Scripless Securities SettlementSystem (SSSS), the Treasury Dealing Room ManagementSystem (TDRMS) and the General Ledger System (GLS), toensure maximum availability for real time settlement oftransactions. As at 31" December 2005, the ITD has been ableto achieve an uptime of 99.40 per cent for the Payment systems.

The application software used forRTGS/SSS systems, thatis, CAS 2.68, was upgraded to CAS 3.3 which has enhanced

features and is necessary to accommodate SWIFT upgrade. TheITD was responsible for the overall coordination with thesoftware suppliers who also maintain the systems to ensure

smooth operations of the Payment systems.As a policy, the IT Department has decided to develop allfuture applications in the web environment whenever possiblefor easy maintenance. As an initial project, a Central Data basesystem to receive information from commercial banks wasimplemented for the Bank Supervision Department, which isexpected to be expanded to the Non-Banking Financial andEconomic Research areas, A web based system was alsodeveloped to store information on all movements of ownershipof government securities in the Central Depository System tofacilitate convenient access bv the beneficial owners. of such

secuntles.

In addition, as a means of automating the functions of theCentral Bank, developing of several application softwareprojects were undertaken . They were as follows:(a) Foreign Loans Repayment System ;(b) Dollar Bond Issue System ;(c) System to record currency movements between vaults '(d) Export proceeds monitoring system ;(e) Automation of the Government Treasury Bills/BondsSystem ;(D Stores Management System for the Canteen ;(g) System to monitor maintenance agreements and payments.

In addition, the IT Department continued to maintain allapplications developed in-house and operational in the CentralBank. The EPF System, which is one of the major ITapplications of the Central Bank also was maintained andrequired software modifications and enhancements were madeto the system.

The IT Security Policy of the Central Bank and the BCP forall Payment systems were implemented during the year underreview. The documents were further updated to accommodatethe needs of the chan-qing environment and the updateddocuments were approved by the Monetary Board. The IT

Strategy Plan and Procedure Manuals were also prepared during

2005.

External expertise was obtained as a means of miti-eating

security threats by educating the ITD officers on identification

and analysis of Risks. A survey on IT system security was also

conducted in order to identify the areas to be strengthened.

{ 0. International Operations

10.1 Foreign Exchange Reserve Management

International Operations Department (IOD) of the Central Bankof Sri Lanka manages the country's official international

reserves to facilitate maintenance of intemational stability of the

Sri Lanka rupee and to assure the greatest possible freedom of

its cunent international transactions. The IOD ensures liquidity

and security of the foreign exchange reserves whenever such

reserves are employed to earn sufficient returns. The Monetary

Law Act No. 58 of 1949 requires the Central Bank to maintain

an adequate international reserve in liquid currencies and a

nuclear reserve in gold, in order to achieve the objectives

mentioned above.

The official foreign culrency reserve of the country was

mainly invested in highly rated sovereign government securities,

government guaranteed securities, and securities of government

agencies and supra national institutions. Liquidity requirements

were fulfilled through maintenance of sufficient proportions of

reserves in liquid fixed income securities portfolio and money

market portfolio in different cunencies. Both money market and

fixed income securities transactions were done through highly

rated counterparties. In 2005, the Central Bank's foreign

exchange reserve assets were held mainly in US dollars, euros,

sterling pounds, Australian dollars and gold.

Investments of international reserves were carried out by

the IOD in accordance with the guidelines set by the Foreign

Reserve Management Commrttee (FRMC) and approvedby theMonetary Board. The conduct of investment activities were

measured against a predefined benchmark approved by theFRMC. In addition, the FRMC regularly reviewed the

composition of assets, risk appetite communicated through the

predefined benchmark and the overall performance of reserve

man a_qement operatron s.IOD made necessary changes to currency and asset

compositions of the international reserve from time to time after

reviewin-e changes in the economic fundamentals and geo-political developments in the international financial centres,major currencies and the interest rate environment. All

investments were made through approved counterparties within

the risk management framework approved by the Monetary

Board payin-q due consideration to safety, liquidity and return on

such assets. The Banks' debt service requirements and income

generatin-e abilities were also considered in determining

portfolio composition of the foreign exchange reserve.

Appropriate portfolio adjustments were made to preserve the

value of the portfolio and to minimize the impact of market risk

regularly from fluctuating interest rates. The total net foreignincome generated through the forei-en exchange reserve

management operations was US dollars 77 million or Rs. 1,603

million during the year 2005. This was in excess of the budgeted

income from reserve management operations amounting to USdollars 73.1 million and was achieved in a continuously

increasing interest rate environment in which all previous

investments were yielding low returns.IOD ventured into complete electronic deal capturing and

processing operations and completed the process of redefining

the internal benchmark for better communication of risk

preferences and investment targets as well as for accurate

measuring of reserve management performance during the year.

10.2 Risk Management

Foreign exchange risk, market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and

operational risk are the major risks associated in reserve

management. The Middle Office of IOD monitors the risk

associated with foreign exchange reserve management acttvtttes.Foreign exchange risk is the risk of capital loss as a

consequence of fluctuations in exchange rates. The Bank

managed the exchange rate risk by diversifying its holdings of

foreign exchan-{e reserye assets among different cunencies. The

currency distribution of the portfolio was reviewed and adjusted

periodically to suit the targeted outcome. Interest rate risk or the

exposure of the Bank's investment to movements in interest rate

was assessed at portfolio levels in various culrency segments and

against the internal benchmark. The deviation of the investment

portfolio from the internal benchmark were assessed periodically

and compared against the approved levels.The credit risk was managed by establishing eligibility

requirements, confining exposures to high quality instruments,giving individual credit risk limits to issuers, counterparties andfinancial instruments in terms of counterparty credit risk

management system approved by the Monetary Board and

based, among other factors, on the creditworthiness of individualparties and credit ratings by independent rating agencies.Liquidity risk is the risk of the Bank incurring losses or

significantly higher costs than estimated due to its failure to meet

its payment obligations on time. To reduce the liquidity risk the

major part of the international reserve was invested in liquid

financial instruments with shorter matunttes.A range of measures were in place to mana-ee the

operational risk ori-einating from human etrors, flawed systems,

inadequate procedures and controls, i.e. se-ere-gation of different

functions of transaction processing and monitoling; having a

decision makin-e committee charged with the function of the

mana-qement of foreign reserves (FRMC), buildin-e controls into

the dealing operations, strengthening internal controls and

processes etc. Automated as well as manual back up procedureswere in place to-eether with a set of comprehensive guidelines

on reserve management activities comprisin,e of specific controls

and procedures in order to mitigate the impact of possible systemflaws and failures.A voice recording system was installed to capture deal

conversations in the front office to miti_sate the operational risksresulting from possible disputes between the counterparties and

the Central Bank commencing from January 2005.

10.3 Monitoring the Domestic ForeignExchange Market Developments

IOD continued to monitor closely the developments in thedomestic foreign exchan-{e market and overnight net foreign

exchange open positions of commercial banks in order to ensuresmooth functioning of the domestic foreign exchange market

and orderly adjustment of the exchange rate of the Sri Lanka

rupee during 2005.The Sri Lanka rupee stood at 102.12 per US dollar asat 31.12.2005, as compared to 104.61 per US dollar on31.12.2004 indicating an appreciation of 2.44 per cent.Weakening of other major cunencies in the internationalmarket has resulted in relative appreciation of the Sri Lankarupee against these cunencies. The volume of inter-bankforeign exchange transactions have increased by 69 per cent(US dollars 2,966 million) to US dollars 7,245 million in2005 compared to US dollars 4,279 million in 2004. TheCentral Bank was on both sides of the market to moderatethe excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the Sri Lankarupee. The purchases and sales of foreign exchange from andto commercial banks at market rates during the year wereUS dollars 290 million and US dollars 464 millionrespectively.The department continued the process of providingindicative exchange rates of the Sri Lanka rupee on variouscurrencies to Government Departments and Corporations andother relevant parlies durin_e the year,

10.4 Operating Instructions, Circulars andDirections issued during 2005

A new direction was issued during the yeal to the domesticforeign exchange market on financial derivative products inforeign exchange in order to bring the emerging derivativemarket under formal re_eulatory umbrella. These directions areexpected to help diversifying the domestic financial marketwhile making it broader and deeper, This direction permits thecommercial banks in the country to de al in identified derivativeproducts namely Interest Rate Swaps (lRS), Interest RateOptions (IRO), Forward Rate A-ereements (FRA), Non-LKROptions (NLO), Cross Currency Swaps (CCS) not involvin_e SriLanka rupees and Commodity Options limited to selectedindustrial products and precious metals.

11, Legal

In 2005, the Legal Department of the Central Bank continued itsservices in advising the Bank on le-qal matters, representing theBank in courts and other legal fbra and contributin_q to the legalreforms in the banking and financial sector.During the year, the Legal Depaftment continued its effortin reviewin-9 the existing legalfi'amework while introducing newlegislation to facilitate the smooth functionin_e of the financialsystem. Addressing many uncertainties and lacunas that existedin the Bankin-e Act, No. 30 of 1988 and widening the scope ofthe regulatory controls, the Banking (Amendment)Act No. 2 of2005 was passed in February 2005. The most si_Qnificantprovisions introduced by this amendment are the 'fit and proper'guidelines for directors, strengthening of provisions to minimisethe concentration of ownership of licensed banks andstrengthening ofthe governance aspects oflicensed banks. Theinterpretation of the term 'deposit' was also introduced with

these amendments by which the depositor protection aspects

have been strengthened. These amendments have also played asignificant role in safeguardin-e the stability of the financial

system of Sri Lanka.Another important development dunng the year 2005 wasthe enactment of the Payment and Settlement Act which will

strengthen the legal framework goveming payment services asefficient and reliable functioning payment system contributes toimprove the soundness and smooth functioning of the financialsystem, This carries provisions for the re_eulation of thepayment, clearing and settlement systems, for the regulation ofproviders of money services, for the elechonic presentment of

cheques.The Finance Leasin,e Act was amended, amon_q other

thin-{s, enabling the leasing companies to securitise their leaseportfolios. This would enable the finance leasing companies tofinance their workin-e capital needs which, in turn, would easetheir liquidity shortfall issues. However, broader issues relatingto securitisation in general are also under consideration with aview to introduce more _qeneric legislation on the subject.The Legal Department worked closely rvith several otherdepartments of the Bank and outside _qovernment a_eencies toprepare legislation on prevention of money launderin-e andfinancin,a of terrorism. Sri Lanka joined the global effort to

combat money-laundering and terrorist financing by passin-e theConvention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financin,q Act inmid 2005. The Bills on Prevention of Money Laundering andFinancial Transactions Reporfing were presented to thelegislature in 2005 and passed in January 2006.

12. Management Audit

The Mana-qement Audit Department (MAD) continued toconduct risk based independent audit durin_e 2005 and provided

su-{gestions to add value and improve Bank's operations and

( xxvrr )Central Bank ol Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2005

systems of controls, so as to contribute eff-ectively to achieve its

strate,ei c obj ecti ve s.The Audit Committee of the Monetary Board, too

performed its role in overseeing the preparation of the AnnualAudit Plan, audit process, financial statements of the Central

Bank, the related financial reporting practices and the systems

of internal controls. The MAD functioned as the secretariat of

the Audit Committee.In accordance with the Audit Charter, the Annual Audit

Plan for 2005 was prepared on a risk based audit approach. As

planned, several audit assignments were conducted to review the

adequacy of the internal controls, introduced to plotect theCentral Bank from potential risks while continuing with

compliance audits to verify that the established controls are

functioning as intended, As in the previous yeal', follo"v-up audit

reviews were also canied out to ascertain the implementation of

audit recommendations.The Management Audit Department reported significant

issues related to processes for controllin,e actions of the Central

Bank and also periodically provided information on the status

and results of the Annual Audit Plan to the management and the

Audit Committee.The major audit activities undertaken during the yearincluded the review of the payroll system of the Bank(outsourced to Ms. Ernst & Young), review of insurancepolicies of the Bank, procurement of goods for general

maintenance, review of activities in the Re-eional Offices at

Anuradhapura, Matale and Matara, analysis on the usage of

cab services, fuel consumption and repair cost of the Bankvehicles, claim settlements under the Credit Guarantee

Schemes of SMAP, MCPCDP, ARP & SMI IV and analysisof expenditure of the Printing Press, physical verification of

stocks in the currency vaults, stores in the Re-eional Officesand Engineering Stores.During 2005, the Department took initiative to formulate

and implement a bank-wide risk management framework under

the guidance of the Committee to assess the bank-wide risks.The lManagement Audit Department also issued rules and

-euidelines on risk management to all the deparlments. In housesoftware was developed and installed in all departments to

capture risks identified by the departments with a view tomonitor bank-wide risks. Under the Mana-qement Audit

Department's initiative and ,euidance, the compilation processof the departmental operation manual was successfully

completed in 2005.In order to build professionalism in intelnal and

mana-qement audit, arran-qements were made for the US based

Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) to conduct its examinationsin Sri Lanka. The Department has been actively collaboratin-uwith the Sri Lanka Branch of IIA to promote its course and the

Central Bank is accordin-ely represented on both its Governin-e

Council and the Academic Board.

13. Payments And Settlements

Stren-sthening of payment system oversight, legal framework

and business continuity planning were given a high priority inthe activities of the Payments and Settlements Department(PSD) during 2005, as a part of fulfilling the Central Bank's

objective of promoting a sound, stable an efficient financial

system. PSD operated the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)

System which serves as the backbone of the payment and

settlement infrastructure; processed and effected payment and

settlement instructions in respect of the Central Bank's foreign

exchange management operations and Open Market Operations(OMO); handled Bank's SWIFT communications; operated the

payment gateway for the Bank's own transactions; and effected

transactions under the Asian Clearing Union (ACU).

L3.1 Operating the Real Time GrossSettlement (RTGS) System

The RTGS Operations Division continued to operate the System

and to provide help desk services to participants. The value of

transactions settled through the RTGS System dunng the year2005 was Rs.17,543 billion, about 7 times higher than the

annual gross domestic product of Sri Lanka. The daily average

volume and value of transactions settled in 2005 were 629 and

Rs.74 billion respectively. At end December 2005 there were

32pwticipants in the RTGS System including the Central Bank,

22licensed commercialbanks, 8 non-bank Primary Dealers and

the Employees Provident Fund.

13.2 SWIFT Communications

During 2005, the SWIFT Communication Division handled all

SWIFT related activities of the Central Bank. The deparlment

was involved in the following modifications and upgrading of

the SWIFT system of the Central bank:(a) UpgTadin-e the "SWIFT Alliance Access" at the primary

site from version release 5.00 to version lelease 5.5;(b) Up-erading of the SWIFTNeI Link (SNL) at the primary

site from SNL 4,40 ro SNL 5.00: and(c) Updating of MT 5XX series with the new version.

13.3 Transactions under the Asian ClearingUnion (ACU)

The total vaiue of transactions of Sr i Lanka effected through theACU mechanism increased mar-einally by 4 per cent fromRs.l6l billion in2004 to Rs.l67 billion in 2005. However, the

total value of exports to other ACU countries recorded a growth

of 38 per cent in 2005, when compared with that of 2004. This

was mainly due to the increase of exports to India and Iran.

The rupee value of net settlements made under the ACU

mechanism durin-e 2005 amounted Rs.l38 biilion, a drop of 3

per cent when compared with the previous year.

The 34u' Meeting of the Board of Directors of the AsianClearing Union was held in Lahore, Pakistan in May, 2005. Adecision was taken at this meeting to appoint a technicalcommittee comprising representatives from all member

countries to study and make recommendations on the future roleof the ACU.

13.4 Payment System Policy and Oversight

Payment system oversight was focused on (a) strengthening ofthe payment system landscape and (b) persuading LankaSettleparticipants to have business continuity plans (BCP) with fullyequipped disaster recovery sites (DRS) benchmarked tointernational standards to continue operations in a prolonged andwidespread disruption. Having recognized the varying riskprofile of different payment systems, PSD continued to adopt arisk based approach in overseeing payment and settlementsystems. Oversight activities included monitoring andevaluating of systemically and system-wide important payment

systems against their objectives, rules, regulations, best practicesand where necessary to induce changes for furtherdevelopments. Accordingly, oversight scope included:systemically important payment and securities settlementsystems operated by the Central Bank (RTGS system, ScriplessSecurities Settlement system and Scripless SecuritiesDepository); and system-wide important retail payment systems

PSD monitored the operations of LankaSettle participants

as a parl of its normal day to day operations and took appropriatemeasures to ensure the timely settlement of clearing balancesand to reduce settlement risk. These measures include theimposition of a default char_ee on licensed commercial banksintroduced with the amendment made to clause 8.3 of volume2 of LankaSettle System Rules, with effect from October l,2005, for the failure to maintain adequate funds in their RTGSSettlement Accounts for settling net clearing obligations atstipulated times, to ensure the timely settlement of clearingbalances and to reduce settlement risk.Having considered the consequences of systemic risk,which could be caused by operational disruptions of LankaSettleparticipants, the Central Bank requested all LankaSettleparticipants to have documented BCPs by end March 2005.PSD held one to one meetings with each participant to explainthe required standards of BCP and, advised them to submitrevised BCPs by end August 2005. A set of guidelines on BCPwas drafted by the PSD and forwarded to Sri Lanka Banks'Association (Guarantee) Ltd. and the Association of PrimaryDealers to obtain their comments,In early 2005, PSD was actively involved in the postimplementation review of the LankaSettle System conducted by

a team from the Sveriges Riks Bank (Central Bank of Sweden).The review too established that the implementation ofLankaSettle System and the law reforms have significantlyreduced settlement, operational and legal risks previously borneby the Central Bank and participants.

14. Premises

The Premises Department continued to carry out themaintenance and upkeep of the Bank's premises during the year

2005, in addition to providing support services such as transportand communication facilities to officers of the BankMost of the maintenance work and a part of the transportservices have been outsourced with a view to obtaining servicesmore efficiently and at lowest cost.By the end of 2005, all departments of the Bank have beenprovided with modern furniture and Venetian blinds, therebyproviding further conveniences to the employees and creating aconducive working environment.

function of debt management, which involves the issuance and

management of domestic debt and servicing of both domesticand foreign debt of the government.'Accordingly, the

department has to ensure that the govemment financing needs

are met at the lowest possible cost over the medium to long run,

consistent with a prudent degree of risk and meeting the payment

obligations in time. During 2005, the PDD mobilized a sum of

Rs.259 billion through government securities and serviced the

entire public debt portfolio including 605 foreign loans on time.In addition to these main tasks, the PDD handled two key

projects during the year, namely, Sovereign Rating and Debt

Moratorium. The PDD facilitated the process of obtaining aninitial sovereign rating for Sri Lanka by calling and evaluating

proposals from Rating Advisers and selecting Rating Agenciescoordinating with the Lead Manager (Citigroup). The PDD,during the year also facilitated the implementation of debt

moratorium provided by Paris Club members and other bilateral

donors, particularly by coordinating with respective Diplomatic

Missions of the donor countries. During the third quarter of the

year, the PDD made arrangements and coordinated with the

Lead Arranger, Citigroup, to obtain a syndicated loan for thegovernment from international investors amounting to US

dollars 100 million .In the year 2005, the PDD took several initiatives, inparticular, to strengthen the debt management process.

Recognizing the need for implementing a formal domestic debt

management strategy, the PDD took preliminary action toimplement a risk management model with the assistance of

international consultants. The department having identified the

need for a debt consolidation prograrnme to avoid any bunchingproblem of the existing debt portfolio and initiated several

measures. In addition to the existing fixed rate domestic debt

instruments, Indexed Linked Bonds were introduced for the first

time, with a view of ensuring a positive real return to investors

and diversifying debt instruments. Meanwhile, as in the previousyear, the PDD was able to reduce the interest cost of thegovernment on debt by Rs. 3 billion by exercising the early

retirement option of Rupee loans. In addition the PDD, with aview to further facilitating the development of the government

securities market provided Dealer Direct Participant status toColombo Stock Exchange (CSE), commenced the process ofintroducing the Master Agreement on Repo/Reverse repo

tran sacti ons, conducted training/workshop sessi ons for hi maryDealers (PDs) and conducted awareness programmes forinvestors. Stability of the PD system was also further

strengthened by raising the minimum capital requirement and

imposing restrictions on dividend distribution, etc.

15.1 Developments in 2005

(a) Debt Issuance and Cost

The Appropriation Act No l5 of 2004, approved by the

Parliament for the year2005, set the totalgross bonowing limit

of the government in terms of book value, at Rs. 436 billion. Of

this, funds to be raised through domestic sources amounted to

Rs. 331 billion. The PDD mobilized a sum of Rs. 259 billion

throu,eh the government securities programme to meet a part of

the budgetary requirement of the govemment. In addition, gross

bonowings through Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs)

amounted to Rs. 59 billion (US dollars 585 million). The

approved Treasury bill limit for the year remained unchanged at

Rs. 300 billion.

The strategy of raising the required resources for 2005 was

formulated by the Domestic Debt Management Committee(DDMC) comprising members from the Central Bank and theMinistry of Finance, thus effectively coordinating betweenmonetary, fiscal and debt management policies, The debt

management strategy adopted in 2005 aimed at mobilizing the

bulk of the resources from tradable instruments such as Treasury

bonds and Treasury bills and Indexed Linked Bonds. Theseinstruments accounted for 83 per cent of the total funds,mobilized through government securities. There was a net

repayment of Rs. 24 billion in respect of non tradable Rupee

loans, thereby reducing their share in the total domestic debt

stock from 14 per cent in 2004 to I I per cent in 2005. During

the year, there was a strong market appetite for short-term debt

instruments as market participants changed their risk appetite to

a risk aversion position due to their perceptions on market

conditions. Efforts were made to strike a balance between thecost and the risk of the debt portfolio by issuing short term

Treasury bills as well as medium to long term Treasury bonds.

Of the total Treasury bond issues, approximately 6l per cent was

Treasury bonds with more than2 year maturity. In order to

provide some cushion to their expectations on future inflation

rates and to ensure a positive real rate of retum, Indexed Linked

Bonds were introduced to the market in 2005. Meanwhile, in

order to nutigate pressure on the domestic market and to stabilize

the rates, a foreign commercial bonowing (through a syndicated

loan) amounting to US Dollars 100 million with a tenure of 3

years and at arate of LIBOR+95 basis points was obtained

through a Lead Ananger.

In 2005, the PDD conducted 52 Treasury bill auctions and

raised a sum of Rs.486 billion on gross terms through auctions

and placements. However, in net terms, there was a repayment

of Rs. 9,7 billion to the system. Reflecting the market preference

for shorl-termbills, of the totalgross issues,53 percent was 9l-

day Treasury bills. With respect to Treasury Bonds,64 auctions

were conducted and a sum of Rs. 230 billion was raised ttrough

both auctions and direct placements. Due to the market appetite

leaning towards the shorter end of the Treasury bond market,

issues of 4-6 year maturities were limited to Rs.37 billion. The

total number of series of Treasury bonds was further reduced to

56. There was a net repayment for Rupee loans in 2005. This

repayment was mainly through the early retirement of callable

Rupee loans which canied rates of I I to 13 per cent.

Table II - 10 provides details of issues and maturities ofdomestic debt in 2005.

(b) Debt Outstandin_e

Total government debt outstandin-e stood at Rs. 2,717.1 billionby end 2005. In terms of GDP, total debt stock declined to 94per cent from 105.5 per cent in2004 mainly due to appreciationof rupee against the major currencies.

15.2 Debt service payments

Total debt service payments on account of the debt serviced bythe PDD amounted to Rs. 339 billion. Principle repayments ondomestic debt amounted to Rs. 202b1llion. The cost of servicing

the total foreign debt, which amounted to Rs.25 billion recorded

a decline of 43 per cent; i.e. Rs.19 billion, over the previous year.This was due to a decline in both interest cost (by Rs.l0 billion)

and principal repayments (by Rs.17 billion) in view of the debtrelief offered by way of the debt moratorium.

15.3 Debt Moratorium

Considering the devastating effects of the Tsunami, with a viewto allowing Sri Lanka to allocate more resources to addresshumanitarian and reconstruction needs, Paris Club creditors(USA, Canada, Germany, Japan, Italy, Netherlands, Denmark,France) and other bilateral countries such as India and Korea

agreed to defer debt service payments due during the year 2005.The defened repayments would be repaid over a period of fiveyears, which includes a grace period of one year. Accordingly

the repayments will be commenced from December, 2006 andthe moratorium interest accrued in 2005 would be capitalized

and paid as a deferred amount. Outstanding debt due to Italy wasfully written-off while that of China was partly written-off. Inthe meantime, the UK Government agreed to refinance 10 percent of the debt service payments made to the World Bank(IDA). India offered a three year debt moratorium in relation tothe Government of India lines of credit. The totalsavings fromthe debt moratorium amounted to Rs. 27 billion for the year

2005.

15.4 Yield rates of government securities

The yield rates pertaining to government securities, whichstarted to stabilize towards the end of the year 2004, increasedsharply during 2005 in both pnmary and secondary markets. Inline with the changes in the policy rates of the Central Bank and

due to the prevailin-q market conditions, the 9l-day Treasury bill

rate rose by 286 basis points. Parallel to the developments in rhe

short end of the market, there was an upward shift in the upper

end of the yield curve too. In both the primary and the secondarymarkets, yields on allmaturities of Treasury bonds increased. Onan average basis, in the primary market, 2 year and 3 yearTreasury bond yields increased by 152 and 163 basis points,respectively.

opportunity for investors to view their security holdings and

income earning details throu-eh the Internet.

15.6 Supervision of the Primary Dealer(PD) System

The PDD continued to supervise the PDs through off-site

surveillance and by conducting regular on-site examinations of

PD activities, in order to ensure the stability of the PD system.A special on-site examination was conducted durin-e the year of

all PDs to identify the risk management techniques used by each

PD to counter various types of risks. The PDs were advised to

draft and maintain a business continuity plan for their respective

business units in addition to the improvements to their other risk

management tools. One on one discussions and regular PD

meetings were also conducted throughout the year to exchange

views and to take remedial measures in relation to the issues and

concerns which came to light at the on-site examinations.With a view to strengthening the PD system, the minimum

capital requirement of PDs was increased from Rs. 200 million

to Rs. 250 million from July 01, 2005, the details of which arein the Circular No, 08/241002/005/005. It has been decided to

increase their capital requirement further to Rs. 300 million and

L5.7 Developments in Secondary MarketTransactions

During 2005,based on the information compiled through the PDweekly reporting system, where a PD was one party to a

transaction, durin-e 2005, lhe total value of secondary (outright

and Repo) transactions declined by 19.7 per cent from the

previous year. There was a significant decline in the Treasurybond transactions i.e. by 28 per cent, while Treasury bill

transactions recorded an increase of 6 per cent, reflecting the

increased appetite for short term instruments. Total repo and

reverse repo transactions declined by 6 per cent while outri-sht

sales declined by l7 per cent between2004 and 2005.As in the previous year, it was observed that PDs havecontinued to take a position of risk aversion, leadin-{ to an

increase in short-end market transactions such as overnight reposand reverse repos by 20 per cent in the secondary market .

16. Regional Development

The Re,eional Development Department (RDD), as the apex

a-qency of I I development credit schemes sponsored/funded bythe Govemment of Sri Lanka (GOSL) and donor agencies,continued its operations durin-q 2005 fol the further

implementation of the schemes. In addition, in 2005, the RDD

was assigned with the responsibility of implementin-Q three new

credit lines particularly designed for the resumption of business

activities in the Tsunami affected areas, thus bringing the totalnumber of credit schemes implemented by the RDD to 14.

Further, on behalf of the GOSL, the RDD introduced two newCredit Guarantee Schemes to cover a part of the credit riskundertaken by lending banks in granting loans for the

modernization of factories in the apparel sector and for the

resumption of business activities in the Tsunami affected areas.With a view to obtaining funds to implement further credit

schemes to develop and strengthen the construction sector andfacilitate the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Tsunami

affected infrastructure, the RDD parricipated in the negotiations

canied out by the GOSL with the European Investment Bank(EIB) and the French Government.

Among the functions of the RDD in implementing credit

schemes are issuing operating instructions/guidelines toParticipating Financial Institutions (PFIs), disbursement of

refinance or payment of government interest subsidy, recovery

of refinance in respect of the development credit schemes whilemonitoring and supervising of their operations. Further, theRDD is responsible for conducting awareness programmes for

all stakeholders and the general public in collaboration with line

ministries, community based organizations (CBOs) and PFIs,

and the maintenance of data bases/information records and

keepin-e accounts in respect of each credit scheme to facilitate

the relevant functions of the donors and the government.

The projects implemented by the RDD during the year

2005 are given in Table II - 11.During the year under review, in addition to the projects

that were hitherto implemented, the RDD was assi-ened with theresponsibility of implementing the Tsunami Relief Credit

Programme (SUSAHANA) introduced by the Central Bank

under the govemment's livelihood restoration programme in the

Tsunami affected areas. The objective of the loan scheme was

to grant loans on concessional terms towards the commencementof livelihood operations by the affected parties. Initially, Rs.5billion was allocated for the pro-eramme, i.e. Rs.3 billion fromthe Central Bank for disbursement throu-{h formal sector

banking institutions and Rs.2 billion from the ,{overnment for

disbursement through registered finance companies and leasin-u

establishments. As at the end of 2005, under the SUSAHANA

credit scheme, Rs.4,280 million has been disbursed amon,q 9,186

sector banking institutions while 174 enterprises were providedwith Rs.165 million by l5 registered financial companies and

leasing establishments. The disbursement of loans by purpose

as at end December 2005 is -qiven in Table Il- 12.In the latter part of the year, in line wrth the government's

reconstruction and rehabilitation programmes, the Japan Bankfor International Cooperation (JBIC) and United Nations

Development Programme (UNDP) joined the Central Bank toprovide assistance through the banking network for theresumption of micro, small and medium scale enterprises

affected by the Tsunami. Accordingly, the RDD introduced two

separate loan schemes, to supplement the SUSAHANA loan

scheme for the provision of assistance to affected enterprises in

the coastal areas of the country. Two programmes, i.e. Small

Business Revival Programme (SBRP), funded by JBIC, and

Jeevana Sakthi micro frnance scheme operated with a -erant fiom

the UNDP, came into operation in the fourth quarter of the year

2005.The RDD continued the promotion of Forward Sale

Contracts (FSCs) among farmers and buyers, for agricultural

marketing in the country. FSC is an agreement between a buyer

and a farmer to trade agricultural produce on an agreed future

date at a pre determined price. This system, introduced in 1999,

assisted a large number of farmers and buyers to resolve their

marketing difficulties continuously. The RDD promotes this

scheme by coordinating the activities undertaken by differentstakeholders including PFIs, buyers, farmers, farmer

associations and government and non -qoveffrment organizations

throughout the country. Dunng the year under review, the RDD

in association with Regional Offices and PFIs conducted several

awareness programmes with a view to promoting FSCs in the

major agricultural areas of the country. A large share of the local

production of maize, soya bean, sunflower, ginger, -qreen gram,

bee honey and ground nuts was traded under FSCs while

thousands of paddy farmers and other agricultural producersalong with the major buyers were also benefited from this

TABLE 11.12SUSAHANA Loan Scheme - 2005Purpose-wise Disbursements

Purpose

system. In view of the beneficialimpact of FSCs on agriculturalmarkets, particularly durin-e the glut periods, to stabilize

commodity prices, the Central Bank with the concunence of thegovernment increased the uppel limit of purchasing loans

granted in connection with FSCs, from Rs.25 million to Rs.50million per borrower, durin-e the year 2005.The RDD, in collaboration with Regional Offices inAnuradhapura, Matale and Matara, continued its efforts toimprove a-ericultural productivity through the introduction ofnew hybrid seed varieties, farm equipment, post harvesting

methods, micro inigation technologies and new crops whichcould -qenerate higher income for farmers. A remarkable

progress both in relation to productivity and farmers' income

levels has been observed in respect of the cultivation of maize,ginger and sunflower during the year under review. The RDD

conducted several preparatory meetings during the year underreview with input suppliers, seed importers, seed producers,

exporters, agricultural commodity buyers and PFIs in order tocoordinate the programme on productivity improvement"Forward Sales Contracts and productivity improvement

programmes were promoted through the expansion of the New

Comprehensive Rural Credit Schemes (NCRCS) which offer

support by way of an the interest subsidy from the government.During the two cultivation seasons in2004105 Maha and 2005

Yala, a total sum of Rs.4.03 billion has been disbursed by PFIsfor 66,953 farmers and 1,269 buyers under the NCRCS.

The RDD continued to monitor the performance of the six

Regional Development Banks (RDBs) with a view to ensuringtheir long run financial viability. All RDBs achieved a

remarkable improvement in all financial ratios and recordedprofits exceeding their budgetary targets during the year 2005.

In order to facilitate the RDB restructuring prografirme under the

Rural Financial SectorDevelopment hoject (RFSDP), all sharesand debentures held by the Central Bank in RDBs were

transfened to the GOSL in June 2005. Accordingly, l6 million

shares in six RDBs amountins to Rs.160 million at a nominal

economic issues, throu-qhout the year. Many staff members

participated in trainin-q programmes and workshops to further

their knowled,{e and skills dunng the year towards improving thequality and productivity of the Department.

19.1. Consumer Finances and SocioEconomic Survey (CFS) 2003104

The year marked the completion of the periodic project of the

Department, the CFS 2003104. This was the 8'r' in the series of

multi-purpose household surveys that corrmenced in 1953. Amajor achievement of this survey was its coverage of the

household population in the Eastem province and most of theNofthern province, excluding only Kilinochchi, Mannar andMulaitivu Districts.

The CFS Report 2003104 was disseminated in two parts.Part I of the Report contains an overview and analysis of the

findings of the survey covering the seven areas of demography:education and health; labour force; housing and living

conditions; income; consumption and expenditure; and savings,

investment and bonowings of households. Part I of the Report

also provides a comparison with the findings of the previousCFS 1996/97 . Part 2 of the Report provides detailed tabulatedinformation under the seven main areas covered in Part I of theReport, disaggregated by province and sector (urban, tural,

estate). As a more wide-spread dissemination strategy, the

Department published sunimary reports in Sinhala and Tamil onthe key findings from the CFS 2003/04, which were also

launched with Part I and Part 2 of the Repoft in September 2005.In addition, the Department has made the micro data from the

CFS 2003/04 and the CFS 1996/97 available on CD to potential

users for research purposes. Cost recovering tkough sales of thereports and micro data of around Rs. 1.5 million had been

achieved by March 2006.

19.2 Countrywide Data Collection System(cwDCS)

Collection of data on prices and wages under the CWDCS,

analysis of collected information and dissemination of results

were continued. With the expansion of the CWDCS to market

centres in the Northem and Eastem Provinces (NEP) in2004,

the Department collected data from 107 CWDCS centres during

2005. With respect to updating data, along with the introductionof new formats for data collection, the supervision of teacherinvestigators was also strengthened to ensure quality and

timeliness of information in accordance with the annual time

table set at the beginning of the year. Off-site as well as on-sitefield supervision was conducted in respect of all centres outside

the NEP, while off-site supervision was conducted in respect of

all 7 centres established in the NEP. As in the past, four regional

seminars, in Colombo, Matara, Anuradhapura and Kandy, wereconducted to provide refresher training to the teacher

investigators to improve the accuracy, quality, efficiency and

timeliness of their data collection and also to educate them oncontemporary developments in the economy, so that suchknowled-ee could be transferred to their students andcommunities. The effectiveness of such pro-qrammes was

reflected in improved awareness and interest in economic issues

among the teacher investigators. The preliminary work to

rationalise data collection centres under the CWDCS was also

completed during the year.

L9.3 National and Regional IncomeAccounts

The Department continued to compile and disseminate annual

and quarterly estimates of Sri Lanka's national accounts withfurther improvements. Estimates of Private Consumption

Expenditure (PCE) were improved using information from the

CFS 2003/04, A system to extract and incorporate information

available from the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) database

in the national accounts compilation was also developed in 2005following the initial work undertaken in the previous year. Also,

the performance of companies listed on the Colombo Stock

Exchange (CSE) was studied with a view to evaluating their

contribution to overall economic activity and Gross Domestic

Product (GDP). The presentation of information on GDP was

improved through the reclassification of the annual and quarterly

GDP estimates in line with the International Standard Industrial

Classification (ISIC). The work initiated in 2003 to build adata

series on quarterly national accounts computed on the basis of

the expenditure method continued through 2005 as well.As in the previous years, the Department compiled and

disseminated data on the annual GDP disaggregated by hovince

(PGDP), with a lag of one year, for 20A4. The Departmentnoted

that the PGDP data series have now entered mainstream policydiscussions aimed at identifying and addressing regional

disparities in economic activities and the growth performance of

the country.

19.4 Prices, Wages and Employment

The Department compiled and analysed six monthly price

indices. While the five regional consumer price indices measure

the aggregate price movements in retail prices in five differentregions, the Wholesale Price Index measures the same for

producer or wholesale prices. The prices necessary for thecompilation of all indices were either collected through the

CWDCS or by investigators to whom data collection had been

outsourced but were trained by the Department. Under the

outsourced data collection system, information was collectedfrom 7 market centres in the Colombo District and 3 reeional

economtc centres.

In addition, the Department continued with the analysis ofmovements of consumer prices based on the Colombo

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - zOOs( xxxvll )

Part llAccounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Consumers' Price Index (CCPI) and the Sri Lanka Consumers'hice Index (SLCPI), which are compiled by the Department of

Census and Statistics (DCS). The Department continued to issue

a monthly media release on inflation movements as measured by

the CCPI and the CDCPL Development of the Informal Sector

Wage Rate Index (ISWRI) continued, with a focus on improving

the quality and the coverage of the data on informal sector

wages. A project to compile CPIs for all nine provinces usinginformation on consumer expenditure from the CFS 2003/04

was initiated in 2005.The Department continued to conduct its Annual and

Quarterly Public Sector Employment Surveys. Information fromboth surveys was used in the compilation of the national

accounts and in quarterly reports. A quarterly labour market

review was initiated by extending the coverage of the quarterly

report to the areas of foreign employment, labour relations andlabour market reforms, in addition to the annual and half yearly

analysis of the labour force and the Iabour market.

19.5 Dissemination of Statistics

During the year, the Department released its two annualpublications titled " Socio Economic Data 2005" (volumeXXVIII) and "Economic and Social Statistics of Sri Lanka

2005" (Volume XXVII) in June and Novemberrespectively, in

addition to the four CFS 2003/04 publications that were releasedin September. The statistical tables in the Central Bank pocket

diary 2006 were also updated, while new tables were introduced

in allpublications to provide preliminary statistics from the CFS20031M to users.

The Department made its regular contributions to statutory,

as well as other CentralBank publications, during the year. TheMonetary Board was kept informed of the current key findingswith regard to national accounts, inflation, prices, wages and thelabour market, on quarterly and annual bases. The Departmentcontinued to routinely update its Departmental website on thelocal area network, Sta-Net, and to contribute to the Bank'swebsite tluoughout the year,

19.6 Contributions to Public AwarenessProgrammes of the Central Bank

The Department's senior staff regularly functioned as resourcepersons at seminars, workshops, training sessions and mediadiscussions organised by the Central Bank, the government,

private organisations, educational institutions and the media. TheDepartment continued to provide in-house industnal training totwo undergraduates from the Statistics Department of theUruversity of Colombo and to support the graduate development

pro-qramme at the University of Moratuwa in 2005, as well.

20. Supervision of Non-BankFinancial Institutions

The Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial

Institutions (SNBFI Dept.) continued to cany out regulation and

supervision of registered finance companies (RFCs) to ensure

that RFCs comply with the prudential requirements stipulated by

the Central Bank. The Department also performed the tasks ofregistering, regulating and monitoring of registered finance

leasing establishments (RFLEs).

During the year, one new finance company was registered

increasing the total number of RFCs to 28 by end 2005, and tlree

leasing companies were registered, increasing the total number

of RFLEs to 6$as at the same date.

20.1 Registered Finance Companies

(a) Off-Site SurveillanceIn the process of canying out off-site surveillance of RFCs,

periodical returns submrtted by RFCs were analysed with a view

to ascertaining the financial condition of RFCs and monitoring

their compliance with the Directions and Rules issued under the

Finance Companies Act No. 78 of 1988 (FCA).Directions issued under the FCA covered, inter alia,minimum capital and liquidity requirements, provisioning for

bad and doubtful debts, single borrower limits, and limits on

equity investments.

In general, RFCs complied with the prudential Directions

on a continuous basis, although there have been occasional non-

compliances by a few. Such non-compliant RFCs were given

specific time frames to rectify the violations and the Department

closely followed up the corrective action taken by them.

(b) On -site Examinations

The Department conduc ted comprehensive on-site examinations

of four RFCs during the year in order to assess capital adequacy,

asset quality, management efficiency, earnings, Iiquidity,internal controls and systems, and compliance with statutory

requirements. Spot examinations were conducted in respect of

the other twenty four RFCs. These spot examinations covered

selected critical areas such as non-compliance with Directions

and deficiencies in systems and controls.

Findin-es of the on-site examinations were discussed withthe Boards of Directors of the respective RFCs and theDepartment insisted on taking ur-qent corrective action to

eliminate deficiencies. Prompt corrective action has been taken

wherever possible and firm commitments were given by the

Boards of Directors for conectin-e any remaining deficiencies.

(a) Registration of finance leasing establishments

In terms of the FLA, the registration under the Act is necessaryto conduct finance leasing business. During the year, 3institutions comprising one LCB and two public companieswhich are refened to as specialized leasing companies (SLCs),

were registered under the provisions of the FLA. At the end of2005, the total number of RFLEs stood at 6$comprising l3LCBs, 7 LSBs, 28 RFCs and 10 SLCs.(b) Monitoring of SLCs

In August 2003, a Direction was issued by the Director SNBFI

Department to obtain vital information on a regular basis from

SLCs. Since then the Deparlment has been closely monitoringthe affairs of SLCs. Having considered the business

characteristics of RFLEs and the already existing regulatory

arrangements for LCBs, LSBs and RFCs, the Department issued

the following Directions to SLCs to promote soundness of their

operations and stability.(i) Finance kasing (Minimum Capital) Direction No. I of

2005(vi) Finance Leasing (Reserve Fund) Direction No. 6 of 2005.

These Directions became effective from 2 January 2006.

The Department also initiated action to compile statistics

relating to the finance leasing business of LCBs, LSBs and

RFCs on quarterly basis.

20.3 Failed Finance Companies

Nine failed finance companies had been vested with the

Monetary Board since 1988 under the provisions of the FCA.

Six of those had been under liquidation at the beginning of 2005.During 2005, two were wound up and the liquidation process

continued in the case of the other four companies,Of the remaining three companies, two were handed over

to the liquidators during 2005. The other company, which was

able to recover some dues from a related company, commenced

another round of partial refund of deposits and also repaid a part

of the principal of the loans obtained from the Central Bank.

20.4 Unauthorized Conduct of FinanceBusiness

The Department continued investigations into affairs of the

institutions, which were allegedly engaged in finance businesswithout legal authority. In respect of eleven such institutions,

the Monetary Board, on consideration of the reports submitted

by the Department, made determinations under section I l(2) ofthe FCA that they were conducting finance business in

contravention of the provisions of the FCA. This was followed

by taking appropriate action under the provisions of the FCA

against those institutions.During the year, the Department initiated legal action

against one company, which failed to comply with the Directions

issued by the Monetary Board after determining that that

company had been conducting finance business without legalauthority. As at the end of 2005, the Central Bank had taken

legal action against 6 institutions for offences committed under

the FCA.In March 2005, the Supreme Court refused to grant leave

to two companies to appeal against ajudgement delivered by theCourt of Appeal on 22.09.2004. The respondents of the

Supreme Court case were the Director, SNBFI Dept. (D/SNBFI)

and the Monetary Board. The judgement of the Court of Appeal

had emphasized the powers conferred on D/SNBFI for requiring

information from the two companies to ascertain whether they

were engaged in finance business as defined in the FCA.

There has been a marked decline in the number of inquirieV

complaints received in respect of persons conducting finance

business in an unauthorised manner. This may be pafily due to

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2005( xxxx )

Part tlAccounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

the action taken by the Central Bank on a continuous basisregarding such persons and the intensified public awarenessprogramme.

20.5 Public Awareness Programme

matters relatin,e to the unauthonzed conduct of finance business.The public awareness programme implemented by theDepartment included the following:-(a) Publications in Newspapers: -(i) A list of registered finance companies (January

leave to proceed to two companies, which appealed

against a judgement of the Court of Appeal objectingon several grounds to requiring information anddocuments by D/SNBFI from them for aninvestigation conducted under section 1l(l) of theFCA (March 2005).(iv) Names and addresses of 4 companies in respect ofwhich the Monetary Board had made determinationsunder section ll(2) of the FCA (May, September,October and November 2005).(v) A notice indicating the names and addresses of l0institutions in respect of which the Monetary Boardhad made determinations up to November 2005,under section 11(2) of the FCA (November 2005).(vi) A notice under the caption "Be mindful of where youplace your savings" indicating the risks associated
