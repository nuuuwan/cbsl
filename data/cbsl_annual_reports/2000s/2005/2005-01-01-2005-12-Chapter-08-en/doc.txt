FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND STABILITY

8.1 Overview

The flrnancial sector expanded and remained resilient in

2005 overcoming the shocks, which impacted on the

economy, bolstering economic development. Financial

institutions reported improved performance, both in terms ofprofits and soundness during 2005. Their anay of financial

products and services broadened. Access to finance was further

enhanced with financial institutions offering new facilities, and

with the setting up of a new institution catering especially to

small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs). Activities infinancial markets surged to record high levels. This wasparticularly so in the foreign exchange and share markets,

which benefited from economic and political stability and real

sector growth. Financial sector infrastructure was further

improved with measures being taken to increase efficiency of

the payment and settlement systems, the introduction of new

legislation to facilitate the smooth functioning of the financial

system and improvements made to the regulatory and

supervisory framework in line with international best practices.

During 2005, several measures were taken by the Central

Bank to further improve the efficiency and strength of thepayment and settlement systems. The Payment andSettlement Systems Act No. 28, which was enacted in

September 2005, provides for the Central Bank to oversee the

payment and settlement systems and money service providers

and to facilitate the electronic presentment of cheques. The

operations of the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system

and the Scripless Securities Settlement (SSS) system, were

expanded and efficiency enhanced through wider access and

improvements to these systems. Preparatory work for theintroduction of the Cheque Imaging and Truncation (CIT)

system was completed and it is to be operational in euly 2006.

The CIT system will improve the processing of retail and low-

value payments effected primarily throu-eh cheques by reducing

the cheque realization times throu-ehout the country thus

benefiting the general public.

The regulatory and legal framework was further improved

with measures introduced to stren$hen both bank and non'

bank institutions. The Central Bank continued its efforts in

preparing banks for the adoption of Basel II, which is scheduled

to be in place by 2008, which willhelp better manage the risks

faced by financial institutions. The fit and proper criteria for

selecting boards of directors of financial institutions were

further strengthened. Financial institutions were requested to

enhance capital, and new regulations have been issued in

relation to the sin-ele bonower limit, related party transactions

and disclosure of information. The CentralBank continued its

public awareness campaign aimed at educating the public on therisks of investing in unregulated and fraudulent financial

institutions. A number of statutes relating to the financial sector

were amended to improve the eff,rciency of the financial sectorwhile promoting high standards of risk management and

stability.a Financial system stability was further strengthened in 2005

as reflected by the improvements in key performanceindicators of systemically important financial institutionsand the payment and settlement system, though some

downside risks exist. The impact of exogenous shocks have

not dissipated fully yet. The rising oil prices could furtherwiden the current account deficit. Achieving fiscalconsolidation is critical in strengthening macroeconomic

stability and hence supporting financial system stability. The

growth in credit to the private sector is stillhigh and this has thepotential to impair credit quality. Nevertheless, continuousstrengthening of the legal and regulatory framework,

enhancement of capital of financial institutions, improved risk

management practices, efforts of the govemment aimed at fiscal

consolidation, and continued market discipline would helpmitigate and manage risks. A further measure taken towardsthis end is the publication of the Financial Stability Report bythe Central Bank.. The resolution of several important issues in relation to thecost of intermediation, the supervision of conglomeratesand improved corporate governance may further enhancethe resilience and stability of the financial system. Theintermediation cost of banks represented by the interest spreadhas declined in the recent past, but still remains high relativeto regional standards. Efforts need to be made by banks toimprove efficiency and increase productivity to lower highoperationalcosts which raise the intermediation cost. Recentissues relating to the concentration of share ownership offinancial institutions, which undermine public and investorconfidence, underscore the necessity of strengthening corporategovemance in financial institutions. This has been visible in thecross shareholdings in financial conglomerates and theresulting conflicts of interest. The Central Bank has alreadytaken initiatives to enhance corporate governance through thestrict enforcement of the Banking Act, the imposition of marketdiscipline and through greater disclosure.

8.2 Developments in Financial Institutions. Financial institutions expanded and improved further in2005, enhancing the capacity and the capability of thefinancial sector to effectively support the financial needs ofthe economy. The number of insurance and leasing institutionsincreased. Although the number of banks increased with theestablishment of a government owned specialized bank, theSME Bank, the number of banks at the end of the year remainedunchanged as a result of the merger of a licensed specialisedbank with a licensed commercialbank. Total assets of frnancialinstitutions increased by l4 per cent mainly due to the sustainedexpansion in credit operations. Licensed commercial banks(LCBs) and licensed specialised banks (l-SBs) hold a dominantposition in the financial sector contributing about 56 per centof the financial assets. Within the banking sector, LCBscontinued to be the largest mobiliser of deposits. Notabledevelopments in the banking sector were the measures taken toenhance the capital requirements and the preparatory workundertaken towards implementing the Basle II capital accordin 2008, which will help strengthen the risk managementpractices and the efficiency of the banking sector.

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka

The total assets of the Central Bank increased by 6.4 percent in 2005 with a sharp increase in its net foreign assets(NFA). Net domestic assets (NDA) of the Central Bankdeclined following the sterilisation of the liquidity created bythe increase in NFA through a-egressive Open MarketOperations (OMOs)

The country experienced significant amounts of foreigninflows of funds through grants, loans, debt relief andremittances, which led to an overall improvement in the

NFA and resulted in a BOP surplus. The sale of foreigncurrency proceeds received by the government in the form ofgrants and loans from foreign sources and foreign currencyborrowin-es from domestic foreign currency banking units, tothe Central Bank led to the increase in NFA and consequentlyan increase in rupee liquidity in the market. The excessliquidity was absorbed through OMOs, leading to a decline inTreasury bill holdings of the Central Bank and a conespondingdecline in NDA.r On the liability side, the total currency issue of the CentralBank increased by 14 per cent (Rs. 16.5 billion) reflectingthe increased demand for currency for transactions. Thedeposits of commercial banks held by the Central Bank forstatutory reserve purposes increased by l9 per cent (Rs. l0billion) along with the growrh in deposit Iiabilities ofcommercial banks.

range and improving service quality. The LCBs, numberin_{22, expanded their services, through a network of 1,405

branches, and [,695 other service outlets. Bankin_e density, i.e.,the number of bank branches per hundred thousand persons,improved from 7.1 in 2004 to 7.2 in 2005, improvin_e theaccessibility of banking services in the country. The totalnumber of automated teller machines and electronic fund

transfer facilities at the point of sae (EF-IPOS) increased to 901

and 7,013 in 2005 from 810 and6,542, respectively, in 2004.A number of banks expanded their range of banking products,especially technology-based delivery products such as phonebanking, e-banking, and credit cards. While some of theseproducts had added features, banks also introduced new deposit

schemes and loan schemes.s As commercial banking operations expanded and theirfinancial strength improved, measures were taken toimprove bank surveillance through enhanced prudentialregulations and corporate governance. Improvements were

made to the disclosure requirements to enhance transparency ofbanks. Banks were required to disclose their key financialperformance indicators, including non-performing loans(NPLs) and capital adequacy, to foster market discipline. Those

measures are expected to make banks more conscious of the

need to better manage their risks. Commercial banks also took

several initiatives in this regard, especially in the areas of credit

and operational risks. A number of banks had strengthened

their bad loan recoveries and introduced credit scoring methods

to retail customers. All banks had obtained credit ratings under

the mandatory ratin_e introduced in20M, though the ratings of

a few banks are yet to be published.

Developments in the Structure of Licensed CommercialBanks: The total assets of LCBs increased further by 22percent in 2005 compared to the 17 per cent growth in 2004.This growth was propelled by the sustained expansion ineconomic activity and the robust demand for credit fromcorporate and household sectors. Within the banking sector,the highest growth of 36 per cent in assets was recorded inforeign banks, which was partly a result of the additionalcapitalbrought in to augment their asset base. This contributed toincreasing the share of foreign banks' assets in total assets aswell. Assets of domestic private banks, which recorded the next

highest growth in terms of assets, rose by 23 per cent, increasingtheir share in total assets and competition in the banking sector.Accordingly, the share of the state banks in total assets declinedfurther.

The major share of loans has been granted by domesticprivate banks followed by the state banks. With theirincreased resources, the highest growth in credit to the private

sector was recorded in foreign banks, though they contributedonly 14 per cent of overall credit. The next highest growth was

. Table 8.4

Credit Card Operations by Commercial Bankssecurities and loans to the government accounted for about 24

per cent of the increase in resources. About 7 per cent of the

increase in resources was maintained in the form of foreign

balances. In 2005, commercial bank reserves with the Central

Bank increased by about Rs.l5 billion, reflecting the increasein deposit Iiabilities of commercial banks.

Lending to the private sector continued to be mainly forexternal and domestic trading, housing, agriculture,industry, flinancing, tourism and consumption. Credit for

trading,which absorbed the largest share of credit (35 per cent),grew by 15 per cent in 2005. Credit for consumption and

housing purposes, both of which grew at a higher rate of around32per cent during the year, contributed 17 per cent and 15 per

cent, respectively, to the total growth in credit. Within the

consumption category, the outstanding credit in respect of credit

cards grew by 35 per cent and stood at Rs. 15 billion along with

an increase in the number of active credit cards. Reflecting therelatively low real interest rates charged on loans comparedwith overdrafts, loans grew at 2L.7 per cent compared with thegrowth in overdrafts of 7.6 per cent.

The overall exposure of commercial banks to the public

sector increased entirely as a result of an increase in creditprovided to the government. Commercial banks'credit topublic corporations declined. Net credit to the government(NCG) increased by about Rs.60 billion, which consisted

mainly of FCBU loans extended to the govemment, an increasein Treasury bond holdings and overdrafts to the government.Meanwhile, government deposits with commercial banks

increased by Rs.7 billion in 2005. Even though the NCG from

commercial banks increased sharply, NCG from the overall

banking system increased only by Rs.26 billion in 2005 as NCG

from the Central Bank declined by Rs.33 billion entirely due to

a decline in Treasury bill holdings. Credit to public

corporations from commercial banks declined by about Rs.24billion, helping to contain the commercial banks' exposure to

the public sector.Key Performance Indicators: All key performanceindicators of commercial banks improved in 2005. This

indicated improved resilience of the LCBs. The profitability

of LCBs increased with pre-tax profits increasing by 42 per cent

due to a higher increase in net interest income, whereas non-

interest income declined over the previous year due mainly to

a reduction in foreign exchange income. Itofitability in termsof ROA and ROE also increased. The asset quality of LCBs

improved as reflected by the further decline in NPLs. This

improvement was a net result of an expansion in lending

portfolios, strong recoveries and some banks writing off baddebts. Liquidity in the banking system too remained at a

comfortable level mainly due to improved liquidity in the

money market as a result of the higher foreign inflows. The

capital adequacy ratio improved and was above the minimum

regulatory standard of l0 per cent of risk wei-ehted assets with

the further capital injections made by some banks to meet

seen in credit extended by domestic private banks thatcontributed the largest share of 48 per cent of the total credit

extended by LCBs. Credit growth of state banks was 17 per

cent, contributing 38 per cent of the total credit.o The profitability of both domestic private banks and state

banks increased.In contrast, the profitability of foreign banks

declined in 2005, reducing their Return on Assets (ROA) and

eturn on Equity (ROE). The decline in profitability ratios was

mainly due to the additional capital brought in in 2005 and the

reduction in foreign exchange income with the appreciation of

the rupee against the US dollar.e Sources and Uses of Funds of LCBs: The resource base ofthe LCBs consisting of deposits, capital funds andborrowings, recorded a healthy growth during the year.

The deposits consisting of both rupee and foreign currency

deposits, increased further contributing 63 per cent of the total

resources mobilised in 2005. Within the rupee deposits, non-

interest bearing demand deposits, which contribute l4 per centof the total deposits, grew by 31 per cent, while time and

savings deposits which contribute 86 per cent grew by 17 per

cent, The higher growth in deposits is partly a reflection of thehigher disposable income of households following the

continued expansion in economic activiry. The foreign curency

deposits, which grew by 13 per cent contributed 20 per cent of

the total deposits mobilised. Total deposits grew by 19 per centin 2005.c The contribution from capital and reserves to the totalgrowth of funds was 10 per cent, compared with the 1.2 per

cent growth in 2004. This is a reflection of the measures taken

by banks to increase capital in response to the higher capital

requirement imposed by the Central Bank. Bonowings, which

include rupee and foreign borrowings by commercial banks

increased by 25 per cent and contributed 5 per cent of the total

resources mobilised.. The bulk of the resources mobilised by LCBs in 2005'amounting to Rs. 252 billion was utilised mainly for the

expansion of lending and investment activities. Of the total

resources mobilised, about 47 pr cent was accounted for by the

increases in loans and advances, given the strong demand for

loans from the private sector. Investment in government

enhanced prudential regulations. Furthermore, the provisionsfor non-performing loans too remained at comfortable levels,

strengthening the resilience of the banking sector.

Although the interest spread, defined as the differencebetween the average interest yield oninterest earning assets

and the average interest cost on interest bearing liabilities,declined in 2005, it is still high compared to regionalstandards. A gradual decline in the interest spread was

observed during this year as well, mainly due to the increase indeposit rates. However, a further decline could be expected

when the banking system (i) improves its operational efficiency,(ii) enhances risk management and (iii) takes measures to

expand fee-based income to reduce dependence on net interest

lncome.Restructuring of State Banks: The strategic plansformulated by the state banls under the guidance of theStrategic Enterprise Management Agency (SEMA) wereimplemented further.

Bank of Ceylon (BOC): The bank was able to achieve itstargets in the specified areas such as branch automation,capital enhancement, management information systemsand human resource development during the year. In termsof the strategic plans formulated inZN4, the Bank was given

benchmark targets in the areas of asset reconstruction, systemsupgrading, human resource development and capitalaugmentation through internal generation of funds, to be

achieved within a two-year period. With regard to automation,the BOC expanded the number of branches linked on-line to

165, enhancing its ability to provide efficient and high qualityservices, in a highly competitive banking industry and

cornmensurate with its position as the market leader.

G People's Bank (PB): Under the business restructuring plan(BRP), PB has made commendable progress by posting apositive net worth of approximately Rs.4 billion, wipingout its negative net worth of approximately Rs. 6 billionreported in 2ffi1. The five-year BRP, formulated by the Bank

under the superuision of SEMA, envisages an infusion of Rs.

8.5 billion through an ADB line of credit of US dollars 65million to the government during this period. The success of the

plan is linked to the achievement of benchmark targets in termsof staff, productivity, asset reconstruction and credit riskmanagement, which are aimed at ensuring PB's long termviability and competitiveness. In Decemb er 2005, PB received

a capital infusion of Rs. 2.0 billion under the above plan,

consequent to its meeting some of the benchmark targets set.Action is being initiated to establish a separate division for the

transfer and management of NPLs of the bank. The NPL ratio

has improved from 14 per cent to I I per cent in 2005. Forty

branches were fully automated under the Core Banking systemintroduced in 2005.

Licensed Specialised Banksr Amongst licensed specialised banks (LSBs) are diversebanking institutions, which include development banks,savings banks and regional development banks (RDBs).

The total assets and profits of the LSBs (excluding the NDB)

grew by l3 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively. Excluding the

the NDB, the deposits of LSBs still showed an increase of 6 per

cent since NDB was not dependent on deposits. The NationalDevelopment Bank of Sri Lanka (NDB) was converted to acommercial bank after the merger with the NDB Bank in

August 2005. Consequent to the merger, the asset share of LSBsin the financial sector declined from about t3 per cent in 2004

An Update on the Regional Comparison

Annual Report 2004 presented a regional comparison ofinterest spread and interest margin in Box Article 2,

demonstrating that the intermediation cost in Sri Lanka in2003 was the highest in the region mostly due to highoperational costs in the domestic banking system.r Updated

data with information for 2004 show that the margin hasdeclined somewhat in Sri Lanka, but still it is the highest in

the region. However, the decline may not be sustained unlessthe banking system improves the operational efficiency,

enhances risk management and expands fee-based income

sources to reduce dependence on net interest income.

remained at 14 due to the entry of the SME bank during the

year. The branch network of LSBs contracted to 369 in 2005,with the exit of rhe NDB.a Lending by the LSBs was concentrated in the housing,industrial and financial sectors. These three sectors

accounted for 69 per cent of the loans approved during theyear. The housing sector has received the highest share of loans

since several LSBs, namely, State Mortgage and Investment

Bank (SMIB), HDFC Bank, and NationalSavings Bank (NSB)

cater mainly to this sector. However, the composition of assetsof LSBs differs significantly from that of LCBs, with

investments in government securities accounting for about 53

per cent of the total assets in comparison to the 25 per cent sharein LCBs. Profits of LSBs declined, when compared to 2004,in view of the capital losses incuned due to the rise in interest

rates. The total outstanding loans and deposits of LSBs at end

Meanwhile, the total profits of the sector decreased to Rs. 6.6billion from Rs. 7.9 billion in2004.

Paft |chapter 8 - FINANCTAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND STABILITY

Registered Finance Companiess Registered Finance Companies (RFCs) recorded a healthyperformance in 2005, with increases in their lending anddeposit activities, an expansion in their branch network

and an improvement in their financialsoundness. With a

view to broadbasing the financial resources available to RFCs

and providing an altrernative avenue to savers, the RFCs were

permitted to accept savings deposits from the public in 2005

subject to the prudential requirements stipulated by the Central

Bank.c Total assets of RCFs grew by about 32 per cent in 2005 in

comparison to the 23 per cent growth in 2()04. Although the

share of total assets of RFCs is relatively small, the sharp

increase in their assets indicates that RFCs are an importantfinancial service provider to a segment of the population,

specially those who have different risk profiles. There were 28

RFCs operating in Sri Lanka by end 2005. They concentrated

their business activities mainly in leasing, hire purchase and

real estate activities.s Of the main areas of business of RFCs, namely hirepurchase, leasing and real estate development, hirepurchase showed a significant expansion due to the absence

of VAT on second hand vehicles that were funded through hire

purchase. Loans and advances granted by RFCs increased by

about 34per cent as against the growth of 25 per cent in 2004.

Hire purchase and leasing activities accounted for about 50 per

cent of the total assets and about 70 per cent of the total loans

and advances portfolio of RFCs in 2005. Although realestate

development activities of RFCs have increased at a higher rate,

the growth has decelerated to a certain extent over the previous

year in a risin-{ interest rate environment.s Deposits continued to be the main source of funds for

RFCs, in addition to capital funds and bank borrowings.

Deposits which accounted for about 65 per cent of the totalexternal funds of RFCs, grew by about 23 per cent (Rs. 9billion) in 2005 compared to the l4 per cent (Rs. 5 billion)growth recorded in the previous year, The higher deposit rates

offered by RFCs relative to banks may have contributed to thisincrease in deposits. Even though RFCs were permitted to

accept savin-es deposits from the public from February 2005,

the savings deposits mobilised by them have yet to expand. In

contrast, their bonowings from banks increased si-qnificantly

by around I 10 per cent in 2005. These accounted for about 17

per cent of the total sources offunds obtained from all sources.

Capital funds of RFCs -erew by around 43 per cent due mainly

to the increase in reserves through the retention of profits, andwere l8 per cent of the sources of funds obtained from all

sources in 2005.

Other Financial Institutions

@ Primary Dealers (PDs): The rise in market interest rates

adversely affected primary dealers, resulting in a decline in

their profits, asets and capital levels. In order to reduce therevaluation losses arising from marking to market in thecontext of rising interest rates, PDs reduced their trading

portfolios in ,eovernment securities and increased their reverserepo positions, However, their total assets declined fromRs.6l.6 billion at end 2004 to Rs. 45.5 billion ar end 2005.With the withdrawalof one bank PD in June 2005, the numberof PDs operating in the market declined by one to eleven.

Although the total assets and total investment portfolios of

PDs declined as a result of asset revaluation losses, theirfinancial position remained at a satisfactory level. The

capital base of the industry decreased by Rs. 376 million to Rs.

4.3 billion in 2005 due to capital losses and the exit of one PD.

However, all the PDs maintained capital adequacy ratios abovethe minimum level of 5 per cent of total assests, The capital

leverage of the industry declined to 8.5 times compared to L2.I

times in 2004.1n2005, the ROA and ROE of the industry were

0.6 per cent and 7 .3 per cent, respectively, compared to I . 1 and

14.7 per cent in 2004. The total portfolio of the PD industry

decreased from Rs. 56 billion at end 2004 to Rs. 45 billion atend 2005. A portfolio concentration towards short-term

instruments such as repos was seen in the light of rising interest

rates.

The Central Bank took measures to improve the financialstrength of PDs during the year. These includedenhancement of the minimum capital requirement,

strengthening of the special risk reserve and restrictions on

dividend distribution to mitigate risks. The minimum capitalof PDs was increased on I July 2005 to Rs 250 million from

Rs. 200 million. This minimum requirement would be further

increased to Rs. 300 million from I July 2006 along with the

introduction of a risk weighted capital adequacy framework.Further, the Central Bank caried out stress tests on a monthly

basis to evaluate the market risk exposure of the PDs. With aview to popularising government securities among the

investors and to increase awareness, the PDs and the CentralBank continued to hold investor awareness pro-erams in

different parts of the country,

Specialised Leasing Companies (SLCs): Improvedcorporate performance and competitive financing

packages offered to customers led to a further expansion

of leasing activity. By end 2005,68 financial institutions i,e,,

20 SLCs, 13 LCBs, 7 LSBs, and28 RFCs had been registeredwith the Central Bank to carry on leasing business. The tota-

assets of SLCs grew by 32per cent to Rs. 63 billion, while thetotal leases outstanding increased to Rs. 38 billion in 2005from Rs. 3l billion Ln2004. The total leases granted by all

re,eistered finance leasin-{ establishments increased to Rs. 98billion in 2005 from Rs. 80 billion in2004.

Passenger and commercial vehicles were the main

categories which absorbed the bulk of finance leases withthe continued growth in the trade and transportation

sectors. A major share (70 per cent) of the finance leases

granted were on account of passenger and commercial vehicles.Anothel area in which leasin_e is increasingly being used as a

source of funds is office equipment which accounted for l6 per

cent ofleases granted in 2005.

Having considered the existing regulatory arrangements inrespect of other categories of registered finance leasin,e

establishments with a view to promoting sound operations andstability of SLCs, a set of prudential norms covering minimumcapital, provision for bad and doubtful debts, single borrowerlimit, gearing ratio, accrued interest and maintenance of a

reserue fund were issued in December 2005,

Merchant Banks: The merchant banking sector continuedto expand supported by a significant increase in fund basedactivities. Leasing, investments in financial instruments andlending activities have become the main lines of business for

merchant banks, due to the lack of opportunities in the equity

and debt markets for investment banking activites. The totalincome of the industry increased by 14 per cent, from Rs. 2lbillion to Rs. 24 billion. There were l0 merchant banks inoperation by end 2005.

Unit Trusts: The unit trust industry performed well in thebackdrop of the upturn in the Colombo bourse. The total

assets of the industry increased by 8.7 per cent to Rs. 4.5.billion, which represents about one per cent of the total assetsof the financial system. The total number of funds, managedby five institutions, as well as the types of funds (growth,income, balanced, indexed and money market) remained

unchanged at 13 and 5 respectively. During the year, two funds

managedby the Vanik Asset Management Co. Ltd. were boughtover by Ceylon Investment Management Co. Ltd.

Supported by the appreciation of the equity portfolio, thenet asset value ofthe industry increased by about 8 per centto Rs. 4.5 billion at end 2005. Consequently, the net asset

value per unit increased by about 9 per cent from Rs. L2.20 in2004 to Rs. 13.39 in 2005. This was reflected in theconesponding increase in the average buying and selling pricesby about one per cent to Rs. 14.37 and Rs. I4.59,respectively.However, the total number of unit holders and the total numberof units at issue continued to decline, possibly as a result of

many retail investors opting to exit at a profit. The total numberof unit holders and units at issue at end 2005 stood at21,495

and 336 million, respectively. Although equity investments stillaccount for about 65 per cent of the total investments, amarginalchange in the portfolio composition in favour of short-term government securities, was seen.o Venture Capital Firms (VCFs): The venture capitalindustry continued to be afflicted by poor performance,with some companies shifting to new areas of business. Thesix firms in the industry had funded 40 projects with a totalinvestment of about Rs.0.7 billion by end 2005. Some firms

had moved into housing development activities due to the lackof investment opportunities and difficulties encountered inmonitoring of projects.

Contractual Savings Institutionsi Superannuation Funds: The superannuation funds sectorexpanded due to the increase in salaries and wages and anincrease in new employment. Consequently, there was anincrease in the level of savings in the country. The total

assets of all funds, i.e., Employees' Provident Fund (EPF),

Employees' Trust Fund (ETF), Public Service Provident Fund(PSPF), Contributory Pension Fund (CPF) and PrivateProvident Funds (PPF) grew by 9.8 per cent to Rs. 589 billionwhich represented 18.6 per cent of financial system assets at

end 2005. Meanwhile the total savings mobilised by the Fundsincreased to Rs. 38 billion from Rs. 34 billion in 2004, incomparison to the total increase in deposits collected by banks

and finance companies, of about Rs. I l0 billiono The EPF, the main retirement benefit fund for the private

sector, expanded with an increase in the net inflow of fundsand investment income. The total assets of the EPF, which

account for about 72per cent of the superannuation funds in thecountr!, grew by ll.2 per cent to Rs. 422 billion at end 2005.The total contributions and refunds during the year amountedto Rs. 25 billion and Rs. l7 billion, respectively. The totalinvestment portfolio of Rs. 405 billion consisted mainly of

governrnent securities, (98.5 per cent). The Fund earned a gross

income of Rs. 41.8 billion for the year which represented a rate

of return of 10.9 per cent, An effective rate of return of 8.8 per

cent was declared on member balances, as against 9.5 per centin 2004. This is higher than the annual weighted averagedeposit rate of 5.64 per cent and the annual weighted averagefixed deposit rate of 8.26 in 2005.. Expanding the range of benefits to EPF members, a newhousing loan scheme was introduced during the year. Thisscheme named " Shramodha Home Loan Scheme" was

launched in December 2005 to grant housing loans up to amaximum of Rs. 300,000 to eligible EPF members meetin,especified criteria, at a concessionary rate of 4 per cent, throughthe HDFC Bank and the SMIB. One issue in relation to the

housing loans granted against the EPF balances as security is

the high default rate. Ultimately lending institutions recover the

loan from the EPF balance. Hence, this results in an erosion of

the retirement benefits of members who default housing loans.The EPF redesigned its website (www.epf,lk) and updated itregularly to facilitate the provision of information to the publicin Sinhala, Tamil and English.

The ETF, the employer contributory retirement benefit

scheme in the country, too witnessed an increase in its assetbase with increased net contributions and income frominvestments made. The assets and contributions of the ETFincreased by l3.l per cent and l6 per cent in 2005 to Rs. 58.6billion and Rs. 5 billion, respectively. The fund had a net inflowof funds despite its more flexible refund policy of allowingmembers to withdraw their balances once in 5 years wheneverthey leave their jobs. As in the case of other funds, theinvestment portfolio was heavily concentrated in governmentsecurities, providing it a zero credit nsk and higher liquidity.The composition of the portfolio, which consisted ofgovemment securities (93.2 per cent), equities (2.8 per cent )and corporate debt and other assets (4.0 per cent ) recorded amarginal decrease in investments in equities and private debtinstruments at end 2005, possibly due to the sale of equities torealize capital gains at the year end and maturing of debtinstruments held. Private provident funds numbering about 200

, the PSPF and the CPF collectively had an asset base of Rs.

106 billion at end 2005.

Insurance Companies: Despite the impact of the tsunami,the insurance industry recorded a significant growth inpremia, proflrts and assets in 2005. The insurance industry,which consists of 15 firms, engaged in both life and general

insurance business activities, and accounted for 3.3 per cent ofthe total assets of the financial system. The total asset base ofthe industry grew by ll.2per cent to Rs. 105 billion in 2005.

The industry is heavily concentrated with the two biggest firmsaccounting for more than 64 per cent of the assets. Six largefirms account for about 97 per cent of the assets. Insurancepenetration, i.e., the ratio of total gross premia to GDP,

increased from 1.5 per cent to L6 per cent during the year, whileinsurance density, i.e., per capita premium, increased from Rs.1,51I to Rs. 1,921 billion in 2005. Meanwhile, a sum of Rs.l3 billion has been paid by the industry as compensation undertsunami related claims, of which Rs. 9 billion or 70 per cent

has been recovered from re-insurers.

Reflecting the increased insurance penetration broughtabout by deregulation and greater competition, thepremium income of the industry increased significantly in2005. As at end 2005,the totalnet premium income, consistingof long term (Rs. 14.9 billion) and general insurance (Rs.15.4billion) income, was Rs. 30.3 billion. This reflects a growth rateof 26.3 per cent as against a24.3 per cent growth in2004.Product innovation and an increased number of promotionalcampaigns, which could be attributed to competition and thederegulation of the industry, have been contributory factors tothis higher growth. Life and motor insurance, which accounted

for 83 per cent of the total gross premia, grew by 22 pr cent,and25 per cent, respectively.t In line with the policy focus on promoting stronginstitutions within the financial sector, the capitalrequirements of insurance companies were revised upwardduring the year. Accordingly, the capital requirement for newentrants to the insurance industry was increased to Rs. 100million from Rs. 25 million and Rs. 50 million, respectively, forlife and general insurance business, with effect from October2005. At end 2005, the total paid up capital of the industry

amounted to Rs. 8.1 billion, registering a growth rate of 222per

cent, while profits of the industry increased by 36 per cent to

Rs. 2.5 billion during the year. The solvency margin, a measureof soundness of the industry, ranged between 2f50 per cent

and 5 - 6 per cent for general and life insurance, respectively.An enhanced minimum solvency margin of 20 per cent inrespect of general insurance will come into effect by 2007.Cunently, the minimum solvency margin for life and general

business are 5 per cent and l0 per cent, respectively.

8.3 Developments in Financial Markets

lnter-Bank Call Money Marketc The inter-bank call money market, which mainly servescommercial banks in meeting their immediate liquidity

needs and reserve deficiencies continued to remain liquid in

2005, mainly due to Central Bank purchases of the foreigncurrency inllows to the goyernment. Market liquidity washigh at the beginning of the year as the Central Bankdiscontinued temporarily its OMOs following the tsunami

disaster. Later the Cenffal Bank conducted OMOs aggressivelyto absorb excess liquidity from the market.o The inter-bank call money market volumc declined in 2ffi5due to comfortable liquidity conditions in banks. Thevolume of inter-bank transactions was seen declining from alevel of Rs. 3l I billion during the first quarter to Rs. 233 billionin the last quarter of 2005. Similarly, the average daily inter-bank call money transactions declined from Rs. 5.6 billion in

2004 to Rs. 4.5 billion in 2005.s Call money market rates, however, increased in 2005 alongwith the upward revision of policy interest rates of theCentral Bank and with the continuation of high demand forcredit. However, the temporary suspension of the conduct ofOMOs by the Central Bank to facilitate the smooth functioningof financial markets resulted in a decline in call money market

rates during January to March 2005. The weighted avera-{e call

money rate declined from 9.73 pr cent at end 200u[, to 7,50 per

cent by end March 2005 and then gradually increased to 10.73per cent at end 2005. The structural rigidities in the moneymarket as a result of the high concentration of liquidity among

certain banks and the tax differentials associated with inter-bankcall money transactions as opposed to government securitiesresulted in the weighted average call money rate exceeding

above the upper band of the interest rate coridor during the

latter parl of 2005.

Domestic Foreign Exchange Market* Activity in the inter-bank foreign exchange market

expanded significantly as a result of large foreign currencyinflows to the government and the private sector in respect

of tsunami relief and rehabilitation work, export proceeds,benefits of the debt moratorium and increased inflows ofprivate remittances. Consequently, the rupee stabilized vis-i-vis the US dollar despite a significant outflow on account of

large import bills due to the oil price hike.s The stability in the inter-bank forex market led to anincrease in forward market activities during 2005. Theaverage inter-bank spot transactions in 2005 increasedsignificantly to US dollars 25 million in 2005, from the USdollars l4 million recorded in 2004 while the forward

transactions increased from US dollars 4.2 million in 2004 toUS dollars 7.8 million. The average US dollar buying andselling rates of commercial banks for telegraphic transfers

decreased from Rs.l04.l6 and Rs.105.14, respectively at end

2004, to Rs.99.98 and Rs.101.29, respectively by end 2005,registering an appreciation of 4.2 per cent and 3.8 per cent,respectively. The weakening of other major cunencies in the

international market vis-i-vis the US dollar led to a relatively

larger appreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee against other reserve

currencies, namely, the euro (by around l8 per cent), the British

pound (by around 14 per cent) and the Japanese yen (by aroundl8 per cent).r The Central Bank operated on both sides of themarket witha view to reducing the excessive volatility in the foreign

exchange market. The Central Bank purchased US dollars 290

million from commercial banks and sold US dollars 464 million

to commercial banks.

Government Securities Markets The Government securities market improved in terms ofprimary market volume, tenor of the bonds and with theintroduction of index linked bonds. With the tightening of

monetary policy and the continuation of high credit demand, theyield rates increased and in the secondary market there was apreference for short-term instruments. A web based accountverification system was developed which allows accountholders of the system to view their security holdings andearnings through the Internet.c Total issues of Treasury Bills in the primary market

increased during 2005 in comparisonto2ffiA. However, the

net issues of Treasury bills declined in 2005, with repayments

during the year exceeding the total issues of Treasury bills. Net

issues of Treasury bills in 2005 amounted to Rs. 9.7 billion,

compared to Rs. 24 billion in 2004. At the primary market

auctions, market preference for short-term instruments was

reflected in the relatively higher volumes of bids for 9l-day

Treasury bills. The outstanding Treasury bills declined slightly

from Rs. 244 billion at end 20M to Rs. 234 billion by end 2005.

The weighted average yield rates of Treasury Bills increasedgradually during the year, along with the upward revision of the

Central Bank's policy interest rates.. The tenor of the Treasury Bonds at the primary market

increased from the recommencement of the issues of 5 and

8-year tenors for the flrrst time after October 2ffi3. Treasury

Bonds with 3 and 4 - year tenors amounted to issued regularlyin 2005. However, market preference was for shortermaturities. The net issues of Treasury bonds in 2005 were Rs.

108 billion, in comparison to Rs. 160 billion in2004 as the

government resorted to foreign currency bonowings. Yields on

Treasury bonds also rose following the upward movement of

short-term rates.

The government issued its first series of Index Linked

Bonds in December 2005 with a maturity period of 3 yearsin the process of converting the overdraft with the state

banks to Treasury bonds. The coupon rate for the first year

was fixed at ll.2 per cent and the coupon rates for the 2nd and

3'd year will be based on the average annual inflation rate

measured by the changes in the annual moving average of the

CCPI during the immediate previous six months plus a marginof I per cent. This issue of Index Linked bonds amounting to

Rs.22 billion was made by way of a private placement.

Transactions in Treasury bills in the secondary market

increased in 2005 in comparison to 2004rwhile transactionsin Treasury bonds declined. This was due to investors'preference for shorter maturities, with financial marketsexpecting interest rates to rise further. The total outright

transactions of Treasury bills in the secondary market increasedfrom Rs. 390 billions in20M to Rs. 443 billion in 2005, while

the Treasury bill Repo transactions increased from Rs.559billion in2004 to Rs.652 billion in 2005. However, both theoutright transactions and Repo transactions of Treasury bonds

in the secondary market recorded a decline in 2005. The yield

curve for govemment securities in the secondary market shifted

upward alon-e with the increase in primary market rates. It

became shorter by end 2005 as the long-term market became

inactive.

Corporate Debt Securities Market

Commercial Papers (CPs): Commercial paper marketactivity remained relatively sluggish despite incentivesgranted in the form of the elimination of withholding taxin 2005. Commercial papers issued with the support oflicensed commercial banks and licensed specialised banks

amounted to Rs. 10.9 billion at end 2005, in comparison to

Rs.l4.5 billion in 2004. The interest rate on CPs increased

to a range of 8.90- 14.25 per cent in 2005 from 7.75-14.00per cent in 2004. One reason for the decline in the CP

market volumes could be the fact that bonowing at the prime

lending rate, which ranged between 9.53 per cent to 12.42

per cent during the year, was cheaper for many blue chips.The total outstanding value of CPs as at the year end

amounted to Rs. 2.8 billion. A major share of CPs issued wasof less than 3 month maturity.

As proposed in the Budget for 2006, the withholding taxon corporate debt securities will be reintroduced witheffect from April 2006, remove the discriminatory

treatment between interest income from banks and interest

income from corporate debt securities. At present interest

income from bank deposits are charged at l0 per cent, while

interest from corporate debt securities is taxed at the standardmarginal income tax rates ran-eing from 5 to 30 per cent.

Corporate Bondsl The activities in the corporate bondmarket continued to be subdued in 2005 due touncertainties with respect to interest rate behaviour.

During the year two new issues of debentures were listed on the

Colombo Stock Exchange. These mobilised Rs. 350 million.

Seylan Merchant Leasing Ltd, raised Rs. 100 million in July

2005, at interest rates ranging from 10.25- 12.5 per cent, while

Senkadagala Finance Co Ltd. raised Rs. 250 million in October

2005 at a fixed interest rate of 14.00 per cent and a floating rate

of the 9l-day Treasury bill yield plus 275 basis points. There

were 19 issues of debentures outstanding with a total market

capitalisation of Rs. I1.9 billion at end 2W5 . The total turnover

during the year amounted to about Rs.207 million

The underdeveloped nature of the private debt market,particularly the corporate bond market, is attributed to several

factors, such as a lack of institutional investor base, availability

of bank credit at attractive rates for high net worlh companies,high cost of debt issues, lack of investor awareness, lack of

investor information on the quality of debt and non-availabilityof a longer term bench mark yield curve.

Share Markett The Colombo Stock Exchange recorded another positive

year of performance with key market indicators including

the All Share Price Index (ASPI) and the Milanka Price

Index (MPI) reaching record levels by mid-November 2005.

However, a part of the gains posted during the first ten monthsof 2005 dissipated towards the end of the year with the

escalation of tensions in the North and the East, which led to

panic selling. This caused sharp declines in the share priceindices as well as in market capitalisation. The robust

performance of the share market during much of 2005 was

driven by strong corporate earnings. Yields on fixed income

securities, which were low or negative in real terms particularly

during the early part of 2005, also impacted positively on stock

market performance. Another factor that contributed positivelyto share market activity in 2005 was the stability of the

exchange rate. Net foreign inflows to the Colombo Stock

Exchange (CSE) amounted to US dollars 62 million in 2005,

the highest for a year, so far. Fufther, the inclusion of Sri Lankaby the California Public Employees' Retirement System

There were three successful initialpublic offerings (IPOs) durin_e the year, namely, those of DialogTelecom, HDFC Bank and Sierra Cables. Among them, DialogTelecom, which was the largest IPO in the history of the CSE,attracted both domestic funds and significant inflows of foreignfunds. The HDFC bank is the first government owned financialinstitution that made a public offering of shares.o Share prices and profits of companies of most sectorsimproved significantly during the year. This was due to thecontinued growth momentum in the domestic and externaleconomies. The sectoral indices for Telecommunications.Diversified Holdings and Bank, Finance and Insurance, whichtogether account for 68 per cent of market capitalisation,increased by 74 per cent, 2L per cent and 38 per cent,respectively. A few sector indices retreated during the year.Amongst these were Power and Energy (-22 per cent),Construction and Engineering (-5 per cent), Chemicals andPharmaceuticals (-4 per cent), Hotels and Travels (-2 per cent)and Footwear and Textiles (- I per cent).s The opening of the third branch of the CSE in Kurunegalaearly in the year was another positive step towards marketdevelopment. It will help expand local investor participation

at the CSE.

8.4 Development Finance and Access toFinance

Development Finances Development finance and rural financial sector institutionsexpanded in 2005, The Central Bank introduced three credit

schemes and the National Development Trust Fund (NDTF)introduced one credit sche me in 2005 for the resumption ofmicro, small and medium scale enterprises (MSMEs), whichwere damaged by the tsunami in 2004. Furthermore, theCentral Bank in consultation with the government introducedtwo credit guarantee schemes to encourage banks to grantfacilities to tsunami affected enterprises, and to the apparelsector, which suffered from the termination of the MFA. Thegovernment assisted the state banks to reschedule longoutstanding loans granted to rice millers in the agriculturaldistricts with a view to rehabilitating the milling industry bydeveloping its capacity to absorb the increased paddyproduction in the country. Under the Rural Finance SectorDevelopment Project funded by the Asian Development Bank(ADB), preliminary arrangements were finalized forrestructuring the Regional Development Banks (RDBs) andCooperative Rural Banks (CRBs) in the country. The CentralBank has also undertaken the task of developing an enablinglegal environment for rural financial sector institutions for

sustainable outreach and viable operations of the sector.{s Microflrnance schemes were continued with the assistanceof the Central Bank and several other banks. The CentralBank continued to operate the Small Farmers and LandlessCredit Project (SFLCP) and the Poverty Alleviation andMicrofinance Project (PAMP) with the assistance of theGovernment of Sri Lanka (GOSL) and the Japan Bank forInternational Cooperation (JBIC) in ten districts of the countryin 2005. Three more districts, Jaffna, Trincomalee andBatticaloa, were brou_eht under the PAMP in 2005. Further, theNew Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS) wasintroduced to Jat-fna, Kilinochchi and Vavuniya districts in2005. Short-term production loans.rranted under the NCRCS

reported a significant growth of Rs.l.6 billion in 2005. Loansgranted under Forward Sales Contracts for purchasing

agricultural commodities also increased to 1256loans totallingRs.2.4billion in 2005. Bank of Ceylon, People's Bank, HattonNational Bank, Seylan Bank, Sanasa Development Bank and

six Regional Development Banks continued their own microcredit programmes with the assistance of Community Based

Organizations (CBOs) and RuralFinance Institutions (RFIs) in

2005.

Enhancement of Access to Finance. The efforts to enhance access to finance were continued withthe implementation of several measures during the year.

These included the introduction of micro finance schemes, the

establishment of the SME Bank, permitting the acceptance offoreign currency deposits by the NSB and undertakingpreparatory work on a legal framework for the regulation ofmicro finance institutions. ,r The provision of credit facilities to micro, small andmedium scale industries expanded during the year. Asignificant event was the establishment of the SME bank to

cater to the SME sector in the country. The Central Bank

continued to operate the Small Farmers and Landless. Credithoject (SFLCP) and the Poverty Alleviation and Microfinance

Project (PAMP) covering l0 districts. Two commercial banksjoined the Central Bank to expand the micro creditprograrrmes to the North and the East with assistance from

the Japan Bank for International Co-operation (JBIC) in the

latter part of the year. Activities of the New Comprehensive

Rural Credit Scheme (NCRCS) were fufther expanded during

the year.. Measures were taken to expand the channels for savingsmobilisation and fund transfers in the rural sector, expandthe current postal outlets and set up service centres,

especially to expand flrnancial facilities for micro and smalllending for cottage industric and migrant worker families.

Branches of the NSB are expected to be linked on-line to the

postal outlets comprising over 4,M8 outlets covering the entirecountry. The combination of the two institutions would beof use to enhance access to finance. The proposed set upwould facilitate migrant worker remittances through postoffices and encourage micro and small lending for cottageindustries. Furthermore, permission was granted to NSB to

accept foreign cuffency deposits enabling migrant workers toremit foreign funds directly to their dependents at the grass

root level. The granting of direct access status to NSB throughSLPS would enable public servants to remit salaries to their

accounts maintained at NSB and to introduce housing loan

products to them on the strength of their salary remittances.

Banks have been asked to set up service centres to encourageSMEs, provide project consultancy services and minimiseditficulties faced by SMEs in accessing finance. It has also

been proposed to upgrade the present Credit InformationBureau (CRIB) by increasing its capabilities to build up a

database for SMEs and micro enterprises and by providing

positive credit intbrmation on the sector to lending institutions.

Action has been taken to amend the CRIB Act and upgradeits IT system.

8.5 Financial Infrastructure

Payment and Settlement Systemso As an efficient and reliable payment system contributes to

improve the soundness of the financial system, the Central

Bank took further measures to strengthen the payment and

settlement systems while minimising the risks involved.With a view to providin-e wider powers to the Central Bank to

oversee the payment and settlement systems and money seruice

providers and to facilitate electronic presentment of cheques,

the Payment and Settlement Systems Act No. 28 was enactedin September 2005.r The Central Bank performs three key roles in the payment

and settlement systems by overseeing payment systems,operating systemically important payment and settlement

systems and inducing changes for the further developmentof the payment services. In addition to the Central Bank, the

main providers of payment services are the licensed commercial

banks. The settlement of securities is handled by Lankasecure,which clears government securities while the Central

Depository System (Pvt.) Ltd., a fully owned subsidiary of the

CSE, handles equity settlements. Banking institutions, taking

advantage of the improvement in information technology,

enhanced their services further by offering credit cards and

debit card facilities with added features, home banking andinternet bankin-e, expanding the type of payment modesavailable to their customers. The number of ATMs and

EFIPOS too have increased increasing convenience and access

to banking facilities and payments.r With the intention of broad-basing the benefits derivedfrom the development of the payment systems to the retailend of the market, LankaClear is in the process ofintroducing a cheque imaging and truncation system. This

would improve the processing of retail and low-value payments

effected primarily through cheques by reducing significantlythe cheque realization times throughout the country thusbenefiting the general public. Under this, eleven regional

centres have been set-up by LankaClear around the island. The

system is expected to commence live operations in mid-2006.r The Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS), which

was introduced in z00s,continued to be the main inter-bankfund transferring system in Sri Lanka for urgent and high

value payments. The RTGS covered 83 per cent of the total

value of non-cash payment instruments. During the year, total

transactions settled through the RTGS increased by 8 per centto 149,621 transactions while the total value of such settled

transactions increased by 28 per cent to Rs. 17,543 billion. The

share of transactions with a value less than Rs. 50 million by

size represented 68 per cent of the total number of transactions.

The share of transactions over Rs. 1,000 million accounted for35 per cent of the total value of RTGS transactions. The

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2OO5137

Part lChapter I - FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND STABIL|TY

majority of the RTGS payments were in relation to transactionsin the call money market, the government securities market, the

forei-en exchan_ee market (rupee leg), Central Bank OMOs, thesettlement of net clearing obligations and urgent payments ofcustomers.c The Central Bank continued to provide the intra-dayliquidity facility (ILf) to participating institutions in theRTGS system against the collateral of governmentsecurities. The use of this facility declined with improvedliquidity management by market participants as a result ofexperience gained in estimatin-e the required liquidity to settletransactions. The daily average value of ILF taken was Rs 2.3billion in 2005 in comparison to Rs. 2.7 billion in2004.o Inter-Bank Clearing Systems Operated by LankaClear -the main Cheque Clearing System. The total value ofcheques cleared through the main cheque clearing system ofLankaClear represented l6 per cent of the total value of non-cash payments. The total number of cheques cleared byLankaClear increased by 6 per cent to 40.1 million in 2005 from37.7million in 2004 and the total value of cheques clearedincreased by 14 per cent to Rs.3,385 billion from Rs. 2,965bilfion in20M.. Scripless Securities Settlement (SSS) System: During rheyear, all the new issues of Government Treasury bills andTreasury bonds were in scripless form. The total value ofscripless securities held by LankaSecure at the end of 2005amounted to Rs.958 billion. This accounts for 97.3 per cent ofthe total value of Treasury bills and Treasury bondsoutstanding. These scripless securities consisted of Rs.234billion Treasury bills and Rs.724billion Treasury bonds. At the

end of 2005, lankaSecure mai n tai ned 24,41 I accounts throu ghdirect participants, relating to the portfolio of individuals andcorporate customers.. The activities of the Sri Lanka Inter-bank PaymentSystem (SLIPS), which is the major offline inter-bankretail payment system where only electronic instructionsare issued to effect payments, expanded further.This system facilitates the transfer of funds directly by LCBsand the Central Bank as well as customers of LCBs.SLIPS operated by LankaClear cleared Rs. 87 billion wofth oftransactions in 2005 recording a 45 per cent increase when

compared with 20M.

Legislative Enactments and Reforms. The Central Bank continued its efforts to review the existinglegal framework while introducing new legislation tofacilitate the smooth functioning of the financial system.Addressing many uncertainties and lacunae that existed in theBanking Act, No. 30 of 1988 and widening the scope ofregulatory control, the Banking (Amendment) Act No. 2 of2005 was passed in February 2005. The most significantprovisions introduced by this amendment are the 'fit andproper' criteria tbr directors, strengthening of provisions to

minimise the concentration of ownership of Iicensed banks andstrengthening ofthe governance aspects oflicensed banks. Thedefinition of the term 'deposit' was also expanded with theseamendments in order to strengthen depositor protection. Theseamendments have also played a significant role in safeguardin-e

the stability of the financial system of Sri Lanka.e Another important development is the enactment of thePayment and Settlement Act, which will strengthen the tegalframework governing payment services. This carriesprovisions for the regulation of the payment, clearing andsettlement systems, for the regulation of providers of money

services and for the electronic presentment of cheques.I Enabling the leasing companies to securitise their leaseportfolios, the Finance Leasing Act was amended. Thiswould enable the finance leasing companies to finance theirworking capital needs, which, in turn, would ease their issuesrelating to liquidity shortfalls. Broader issues relating tosecuritisation in general are also under consideration with aview to developing more generic le,eislation on the subject.t Another recent development around the world is therecognition of the risks posed to the financial sector byfinancing of terrorism and money laundering. Sri Lankajoined the global effort to combat money-laundering andterrorist financing by passing the Prevention of TerroristFinancing Act in mid 2005. The Anti-Money Laundering Bill

and a Financial Transactions Reporting Bill were presented tothe Legislature in 2005 and was passed in January 2006.Cunently, the FIs are directed to adopt 'Know Your Customer'(KYC) principles to identify possible and questionabletransactions involving money laundering.

Regulation and Supervisiono The Central Bank, which is responsible for regulating andsupervising all major financial institutions, undertookseveral regulatory and supervisory initiatives in 2005 toenhance the soundness and efficiency of the financialsystem. The institutions supervised and regulated by theCentral Bank include LCBs, LSBs, finance companies andprimary dealers. The Central Bank is also assigned with theresponsibility of overseeing payment and settlement systems,registering and monitoring leasing establishments andregulating money changers. In addition, the Central Bank

mana-qes the EPF. The Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) is responsible for licensing and regulating the stockexchange, stock brokers and unit trusts. It also registersunderwriters, margin providers, credit rating agencies,investment managers and securities clearing houses. TheInsurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL) regulates insurancecompanies with a view to safeguarding the interests of thepolicyholders. The Central Bank also took the initiative in 2005

to establish coordination with the other regulatory agencies to

enhance the regulation and supervision of domestic financial

conglomerates.

Overall Benetit from Basel ll

Basel II in its present form is a formidable regulatory tool,

whrch would insulate banks against a broad spectrum of risks.Maintenance of capital under Basel II relies heavily on the

Box 17 (Contd.)

internal risk management systems of banks; Therefore, it isnecessary to develop a risk management culture in order toreap the benefits of Basle II. The banks should view risk

management not as an exercise in complying with regulatoryrequirements, but rather as a means for greater opportunitieswhere the differentiation of risks atforded under Basle IIwould lead to greater price competition through the level ofcapital allocatbd to each risk. In this contextr therefore,Basle II calls for a radical change in the credit culture fromone that is predicated on collateral to a culture that isintrinsically hinged on information. : i

Moving further in line with international best practices, aroad map for the implementation of the Basel II CapitalAccord through the standardized and basic indicatorapproaches in 2008, was issued to the banking industry.Banks were initially requested to make a self-assessment ofBasel II. A Committee composed of representatives frombanks and the Central Bank was set up to resolveimplementation issues. The framework for the implementationof the capital charge for market risk with effect from March

2006 was finalized.

With respect to the regulation of banking institutions,several new prudential requirements were issued, (i)

requiring bank directors to submit an affidavit and a declarationthat they are fit and proper persons, (ii) permitting banks tooffer banking products based on Islamic principles subject to

compliance with existing prudential requirements, (iii) raisingthe minimum capital requirement, (iv) specifying theaccommodation to related parties, (v) specifying the singlebonower limit (SBL) on a uniform basis for allbanks, and (vi)

requinng banks to enhance disclosure of financial statements.

The supervisory function continued with a two prongedapproach, i.e., the continuous monitoring of the health ofbanks through off-site surveillance and on-site examinationof banks within a defined statutory period i.e., once in twoyears. The timeliness of the assessment of the risk exposureof individual banks, and of the banking system as a whole

improved throu,eh off-site surveillance, which serves as an early

warnin-e system in identifying significant and critical changesin the financial condition of banks, which require furtherinvestigation and examination; and a new on-line web-based

reportin-q system, which was launched on a test basis, whichwill be fully implemented in 2006. The on-site examinationprocess tbcused on the identification of banking risks, the

management of these risks and the assessment of the adequacyof resources to mitigate the risks.

s The programme for improving public awareness of thefinancial system continued through the issue of press

releases, press advertisements and a series of pamphlets.

Throu-{h these publications, the public was advised to assess andbe cautious of the risks and return on their transactions with

fi nancial institutions.t Several directions were issued covering the operations ofspecialised leasing companies to promote their soundness.These included minimum capital requirements, provision for

bad and doubtful debts, single bonower limit, maintaining debt/equity ratios (gearing ratios), provisionin-e for accrued interest

and building of a reserve fund.

Credit Rating and Credit Informationo The first ever sovereign rating by the government of SriLanka was obtained in 2005. This will facilitate the raisingof finance particularly from the international market.Fitch Ratings assigned a long-term foreign and Iocal currencyratings of 'BB-' (BB minus) while Standard and Poorsassigned B+.s The number of credit rating agencies operating in Sri Lankaincreased to two, with a Malaysian credit rating agencybeing set up in 2005. Following the Bud-eet 2004 proposal

mandating all deposit taking institutions to obtain and publish

credit ratings, the Central Bank advised all bankin-e institutions

to obtain credit ratings from independent rating a_eencies andpublish them to further improve investor confidence in thefinancial system. By end December 2005, 20 financialinstitutions had obtained and published credit ratings.Altogether, l0 banking institutions had submitted the ratin-e

obtained by the parent bank.s The Credit Information Bureau (CRIB), which collects andcollates information on borrowers and furnishes suchinformation to shareholding lending institutions, recordedan increase in the number of credit reports, catering to

140Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2005

Part IChapter 8 - FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND STABILITY

increased demand. With the high expansion in private sector

credit, lending institutions have been making increased use of

credit information as a primary risk management tool. The

CRIB has issued 601,990 credit reports during 2005 compared

to 50l,l4l credit repofis in2004.I The Bureau continues to collect positive information(regular) of Rs.500,000 and above and negative information(irregular) on advances of Rs. 100,000 and above and ofcredit cards of Rs.5,000 and above. CRIB has fixed these

reporting thresholds for the collection of information due to the

prevailing technological constraints, CRIB is in the process of

upgrading its ICT system with a view to reducin-q the cunent

thresholds and improvin-e the coverage, under a modemizationproject. It is expected to service all segments of the credit

market.

8.6 Financial System Stability& Maintaining financial system stability is one of the twomajor objectives of the Central Bank in terms of theamendments made to the Monetary Law Act in 2002.Financial stability is heavily dependent on stability in the

macroeconomic environment, the soundness of the users of thefinancial system and systemically important financial

institutions (SIFIs), the stabiliry of markets and the soundnessof infrastructure, A stable financial system fosters a stablepayment and settlement system, facilitating the smoothfunctioning of economic activities of a country.

The financial sector remained resilient, despite severalmajor shocks which impacted on the economy especially in

early 2005. The tsunami disaster did not have a material impacton the financial system. On the contrary, si-{nificantcontributions from the financial sector helped miti-eate the

impact of the tsunami disaster on the economy. Both money

and capital markets remained liquid during the recovery in early

2005 due to the efforts of the Central Bank and other financialinstitutions, The continuing expansion in private sector credit,particularly in relation to consumption and housing, and the

continuation of hi-eh oil prices raised concems about financial

stability.

Systemically important Frnancial institutions (SIFIs), whichinclude major LCBs, LSBs, FCs, and the EPF, hold about72 per cent of financial assets. Their financial situationremained healthy in 2005 as reflected in their keyindicators, Improvements were seen in capital levels, NPL

ratios, provision coverage for losses, and profits. The credit risk

declined with falling NPL ratios. Liquidity levels remained

above the statutory minimum level of 20 per cent. Although the

market risks, particularly the interest rate risk, increased with

the rise jn malket interest rates, the risk absorptive capacity, as

reflected by the availability of adequate capital, profits andother risk mana-qements tools, improved. Both profits andequity increased, improving the resilience of financialinstitutions. Resilience will improve further with the

implementation of business continuity plans (BCP) and disaster

recovery sites (DRS), as required by the Central Bank.

The EPF managed to mitigate risks as a large part of the

investments of the EPF was in government securities. Since

its receipts continued to remain above the cash outflows, it did

not face a liquidity risk in 2005. The credit risk in the EPF is

negligible since almost all its funds are invested in risk free

government securities. Although the interest rate risk increased

with the increase in market rates, it was mitigated considerably,

given the high level of liquidity and as most funds are held in

the form of investments. However, it is desirable to take

measures to face future risks in the face of changing accounting

practices, which may require investments to be evaluated at

market prices.

Financial sector infrastructure, consisting of payment and

settlement systems, the supervisory and regulatory regime,

and the legal framework, further improved in 2ffi5. A road

map for the implementation of the Basel II Capital Accord in

2008 was issued to the banking industry. Accordingly, the

standardised and basic indicator approaches will be used in

assessing the capital requirements in terms of the credit and

operational risks, under the new Accord. A capital charge for

the market risk will be implemented in 2006. Risks in the

payment and settlement systems were further reduced with the

introduction of BCP and DRS for participants, the enactmentof the Payment and Settlement Act and the imposition of a

default charge on delayed payments. The stability of the

Box 18Rationale for Establishing Ownership Restrictions in Banks

Ownership restrictions complement the efforts of regulationand supervjsion of banks, Banking firms are regulated andsupervised for three major reasons. Filst, the bankin_eindustry in many countries is an oligopoly. The entry into theindustry is not free, and is constrained by licensingrequirements, entry capital requirements, economic needstests, fit and proper tests of owners and senior managementetc. The exit of a banking firm is also not simple andstraightforward. Second, the body of consumers of thesetvices of the banking industry could be constrained in thechoice of a banking firm by appropriate restrictions on capitalaccount transactions, such as restrictions on cross bordertrade in financial services. Hence, the domestic industryenjoys privileges of serving a captive body of consumers.Third, the banking industry acquires contingenr liabilities,develops serious inter-connections among various firms inthe industry and firm.s and households in the entire economy.Hence, in the absence of sufficiently strict and effectiveregulation and supervision coupled with weak enforcementof banking laws, there are possibilities that an owner couldrun the banking firm in ways that are harmful ro thedepositors and the country as a whole. Thus, these threeconsiderations require establishing rules. effective regulation,and supervision that ensure smooth functioning of the

b_anking industry displaying sound corporate governancepractices. The extent of those rules, re_{ulatory andsupervisory nonns and practices are diverse among countries.Objectives of ownership restrictions are to have a well-diversified ownership, which could minimise the risk ofmisuse or imprudent use of leveraged funds. Meanwhile, lowlevels of ownership may not provide adequate incentives forowners to employ suff rcient attention to the banking firm. Itshould also be emphasised that ownership restrictions are notsubstitutes tbr effective supervision and regulation. Further,the fit and proper criteria, on a continuin_e basis, have to bethe over-riding consideration in the path of ensuringcorporate governance. Ownership restrictions have to be

complemented ivith adequate equity investments, appropriaterestructuring and consolidation in the banking sector.The World Bank conducts surveys on features offinancial sectors in its member countries. As per the 2003survey, out of 157 countries, lI2 countries do not have anyownership limitatjons.' Majority of those countries haveefficient financial systems, low capital account restdctions.and are at a higher level of economic deveiopment. Theremainin-e 45 countries impose restrictions ranging from 5-

1 World 8ank, 2003, Dalabase on Bank Supervision and Regulation.

50 per cent. Howeveri some of those countries are at a lowerlevel of economic development, displaying weak regulationand supervision, and are at low degrees of financial systemefficiency. Those countries have preferred to imposerestrictions to establish 'rules' on ownership which areeffective in replacing weak supervision and regulation, and

as an alternative to weak enforcement of regulatory norms ongood governance. The ownership structure could becategorised into three. those with no restrictions, thoserequiring at least two owners, and those with ownership limitsmostly in the range of 5-20 percent (Chart B 18.1).Chart B18.2 shorvs that the degree of financial systemefficiency does not have any relationship with ownership.2However, most efficient countries _eenerally do not have anyrestrictions. Chart 818.3 further shows that the per capitaincome does not conelate well with ownership.Sri Lanka has restricted single ownership to 10 per centin the Banking Act, but has allowed increases through adirection permitting up to 15, 20 and 25 percenr for specifiedentities, In the case of Sri Lanka, the two major concerns thatarise in the context of corporate governance in banks andwhich need to be addressed are (i) the concentration ofownership and (ii) the type of people who control the bank i.e.the fit and proper status of major shareholders and directors.There ate unique corporate governance challenges posedwhere the bank ownership structufe either lacks transparencyor where there are insufficient checks and balances oninappropriate activities or influences of controllin_{shareholders.Further measures are needed to support the effectivesupervisory mechanism currently in place. Among them,major measures are adequate legal force to strengthenenforcement action, well developed public inflastructurecovering contract enforcement, a general insolvency regime,

an accounting framework, a corporate governance regime,market discipline based on transpar*ncy and disclosureprocedures for effective resolution of problem banki, and a

payment system received a boost with RTGS and Lanka Securebeing certified as compliant with the ten coreprinciples of systemically important payment and

settlement systems and intemational best practices, as set out bythe Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and theInternational Organization of Securities Commissions(rosco).

Financial market stability was improved in 2005. Although

the stock market -qrew at a relatively high pace, it did not pose

a threat to the stability of the financial markets. The increases

in prices were consistent with the fundamentals of the corporate

sector.

The legal and regulatory system was further strengthenedto support the resilience of the financial system. Theintroduction of provisions relating to the 'fit and proper test' forboards of directors, the interpretation of the term 'deposit',

Islamic banking, and governance aspects of banks, providegreater clarity for re_eulatory puroposes. Similar clarity wasintroduced to the regulation of the payment, clearing andsettlement systems and the re_eulation of money chan_eersand electronic cheques. Further, an amendmenf was madeto the Banking Act to prohibit fraudulent net-workmarketing practices.

G Financial system stability is maintained, but severaldownside risks exist. The rising oil prices could further worsen

the current account deficit thereby impacting on stability in theeconomic environment, which is necessary for financialstability. Fiscal consolidation has not yet been achieved andhigh fiscal deficits could have an impact on the performance ofinstitutions and markets. Another perennial issue in thefinancial sector is the need for improvements in access to

finance . In this regard, the government's intervention throughthe settin-q up of specialised financial institutions to enhance

access to finance in specific areas is a positive development.However, there could be sustainability issues if a long termvision for these entities is lacking, making it difficult for themto face competition effectively in the future. The growth in

credit to the private sector is still high, and it could impair creditquality. With the implementation of the capital charge formarket risk in 2006, a need for the infusion of fresh capital by
