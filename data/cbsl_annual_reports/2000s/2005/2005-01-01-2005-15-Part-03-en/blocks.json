The revision is aimed at increasing the transparency of banking operations, and to ali-en the publicationrequirements with those of other re-eulators. Accordingly, the formats have been drafted incorporating thedisclosure requirements of the Securities and Exchange Cornmission (SEC)(in respect of listed banks) andthe Sri Lanka Accountin-e Standards, as far as possible. In addition, selected performance indicators,including key prudential ratios have been included, as agreed with the banks.3. The information published should be in respect of the entire bank, i.e. including the off-shore bankingunit and in the case of LCBs incorporated in Sri Lanka, ?fly branches abroad.4. The new format contains two parts viz;o Part I : The format for the summarized balance sheet, income statement, and the statement ofchanges in equity and reserves and selected performance indicatorso Part II : Instructions for Preparation of Bank Accounts for publication in the press5. Balance Sheet inforrnation should be reported as at end of the relevant quarter. Cornparative figures tobe published should be based on the audited financial statements for the previous financial year.5.1 The reporting period in respect of the income statement should be the cumulative position as atthe end of the relevant quarter in the financial year.

The Authorised Dealers should obtain acertificate issued by the Sri Lanka Export Developrnent Board (EDB) or tlre Board of Investments ofSri Lanka (BOI) to the indirect exporter, confirmin-q that the domestic value addition of his supplies tothe direct exporter is 35Vo or more of the value of the products. Such certificates will be issued by theEDB in respect of non BOI enterprises and BOI in respect of BOI enterprises after careful assessmentof the value added component of the products.Debits to an IEFCA should be restricted only to the payments to be made in forei-en exchange by anindirect exporter for his imported input requirements and for direct conversions into Sri Lanka Rupees.Foreign currency such as notes and TCs slrould not be issued a-eainst an IEFCA.The balance carried forward in each IEFCA at the end of each month should not exceed US$ 5,000and all excess monies held in the account at the end of the month over US$ 5,000 should be convertedinto Sri Lanka Rupees. The Authorised Dealer should obtain a written consent from the indirectexporter to that effect at the time of openin-e of the account.(vi) Once an indirect exponer ceases his business, Authorised Dealer should withdraw the facility granted tohim by convertin-s the entire balance in the account into Rupees within 60 days from the cessation of hisbusiness as an indirect exporter. The EDB and the BOI are expected to review the status of indirectexporters with respect to the value added component of their product at least once a year.(vii) Quarterly statement indicating the a-egregated debits and credits to all IEFCAs should be forwarded tothe Exchan-ee Control Department, addressed to Branch \"D\" before the expiry of the l5'r' day of thefollowing quarter.For the purpose of these Operatin,e Instructior.rs, indirect exporters are defined as \"any person or entitymanufacturin-e/processin-e/sub-contractin-e/ or supplying a product in the final form directly to an exporter\".",

    "text": "(c) Cross Currency Swaps: Cross currency swap is an a-qreernent between two parties to exchangeinterest payments denominated in two different currencies for a specified term. One interestpayment is typically calculated using a floating rate index such as USD LIBOR. The otherinterest payment is based upor.r a fixed rate or another floatin-e rate index denorninated in adifferent currency. Unlike a sin-qle currency swap, a Cross Currency swap sometirnes (but notalways) involves an exchan-ee of principal. The initial principal exchan-ee occurs at thebe-einnin-e of the swap with a re-exchange at maturity. The principal alnounts are based oninitial spot exchange rates.(d) Currency Option are contract that -eive the buyer the ri-eht but not tlre obligation to exchange(buy/sell) an amount of currency for another at a specific price on or before a pre specified date.For this ri-eht, the buyer pays a prernium. The ri-eht to buy is known as a Call Option while theri-eht to sell is known as Put Option. If suclr right can be exercised only on a specific maturitydate, the option is said to be a European Option. If such option can be exercised on any dateprior to its maturity, the option is called an American Option.(e) Interest Rate Options: is an option where the underlyin-e is not an asset but an interest rate. Aninterest rate Call Option is an option that grants the holder the right to make a fixed or knowninterest payment while an interest rate Put Option is an option that grants the holder the ri_eht tomake a variable or unknown interest payment and receive a fixed or known interest payment. Inan interest rate Cap for example, the seller agrees to compensate the buyer for the amount bywhich an underlying short-term rate exceeds a specified rate on a series of dates durin_e the life ofthe contract. In an interest rate Floor, the seller a-qrees to compensate the buyer for a rate fallingbellow the specified rate durin-e the contract period. A Collar is a combination of a long (short)cap and short (long) floor, struck at different rates payment while an interest rate related to thechange in an interest rate.(O Commodity Options are similar to Currency Optionscommodities for possible derivative transactions.4.
