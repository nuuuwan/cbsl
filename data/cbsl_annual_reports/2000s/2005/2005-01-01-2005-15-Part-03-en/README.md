Any amount that cannot be lent in thislnanner to be deposited in the reserve account with the CBSL.4. The appreciation/depreciation in the capital maintained in foreign currency in Rupee terms, to becredlteO-ldebited to a separate account named 'Exchange Equalisation Account' which should not beincluded as part of capital for prudential purposes.

PUBLIC DISCLOSURE BY PUBLICATION OF QUARTERLY FINANCIALSTATEMENTS OF BANKS IN THE PRESS

As discussed at the rneeting of the CEOs of LCBs held on 28 July 2005, the format for publication ofquarterly financial statements in the press has been revised in consultation with the representative of banks,and is attached herewith, along with the su-egested Sinhala and Tamil translations.2. The revision is aimed at increasing the transparency of banking operations, and to ali-en the publicationrequirements with those of other re-eulators. Accordingly, the formats have been drafted incorporating thedisclosure requirements of the Securities and Exchange Cornmission (SEC)(in respect of listed banks) andthe Sri Lanka Accountin-e Standards, as far as possible. In addition, selected performance indicators,including key prudential ratios have been included, as agreed with the banks.3. The information published should be in respect of the entire bank, i.e. including the off-shore bankingunit and in the case of LCBs incorporated in Sri Lanka, ?fly branches abroad.4. The new format contains two parts viz;o Part I : The format for the summarized balance sheet, income statement, and the statement ofchanges in equity and reserves and selected performance indicatorso Part II : Instructions for Preparation of Bank Accounts for publication in the press5. Balance Sheet inforrnation should be reported as at end of the relevant quarter. Cornparative figures tobe published should be based on the audited financial statements for the previous financial year.5.1 The reporting period in respect of the income statement should be the cumulative position as atthe end of the relevant quarter in the financial year. Comparative figures should be in respect ofthe same reporting period in the previous financial year.5.2 In the case of selected performance indicators, the relevant ratios as at the reporting date slrouldbe reported while the comparative ratios should be based on the audited financial statements forthe previous financial year.6. The publication should be made within two months from the end of each quarter, at least once in anEnglish, Sinhala and Tarnil newspaper. If the bank publishes its annual audited financial statementswithin two months from the end of the financial ye^r, the requirement to publish the financialstatements for the fourth quarter in terms of these instructions would not be mandatory.7. The licensed commercial banks incorporated abroad rnay report information pertaining to the globaloperations of the parent bank, in the column for reporting the information on the Group. Sucltinforrnation may be reported in the currency of the home country or in US Dollars. In view of theheterogeneous character of group accounts of foreign banks, the banks are requested to make everyendeavour to publislr all items given in the agreed format.8. The disclosure requirements contained herein specify the minimum requirements to be adopted by thebanks and all banks are encouraged to make additional disclosures for the benefit of the general public.In addition, the banks listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange should comply with any additionalregulations imposed by the SEC with regard to publication of financial information.9. The revised publication format will be effective for publication of banks' financial statements from the

3'd quarter of 2005 onwards.9.1 The codes indicated in the formats are for cross reference with the definitions in tlre instructionsand not for publication.l0.The circular dated 30 January 2003 on the publicatiorr of quarterly financial statements is herebyrescinded.

Please acknowled-ee receipt of this circular.

(c) Cross Currency Swaps: Cross currency swap is an a-qreernent between two parties to exchangeinterest payments denominated in two different currencies for a specified term. One interestpayment is typically calculated using a floating rate index such as USD LIBOR. The otherinterest payment is based upor.r a fixed rate or another floatin-e rate index denorninated in adifferent currency. Unlike a sin-qle currency swap, a Cross Currency swap sometirnes (but notalways) involves an exchan-ee of principal. The initial principal exchan-ee occurs at thebe-einnin-e of the swap with a re-exchange at maturity. The principal alnounts are based oninitial spot exchange rates.(d) Currency Option are contract that -eive the buyer the ri-eht but not tlre obligation to exchange(buy/sell) an amount of currency for another at a specific price on or before a pre specified date.For this ri-eht, the buyer pays a prernium.

If suclr right can be exercised only on a specific maturitydate, the option is said to be a European Option. If such option can be exercised on any dateprior to its maturity, the option is called an American Option.(e) Interest Rate Options: is an option where the underlyin-e is not an asset but an interest rate. Aninterest rate Call Option is an option that grants the holder the right to make a fixed or knowninterest payment while an interest rate Put Option is an option that grants the holder the ri_eht tomake a variable or unknown interest payment and receive a fixed or known interest payment. Inan interest rate Cap for example, the seller agrees to compensate the buyer for the amount bywhich an underlying short-term rate exceeds a specified rate on a series of dates durin_e the life ofthe contract. In an interest rate Floor, the seller a-qrees to compensate the buyer for a rate fallingbellow the specified rate durin-e the contract period. A Collar is a combination of a long (short)cap and short (long) floor, struck at different rates payment while an interest rate related to thechange in an interest rate.(O Commodity Options are similar to Currency Optionscommodities for possible derivative transactions.4.
