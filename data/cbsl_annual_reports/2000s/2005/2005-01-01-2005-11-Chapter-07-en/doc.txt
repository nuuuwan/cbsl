MONETARY POLICY MONEY CREDIT AND INTEREST RATES

7.1 Overviews The thrust of monetary policy throughout 2005 was oncurbing burgeoning inflationary pressures in the economy,while supporting economic growth and mitigating the

negative impacts of several adverse shocks. After the lowinflation period that ended in 2003, monetary policy

accommodation was gradually withdrawn in2004 and 2005.

This was accomplished in 2005 in the face of several challenges

and uncertainties impinging on macroeconomic management.

These included the escalating oil prices, the impact of the

phasing out of the Multi Fibre Anangement on Sri Lanka's

largest export industry, and the financing of tsunami relatedrelief, rehabilitation and reconstruction. While theseuncertainties dissipated gradually as the year progressed,foreign inflows continued strengthening the balance of

payments position and exchange rate stability while at the sametime raising domestic liquidity and posing problems for

monetary management.r Monetary policy responded proactively to the manifestationof adverse inflation expectations and the relatively high

expansion in money and credit aggregates throughout 2005.Money and credit aggregates began to rise at a faster rate

leading to adverse inflation expectations as witnessed in the

upward pressure on market interest rates, especially yields ongovernment securities. The Central Bank raised its policy

interest rates gradually by 125 basis points in four steps, and

mopped up excess liquidity through aggressive open market

operations (OMOs) on an overnight and permanent bases tocurb the excessive growth in monetary aggregates and to

dampen inflation expectations.s The economy responded well to the tightening of monetarypolicy as evidenced in the increase in market interest rates,which slowed down monetary expansion and moderatedinllation and inflation expectations. In response to monetarypolicy m€asures, market interest rates increased graduallyenabling the deceleration in growth in money and credit

ag-qregates, resulting in a slow down in inflation. The

expansion in reserve money decelerated to the targeted growth

path by end December 2005 while broad money growth also

slowed down but lemained above the desired path. A decline

in inflationary expectations was evident from the decline in the

forward premia in the foreign exchange market and the stability

in secondary market yields on government securities towards

the latter part of the year. These developments led to the

moderation in inflation, which was supported by favourable

supply side developments.

7.2 Monetary Policy* The Central Bank conducted monetary policy operationswithin the monetary targeting framework, under an

independently fl oating exchange rate system. Reserve money(high powered money) and broad money (M^),continued to be

the operating and intermediate targets, respectively. Monetary

operations were conducted to achieve the pre-determined pathof reserve money targets using active open market operations(OMOs) within an interest rate corridor bounded by the

Repurchase (Repo) rate and the Reverse Repurchase (Reverse

Repo) rate of the Central Bank. The Statutory Reserve

Requirement (SRR) was maintained at l0 per cent, while the

Bank Rate (the rate at which the Central Bank grants advances

to commercial banks) remained at 15 per cent per annum.G Monetary policy was tightened during 2005 with theobjective of containing the rapid growth of monetary andcredit aggregates and the burgeoning inflationary

pressures. The Central Bank's policy interest rates, viz. Repo

and Reverse repo rates, were raised by 125 basis points in four

steps in 2005:25 basis points in May, 50 basis points in June,

25 basis points in September and another 25 basis points inDecember. Simultaneously, OMOs were conducted

aggressively to absorb excess liquidity on a daily basis. These

measures were buttressed by outright sales of Treasury bills

held by the Central Bank, which sterilized the market liquidity

arisin-e from the purchases of foreign currency inflows to thegovernment by the Central Bank. However, to ensure theavailability of sufficient liquidity in the market, for urgent

expenditure in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster, the

absorption of excess liquidity through daily auctions under

OMOs was suspended temporarily from early January 2005,

OMOs were subsequently resumed in late February 2005 as the

threat of the tsunami on the financial sector and economic

acti vities gradually receded.G Monetary policy measures were instrumental in reducing

the excessive growth in money and credit aggregates and

arresting inflationary pressures in 2005. With the revision

of the Repo and Reverse Repo rates of the Central Bank to 8.75

per cent and 10.25 per cent, respectively, the interest rate

structure moved to a higher plateau resulting in an increase in

the cost of funds. At dailv OMO auctions conducted by the

114Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2005

Part IChapter 7 - MONETARY POLICY MONEY CREDIT AND INTEREST RATES

Central Bank, the weighted avera-ee Repo auction rate (i.e, the

effective policy rate) rose by 145 basis points in 2005. Call

money rates increased by 125 basis points, while the average

wei-ehted deposit rate (AWDR) and the aveta-se weighted

prime lending rate (AWPR) increased by 93 basis points and

201 basis points, respectively. Reserve money -{rowth, which

accelerated in2004, be,ean to decelerate -eradually throughout

2005 andby the end ofthe year, reached arate of 15.8 per cent,

marginally hi-eher than the target of l5 per cent. Broad money

expansion also decelerated towards the end of the year

responding positively to the tightening of monetary policy.

Inflation, as measured by the point to point increase in the

Colombo Consumers' Price Index (CCPI) peaked in February,at 15.9 per cent, and declined thereafter due to the

contractionary monetary policy as well as improved supply

conditions, and was 8.0 per cent in December 2005. The point-

to-point inflation as measured by the Sri Lanka Consumers'

Price Index (SLCPI) declined at a faster rate from 16.8 per cent

at end 2004to 3.6 per cent at end 2005.s The Central Bank continued to lay emphasis on the

transparency of monetary policy decision making and

communication, which is key to improving the effectiveness

of monetary policy. Accordingly, the Central Bank makes

public the monetary policy tar-{ets, with explanatory notes, at

the beginning of the year. The public was informed of the

decisions and factors considered at the regular monetary policy

reviews through press releases issued as per the advance release

calendar. The Central Bank also continued to make available

information on developments in relation to key macroeconomic

variables through media including its website, to enable market

participants as well as the general public to arrive at informed

decisions.s Efforts were also taken to strengthen monetary policy

transmission by improving the efficiency of the financial

system. The Payment and Settlement Systems Act was brought

in to improve the security, safety and efficiency of the payment

system and facilitate the smooth functioning of financial

markets. A number of regulatory measures were taken to

improve risk management, resilience, competition and the

efficiency of financial institutions. The amendments to the

Finance Leasing Act allowing leasing companies to securitise

leasing portfolios and measures taken to expand the govemment

securities trading and settlement mechanisms would help

promote the long term debt securities market.

7.3 Developments in Money and CreditAggregates

Money Market Liquiditys As high excess liquidity in the market could lead to an excessivemonetary expansion that could raise future inflationary

pressures, money market liquidity was maintained throughout

2005 at a desirable level to foster the ongoing economic

development, while containing demand pressures in the

economy.# However, in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami disaster,

the Central Bank implemented a relief package to ensure theavailability of adequate liquidity to facilitate the smooth

functioning of money and financial markets. The absorption of

excess liquidity tluough daily OMO auctions was discontinued

temporarily from 5 January 2005 till 21 February 2005. As

tsunami related financial inflows raised the level of liquidity in

the economy, OMOs were conducted aggressively, both on an

overni-eht basis and permanently, to mop up the entirety of

excess liquidity.

Reserve Money$ In 2005, the quarterly targets of reserve money were

achieved except in March. Reserve money continued to rise

above the targeted level till end March as a result of the high

demand for currency to finance tsunami related relief

operations. Compared with the growth rate of 20.9 per cent in

December 2004, teserve money rose by 15.8 per cent in

December 2005. This was only a marginal increase above the

target of l5 per cent set for December 2005.

The expansion in reserve money in 2005 was entirely

reflected in the increase in net foreign assets (NFA) of the

Central Bank. The build up of NFA was a result of the Central

Bank purchasing foreign culrency proceeds received by the

government. These consisted of tsunami related inflows, other

grants, loans from foreign donor agencies and domestic foreign

currency borrowin-es from Forei-En Currency Banking Units

(FCBUS).

The net domestic assets (NDA) of the Central Bank were

brought down through OMO to offset the increase in NFA

and contain the growth in reserve money. The decline in

Part IChapter 7 - MONETARY POLICY MONEY CREDITAND INTEREST RATES

NDA by Rs. l8 billion helped contain the increase in reserve

money to Rs. 26 billion in 2005. With the sterilisation of the

additional liquidity created by increased NFA, the Treasury bill

holdin-es of the Central Bank fell from Rs. 74 billion as at end

2004to Rs.35.6 billion as at end 2005. However, the provisional

advances to the government from the Central Bank rose by Rs.

5 billion in 2005.r In addition to the reduction in Treasury bill

holdings, the increase in the liabilities of the Central Bank by

about Rs.15 billion consequent to the appreciation of the rupee

in 2005. also contributed to the decline in NDA of the Central

Bank.o From the point of view of uses of money, the expansion in

reserye money was reflected in the increase in currency incirculation and commercial bank deposits. The deposits of

commercial banks with the Central Bank increased by Rs. 10.5billion while currency in circulation increased by Rs.l6.5billion. However, the growth in cunency declined reflectingpublic preference to move to interest bearin_q assets with the

increase in interest rates.

Narrow Money (M.,)e The narrow money supply (M,) consisting of currency anddemand deposits held by the public, increased by 22.4 per

cent in 2005, in comparison with the 16.6 per cent growth

in 2004. Currency held by the public increased by 14.4 per cent

(Rs. 14.4 billion) and demand deposits held by the public grew

by 31.4 per cent (Rs.27.8 billion).

1 The government is eligible to borrow up to 10 per cent of the estimated annualrevenue in lhe budget from the Central Bank by way of provisional advances.

Broad Money (Mro)s The higher expansion in broad money (Mro) in 2004

continued into most of 2005 but had begun to slow down byDecember 2005. This deceleration was in response to thetightening of monetary policy. During most of 2005, broad

money continued to -qrow by around 20-2I per cent, before it

declined to around 19 per cent by end December 2005. The

expansion in broad money was mainly reflected in a higher

increase in credit to the private and public sectors.s All components of M2b. r,iz, currency, demand deposits, andtime and savings deposits increased during 2005. Currency

held by the public increased by 14.4 per cent compared to the

16.4 per cent _erowth in 2004. This was due to the hightransaction demand for money arising from expanding

economic activities. Savings deposits grew by 13.0 per cent and

At the time of establishing the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in1950, the country had been using currency notes indenominations of Re. I and rupees2,5,l0, 50, 100, 500 and

1,000 and coins in denominations of cents 1,2, 5, 10, 25, 50

and Re. 1 issuedby the Board of Commissioners of Cunency.The Central Bank started to print its own currency notes indenominations of Re. I and rupees 2,5, 10,50, and 100 in195L152. Subsequently, a note of rupees 20 denomination

was introduced in 1979, followed by notes of rupees 500 and1,000, issued in 1981. Since then a note of a higherdenomination has not been issued.t

In a modern economy, in addition to currency notes andcoins, a variety of instruments is available for payments andsettlements. The most common instruments are cheques,credit cards, debit cards, and electronic means. Although the

use of cunency has been declining slowly in relative terms inmodern economies, it remains by far the most popularpayment instrument throughout the world. The demand forcurency increases due to increased volumes of transactions

and increases in prices.

When the value of transactions is increasing, the generalpublic seek more convenient modes of payments, in particularhigh value currency notes, to effect large value transactions.At the time when the high denomination rupees 1,000 note

cunency in circulation in terms of the highest denominationfell to 5.6 million notes. By 2005, this has again increased to

132.4 million notes, indicating the need for a note of an evenhigher denomination. Although the demand has increasedsharply, there has not been a note of a higher denominationto match the demand.There are several benefits as well as costs associatedwith the introduction of new higher denomination cunencynotes. The cunency denominations required for automatedteller machines (ATMs) are often found to be large valuenotes since it may not be economical to stock the machineswith small denominations. With the increase in the use ofATMs, there is an increased demand for high value notes assmall denominations increase the operating costs of banks.

The non-availability of non-cash payment facilities in remoteareas further increases the need for higher denominationcurrency notes. For example, high denomination notesincrease the convenience provided to tourists who wish to

purchase high value goods at rural or remote locations.Printing of higher denomination notes is more

economical, since the printing cost does not significantly varywith the denomination of the note. The cost savings arise not

only through the reduction in printing aluge number of lowerdenomination notes, but also through the increase in the life

span of higher value denomination notes, because of lowercirculation. In addition, the weighted average lifetime of theRs.1,000 and the Rs. 500 cutrency notes is about 6-7 years.

a very short average lifespan ofless than a year. Further, highvalue denominations help save time, particularly, in largevalue transactions, thus improving the efficiency of

transacIons.The risk of counterfeiting is more prominent in higher

denomination currency notes. It could provide a convenient

means for money laundering and underground economicactivities. However. these drawbacks can be addressed

.

effectively to a large extent by taking precautionary measures.

The risk of counterf'eiting could be reduced by the use of

advanced security features built into higher value notes and

increasing alertness of the public when accepting such notes.

This would require enhancement of public awareness through

appropliate measures. The cost of improved security featuresof high denominations would be marginal due to savings onpnnting cost,

time deposits grew by 23.6 per cent. This was in response to

the gradual increases in interest rates and the continued effortsof banks to attract more deposits through attractive schemes.

Foreign currency deposits also increased, by l7 per cent, which

could be attributed to the attractive interest rates offered by

banks on such deposits following the increase in interest rates

in major international markets.

Factors Affecting Broad Money (MrJ Growths The increase in both NDA and NFA of the banking systemcontributed to the expansion in broad money in 2005. The

higher contribution of 79 per cent was from NDA as a result of

the higher expansion in domestic credit.Credit to both the private and government sectorscontributed to the rise in NDA. However, the growth of 21.5

per cent in credit to the private sector accounted for 84 per centof the overall growth in broad money. Net credit to the

government grew by I1.9 per cent contributing 16 per cent to

the growth in broad money. The decline in credit to public

corporations by 59.5 per cent and the increase in other liabilities

of the banking system with the improvement in capital funds

helped contain the high expansion in broad money.

Credit to the private sector grew due to the fast recovery in

economic activities, which was aided by low real lendingrates and attractive credit schemes, specially consumercredit schemes promoted by banks. The dominant share of 9l

per cent of the credit expansion was accounted for by domestic

banking units, while the balance 9 per cent was from FCBUs.A major share of the increase in credit (21 per cent) was

absorbed by the commercial sector consisting of external and

domestic trade. This was followed by credit for consumption

(20 per cent) and housing ( I 7 per cent). The expansion in credit

to the private sector showed si-ens of deceleration towards the

end of the year. Since monetary policy works with a la-e, a

further deceleration is expected .

Net credit to the government (NCG) from the banking

system increased, but at a lower pace than in 2004. NCG

Charl7.3

Composition of Domestic Credit and Private Sector Credit Growth

from the banking sector increased by Rs. 26 billion in 2005

compared with the Rs.43 billion increase in2004. The increase

in NCG in 2005 was a net result of the increase in NCG from

commercial banks by Rs.60 billion and a decline in NCG from

the Central Bank by Rs. 33.7 billion. The govemment made use

of foreign currency loans from commercial banks to ease the

pressure on interest rates in the domestic market and to manage

its deficit financing. The increase in NCG from commercial

banks consisted of a net increase in FCBU loans by Rs. 43

billion, an increase in commercial bank holdings of government

securities by Rs, 19.6 billion, and an increase in overdraft

facilities granted to the government by commercial banks by

Rs, 6.3 billion. Provisional advances to the -qovernment by the

Central Bank increased by Rs.5 billion. However, the increase

in credit from the banking system moderated due to the decline

in the Central Bank's holdings of Treasury bills by Rs. 38

billion followin-e the sterilization of high rupee liquidity in the

market created by the increased forei-en cunency inf'lows.& Credit to public corporations declined substantially, by

Rs.24.5 billion, in 2005, mainly due to the arrangement of

two credit facilities by the government to import oil . About9l per cent of the decline in credit was due to the repayments

by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) to commercial

banks while the balance was due to the decline in credit to the

Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), Despite the surge in oil prices

in the international market, the CPC was able to settle about 95

per cent of its short-term liabilities to commercial banks

amounting to Rs.22 billion. This was made possible by thelong-term credit facility from India arranged by the

govemment, amounting to US dollars 150 million, to import oilfrom India in 2005, domestic price revisions and the

govemment subsidy to cover the losses of the CPC. In addition,

Iran also provided a shofi-term credit facility of US dollars 150million for oil imports, which was settled during the year.

Table 7.3

Source: Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Liabilities of the CEB to commercial banks also declined by

about Rs.2.7 billion, though its liabilities to other parties such

as the CPC and private power producers increased,c NFA of the banking system increased due to higher foreign

currency inflows to the government and the private sector.

These included tsunami related inflows and higher private

remittances. This increase was reflected in the build up of NFA

of the Central Bank, which increased by US dollars 501 million.

NFA of commercialbanks however, declined as the govemment

raised foreign currency loans from commercial banks and sold

the proceeds to the Central Bank, resulting in a compositional

shifi of these assets.

Financial Survey

The financial survey (Mo) is a broader measure of liquidity,which includes the assets and liabilities of licensed

specialised banks and finance companies in addition to theCentral Bank and licensed commercial banks, which are

covered in computing consolidated broad money (Mro).' The

-qrowth in broad money as measured by the financial survey (M.,)

was in a range of 17.7 - 19.8 per cent in 2005 compared to the

growth of 19.4 - 21.5 per cent in M,n durin-e 2005.

The growth in NCG based on the Frnancial survey was 15.6per cent compared to the 13.2 per cent growth in themonetary survey. Investments in government securities by

LSBs increased by Rs. 25 billion while investments by Finance

Companies also increased marginally. Meanwhile, credit to the

private sector as per the financial survey increased by 21.7 per

The contribution from LSBs, finance companies and RDBs tothe total credit expansion in Mn were Rs,l7 billion, Rs.l6billion and Rs.3 billion, respectively. Credit extended byfinance companies in 2005 indicated a substantial increase

when compared with the Rs.8 billion expansion recorded in

2004. This was largely due to the increase in credit facilities

provided for leasing and hire purchase.

7.4 lnterest Ratesc Market interest rates moved up in 2005 reflecting theincrease in the Central Bank's policy interest rates, thehigher demand for credit and inflation expectations. With

the moderation in inflation towards the second half of the year,

real interest rates that were low in many market segments in

2004 gradually increased. Interest rates applicable to foreigncurrency deposits and lending also increased following theupward revision of interest rates in several major foreign

economres.

Central Bank Policy Interest Ratess The Central Bank's policy interest rates, i.e., theRepurchase (Repo) and Reverse Repurchase (Reverse

R.po) rates, were gradually raised in 2005 reversing the lowinterest rate regime that prevailed from 2003 to November

2004. The upward adjustment of interest rates was wananted

as a measure to contain the higher than anticipated increase in

credit and other monetary aggregates as well as to anest nsinginflation and inflation expectations. The upward adjustment inpolicy interest rates commenced in November 2004 with an

increase in both the repo and reverse repo rates by 50 basispoints to 7.50 pel cent and 9.00 per cent, respectively, Durin_q

2005, the Central Bank _eradually tightened its monetary policy

stance by raising policy interest rates furtherby 125 basis points

banks do not make use of this facility, generally.

Money Market Ratesr Interest rates in the money market increased with thetightening of the monetary policy stance in 2005. The

weighted average yield rate at the daily Repo auctions, which

was 7.84 per cent at end 2W4, declined to 7.55 per cent at end

February, following the resumption of liquidity absorption

through daily OMO on 2l February. Aggressive OMOs by way

of permanent absorption reduced excess liquidity after March,

and the average yield rate at the daily OMO auction moved up.

The continuation of these measures and the adjustment ofpolicy rates led to the Repo auction rate moving gradually

closer to the middle of the interest rate conidor. It remained

around 9.29 per cent by end December 2005.* The movements in the OMO auction rate were reflected inother short-term rates as well. The Sri Lanka Inter Bank

Offered Rate (SLIBOR)t, declined in February and March

following the discontinuation of the OMO auctions. However,

the SLIBOR increased with the recommencement of daily

absorption through OMO auctions. A similar trend was

reflected in the average weighted call money market rate as

well. It declined from 9.73 per cent at end December 2004 to

7.61 per cent at end March 2005, its lowest level in 2005.

Thereafter, it increased gradually andreached 10.73 per cent by

end December 2005.

Deposit and Lending Rates. Both deposit and lending rates in the banking system

increasel during 2005. With the luger adjustment in deposit

rates, particularly fixed deposit rates, the interest spread ofcommercial banks, which is measured by the difference

between average interest income and average interest cost,

narrowed marginally in 2005, but still remains high.c The average weighted deposit rate (AWDR)4, increased

2004 to 9.25 per cent by end December 2005.

The Average Weighted Prime Lending Rate (AWPR)5 of

commercial banks declined at the beginning of the year but

increased thereafter. It declined from 10.23 per cent at end

2004 to 9.76 per cent in February 2005, with the decline inOMO auction rates and call market rates. Thereafter, it

increased gradually and reached 12.24 per cent in December

20f,5. Meanwhile, the average weighted lending rate (AWLR),

which is the average lending rate applicable to the entire loanportfolio of domestic banking units of commercial banks,

increased from 14.8 per cent in December 2W to 15.4 per cent

in December 2005. The interest rates on outstanding balances

in relation to credit cards, which are penal rates, increased from

a range of 2l - 33 per cent in December 2004 to a range of 29- 34 per cent by end December 2005.

Both deposit and lending rates of long term lendinginstitutions also moved up. However, lending ratesapplicable to housing loans of key long-term lendinginstitutions remained unchanged in 2005. The rates of

interest offered by National Savings Bank (NSB) for savings

deposits remained unchanged at 5 per cent, while its rate for one

year fixed deposits increased from 8 to 9 per cent. The NSB

continued to offer high rates of interest for special deposit

schemes targeted at senior citizens. The State Mortgage and

Investment Bank (SMIB) and the DFCC Bank also raised their

deposit rates during the year. Interest rates pertaining to housing

loans granted by NSB, SMIB and HDFC Bank remained

unchanged.

The Legal Rate and the Market Rate, which are identical in

value terms also increased. The Legal Rate and the Market

Recent International Monetary Pblicy MeaSuresBox 15

Many central banks around the world began to providemonetary policy stimulus in 2001 with the onset of adownturn in the global economy, exacerbated by thegeopolitical uncertaing, specially the terrorist attack on the

USA in }Wl. The historically low inflation environment thatprevailed in many industrial as well as emerging market

economies further rationalised the provision of monetarypolicy stimulus; As the economic growth momentum in thedomestic economies and abroad became firmed, and

concerns over piice stability with the emerging: signs:ofinflationary pressures and rising asset prices; a number of

central banks began to remove the policy stimulus gradually

, Among the advanced economies, the USA reduced itsmonetary policy accommodation gradually by raising the

federal funds rate by 375 basis points in l5 consecutive stepsduring the period from June 20}4to March 2006. The Bankof England, Reserve Bank of AuStralia and Bank of Canada

also raised their policy rates considering the demand pressuresreflected specially by rising asset prices. The EuropeanCentral Bank also raised its key policy interest rate (main

refinancing rate) in December 2005 after maintaining it athistorically low levels for two and a half years, Among Asian

economies, tightening monetary policies was adopted by theBank of Korea; Bank Negara Malaysia, Bank of Thailand, :from 2004.

7.5 Further Developments and MonetaryPolicy lssuess The Central Bank has taken several measures to improvemonetary management in the recent past. The market

orientation of monetary operations was further increased,

competition among market participants was further facilitated

and transparency in policy conduct was continued through

regular communications to the general public,s Monetary policy needs to be guided by morerepresentative price indices and indicators of inflation

expectations. Adopting a more representative inflation

measure to identify and quantify sources of inflationary

pressures, developing a core inflation measure that captures

demand pressure in the economy, conducting inflationexpectation surveys and developing forward Iooking

indicators are vital for the further improvement of monetarypolicy decision making and monetary operations. In this

context, preparation of the SLCPI without a time lag and the

acceptance of it as the official price index by the govemment

without further delay are imperative.

Yield Rates of Government SecuritiesMonetary policy transmission depends heavily on the

effrciency and stability of the financial system. Therefore, thefurther strengthening of measures to improve efficiency andresilience of the financial system, such as reducing theintermediation cost of banks, increasing capital funds and

further improvement of risk management, is needed.

The continuation of the fiscal consolidation process is vitalfor success in monetary management. In the absence of fiscalconsolidation, an excessive demand for resources would

increase the demand pressure in the economy, with ensuing

corresponding inflationary pressures. Counter-measures byway of monetary policy are expected, to reduce demand

pre ssures by raising the cost of borrowing for both the

government sector and the private sector. The objective of thegovernment is to continue fiscal adjustments gradually.

However, any delays and/or reversal in fiscal consolidationwould affect moving toward an inflation targeting monetarypolicy framework. Thus, the current efforts in fiscal

consolidation need to be accelerated to enhance the efficacy of

monetary policy.
