ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

3.1 Overviews An efficient and developed economic and socialinfrastructure base across all geographic regions is vital forcreating opportunities for rapid economic growth,employment generation and poverty alleviation. Primaryeconomic infrastructure facilities are transpoft, telecommuni-cations, energy and other utilities such as water supply. Themain social infrastructure services are education, health and

safety nets.e The modern era is characterised by an intensificationof demand for high quality infrastructure services byboth domestic and international sectors. Domesticdemand arises from continuing economic growth and therenewed efforts at enhancing regional economic growth.

Increasing globalisation and the rapid growth in the SouthAsian region have increased international demand for highquality infrastructure services from Sri Lanka.Furthermore, the gradual deepening of globalisation hasraised demand for greater liberalisation of services,especially from countries seeking greater market accessfor the supply of services such as Business ProcessOutsourcing (BPOs), health, education and professional

services.o Infrastructure facilities have been expanding in the countrybut they are not adequate or competitive yet, therebyconstraining economic growth. The adequacy and the qualityof services provided by public enterprises in the areas of

el ectri ci ty generation, transmi ssion and di stributi on, passen-qer

transportation and water supply leave much to be desired. Many

essential services, such as healthcare and education are to some

extent, even obtained from abroad by Sri Lankans, The country

has the potential to develop these service sectors and turn them

around to be significant foreign exchange eamers. Nevertheless,infiastructure facilities in the liberalised service sectors such asports and telecommunications have demonstrated improved

performance and an ability to face competition.* Many state owned infrastructure related institutionscontinue to incur large operational losses despite beingmonopolies in essential sectors. Inability to implementrealistic prici ng poli cies, low productivi tyleffi ciency, pri nc ipal

1. ThePrincipal AgentProblemoccurswhenthemanagersincontrol (theagents) actin their own interesl ralher than the interest of the owners (the principals), due lodifferent set of incenlives

systems and political interference are the major reasons for the

lacklustre performance of state institutions. In the absence ofproper pricing and regulatory systems, natural resources are

being exploited in an unsustainable manner. Principal agent

problems and rent seeking lead to lower quality and inadequateproduction of services. The ineffectiveness of regulations and

undesirable political interference aggravate these problems.

Therefore, a renewed effort has to be made to introduce the

necessary reforms in the infrastructure service sector of the

economy.o Recognising these weaknesses, the government has taken

measures to enhance the supply of infrastructure servicesthrough the continuing liberalisation and strengthening ofpublic sector institutions. Accordingly, current reforms are

focused on introducing institutional reforms, promoting public-private partnerships, improving competition, freeing public

enterprises from political interference and enhancing theiraccountability, establishing appropriate pricing mechanisms

and strengthening regulations. In line with this policy focus, the

Strategic Enterprise Management Agency (SEMA) continuedto monitor strategic public institutions.2 Decisions have been

taken to implement the Upper Kotmale hydropower plant and

a coal power plant. Institutionalchanges have been introducedin the transport sector by re-establishing Sri Lanka Railways

and the Sri Lanka Transport Board. Maga Negwna and Ganm

Negunta programmes have been introduced to improve rural

infrastructure. The implementation of the key recommendations

made by the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on Health in 1997continued within the framework of the National Health

Development Master Plan. The reforms introduced in relation

to education in 1999 continued, aiming at improving educationinfrastructure, enhancing quality and reducing regional

disparities. Further, under the National Council for Economic

Development (NCED), clusters have been formed to look into

issues pertainin-e to telecommunications, renewable energy,

transportation, health and education, with a view to promoting

development through collective and collaborative efforts by all

stakeholders.

Government Investment in Infrastructureand healthy competition. In contrast, the postal services

recorded a sluggish grorvth in the absence of reforms.The reforms introduced since 1981 have made

telecommunications one of the most liberal, competitive andfast growing infrastructure services in the country.

Vigorous competition was seen among 3 fixed access telephone

operators, 4 mobile telephone operators, 32 external gateway

operators, 29 data communication and Internet service

providers, 4 pagin-e operators, 2 payphone operators and 2 trunk

radio operators. Durin-g the year, the sector continued to derive

benefits from the opening of the extemalgateway operations in2003. As a result, international connectivity improved

remarkably and charges were reduced significantly, benefitin-eboth domestic and corporate consumers. The subscriber

network of the telecommunications sector expanded by 45 per

cent in 2005 with the fixed access network growing by 26 per

cent and mobile telephone subscribers _erowin_e by 54 per cent.

The introduction of CDMA technology supported the growth

in fixed access network. CDMA technology has narrowed the

urban rural disparity in access to telephone services. Mobile

telephone penetration (the share of mobile phones in the total

number of telephones) in the telecommunications sector further

increased to 73 per cent in 2005 from TIper cent in 2004,

benefi ti n g from i mproved technology, a-q gressive competiti on,

affordability, quick connectivity and large coverage. With these

developments, the national telephone density (telephones per

100 persons) for fixed access telephones increased from 5. I to

6.3, while total telephone density including cellular phones

increased from 16.4 to23.6 in 2005. Subscribers to Internet and

e-mail services increased by 23 per cent in 2005.

Several telecommunications projects were in progress in

2005 to further expand telecommunication facilities in thecountry. Construction of a submarine cable system between

India and Sri Lanka was initiated in September 2005. Sri Lankawill be able to secure fast telecommunications connectivity at

cheaper rates with India and other SAARC countries with the

commissionin-e of this submarine cable system in 2006. TheSEA-ME-WE IV (South East Asia-Middle East - West

Europe-lV) submarine cable project was commissioned in 2005with l5 international partners. This would enhance the quality

and bandwidth of Sri Lanka's telecommunication services. SriLanka Telecom (SLT) was the local partner of both these

projects. In addition, mobile telephone operators implemented

several projects to up-erade and expand their services.

SriLanka has the potential to further develop Informationand Communication Technology (ICT) related seryices.

Given the hi-eh level of literacy in Sri Lanka, there is potential

to further develop information technology based services for

overseas and domestic clients such as BPOs, telemarketin-e, call

centres, data processin,e and internet based products.

a Performance of infrastructure services was mixed in 2005.Telecommunication services _qrew remarkably in 2005

supported by the introduction of Code Division Multiple Access(CDMA) technology and the rapid expansion of mobiletelephones. Port services recorded a significant _erowth with

increased international trade, tsunami related imports andimproved productivity. The electricity and petroleum sectorssuffered from historically high oil prices. The passengertransportation services operated by the state owned buscompanies have expanded marginally with the addition of anew fleet of buses, but the performance of Sn Lanka Railwaysindicated a setback durin-e 2005. Air transportation has showna modest -qrowth amidst increasing fuel prices and a slowgrowth in tourism. Domestic air services expandedsi-enificantly. In the education sector, 15,000 universitygraduates and 3,706 students who had completed theireducation at National Colleges of Education were recruited asteachers. Two new state universities, the Uva WellassaUniversity and the University of the Visual and PerformingArts, were established in 2005. In the health sector, the numberof hospital beds increased by about 3 per cent and the numberof doctors in the public health service increased by 4 per centin 2005. The housing market expanded further in response to

developments in the real estate and financial markets and risin_s

income levels.

3.2 Economic lnfrastructure Policies,Institutional Set up and Performance

Communications Servicess The telecommunications and postal services are the twomajor communications services operating in the country.These complement and compete with each other. Thetelecommunications service has become one of the fastest

. The traditional postal services are increasingly challenged

by rapid developments in ICT and emerging private postal

and courier services. The postal infrastructure in the country

represents one of the largest networks in the services sector with

over 4,000 state sector post offices located throughout the

country. With appropriate reforms and the incorporation of

developments in ICT, the postal sector has the potential for

developing into a modem system to deliver a better service with

a multitude of products such as agency functions relating to

financial and insurance and data ffansfer. The delavs in reforms

required for modernisation will result in further weakening thequality of services, a loss of market share to other competing

services and the continuation of operational losses. These losses

would add to the already high fiscal burden. In 2005, the total

operating expenditure of the Department of Posts (DOP) grew

sf ightly to Rs 4,298 million. Its revenue collection was

Rs. 2,@4 million. Consequently, its operating loss amounted

to Rs,1,654 million in 2005.

Energy

Major energy sources in Sri Lanka are biomass, hydro

electricity and petroleum. Biomass contributes to 47 per cent

of the total energy requirement, followed by petroleum (45 per

cent) and hydro electricity (8 per cent). The contribution from

alternate energy sources such as solar power and wind poweris insignificant. The share of petroleum in the total energy

supply has been rapidly increasing from32 per cent in 1996 to

around 45 per cent in 2005 as a result of the increasing demand,

the slow growth in hydropower generation and slow adoption

of alternate energy sources.

Electricity: The installed capacity for electricity generation

increased moderately in 2ffi5 but fell short of the demandfor electricity, which is growing at 8-10 per cent annually.

The installed capacity, which expanded by 3 per cent to 2,407MW was the combined effect of the commissioning of power

plants by the private sector, the 100 MW thermal power plant

at Embilipitiya and 5 mini hydropower plants with a total

capacity of 7 MW. Consequently, thecomposition of the power

system was as follows: 1,287 MW (54 per cent) of hydropower,l,l 15 MW (46 per cent) of thermal power and 5 MW of other

sources. To meet the growing demand, the elecricity generating

capacity has to be augmented by around 200 MW per annum.

Although a serious power shortage is not expected in 2006,

assuming normal weather conditions, the supply of electricity

is at risk since there are no major power generating projects to

be completed in 2006 and2007. The demand for electricity ison the increase; both domestic and general purpose

consumption grew by I I per cent, while industrial sector

consumption grew by 8 per cent.

Supply of electricity grew by 7.4 per cent to8,766 GWh in

2005. Hydro electricity generation grew by 17 per cent and

thermal power generation grew by l6 per cent in 2005. The

share of hydropower in total electricity generation increased to

39 per cent in 2005 from 37 per cent in 2004, due to higher

rainfall in catchment areas, particularly during the latter pafi of

the year. The share of thermal power generation declined to 6l

per cent in 2005. The share of the private sector in power

generation that has been rising, grew to 39 per cent in 2005

while the share of electricity generated by the CEB declined to6l per cent.

s The long-term sustainability of the electricity sector is being

threatened by delays in implementing new low cost power

plants, the non-implementation of necessary reforms and

the delay in addressing the high system losses. Considerable

delays in the implementation of the already planned powerprojects such as the combined cycle power plant at

Kerawalapitiya (300 MW), the frrst phase of the coal power

plant (300 MW) and the UpperKotmale hydropower plant (150

MW) could threaten the provision of an unintemrpted power

supply in the future. The average fuelcost of the CEB increasedby 19 per cent in 2005 due to the compounded effect of higher

oil prices and heavy reliance on thermal power generation. This

has led to the further erosion of the financial position of the

CEB, burdening the govemment, as electricity tariffs remained

unchanged in 2005. Electricity tariffs remain unchanged sinceApril 2002 despite sharp increases in petroleum prices. Efforts

to raise tariffs by 3.5 per cent in 2003 and increase the fixed

chargeby about l00percentin2005 were unsuccessful dueto

protests by consumers. The proposed increase in the fixed

charges is to be implemented from early 2006. In 2005, the

average cost of production was Rs.10.35 per unit, However, the

average tariff was Rs.7.70 per unit leading to a significant loss

to the CEB. However, the existing tariff is high compared withtariff in other countries. The losses of the CEB have increased

further due to the use of high cost short-term power plants

operating in some parts of the country and high system losses

of the CEB, which increased to 17.3 per cent from 17.1 per cent

a year ago. According to provisional accounts, the net operating

loss of the CEB increased by 49 per cent to Rs.l6 billion during2005. Short-term liabilities and payment arrears of the CEBhave increased further. Short-term borrowings from

commercial banks and payment anears to the Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation (CPC) and Independent Power Producers (IPP)

amounted to Rs.26 billion at the end of 2005. In addition,

payment arrears and future payment obligations on CEB's long-

term loans, amounted to Rs.53 billion by end December 2005.

The initial proposal to restructure the power sector by

unbundling of the CEB has been revised. Unbundling of theCEB by creating two power generation companies, one

transmission company and five distribution companies was

proposed in the Electricity SectorReforms Act No.28 of 2002.

This structure was modified as per the Power Sector Concept

Paper, presented to the Cabinet in July 2005, taking into

consideration proposals made by trade unions. Under the

proposed reforms, the power sector would be regulated by the

Public Utilities Commission of SriLanka (PUCSL) established

in 2003.

Petroleum: The domestic petroleum sector was seriouslyaffected by the historically high oil prices in 2005.

Expenditure on petroleum imports increased by 37 per cent to

US dollars 1,655 million in 2005 driven by an equal increasein prices. Domestic petroleum prices were not adjusted

monthly as per the pricing formula, but some adjustments were

made in May and June 2005 raising petrol, diesel and kerosene

prices by 18 per cent, 19 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively.

The delayed and inadequate adjustments in prices caused a

significant financial strain on petroleum distributing companies,

the CPC and Lanka IOC Ltd (LIOC), compelling them to claim

subsidies amounting to Rs. 26 billion (about I per cent of GDP)

in 2005 from the government. To limit its impact on the general

price level, the -eovernment removed the 15 per cent VAT on

diesel with effect from Aueust 2005.

The demand for major petroleum products (petrol, dieseland kerosene) increased by 3 per cent in 2005, incomparison to a 10 per cent increase in 2004. The largestpetroleum use in Sri Lanka is for transport (50 per cent),followed by power generation (25 per cent) and industries,

households and other sectors (25 per cent). The growth of petrol

consumption further decelerated to 6 per cent in 2005 tiom I I

per cent a year a-Qo respondin_{ to the price increases durin_e theyear. Auto diesel sales dropped by I I per cent mainly due to the

increased use of fulnace oil for power generation and increased

hydropower -qeneration, parliculally durin_e the latter part of the

year. The demand for kerosene increased marginally in 2005.

The financial position of the CPC improved in 2005 due toprogress made in frnancial management, internal controland external financial support, but its medium termIiabilities have increased. The establishment of a Treasury

Management Unit in 2001 helped rationalise the loan portfolio

of the CPC thereby reducing finance cost, facilitatin,e the importof refined products on a more competitive basis and enablin_ethe CPC to negotiate more favourable terms for suppliers'credit. The government arranged an extended suppliers creditfacility from Iran for a period of six month; up to a maximumlimit of US dollars 150 million in 2005. The CPC used thisfacility entirely during the first half of 2005 and commenced

repayment during the second half. The government has also

anan-{ed a long-term credit facility of US dollars 150 million

under the Indian Line of Credit to import refined petroleumproducts from India, which is lepayable in seven yearsincluding a grace period of one year. The CPC used upto USdollars I44 million of this facility in 2005 and repayment is to

commence from April 2006. These facilities improved theliquidity position of the CPC, reducing short-term advancestaken from commercial banks to very low levels, but its

s Since petroleum would become a very scarce resource in thefuture, a long-term strategy for the energy sector should beprepared. In this respect, developing altemate energy sources

such as coal power, as well as renewable energy sources such

as wind power, solar power, dendro power and hydropowerwould be important. The govemment has reco-enised this needin its new ener_qy policy, which is bein-e drafted. At the same

mass transport systems and the development and maintenanceof an efficient road network. Developing a mass transport

system will not only reduce the use of private vehicles, thereby

saving energy, but also assist environmental protection.r According to recent seismic surveys, there exists a highprobability of Sri Lanka having oil in its off-shore areas in

the Wctern and North-Western regions. Sri Lanka has made

several attempts at oilexploration since the 1970s. The cunentattempt at oil exploration commenced in 2001. Several

hydro-carbon location surveys were carried out with donor

assistance. These surveys disclose a high likelihood of finding

hydro-carbon deposits in off-shore areas of the Western and

North-Western regions. In view of rising oil prices in theinternational market, the Sri Lankan government has taken

several steps to expedite oil exploration activities. The

necessary legal and institutional framework has already been

set up.

Transportationr Transportation is a vital component of economicinfrastructure, having strong linkages to economic and

social development by providing access to input and outputmarkets as well as to public services throughout the

country. The transport network comprises highways, bus routes

and railways, shipping network and air transportation. Airtransport and maritime transport are used mostly for

international and regional transport. In Sri Lanka, the transport

sector contributes about 8 per cent to the GDP.

Road Transport. Road Development: Roads in Sri Lanka are in need ofsignificant improvements in quality. They are in a poorcondition mainly due to the lack of regular maintenance,

excessive delays in implementing planned projects of road

construction and rehabilitation and insufficient funds. The RoadDevelopment Authority (RDA) is responsible for thedevelopment of the national road network. The RDA

maintained 1L,694 kilometres of trunk roads (A class) and main

roads (B class) and 4,429 bridges in 2005. It has spent Rs.14billion in 2005, a 26 per cent increase over 2004, for the

maintenance, rehabilitation and reconstruction of national

roads. Provincial and Local governments maintain about I 5,000

kilometres of provincial roads (C and D classes) and 75,000

kilometres of local roads (E class). The lack of funds is more

severe in the case of local and provincial governments. This has

led to a low level of rural and provincial road maintenance.i During 2005 the RDA continued to implement several

highway projects. The Southem Highway, the Colombo Outer

Circular road and the Colombo - Kandy expressway were the

major road projects. The Southern expressway with a total

length of 130 kilometres is funded by the ADB and the JBIC.The construction work of the ADB funded section

(Kurundugahahetepma-Matara, Godagama) commenced inApril 2003 and by end 2005 over 50 per cent of the

construction work had been completed. This section of the roadwill be completed by September2007. The construction work

of the JBIC funded section (Kottawa-Kurundugahahetepma)

commenced in August 2005 and is expected to be completed by

August 20W. The Colombo Outer Circular Highway, with an

estimated project cost of Rs. 33.5 billion, is exPected to be

implemented with frnancial assistance of JICA. The feasibilitystudy of the Colombo-Kandy expressway has been

completed with assistance from SIDA and is expected to beimplemented on a BOT basis with the assistance of the

Malaysian Government at an estimated cost of Rs. 29 billion.The Baseline Road Phase III extension project is to be

implemented with financial assistance from the JBIC. The land

acquisition for it is in progress. The estimated project cost is

Rs.4.6 billion.

The RDA implemented several road rehabilitation,

maintenance and improvement projects funded by foreign

sources. The Road Network Improvement Project funded by

the ADB is in progress to rehabilitate 345 kilometres of roads

and 47 bridges at a cost of US dollars 80 million. Further, the

JBIC funded Road Sector Development Project, the World

Bank funded Road Sector Assistance Project (RSAP) and Small

Scale Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Upgrading Project

(SSIRUP), the ADB funded Flood Damage hoject andConflictAffected Area Rehabilitation Project (CAARP) were inprogress in 2005. The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic

Development provided a loan (Kuwait Dinar 5.1 million) to

reconstruct 32 bridges. The rehabilitation and improvement ofthe Balangoda-Beragala-Bandarawela road with financial

assistance from Korea, is also in progress.

The'Maga Neguma' programme commenced in 2(X)4 with

the objective of developing feeder roads in rural areas. Theprogramme is funded through budgetary allocations andreimbursable foreign aid. The Ministry of Highways is the

executing agency. Under the Maga Neguma programme, 731

kilometres of rural roads were improved through 1,299 projects

at a cost of Rs.432 million in 2005.

The first phase of the rehabilitation of tsunami affectedroads was completed. The tsunami disaster damaged 415kilometres of roads in four provinces. These roads wererepaired to a passable condition in 2005 and are to berehabilitated under the Sri Lanka Tsunami Affected Areas

Recovery and Takeoff Project (STAART) funded by the JBIC.

In the absence of suffrcient budgetary resources or donorfunds, Sri Lanka needs to look at alternate models of roaddevelopment. Some development models advocate theestablishment of a Road Development Fund for road

maintenance, the raising of funds from the capital market fornew construction and should encourage BOO/BOT

arrangements for new road constructions.

Road Passenger Transport: Passenger transportationcontinued to be dominated by bus passenger transportationbut the share of private modes of transportation is on theincrease. Public road passenger transport, measured in termsof passenger kilometres, contributes 68 per cent of the totalpassenger transportation in Sri Lanka, while Sri LankaRailways contribute 5 per cent and private and hired vehicleowners contribute the balance 27 per cent.In 2005, there was a decline in the performance ofpassenger transportation, as indicated by the operatedkilometres and passenger kilometres. The total operatedkilometres of the state and the private sector operators declinedby 4 per cent, while passenger kilometres declined by 3 per

cent, over 2004.

The quality of road passenger transportation showed nosignificant improvement in 2005. Although Sri Lanka has asatisfactory bus transport network and vehicle fleets,shortcomings that have prevailed during the last few decadescontinued to loom large. Inadequate services, poor quality, anincreasing number of accidents and weak enforcement ofregulations were some of the weaknesses of the public road

transport service. In addition, state owned bus services sufferedfrom a shortage of operational buses, a deterioration of revenue,cost escalation due to the excessive work force, managementdeficiencies, a unionised labour force, inadequate workingcapital and low investment. As a result, state owned busservices are running at a large loss and are heavily dependenton govemment assistance.

The Sri Lanka Central Transport Board (SLCTB) wasreestablished to strengthen the state owned passenger busservice. Accordingly, the operations of all the Cluster BusCompanies (CBCs) have been brought under SLCTB, whichmanages a registered fleet of 8,649 buses though the actualaverage number of buses operated per day was only 3,808(about 44 per cent). Steps have been taken to augment theoperational bus fleet through new purchases under the IndianLine of Credit, donations received from Japan and by repairingnon-operational buses.

In keeping with the national policy on fare revisions, busfares were raised by 10 - 20 per cent from June 2005. The

increase in price of diesel by Rs. 6.00 per litre and the escalationof other operating costs were the main reasons for this fareincrease. Consequently, the total revenue of SLCTB in 2005increased by 37 per cent to Rs. 10,806 million. However, as

total expenditure increased by I I per cent to Rs. 12,682 million,SLCTB reported an operating loss of Rs. 1,876 million in 2005.

Railway Transportation: Sri Lanka Railways (SLR)operating with a number of limitations has not been able tooffer high quality services and achieve financialsustainability. The SLR operates on 1,200 kilometres of rrack

out of the total len-eth of 1,445 kilometres due to the closure of

several sections in the war ravaged areas of the North and theEast. However, about 50 per cent of the operational track

remains below the minimum standards and 30 per cent is being

operated under strict speed restrictions. A large part of the

signalling and communication system is obsolete and subject

to frequent failures thereby disrupting the services. The rollingstock position of SLR is inadequate to provide a sarisfactory

service, with only I 19 locomotives as against the minimumrequirement of 162 locomotives. SLR needs at least 900

coaches, but it possesses only 500 coaches, of which 75 per cent

has been in operation for over 15 years. As a result, the shareof SLR in passenger and freight traffrc has declined to 5 per centand2 per cent, respectively, from 8 per cent and 4 per cent,respectively, a decade ago. The quality of services provided bySLR has suffered and its financial position has weakened dueto several major drawbacks such as rigidities in pricing,institutional weaknesses and frequent labour disputes. Theoperational losses have hindered the development of railway

tracks, not permitted the strengthening and maintenance of therolling stock or the other operational systems and forced SLRto depend heavily on continued budgetary support ofa large

magnitude.

The performance of SLR showed a further setback in 2005.

The operated kilometerage dropped slightly to7.6 million kmin 2005, while passenger kilometres dropped by 7 per cenr to4,358 million km. The decline in operations is partly

attributable to the closure of the Southern line for a few months

after the tsunami. However, the revenue of SLR increased by

17 per cent to Rs.1,958 million in 2005 due to the upwardrevision of rail fares in August 2005. The operating expenditure

increased by 26 per cent to Rs.5,463 million, mainly due to theincreased fuel cost, salaries and wages. Consequently, the

increase in the operating loss by 32per cent to Rs.3,505 million

exerted a heavy burden on the budget.

The SLR prepared a strategic action plan in 2005 tooyercome its limitations.The Department of Sri LankaRailways was re-established in January 2005, abandoningpreviously envisaged reforms under the Railway Authority.Accordingly, SLR prepared a strategic plan for 2005,

highlighting cadre requirements and recruitment of consultancy

servi ces for cost accountancy, property management, marketi n g

and sales. However, it is necessary to free SLR from prohibitiveadministrative and financial regulations and permit it tofunction as a commercial venture, as a prelude to any

restructuring pro,qramme. It is proposed to extend the KelaniValley railway line up to Hambantota via Ratnapura andEmbilipitiya and the Southern coastal line up to Kataragama,and to built a new railway line linking Kurunagala and

Habarana via Dambulla.

National Transport CommissionCivil Aviation Authority of Sri LankaSriLankan Airlines

o Civil Aviation: The civil aviation sector has grown

signiflrcantly in recent years, owing to reforms, the benign reconomic environment and the ceasefire agreement. TheCivil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka (CAASL) wasestablished in2002 in order to give greater flexibility for

decision making, in place of the Department of CivilAviation.Vital changes were made in the civil aviation sector thereafter,leading to deregulation, and the adoption of bilateralliberalisation agreements to attract more international cariersand tourists to the country. As a result, the number of

intemational passenger airlines operating in Sri Lanka increased

to 33 by 2005 from 27 in2000.In 2005, three domestic airlineswere permitted to operate services to India while Indian

domestic private carriers were permitted to operate services toSriLanka.s International air passenger and freight transportationcontinued to improve despite the slow down in touristarrivals. During 2005, 33 international airlines, including 3

cargo airlines, operated in Sri Lanka, compared to 32 airlines

and 3 cargo airlines op€rating in the previous year. The number

of air passengers passin-q through the Bandanaike Intemational

Airport (BIA) increased by 5 per cent compared to the 25 per

cent increase in 2004. Freight transportation, excludin-e tsunami

related freight, increased by 9 per cent compared to the 18 per

cent increase in the previous year. The share of the national

carrier, Srilankan Airlines, in terms of passengers and freighttransportation, increased by l6 per cent and 14 per cent

respectively, in 2005. The new passenger terminals and bridges

at the BIA facilitated the handling of an increased number of

passengers and provided an improved service to passengers.

The performance of domestic air transportation alsoimproved in 2ffi5. The number of passengers transported by

the three domestic airlines increased by l0 per cent to 63,673.

The domestic air services operated mainly to Jaffna. Air taxi or

water aerodromes operated by Srilankan airlines expanded

further in 2005, providing services to new destinations such asBenthota, Nuwara-Eliya and Kandy during the year. The

CAASL is considering permitting aviation related recreational

activities such as Ballooning, Para Gliding and the operation ofUltra Light aircraft in the country.

Sri Lanka faces several challenges to harness its strategicgeographical advantage to become a hub in the region.

Insuffi ci en t infrastruc ture, inadequate anci I lary services, poor

road transportation, insufficient accommodation, the lack of an

alternate airport and policy deficiencies are among the major

constraints. Unless those weaknesses are addressed, there is a

risk of losing a considerable share of air traffic to other airports

in the region. To further develop infrastructure, the govemment

has decided to build a second international airport at Weerawilawith a view to providing another major airport as per

international aviation nonns.

Port Services: Port services continued to expand benefitingfrom increased international trade, capacity expansion andproductivity improvements. The performance of all fourports, at Colombo, Galle, Trincomalee and Kankasanturei,

increased in 2005. Total cargo handling, including container

handling, recorded a l0 per cent growth in 2005, following the

I I per cent growth in 20M. Total container handling increased

by I I per cent to 2.5 million Twenty-foot Equivalent Container

Units (TEUs) in 2005. Of the totalcontainerhandling, abour 70

per cent was transhipments, which grew by l2per cent in 2005.The container handling capacity at the Port of Colombo

increased by 250,000 TEUs per year with the opening of the

Unity ContainerTerminal (UCT) in June 2004. Productivity in

respect of cargo handling at the Port of Colombo also improved

to around 25-30 gantry moves per hour from aroun d 20-25 afew years ago, due to the use of better technology and

equipment and improved human resources management.

The number of ships arriving at Sri Lanka's ports increasedby 7 per cent to 4,140 in 2005. The number of main vesselscanying containers increased by 4 per cent, while the numberof feeder vessels increased by 34 per cent. The number ofconventional ships arriving at Sri Lanka's ports in 2005declined as car-qo transportation is increasingly done incontainerised form, as the latter method is more economical,faster and safer.

Steps are being taken to further expand the capacity andefficiency of the Port of Colombo to meet increasingdemand and to face emerging regional competition. Theexpansion of the Jaye Container Terminal (JCT) was initiatedby the Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA) in 2005 to enhance thecapacity of the Port of Colombo to accommodate megacontainer ships. The completion of this project, will facilitatehandling of two 8,000 TEUs container ships simultaneously atJCT III and IV. The implementation of the proposed ColomboSouth harbour, without further delay, is crucial to face regionalcompetition. The initial cost of constructing the three kilometrelong breakwater has been estimated to be US dollars 300million. The ADB has commitred US dollars 150 million forthis purpose. The Colombo South Harbour will accommodatebigger container vessels with a draft of l6 metres and will have

three terminals each of 1,200 metres in length, which are to bedeveloped by the private sector. Construction work has to becommence this year (2W6) for the port to be ready to handle

mega ships that are expected by 2009.

Regional port development has also been given priority inthe context of the government effort to reduce regionaldisparities. Under the regional port development programme,the Port of Galle would be developed with a l2 metre deepmulti-purpose berth and an outer port to facilitate tourism, withfinancial assistance from JBIC. The proposed Port of

Hambanthota is to be developed as a bunkering centre. The Porlof Trincomalee willbe developed as a'port city', focusing onthe development of tourism, as well as providing services toregional industries.

The Port of Colombo has satis{ied US security requirementsunder the Container Security Initiative (CSD. The Port ofColombo became the 42"d port to comply with the CSI, whichfacilitates US bound containers to be scanned for weapons ofmass destruction. The port also complies with the Mega portinitiative to detect nuclear or radioactive material in shipmentsto the USA. These measures were required as the USA isplanning to deal only with CSI compliant ports. Further, thiswill improve efficiency of cargo clearing, and preclude the needfor re-examination.

Port services continued to face new challenges due toemerging regional competition, mainly from the new portsdeveloped in the Middle East and South India. Thetechnological advancements that contribute to the efficiency ofport services are taking place at a rapid pace and any port that

is oblivious to those developments is bound to be pushed backby competitors. Hence, any plan to develop port servicesshould take cognisance of the future requirements rather than

concentrate on current tssues.

Water Supply and lrrigation. The provision of water for drinking and irrigation on asustainable basis is a national priority. Achieving

sustainability requires economising on the usage, appropriatepricing to prevent wastage and over exploitation and attainingpublic consensus through awareness on the need for reachingsustainability. Two major factors threatening the long-termsustainability of water resources in Sri Lanka are improperpricing and deficiencies in regulation. Pipe borne drinking

water is subject to a price, with a subsidy segment, but other

forms of water supply are not subject to any pricing, Ieading to

possible over exploitation and inefficient utilisation. In this

connection, only a few regulations exist in respect of the use of

natural aquifers and other forms of water resources, threatening

their long-term sustainability.t One of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set by

the United Nations requires that all citizens in a country

should access safe drinking water and adequate sanitationfacilities by 2015. In Sri Lanka, 92 per cent of the population

had access to safe drinking water in 2005, of which only 39 per

cent had access to pipe borne water. The National Water Supplyand Drainage Board (NWSDB) has estimated that the

investment requirements of the water supply sector up to 2010would be Rs,140 billion, However, the average annual

investment by the government in the water supply sector in the

last five years was around Rs.8 billion. This indicates that

altemative funding sources need to be tapped in order to reach

the targets set with regard to the supply of water.rl The NWSDB further expanded its activities in 2005. The

water tariff was raised in 2005 after three years. Total water

production by NWSDB increased by 4 per cent to 383 million

cubic metres. The numberof water supply projects managed byNWSDB increased marginally to29l during the year, while the

number of new water connections increased by 13 per cent to

66,117 .In view of the considerable growth in the cost of water

production and distribution in recent years, a tariff revision was

made effective from March 2005. The main objective of the

revision was to recover the increased cost of water production.3

The tariff increase is also aimed at reducin-{ existing cross

subsidies and motivating people to conserve water.s The NWSDB earned an operating profit in 2005 and

implemented several water projects using both local andforeign funds. The total revenue of NWSDB increased by 27per cent to Rs.6,218 million in 2005, largely driven by the

expansion of the consumer network and the upward revision oftariff. Its operating expenses increased by I I per cent to

and 14 foreign funded projects. The Secondary Towns Water

Supply and Sanitation Project, Water Treatment Plant Project

on the right bank of the Kelani river and the Third Water Supply

and Sanitation Project are Some of the major foreign funded

water supply projects implemented in 2005.l The NWSDB faces a serious loss from unaccounted water.

In distributin-{ water, the Board faces a total loss of about 3l per

cent while the loss is more acute in the Greater Colombo Area

(36 per cent). This situation impacts adversely on its revenue

and investment.G The Department of Irrigation is responsible for theimplementation and maintenance of irrigation systems.

Dunng 2005, the Department of lrrigation spent Rs.750 million

on the rehabilitation of existing inigation projects and canal

systems. In 2005, the Department canied out two major foreign

funded projects, Deduruoya and Weheragala reservoirs. TheDepartment continued to implement the '10,000 tankprogramme' (Dahasak Maha Wew programme) in 2005 and

246 tanks were renovated at a cost of Rs.205 million in 2005.. The maintenance of large reservoirs requires urgentattention. Although successive governments have invested

large amounts of funds in the construction of reservoirs, major

inigation networks and in land development, attention paid to

maintenance has not been adequate in the past. The lack of

proper maintenance will not only results in an increase in the

cost of maintenance in the future substantially, but would also

lead to underutilisation and the potential risk of structural

failures.

3.3 Social Infrastructure Policies,Institutional Set up and PerformanceG Sri Lanka has already achieved the Millennium

Development Goals in several social development areas, butfurther progress in this respect is urgently required. SriLanka's key social indicators stand well above those in

comparable developing countries and are on par with many

developed countries. As the World Bank has recently indicated,

Sri Lanka has already achieved the Millennium Development

Goals in the areas of universal net primary enrolment, gender

equality and infant and matemal mortality. Sri Lanka achieved

the rank of 96 out of 177 countries in the latest Human

Development Index (HDI) in 2004. However, the socialinfrastructure has not yet been developed up to aninternationally competitive standard to uplift Sri Lanka's

growth and development.r Developing economies are gaining greater comparativeadvantage in the production and export of social

infrastructure services, especially healthcare and education

services. Sri Lanka could benefit by providing such servicesif the necessary reforms are undertaken. The high qualityprofessionals in countries like Sri Lanka coupled with thephysical environment which is attractive for tourism enhancethe opportunities for developing a sound services industry.However, the two major sectors, i.e., health and education, arenot sufficiently liberalised to produce high quality services at

an affordable price both for the domestic population and to meetforeign demand. Instead, Sri Lankans even reson to obtainingthese services abroad, while a significant proportion of thehighly skilled population remains unemployed. Hence, thehealth and education sectors in Sri Lanka need'to concentrateon resolving deep-rooted problems that hinder their progress.

Healthi The broad aim of Sri Lanka's health policy is to increase lifeexpectancy and to improve the quality of life by controllingpreventable diseases through health promotion activities.Five strategic objectives have been set to achieve the missionof the Ministry of Healthcare and Nutrition. These strategicobjectives are: to ensure the delivery of comprehensive healthselices, which reduce the disease burden and promote health;

to empowercommunities to actively participate in maintainingtheir health; to improve human resources for healthdevelopment and management; to improve health financing,

resource allocation and utilization and to strengthen stewardship

and management functions of the health system. In attempting

to achieve these objectives, the govemment provides healthcarefree of charge to the entire population, whereas the private

sector operates a fee-based system.

accounted for the balance. Government expenditure onhealthcare was 1.9 per cent of GDP in 2005. The continuingdifficulties in maintaining the heavy public funding forgovernment healthcare pro_srammes provided to all without

targetin,{ are a strain on maintaining the quality of the public

health service. The deterioration in some aspects of the publicsector health services was to some extent, mitigated by the

increased private sector investments, mainly in curative healthcare. However, preventive care, which is mostly of the natureof a public good, suffered due to inadequate funding and othertypical state sector inefficiencies, threatening the erosion of SriLanka's historical achievements. Therefore, the introduction of

a proper targeting system could save public funds for enhancingpreventive healthcare, thus elevating Sri Lanka's healthperformance. This is especially relevant since private sectorinvestors have minimal incentive for promoting preventive

healthcare.. The sustainability of health sector achievements isthreatened by several developments. The major problemsinclude untargeted spending by the government, insufficient

investment in health infrastructure and equipment, budgetaryconstraints, labour disputes, insufficient trained health

personnel and weak preventive healthcare services. These have

caused a series of problems ranging from a high level ofmalnutrition among children and pregnant women, the

resurgence of communicable diseases such as malaria and

dengue, and an increase in non-communicable diseases such asheart diseases, diabetes and hypertension. Mental illness,

substance abuse, depression, suicides and accident are also onthe increase. Emerging issues include aging problems and

deteriorating healthcare for the elderly and the disabled.The achievements in Sri Lanka's health sector areconsidered highly commendable when compared withcomparable per capita income developing countries. With

a life expectancy of 73 years, an infant mortality rate of I l. I per

1,000 live births (2003) and a matemal mortality rate of 0.1 per1,000 live births (2002), Sri Lanka's health standards areconsidered satisfactory. Sri Lanka has achieved the goal ofuniversal child immunization and contained the spread ofcommunicable diseases. The availability of free healthcare dueto the emphasis placed on social welfare since independence

and other interventions aimed at improving nutrition and familyhealth were responsible for these achievements. As a

consequence, Sri Lanka enjoys lower infant and maternalmortality rates when compared with most other developing

countries, especially SAARC countries.

Although the government continues to play a major role in

the country's healthcare system, maintaining public healthsector achievements has now become a challenge. Of thetotal expenditure on health, expenditure by the government

accounted for approximately 43 per cent, while private sources

$ Reforms proposed to address major issues in the healthsector have been implemented to a certain extent. The

Presidential Task Force set up in 1997 recommended a seriesof measures to overcome major problems in the health sector.Out of these recommendations five thrust recommendations

have been identified for immediate implementation. These

are improving at least one hospital in each district, expandingservices to areas of special needs, developing healthpromotional programmes, reforming the organisational

structure including alternative financing mechanisms andpromoting resource sharing with the private sector.Accordingly, 36 hospitals have been identified across thecountry and steps have been taken for their phased outdevelopment. Twenty-two estate hospitals have been

developed and action has been taken to establish at least one

mental rehabilitation centre in each district. Staff strength of

the public hospitals has been improved and progress has been

made on amending the Private Medical Ordinance. The Health

Cluster of the NCED was involved in reviewing the National

Health Development Master Plan, inter alia, developing other

policies.r Private investments in the health sector continued toincrease. Private health institutions providing curative

healthcare increased to 190 in 2005 from 174 in 2004,

reflecting the increasing demand for high quality healthcare

services. As a tradeable service, Sri Lanka's health servicesare gradually gaining competitiveness with increased

investments by the private sector. This is especially relevantto Sri Lanka's efforts to attract tourists by providing the

necessary infrastructure, and promoting tourism in niche areas

such as health tourism. Of the total health expenditure of 3.5

per cent of GDP in 2004, contribution of the private sector

was 2.0 per cent of GDP. With the increasing participation ofthe private sector in healthcare provision, it is essential to

develop a market based regulatory framework to ensure thatquality and standards are maintained.

Educationo Progressive improvement in the education system is a pre'

requisite for rapid economic growth and development. This

is particularly relevant for a country aiming at developing anincreasingly knowledge-based economy. Successive

governments in Sri Lanka have attempted to improve the

education system by introducing reforms in general education,

technical and vocational education and higher education. These

reforms have resulted in some progress but are inadequate to

address the growing needs of the economy. During the past

decade, despite significant limitations, private sector

involvement in education has shown remarkable expansion,filling the gaps in SriLanka's public sectoreducational system.. The education sector is subject to a major reformprogramme, which was initiated in 1998. The main

objectives of the reforms introduced in the general education

sector were to promote access and equity and improve the

quality of education. The key elements of the reforms were

strengthening service delivery, upgrading selected regional

schools, the revision of curricula in all stages of education,

changing the methodology of teaching and leaming, providinginputs of good quality to schools and improving school

management. Reforms in university education and vocational

training focused on expansion, improving relevance and the

creation of opportunities in tertiary education within public

ownership.. Steps have been taken to improve the infrastructure

facilities of schools in rural and semi urban areas. This was

accomplished by introducing the Navodya Schools Programme,

introducing activity based learning approaches, inclusion of

ICT Education in the curriculum, the establishment of studentcounselling and career guidance programmes and the

promotion of English education. To further buttress these

efforts, steps have been taken to implement the new Education

Sector Development Framework Programme (ESDFP) during

2006 - 2010. The ESDFP envisages promoting equity by

enabling all children in the country to access and complete basic

and secondary education, enhancing the quality, improving

economic and social relevance, strengthening the capacity of

the education system to allocate and distribute public resourcesefficiently and equitably within the school system and

improving the governance and institutionalcapacity of central

and provincial agencies to deliver high quality services. The

General Education Project funded by the World Bank for

improving quality, equity and efficiency of general education,

World Bank for improving effectiveness of teacher services, the

concluded in 2005. Under this latter project, 1,000 computerlearning centres, 2,300 multi media centres, 36 sciencelaboratories and on-site environmental laboratories and 30additional computer resource centres at zonal level were

established while 54 Central Colleges were rehabilitared.

Regional disparities in the general education continue toloom large. A Recent survey on skills in the first language,

mathematics and the English lan,eua_ee shows high provincialdisparity when compared with the Western province. The

students' participation rate in the junior secondary level was 87

per cent in the Western province, whereas it was 78 per cent and73 per cent in the North West and the North East provinces,respectively. There is a severe shortage of qualified and

competent teachers in regional schools. To address these issues,a total of 15,000 unemployed graduates were recruited asteachers in 2005. However, it is essential to provide

comprehensive training in teaching methods and educationalpsychology to those chosen to make them competent teachersfor effective delivery of services. During 2005, a total of 3,706

students trained in l7 National Colleges of Education were alsorecruited as teachers to schools.

The tsunami of December 2004 had a severe impact oneducation infrastructure. A total of 182 schools in 10 districtswere destroyed completely or partially by the tsunami. Action

has been taken to reconstruct all these schools, largely withforeign assistance. The total estimated cost to rebuild these

schools has been estimated at Rs.l0 billion. Action has also

been taken to renovate 442 schools, which were used to shelterdisplaced persons in the aftermath of the tsunami.

The public sector monopoly of university education in SriLanka suffers from both an inability to meet the demand foruniversity education and a failure to supply high qualityeducation in many fields, compatible with global trends.In

2005, although lll,725 students were eligible for universityeducation, only 14,520 placements were available in

universities. The recent drive to recruit unemployed graduates

to public institutions revealed that over 40,000 -qraduates were

seekin-e employment. The failure of university education weremanifested in many indicators: a large number of students

entering the labour force at an early a_qe, a significant number

institutes making a commercial presence in Sri Lanka to attractlocal students. Agitation against the establishment of privateuniversities has kept the govemment postponing the much-

needed decision of deregulatin-e higher education. This is akin

to regulating domestic service provision in favour of the importof services.

At the end of 2005 Sri Lanka had 15 universities thatenrolled ffi,386 students, excluding the students of the Open

University. In 2005, the Uva-Wellassa University was

established to enhance the intake of students as well as to ensurea regional balance in the provision of higher educationopportunities. In addition, the University of Visual and

Performing Arts was established by amalgamating institutions,which were providing aesthetic studies.o International studies show that the social rate of return ofprimary and secondary education is significantly higher

than the private rate of return. This justifies the continuationof public investment in primary and secondary education.However, the private rate of return is higher in tertiaryeducation, thus indicating that it is reasonable to char_ee

individuals for their tertiary education. Considering the inabilityof the state universities to absorb a reasonable number of

students who seek entrance to university due to the inability to

expand the public university system, owing to fiscalconstraints,it is essential to provide alternative higher education

opportunities. Intemational experiences show that deregulationof university education has brought in promising results.

However, the deregulation has to be accompanied by a set of

comprehensive rules and guidelines, which ensure that private

universities maintain the required standards in line with the

changing global trends.t There are seyeral other public and private institutionsproviding higher education and professional education.Amongst those institutions are the Sri Lanka Institute of

Information Technology, Institute of Chartered Accountants ofSri Lanka, Sri Lanka Law College, National Institute of

Business Management and the Institute of Bankers of Sri

Lanka.o A large number of public and private institutions are

involved in technical and vocational education and training(TVET). Tertiary andVocational Education Commission as the

central planning, development and coordinating body for theTVET sector, and the Ministry of Vocational and Technical

Training are implementing competency-based training (CBT)programmes through a number of public and private

institutions. These public institutions include the Department ofTechnical Education and Training (DTET), VocationalTraining Authority of Sri Lanka (VTA) and National

Apprenticeship and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA).

There are 365 CBT courses identified to be provided through

these institutions. The Ministry of Vocational and TechnicalTraining in association with relevant training institutions

envisages the setting up of a University of Technology to

conduct higher diploma and degree programmes on TVET withinitial financial assistance from the ADB.

Housing and Urban Development. The demand for houses and the expansion of the urban

sector increases with continuing population growth and

economic development. The demand for new houses in Sri

Lanka is rising at around 100,000 units per year. In addition,

there is a need for meeting a large pent up demand and a large

number of sub-standard houses require upgrading. As per the

latest Census of Housing and Population suryey conducted in

2001, the shortage of housing was 218,295 units with anadditional 1,325,880 sub-standard units requiring improve-ments. Further, the tsunami disaster of December 2004

completely destroyed 10,637 houses while another 30,839 units

were partially damaged.c The Government plays a facilitator role in the housingsector. The Ministry of Housing and Construction paysattention to issues such as land for housing, resource

mobilization for housing finance, developing infrastructure and

other services, cost effective technology development and

simplification of approval procedures. The govemment is also

implementing special housing programmes for targeted groups.

The government, in its Budget for 2005 proposed to provide

housing loans at a concessionary rate of interest to government

servants through commercial banks. The National Housing

Development Authority (NHDA) is the main public institution

that implements housing programmes targeted at low-income

households. Other key government institutions that play a key

role in the provision of public sector housin-q are Ministry of

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (MFAR) and the Plantation

Human Development Trust (PHDT). The NHDA has planned

to build 175,000 housing units during the three year period

2005-2007. It has corrmenced building 5,040 housing units in

2005 under the 'Sustainable Village' programme initiated by

the Ministry of Housing and Construction. The NHDA has also

identified 9,545 housing units for redevelopment in 2005 and

another 19,200 units for redevelopment by end 2W7. Roofing

materials were distributed among 43,625 families under the

Roofing Sheets Assistance hogramme financed by way of an

Indian Line of Credit. Housing programmes of the MFAR wereaffected by the tsunami. The PHDT continued with

implementing several housing construction and upgradingprogrammes in the estate sector under the Plantation

Development Support hogramme (PDSP) in 2005. The RealEstate Exchange (Pvt.) Ltd., (REEL), which is the

implementing arm of the Sustainable Townships Programme,

provides shelter for the urban poor in the city of Colombo. The

REEL commenced the construction of 3,000 housing units

under this programme in 2ffi1

The private sector has emerged as the major supplier of

houses, especially to middle and high-income households.

The private sector is playing a vital role in housing through the

direct construction of houses as well as by developing lands,

providing inputs and finance. Condominium development by

corporate property developers in urban and suburban areas has

shown a significant growth in recent years. Housing loans

granted by financial institutions also increased in 2005.

Commercial banks have granted 89,335 housing loans to the

value of Rs.22,803 million during 2005. The three housing

banks, namely, State Mortgage and Investment Bank (SMIB),

Housing Development Finance Corporation Bank (HDFC

Bank) and NDB Housing Bank and the National Savings Bank

(NSB) have together granted 23,305 housing loans to the value

of Rs, 8,607 million in 2005, in comparison to 18,741 loans in2W4.

The housing finance market faces several issues, whichinhibit its growth. These include, the lack of long-term vision

on housing development, the absence of long-term sources of

funds, a mismatch of cash flows in lending institutions for

housing, legal and institutionalissues, problems relating to landtenure and land titles and lack of new housing finance

instruments, In addition, sharp rises in land prices, high salaries

and wages in the construction industry, high cost of major

building materials and the lack of skilled labour also restrain the

growth of the housin-e sector. The development of a secondary

mort-qa,qe market would rcsolve funding issues to a great extent.

Therefbre, it is essential that a secondary mort_qa_qe system beestablished for primary mortgage lenders alon_e with the

necessary legal and regulatory fl'amework. It is expected that

primary mortgage lendin_e could increase by as much as 75 per

cent if an efficient secondary mortgage market is available.s The Urban Development Authority (UDA) plays a key rolein planning and executing urban development projects inthe country. The UDA gave priority to the development oftsunami-ravaged urban arcas in 2005. It en-eaged in facilitating

the permanent relocation of atfected families, the identificationof lands for relocation, the reconstruction of damaged houses,

the enforcement of plannin_e and buildin_e regulations, and the

reconstruction of tsunami affected townships. For this purpose,

the UDA established 52 project offices in the affected areas, It

has identified62 towns, (I2large towns,20 medium towns and30 small towns), which were affected by the tsunami, for

development. Initially, l5 townships have been selected for

development on a priority basis at an estimated cost of US

dollars 250 million.i The main operational activitic of the IJDA continued. Theseincluded the construction of administrative complexes and

commercial complexes, and implementing town improvement

projects, industrial projects and integrated projects.

Safety Netso The Samurdhi programme is aimed at improving thenutritional status of poor communities by providing directfinancial assistance and implementing programmes toenhance their income levels. About 2 million families

benefited directly fiom the Samurdhi income supplementary

pro.qramme in 2005. The total expenditure on food stampsprovided under the income supplementary pro-eramme was

Rs.9,244 million in 2005 compared ro Rs 8,591 million in2004.The Samurdhi Authority of Sri Lanka (SASL) implemented

various programmes to enhance the living standards and income

levels of the Samurdhi beneficiaries. The main programmesimplemented by the SASL in 2005 were 'Janapubudu'

programme to establish 100,000 income generating projects forthe benefit of Samurdhi beneficiary families, the SocialMobilization Programme aimed at empowering ruralcommunities, the'Gamipubudu' programme.to provide basicinfrastructure facilities to remote villages and the housingprogramme to support the construction of houses for poor

families.

The Welfare Benefit Act (WBA) passed in2002provides thelegal framework for improving the targeting of Smurdhi

benefits in a transparent manner. The implementation of theAct will ensure an improvement of the selection process, theidentification of eligible families, the removal of overlap with

other welfare programmes and ultimately increase benefits topoor families. As per data released by the Department of

Census and Statistics, the population living below the povetyline (Rs. 1,423 per month in 2002) was only 22.7 per cent,though nearly half of the total population received Samurdhi

benefits. This indicates the need for better targeting of socialwelfare programmes, which would result in an increase in

benefits to needy households.

The performance of the Samurdhi Savings Schemescontinued to expand. The Samurdhi compulsory savings fund

increased by 5 per cent ro Rs.6,950 million in 2005, while

Environment. Maintaining an appropriate balance between economic

development and the utilisation of natural resources is vitalto ensure long-term sustainable development. Negative

externalities arising from economic activities could have anadverse impact on the natural environment. Regulation,effective enforcement and increasing awareness among thegeneral public play an important role in protecting theenvironment. The Ministry of Environment and NaturalResources (MENR), being the apex institution for the

management of natural resources of the country, continued theformulation of environmental policies in 2005, while the

Central Environment Authority bore primary responsibility for

the enforcement of regulations.I MENR introduced several policy measures in 2005 for theprotection of the environment. Cabinet approval was granted

for the National Cleaner hoduction Policy and Strategies, and

the National Bio-safety Policy in 2005. The Bio-safety Policy

ensures the enforcement of regulations in respect of genetically

modified food. The draft National Policy on Sand was preparedin 2005 incorporating comments received from the

general public.

The MENR continued monitoring, coordinating andimplementing international conventions and treaties in2005. Major international treaties include the GlobalEnvironment Mana-qement Project, United Nation's

Convention to combat desertification, the Vienna Convention

and the Montreal Protocol, Stockholm Convention on persistent

or-{anic pollutants, the Convention on biological diversity and

the Cartegena protocol in bio-safety,

The Ministry introduced new regulations to the NationalWatershed Management Policy. The new regulations aim at

reducing the degradation of steep slopes in upper watershedareas through prohibiting cultivation activities andimplementing the Upper Watershed Management Project,which includes forest rehabilitation activities such as bufferzone plantation, home-gardening, conservation orientedfarming, awareness and media programmes and conservationof landslide proven areas.In addition to designing policies and formulatingregulations, the MENR implemented several otherprogrammes aimed at improving the natural environment.Unsatisfactory management of solid and liquid waste is a

cntical issue particularly in urban areas and poses serious risks

to the health of the public. Local government authorities, which

bear the responsibility for waste management, lack adequate

resources and technology for the purpose. The MENR updated

the database on Municipal Solid Waste in Sri Lanka publishedin 1999. This data base would be useful in taking strategic

action on waste disposal, prevention, reduction, reuses and

recycling in an environmentally sound manner. Regarding

waste disposal the MENR initiated a project to identify finaldisposal facilities/sanitary landfill sites for solid waste.

However. a number of environmental issues such as land

degradation due to soil erosion, depletion of coastal resources,

loss of biodiversity, solid waste disposal, and inland waterpollution that continue to exist require urgent attention of the

authorities.

The Central Environment Authority (CEA) as the regulatorof the national environment, continued to regulate andpromote environmental activities. The CEA processed 127

Environmental Impact Assessments (ELA) in 2005 and granted

approval for2L projects. During the year, the CEA issued 160Environmental Protection Licenses (EPL), while 134

applications were recommended for the setting up of newfactories. The CEA received 1,965 public complaints on

environmental matters in 2005 (l,350complaints were from the

Western Province) and action was taken in respect of most

complaints during the year.
