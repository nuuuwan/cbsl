ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL STABILITY, OUTLOOK ANDPOLICIES

1.1 Macroeconomic Developments, Stabilityand Policy Responses in 2005c Sri Lanka's economy demonstrated its resilience once againin 2005 by growing at a rate of 6 per cent, exceeding the

expectations in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami

disaster of 20}4.Inflation was subdued through prudentmonetary policy measures and by the favourable

developments in aggregate supply. The stability of thefinancial system was strengthened through improved

supervision and regulation in line with international best

practices. The year started with several challenges posed by

domestic and external shocks and their related uncertainties.

The impact of the tsunami necessitated a massive volume of

resources for a quick recovery, oil prices were escalating

rapidly, the Multi-Fibre Anangement (MFA) came to an end on

I January 2005 and elections related uncertainty loomed lar,qe.

Additionally, the peace process was at a standstill- As the year

progressed, the uncertainties began to dissipate and the

economy marched forward with a renewed vigour providing

sufficient room for policy manoeuvrability to maintain both

price and financial stability. Hi-{h economic growth and

relatively lower population growth pushed per capita income to

a higher level of US dollars 1,197. Responding well to monetary

policy measures and supported by favourable developments in

aggregate supply, inflation declined from a peak 15.9 per cent

in February 2005, to reach 8 per cent by December 2005. The

annual average inflation in 2005 was 1l'6 per cent- The

unemployment rate declined to 1.7 per cent by August 2005

from 8.3 per cent in 2004. The balance of payments (BOP)

recorded a surplus of US dollars 501 million, strengthening

external reserves and contributin-q to exchange rate stability.

The fiscal position was further consolidated, especially on the

revenue front. The stability and resilience of the financial sector

improved with higher protits, enhanced risk management and

nanowed interest spreads, and the sector provided better access

to finance.e Economic growth needs to be accelerated further to at least

8 per cent to alleviate poverty, reduce unemployment and

raise the standard of living on a sustainable basis' The

government's plans to achieve the desired growth have been

articulated in several policy documents, most notably in the

'Mahinda Chintana' policy document. The strategy of the

government stresses the need for combining an efficient private

sector with a facilitative public sector, while strengthening the

pre-requisites for growth as well as growth promoting factors'

The -qovernment' s pl ans embrace infrastructure development

thereby enhancing access to markets, investing in human capital

and encoura-gi ng technology i mprov ements by entrepreneurs,

promotin-9 investments throughout the country by ensuring

policy stability and consistency, increasing institutional support

and providing incentives for research and development. These

efforts have to be complemented with required reform measures

to further enhance the overall efficiency of the economy.A comprehensive public awareness program on the role and

limitations of the public sector, the benefits of liberalisation and

reforms and the role of the private sector in improving

competitiveness and increasing access to both domestic and

international markets through their own efforts, is needed to

ensure public support for much needed economic reforms.

s The reform efforts are timely, since Sri Lanka is graduallyfacing serious limitations to economic growth arising frominsufficient capacity expansion. The most notable limitationis seen in the power sector, which could stifle growth in allareas. Limitations in the capacity of roads, railways, portservices, telecommunications and irrigation lead to seriousdrawbacks to investment, growth, regional development andinternational competitiveness. The rapid increase in housingdevelopment is adding pressure on the already strained publicutilities. Inadequate capacity building in human resourcedevelopment is reflected in the large number of persons

travelling abroad to receive educational and health services,insufficient managerial skills and the low level of research andinnovation activities in both the private and public sectors.

All major sectors of the economy grew at a healthy pace in2005. The Agriculture sector grew by 1.5 per cent, the Industnal

sector by 8.3 per cent and the Services sector by 6.4 per cent.The three sectors contributed 4.4 per cent, 36.3 per cent and59.3 per cent, respectively, to the GDP growth in 2005.

and fast growing infrastructure system spread throughoutthe economy to help achieve regionally balanced growth.

Public sector institutions, which supply vital services such

as power, water, transport, and other services, are importantservice providing institutions of the government. Most ofthose institutions are monopolies, yet the quality and

adequacy of the services they provide and their financialposition are very poor. Hence, those institutions areearmarked for strategic refoms.

Public Service Reforrns: The public sector will engage inits critical role as facilitator, nurture, pace-setter andstandard bearer. The entire perspective of the public

service will have to focus on learning to anticipate changeand meet the demands of the future in innovative ways.

their historically highest levels of 2,013 thousand metric tonsand 1,233 thousand metric tons, respectively. Tea production

reached a record 317.2 million kg. Output of rubber, vegetables

and other agricultural crops also increased in 2005. Coconut

output declined and fish production did not recover fully, butshowed signs of recovery by end 2005.* Sustainable agricultural development requires measures toenhance productivity, as well as ways of improving access

to finance, availability of land, infrastructure facilities, andmarket-based methods to deal with excessive pricefluctuations. Productivity and profitability could be improved

through further development of technology, research, extension

services and reducing post harvest losses. The government hasalready taken measures to improve access to finance and land,

and to develop infiastructure facilities. Market based methodsto encounter adverse price fluctuations are still being

developed, The per.sistent drop in farm gate prices of paddy andmany varieties of vegetables at the time of harvesting indicates

the absence of competitive market forces. This could be due toanti-competitive practices prevailing in the regions of paddy

and vegetable cultivation as wellas weak infrastructure. Hence,

the government needs to intensely examine the market practices

to bring about a lasting market based solution to the low farm

gate prices.. Industrial sector growth, particularly the growth in thetextile and garments sub sector, continued despite theuncertainty that prevailed in early 2005 and the surge in oilprices to historically high levels. With the termination of theMFA in 2005, the government aggressively pursued a strategyof enhancing access to major markets and these efforts were

complemented by entrepreneurs' initiatives to capture new

markets and consolidate existin_{ markets throu-eh efforts at firmlevel. Sri Lanka's high labour and environment protection

standards. a conducive trade and investment promoting policy

atmosphere and high literacy of the labour force aided this

process.

o The Industrial sector should strive for global

competitiveness and should depend less on protectionist

measures. Several Sri Lankan industries have already

penetrated into foreign markets with a sizeable market share.

Protection increases prices of domestic goods and services,

which are inputs for many industries. Hence, higher prices dueto protection seriously distort input prices of already

competi ti ve i ndustrie s. Furthermore, compe titi ve i ndustri es in

the domestic market could pay higher wages and rents on labour

and capital. Protection adversely affects competitive firms,initiating a vicious cycle of protection and inefficiency and

eventually impacting negatively on efficient industries. An

alternative for protection is improving productivity, which

would lead to lower output prices, benefit all related industries

and help achieve global competitiveness.

The Services sector maintained its growth momentum in

2005 especially in port, telecommunication, and financial

services. Its contribution to growth could have been far

greater had the planned infrastructure development takenplace, especially road development, port and airport

development, as well as further development of socialinfrastructure, especially, education and health services.Capacity enhancement in the Services sector is vital for

sustainable higher economic growth given its si-enificant links

with the other productive sectors.

Sri Lanka faced greater competition and further pressure

on the liberalisation of trade in services in 2005. The Services

Source: Cenlral Bank of Sri Lanka

sector has been the main driver of economic growth in Sri

Lanka as well as in the rest of the developing and developed

world. The sector has been benefiting from globalisation andliberalisation especially in the areas of port services,

telecommunication, construction and financial services. With

regard to recent efforts to liberalise multilateral and bilateral

trade. the Services sector has been earmarked for further

liberalisation. Therefore, it is impofiant for this sector to be

prepared for increased competition while rules and standards of

operation should be established to facilitate and benefit from

liberalisation.. Both investment and savings improved in 2005.Investment

increased to 26.5 per cent of GDP from 25 per cent in 2004,

while domestic savings increased to 17.2per cent of GDP from

15.9 per cent in 2004. Private investment, as a percentage of

GDP, declined marginally from 19.8 per cent in20M to 19.6

per cent in 2005. Public investment including investments by

public corporations improved from 5.1 per cent of GDP in 2004

to 6.9 per cent of GDP in 2005. Domestic savings improved

with private dor4estic savings increasin-e from 19.7 per cent to

19.9 per cent of GDP in 2005, with public dis-savings

declining from 3.9 per cent of GDP to2.7 per cent of GDP. The

savings-investment gap and the conesponding current account

deficit were financed through increased inflows from foreign

direct investment, portfolio investment, and loans and grants to

the government. Dependence on external loan inflows to meet

the savings-investment gap could be reduced by encouraging

foreign direct investment inflows.

An economy consists of three major sectors: agriculture,industry and serr'ices. Many developed and fast growin_ecountries have experienced rapid expansion in the Servicessector when compared to Agriculfure and Industrial sectors.The Services sector is the fastest -rrowing sector of the globaleconomy and account fortwo thirds of global outpur, one thirdof global employment and nearly 20 per cent of global trade.In developed countries, the share of services in the economytypically lies between 60 and 70 per cent, while it is on averagesmaller in developing and least developed countries. In South

Back in 1857; German economist Ernst Engelobserved that as families grew richer, they allocated a smallerportion of the household budget to food.r A nation withgrowing income would spend an increasingly smaller share ofits income on food, shelter and other goods with physicalmanifeslation, The demand is increasilngly for seivices romake life more secure and enjoyable, The economy suppliesmore and more of such services to fulfil the demand, raisingthe services sector output.Many services are major inputs of the national output.Education and health services enhance the quality of humancapital needed for economic growth. Servicls such asinformation technology, telecommunication and financialservices are essential for growing enterp{ises. Thus, if acountry cannot produce those services adequately, it has toimport them to support economic growth and development.Unlike a product, which is traded mostly cross-border, aservice can be traded internationally in four different modes.Mode I - Cross-Border Supply . Services supplied froman institution based in one country to another country. Thismode of supplying services is similar to the supply of goodsacross borders-Mode 2 - Consumption Abroad - Consumers or firms inthe home country making use of a service in a foreign countryby visiting the foreign country. For example, Sri Lanka allowsits residents to purchase services such as health care andeducation by travellin_{ to a foreign country to receive suchservices. thereby enhancing access to services of forei_enservice suppliers.Mode 3 - Commercial Presence - A forei_en companysetting up commercial enterprises to provide services in thehome country. Foreign direct investment is attracted throughthis mode.

Sri Lanka possesses the potential for rapid growth in theexport of services, if domestic restrictions are liberalisedcautiously and the seryices sector institutions are strengthened,Insuftlcient understanding of the mechanisms of trade rnservices has led Sri Lanka to unduly restrict domesticproduction and exports of services such as education andhealth care in which Sri Lanka possesses a competitive

Erternal Sector DevelopmentsSri Lanka succeeded in facing competition in international

trade as a result of the combined efforts of entrepreneurs

and the government to enhance market access. Exports grew

by 10.2 per cent to US dollars 6,347 million and imports grew

by 10.8 per cent to US dollars 8,863 million in 2005.Industnal

exports continued to drive export growth in 2005 with a

dominant share of 78 per cent and contributin-e 75 per cent to

overall export growth. Agricultural exports accounted for l8 per

cent of total exports and contributed l5 per cent to exportgrowth, followed by mineral and other exports, which

accounted for 4 per cent oftotal exports and contributed l0 per

cent to export growth in 2005. The expansion of economic

activities in the country, facilitated by the appreciation of the

exchange rate and the low interest rate regime, and post tsunami

reconstruction activities, raised import demand, over the high

base of the previous year, especially for intermediate and

investment goods,

Historically high oil prices caused a severe strain on thefinancing of the country's import expenditure in 2005.

The expenditure on petroleum imports increased by 37 per cent

to US dollars 1,655 million in 2005. This increase was due to

an increase in prices of a similar magnitude. The domestic

prices of petrol, diesel and kerosene rose only partially by 18

per cent, l9 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively, in 2005. The

required adjustments in domestic consumption did not take

place in 2005 due to only a partial adjustment of domestic

prices. The largest petroleum user in Sri Lanka is the transport

sector (50 per cent), followed by power generation (25 per

cent). Industries, households and other sectors account for the

other 25 per cent of consumption. Passenger transport prices

and electricity prices were not fully adjusted in 2005 to reflect

the actual cost of petroleum, thereby causing a heavy burden on

the government's budget and the viability of related public

sector enterprises.

Large inflows to the government and increased private

remittances bolstered the external flrnance position, leading

to a surplus in the balance of payments and an appreciationof the rupee. The trade deficit widened to US dollars 2,516

million, but the cunent account defrcit widened only marginallyto US dollars 650 million largely due to a sharp growth of

22.6per cent in worker remittances which, reached US dollars

1,918 million in 2005. As a ratio of GDP, the current account

deficit declined trom 3.2 per cent in2004 to 2.8 per cent in

2005. Net inflows to the government increased by 5l per centin 2005 with large tsunami related inflows, and lower debt

service payments resulting from the debt moratoria following

the tsunami, contributing to an overall BOP surplus of US

dollars 50t million. These capital inflows raised gross official

extemal reserves to US dollars 2,735 million (3.7 months of

imports). This, in tum, improved debt servicing capacity and led

to a moderate appreciation of the rupee against major

cuffencies.

Sri Lanka obtained debut sovereign ratings from twointernational rating agencies in 2005. The Fitch Ratings

assigned the country rating of BB- (BB minus) while Standard& Poor's Ratings (S&P) Services rated Sri Lanka at B+(B plus). These will facilitate the mobilisation of financial

resources in international markets by both the govemment and

the private sector.

Fiscal policy in 2005 was aimed at achieving pro-poor andpro-growth development objectives of the government,supporting a speedy recovery of the economy from theunexpected tsunami disaster and moving towards fiscalsustainability in the long run. Overallfiscal management was

challenging in 2005 as the govemment had to be involved in the

tsunami rebuilding process, while facing the implications of theinternational oil price hike. This had to be achieved in an

environment of rising interest rates while servicing the alreadyhigh debt burden. The policy stance continued to be

expansionary to address the immediate needs of the tsunami

recovery as well as the adverse impact of high oil prices, The

tsunami rebuilding process received the assistance of donors

and the private sector in addition to the government's efforts.

Some positive developments were seen in the fiscalconsolidation process in 2fi)5. The revenue collection rose tol6.t per cent of GDP in 2005 from 15.4 per cent in 2004, as

expected in the revised Budget 2005. Tax revenue increased toI4.2 per cent of GDP from 13.9 per cent in the previous year.Total expenditure and net lending, including tsunami

expenditure amounted 1o24.7 per cent of GDP in 2005, which

is similar to the anticipated expenditure in the revised Bud-eet

2005. This was due to the higher cunent expenditure of 18.7 per

cent compared to the revised target of 18.4 per cent in 2005,Public investment including govemment on lending to public

corporations in 2005 increased to 6.3 per cent from 4.8 per cent

of GDP in20M. The overall budget deficit of the govemmentin 2005 amounted 8.7 per cent of GDP. an increase from the

expected deficit of 8.2 per cent in 2005. The deficit, excluding

tsunami expenditure in 2005, reached 7.3 per cent of GDP

compared to the expected deficit of 6.8 per cent of GDP.The budget deficit was financed with domestic resources(5.2 per cent of GDP) and foreign resources (3.5 per cent of

GDP).

The outstanding government debt declined to 93.9 per cent

of GDP from 105.5 per cent in 2ffi4. This was mainly due to

the appreciation of the rupee against major foreign currencies

and the higher growth in nominal GDP. The total government

debt increased by Rs. 82.8 billion to Rs. 2,222.3 billion in

2005. Though the debt to GDP ratio declined in 2005, the

government debt still remains high. This situation poses several

threats including rising interest payment commitments, adverse

implications for monetary and fiscal policies and reducing thecountry's ability to withstand external shocks. Thus, it

underscores the need for strong measures to further improve thefiscal consolidation process to reduce the debt burden and

achieve fiscal sustainability in the medium to long run.

The gradual tightening of monetary policy, begun in2004,

was continued in 2005 with the objectives of containinginflationary pressures, containing the rapid growth ofmonetary aggregates and facilitating the recovery of theeconomy. The tsunami devastation prompted a temporary

change in the focus of monetary policy in 2005. The daily open

market operations (OMOs) were temporarily suspended fromearly in January 2005, to ensure the smooth functioning of

financial markets during the early post-tsunamiperiod. OMOs

were subsequently recommenced late in February 2005 as the

threat of the tsunami on the financial sector and economicactivities began to dissipate gradually. Subsequently, OMOs

had to be conducted aggressively to contain the inflationary

pressures. The tightening of the monetary policy stance through

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2005

Part IChapter 1 - ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES

aggressive OMOs was further buttressed by taking measures to

contain the reserve money expansion. Accordingly, the Central

Bank refrained from purchasing Treasury bills in the primary

market as far as possible, conducted secondary market outright

sales to mop up excess liquidity from the market permanently

and raised the Central Bank's policy interest rates, viz.

Repurchase and Reverse repurchase rates, in four steps: 25 basis

points in May, 50 basis points in June, 25 basis points in

September, and a further 25 basis points in December 2005.r The economy responded well to the tightening of monetary

policy as made evident from the slowing down of monetary

expansion, the moderation in inflation and the decline in

inflation expectations. Reserve money expansion decelerated

to the targeted growth path by end December 2005 and broad

money growth also slowed down, although the growth rate

remained high. Greater stability in the external sector too

supported monetary operations in achieving monetary policy

objectives. Inflation decelerated from the high level in early

2005 by the end of the year, supported by monetary tightening,

greater stability in exchange rates and favourable developments

in the aggregate supply. A decline in inflation expectations was

reflected in the lower secondary market yield rates pertaining

to government securities and the lower premia in the foreign

exchange forward markets.r The financial sector expanded with improved stability and

resilience in 2ffi5. The performance of financial institutions

improved in terms of profits, soundness and a widening of the

array of financial products and services during 2005. Access to

finance was further enhanced with financial institutions offering

new facilities and with the setting up of a new institution

catering especially to Small and Medium scale Enterprises

(SMEs). Activities in financial markets surged to record high

levels, particularly in the foreign exchange and share markets,

with rising confidence in economic prospects'r During 2005, the Central Bank took several measures tofurther improve the stability of the financial system.

Financial sector infrastructure was further improved with

measures being taken to increase the efficiency of the payment

and settlement systems, the introduction of new legislation to

facilitate the smooth functioning of the financial system, and

improvements made to the regulatory and supervisoryframework in line with international best practices'

The Payment and Settlement Systems Act, No' 28, enacted in

September 2005, enables the Central Bank to oversee the

national payment and settlement systems' Further an

amendment was made to the Banking Act in 2005 to prohibit

fraudulent network marketin-E practices. The efficiency of the

Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system and the Scripless

Securities Settlement (SSS) system was improved and access

to those systems was widened. To improve the retail payment

and settlement system, a Cheque Imaging and Truncation (CIT)

system will be implemented in 2006. Financial institutions were

requested to enhance their capital and new regulations have

been issued in relation to the single borrower limit, related party

transactions and disclosure of information' Banks have been

advised to adopt the Basel II capital accord by 2008. The fit and

proper criteria for selecting the board of directors of financial

institutions have been further strengthened. The Central Bank

continued its public awareness campaign aimed at educating the

public on the risks of investing in unregulated and fraudulent

financial institutions and investing in fraudulent net work

marketing schemes. To enhance public confidence and to

generate public awareness of the stability of the financial

system, the Central Bank published the second Financial

Stability Review 2005 updating the status of financial system

stability.. The resolution of several important issues relating to the

cost of intermediation, the supervision of conglomerates andimprovements in corporate governance may further

enhance the resilience and stability of the financial systemwhile improving confidence in the financial system.

The intermediation cost of banks, represented by the interest

spread, has declined in the recent past, but still remains high

relative to regional standards. Efforts need to be made by banksto improve efficiency and productivity to lower the highintermediation cost. Recent issues relating to the concentrationof share ownership of financialinstitutions, which underminespublic and investor confidence, underscore the necessity forstrengthenin-q corporate governance in flnancial institutions.This has been evident in the cross shareholdings in financialconglomerates and the resulting conflicts of interest. TheCentral Bank has already taken initiatives to enhance corporategovernance through strict enforcement of the Banking Act andimposing market discipline through greater disclosure ofinformation by financial institutlons.

1.2 External Economic Environmento With continuing growth and subdued inflation in the globaleconomy, the external economic environment remainsfavourable to Sri Lankats economic growth prospects.Despite the continuous surge in international oil prices and thefrequent occurrence of naturaldisasters, global GDP growth in2005 reached4.S per cenr. This followed the economic growthof 5.3 per cent in 2004, the highest in the past few decades.However, the growth in the volume of world trade slowed downto 7.3 per cent in 2005 from 10.4 per cent in 2004, reflectingthe slow down in global economic growth. Global headlineinflation picked up marginatly in 2005 in response to higher oilprices, but core inflation remained stable and inflationexpectations have remained well grounded given the gradualwithdrawal of the monetary policy stimulus in many countries,

Future prospects for global economic growth remain robust and

the globalGDP is projected to grow in 2005 ar a slightly higherrate of 4.9 per cent in 2006. However, there are a number ofdownside risks to the projected global outlook, High andvolatile oil pnces and their impact on price levels could threatenthe current stability in core inflation. The avian flu couldbecome pandemic leading to extremely high human andeconomic costs. The rising global imbalances, especially thelarge current account deficit in the USA and its growingexternal indebtedness, pose the risk of disorderly adjustment iffinancing those deficits becomes difficult.s The economic growth of Sri Lanka's major exportdestination countries remains robust. The projected growthin the USA is expected to moderate but will still remainrelatively higher than the growth in other industrial countries.In Japan, economic activity is expected to pick up strongly,

easing deflationary pressures. Despite the weak performance of

the Euro area in 2005, its expansion gained momentum from thefourth quarter of 2005 onwards. The economic -erowth of

specific factors contributed to the marginal slow down. In

emergin-e Asia, India and China continued to exceed expectedgrowth rates, supported by strong domestic and external

demand. Middle Eastern countries and the Commonwealth ofIndependent States benefited from rising oil prices. There areno signs of a slowing down of activity in emergin_e markets and

developin_{ countries.s Efforts to strengthen the rule based trading systemcontinued and Sri Lanka made further progress in securingmarket access through multilateral, regional and bilateraltrading arrangements in 2005. Sri Lanka remained firmlycommitted to the multilateral tradin-e system, bein_e a founder

member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). At the SixthWTO Ministerial Meeting in Hong Kon,e SAR held in 2005,some progress was achieved in implementing the DohaDevelopment A-eenda. Substantial pro_qress was made inphasin_e out agriculture subsidies and granting extra

concessions to Least Developed Countries. On the regionalfront, Sri Lanka agreed to convert the South Asian PreferentialTrading Arrangement (SAPTA) into the Sourh Asian Free

Trade Area (SAFTA). A further stride in re_eional agreements

was made with Sri Lanka achieving substantial progress in

finalisin-e the draft Free Trade Area (FTA) of the Bay of BengalInitiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic

Cooperation (BIMST-EC). Sri Lanka continued to receive tariff

concessions from member countries under the Global Systemof Trade Preferences (GSTP), which was established as aframework for the exchange of tariff preferences among

developing countries. Bilateral negotiations between Sri Lanka

and the European Union (EU) on the GSP+ scheme yielded a

breakthrough in 2005, but fufther negotiations are required to

reap its full benefits. Negotiations on the Comprehensive

Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) between Sri Lankaand India continued in 2005. The bilateral framework

agreement signed by Sri Lanka and Pakistan on trade became

operational from June 2W5, after resolving issues relating to

concessions sought by both countries. Several other bilateral

trade discussions took place in 2005 with Thailand, USA andIran. It is important for Sri Lanka to rationalise the existing

economic relations by taking into account the collective impact

on the medium to long-term path of liberalisation and ensuing

economic developments.

Global financial market conditions remained orderly in 2005.Although short-term interest rates continued to rise due to the

monetary policy tightening in the USA and the Euro area, long-

term global interest rates remained low, Higher net savings by

both emerging markets and the corporate sector in developed

countries and increased oil revenues provided ample liquidiry to

global financial markets, which also helped maintain stable long-run interest rates. The short-run interest rate differential

favourable to the US dollar led to greater financial flows to the

USA and the appreciation of the US dollar which helped finance

the growing current account deficit in the USA without causing

any disorderly adjustments. A notable development in emergin-e

Asia dunng 2005 was the introduction of more flexible exchangerate regimes in China and Malaysia, which relaxed theircunencies' longstanding peg to the US dollar. This move is

expected to partly address global cunent account imbalances.

However, an orderly adjustment of global imbalances requiresfurther appreciation of currencies in surplus Asian and oilproducing countries against the US dollar. Many emergin_q

markets and developing countries issued intemationalbonds with

favourable interest spreads to meet their bonowing needs.

High oil prices may prevail, but any further escalationremains uncertain. A fundamental uncertainty aboutboth demand for and supply of oil arises from the pace ofglobal economic growth, usage of oil, continuingpolitical unceftainty and limited spare capacity. The uncertain

global energy situation requires Sri Lanka to be cautious in its

energy policy. The undue fiscal burden due to f'uel subsidies andhigh fuel consumption could be reduced through a consistent

ener-qy pricing policy that reflects international price

movements. Energy producing state-owned enterprises need to

be reformed to ensure their financial viability and therebythe provision of uninterrupted supply of energy at a

competitive price.

1.3 Medium Term Macroeconomic Outlook,Challenges and Policiest The Medium Term Macroeconomic Framework (MTMF)

presented with the Budget 2006 expects the country to move

onto a higher growth path with improved macroeconomicstability in the medium term. In the next four years, GDPgrowth is expected to accelerate substantially bolsteringregional development as well as the nation rebuilding

programme of the government in the aftermath of the tsunami

devastation. The growth is intended to be achieved through

enhanced savings and investment supportedby productivity andcapacity improvements. The external sector is expected tofurther improve in the medium-run benefiting from the

i mproving poli ti cal and macroeconomic environment, domestic

supply improvements, global demand, higher inflows throughremittances and foreign direct investment, and greaterutilisation of foreign assistance. The fiscal consolidation

process will also be continued through further measures to

increase revenue, and to rationalise expenditure, leading to a

surplus in the cunent account. Benefiting from the strengthened

fiscal consolidation and the higher economic growth rate public

investment may rise and the debt burden may decline. Monetarypolicy and monetary management over the medium term will

continue to aim at maintaining price stability while facilitating

economic growth.a Achieving the targets of the MTMF depends on severalcrucial factors. Restoring permanent peace would boostinvestor confidence and accelerate expansion in economicactivities. Prudent macroeconomic policies have to be put in

place to ensure macroeconomc stability. The capacity of theeconomy to grow can be significantly enhanced through a

comprehensive reform programme that would encompass thedevelopment of pre-requisites for economic growth andfostering of growth supportive factors. These include

countering asymmetric information problems such as the

principal agent problem and rent seeking and enhancing public

sector accountability as well as the delivery mechanism. Theseefforts have to be complemented by conducting a

comprehensive public awareness program on the role andlimitations of the public sector, benefits of liberalisation andreforms, and the role of the private sector in improving

competitiveness and increasing access to both domestic and

international markets through their own efforts. A successful

outcome in oil exploration could turn Sri Lanka into a trade

surplus country, providing resources to further accelerate thegrowth process.

Welfare Cost of Subsidies

Subsidies are of different types: transfers of budgetary

resources, tax holidays, tax concessions, supplying goods or

services below cost and policies that create transfers throughthe market mechanism. Subsidies are popular rneans ofproviding relief by governments to categories of persons

(e.9. farmers), private agents and public enterprises, enabling

them to either purchase or sell a good or a service at a costbelow the market price.

The welfare cost of subsidies is multi faceted. They leadto governments incurring a budgetary burden, which has to bemet through either increased taxing of the population orincreasing the goVernment's indebtedness or covering the coStby cutting fiscal expenditure, frequently by reducingexpenditure on public investment. Thus, subsidies ofteninvolve a serious opportunity cost of growth and developmentwith the reallocation of resources from productive public

investment to current expenditure. Furthermore, Iower prices,mostly below the cost of production paid by economic agentson goods and services could lead to over exploitation andmisallocation of resources. Utilities such as water, electricity

and peuoleum in many countries are subject to subsidies andthose resourcCs are being over exploited. Such overexploitation could lead to a worldwide shortage of resources:In Sri Lanka, subsidies are widespread. Annual subsidiesfor fuel and fertiliser:amount to Rs.26 billion and Rs.6.8

billion, respectively. These subsidies amounted to 1.4 per centof GDP in 2005, which could be compaired with the totalpublic spending on health in 2005 (Rs.44.8 billion) and the

cost of the Norochcholai power project (Rs.47,9 billion). It isalmost equal to the total estimated cost of the SouthernHighway (Rs.33.9 billion). This is several times higher than

the allocation (Rs.0.35 billion) made for the new Uva WellassaUniversity in 2005. The annual cost of subsidies could beutilised to construct about 1,300 schools or about 160 basehospitals per year. In addition to these, a wide range ofcorporate tax holidays and tax concessions existC leading to a

loss of fiscal revenue.The key issues in managing subsidies are the size,incidence and distortions in alloCation. The advetseimplications of subsidies could be minimised by theirreduction through provision of subsidies only to the needythrough proper targeting. Thou-eh the need for reducingsubsidies has been recognised, intervention by variouspressure groups and insufficient consensus oh reforming

subsidies, often does not allow the implementation of suChpolicies.Rationalisation of subsidies can remove economic

distortions, thereby improving efficiency and growth, reduce

the budgetary burden and significantly enhance much neededpublic investment.

The government has shown its commitment to achieving adurable and lasting peace. Peace talks recommenced in

February 2006 bolstering market confidence and prospects for

economic development.

Further consolidation of macroeconomic stability that has

been achieved so far is essential to developing a conduciveenvironment for markets to operate effectively and the

economy to remain stable. Though the debt to GDP ratio

declined in 2005, the relatively higher level of debt poses a

threat to long-term debt sustainability. Further improvements

are needed to contain the primary and cunent account deficits

thereby generating surpluses needed for debt sustainability and

building up of external reserves. A strong and sustainable fiscal

adjustment process is implied in the medium-tem targets of theFiscal Management (Responsibilitt,) Act (FMRAl. Fiscal

consolidation would pave the way for monetary policy to

operate effectively in containing monetary expansion andmaintaining price stability. To contain further monetary

expansion, the growth of its major components, namely, private

sector credit and net credit to the government, needs to be

restrained. The expansion of credit to the private sector from

banks has to be curtailed in a manner that is not harmful to

private investment while government borrowing from the

banking sector has to be reduced. The continuation of the

flexible exchange rate regime will prevent the build up of any

destabilising forces.t The current high international oil prices may cause a

destabilising effect unless long-term solutions are found.

With the increase in thermal power generation in the absence

of other altemate energy sources, the country's dependence on

imports of oil has increased over the years. High oil prices,while exerting significant pressures on the government

budgetary resources, BOP, the exchange rate and inflation,

could further weaken the financial position of the Ceylon

Electricity Board (CEB) and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation(CPC) unless appropriate price adjustments are made to

economise consumption. The country's ability to withstand

pressure from hi-eh oil prices should be strengthened by

adopting appropriate policies within the macroeconomic

framework, developing alternative energy sources, minimizing

Prevalence and Macroeconomic Impact of the Principal Agent Problem and Rent Seeking

Many developed and developing countries suffer fromproblems associated with asymmetric information and,

especially, rent seeking, due to two reasons. First, the non-

public -eoods such as toads, and in bureaucrats and politicians

unduly rewarding special interest groups. The Budget2005highlights that 'ln fact, tax concessions, customs dutyreductiorts, exentptions, VAT rebates; and such other

concessiorts that the business cortutttutily constantl\t seeks and

secures frorn tlrc Treasury, are much more than the entire

more ffiuent and influential secliorts of our comnunity enjoy

inefficient use of fuel, restructuring energy related public

institutions and phasing out wasteful subsidies associated with

high oil prices. In this re-eard, the CEB should develop the

capability to meet the tuture electricity demand of the country,

for otherwise, the hi-eh growth expectations in the medium to

long run would be impeded. Sri Lanka may be fortunate to find

petroleum resources as indicated by a recent seismic survey,

which shows the existence of oil deposits in off-shore areas of

the Western and North-Western regions. However, while those

eftorts are intensified, Sri Lanka has to develop alternative

energy sources and enhance the efficiency oftransportation and

other energy users.e It is necessary to undertake critical structural reforms

urgently since the current state of infrastructure has posed

a serious capacity limitation on continuing growth. A seriesof refbrms would be necessary to develop economic and

supplying those services need to be strengthened and a higher

level of efficiency and accountability has to be ensured. Pricingof services without covering at least the cost of production

forces institutions providing infrastructure tacilities to dependon budgetary support from the govelnment. Independent

protection in one sector raises the cost of production in all

other sectors leading to lower competitiveness of the nation

and hence results in a large economic cost. Poorly targeted

and undue subsidies drive budgetary resources away from

productive investment. Therefore, the general public must be

enlightened about the benefits of free and liberal economic

policies, structural reforms, competition, and the welfare costof protection and subsidies.r Finally, the governmentts dependence on the public sectorinstitutions to enhance service delivery and the domestic
