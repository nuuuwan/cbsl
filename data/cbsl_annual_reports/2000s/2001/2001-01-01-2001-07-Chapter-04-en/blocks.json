The rising cost of living has exerted upward pressure on wages. The falling productivity growth in Sri Lanka, eroding its long-term competitive advantage, is worrisome because of the increasing tendency for cheaper production bases to emerge elsewhere in the world. To improve labour productivity, there is a need for investment in human capital, improve technology and implement equitable performance evaluation and reward systems. .",

    "text": "Industrial sickness is the situation in which an industrial enterprise has accumulated losses exceeding its net worth, and therefore has to depend on frequent infusion of external funds for its sustenance. Industrial sickness and business failures are common phenomena in a market economy. They are often the results of increased competition either due to increased number of supplieis or innovations leading to improved quality, or reduced costs. The sickness could also arise as a result of market rigidities, unfair trading practices, infrastructure bottlenecks and failure in policy co-ordination. The latter class of problems could be solved by active government intervention, but the former is the market's own way of causing natural selection, as Joseph Schumpetcr put it, through 'creative destruction'. However, even in the case of creative destruction, the existing rules and regulations should provide flexibility to restructure a firm's operations and reuse its capital effectively and efficiently.",

The magnitude and incidence of industrial sickness arc matters for serious concern for the government and the entire banking and financial system of the country, because a systemic sickness could undermine public confidence in the economy with serious repercussions on the overall investment climate of the economy. Therefore, it is necessary to find out the root cause or causes of industrial sickness and take necessary and suitable remedial measures in time to overcome the sickness. It will be less costly and less damaging, if the symptoms of sickness are diagnosed timely at the incipient stage and treated promptly. Remedial measures should first concentrate on causes that commonly affect all industries and then on specific causes affecting individual industrial units.",

The situation was further aggravated by the increased competition from other overseas, suppliers to these markets, the growing trend of preferential trade in the world and increased exports by new low cost entrants to the global market. Several US importers shifted their procurement from Asian countries to Mexico, a beneficiary by way of tariff-free status in garment exports under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Mexico has now become the leading supplier of garments to USA. Similarly, countries in the Caribbean region and more recently, sub Saharan African countries, have been given duty free and quota free access into the US market, thereby reducing the share of Asian countries in that market. As mentioned earlier, the geographical proximity of Eastern European countries to western markets and Turkey's entry into the EU have increased competition for Asian garment exports into the EU market.",

Continuous growth in the flour based food-processing industry and changes in the food habits, especially in urban areas, boosted the demand for wheat flour. The liberalisation of wheat and wheat flour imports in 2001 paved the way for setting up of new flour mills and expanding the existing processing plant. The output of biscuits declined by 3.7 per cent in 2001 due to labour unrest in a major factory. However, some manufacturers introduced new products successfully to the domestic and international markets in 2001. The beverages sub sector grew by 4.7 per cent with higher production in processed tea and fruit processing. Despite the aggressive advertising campaigns, improved distribution methods and the dry weather condition that prevailed in many parts of the country, the output of the soft drink industry declined by 5 per cent.",

During the year, significant investments were made in extensive market research, packaging, promotion and establishment of distribution networks overseas. The output of the hard liquor industry registered a marginal decline in 2001 following the upward revision of prices, which increased the relative prices in favour of illicit liquor. In the hard liquor industry, the introduction of new bottles, labelling and caps has successfully countered the illicit imitation of products manufactured by the leading manufacturers. The output of cigarette declined due to expansion in illicit cigarette production and a sluggish demand resulting from a greater awareness of tobacco related health problems.",

With the downturn in the global economy, the output of the rubber-based industry declined by 10.6 per cent in 2001. The cost of production in the rubber based industry increased substantially in 2001. Cost escalations were higher in latex, energy and other imported inputs. However, the depreciation of rupee softened the impact of cost escalations providing some relief to face the pressure from South East Asian competitors. The strategies adopted in advance by manufacturers to meet the challenges posed by the slower growth expected in 2001 helped to counter negative consequences to a certain extent. These strategies included broadening of the product range to high value added items, improvement of product quality to international standards and computerisation of production processes and controls. Attempts by manufacturers to become the most cost-effective manufacturers in the region continued. A large manufacturer of non-medical rubber gloves received a testing and verification certificate from the Geneva based Society Generate de Surveillance (SGS), a world leader in inspection, testing and verification. This provided an assurance to retailers that suppliers conform to internationally recognised standards covering production quality and process controls, personnel safety and environment practices.",

Two large pharmaceutical manufacturing firms merged in 2001 for mutual benefits. This merger is expected to bring in several advantages including pooling of research and development resources, reduction in sales promotion costs and reduction in price competition in the market. The output of the soap and detergent industry also declined in 2001 due to depressed market conditions. In order to encourage consumer demand, manufacturers adopted several strategies. These included, market segmentation, and discounts and sales promotions through aggressive advertising. Some manufacturers in the detergent industry benefited from the market segmentation. Mini-packs of toothpaste, shampoo and perfume, with special prices, were supplied to the market, aimed at lower income consumers. One large firm in the soap manufacturing industry began to export'soap chips' to India in 2001 for the first time. With the implementation of FTA, Sri Lanka has become a competitive source of soap chips to India, as importers have to pay only 50 per cent of the Indian standard duty rate. In the domestic market, herbal shampoos, soap, lotions and cream have become popular among consumers.",

The lower coconut output due to the drought adversely affected the industry. The Philippines and India are becoming highly competitive producers of activated carbon in international markets. However, the industry saved considerably in energy costs with continuing improvements in the recovery of waste heat for steam generation. The depreciation of rupee also provided some relief.",

The output of concrete products, asbestos and cement registered a moderate growth in 2001 in response to moderate expansion in the construction industry. The ceramic industry continued to suffer from increased competition in international markets. There was a considerable oversupply of ceramic products in the world market with the expansion of factories in China and Eastern European countries. The factories in the Eastern European countries had competitive advantages in the EU market due to lower tariff rates, geographical proximity and shorter lead-time. In the US market, there is a new trend where consumers prefer for more casual 'in-glaze' tableware to traditional high standard items. This trend has created a pressure for gold and silver decorated high quality products manufactured in Sri Lanka. With this changing market environment, Chinese manufacturers, with their ability to offer average quality products at lower prices, were at an advantage. Rising costs of electricity, diesel, gas, imported raw material and labour reduced competitiveness, but depreciation of rupee helped the industry to a certain extent. In order to regain export competitiveness, major ceramic manufacturers focused more on entering new markets and reducing costs. Some manufacturers expanded sales in the domestic market through image building campaigns, improving marketing links, introducing sub brands and through other means of sales promotion. As a part of the promotion strategy, manufacturers held a number of workshops and seminars in various parts of",

The rise in the cost of production, caused by the higher costs of imported raw materials, increased fuel, electricity and telecommunication prices and high interest rates adversely affected the profitability of industries. The surcharge on import duties and corporate tax and the increase in the defence levy, exerted further downward pressures on the profit margins. However, a fraction of the cost increases was passed down to consumers. In the case of export oriented and imports substitution industries, the depreciation of rupee softened the pressure on declining profit margins. The pressure on profit margins also eased on account of waste reduction, energy saving, better use of raw materials, improved procurement procedures and outsourcing of production. Manufacturers also paid more attention to improve the efficiency of managing working capital to reduce short-term borrowing and thereby to reduce interest costs.

The difficult market environment encountered by the manufacturers reduced the pressure and thereby contained the growth of the wage bill. The overtime bill in the apparel industry declined with lower capacity utilisation. Some manufacturers paid only half a month's salary and requested employees to stay at home due to reduced export orders. Many companies adopted the strategy of out-sourcing of high cost units to reduce the total wage bill. The voluntary retirement schemes introduced by a few companies also had beneficial effects on reducing the total wage bill. Stringent labour laws and seasonal production requirements encouraged manufacturers to recruit contract and casual labour reducing the upward pressure on wage bill. The wage bill as a",

However, some manufacturers offered attractive voluntary retirement schemes to retrench excess labour while others removed excess contract and casual labour in order to face the difficult market environment. The modernisation of factories with automated systems also reduced the labour requirement of the industrial sector. The employment in the industrial categories of textiles, wearing apparel and leather products; chemical, rubber and plastic products and non-metallic mineral products declined in 2001 reflecting the lower capacity utilisation.

An investment delegation visited USA and met key members of the American Apparel Manufacturers' Association, US Apparel Importers Association, the Deputy Secretary of State and senior executives of leading companies and the US Chamber of Commerce.

Another programme named 'Wasanthaya' was also introduced during this period with the objective of promoting small and medium industrial enterprises. This programme targets youth who possess entrepreneurial ability or who have initiated small enterprises, which have potential for development. In addition, a Business/Industry Incubators Programme launched by the Ministry of Industrial Development during the year provided infrastructure facilities and communication facilities to small and medium scale industries.

Of these, 127 applications had been considered for relief measures, while 3 applications were being processed. By end 2001, the total debt outstanding of around Rs.4,003 million had been identified for transfer to the Textile Debt Recovery Fund (TDRF). Upon finalisation of the Tripartite Agreement for Debt Recovery, the total debt outstanding of 108 manufacturers amounting to Rs.3,381 million, was transferred to theTDRF, by the end of the year. By end 2001, 111 enterprises had submitted restructuring/modernisation proposals, of which 34 enterprises have been endorsed by their banks for financial facilities required for the implementation of restructuring/modernisation proposals. The banks/financial institutions granted loan facilities amounting to Rs.222.5 million to these 34 enterprises to implement their restructuring/ modernisation proposals. During the year, the Domestic Textile Allocation Committee, functioning under the Ministry of Enterprise Development, Industrial Policy and Investment Promotion and Constitutional Affairs, allocated textile quota among four domestic textile manufacturers including a BOI approved manufacturer for about 7.5 million meters of fabric materials. Under this programme, steps were taken to implement an interest subsidy scheme for eligible textile manufacturers and to set up a committee to monitor the restructuring/modernisation programmes undertaken by the enterprises. Domestic textile manufacturers who did not qualify for any relief measures under the restructuring programme were permitted to import project related machinery, equipment, spare parts inputs and accessories for the textile industry, on a duty free basis.",

With a view to implementing effectively productivity related activities at the national level, NPS appointed Productivity Liaison Officers in almost all the ministries to co-ordinate productivity improvement activities in ministries as well as departments coming under the purview of those ministries. NPS also initiated a programme to collect information through case studies in selected public and private sector institutions regarding the level of success in the implementation of productivity programmes. The monthly lecture series on productivity that gained wide popularity among private sector managers provided an opportunity to share hands-on experience on widespread application of productivity concepts. Recognising the importance of educating school children on productivity, the National Institute of Education in consultation with the NPS formulated a Teachers' Guide Book to introduce productivity concepts into the school curriculum. Advanced approaches for productivity improvement such as Total Quality Management (TQM), Bench Marking, Change Management, and Business Process Re-engineering are being contemplated and designed by the NPS to enhance individual and institutional capabilities to achieve high total productivity.",
