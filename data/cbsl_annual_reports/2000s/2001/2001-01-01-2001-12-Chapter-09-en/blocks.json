    "text": "The global external environment deteriorated significantly in 2001. The world economy weakened after the strong performance in 2000. The slowdown was marked by a sharp weakening in the United States, which spearheaded the global economic growth during the past decade, a still fragile economy in Japan, a moderation in growth in the European Union and a significant slowdown in the Newly Industrialised Asian Economies and the ASEAN-4.1 The drop in demand in industrial countries, particularly in major export markets for developing countries, had adverse repercussions on international trade and growth prospects of developing countries, including Sri Lanka. External sector developments in Sri Lanka during 2001 reflected the adverse global external environment, external shocks, and the uncertain political and economic environment in the country.. However, the adverse effects of these developments were mitigated by the country's move to a freely floating exchange rate system in January, 2001.",

    "text": "A sharp decline in international trade in goods and services, significantly lower trade and current account deficits in the balance of payments, a surplus in the overall balance in the balance of payments resulting in a corresponding increase in official external reserves, and a depreciation of the rupee, are the highlights in the external sector developments in 2001. Sri Lanka's external trade dropped significantly by 16 per cent, in response to the sharp decline in global demand. Exports declined by 12.8 per cent, and imports by 14.9 per cent (18.4 per cent without adjustments for the import of aircraft in 2000), resulting in a favourable outcome in the trade deficit, which declined from 10.7 per cent of GDP in 2000 to 7.3 per cent in 2001. The drop in exports was mainly reflected in textiles and garment (14.7 per cent), other industrial products (10.3 per cent) and agricultural products (7.2 per cent). The drop in textile and garment exports alone accounted for over 62 per cent of the decline in total exports. This exhibits the vulnerability of emerging market economies, such as Sri Lanka, to adverse external trade shocks and impels a re-examination of the country's export strategy in two dimensions. First, the concentration of exports in one or two major export markets makes Sri Lanka highly vulnerable to shocks in those markets. The",

    "text": "United States, the largest export market for Sri Lanka's garments, accounts for about 64 per cent, while the European Union for about 30 per cent, exposing Sri Lanka to adverse developments in these two markets. Secondly, the country's over dependence on garment exports (garments exports account for over 50 per cent of total exports), makes it highly vulnerable to adverse changes in that sector. These concerns are particularly relevant as the Multifiber Arrangement (MFA) will be phased out by 2005. In a highly trade dependent country like Sri Lanka (with a trade/GDP ratio of over 70 per cent), the risks of over exposure need to be minimised by diversifying exports not only to strengthen the resilience of the economy, but also to exploit its comparative advantage, while keeping in line with changing global market trends.",

The large drop in investment goods throughout the year was a major concern, as it would retard future economic growth prospects. One of the favourable developments of the global slowdown was the drop in crude oil prices, by over 15 per cent during the year, which had a significant positive impact on Sri Lanka's balance of payments. The drop in consumer goods imports was mainly consequent upon the surcharge on non-essential consumer goods imports as a fiscal measure, weak domestic demand and the suspension of the facility given for public servants to import motor vehicles on concessionary terms.",

Excluding this inflow, the surplus in the services account dropped by nearly 50 per cent during the year, mainly due to a decrease of 15.5 per cent in receipts from tourism and a slowdown in earnings from related services. Net income payments declined by 8 per cent as the sharp drop in global interest rates reduced interest payments on external debt. Meanwhile, net current transfers declined by 4 per cent, as net private transfers were reduced after the completion in 2000 of compensation payments to workers affected by the Gulf War. Excluding this special item, net private transfer receipts recorded a marginal increase. As a result of these",

Meanwhile, the real effective exchange rate of the Sri Lanka rupee against a five currency basket, (i.e. a basket comprising the US dollar, the sterling pound, the Japanese yen, the Deutsche mark and the Indian rupee), appreciated by 1.4 per cent reflecting a higher domestic inflation rate compared with trade partner and competitor countries.",

Total export earnings, which grew by 3 per cent during the first four months of 2001, began to decline after May 2001 following the economic slowdown in major export markets, particularly, USA and the European Union (EU). The attacks at the Katunayake International Airport and later in USA, and increased competition from Sub Saharan countries for garment exports markets, supported by special tariff concessions, worsened the situation. The impact was felt in all major categories of exports. The recession in the Japanese economy also weakened the market for Sri Lanka's exports, particularly, prawns, other fish produces, gems, jewellery and diamonds. Despite high demand from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and some European countries, tea prices continued to decline from January 2001 as the global economy slowed down and the supply from major producing countries increased.",

Sri Lanka reported a harvest of 2,796 million nuts in 2001 compared to 3,096 million nuts (decline of 10 per cent) in 2000 due to unfavourable weather. The lower production of nuts resulted in lower quantities of coconut oil and desiccated coconut exports. In 2000, when coconut oil prices were low, the government decided to impose a 25 per cent surcharge on the prevailing 25 per cent duty on 17 July 2000 to reduce competition from imported edible oils. This surcharge was changed to a specific surcharge of Rs. 20 per kg for the period 12 January - 31 December 2001 even when production shortfalls and higher prices prevailed in the market. As a result, imports of edible oil declined by 17.3 million kg in 2001 putting further pressure on domestic coconut prices. Responding to lower supply in the market, prices for fresh nuts (retail price) increased by about 12 per cent over 2000 thus increasing the cost of inputs to the coconut oil and desiccated coconut industry. World production of other edible oils such as soya bean, corn, olive and palm oil increased and helped to reduce the prices of close substitutes.",

Earnings from cinnamon exports declined due to lower prices which offset the positive impact of increased volume. Cinnamon prices continued to remain low throughout the year but the export quantities were higher except in the second quarter when prices were relatively low. This compelled producers to hold back their production. Earnings from un-manufactured tobacco declined by 6 per cent due to lower prices and lower demand from Austria, Belgium, UK and Spain. Cloves became a significant commodity among minor agricultural product in 2001. Prices of cloves remained steady throughout the year due to high demand from India.

    "text": "exporters had over producers in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Despite those negative developments, Sri Lanka continued to supply top quality blue sapphires of natural colour to the world market and the prices of these products grew steadily during the year. Demand for calibrated blue, pink and yellow sapphires in the European and USA markets remained stable during the early half of the year. Demand from USA for rubies and sapphires remained stable. Hong Kong has emerged as the centre for fine gems and jewellery in the Asia pacific region. Japan also continued to be a major market for Sri Lankan gems while Switzerland, France, UK and Germany were among the major buyers in the European market. On the supply side, the removal of the suspension imposed on the auction of government and estate owned lands for gem mining, resulted in improving the supply of raw gems in 2001. Earnings from other mineral exports grew by 26 per cent due to higher earnings from metallic ores and iron pyrites.",

An improvement in the domestic supply of rice and other food items helped to contain the food imports. Expansion in the industrial sector required higher imports of intermediate goods while improvements in infrastructure facilities and the construction and transport sectors, combined with increased use of advanced technology, increased imports of investment goods. The import structure in 2001 showed a marginal shift towards consumer goods reflecting the slower economic activity. When compared with 2000, the relative importance of intermediate and investment goods together declined from 75 per cent (without aircraft) to 74 per cent, while consumer goods increased from 20 per cent to 21 per cent. The share of other imports (including defence related imports) remained at the same level as in 2000.",

Imports of food items continued to increase till July 2001 and then started to decline at an increasing rate, resulting in a drop of 5 per cent in food and drink imports. Food items were not affected seriously by the imposition of the surcharge on imports as essential food items were excluded from the surcharge. Wheat grain imports declined to 760,416 metric tons in 2001 compared with 921,653 metric tons in 2000. Even when a shipment containing 58,513 metric tons of wheat, which was expected in December 2001 but arrived in January 2002, is taken into account, wheat imports were low due to depressed demand from the local bakery and confectionery industry and the reduction in domestic stocks. Although flour imports increased to 34,706 metric tons in 2000 after the liberalisation of wheat and flour imports at end February 2000, they declined to 6,338 metric tons in 2001. Sugar imports too declined due to relatively higher international prices. Despite the reduction in the rice harvest, the government continued to keep the import of rice under import control after 21 July 2000, limiting the importation of rice only to high quality varieties. Rice imports were liable to a 35 per cent import duty until the government announced a duty waiver on rice imports on 22 November 2001 as domestic prices rose. During the first eleven months of 2001, rice imports amounted to 12,810 metric tons; in December 2001, 39,133 metric tons were imported. Lower income levels and higher domestic prices reduced the demand for milk and fish products. Potato imports were low due to high import duties and increased local production. Import of onions, chillies and other food items was low due to the higher cost of imports on account of the import surcharge.",

Prices of crude oil declined gradually and were relatively low during the last quarter of 2001 compared with the pervious year. The volume of crude oil imports declined from 17.3 million barrels in 2000 to 14.4 million barrels in 2001, due to the routine closure of the petroleum refinery for about five weeks in 2001. The average price of crude oil declined from US dollars 28.77 per barrel to US dollars 24.47 per barrel (15 per cent) between these two years. Despite the higher import of refined products to meet domestic requirements, lower prices reduced the cost of these imports by 6 per cent. Consequently, the total cost of petroleum products declined by 19 per cent. However, intermediate goods imports excluding petroleum products, declined by 10 per cent responding to negative growth in the industrial sector.",

Other intermediate goods imports declined by 10 per cent, marked by lower imports of inputs for soap, garments, chemicals and rubber based manufacturing industries. Imports of edible oils declined considerably due to the imposition of the surcharge on these items from 17 July 2000.",

This was mainly the result of a sharp decrease in receipts from tourism after the July attack, further aggravated by the September 11 attack on several strategic places in the US. Receipts from tourism, which recovered strongly during the first half of the year with a growth of 11 per cent, declined by 44 per cent during the second half to drop by 15.5 per cent during the year. Meanwhile, despite an increase of 2.5 per cent in transshipment cargo handling, transportation service receipts declined by 2 per cent, as the volume of international trade fell.

Private transfer receipts, excluding these payments in 2000, reflected an increase of 1 per cent, a sharp moderation from the previous year's 18 per cent growth. This decrease is attributed to the drop in income in oil exporting countries because of lower oil prices during the year and the political uncertainty in the West Asian region in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks on the US, and the war in Afghanistan. Private transfer receipts, at US dollar 1,125 million in 2001, the second largest foreign exchange earner after net garment exports, were sufficient to cover almost the entirety of the deficit in the trade account and 85 per cent of the deficit in the goods, services and income accounts.",

    "text": "Meanwhile, FDI flows to Sri Lanka faced a major setback in 2001 due to a host of factors including adverse external environment, security concerns and the uncertain political environment, particularly during the latter part of the year. Gross FDI inflows, at US dollars 82 million, reflected a drop of 52 per cent in 2001. In the fourth quarter the inflow was no more than US dollars 2 million. The inflow of FDI was mainly for power (27 per cent), textiles, wearing apparel and leather products (22 per cent), chemicals (21 per cent) and communications (12 per cent). The textile and garments sector continued to attract a major share of foreign direct investment flows to the country. As highlighted before, this sector is vulnerable to external shocks. The continued encouragement of foreign investment in the apparel sector could make matters worse in the years to come, particularly with the phasing out of the MFA in 2005. Moreover, unless Sri Lanka progresses from being an apparel exporter, to focus on the fast growing sectors, in particular, information technology sector and manufacturing, it may be difficult to move to a sustainable higher growth path. As such, it is desirable to re-examine the country's investment promotion policy to maximize capital inflows and diversify investments into sectors that will bring faster economic growth in a competitive global environment while strengthening the resilience of the economy.",

This provides more investment opportunities for investors in countries where savings exceed investment enabling them to earn a higher rate of return on their investments. Conversely, this process fills the investment-savings gap of countries where domestic savings arc not sufficient to finance all the investment required to achieve the desired rate of economic development. If this process operates according to the principles of market forces, both parties, i.e., the investor country and investment recipient country, would be better off. In order to exploit the advantages of this process, resource poor countries should build up confidence in investors that their investment would generate a higher risk adjusted rate of return. This basic principle explains to a large extent why some of the countries in East Asia had been able to attract steady and continuous flows of foreign savings over long periods of time before the recent crisis and achieve \"miracle\" growth, while most African countries still depend on official development assistance from developed countries and inter-governmental institutions. Most of these countries also allowed free movement of capital, which boosted investor confidence. In fact, with the rapid economic development in these countries over a long period, some of them gradually became net capital providers from being net capital recipients.",

During the East Asian Crisis, the worst hit countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and South Korea experienced huge capital outflows within a short time period. However, some countries such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan weathered the crisis fairly well. It has been argued that the differences in their responses to the crisis arc largely attributed to differences in the degree of soundness of the financial system. Strong investor confidence, which attracted large capital inflows, was common to all countries in the region. However, the financial systems of some of the countries, were not sound and adequately regulated. Capital inflows moved into unprofitable speculative activities such as real estate causing asset price bubbles. These countries were most affected by the crisis. In these countries, liberalisation of the domestic financial sector was not complemented with adequately strong prudential regulation and supervision, permitting in an increase in weak financial institutions.

In a crisis situation, countries have the right to impose necessary controls to avoid any adverse impacts. Malaysia imposed selected controls to reduce destabilising effects of volatile short-lem capital movements during the crisis. IMF's Article VI of the Articles of Agreement also allows member countries to regulate international capital movements without imposing restrictions on the current account. Therefore, any further liberalisation of the capital account docs not imply that restrictions cannot be re-imposed, if necessary.

Addressing these issues is vital for the effective utilisation of concessional foreign assistance, particularly at a time when the resources available on concessional terms and conditions are shrinking.

It is essential to streamline aid utilisation procedures if debt service payments are to be kept at sustainable levels.

The risk premium is determined by the uncertainty in the economy, the volatility in the foreign exchange market, swap cost, administration and transaction costs, whether the commercial bank has excess foreign exchange or is short, the amount of the contract and credibility of the customer.",

The forward market was particularly inactive in the last quarter of 2000 and in the first half of 2001. The uncertainty in the foreign exchange market in the latter part of 2000 greatly reduced forward transactions. Similarly, the precautionary measures introduced with the flotation of the Rupee in January 2001, although provided stability to the foreign exchange market discouraged forward market activity. The relaxation of most of these precautionary measures subsequently activated operations and expanded forward market activity.",

If the difference between today's forward rate and tomorrow's spot rate were known, the unpredictable component of the forward premium would disappear. In a managed floating exchange rate regime, this difference would be narrower and the market would be able to predict the future spot rate more accurately, as spot rates would be adjusted by central banks to avoid significant volatility. Immediately after the flotation of the rupee, the unpredictable component of the forward rate became much larger and the difference between the one-month forward rate and the spot rate on the maturing day of the one-month forward transaction was positive, thereby indicating a higher depreciation of the exchange rate than expected at the time of the forward contract.",

Accordingly, the relationship between uncertainty and the volume of forward contracts depends on which forces dominate the market (i.e. supply or demand). The Sri Lankan experiences during the last one and half years has been in line with this theory. When uncertainty arises, the difference between the forward premium and the interest differential increases and the volume of forward transactions becomes smaller. It is evident that the foreign exchange forward market is dominated by suppliers and the supply side has become the crucial factor for the development of the market in Sri Lanka. Conversely, when uncertainty decreases, the premium depends mainly on the interest differential and the increase in the volume of forward transactions.",

The increase in the net open position, initially to 10 per cent of capital and reserves on March 2001 and subsequently to 15 per cent on March 2002 would have helped develop the forward market. Another prudential measure that restricted the activities of the forward market was the requirement of a fifty per cent rupee deposit to back the commercial bank's forward sales of foreign exchange to their customers. Although this restriction helped remove speculative forward dealings, it also discouraged forward contracts among participants in the foreign exchange market. The effect of the subsequent removal of the margin was clearly seen in the increase in forward transactions.",

This was the outcome of a reduction in concessional debt of the central government by 3 per cent and an increase in commercial debt by 10 per cent, due to an increase in defence related trade credit. Meanwhile, government guaranteed debt of public corporations and the private sector declined by 28 per cent, mainly due to a technical amortisation of the debt of SriLankan Airlines (US dollars 148 million) on account of the remaining capital value of the two aircraft destroyed in July 2001.

In 2001, the number of policies and guarantees in force was 205 compared to 296 in force at end December 2000. These included whole turnover export payments insurance policies, specific policies, small scale insurance policies, policies covering entrepot trade, computer software and special schemes for exports to Iraq. There were 49 new insurance policies issued in 2001 amounting to Rs.500 million as against 35 policies in 2000. New guarantees in force at end 2001 amounted to 1,672 to the value Rs.2,485 million. A few insurance policies were in place for new and small scale exporters enabling them to compete in international markets with confidence. A special insurance cover for tea exports to Iraq, which was launched by SLECIC in 2000, provided four insurance policies to the value of Rs. 150 million in 2001.",

Seminars were conducted for potential exporters to gain knowledge of these markets, trade promotion missions were sent to these countries and trade delegations from China and Malaysia visited Sri Lanka. The trade promotion office of EDB in Male commenced a pilot project in order to create a demand for Sri Lankan products in the Maldives. The Maldives was the second largest export destination for Sri Lanka's products among the SAARC region. Regional e-commerce centres have been established in Galle, Matara, Hambantota, Kandy and Kurunegala to assist small and medium scale exporters to find and communicate with business partners, finalise contracts and sell their products to international customers via the Internet. EDB continued to provide advice and assistance to exporters to resolve various operational problems relating to sea and airfreight-and entrepot trade. Awareness programmes and seminars were conducted on e-commerce, import/export procedures, export packaging and on quality circles.

Despite the global trend of bringing down the basic freight rates, the average freight rates that shippers have to pay at Sri Lanka's ports increased due to upward revisions of existing charges and new charges imposed by the shipping lines. Among the existing charges, the terminal handling charge was increased by 33 per cent (from US dollar 86 to US dollars 115 per 20 foot container and US dollars 138 to US dollars 184 per 40 foot container) on 1 May 2001 to meet increasing operational cost. The bunkering adjustment charge was increased by 50 per cent ( for USA, from US dollars 70 to US dollars 105 per 20 foot container and for UK, from US dollars 50 to US dollars 75 per 20 foot container) during the year. Adding an additional burden, a war risk surcharge came into effect after the attack at the Katunayake International Airport. War risk surcharges of US dollar 350 and US dollar 700 were levied for 20 foot and 40 foot containers, respectively, with effect from the first week of August 2001. Following the September attacks in USA, a war risk surcharge of US dollars. 150 per 20 foot container and US dollars 300 per 40 foot container was levied on all West-bound cargo. In addition, a levy of US dollars 10 per container as a Suez Emergency Surcharge was also levied on those ships transiting through the Suez",

The strong shipping lines within the consortia were able to survive with lower freight rates but certain lines in the Far East were unable to survive in this competitive environment. The size of the ships too increased gradually to almost 6,000 to 8,000 twenty foot containers, where the capital investments were very high. As these shipping lines had to be competitive to find sufficient cargo to operate at full capacity, there was a tendency to bring down the freight rates. The international freight rates have not stabilised due to; various ancillary charges imposed by shipping lines to recoup the earnings forgone due to lower charges. However, freight rates are expected to stabilise at a lower level when most strong shipping lines join up in mega consortia in the long run.",

At this meeting member countries endorsed the proposal for the revitalisation of Bangkok Agreement. This move was considered useful since Bangkok Agreement has not contributed much to expand trade among its member countries during its 25 years of existence. It was decided to launch the third round trade negotiations under Bangkok Agreement at the meeting.

Decisions taken by the WTO at this meeting to grant flexibility to developing countries to provide domestic support and protection on grounds of food security, livelihood concerns and rural development and extension granted under Article 27.4 of the WTO agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures allow Sri Lanka to continue with subsidies. Sri Lanka will also be a beneficiary from tariff reduction by developed countries on agricultural products and certain industrial products. This would create greater market access for developing countries for their agricultural products and industrial products such as garments and leather products. Sri Lanka will also benefit from the establishment of a work programme under the auspices of the General Councils of the WTO to examine specific problems of small and vulnerable economies. This group will make recommendations at the next Ministerial Conference to solve problems particular to small and vulnerable economies and this will help such economies to obtain tariff concessions from developed countries. The Doha declaration in respect of the WTO Agreement on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) would let Sri Lanka protect Sri Lankan products such as Ceylon tea of Sri Lankan origin under geographical indications. It would also allow countries to override patents in the interest of public health with enhanced scope to add tuberculosis, malaria and other epidemics in addition to the AIDS/HIV catastrophe. Under this, a WTO member could grant compulsory licences and allow parallel imports in respect of cheaper medicine.",

Under this plan major initiatives were taken to have foreign countries withdraw travel warnings and lower the insurance risk premium imposed by foreign airlines and shipping lines. The government introduced a relief package in 2001 to cover temporary difficulties faced by industrialists by way of rescheduling loans and interest payments. This included a moratorium on the repayment of capital and interest due for the period commencing 1 August 2001 up to 31 March 2002, capitalisation of loan repayment into a new loan or extending the repayment period or capitalisation of deferred interest. Loans were rescheduled on a case by case basis. As a result of efforts by the government and industrialists, most of the adverse travel advisories were withdrawn or modified and a slowdown in the rate of decline in monthly tourist arrivals was observed towards the end of 2001.",

SriLankan Airlines brought in 55 per cent of the tourists in 2001, compared with 51 per cent in 2000. This improvement was a reflection of the better performance in the first half of year with the addition of six new aircraft to the fleet in 1999 and 2000. The introduction of two new direct flights to Australia and Sweden in November 2000 by SriLankan Airlines too helped to increase arrivals from these two sources. During the first half of 2001, tourists travelling by SriLankan Airlines increased by 25 per cent. The number of tourists travelling by SriLankan Airlines declined by 41 per cent during the latter half of 2001 recording a negative growth of 9 per cent for the year as a whole. However, its relative importance increased due to fewer operations of other airlines after the attack on the Airport in July. The share of charter flights declined from 7 per cent in 2000 to 3 per cent in 2001.",

The Bureau participated in several international campaigns, promoting Sri Lanka as a destination for MICE tourism in Asia.

Sri Lanka served as the lead country in tourism in the BIMST-EC since 1998. At the fourth Ministerial, meeting of the BIMST-EC held in Yangoon, Myanmar in December 2001, Sri Lanka relinquished its lead role in tourism to accept the lead role in the technology sector. However, an action plan prepared by BIMST-EC for the tourism sector is in place. Under the activities of the Indian Ocean Rim Academic Group, Sri Lanka has undertaken a joint study with India for promoting tourism in IOR-ARC. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs through diplomatic mission in Beijing and the Chinese Embassy in Colombo has been actively pursuing the designation of Sri Lanka by China as an official tourist destination, to facilitate the visit of Chinese tourists to Sri Lanka.",
