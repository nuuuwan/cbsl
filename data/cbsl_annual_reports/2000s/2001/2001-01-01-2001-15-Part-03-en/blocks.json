Therefore, in the interest of the depositors and to stabilise the foreign exchange market, it is considered necessary to streamline the operations in the forward market in foreign exchange, pending the development of an efficient forward market. Hence, both from a prudential standpoint and from considerations relating to the stability of the foreign exchange market, it is desirable that forward foreign exchange contracts by banks with their customers should, for the time being, be in respect of transactions concerning payments and receipts in foreign exchange relating to trade in goods and services and for a period reasonably adequate to meet the needs of trade transactions.",
