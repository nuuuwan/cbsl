Dear Sir,

IDA CR. No. 3014 CE - MINISTRY OF EDUCATION - GENERAL EDUCATION PROJECT - 2

The following procedure should be observed in respect of imports under the captioned loan granted to Sri Lanka by the International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank.

1. Imports shall be against confirmed irrevocable without recourse Letters of Credit established by your bank on behalf of Project Director, General Education Project-2, Ministry of Education, "Isurupaya", Battaramulla.

2. Your bank's authority for opening Letters of Credit will be the letters of allocation issued by the Director General of External Resources under the title "IDA Cr. 3014 CE - General Education Project-2".

3. Every Letter of Credit opened by your bank, unless otherwise advised by me, should provide that the negotiating bank will be reimbursed by IDA and that the Letter of Credit will become operative only when IDA issues its special commitment in favour of the negotiating bank.

4. Applications for Special Commitment to IDA should be made by your customer on Form 1931 (extract attached) supported by the following documents:

(a) a copy of the contract or purchase order related to the payment to be made; and

(b) two copies of the Letter of Credit your bank proposes to issue.

5. The negotiating bank should be advised to furnish copies of all amendments made to each Letter of Credit to IDA which will provide its written approval for amendments involving:

(a) the value of the Letter of Credit;

(b) the description or quantity of goods ;

(c) the beneficiary; and

(d) any extension of the expiry date of the Letter of Credit more than six months beyond the original date or beyond the date quoted in the special commitment issued by IDA.

No other amendments require IDA's prior approval.

6. Since the captioned line of credit is denominated in Special Drawing Rights (SDR), the IDA will specify the SDR commitment in its special commitment letters to the negotiating bank in respect of Letters of

( v i )

Credit expressed in another currency. If due to this limitation of its commitment, IDA does not reimburse the full amount of the foreign currency to your correspondent bank abroad as specified in the Letter of Credit, you may remit the balance due to the negotiating bank in accordance with the instructions issued to you in this regard by the Controller of Exchange.

7. Importers under this credit are not required to pay the Sri Lanka rupee value of the shipping documents involved to the Government's Counterpart Fund Account. You may, therefore, release such docu­ments to your customers no sooner they are received by your bank after recovering commissions, charges etc., if any, due to your bank or to the negotiating bank.

8. Copies of Letters of Credit and amendments, if any should be forwarded to the Chief Account­ant, Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Colombo, for information.

9. Controller of Exchange will advise you separately of his requirements in this connection.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,

ADB LOAN No. 1575 SRI (SF) 3rd WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR PROTECT PROCEDURE FOR IMPORTS

The Asian Development Bank (hereinafter referred to as ADB) has agreed to lend to the Government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, an amount equivalent to SDR 54,937,000 (Fifty Four Million Nine Hundred and Thirty Seven Thousand only) for a 3rd Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project which will be executed by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (hereinafter referred to as NWSDB) who will utilize a part of the credit for the importation of equipment for the project. You are required to observe the following procedure in dealing with imports under this project.

2. All imports which must be from eligible source countries as shown in Annexure I, should be made against confirmed, irrevocable, without recourse Letters of Credit established by your bank on applica­tion made by NWSDB. Every such Letter of Credit should contain the following clause:

" This Letter of Credit is established under Asian Development Bank Loan No. 1575 SRI(SF) and becomes effective only if and when Asian Development Bank issues its commitment letter to the advising/confirming bank. For payment, please follow the instructions contained in the said commitment letter".

Even if the above mentioned clause is not incorporated in the Letter of Credit, it will immediately become operative on the strength of your bank's commitment to finance the transaction. However, the ADB's commitment if and when issued, will shift the financing commitment to the ADB. In such case, the Letter of Credit should contain the following clause :

"The financing of this Letter of Credit is undertaken by Bank of Ceylon, Corporate Branch, Colombo, Sri Lanka. However, it is established under Asian Development Bank Loan No. 1575 SRI(SF), and if and when Asian Development Bank issues the commitment letter to the advising/confirming bank, the latter shall follow the instruc­tions contained in the said commitment letter, and claim payment/reimbursement from Asian Development Bank".

Two copies of your Letter of Credit should be sent to NWSDB who will arrange to have the ADB issue its formal letter of commitment to your bank's correspondent. If the ADB agrees to the NWSDB's request it will issue a formal commitment letter to the designated commercial bank in the form shown in Annexure 2 to this letter.

3. (i) ADB's written approval is required for any amendments to the Letter of Credit involving :

(a) terms of payment including currency & amount of the Letter of Credit;

Banking Department

5th September, 2001

(b) the description or quantity of goods;

(c) the beneficiary;

(d) the country of origin; and

(e) extension of the expiry date of the Letter of Credit beyond the closing date i.e. 30th June, 2005 for withdrawal from the Loan Account.

Amendments not covered under (a) to (e) above do not require ADB's approval. Requests for approval of amendments mentioned above should be made promptly by the NWSDB on the form shown in Annexure 3 to this letter accompanied by one copy of the amendment signed by you. The amendment of a Letter of Credit in such cases should include the following provision:-

"This amendment shall become effective when it is approved by ADB"

The ADB's approval, if given, will be communicated to your bank's correspondent as well as to the NWSDB on the form shown in Annexure 4 to this letter.

(ii) The expiry date and the shipping date may be extended up to the closing date for withdrawal from the Loan Account without ADB's prior approval. When such extension has been made, NWSDB should promptly inform ADB of such extension in the form shown in Annexure 3 to this letter attaching one copy of the extension duly signed by an authorized officer of your bank. Two copies of every amendment, whether subject to ADB's prior approval or not, should be sent by your bank to NWSDB who will arrange, where necessary, for the ADB's approval to be issued.

4. On making payment to the beneficiary in terms of a Letter of Credit in respect of which a letter of commitment has been issued by the ADB, your bank's correspondent should forward the relevant documents to your bank and request reimbursement from ADB in the form shown in Annexure 5 of this letter. Your bank's correspondent should also forward a copy of the request for reimbursement to NWSDB. In order to facilitate prompt disbursement, your bank's correspondent may send an authenticated SWIFT, telex or cable request to the ADB in the form shown in Annexure 6 to this letter. Arrangements should be made with the correspondent to advise your bank as expeditiously as possible about the receipt of reimbursement from ADB, and the shipping documents should be retained until confirmation of such reimbursement has been received. No Counterpart Funds are to be collected from the NWSDB at the time of releasing the documents.

5. In case there is any discrepancy between the shipping documents and the terms of a Letter of Credit, the ADB will not be in a position to honour the payment claim. Neither will it be in a position to accept a Letter of Indemnity issued or endorsed by (Negotiating) commercial bank. In such an event, the negotiating commercial bank should seek through your bank the NWSDB's authorization to make such payment despite any discrepancy.

The NWSDB after authorizing the payment in consultation with your bank, should inform ADB by cable of the discrepancy and of the payment authorization given to the negotiating bank.

6. Where a commitment is issued by ADB in a currency other than the US Dollar, the commitment letter will specify the US Dollar equivalent determined on the basis of the exchange rate at which the ADB expects the non-US currency to become available for payment under such commitment. If in the case of any particular claim made by any of your bank's correspondents in a non-US Currency, the US Dollar equivalent exceeds the amount available under ADB's commitment, ADB will limit the reimbursement to the non-US Currency equivalent of such US Dollar amount available. If for this reason or for any other reason whatso­ever, ADB declines to reimburse your bank's correspondent in full or in part in respect of a claim made in terms of your Letter of Credit, your bank may remit to your bank's correspondent the amount disallowed by the ADB. You should make necessary arrangements for this purpose with NWSDB.

( i x )

7. The Controller of Exchange will advise your bank regarding Exchange Control requirements in this connection.

8. All your bank's charges should be for account of NWSDB.

2. All licensed commercial banks are hereby informed that Euro currency which was introduced on 01.01.1999 would come into circulation as bank notes and coins on 01.01.2002.

"This Letter of Credit is established under Asian Development Bank Loan No. 1707 SRI(SF) and becomes effective only if and when Asian Development Bank issues its commitment letter to the advising/confirming bank. For payment, please follow the instructions contained in the said commitment letter".

Even if the above mentioned clause is not incorporated in the Letter of Credit, it will immediately become operative on the strength of your bank's commitment to finance the transaction. However, the ADB's commitment if and when issued, will shift the financing commitment to the ADB. In such case, the Letter of Credit should contain the following clause :

"The financing of this Letter of Credit is undertaken by Bank of Ceylon, Metro Imports Department, Colombo, Sri Lanka. However, it is established under Asian Development Bank Loan No. 1707 SRI(SF), and if and when Asian Development Bank issues the commitment letter to the advising/confirming bank, the latter shall follow the instruc­tions contained in the said commitment letter, and claim payment/reimbursement from Asian Development Bank".

Two copies of your Letter of Credit should be sent to MOVTRI who will arrange to have the ADB issue its formal letter of commitment to your bank's correspondent. If the ADB agrees to the MOVTRI's request, it will issue a formal commitment letter to the designated commercial bank in the form shown in Annexure 2 to this letter.

3. (i) ADB's written approval is required for any amendments to the Letter of Credit involving :

(a) terms of payment including currency & amount of the Letter of Credit;

26th December, 2001

(b) the description or quantity of goods;

(c) the beneficiary;

(d) the country of origin; and

(e) extension of the expiry date of the Letter of Credit beyond the closing date i.e. 31st October, 2006 for withdrawal from the Loan Account.

Amendments not covered under (a) to (e) above do not require ADB's approval. Requests for approval of amendments mentioned above should be made promptly by the MOVTRI on the form shown in Annexure 3 to this letter accompanied by one copy of the amendment signed by you. The amendment of a Letter of Credit in such cases should include the following provision:-

"This amendment shall become effective when it is approved by ADB"

The ADB's approval, if given, will be communicated to your bank's correspondent as well as to the MOVTRI on the form shown in Annexure 4 to this letter.

(H) The expiry date and the shipping date may be extended up to the closing date for withdrawal from the Loan Account without ADB's prior approval. When such extension has been made, MOVTRI should promptly inform ADB of such extension in the form shown in Annexure 3 to this letter attaching one copy of the extension duly signed by an authorized officer of your bank. Two copies of every amendment, whether subject to ADB's prior approval or not, should be sent by your bank to MOVTRI who will arrange, where necessary, for the ADB's approval to be issued.

4. On making payment to the beneficiary in terms of a Letter of Credit in respect of which a letter of commitment has been issued by the ADB, your bank's correspondent should forward the relevant documents to your bank and request reimbursement from ADB in the form shown in Annexure 5 to this letter. Your bank's correspondent should also forward a copy of the request for reimbursement to MOVTRI. In order to facilitate prompt disbursement, your bank's correspondent may send an authenticated SWIFT, telex or cable request to the ADB in the form shown in Annexure 6 to this letter. Arrangements should be made with the correspondent to advise your bank as expeditiously as possible about the receipt of reimbursement from ADB, and the shipping documents should be retained until confirmation of such reimbursement has been received. No Counterpart Funds are to be collected from the MOVTRI at the time of releasing the documents.

5. In case there is any discrepancy between the shipping documents and the terms of a Letter of Credit, the ADB will not be in a position to honour the payment claim. Neither will it be in a position to accept a Letter of Indemnity issued or endorsed by (Negotiating) commercial bank. In such an event, the negotiating commercial bank should seek through your bank the MOVTRI's authorization to make such payment despite any discrepancy.

The MOVTRI after authorizing the payment in consultation with your bank, should inform ADB by cable of the discrepancy and of the payment authorization given to the negotiating bank.

6. Where a commitment is issued by ADB in a currency other than the US Dollar, the commitment letter will specify the US Dollar equivalent determined on the basis of the exchange rate at which the ADB expects the non-US currency to become available for payment under such commitment. If in the case of any particular claim made by any of your bank's correspondents in a non-US Currency, the US Dollar equivalent exceeds the amount available under ADB's commitment, ADB will limit the reimbursement to the non-US Currency equivalent of such US Dollar amount available. If for this reason or for any other reason whatso­ever, ADB declines to reimburse your bank's correspondent in full or in part in respect of a claim made in terms of your Letter of Credit, your bank may remit to your bank's correspondent the amount disallowed by the ADB. You should make necessary arrangements for this purpose with MOVTRI.

7. The Controller of Exchange will advise your bank regarding Exchange Control requirements connection.

8. All your bank's charges should be for account of MOVTRI.

RECOVERY OF ACCOMMODATION TO EXPORTERS

As discussed at the Bank Managers' meetings of 22nd December 2000 and 18th January 2001 and the meeting of Sri Lanka Forex Dealers' Association on 24th November 2000, it has been agreed that the delays in the settlement of accommodation granted by licensed commercial banks for financing export orders, can cause problems for the prudential management of the banks and that there is a need to adopt a uniform practice in this regard by all the banks.

2. Therefore, with a view to securing the early settlement of financial accommodation granted to exporters on the basis of export orders, licensed commercial banks are required to observe the following procedures with effect from 23 January 2001.

(a) Licensed commercial banks should make every endeavour to ensure the repatriation of export proceeds in time against export orders made through them.

(b) In doing so, licensed commercial banks should ensure that their borrowers settle in full the accommodation granted to finance export orders out of export proceeds within a period of 90 days from the date of shipment of goods in respect of which the accommodation has been granted.

(c) In order to achieve the above objectives, the rate of interest applicable on such accommodation, where the borrower does not repay export proceeds in time, shall be enhanced as follows:

(i) 1,000 basis points per annum, where there is a delay of not more than 30 days beyond the 90 days from the date of shipment; and

(ii) an additional 200 basis points per annum for every 30 days delay thereafter.

3. Licensed commercial banks are hereby requested to submit monthly reports to the Director of Bank Supervision (DBS) on the details of such accommodation which has not been settled within the specified period in the format given in the Annexure.

4. Each monthly report should be submitted to DBS on or before the end of the second week of the subsequent month. Accordingly, the first report providing the aforementioned details in respect of January 2001 should reach DBS on or before 16th February 2001.

RECOVERY OF ACCOMMODATION TO EXPORTERS

At the meeting of Bank Managers held on 26 January 2001 the Bank Managers sought clarifications with regard to the contents of the Circular No. 01/01/002/0034/001 of 22nd January 2001 on the above subject. The agreements reached at the meeting are set out below.

(A) Settlement of Export Credit out of Export proceeds

The Bank Managers raised the issue as to whether in all instances export credit should be settled out of proceeds of the relevant exports. It is agreed that export credit (including overdraft granted for export purposes) is granted on the basis that repayment would be made out of export proceeds and that, therefore, the enhanced interest rates specified in the circular would apply where there is failure to settle the export credit out of export proceeds within 90 days of the shipment of goods under the export order.

(B) Applicability of the Circular to Off-shore Banking Units

The Bank Managers also raised the issue as to whether the requirements of the circular would apply to off-shore banking units as well. It was agreed that the rationale underlying the requirements of the circular would apply equally to credit granted by both domestic units and off-shore units of banks which are part of a single licensed commercial bank and that, therefore, its requirements would apply to settlement of export credit granted by both such units.

(C) Applicability of the Circular to Overdrafts

The Bank Managers raised the question of the settlement of overdrafts out of export proceeds. It was agreed that the overdraft facilities granted for export purposes should be settled out of export proceeds within 90 days of the shipment of goods and the failure to do so would attract the enhanced interest rates specified in the circular.

Licensed commercial banks are required to abide by the agreements reached at the Bank Managers' meeting.

Instructions to Licensed Commercial Banks Appointed as Authorized Dealers in Foreign Exchange

January 29, 2001

Dear Sirs,

FORWARD SALES AND PURCHASES OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE

The Central Bank is concerned that in view of the weaknesses of the forward market in foreign exchange in Sri Lanka, licensed commercial banks that are Authorised Dealers under the Exchange Control Act (Authorised Dealers) could be undertaking heavy risks by engaging in forward transactions in foreign exchange which are unrelated to trade transactions, which would be detrimental to the interests of the depositors of such banks and to the economy. Therefore, in the interest of the depositors and to stabilise the foreign exchange market, it is considered necessary to streamline the operations in the forward market in foreign exchange, pending the development of an efficient forward market. Hence, both from a prudential standpoint and from considerations relating to the stability of the foreign exchange market, it is desirable that forward foreign exchange contracts by banks with their customers should, for the time being, be in respect of transactions concerning payments and receipts in foreign exchange relating to trade in goods and services and for a period reasonably adequate to meet the needs of trade transactions.

2. In view of the foregoing, Authorised Dealers are hereby informed that the authority conferred on them to enter into forward contracts for the sale and/or purchase of foreign exchange for a period up to 360 days irrespective of the purpose by paragraph B(ii)(a) of Operating Instructions No.EC/41/93(D) of 29.03.1993 issued by the Controller of Exchange is hereby withdrawn with immediate effect.

3. Therefore, without prejudice to the permission granted to Authorised Dealers for the release of foreign exchange for all current (non-capital) international transactions by Operating Instructions No.EC/06/94 of 18.03.1994 of the Controller of Exchange, and pending the development of an efficient forward market in foreign exchange in Sri Lanka, Authorised Dealers shall, with immediate effect, comply with the following conditions when entering into forward contracts in foreign exchange (including renewal of existing contracts) with their customers, until further notice;

(i) forward contracts for the sale and/or purchase of foreign exchange should only be for a period up to 180 days and only for the purpose of payments and receipts in foreign exchange in respect of trade in goods and services;

(ii) an Authorised Dealer entering into a forward foreign exchange contract should satisfy himself that the transaction relates to a genuine commercial contract involving trade in goods and services;

(Hi) an Authorised Dealer who enters into a forward contract for the sale of foreign exchange with a customer should obtain at the time the contract is entered into, a deposit of not less than 50% of the value of the contract in Sri Lanka rupees, which should be retained until the date of performance of the contract;

(iv) the date of performance of the forward foreign exchange contract should not be beyond the date of payment or receipt in foreign exchange, as the case may be, in terms of the relevant commercial contract underlying the forward exchange contract; and

(v) as at present, any cancellation of a forward foreign exchange contract by the customer should be subject to a penalty, at least to fully compensate the loss arising therefrom to the Authorised Dealer.

4. Details relating to forward transactions in foreign exchange on any day should be reported at the end of the same day (not later than 6.00 p.m.) to the Director of Bank Supervision on fax No.325824 in the form set out in the Annex hereto. Please contact Mr. P. Samarasiri, Deputy Director of Bank Supervision on telephone number 344838 for any clarification.

PREPAYMENT OF IMPORT BILLS

You would recall the discussion at the Bank Managers' meeting held on 26 January 2001 with regard to the pre-payment of import bills. The Bank Managers in particular mentioned that importers who had imported goods on deferred payment terms have recently resorted to the practice of settling the relevant import bills prior to the date on which payment of the bills is due. It was agreed that this practice could cause difficulties to banks and also result in instability in the foreign exchange market. It was, therefore, decided that pre­payment of import bills should not be undertaken by banks.

The licensed commercial banks who are authorized dealers are, therefore, informed that they should not effect pre-payment of import bills and that such bills should be honoured on the date of maturity as agreed to in the contract entered into with the supplier at the time of placing the import order.

Yours faithfully

Controller of Exchange Director of Bank Supervision

Dear Sir / Madam,

DEFINITION OF LIQUID ASSETS - UNDER SECTION 86 OF THE BANKING ACT No. 30 OF 1988

In exercise of the powers conferred by Item (g) of the definition of "liquid assets" in Section 86 of the Banking Act, No. 30 of 1988, the Monetary Board has determined that 50% of the investments in Commercial Paper/Promissory Notes, which are backed by an approved standby credit line from a Licensed Commercial Bank/Licensed Specialised Bank supporting the issue to the full redemption value or an investment grade rating by a Rating Agency approved by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, and has a remaining maturity of less than 1 year be considered as liquid assets.

Kindly acknowledge receipt of this letter.

Yours faithfully

Ref. No.: 02 / 04 / 004 / 0009 / 001

We have received inquiries from banks seeking clarifications on the contents of our Operating Instructions dated 29th January 2001, on the above subject. Accordingly, the following clarifications are made for your information.

1. The Operating Instructions will not apply to

(i) Inter-bank forward contracts (local and foreign),

(ii) Forward contracts where a foreign currency is purchased with another foreign currency,

(Hi) Purchases of foreign exchange in respect of share trading transactions specified in the item 3 in the Operating Instructions No. EC/74/92(C&F) dated 28/07/1992 issued by the Controller of Exchange.

2. Subject to l(iu') above, forward contracts with customers should be permitted only in respect of trade in goods and services. Forward contracts in respect of capital transactions should not be permitted.

3. In the case of renewal or extension of a contract, the maximum period of forward contract should be 180 days inclusive of the period that has already elapsed. In cases where the period exceeds 180 days, a fresh contract should be entered into which requires a 50 per cent of deposit in case of a forward contract for the sale of foreign exchange.

4. In case of an importer, the margin already obtained in respect of Letters of Credit, if any, should not be treated as the deposit required for a forward contract for the sale of foreign exchange and, therefore, a fresh deposit of 50% of the value of the contract in Sri Lanka rupees is required for the forward contract.

5. The banks may pay interest on the 50% margin as a deposit.

6. The attached format should be used in future to report details regarding daily position of forward transactions to the Bank Supervision Department.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Sirs,

FORWARD SALES AND PURCHASES OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE

Ref. No.: 02 / 05 / 009 / 0100 / 001

RECOVERY OF ACCOMMODATION TO EXPORTERS

I refer to our Circulars 01/01/002/0034/001 dated 22nd January, 2001 and 02/05/009/0100/001 dated 29th January, 2001, in which procedures agreed on the above subject were conveyed by us. Since then, some banks and exporters have requested an extension of the maximum period of 90 days granted from the date of shipment to settle export credit out of export proceeds, without being subjected to enhanced interest rates, on the ground that it is customary for certain exports to be made on 120 days deferred payment terms. They have cited, as an example, tea exports to Russia where, in the normal course of business, a period exceeding 90 days would be necessary for settlement of export credits.

2. Having considered these representations, it has now been decided that licensed commercial banks may use their judgement and discretion to enhance the period granted to settle export credit out of export proceeds up to 120 days from the date of shipment in respect of exports where it is customary to grant 120 days deferred payment terms to buyers. Accordingly, enhanced rates of interest applicable on accommodation in respect of such exports will be as follows.

(0 1,000 basis points per annum, where there is a delay of not more than 30 days beyond the 120 days or lesser period decided by the banks from the date of shipment; and

(ii) an additional 200 basis points per annum for every 30 days delay thereafter.

This will come into effect from Monday 19th February, 2001.

3. The following clarifications on the contents of the two Circulars referred to above are also made for your information.

(i) In the event the agreed payment period of the export bill/order connected with the accommodation exceeds 90 days or the period decided by the banks under the paragraph 2 above, enhanced interest rates would apply for the period beyond 90 days or the period decided by the banks, as the case may be, from the date of shipment.

(ii) Where export credits are not recovered within 90 days or the period decided by banks under the paragraph 2 above, enhanced interest rates would apply to all accommodation granted to such exporters by way of purchasing/discounting bills, pre-shipment/post-shipment credit as well as other loans and overdraft facilities. In the event credit facilities such as overdrafts cannot be identified with a specific export bill/order, such credit facilities may be apportioned among export bills/orders of the customer concerned for the purpose of applying enhanced interest rates.

(Hi) Enhanced interest rates would apply to export credit facilities in rupees as well as in foreign currencies granted by both Domestic Banking Units and Foreign Currency Banking Units.

(iv) Enhanced interest rates would not apply to credit facilities granted against export bills negotiated prior to 22nd January, 2001. However, enhanced interest rates would apply to such credit facilities if they are not recovered out of export proceeds within the agreed payment period of the export bill/order.

Dear Sir,

PUBLICATION OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY

STATEMENT IN THE ANNUAL REPORT

You may be aware that the CBSL guidelines permit consolidation of subsidiaries for the purpose of computing capital adequacy ratios of banks but have not specified the nature of subsidiaries to be consolidated. The CBSL is presently reviewing the policy on consolidation of subsidiaries by banks for capital adequacy purposes.

It is observed that there had been no uniformity among banks in presenting the capital adequacy statement in their Annual Reports. While few banks publish the statement on a 'solo' basis others present it on a 'consolidated' basis.

With a view to giving a true picture to the readers, it is recommended that the basis of computation of the capital adequacy and the inclusion of non banking and non-financial subsidiaries in the computation of the capital adequacy ratio, be disclosed as a footnote to the capital adequacy statement, if published in the Annual Report of the bank.

Yours faithfully

P.T. Sirisena

RECOVERY OF ACCOMMODATION TO EXPORTERS

We refer to our circulars 01/01/002/0034/001 dated 22nd January, 2001 and 02/05/009/0100/001 dated 29th January, 2001 and 16th February, 2001 on the above subject.

Some licensed commercial banks have sought further clarifications on the contents of the above circulars. Accordingly, we furnish the following clarifications;

1. Circulars will apply to credit granted to finance all types of export orders irrespective of the terms of payments which can be on sight, on deferred payment terms supported with letters of credit or other terms inclusive of bills on collection or on consignment basis. All such export credit should be recovered only out of export proceeds, and enhanced rates of interest should apply, if there is any delay in recovery of credit beyond the periods specified in the previous circulars.

2. There may be instances where export credit requested may not be identified with a particular export order with specific terms of payments. Also, some customers may negotiate for credit to finance imports of raw materials or other needs which are directly connected with export business, although it may be difficult to identify such credit with specific export orders. In such cases, banks are requested to apportion such credit among export orders or shipments of the particular exporter and enhanced rates of interest should apply if there is any delay in recovery of the apportioned credit beyond the periods specified in the previous circulars.

3. Certain instances have also been reported where some customers repay their export credit out of rupee funds on the grounds that export proceeds are brought and kept in their foreign currency accounts with banks. However, this would not conform to the method of recovery of export credit stipulated in our circulars. Banks are requested to recover export credit only out of export proceeds, which should be surrendered to banks in sufficient amounts to settle in full the export credit.

All banks are requested to refer queries, if any, to Director, Bank Supervision Department, for any further clarifications on the contents of these circulars.

Instructions to Licensed Commercial Banks

Appointed as Authorized Dealers in Foreign Exchange

Dear Sirs,

FORWARD SALES AND PURCHASES OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE

Further to our Operating Instructions dated 29.01.2001 and 19.03.2001 and the clarifications contained in our Operating Instructions dated 14.02.2001 on the above subject.

The requirement that a margin of not less than 25 per cent should be obtained from customers when entering into a forward contract for the sale of foreign exchange is withdrawn, with effect from 16th July, 2001.

However, for prudential reasons, banks may continue to obtain deposits from customers for forward sales of foreign exchange, based on their assessment of customer risk.

Contracts for forward sales and/or purchases will continue to be for a maximum of 180 days and only for the purpose of payments and receipts in foreign exchange in respect of trade in goods and services.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,

PUBLIC DISCLOSURE BY PUBLICATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE PRESS

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) in keeping with international banking standards for greater transparency and market discipline has decided to introduce certain disclosure requirements. These are aimed at improving the market's ability to make well-informed decisions as a means of promoting a sound and efficient banking system in Sri Lanka.

Accordingly, we enclose herewith the format prepared for publishing the financial statements in the Press as agreed with the Chief Executive Officers of Licensed Specialised Banks' (LSBs) Meeting.

All LSBs are hereby informed that the annual and half-yearly financial statements should be published in the Press as per the enclosed formats commencing from the half-yearly accounts as at 30 June 2001. Banks whose financial year end is 31 March should commence publishing with the half-yearly accounts as at 30 September 2001. Publication of financial statements in the Press should be made within three months of the close of the half-year and six months of the close of the financial year.

Further, the enclosed formats specify the minimum information required to be disclosed, and the CBSL would welcome any additional voluntary disclosures by banks.

With regard to the medium of publication, LSBs may initially publish the financial statements in the daily English Newspapers. However, if any LSB wishes to publish financial statements in Sinhala or Tamil it may do so to suit the bank's requirements.

Please acknowledge receipt of this letter.

Dear Sirs,

PREPAYMENT OF IMPORT BILLS

We refer to our circular dated 29th January 2001 on the above subject, in terms of which licensed commercial banks who are Authorized Dealers were informed that they should not effect pre-payment of import bills and that such bills should be honoured on the date of maturity as agreed to in the contract entered into with the supplier at the time of placing the import order.

Commercial banks who are Authorized Dealers are hereby informed that this requirement is withdrawn with effect from Monday, 20th August 2001. However, a commercial bank/Authorized Dealer may use his discretion for prudential reasons to reject any prepayment of an import bill, without referring to us.

Dear Sir,

PUBLIC DISCLOSURE BY PUBLICATION OF BANK ACCOUNTS IN THE PRESS

Your attention is drawn to our circular No.BS/62/97 dated 29.01.1999 on the above subject.

If the audited accounts of banks are published in the newspapers stating that they are audited without any reference to any audit qualifications, where there are such qualifications, it could mislead the public. Therefore, banks should include a brief description of any audit qualifications when they publish the audited accounts in the newspapers.

Further, I wish to inform you that banks are expected to publish their annual audited accounts in newspapers within six months of the end of their financial year and their half yearly un-audited accounts within three months of the end of the half-year.

GUIDELINES ON CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE -'KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER' PROCEDURES

In order to prevent the unchecked use of the financial system for money laundering and transactions related to terrorism and subversive activities, it is recommended that all banks follow these guidelines on customer identification at the time of opening an account for a prospective customer, or before establishing a business relationship with a prospective customer, or thereafter when there is a material change in the way an account is operated. In addition to minimising the risk of use of the banking system for illicit activities, the adoption of these guidelines will provide protection against possible frauds, and enable the timely recognition of suspicious transactions and protect the bank from reputational, legal and financial risks.

1. All banks are encouraged to document their policies on customer acceptance, customer identification/risk management and monitoring of high risk accounts.

2. In order to 'know their customers' the banks are expected to:

(i) Have sufficient information on the identity of the customer.

(ii) Be satisfied that a prospective customer is who he/she claims to be. If the customer is acting on behalf of another, sufficient evidence on the identity of both parties should be obtained.

(Hi) Ensure that information obtained in respect of a customer in the normal course of business is used effectively for the prevention of money laundering/terrorism funding.

3. Customer Identification

3.1 Personal Accounts

The following information should be obtained from all prospective personal customers:

• Customer's name from an original of a document issued by an official authority, preferably bearing a photograph of the customer, such as the national identity card, passport or the driving license. The reference number of such document should be recorded by the bank.

• Customer's permanent mailing address and supporting evidence which should be confirmed through correspondence.

• The authenticity and integrity of an introducer and his own identity should be established to the satisfaction of the bank.

• Independent verification of introducer's address should be made and filed with the mandate.

3.2 Corporate Customers

The following documents should be obtained:

• Certificate of Incorporation, Memorandum and Articles of Association or Partnership Agreement, as appropriate, to establish the legal status of the customer • Resolution by the Board of Directors

(xlviii)

• Duly completed application form containing authorised specimen signatures

• The identity of each director and those authorised to operate the account, should be established.

• For companies, businesses or partnerships registered outside Sri Lanka, similar documents should be obtained, taking into consideration any soft regulatory system in the country of origin.

3.3 In the case of accounts operated by:

• A Power of Attorney

• Joint account holders

• Partnerships

• Trust accounts/Fiduciary accounts

The identity should be established in respect of each signatory to the account.

3.4 More stringent customer identification policies should be established in the following circumstances:

• Accounts opened by post or in any other circumstances where there is no face to face contact with the customer.

• In the case of one-off transactions for non-account holders of the bank, in particular where such transactions involve large amounts of cash, or the receipt of unusually large foreign remittances, the customer should be asked to produce documentary evidence of identity, and copies of such documents should be retained by the bank.

• Where safe custody facilities are made available to non-account holders, identification procedure for non-account holders, as above, should be followed.

• In accommodating requests for remittances of funds between accounts using electronic payment systems, where such transactions are of a large size, the bank should establish the identity of the sender and ascertain the identity of the recipient.

4. In instances where the bank cannot establish the true identity of the customer to its satisfaction, it should not commence any business relationship with such customer.

5. Other Recommendations

5.1 In respect of all types of accounts, returned letters and statements should be followed-up.

5.2 Where after opening an account, the features of the transactions, as known at the time of opening of the account changes significantly, causing grounds for suspicion of criminal activity, inquiries should be made with regard to the changes in the financial position and nature of activities, which should be recorded.

5.3 Retention of records: All evidence of identification as set out above should be maintained for a minimum period of five (05) years even after an account is closed.

5.4 Where the officer handling the account opening has reasons to believe that a new relationship may expose the bank to significant reputational risk, he may refer such request to an officer of higher authority before opening the account.

5.5 The internal controller/auditor may be required to ensure compliance with the bank's policies on customer acceptance and identification.

(Hi)

Ref. No. : 06 / 04 / 057 / 0001 / 003

In the Budget Speech of 8 March, 2001 it was announced that the facility for Parliamentarians, Provincial Councillors, Heads of Local Authorities, public servants and others to import motor vehicles on concessionary duty or on duty free terms was suspended with immediate effect, except in cases where letters of credit have already been established for such imports. Therefore, Authorized Dealers are cautioned to take account of this when establishing letters of credit for the import of motor vehicles.

It has also been brought to my notice that some banks have opened letters of credit after the announcement of the above suspension in the Budget Speech, i.e. around 5.30 p.m. on 8 March, 2001 by indicating a prior date or time. This is an irregular and fraudulent practice designed to circumvent the suspension announced in the Budget Speech, and Authorised Dealers will be liable for any loss of government revenue arising therefrom and for any penalties under the Exchange Control Act.

Please bring this to the notice of your employees.
