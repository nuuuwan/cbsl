    "text": "The measures presented in the Budget 2001 were expected to consolidate fiscal operations after the significant slippage in 2000. They were designed to bring the budgetary outturn back to the medium term fiscal consolidation path as the persistently high budget deficit was not sustainable. These measures, aimed at reducing the budget deficit, while targetting- higher public investment, sought to create an environment conducive to higher private sector investment. The higher public investment was to be funded mainly from external sources. The stabilisation measures were expected to reduce consumption expenditure of the government, increase revenue and reduce borrowing from the domestic market. These measures were expected to contain the overall deficit in 2001 to 8.5 per cent of GDP, from a deficit of 11.4 per cent of GDP that would have resulted had there been no changes to the existing fiscal policies. The deficit was targetted to be 1.4 percentage points below the deficit of 9.9 per cent in 2000. In line with this, the current account deficit, which indicates the level of government dis-savings, and the primary deficit, which reflects the impact of the current fiscal policy stance, were to be reduced to 1.2 per cent of GDP and 2.2 per cent, respectively. Meanwhile, public investment was to be increased to 7.4 per cent of GDP with special emphasis on achieving balanced regional development in the economy. The fiscal policy strategy formulated in Budget 2001 aimed at reducing the excessive expansionary pressure exerted by the government on the economy. In line with this stabilisation process, Budget 2001 announced a medium-term fiscal policy strategy, which envisaged a gradual improvement in the fiscal consolidation process. This was to be achieved by increasing the revenue performance and reducing consumption expenditure of the government, while increasing public investment. Accordingly, the overall deficit was expected to be reduced to 5.5 per cent of GDP by 2003 and to 3 per cent of GDP by 2010. Public investment was expected to be increased to 8.5 per cent of GDP by 2003. Consolidation in the fiscal sector was expected to improve macroeconomic stability and reduce interest rates and inflation.",

    "text": "deficit rose to 4.9 per cent. The deterioration in the fiscal sector was attributable to three main developments in 2001. First, the contraction of economic activity due to the slowing down of the world economy, which was further aggravated by domestic problems such as the prolonged drought and the escalation of the on-going conflict, as well as lower imports, adversely affected the achievement of revenue and privatisation targets, reducing government receipts in 2001 by about Rs.43.8 billion. Second, the poor performance in economic activity, the rising cost of living and the political uncertainty compelled the government to offer a special fiscal stimulus package to extend relief to investors as well as to vulnerable groups in society. Special tax incentives granted to investors under this package included the abolition of import duties on essential raw materials, the reduction of import duty on cement, the withdrawal of turnover taxes on the financial transactions of banks, the increase in the duty rebate on imports, the reduction of the NSL rate from 7.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent, and the reduction of stamp duty on imports from 2 per cent to 1 per cent. As a means of extending relief to employees in the public sector, pensioners and people in middle and lower income categories, special fiscal incentives were granted under the package. These were the payment of an interim allowance to public sector employees, an increase in pensions, the abolition of the Save the Nation Contribution (SNC), abolition of the motor vehicle diesel tax and a guarantee to prevent an increase in the price of wheat flour and LP gas. The total cost of the package was estimated at about Rs.9 billion in 2001 (a reduction of income by Rs.5.4 billion and an increase in expenditure by Rs.3.7 billion), equivalent to 0.6 per cent of GDP. Finally, non-implementation of the fiscal adjustments announced in the Budget, brought about a deviation in the fiscal outcome from the original targets. Some of the major adjustments announced in the Budget such as better targetting of the Samurdhi programme, strict cadre management, strict limits on expenditure relating to parliamentarians and other officials in the public sector, freezing of permits pertaining to the purchase of new vehicles and other non-priority capital purchases by ministries and public institutions, and the adjustment of prices of goods and services provided by public entities to reflect their true cost, were not effectively implemented. In addition to these main reasons, expenses which were not expected at the time of the preparation of the Budget (such as the cost of the general election, the budgetary burden of the prolonged drought etc.) resulted in increasing expenditure and consequently causing a significant deviation of the actual fiscal outcome from the original targets.",

The appointment of 53 ministers and 7 deputy ministers (in addition there are 40 ministers in the provincial councils (PCs)) goes against the proposed fiscal consolidation process, as a large number of ministries (57) would necessarily place an additional burden on government expenditure. The introduction of a small but well structured ministerial structure, consistent with the structures of other sub-national governments (PCs and Local Government (LGs)) is required to contain expenditure, as well as for the smooth functioning of the fiscal system.

    "text": "In relation to the general government operations in the country, the present power sharing system of the central government with other sub-national governments (PCs and LGs) is concentrated around the central government making PCs and LGs highly dependent on the centre. From the inception of these sub-national government units, a system of 'gap filling' has operated, where funds required to bridge the deficit of the sub-national government have been transferred from the central government. This has been mainly because, in the current structure, although greater autonomy has been given to these sub-national institutions for resource allocation, their resource mobilisation efforts have been restricted. As the current gap filling approach is highly inefficient, the entire devolution system should be restructured to extend more independence to individual systems while maintaining inter-dependency within the entire general government system. This would be a forward-looking step and a positive action, consistent with the current on-going peace process.",

The primary deficit rose by about 2 percentage points of GDP from the budgetary target to 4.1 per cent of GDP. The effects of fiscal operations in 2001 were the same as in 2000; the sharp increase in interest payments led to the increase in the overall deficit. Meanwhile, the current account deficit increased to 4.9 per cent of GDP from the expected target of 1.2 per cent and last year's deficit of 3.4 per cent.

This contributed to increasing the debt stock in public corporations in 2001, emphasising the need for introducing an automatic price adjustment mechanism for goods and services provided by these institutions, which are linked to the cost of production, so that the commercial viability of these enterprises can be improved and the overall burden of the public sector on the economy lowered.",

Despite all these efforts, total revenue was 1.8 percentage points below the budgeted target of 18.3 per cent of GDP in 2001. In comparison to 2000, the tax/GDP ratio rose marginally. However, this was offset by a decline in non tax revenue collection. Hence, total revenue as a percentage of GDP declined to 16.5 per cent from 16.8 per cent in 2000. The fall in revenue in 2001 was largely attributable to the contraction of economic activity and lower imports. In addition, the fiscal incentive package granted towards the end of year to stimulate the economy also reduced revenue collection in 2001. The revenue foregone due to the fiscal incentive package Was estimated to be about Rs. 5.4 billion in 2001.",

Government expenditure on current operations (21.5 per cent of GDP) was 2 percentage points above the budgeted target and 1.3 percentage points above the previous year's current expenditure. The payment of an interim allowance to public sector employees, an increase in pensions, high expenditure on defence, the inability to contain transfers under the Samurdhi programme, non-implementation of the required price revisions in departmental enterprises such as railways, an increase in fertiliser subsidy payments, an unexpected parliamentary election and drought relief payments were some of the main reasons for the higher current expenditure in 2001. In addition, interest payments on outstanding government overdraft and unpaid import bills with the two state banks (for which provisions were not adequately provided in the Budget), also contributed to the overruns in current expenditure. Greater accuracy in estimating the Budget and improved discipline and accountability in managing public funds would greatly assist in improving the current operations of the Budget.",

Though Budget 2001 envisaged an optimistic investment target of 7.4 per cent of GDP, the realised investment programme was only 5.9 per cent of GDP. The investment rate in 2000 was 6.4 per cent of GDP. As in the past, the slow progress of foreign funded investment programmes was the main reason for this decline. At the same time, limitations in resource availability also restricted the release of funds for locally funded investment programmes, reducing the overall public investment programme further. In addition, delays in the presentation of Budget 2001, an unexpected parliamentary election and changes to the structure of the Cabinet and ministers, were also responsible for this slowdown. Public investment in 2001 was mainly expected in roads, railways, power, ports and water supply sectors. A continuous shortfall in the public investment programme is a matter for serious concern as dilapidated and inadequate infrastructure would adversely affect private sector investment activity in the economy.",

Borrowing from the domestic market, on a net basis, rose by Rs 66 billion to Rs 123 billion (8.8 per cent of GDP). The high borrowing requirement from the domestic sector compelled the government to change the present market based borrowing policy stance to minimise the pressure on the interest rate structure in the domestic market. Accordingly, the Rupee loan programme was extensively used to mobilise resources available with institutional investors, while all new Treasury bills were made as special issues to the Central Bank. The maturity period of new and re-issued Treasury bonds was limited to 2-3 years to avoid locking in funds at high interest rates for a longer period. In addition, the government relied heavily on the two state banks to raise funds directly through bank overdrafts and import bills. As these bank borrowings are entirely outside the normal public debt programme, it reflects a lack of transparency and prudence in debt management in the present system. It is essential to bring such borrowing within the formal debt programme.",

Total borrowing from the banking sector was the net outcome of Rs. 55 billion borrowing from commercial banks and a repayment of Rs.6.4 billion to the Central Bank. In 2001, borrowing from the monetary authority declined entirely due to the reduction in the Central Bank's holding of Treasury bonds in the reverse repo market with the improvement in the liquidity in the market towards the end of the year. Therefore, the expansionary impact of high borrowing from the banking system in 2001 was lower than it was in 2000 due to the repayment to the monetary authority. The effect of large government borrowings from commercial banks was not fully reflected in the interest rates in the domestic market mainly due to two reasons. One reason was that a large share of bank borrowing was from the foreign furrency banking Units (FCBUs). The second reason was the lower private sector demand for credit from the banking system that reduced the overall demand for funds from the banking system.",

The imposition of a 20 per cent surcharge on corporate income taxes and the collection of tax arrears from some public enterprises accounted for the improved performance in corporate taxes, while the upward revision to the NSL rate as well as high growth in certain key sectors liable to NSL despite the slowdown in the economy, were the main reasons for the favourable performance in NSL in 2001.

Even with lower imports in 2001, revenue collection from NSL on imports grew by 26 per cent in 2001. This growth was the result mainly of the upward revision in the tax rate and the relatively few imports exempted from NSL. However, the downward revision in the NSL rate back to 6.5 per cent in October partly offset revenue gains from this source. The revenue loss to the government in the last quarter of 2001, as a result of this reduction in the NSL rate, was estimated at Rs.3 billion.",

The main factors behind this decline were the shortfall in excise duty collection from cigarette sales and liquor production. Excise duty collection from cigarettes sales fell below the targetted level by Rs. 1.6 billion mainly as a result of a decline in sales by 2.5 per cent in 2001 over the previous year. The continuous increase in excise taxes has raised the price of legal brands whilst making illegal brands more attractive to the consumer, resulting in a rapid growth in the illegal cigarette industry. This has posed a serious threat to the legal cigarette industry and has adversely impacted government revenue collection, indicating the need for corrective measures. The liquor industry is facing a similar threat from the illegal liquor industry. Although hard liquor production was maintained at",

Excluding the surcharge (Rs. 5.4 billion), revenue from import duties declined by 14 per cent in 2001, reflecting the negative growth in dutiable imports by 13 per cent. In addition, the removal of import duties on around 1000 essential raw materials in October 2001 significantly reduced import duty collection.

The shortfall in non tax revenue was mainly due to lower profit transfers from the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) by Rs. 1.8 billion and a rescheduling of interest payments due from the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) (Rs. 1.5 billion). The original budget expected to raise Rs. 7.5 billion from interest income on loans given to public enterprises. However only Rs. 6 billion was realised during the year. Due to the adverse conditions faced by the CEB during the year, a rescheduling of interest payments was granted. Profits and dividend transfers, other than profit transfers from the Central Bank, fell short by nearly Rs. 1 billion from the budgeted target of Rs. 4.5 billion. This was mainly on account of the lower profits earned by SLPA as a consequence of the slowdown in port activity following the higher insurance premia charged from ships berthing at the Colombo Port after the terrorist attacks on the Katunayake Airport. A decline in rent income (Rs. 0.4 billion) as a result of lower rent payments from Regional Plantation Companies and a shortfall in revenue from the National Lotteries Board (Rs. 0.7 billion) as a result of the non-implementation of some new revenue generating programmes that were envisaged during the preparation of the Budget, contributed to lowering the revenue from hon tax sources during the year. In comparison to 2000, Central Bank profit transfers increased by Rs.1.8 billion to Rs. 5 billion in 2001. However, this included ah advance payment for 2002 of Rs.l billion.",

Meanwhile, public investment fell short of the target by 1.5 percentage points and was 5.9 per cent of GDP, due to the slow implementation of foreign funded projects and strict controls on rupee funded capital investment.

The cost of the interim allowance granted in 2001 has been estimated at Rs.2.9 billion. In GDP terms, the wage bill increased marginally by 0.1 per cent to 5.6 per cent in 2001, while its share in total current expenditure fell from 27 per cent in 2000 to 26 per cent in 2001.

Interest on domestic debt amounted to Rs.84.6 billion. The rising domestic debt stock and the high interest rates that prevailed in the market during the latter part of 2000 and the first half of 2001, contributed to these higher interest payments in 2001. However, the overrun in actual interest payments over the budgetary allocation was mainly because the budget did not make adequate provision for interest payments on overdraft facilities and outstanding import bills. Interest payments on these instruments amounted to Rs.6.1 billion in 2001, mainly due to the sharp increase in the overdraft facility (the outstanding overdraft of the government increased from Rs.19 billion at end 2000 to Rs.38 billion at end 2001) and the high outstanding balance on import bills (Rs.14.9 billion).",

The large increase in the stock of outstanding Treasury bonds by 95 per cent, from Rs.104 billion in 1999 to Rs.204 billion in 2000 was the main reason for the higher interest payments in 2001. The lower coupon rates that were offered in 2000 and 2001 however, had a mitigating effect on interest costs in 2001. However, this resulted in a cash shortfall, which will be reflected in the interest payments at the time of maturity of these bonds, increasing the interest cost to the budget in the future.",

Expenditure on pension payments rose considerably in 2001, mainly on account of the increase in pensions granted during the second half of 2000 (Rs.500 per month) and a further increase (Rs.750 per month) granted in October 2001. The additional cost of the pension increase granted in 2001 has been estimated at Rs.0.8 billion. The increasing number of retirees (there were 16,750 new pensioners in 2001) has also added to the pension liability of the government. The rapidly ageing population will have a significant impact on future pension payments by the government.

Contrary to expectations, actual expenditure on the Samurdhi programme increased to Rs.12.6 billion in 2001 from Rs.9.7 billion in 2000, because of the lack of commitment to achieving these targets. The reduction in the number of Samurdhi beneficiaries by 45,890 in 2001, was not sufficient to counter the impact of the increase in allowances granted to Samurdhi beneficiaries during the second half of 2000. Data from the Consumer Finances and Socio Economic Survey 1996/97 indicate that approximately 1 million families live on less than Rs.860 per capita per month. (The lower poverty line is defined as the cost per capita of a minimum food and non-food consumption bundle and is estimated to be Rs.860). However, about 2 million families currently receive assistance under the Samurdhi Relief Programme, indicating that there is considerable amount of mis-targetting. In order to improve the effectiveness of this programme, as well as to reduce the burden on the budget, it is imperative that a better targetting mechanism is introduced.",

    "text": "Expenditure on the acquisition and maintenance of capital assets by the central government remained at 2.6 per cent of GDP 2001. These funds were mainly utilised for the improvement of infrastructure facilities directly under the control of the ministries and departments of the central government. Capital transfers declined significantly in 2001 to 2.3 per cent of GDP from 2.8 per cent in 2000. This was due to the lower budgetary transfers to public corporations (from 1 per cent of GDP in 2000 to 0.5 per cent in 2001) and provincial councils (from 0.7 per cent of GDP in 2000 to 0.4 per cent in 2001), mainly as a consequence of the resource constraints faced by the central government, and lower utilisation of foreign funds. The main public corporations that received lower capital transfers in 2001 were the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB), the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). Capital transfers to public institutions improved marginally, mainly due to higher transfers to the Road Development Authority (RDA) on account of several large highway projects, such as the second stage of the Baseline Improvement Project, the Ratnapura-Balangoda section of the Ratnapura-Bandarawela Road Rehabilitation Project and the Colombo-Katunayake expressway, that were under construction during the year.",

    "text": "Foreign funds that were provided to commercially oriented public enterprises through on-lending programmes, remained at the same level as in the previous year of 1 per cent of GDP, but fell short of the budgetary target of 1.6 per cent of GDP. CEB, which was to account for almost fifty per cent of the on-lent funds, was able to utilise more than 87 per cent of its allocated funds. The major power projects under construction during the year were the Kukule hydropower project and the Kelanitissa combined cycle power plant. However, lower utilisation of funds by Sri Lanka Telecom, Sri Lanka Ports Authority, CPC and the Regional Plantation companies led to a decline in the overall on-lending programme in 2001. The low utilisation rate of foreign funds is a cause for concern, as these foreign funds are mainly utilised for infrastructure development projects, which are necessary to create an environment that is conducive for enhanced private sector investment. The slow implementation of projects due to various administrative delays and the lack of coordination between the different agencies involved in implementing projects would need to be speedily resolved, if the public investment programme is to be put back on track.",

The activities devolved to PCs were conducted using resources mainly obtained from two sources, i.e. PCs' own revenue and transfers received from the central government. As the revenue of PCs was much lower than their expenditure, the central government continued to transfer funds to PCs mainly by way of block grants, criteria based grants and matching grants. Province Specific Development Grants (PSDG), which were introduced in 2000, were also provided to PCs in order to implement regional development programmes identified by PCs. In 2001, the total revenue collection of PCs indicated a significant improvement. The notable decrease in capital expenditure due to the central government's resource constraints was also a significant development. Current expenditure, however, increased considerably mainly due to the increase in salaries and wages.",

Of the total revenue, the devolved revenue of PCs accounted for 75 per cent, while the balance was collected on behalf of the local governments (LGs). The substantial increase in revenue in 2001 was due to a significant growth in the collection of stamp duties. The higher collection came from an increase in high value property transactions, in 2001, particularly in the Western Province. The streamlining of stamp duty collection through commercial banks also contributed to this increase. Revenue from turnover taxes increased by 12 per cent. This increase was the combined outcome of higher turnover in business enterprises (8 per cent nominal growth) and an increase in the number of taxpayers. Revenue from licence fees rose marginally, reflecting the slow growth in the registration of new motor vehicles.",

    "text": "Until recently, governments in many countries throughout the world have directly or indirectly controlled a large part of investments through state enterprises. A government may do so in view of its political ideology, or social welfare concerns arising from the perceived ill effects of the market economy. FAumples are the establishment of state enterprises when there is a need for producing public goods, and when there are natural monopolies arising from large fixed costs. However, there is evidence that in many cases the expansion of the role of public sector enterprises became a hindrance to economic growth. Therefore, many governments began to reform inefficient public enterprises in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Reforming public sector institutions are necessary as an economy is liberalised due to changes in political ideology and when technological development changes production processes eliminating inefficient enterprises and giving rise to the production of new goods and services. As an economic system becomes complex, a government may nol be able to maintain its authority on economic activities. The government has lo allow participation of private individuals in complex economic activities, which will reward the economy wilh enhanced growth and development. Further, the prevalence of moral hazard in institutions adds extra reasons for reforms. The government has to depend on appointed agents to perform designated functions. When there is information asymmetry, agents tend to indulge in activities that arc hazardous lo the contract between the agent and the governmenl in the carrying out of designated functions.",

Administrative prices are often not adjusted fully in response to increases in the cost of production requiring large corrections when the financial situation of public enterprises becomes unsustainable. In addition, this leads to price distortions in the market, misallocation of resources, weak financial position of utility agencies, macroeconomic imbalances of the economy, confusion and uncertainty among the public and policy makers. In most cases, administratively set prices are not sufficient to cover even variable costs of production. As a result, utility enterprises normally report large losses requiring current transfers from the government or excessive reliance on bank loans to finance day to day operations.",

The successful restructuring of commercial activities of public enterprises will also bring benefits by way of promoting innovations through better access to new technology, foreign capital and expertise. It will also reduce opportunities for corruption and political exploitation of public assets. The property rights theory suggests that the changes in ownership from public to private will improve incentives for productive efficiency as rewards are directly related to the performance. The owners pay the price for the bankruptcy, if they do not perform well but in the case of public sector enterprises, inefficiencies call for further subsidies from the government. The restructuring of PEs also promote allocative and productive efficiency of resources in contrast to the public sector monopolies, which arc intrinsically inefficient. The restructuring serves as an important signalling devise in attracting foreign investment and modern technology.",

This was a deviation from the borrowing strategy of the government, which was to mobilise funds at the lowest possible cost while moving towards more market oriented debt instruments. Mobilisation of funds through market oriented long and medium term debt instruments during a period of temporary high interest rates is not an appropriate debt management strategy, as it will exert pressure on market interest rates and raise the interest cost to the government. Therefore, the domestic borrowing programme in 2001, largely relied on non market type borrowing instruments. This type of borrowing strategy was possible because resources came mainly from captive institutional investors. The issuance of Sri Lanka Development Bonds in 2001 also helped ease the pressure on the domestic market.",

In comparison to other government securities with comparable maturity periods, interest rates on Rupee loans were maintained at a low level. During the year Rupee loans were issued with maturity periods of 2-8 years at an interest rate of 13.00-15.00 per cent. The main investors in the Rupee loan programme were the captive investors, led by EPF and NSB, which purchased about 95 per cent of total net issues.",

The interest rate for the first year was 6 month LIBOR plus 1.75 per cent, while the interest rates for the second year was 6 month LIBOR plus 2.25 per cent. A higher rate in the second year was given as an incentive for not exercising the put option. The second issue of US dollars 50 million was made in December 2001 with a maturity period of 2 years. The interest rate was fixed at the 6 month LIBOR plus a 2.00 per cent margin without a put option. In contrast to the expectations of attracting foreign investors, almost the entire investment for SLDBs (Rs. 14.6 billion) came from commercial banks in Sri Lanka.",

When adjusted for defence related debt, net receipts of concessional loans amounted to Rs.9.8 billion, in comparison with the original target of Rs.28.1 billion. The lower level of utilisation of foreign resources has been the major issue in the area of foreign financing. The average utilisation rate of loans extended by the three major creditors (Japan, ADB and IDA) from 1998 to 2001 was only 13 per cent. This was mainly due to administrative and other impediments, such as, delays associated with awarding contracts, loan effectiveness (the period between signing of an agreement and the first disbursements date) and the provision of counterpart funds as well as problems relating to the acquisition of land. Corrective measures are necessary to address these issues in order to raise the present low ratio of aid utilisaton.

Although in absolute terms this was a marginal increase over that in 2000, as a percentage of GDP, this was a continuation of the declining trend observed over the last several years. The increase in Sri Lanka's per capita income and the resultant upgrading of Sri Lanka as a lower middle income country and the general decline in international grants extended to developing countries were the major reasons for this shortfall. The government of Japan, the People's Republic of China and the Netherlands were among the major donors.",
