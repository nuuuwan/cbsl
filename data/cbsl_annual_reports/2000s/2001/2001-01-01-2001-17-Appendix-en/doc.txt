(a) A new series with a wider coverage and with the base year as 1997. tn the former annual trade indices series, the price index was first computed as a Laspeyres index and Source: Central Bank of Sri Lanka the volume index was derived as the ratio between the value index and the price index (effectively as a Paasche index). In order to accommodate the variability of items arising from the greater frequency of a monthly index, the new monthly trade indices series first computes the volume index as a Laspeyres index and then derives a unit value index as the ratio between the value and volume index. This methodology avoids the subjective imputation of prices that would be required in deriving a price index first when certain items are not exported or imported in a particular month.

(a) A new series with a wider coverage and with the base year as 1997. In the former annual trade indices series, the price index was first computed as a Laspeyres index and the volume index was derived as the ratio between the value index and the price index (effectively as a Paasche index). In order to accommodate the variability of items arising from the greater frequency of a monthly index, the new monthly trade indices series first computes the volume index as a Laspeyres index and then derives a unit value index as the ratio between the value and volume index. This methodology avoids the subjective imputation ol prices that would be required in deriving a price index first when certain items are not exported or imported in a particular month. (b) Provisional.

(c) Excluding the value of a generator imported by a private company to the value of US dollars 84 million in 2000. (d) Excluding the value of aircraft imported by Sri Lankan Airlines in 1999 and 2000.

(a) A new series with a wider coverage and with the base year as 1997. In the former annual trade indices series, the price index was first computed as a Laspeyres index and the volume index was derived as the ratio between the value index and the price index (effectively as a Paasche index). In order to accommodate the variability of items arising from the greater frequency of a monthly index, the new monthly trade indices series tirst computes the volume index as a Laspeyres index and then derives a unit value index as the ratio between the value and volume index. This methodology avoids the subjective imputation of prices that would be required in deriving a price index first when certain items are not exported or imported in a particular month. (b) Provisional.

(c) Excluding the value of a generator imported by a private company to the value of US dollars 84 million in 2000.

(d) Excluding the value of aircraft imported by Sri Lankan Airlines in 1999 and 2000.

(a) A new series with wider coverage and with the base year as 1997. In the former annual trade indices series, the price index was first computed as a Laspeyres index and the volume index was derived as the ratio between the value index and the price index (eftectively as a Paasche index). In order to accommodate the variability of items arising from the greater frequency of a monthly index, the new monthly trade indices series first computes the volume index as a Laspeyres index and then derives a unit value index as the ratio between the value and volume index. This methodology avoids the subjective imputation of prices that would be required in deriving a price index first when certain items are not exported or imported in a particular month. (b) Provisional.

(a) t h e figures in the table differ from statistics on external assets published in the Annual Reports and Bulletins up to Dec.1961. the differences that occur are explained more fully in the footnotes that follow. Further, since 1994, Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs) have been treated as a part of the domestic banking system.

(b) Figures upto 1959 include War Loan re-lent to the U.K. Government, less the part held by the Currency Board/Central Bank. Figures upto 1952 agree with previously published statistics. Any difference thereafter is due to the inclusion of balances due to Sri Lanka under payments agreement with the People's Republic of China. Except for these balances, which are recorded according to local records, the basis of valuation throughout is at face value according to records abroad. Figures since 1985 have been revised to include DST's special revolving credit balances.

(c) As previously published i.e. at face value according to records abroad. Includes foreign assets held by the Sterling Loans Sinking Fund up to 1974. (d) The assets of the Currency Board were transferred to the Central Bank on 28 August, 1950. Figures upto 1949 are as previously published. Thereafter the figures are as published under the International Reserve in the balance sheet of the Central Bank. The International Reserve also includes balances due to Sri Lanka on bilateral clearing accounts other than with the People's Republic of China and include statutory reserve requirements of commercial banks since January 1993. (e) All figures are according to local records, and upto 1947 are as previously published. From 1949 they agree with foreign balances of commercial banks. The balances are the sum ol foreign currency on hand and balances due from banks abroad and export bills purchased and discounted. From 1994 onwards Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs) have been treated as a part of the domestic banking system in the compilation of balance of payments statistics. Accordingly, transactions involving FCBUs and non-residents are taken into account in the compilation of balance of payments statistics, while those involving FCBUs and residents are excluded- Since 1993 liquid balances have been re-defined to exclude placements of balances with FCBUs while balances held by FCBUs with non-residents have been included.

(a) From mid-night of 15 November 1977, the Sri Lanka rupee was allowed to float. However, the daily buying and selling rates of major Sources: Central Bank of Sri Lanka currencies for telegraphic transfers by commercial banks were announced by the Central Bank. From 10 November 1982 the Central International Financial Statistics Bank's foreign exchange transactions with commercial banks were carried out exclusively in US dollars and spot buying and selling rates for the dollar for transactions with commercial banks were announced by the Central Bank daily. With effect from 23 January 2001, the Central Bank refrained from announcing these rates and allowed the market forces of supply and demand to determine the market rate.

* 2001 data are provisional.

(a) This new monetary survey is based on the aggregated data pertaining to both Domestic Banking Units (DBUs) and Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs) of banks operating in Sri Lanka.

Definitional changes have been adopted in aggregating DBUs and FCBUs data to avoid double counting and misclassification of assets and liabilities. The major changes are:

(1) All DBU placements in FCBUs are recorded as domestic assets, while all DBU borrowings from FCBUs are recorded as domestic liabilities. (2) Foreign currency deposits of DBUs are classified on the basis of ownership rather than on the basis of currency. Hence, the following apply:

(Contd.)

(i) One half ( 50 per cent) of NRFC deposits are treated as domestic deposit liabilities;

(ii) All RNNFC balances are treated as foreign liabilities:

(iii) All other domestic foreign currency accounts are treated as domestic deposit liabilities.

(b) External assets (net) of the Central Bank and commercial banks (including outward bills).

(c) Currency and demand deposits of the public.

(d) Time and savings deposits of the private sector held with commercial banks.

(a) This financial survey is based on the aggregated data pertaining to Domestic Banking Units (DBUs), Foreign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs), Licenced Specilised Banks (LSBs) and Finance Companies (FINCOs) operating in Sri Lanka. All data are provisional.

Definitional changes have been adopted in aggregating DBU, FCBUs, LSBs and FINCOs data to avoid double counting and misclassification of assets and liabilities. The major changes are:

(1) All DBU placements in FCBUs are recorded as domestic assets, while all DBU borrowings from FCBUs are recorded as domestic liabilities.

(2) Foreign currency deposits of DBUs are classified on the basis of ownership rather than on the basis of currency. Hence, the following apply:

(i) One half (50 per cent) of NRFC deposits are treated as domestic deposit liabilities;

(ii) All RNNFC balances are treated as foreign liabilities;

(iii) All other domestic foreign currency accounts are treated as domestic liabilities.

(b) External assets (net) of the Central Bank, Commercial banks (including outward bills), LSBs and FINCOs .

(c) Currency, demand deposits and quasi-money in DBUs in this table differ from those in Table 112 due to the fact that LSBs and FINCOs are not treated as public under this broad monetary survey (M 4) definition.

(d) Time and savings deposits of the private sector with commercial banks and LSBs and FINCOs .

(e) Credit extended by the banking system, LSBs and FINCOs to the Government, net of Government deposits with banks and Government cash deposits.

Commercial Banks' Rates on Advances

Source: Central Bank of Sri Lanka

(a) Weighted average yield rates prevailing at the end of the period. (b) This is the rate at which the Central Bank grants advances to commercial banks for their temporary liquidity purposes. After August 1977, each bank, depending on its holdings of selected asset items, was allocated a certain quota of the total borrowings permitted at the Bank Rate. Borrowings in excess of this quota were subjected to a penal rate ol interest of 15 per cent per annum. In September 1979, a graduated scale ot penal rates ranging between 15 per cent and 25 per cent was introduced. It was further revised upward lo a range of 20 per cent to 30 per cent, with effect from April 1980. With effect from August 1980, the Bank Rate was raised to 14 per cent, while the penal rate was raised to a range 21-30 per cent In March 1983, the Bank Rate was brought down to 13 per cent and the penal rate was fixed at 20 per cent. With effect from 23 November 1983, the practice of granting advances to commercial banks under a penal rate was discontinued. With effect from 30 December 1985, the Central Bank reduced the lending rate on its advances to 11 per cent. A turther reduction, to 10 per cent, was made with effect from 07 August 1987. The Central Bank increased the lending rate on advances to 14 per cent with effect from 15 June 1989. The rate was increased again to 15 per cent, with effect Irom 06 July 1990 and to 17 per cent with effect from 04 January 1991. This rate was brought down to 16 per cent with effect Irom 13 August 1999. This rate was increased to 18 per cent with effect from 2 October 2000 and again to 20 per cent and 25 per cent with effect from 08 November 2000 and 21 November 2000. The rate was decreased to 23 per cent with effect from 02 July and to 18 per cent with effect from 27 December 2001. (c) 3-month Treasury bills were not offered to the market at the auctions on 22 September, 29 September and 06 October 1999 in order to reduce the amount of bills maturing towards the end of December 1999 as a precautionary measure to address a possible shortage in market liquidity arising from the Y2K issue. (d) A new day count formula for Treasury bills based on international norms, was introduced with effect from 20 October 1999. Accordingly. Treasury bills are issued with 91-days, 182-days and 364-days of day counts to maturity instead of 3-month. 6-month and 12-month Treasury bills issued upto 20th October 1999.
