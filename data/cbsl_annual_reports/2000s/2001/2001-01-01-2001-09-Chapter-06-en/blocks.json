The inflation rate, by the end of the year, was the second highest over the last decade. The accumulated impact of a myriad of factors contributed to this development. Among them, the prominent factors were the following: temporary weaker supply conditions due to a prolonged drought, the direct and indirect effects of administered price adjustments in late 2000 and in 2001, international price increases of some key consumer and intermediate goods imports, currency depreciation, imposition of an import surcharge of 40 per cent on most items since mid February and the adjustments in open market prices to cover increased costs of production. Although prices of certain food items dropped in some months following the usual seasonal patterns, albeit to a lesser extent, their impact was swamped by the rising trend of price increases due to other factors.",

    "text": "Price increases in 2001, in contrast to the developments in 2000, were mainly due to the deleterious factors affecting domestic production and supply. In the year 2000, domestic food production expanded and contributed favourably to maintain price stability by dampening the mounting pressure on domestic prices emanating from import prices. Conversely in 2001, a drop in the domestic production of staple food items was a major factor that fuelled inflation. Paddy production, which recorded a bumper harvest in the previous year, fell by around 6 per cent in 2001, leading to a price increase of around 13 per cent for paddy by the end of the year. The control of rice imports thro-gh an import licensing system disrupted market forces. Accordingly, the prices of all varieties of rice were higher compared to the previous year. Rice prices reached record high levels towards the end of the year, reflecting delays in allowing imports to fill the shortage in the domestic supply. Coconut recorded a drop of around 10 per cent in",

High import duties on substitutes of coconut oil such as vegetable oils discouraged the substitution shift of demand and exerted further pressure, thereby allowing coconut prices to increase sharply. Unfavourable weather affected the production of most varieties of low country, and some varieties of upcountry vegetables. The impact was reflected in vegetable prices, which were significantly higher in 2001 compared to the previous year and, in certain cases, against reductions in the previous year. Prices of subsidiary food crops too were higher than in the previous year due to low production. As in the previous year, fish prices rose in 2001, following a drop of around 4 per cent in production due to disruptions to fishing activities.",

The Colombo Consumers' Price Index (CCPI), the official index of consumer price inflation, computed and published by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), and covering low income households in the Colombo Municipal area, registered an annual average increase of 14.2 per cent for 2001. This increase is significant when compared with the corresponding increase of 6.2 per in 2000 and 4.7 per cent in 1999. The Greater Colombo Consumer Price Index (GCPI), an alternative measurement of the aggregate price level with a broader geographical coverage than the CCPI, registered an annual average increase of 11 per cent compared to the corresponding increase of 3.2 per cent in the previous year. The Colombo District Consumer Price Index (CDCPI) too, another measure of the aggregate price level computed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) with an even wider geographical coverage than the GCPI, registered similar price developments as the other two indices. The annual average increase of the CDCPI was 10.3 per cent in 2001 as against the corresponding increase of 3.6 per cent in 2000. The above three indices measure the retail price movements of consumer items and are each confined to a selected consumption basket. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) measures the price movements at primary market level and covers both intermediate and investment goods in addition to consumer items. The price developments indicated by the WPI were also consistent with those reflected in the consumer price indices. The annual average increase of the WPI was 11.7 per cent for 2001, compared with 1.7 per cent in 2000. The GDP deflator, a more representative indicator of overall price movements as it covers overall economic activity, too reflected the price developments indicated by all other indices. The GDP deflator registered an increase of 13 per cent in 2001 compared to its increase of 6.7 per cent in the previous year.",

Hence, this index is not representative of the aggregate price level in the entire country.

Furthermore, as an initial attempt to achieve wider geographical and income group coverage on an experimental basis, in 1999, the CBSL also developed and compiled a Western Province Consumer Price Index iWPCPI), which covers the lowest 65 per cent of its households classified by income. This index was used only for internal purposes and remained unpublished. The latter 4 monthly CPI series are available from 1996 onwards. In addition lo these CPIs, the GDP Implicit Price Deflator compiled annually is also available for measuring price inflation in the country.",

The WPI registered an annual average increase of 11.7 per cent in 2001 compared to 1.7 per cent in 2000. This trend was consistent with the trends indicated by the consumer price indices discussed earlier in this section. All sub indices of the overall index recorded increases in 2001, in contrast to 2000, where marginal declines were recorded by some sub indices, including the Food sub index, which has the highest share of around 68 per cent. The annual average increase in the Food sub index in 2001 was 13.1 per cent. In the previous year this sub index registered a drop of around 2 per cent. The Petroleum products sub index, which represents the second highest share in the overall index, recorded an annual average increase of 22.5 per cent. In the previous year too, the index registered a similar increase. The Chemicals and chemical products sub index, with a share of 5.2 per cent, increased by 11.9 per cent against a low increase in the previous year. The Alcoholic drinks sub index with a relatively low share increased by 7.5 per cent. The other sub indices that marked higher annual average increases are Electrical appliances and supplies, Transport equipment and Machinery. However, their impact on the overall index was not significant due to their lower weights.",

The corresponding increase for 2000 was 2.3 per cent. This was due to the revision of the minimum wages of several Wages Boards during the year. Such revisions were introduced for Wages Boards under all three categories of activities and were reflected in the increases registered by the three sub indices; The increase for Agriculture was 2.9 per cent, Industry and commerce was 7.3 per cent and Services was 17.5 per cent.

When these nominal increases are deflated by the annual average inflation rate based on the CCPI, only the Service sector employees had experienced a real wage increase during the year, while the organised private sector as a whole reflected a loss in remuneration for their services in real terms. It should be emphasised that the minimum wages do not represent the actual remuneration packages enjoyed by organised private sector employees. Some categories of employees, especially of higher grades, receive compensation in different forms, which is normally adjusted to reflect consumer price inflation. Accordingly, in contrast to movements of minimum wage statistics, some categories of employees in the formal private sector could have maintained their real wages or even enjoyed some increases during the reference year.",

These workers are not covered by minimum wage regulations. Employees in this sector do not have collective bargaining power for wage negotiations. However, individual efforts to get an adjustment to their daily wages seemed to have some impact. Further, the wages in this sector tend to fluctuate with the changes in labour demand conditions which are closely related to production, especially in the agriculture sector. Wages also tend to respond to the market price of the product. For example, when tea prices are high there is a tendency to demand, as well as to accept, a higher daily wage to employees in that sector.",

The construction sector experienced wage increases within the range of 9 per cent to 12 per cent. Unlike in 2000, where all employee categories secured higher nominal wage increases than the inflation rate, thereby enjoying increases in real wages, a large number of employee categories suffered losses in real wages in 2001. Only some employees in the coconut cultivation sector enjoyed a real wage increase. As in the formal private sector, poor economic conditions, mainly due to the prolonged drought, could have prevented a full adjustment in nominal wages through falling labour demand, despite the higher inflation in 2001 compared to 2000.",

Successive increases in real wages without apparent improvements in productivity could lead to distortions in the labour market in the long term. Such increases could give wrong signals to job aspirants regarding their perceptions of the labour market, with a bias against the private sector and towards the public sector. These developments could disrupt efforts to create flexible labour markets that cater to the modern open market economy, which has been a long felt need. It is timely now to introduce, without further delays, a remuneration system which links wages to productivity for employees in the public sector. Wages are already related to productivity, to some extent, in the private sector. A national policy, that encompasses both the public and private sector to create a dynamic and productive labour market to meet the challenges of increasing globalisation is an urgent need in the country today.",
