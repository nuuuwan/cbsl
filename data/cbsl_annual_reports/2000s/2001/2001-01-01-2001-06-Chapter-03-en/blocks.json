The extent cultivated under annual crops was reduced during both seasons. Extents cultivated under both irrigated and rain fed conditions were affected. The distribution of rainfall was very skewed during the 2001 Yala season. Over 50 to 70 per cent of the precipitation during the South-West monsoon, was received in the month of April in a majority of the dry zone districts.

Hence, the performance of the agriculture sector has been disappointing in the recent past. Growth rates have been low. Declining production and stagnant yields have been characteristic of the sector. The only exception is the paddy sector, which has shown improvements in productivity. However, the paddy sector also faced several problems because of inconsistent policies with respect to the tariff structure and ad hoc duty waivers. A sector-wise reform in agriculture has been under consideration in different forms for some time. The salient features emerging out of these deliberations underline the importance of a new policy framework. The objective of this framework should be to improve the contribution from the sector and thereby contribute to overall economic growth. The strategy should strive to achieve improvements within the framework of a market economy by adopting new technologies and increasing productivity and competitiveness. Low rates of adoption of modern technology in farming, and large gaps between the potential yield and the actual yield suggest the",

A strong domestic agriculture sector gives a greater resilience and robustness to the domestic economy in the face of external shocks. However, the minimum acceptable levels of food self-reliance should not undermine sectoral efficiency.

The output, which exceeded 300 million kg in 2000, declined by 3.5 per cent to 295 million kg in 2001. The output in low grown teas increased marginally and accounted for over 56 per cent of the total output. In contrast, the output of high and medium grown teas declined significantly due to unfavourable weather conditions that prevailed in many parts of high and medium grown areas during the year.",

The average yield in the smallholder sector amounted to 2,212 kg. per ha. while the estimated average yield in the estate sector1 was only 1,365 kg. per ha. The national average yield at 1,786 kg. per ha. was much less than the average yield of competing countries such as Kenya. The smallholders, who are mainly concentrated in the low elevations, have high yielding vegetatively propagated tea, compared to the estate sector, which still has a substantial area under low yielding old seedling tea plantations. The scarcity of labour, especially in the low grown area, is a serious problem in the plantation sector. The Tea Research Institute (TRI) invented a mechanical hand pruner and harvester to ease the shortage of labour and to reduce cost of production. However, this mechanical harvester is not yet popular among growers.",

Export earnings in US dollar terms declined by 1 per cent to US dollars 690 million in spite of an increase in the volumes by 2 per cent due to a decline of 3.6 per cent in the average export price (fob). However, in rupee terms, earnings from tea rose by 16 per cent and exceeded Rs. 61 billion. The share of value added tea exports increased to more than 40 per cent in 2001 from 37 per cent in 2000, owing to several brand promotional activities carried out by exporters as well as the support given by the Tea Promotional Bureau during the year. It is encouraging to note that the private sector is actively taking an important role in modernising the warehousing and packaging facilities to increase value addition in the tea sector. In this context, it is important that the major Sri Lankan tea exporters develop their own brand names so as to maintain a stable market for Sri Lanka tea.",

A reduction in the application of fertiliser during both 2000 and 2001 also had a negative impact on the output in 2001. In the wake of a drop in output, the price of nuts increased sharply during the latter part of the year.

Cinnamon production increased by 17 per cent, while export volumes in raw form increased by 3 per cent during 2001. The improvement in farm gate prices and export prices contributed positively towards increased production. Approximately Rs. 250 million was earned by exporting 130 metric tons of cinnamon leaf and bark oil during the year. It is important to move to more commercially oriented research in cultivation and value addition in cinnamon to reap the benefits of being the largest producer of quality cinnamon. However, as in the other plantation sectors, the scarcity of labour is the main impediment for the development of the cinnamon industry. The problem is more acute as the peeling of cinnamon is a specialised, skilled job.",

Several plantation companies are planning to replace their rubber lands with oil palm. It is becoming a popular crop among the plantation companies in the wake of the losses incurred due to poor prices for rubber which have prevailed for a considerable period of time. The other advantage oil palm has over rubber is the low labour utilisation and the shorter gestation period. However, the disadvantage of oil palm compared to rubber is that the trunk does not have any timber or fuel value. Disposing of",

As a result, two varieties released by the Sugar Research Institute (SRI) in 1992 as high sugar varieties (viz., SL8306 and SLI 121) are still not popular among the growers.",

In early January, the subsidy rate was Rs. 8,642 per metric ton and it gradually increased to a peak level of Rs. 15,060 per metric ton by end January to accommodate increases in import price and the depreciation of the rupee. However, this rate came down gradually with the decline in world market prices and gradual stabilisation of the rupee. At end 2001, the subsidy rate was at Rs. 12,400 per metric ton. These subsidy rates were substantially higher than the rates that prevailed during 2000. As at end 2001, the total subsidy payments amounted to Rs 3,649 million and this includes the payment of a balance of Rs. 749 million carried forward from 2000.

The use of insecticides dropped by 3 per cent. In contrast, the use of herbicides and fungicides increased by 8 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively. The drop in use of insecticides can be attributed to the promotion of the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programme of the DOA, which discourages the use of insecticides. In view of the high cost of labour in agriculture, manual weeding have become relatively expensive and therefore, farmers have opted to use more herbicides to control weeds.",
