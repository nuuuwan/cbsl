    "text": "The emphasis of monetary policy was on ensuring future price stability, while maintaining stability in financial markets and assisting the domestic economy to face the severe internal and external difficulties encountered in 2001. Accordingly, the Central Bank gradually reduced its key interest rates, which had been raised in the second half of 2000 and January 2001 to provide stability to the exchange market. These rates were reduced on six occasions with a larger reduction in the second half of the year. In addition, the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) was also reduced with a view to reducing reliance on non-market oriented instruments in the conduct of monetary policy, improving downward flexibility in the interest rates of banks and augmenting rupee liquidity in the market. Meanwhile, the Central Bank's purchases of foreign exchange in 2001 entirely reduced the large rupee liquidity shortage in the money market that continued from 2000. In order to improve operational effectiveness in the conduct of monetary policy, particularly following the change in the exchange rate regime to an independent float, the institutional framework for monetary policy decision making was changed.",

The tightened monetary policy stance followed in the second half of 2000 to arrest the deterioration in the balance of payments, and provide stability to the foreign exchange market was further strengthened in January 2001. The Bank raised its Repurchase (Repo) rate and Reverse Repurchase (Reverse Repo) rate by 300 basis points, to 20 per cent and 23 per cent, respectively, on 18 January 2001. However, with the stability in foreign and domestic money markets following the introduction of the independent float of the rupee and reductions in interest rates in major international markets, the Central Bank gradually reduced its Repo and Reverse Repo rates on six occasions since February 2001. The pace of relaxation was constrained by the rise in inflation in the first half of the year. As overall monetary and credit growth was within the projected levels, containing demand fuelled inflationary pressure, and the slowing down of the economy warranted such changes, a larger reduction to the Central Bank's key interest rates was effected during the second half of the year. After January, the Repo rate was reduced by 800 basis points to 12 per cent while the Reverse Repo rate was reduced by 900 basis points to 14 per cent by end 2001. The Bank Rate was reduced from 25 per cent to 23 per cent in July",

The purchase of foreign exchange by banks from the Central Bank, large borrowings by the public sector from the banking system and the settlement of foreign public debt had resulted in a liquidity shortfall of around Rs.30 billion at the beginning of 2001. Commercial banks borrowed from the Central Bank through the Reverse Repo window to replenish the shortfall in interbank liquidity. However, injections of rupee liquidity by the Central Bank through the purchase of foreign currency from the market to build up its reserves and the purchase of the dollar proceeds of the Sri Lanka Development Bonds and the privatisation proceeds of the government improved domestic market liquidity. The reduction of the SRR too contributed to improve liquidity. As a result, the liquidity position turned to a surplus of Rs. 1 billion by December 2001.",

In addition, the slowdown in the economy was also a factor in reducing the demand for cash. Furthermore, as financial transactions become more technology oriented and the use of ATM cards, credit cards increases, there tends to be a reduction in narrow money. Meanwhile, broad money (M4) based on the financial survey, which includes the operations of licensed specialised banks and finance companies, in addition to licensed commercial banks, grew by 13.6 per cent at end 2001 as against a growth of 12.7 per cent at end 2000.",

    "text": "The increase in net domestic assets was brought about by a large increase in public sector (i.e., government and public corporations) credit and a moderate increase in private sector credit. The increased fiscal deficit, together with less than expected inflows from privatisation and foreign borrowings, caused the government to increase sharply its net borrowings from the domestic banking sector by Rs.54 billion, almost to the same level as in 2000. Some compositional shift was also seen in net credit to the government (NCG) with borrowings from the Central Bank, which constitute the creation of expansionary reserve money, being replaced by borrowings from commercial banks. NCG from the Central Bank declined with the reduction in the holdings of government paper, though provisional advances from the Bank increased. The reduction in the holdings of government paper was a consequence of a decline in injection of liquidity through reverse repurchase transactions, as market liquidity improved. NCG from commercial banks increased as overdrafts, sight bills, holdings of government paper including dollar denominated Sri Lanka Development Bonds and borrowings from FCBUs increased. The high level of public sector borrowing was a factor that led to interest rates not decreasing further.",

However, credit utilised by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) increased due to adverse weather conditions requiring it to opt for expensive thermal power, as well as due to the continuation of an average tariff rate that was below the average cost of power.

The annual growth of private sector credit declined from 12 per cent in 2000 to 9 per cent in 2001. In absolute terms, credit to the private sector increased by Rs.32 billion as against Rs.38 billion in 2000. The decline in credit growth was partly driven by the moderation in economic activity and the decline in business confidence. High interest rates, and the cautious approach taken by many banks to improve their risk management due to high levels of non-performing loans too would have contributed to this decline. The breakdown of private sector credit by economic activity reveals that the credit for consumption, housing and property development and services grew, while credit to industries, trade and agriculture sectors declined.",

With greater stability in the domestic foreign exchange and money markets, declining international interest rates, and reduced inflationary pressures, the Central Bank reduced its key policy rates, i.e., the Repo rate, Reverse Repo rate, and the Bank Rate, several times during the year, notably in the second half. These reductions, assisted by increases'in market liquidity, resulted in a fall in short-term market rates. The prime lending rates of commercial banks and the yield on market oriented government securities fell commensurately. The general lending rates of commercial banks, however, declined less and at a slower pace, resulting in the real return of these general lending rates remaining still appreciably high. Some reduction in deposit rates was also seen. A downward shift in the yield curve of government paper was seen towards the end of the year. In addition, fiscal measures",

    "text": "The Central Bank's key monetary policy rates are the Repo rate and Reverse Repo rate, which are closely linked to market rates, and the Bank Rate, which is more an indicative rate. The Repo rate is the rate at which commercial banks and primary dealers can invest their surplus funds in Treasury bonds and Treasury bills held by the Central Bank, while the Reverse Repo rate is the rate at which commercial banks and primary dealers can obtain funds from the Central Bank against the collateral of Treasury bills and bonds. Repo and Reverse Repo rates are the Central Bank's signalling mechanism to indicate the expected direction of interest rates in the market. The Repo and Reverse Repo rates had increased during the second half of 2000 as the Bank tightened monetary policy to provide stability to the exchange market. They were raised, as a temporary measure, by an additional 300 basis points each in January 2001 to reach a peak of 20 per cent and 23 per cent, respectively by the third week of January. Following the restoration of stability to the foreign exchange market and gaining of experience under the flotation of the rupee, the Repo and Reverse Repo rates were reduced by 100 basis points each in February, and 50 basis points each in April. More substantial reductions could not be effected in the first half as inflation began to increase. However, with the inflationary pressures declining and greater stability in the foreign exchange market, the rates were reduced on four occasions, during the period July to December 2001. Thus, during the second half of 2001, the Repo rate was reduced by 650 basis points and the Reverse Repo rate by 750 basis points to end the year at 12.00 per cent and 14.00 per cent, respectively.

In the second half, with the reduction in the Bank's rates and the increase in market liquidity, call market rates fell substantially. By end December 2001, there was a small excess of rupee liquidity in the market, causing commercial banks to access the Central Bank's repurchase facility. As a result, the average call market rate moved towards the lower end of the Bank's Repo-Reverse Repo band. At end 2001, the average call market rate was 12.65 per cent, while the call market rate moved within the range of 12.50 - 13.00 per cent.",

Lending rates on export financing facilities came down from 21 per cent at the beginning of the year to 17.5 per cent towards the end of the year. Rates on import finance facilities, on average, declined from 21 per cent to 19.6 per cent during the same period. The Average Weighted Deposit Rate (AWDR), which is based on the weighted average of all outstanding interest bearing deposits of commercial banks and the corresponding interest rates, reached its highest level (11.55 per cent) in June, and decreased to 10.78 per cent by December 2001. The Average Weighted Fixed Deposit Rate (AWFDR), which was 13.27 per cent in January, increased to 14.70 per cent in July and then decreased to 13.47 per cent in December.

    "text": "Commercial banks as financial intermediaries accept deposits from individuals and institutions who have surplus funds and make loans available to investors who have deficits m their spending units. In this process of intermediation, banks raise funds at a certain rate and lend at a higher rate, keeping enough to cover administrative costs and earn a return for the risk assumed. The difference between the average lending rate and the cost of mobilised funds/loanable funds is the intermediation cost or the interest spread of a bank. In Sri Lanka, intermediation costs of commercial banks arc considered to be high due to several reasons and are a major concern of the business community. The high intermediation cost of banks is likely to be a reflection of inefficiency in the financial system, which leaves both savers and investors worse off. When intermediation costs arc high, the interest rate structure in the financial system becomes distorted, leading to an inefficient allocation of capital resources in the economy. Increased borrowing costs affect entrepreneurs and this may also have some impact on loan defaults. As such, high intermediation costs of banks have a significant adverse effect on economic activities in the country. Therefore, this is an issue of economic significance that needs to be addressed.",

Other than deposits, banks use borrowings for lending purposes as and when required. Although a bank would also have capital funds, these would be small in magnitude in relation to deposits and borrowed funds.

The reserve cost is implicitly reflected in their lending rates. Non performing loans I'NPLS) of commercial banks also generate an indirect cost for commercial banks. High NPLs, while reducing a bank's interest earnings, increase the banks provisioning, which affects the profitability of banks. Moreover, ihey reduce the availability of loanable funds in a bank by reducing collections. Other operating expenses of a bank also have an important bearing on the cost of funds of a bank since a certain portion of the operating cost is incurred in mobilising loanable funds. However, it is difficult to separate clearly the operating expenses between raising loanable funds and other activities, except provisioning for non-performing loans, which is directly related lo the lending activities of banks. Although one can argue that operating expenses of banks could be disaggregated into expenses on mobilising loanable funds and other operating expenses by applying the ratio between interest income and non-interest income of commercial banks to total operating expenses, such a breakdown could be misleading because a certain portion of non interest income He., loan application processing fees, inspection and valuation charges etc.) is also earned from lending activities. -",

This principle was first introduced to Sri Lanka with the passage of Amending Ordinance, No.24 of 1939 to the Ceylon State Mortgage Bank Ordinance. No.16 of 1931. The right of Parate execution was gradually extended to other government owned financial and non financial institutions such as Bank of Ceylon, People's Bank, National Savings Bank, National Housing Development Authority and National Development Bank, by the specific statutes under which these institutions weie established. Therefore, there was no single statute governing Parate execution .until the introduction of the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act, No.4 of 1990, as amended by Act, No.24 of 1995, which extended the power of Parate execution to all Licensed Commercial Banks (I.CBs'i as defined in the Banking Act.

It provides a \"summary procedure\" for liquid claims for recovery of monies due on cheques, promissory notes etc. In addition, the Mortgage Act, No.6 of 1949, introduced Hypothecary Action, (an action to obtain an order declaring the mortgaged property to be bound and executable for the payment of the moneys due upon the mortgage and to enforce such payment by a judicial sale of the mortgaged property) for the recovery of monies due upon a mortgage property to any approved credit agency as defined in Section 333 of the Companies Ordinance.

In 19S5, the Justice Wimalaratnc Commission made far-reaching proposals to speed up the bad debts recovery procedure. On these recommendations, the Government, in 1990, passed into law a package of 14 debt related laws, one of which was the Recovery of Loans bv Banks ('Special Provisions)) ALI, NO.4 of 1990.

One of the reasons is the poor credit culture in the country whereby many borrowers appear to think that money borrowed does not have to be repaid. This category of borrowers termed as wilful defaulters do not settle debts, not due to their inability, but due to unwillingness. Those borrowers whose properties were auctioned may be the ones who were genuinely unable to repay.",

Banks engage in a business and they have a fundamental responsibility to their shareholders. The data available do not suggest that banks use the power of PaMte executions extensively to the detriment of entrepreneurs. Yet, banks should be prudent in the use of Parate execution powers against genuine borrowers facing difficulties in repaying their loans, particularly due to reasons beyond their control. Some of the businesses could be rejuvanated by rescheduling their loans, lowering penal rates or giving a moratorium. However, if there is an unusuallv high number of business failures, the solution lies not in the abolition of Parate execution or change in debt recovery laws, but in addressing the real causal issues that affect such failures.",

As the foreign exchange market became relatively stable, the Central Bank was able to purchase foreign currency from commercial banks. The government sold its foreign receipts to the Central Bank, particularly proceeds from privatisation and the receipts from Sri Lanka Development Bonds. These transactions increased the Bank's foreign assets. The injection of rupee liquidity to the market reduced the need for commercial banks to access the Central Bank's reverse repurchase window to obtain liquidity. Consequently, the Bank's holdings of government paper declined.",

The forward sales contract system (FSCS), which was initially introduced in a few districts in 1999, was expanded to other districts in 2001. The system is becoming increasingly popular among farmers as well as the buyers of agricultural products in Hambantota, Polonnaruwa, Matale and Badulla districts where major crops like paddy, maize, soya, sesame and big onion are grown. Forward prices that are determined by mutual agreement between the farmer and the buyer proved to be realistic and were treated as a base price by many farmers and buyers in the areas where forward sales contracts were popular. This mechanism has, therefore, prevented sharp fluctuations of prices of crops in major producing areas.",

Under the widened scope of NCRCS, new eligible investment activities for loans, such as manufacturing of seed and planting materials on a commercial scale by individuals and companies and purchasing and storage of agricultural produce, were included under the FSCS. The objective of the government decision on writing off of loans was to provide relief to farmers whose cultivation was affected by the severe drought that prevailed in major agricultural areas. Accordingly, two state banks, six Regional Development Banks and the Co-operative Rural Banks have taken steps to write off loans amounting to approximately Rs.187 million. However, the more prudent policy option is the rescheduling of loans in such temporary difficult situations as the practice of writing off loans would not only result in unequal treatment of the borrowers who",

Further, banks usually tend to demand collateral in the form of land, buildings and equipment, and guarantees from third parties, when granting loans. This acts as a constraint to the borrowers who may not be able to provide acceptable collateral.

The market capitalisation of listed debt securities at the Colombo Stock Exchange is about Rs.7 billion (US dollars 0.07 billion) in comparison to the market capitalisation of Rs. 112 billion (1;S dollars 1.2 billion) in the stock market.

Initially, the private sector service providers charged fees from borrowers who obtained loans under the Project for which the extension services were obtained from them. Subsequently, in November 2001, the Project Office too commenced charging fees from borrowers for the services rendered by it in the districts where the private service providers were not providing those services. This system was introduced as a pilot project under the Ministry of Agriculture and was monitored by the Pilot Project Monitoring Unit to ensure the continuous provision of this service to farmers even after the termination of the foreign funded project and to accustom farmers to obtain fee-based services instead of depending on free services from the government.",

The idea of having post-harvest insurance emerged from members of farmer organisations, who have signed forward sales contract agreements with buyers, to protect their harvest from unforeseen risks until they are able to fulfil their contracts. This development can be viewed as a further step towards a farmer friendly insurance system, as well as a market-oriented development from the point of view of the farmers.",

Therefore, credit disbursements under the donor funded and government-funded schemes increased considerably.

Farmers were encouraged by the better prices ensured under the contracts for their produce while buyers were encouraged by the prospects of regular supplies and better quality. It was also observed that farmers, in order to obtain a better price, have attempted to improve the quality of their produce while the availability of a better price for their crop, in turn, encouraged farmers to increase production. Therefore, while the FSCS encourages the farmers to invest more in agriculture, buyers can plan their investments with assured availability of high quality agricultural produce at reasonable prices, so that both parties benefit by entering into forward sales contracts. These sales agreements served to facilitate the bankers in the supply of credit to small farmers and the buyers who agreed to purchase these commodities at a pre-determined price.",

Inculcating the savings habit among farmers was another objective. At end 2001, 452 Farmers' Banks (FBs) had been established at Agrarian Services Centres (Govi Jana Kendra) with 219,254 farmers as shareholders. This reflects an increase in membership by 37 per cent. A member farmer is required to buy at least 1 share of Rs.100 of the FBs. The share capital of the FBs stood at Rs.22 million at end 2001 compared to Rs.16 million in 2000. Individual savings of the farmers stood at Rs.38 million, of which Rs.14 million had been mobilised during the year. Loans to the value of Rs.80 million each had been disbursed to farmers for paddy and cash crops during 2000/2001 Maha and 2001 Yala seasons with relatively low recovery rates of 78 and 57 per cent, respectively. The FBs expanded the credit facilities for farmers to purchase two-wheel and four-wheel tractors and introduced a loan scheme to enable the farmers to keep their harvest until the market price goes up. The scheme is known \"Vee Surekum'. Under the scheme, a farmer is given a loan at the rate of Rs.lO per bushel to meet his immediate consumption needs until the stock of paddy is sold.",

The deposit base of NSB was further strengthened in 2001 through a number of measures: introduction of new deposit schemes, customer oriented banking, aggressive marketing campaigns, adjustment of interest rates in line with market trends and increased automation of operations. The total deposits of the NSB grew by 13 per cent to Rs.I19 billion at end 2001, while the total assets grew at the same rate to reach Rs. 130 billion.",

This was mainly due to a large reduction in lending by the National Housing Development Authority due to a decrease in its funding sources from the government in 2001 and a considerable reduction of credit approvals by the large development banks consequent on the reduced demand for credit. The total loans granted by these institutions declined by 9 per cent to Rs.21,816 million in 2001. While the two main development banks, namely, DFCC Bank and NDB, mainly assisted the industrial sector of the economy, SMIB, NDB Housing Bank Ltd. and the two non-bank HFIs provided facilities to the housing sector. NSB's investments were mainly in government securities, while its loan portfolio was dominated by the housing sector.

The growth in total assets had entirely been funded by money raised though deposits. Borrowings from other sources such as commercial and investment banks had been reduced significantly. The higher interest rates prevailing in the commercial banks would have contributed to the reduction in such borrowings. The total capital funds had grown by about 12 per cent, mainly due to an increase in the reserves. The change in the funding mix is further evident from the fact that borrowings as a ratio of total liabilities declined to 3 per cent from 7 per cent in the previous year, while the ratio of fixed deposits increased to 63 per cent in 2001 from 55 per cent in 2000.",

The increased investment in debt instruments, particularly in government debt securities, was the major contributory factor for the growth in total investment, since the equity investments had not shown any significant variation. Investment in government paper increased due to their attractive yields and weak private sector demand for loans, hire purchase and leasing. The loans and advances portfolio had recorded a 8 per cent growth, as a result of increases in real estate loans and leasing activities. Real estate loans accounted for a large share of the increase in the total loan portfolio. Meanwhile, hire purchase loans decreased by about 8 per cent.",

Of the two instruments used for reverse repo transactions, Treasury bonds were more popular, accounting for about 95 per cent of the total turnover.

The imposition of a 20 per cent surcharge on corporate income tax with effect from April 2001, for a period of one year, was another factor that adversely affected share market activity. The last quarter of the year 2001, however, saw a reversal in market trends, with all key market indicators recording significant improvements.

Market capitalisation, which had declined to Rs.80 billion at the end of the third quarter from Rs.89 billion at the end of the year 2000, increased to Rs.124 billion by end-2001. The All Share Price Index (ASPI) and the Milanka Price Index (MPI), which had declined by 10 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively, during the first three quarters of the year, recorded gains of 38.7 per cent and 47.6 per cent, for the year as a whole. By end-2001, the ASPI, which closed at 621, had recorded the highest annual growth rate since 1993 (61.7 per cent), while the MPI, which was introduced in 1999, reached an all time high of 1,164 on 10 December 2001 and closed the year at 1,031. The highest daily turnover recorded on the CSE of Rs.867 million was also recorded on 10 December 2001. Meanwhile, the average daily turnover for December 2001, which was Rs.258 million, was the highest during any month since February 1994. The increase in market activity at the CSE in the last quarter 2001 was primarily accounted for by domestic retail traders, and was attributed to a change of market sentiment, following the election of a new government. Despite the turnover at the CSE increasing to record levels, foreigners remained net sellers in 2001 as in the previous year, with many of them making significant profits whilst exiting the market, following the rally. The net outflow in 2001 was US dollars 11 million, compared with US dollars 44 million in 2000, with purchases and sales by foreigners amounting to US dollars 23 million and US dollars 34 million, respectively. In contrast to these developments at the CSE, most international markets recorded declines in their indices for the year 2001.",

In comparison, the total value of bonus issues made by 15 companies during the previous year was Rs.2,541 while the value of rights issues made by 8 companies was Rs.713 million. The declines reflected reduced profitability in the corporate sector due to the slowdown in economic activity. The debt securities market expanded further in 2001.

The significant increase in share prices towards the end of the year, particularly those of blue chip companies, resulted in the market price earnings ratio increasing to 7.5 by end 2001 from 5.2 at the end of the previous year. While the ASPI and the MPI increased, along with the increase in the volume of turnover, share prices and market capitalisation, sectoral indices also reflected these improved market conditions. All sectoral indices, with the exception of the Stores & supplies index, recorded improvements by the end of the year. However, information on corporate sector performance in the first three quarters of the year indicate a decline in profits of many listed companies, when compared with the corresponding period of the previous year. For example, of the top 30 companies by market capitalisation, which accounted for 62 per cent of the market capitalisation by end 2001, twenty recorded declines in profits. Of the top 10 companies ranked by market capitalisation, which accounted for 37 per cent of the market capitalisation by end 2001, profits declined in eight.

However, by the end of the third quarter, having been subjected to the contagion effects of September 11, the Bombay BSE Sensitive Index had declined by 29 per cent when compared with the end-2000 level. It recovered in November and December, which investors attributed to technology and industry stocks gaining ground as well as low interest rates. Meanwhile in Karachi, the KSE-100, which declined over much of the year, regained in the last quarter, as domestic retail and institutional investors, particularly the state-run mutual funds bought key shares, amidst mounting anticipation of debt relief by western donors and the central bank taking steps to bring down interest rates. The KSE-100, which had declined by 25 per cent from end-2000 to end September, closed the year with an overall decline of 16 per cent.",

The yield on bonds of both maturities declined during the year, in line with market trends in interest rates. All issues of Treasury bonds were oversubscribed, given the relatively high yield, particularly in the first half of the year, and the reduced demand for credit from the private sector.
