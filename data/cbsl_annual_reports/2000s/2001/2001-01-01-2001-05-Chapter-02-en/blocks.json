    "text": "factors that dampened world economic growth in 2001. Delayed recovery in the US economy, downturn in Europe and a continuing slump in Japan triggered the global slowing down during the first half of the year. This trend, which was earlier expected to reverse during the second half of 2001, was exacerbated by the terrorist attacks in USA during the latter part of the year. The slowing down of OECD countries' economies extended to the rest of the world, with declines in information technology spending affecting East Asian countries and deteriorating financing conditions affecting a number of emerging markets, especially in Latin America. Short-term economic forecasts were revised downward repeatedly for virtually all the major economies. Slower growth prospects translated into lower demand for developing country exports and lower prices for many primary commodities. With the exception of a few countries such as China, India, Russia and Vietnam, most others were badly affected by the slowing down of the world economy. Global output growth for 2001 is estimated at 2.4 per cent, sharply lower than the previous projection of 4.2 per cent, and well below last year's growth of 4.8 per cent and the average growth in the last decade of 3 per cent. This was also reflected in the growth of world trade. In 2000, the volume of world trade grew by over 10 per cent, while in 2001 it slumped to less than 1 per cent. The Sri Lankan economy, which thrived in 2000 with a global boom, shrank in 2001 with global gloom. The contraction of the Sri Lankan economy, however, was relatively sharper owing to difficulties experienced on the domestic front.",

In addition, quota free and concessionary access granted by USA to the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan countries also adversely affected the competitiveness of Sri Lankan textile and garment exports to USA. The experiences in 2001 indicate that, to remain in the market, Sri Lanka has to be more competitive and has to explore non-traditional markets away from the major buyer, USA. Also, the most important lesson learnt was that the export oriented industrial sector urgently needs a structural change and a broader diversification from the apparel and garment industry. Increases in cost of production also caused a decline in value addition in the Manufacturing sector, in general. Prices of utilities such as electricity, water and telecommunications and of fuel increased considerably in 2001 compared with the previous year. In addition, the continuing power cuts during the latter half of the year negatively affected performance and profitability in the Manufacturing sector.",

    "text": "In 2001, value added in the Agriculture sector declined by 3 per cent. The contraction was largely due to the adverse weather conditions that prevailed throughout the year. Unlike in the other two sectors, i.e., Industry and Services, the Agriculture sector had experienced fluctuations over the years, as the performance in this sector is heavily dependent on weather conditions. Recently, in 1992 and 1996, too, the Agriculture sector suffered contractions under adverse weather conditions. However, the long run problem in the Agriculture sector, which has hindered its growth capability, has been the low level of productivity. In recent years, productivity improvements were observed in some areas of plantation agriculture and domestic agriculture. Of the plantation agriculture, productivity in tea cultivation improved due to better management and cultivation practices followed by the private management companies. In the domestic agriculture sector, productivity in paddy cultivation improved during the last decade owing to several factors. The improved seed paddy available to farmers through the private sector following the removal of the government monopoly in this field and the adoption of the technology package introduced by the Yaya demonstration programme of the Department of Agriculture, improved yields especially in the irrigated paddy lands. The abandoning of cultivation in marginal rain fed lands where the productivity was low also enhanced the overall efficiency in paddy cultivation. Against this background, the decline in value addition in Agriculture in 2001 can be treated as a cyclical one that will recover with normal weather patterns.",

Accordingly, the Investment/GDP ratio, which peaked at 28 per cent in 2000, dropped in 2001 to 22 per cent. The decline in investment was entirely an outcome of a decline in private investment by 14.5 per cent. Government investment, which could have mitigated the negative impact of falling private investment, remained below the desired level due to budgetary constraints. The growth of government investment, in 2001, was limited to 2.1 per cent. The downturn in private sector investment can be attributed to a host of factors including the contraction in real GDP growth, decline in corporate savings and the excess capacity available in industries due to the sluggish local and international demand. In addition, uncertainty on the political front and inconsistent policy signals also had a negative impact on business confidence and consequently on private sector investment. The decline in investment expenditure was reflected in imports where the importation of capital goods fell by 38 per cent in US dollar terms during the year. However, in 2000, SriLankan Airlines had invested US dollars 297 million to purchase three aircraft. When this one time occurrence is excluded, the decline in overall investment in 2001 falls to 6.5 per cent and the decline in capital goods imports falls to 25 per cent. The decline in investment expenditure does not augur well for the economy, as investment plays a key role in the future growth potential of a country.",

In comparison, the domestic market oriented industries performed satisfactorily and were able to partly offset the negative impact created by the export oriented industries. These industries, which include food processing, beverages, building materials, pharmaceuticals and detergents, milk products, animal feed, PVC, and plastics and metal products, blossomed during the first half of the year with increased domestic demand following numerous sales promotion activities such as aggressive advertising, discounts, free offers, incentive gift vouchers, and price discrimination.

The drought that prevailed throughout the year adversely affected the production of low country vegetables. Subsidiary food crops recorded a drop of 4.5 per cent. This was another adverse outcome of the failure of both the North-East as well as the South-West monsoons. Production volumes of all varieties of subsidiary food crops other than potatoes declined. Potato production showed a sharp increase of 19 per cent, which was an outcome of the very heavy protection provided to potato farmers through the specific duty imposed on imported potatoes.",

The negative growth was mainly due to the decline in value added in road haulage, which was associated with the contraction in domestic production as well as external trade. However, the passenger transport sector performed well and partly mitigated the negative impact of the freight transport sub sector. Improvements in the public transport sector contributed to this development.

However, the existing system of National Accounts in Sri Lanka estimates savings through the investment approach, a methodology widely accepted and broadly followed. Accordingly, domestic savings are estimated as a residual, the difference between investment and external resources (defined as the net imports of goods and non-factor services). Domestic savings, which include private savings and government savings, were estimated at Rs 215 billion for 2001, a decline of 2.1 per cent over the previous year. The decline in domestic savings in 2001 was solely due to the 60 per cent deterioration in government savings, which is defined as the current account balance of the government budget.
