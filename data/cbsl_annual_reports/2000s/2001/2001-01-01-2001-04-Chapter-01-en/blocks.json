The global recession, which adversely affected the performance of manufacturing and external trade, accounted for about two thirds of the loss in expected output. The prolonged drought, which had an adverse impact on agricultural output and hydropower generation, was the second major contractionary factor, accounting directly for a reduction in GDP by about 13 per cent. The other factors, including the impact of the terrorist attack, through a reduction in tourist arrivals and the disturbance of port and aviation services, accounted for the balance. The economic slowdown was widespread, reducing the output in all major sectors; agriculture (-3.0 per cent), industry (-2.0 per cent) and services (-0.5 per cent). On the aggregate expenditure side, the investment/GDP ratio declined to 22.0 per cent in 2001 from 26.2 per cent in 2000 (28.0 per cent without adjusting for investment in aircraft) owing to weaker investor confidence and a shortfall in the expected public investment. Meanwhile, the national savings/ GDP ratio also declined to 19.5 per cent in 2001 from 21.5 per cent in 2000, reflecting increased government dissavings and the impact of the contraction in income on private sector savings. The slowdown in both economic growth and investment expansion reduced employment creation, compared with previous years, raising the unemployment rate marginally to 7.8 per cent at the end of the third quarter,",

    "text": "Budget 2001 was formulated to improve fiscal consolidation, correcting the fiscal slippages of 2000. However, there was a significant deterioration in the fiscal situation. Revenue shortfalls (Rs. 33 billion) and current expenditure overruns (Rs. 19 billion) resulted in a higher overall budget deficit of 10.9 per cent of GDP, compared with 8.5 per cent of GDP in the original budgetary estimates. The increased fiscal deficit, together with the shortfalls in privatisation proceeds (Rs.16 billion) and lower utilisation of foreign financing (Rs. 21 billion), raised the domestic deficit financing to Rs. 124 billion (8.8 per cent of GDP), compared with a budgetary estimate of Rs. 57 billion. Consequently, the government debt has risen to 103.6 per cent of GDP, making the interest bill the largest expenditure component in the Budget.",

This slowdown is considered to be the most widespread among the major countries since World War II. It was also accompanied by a marked decline in the expansion of international trade and services, significantly lower commodity prices, and low international capital flows into emerging market economies and developing countries. These gloomy conditions in the world economy compelled international organisations and most countries to revise downward, from time to time, their annual growth projections during 2001.

The slowing down in the world economy from the early part of the year, which was aggravated into a recession by the September 11 attacks on the US, was estimated to be the major reason. The world recession had highly deleterious effects on the demand for manufactured goods, which, in turn, caused a sharp contraction in Sri Lanka's international trade. Consequently, it is estimated that almost two thirds of the loss in projected output was due to the world recession. Meanwhile, the very severe drought had its direct impact primarily on agriculture and electricity, and is estimated as having been responsible for around 13 per cent of the output decline. The direct impact of the attack on Katunayake is estimated to be marginal (about 2 per cent of the decline in output), although its negative fallout is expected to have had a far greater adverse impact indirectly. The secondary and indirect effect of these shocks had ripple effects on all sectors, and was responsible for a little over one fifth of the output loss. The combined impact of all these shocks is estimated to have resulted in an output loss of around Rs. 56 billion or 6.5 percentage points of GDP in 2001.",

Several factors were responsible, most notably changes in administered prices to adjust for international price changes, supply constraints in domestic food items due to the drought, increases in the prices of imported commodities due to increases in international prices, duties and surcharges on imports, increases in the international prices of goods and the effect of the depreciation of the currency. It is estimated that, had the normal underlying factors prevailed, average inflation based on the CCPI would have been around 7.5 per cent in 2001, as against the realised average inflation of 14.2 per cent. Hence, the difference, i.e.. 6.7 percentage points, could broadly be attributed to the direct and indirect effects of the shocks and the impact of increases in administered prices. The average increase in the CCPI, if the administered prices were held at the levels that prevailed at the end of December 1997. was 11.6 per cent (i.e.. 2.6 per percentage points below the increase in the average value of the CCPI). Thus, the average increase in the CCPI due to the shocks can be estimated at 4.1 percentage points.",

The expected increase was based on the improved competitiveness following the implementation of the stabilisation programme and the quota-free access to EU markets. The sharp decline in world economic activity, and the reduction in tea production due to the drought, ultimately led to a contraction in exports. In view of the fact that the first half of the year experienced a 10.5 per cent growth in tourist arrivals, tourism was expected to perform extremely well in 2001 and around 450,000 tourist arrivals were expected. However, the July attack at Katunayake and the September 11 attacks in the US virluall) brought the tourist industry to a standstill. It is estimated that export earnings were around US dollars 1.175 million below the expected earnings in 2001, while tourist earnings were around US dollars 70 million less than expected, due to these external shocks.",

    "text": "On the fiscal front, the reduction in imports and the contraction in domestic economic activities directly brought down government revenues. In the meantime, the increased expenditure on defence and the relief package given to resuscitate the economv were directly responsible for expenditure overruns. The resulting increase in the budget deficit led to increased borrowings, together with an enhancement in the cost of borrowings. This inevitably raised the level of public debt. It is estimated that the revenue loss due to the three external shocks amounted to about 1.8 percentage points of GDP, while the expenditure increase was around 0.4 percentage points of GDP. Thus, the fiscal outturn would have vielded a fiscal deficit of about 2.2 percentage points of GDP above the budgeted estimate. This was controlled by a significant reduction in capital expenditure, which however, leads to adverse long-run effects of reduction in capital creation and hence, future output potential.",

Meanwhile, the Census of Population and Housing - 2001 conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics after 20 years showed a mid-year 2001 population of 18.73 million'a). Thus, the average (per capita) GDP in nominal terms increased by 9.8 per cent to Rs.74,760 in 2001. Given the GDP deflator reflecting an inflation in prices of 13 per cent, it is possible that the average living conditions of Sri Lankans would have deteriorated in 2001. In US dollar terms, the per capita GDP showed a decline of 6.9 per cent from US dollars 899 to 837, following a 15.1 per cent depreciation of the average exchange rate.",

This drop was reflected in he smallholder and plantation sectors. The decline in output is due to the abandoning of tapping, attributed to unremunerative prices. Meanwhile, a growing demand for rubber trees as timber and rubber land for real estate development has further reduced the extent under rubber cultivation. A continuation of depressed rubber prices for a long time now has discouraged the application of fertiliser, thereby reducing rubber yields. Sri Lanka is the world's largest industrial tyre manufacturer. In addition, a wide range of rubber based manufacturing products including gloves, pneumatic tyres and tubes too use natural rubber as the major input. Reflecting the weak export demand for manufactured products, the consumption of rubber in the domestic industrial sector declined by 2 per cent in 2001. Similarly, the rubber wood industry too suffered a setback in 2001 due to the weakening demand.",

The CPC introduced a long overdue flexible pricing policy for petroleum products at end 2001. Under the new pricing policy, local prices of major petroleum products are expected to be revised monthly, based on changes in the cost of production. With this pricing system, any gain or loss due to the fluctuation of international crude oil prices, exchange rate or any other input will be passed on to consumers according to a formula. A debt recovery adjustment factor has also been incorporated into the pricing formula in order to settle the existing debt of CPC, amounting to about Rs.19 billion at end 2001. Following the end of the monopoly period, a new local company entered the LP gas market creating competition. Consumers have already benefited from the competition through lower prices and improved services.",

The improved competition in the Colombo Port with the commencement of operations of the South Asia Gateway Terminal Ltd.

Productivity indicators such as the number of containers handled per hour and average waiting time for berthing of main line container vessels improved in the past few years, but are still well below the level of other efficient ports such as Singapore.

The prolonged drought resulted in temporary shortages in many domestically produced food items, raising their prices sharply. The direct impact and passthrough effect of upward revisions in petroleum prices, water tariff and the wheat flour price, and the imposition of a surcharge on electricity tariff were partly responsible for the high price increases observed in 2001. In addition to high international prices for some imported food items, the imposition of a 40 per cent import surcharge, high tariff protection for imported edible oil and potatoes and the licensing restriction on rice imports also contributed to high price increases in 2001. The high tariff on edible oil imports led to the sharp increase in coconut prices with the reduction of domestic coconut production, while restrictions on rice",

The increased fiscal deficit, together with the shortfall in the expected privatisation proceeds (Rs.16.4 billion) and external financing (Rs. 20.6 billion), both concessional and commercial borrowings, compelled the government to borrow heavily from domestic sources. Domestic borrowing amounted to 8.8 per cent of GDP compared with the budgetary target of 4 per cent of GDP. This led to a significant increase in government domestic bank borrowing (Rs.48.5 billion) in contrast to the expected repayment (Rs.ll billion) in the original estimates, as the available domestic non-bank resources were limited. Increased domestic borrowing continued to exert pressure on domestic interest rates and crowded out resources available to the private sector. Consequently, the outstanding public debt increased sharply by Rs.231.9 billion to Rs. 1,450.6 billion raising the public debt/GDP ratio to 103,6 per cent at end 2001, giving a warning signal about the worsening of the public debt burden and highlighting the need for strong fiscal adjustments to ensure macroeconomic stability.",

Second, some of the fiscal adjustments announced in the Budget were not implemented, thus preventing the realisation of expenditure savings and thereby resulting in an increase in recurrent expenditure by Rs.15.3 billion.

    "text": "The level of the government debt stock (Rs. 1,450.6 billion) exceeded the national income in 2001, reflecting a faster growth in the debt stock than nominal GDP. The debt/ GDP ratio, which declined in the mid-1990s, has increased continuously since 1997, reaching 103.6 per cent at end 2001. The sharp expansion in domestic borrowing, due to the widening fiscal deficit and the increase in the rupee value of foreign debt, due to the depreciation of the exchange rate were the major causal factors for this rise in the debt stock. Within the overall government debt stock, domestic debt increased by 4.5 percentage points to 58.3 per cent of GDP, while foreign debt increased by 2.2 percentage points to 45.3 per cent of GDP during 2001. The sharp increase in government debt with an escalating debt service burden and a continuation of high fiscal deficits raised the issue of medium-term fiscal sustainability, even though a large part (about 95 per cent) of foreign debt is on highly concessional terms. Therefore, containing the fiscal deficit, improving government debt management and a cautious approach to foreign commercial borrowing are necessary and should be adopted, without further delay, in order to move towards a sustainable fiscal path in the medium term.",

Similarly, the total outstanding public sector debt, including debt held by public corporations, amounting to Rs.40.8 billion, was Rs.1,491.4 billion, (106.5 per cent of GDP). Therefore, in addressing the public sector debt issue effectively, it is also necessary to give due attention to improving the financial position of public corporations, thereby reducing their existing high debt stock. A strong public enterprise reform programme, including an automatic pricing system, unbundling of large entities and privatisation is essential to resolve the public sector debt issue.",

Both exports and imports declined sharply while tourism was badly affected. However, the external current account deficit narrowed as imports declined faster. The external capital account and financial account recorded surpluses. Reflecting these changes, the overall balance in the BOP registered a surplus following deficits recorded in the last two consecutive years, but it was well below the original target. Consequently, the external official reserves, as well as the total country reserves, increased, reversing their declining trend and reducing the pressure on the exchange rate. The exchange",

The slowdown was marked by a sharp weakening in USA, a moderate growth in the EU and a still fragile economy in Japan. The drop in demand in advanced countries, particularly in major export markets for developing countries, had adverse repercussions on international trade and the growth prospects of trade dependent developing countries including Sri Lanka. The impact of favourable international developments on the Sri Lankan economy, such as lower oil prices and the reduction in international interest rates, was more than offset by the adverse impact of sharp reductions in export demand, the drop in tourist arrivals and the decline in private capital inflows. The move to an independently floating exchange rate regime and entering into a Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF helped to ease the adverse impact of external developments.",

    "text": "The sharp drop in imports was mainly due to a slowdown in economic activity, low derived demand for intermediate imports from weak export demand, the surcharge imposed on imports and lower petroleum prices. The reduction in import value is a composite result of a 4 per cent drop in average import prices and an 11 per cent decline in volumes. The lower international prices for petroleum, textiles and some investment goods contributed to the reduction in average import price. Lower import volumes of food and consumer durables (sugar, wheat, milk products, motor vehicles, radios and television sets), intermediate goods (textiles, petroleum products, diamonds, chemicals and plastic) and investment goods (building materials and machinery) were the major reasons for a reduction in import volume. Thus, the decline was reflected in all three major import categories. The largest drop, 37.8 per cent, was in the investment category (24.9 per cent when adjusted for aircraft), while intermediate and consumer goods categories declined by 12.3 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively. The sharp drop in investment goods throughout the year was a major concern, as it retards the future economic growth prospects of the country. One of the favourable developments in international commodity prices was the drop in petroleum prices by about 15 per cent during the year, which alone saved about US dollars 125 million in Sri Lanka's import bill. The drop in consumer goods imports was partly due to the import surcharge imposed on non-essential consumer goods. The drop in motor vehicle imports was due to the suspension of the facility given to public servants and parliamentarians for the import of motor vehicles on concessionary terms.",

The economic slowdown, and the increase in interest rates to prevent pressure on the exchange rate under the previous crawling exchange band system, required the relaxation of monetary policy, while the prevailing inflationary trend and higher public sector borrowings required a tight monetary policy stance. While balancing these conflicting requirements, the emphasis of monetary policy was placed on promoting future price stability, and maintaining stability in the financial markets and assisting the domestic economy to face the severe internal and external difficulties encountered in 2001. Accordingly, the Central Bank cautiously reduced its key interest rates, which had been raised during the second half of 2000 and in January 2001, gradually but consistently. Provision of adequate liquidity was further supported by the reduction of the Statutory Reserve Requirements (SRR) and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka's (CBSL) purchases of foreign currency from the government and foreign exchange market, without adding pressure on the exchange rate. Consequently, the high rupee liquidity shortfall, which had continued from the previous year, declined sharply, reaching a balanced situation by end 2001. All market interest rates declined, but",

However, with the improving financial market stability, these rates were reduced on six occasions by 800 -900 basis points. A large part of this reduction was made during the' second half of the year following the developments in the financial market as well as on the inflationary front. The Bank Rate was also reduced from 25 per cent to 18 per cent to adjust it in line with the reductions in other market rates. CBSL reduced the SRR on commercial bank deposits by 1 percentage point to 10 per cent with the intention of increasing market rupee liquidity, which also increased the commercial banks' lending capacity. With this reduction it was also intended to reduce intermediation costs of the banking sector, thereby enabling banks to reduce their lending rates.",

The purchase of foreign exchange by commercial banks from the Central Bank, the settlement of foreign public debt and large borrowings by the public sector from the banking system had resulted in a liquidity shortfall of around Rs.30 billion towards the end of 2000 and this continued into early 2001. Commercial banks, in particular the two state banks, met the liquidity shortfall through the reverse repurchase window on a rollover basis. However, the injection of rupee liquidity by the Central Bank through the purchase of foreign currency from the market (US dollars 126 million, i.e., Rs. 11.3 billion) and the purchase of the dollar proceeds of the Sri Lanka Development Bonds (US dollars 158.5 million, i.e., Rs.14.3 billion) and privatisation proceeds (US dollars 90 million, i.e., Rs.8.1 billion) from the government, improved domestic market liquidity. The reduction of SRR too contributed to improving liquidity by reducing the required deposits of commercial banks with the CBSL by about Rs.3.7 billion. These liquidity injections, after offsetting the liquidity contractionary impact of foreign public debt repayments, increased market liquidity, turning the deficit into a surplus of about Rs.l billion by end 2001.",

Thus, the overall growth in broad money supply (M2b), as well as reserve money expansion, remained compatible with initial projections. However, the contributions of causal factors to monetary growth changed significantly. The realised increase in NFA of Rs.7 5 billion and private sector credit of Rs. 32.4 billion were significantly lower than the corresponding values envisaged under the monetary programme for 2001 i.e., Rs. 62.3 billion and Rs. 35.4 billion respectively, while the actual increase in public sector credit of Rs. 56.7 billion was much higher than the projected repayment of Rs. 22 billion.",

Meanwhile, a broader money supply (M4) based on the financial survey, which includes the operations of licensed specialised banks and finance companies, in addition to licensed commercial banks, grew by 13.6 per cent at end 2001 compared with 12.7 per cent at end 2000. Both reserve money expansion and an increased money multiplier (from 4.60 in 2000 to 4.88 in 2001) contributed to the monetary expansion in 2001. Reserve money expanded by Rs. 7.4 billion compared with a Rs.4.7 billion increase in 2000, reflecting the improvement in NFA of the Central Bank with the building up of external reserves, reversing the developments in the previous two years. Effectively, a further Rs.3.7 billion of high-powered money was made available to the market with the reduction in the SRR, which had previously been sterilised by the Central Bank. Meanwhile, the money multiplier rose, reflecting the impact of the reduction of SRR by 1 percentage point and the decline in the currency to deposit ratio reflecting the high opportunity",

    "text": "Despite large reductions in policy oriented interest rates and interbank interest rates, the slow and small adjustments in general lending rates with a continuation of relatively high interest rate spreads, reflect some of the rigidities characterising nominal market interest rates. First, the relatively high level of non-performing assets at around 17 per cent of the total portfolio, coupled with high non-operating costs imposed a stickiness to the downward adjustment of the banks' lending rates. Second, household preference for fixed rate deposits restricted the banks' flexibility to reduce interest rates in the short run reducing their adjustment speed. Third, persistent and large volumes of market borrowings required by the public sector, which are generally less interest sensitive, also prevented faster and large declines in lending rates. Furthermore, market expectations were less sensitive to announced fiscal consolidations and government borrowing targets, as actual public sector borrowings have been significantly higher than the original targets, creating pressure on interest rates. The Central Bank has been continuously reducing the SRR, placing more reliance on OMOs and reducing policy induced intermediation costs, in the composition of the interest rate spread. Furthermore, the Central Bank has started to publish information on interest rates, by institution and instrument with a view to promoting competition in the financial market.",

More attention was paid more to the reforms in education, tax administration, closing down of redundant public sector institutions and an adjustment in prices and charges of the products and services provided by public corporations. In view of the losses and the high debt burden of CPC, the local prices of petroleum products were raised in April 2001, with increases in diesel, kerosene and furnace oil prices, even though kerosene and diesel prices were reduced towards the end of 2001 following the declining crude oil prices. The long overdue automatic petroleum pricing formula was introduced at end 2001, preventing ad hoc price changes and accumulation of losses, allowing a passthrough of changes in petroleum import prices more regularly to the domestic market. However, the full impact of petroleum price changes cannot be realised until transport fares are allowed to reflect the market cost, enabling passthrough of the impact. CEB imposed a fuel adjustment charge of 25 per cent in March 2001, although this falls short of what is adequate to cover the increasing cost. Measures taken to reform the two state banks by reconstituting their Boards of Directors with experienced private sector members and the recruitment of new, experienced staff to key management positions are already showing favourable results. The government has closed down 28 out of 35 identified public sector institutions listed in Budget 2001. Furthermore, privatisation of the National Insurance Corporation by selling a 51 per cent share and the transfer of the Prima Flour Mill agreement to a build-operate-own (BOO) status from a build-operate-transfer (BOT) status by selling the government ownership, improved investor confidence and provided resources for deficit financing.

Global economic growth, which declined sharply in 2001, is expected to recover during the second half of 2002 and improve further in 2003. Aggressive macroeconomic policy responses by major industrial economies, in particular the United States, including several rounds of interest rate cuts and fiscal stimulus measures, appear to have arrested the slowdown, as consumer and business confidence improved and uncertainties eased somewhat towards the end of 2001. The increasing signs of the bottoming out of the global slowdown is reflected in many leading indicators in most industrial countries and emerging market economies. Industrial production in most advanced economies has reflected a turn-around while international trade flows have improved. The information technology sector appears to have leveled off indicating prospects of a turn-around in the immediate future. The latter, in particular, is expected to stimulate economic activity in emerging market economies in East Asia which depend heavily on the information technology sector. The signs of economic recovery are also reflected in the financial markets with reduced risk spreads in both mature and emerging markets. The expected stabilisation of oil prices at the current levels would also provide ample support for a gradual recovery in the global economy.",

While advanced economies are expected to grow by 1.7 per cent, developing countries are estimated to grow by 4.3 per cent reflecting a marginal increase over the 4 per cent growth registered in 2001. The economic recovery in industrial countries is \u2022expected to be led by a strong upturn in the United States stemming from the exhaustion of inventories, increase in domestic demand and the fiscal stimulation introduced in 2001. According to the latest forecasts, the US economy is expected to expand by 2.3 per cent in 2002 and 3.4 per cent in 2003. Meanwhile, economic growth in the EU is also projected to improve from 1.5 per cent in 2002 to 2.9 per cent in 2003 while the economic contraction in Japan (-1.0 per cent) is expected to turn around to a positive growth rate of 0.8 per cent in 2003. Thus, most of Sri Lanka's major export markets are expected to improve towards the second half of 2002, strengthening further in 2003.",

External debt service, as a ratio of current receipts including private transfers is estimated to decline to 11.0 per cent in 2002 from 12.9 per cent in 2001, benefiting from increasing external earnings as well as low international interest rates. The floating exchange rate regime would safeguard the country's external competitiveness while enabling the Central Bank to build up external reserves as expected under the present stabilisation programme. Given the moderation in inflation and improvement in external assets, the pressure on the exchange rate is expected to be moderate. The expansion in forward market activities would minimise excessive fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate, particularly when settling large import bills in a thin market.",

Thus, domestic financing of the fiscal deficit is targetted to decrease by Rs.35.6 billion, higher than the reduction targetted in the overall fiscal deficit (Rs.16.8 billion) because of the expected increases in foreign financing by Rs.6.4 billion and privatisation proceeds by Rs. 12.4 billion in 2002. The Budget also announced plans to contain the borrowings of public corporations from the banking system and address their fundamental weaknesses. However, it is important to note that the government domestic borrowing would pre\u00adempt almost all the resources available in the domestic non-bank sector in 2002. Therefore, a strict budget monitoring mechanism should be in place to avoid any deviation from the announced fiscal targets in order to identify any potential deviations and take necessary corrective measures early.",

However, on balance, monetary policy would need to remain tight at least until fiscal consolidation starts to take effect and inflationary pressures abate further. This is necessary to prevent the present cost-push inflation turning into a demand fuelled inflation. Therefore, the policy interest rates, which were reduced by about 800 - 900 basis points in six adjustments made since February 2001, have to be decided cautiously. Once the public sector adjustments take effect with improved market rupee liquidity and downward adjustment in inflationary expectations, the Central Bank would be able to reduce its interest rates (i.e. Repo and Reverse Repo rates) gradually, but over the year. However, there is a large space in general lending rates to adjust downward, as they have not been reduced to reflect the full impact of reductions in policy interest rates and taxes.",

Given the expected reduction in the public sector domestic credit demand, monetary expansion is projected to come from the improvement in net foreign assets of the banking system and expected private sector credit demand. Out of the projected increase in money supply of Rs.69 billion, Rs.59 billion (i.e., 86 per cent) is expected from an increase in NFA while only Rs.10 billion is expected from an increase in net domestic assets (NDA). The projected increase in the NDA is low due to the expected reduction in public sector credit in the banking sector by Rs.34 billion consisting of Rs.29 billion from the government and Rs. 5 billion from public corporations. These estimates would permit accommodating private sector credit expansion of about Rs.46 billion in 2002, compared with the realised increase of Rs.32 billion in 2001. Thus, given the projected increase in NFA, the increase in private sector credit demand expected along with economic recovery could be accommodated, avoiding pressure on prices only if the public sector could adhere to its borrowing targets. Therefore, the realisation of fiscal targets envisaged in the 2002 Budget and expected improvements in the financial position of public corporations are critical to achieving these monetary targets and expected downward adjustments in inflationary expectations and hence interest rates.",

    "text": "There are several advantages that an SBA offers over other facilities. Financial assistance provided under SBA allows member countries to correct their temporary balance of payments imbalances without having to resort to trade and payments restrictions. It assists in building up market confidence, locally and internationally, through an increased build up of reserves. Having adequate reserves is important as it helps the member country to meet unexpected increases in demand for imports and encourages private foreign capital inflows. Unlike other loans from bilateral and multilateral donors, where the parties must go through a time consuming negotiation process, under the SBA, the eligible amount, or a part of it is disbursed immediately upon obtaining Board approval from the IMF. Therefore, it has a very quick impact on the member country. Unlike other multilateral and bilateral loans, which are lent to the government, SBA funds are lent to the central banks of the countries. Hence, it does not affect the domestic money supply of the country. A further advantage is that undertaking an IMF supported programme acts as a catalyst to generate additional financial assistance from other sources such as official and private creditors.",

    "text": "The present SBA programme for Sri Lanka was approved by the IMF Board on 20 April 2001. As on previous occasions, the Government decided to use the Stand By facililios of the IMF at this lime, because of a decline in external reserves arising from a sharp increase in payments for oil imports and unanticipated increases in budget expenditure. The IMF's stamp of appro\\al at the time was crucial in softening the negative impact on the country flowing from the altitude of the international community to the ethnic conflict, and in getting the support of the international community to face the expected global economic slowdown in 2001. Under this arrangement, the country was granted a 14 month credit facility of SDR 200 million (approximately l.'S dollars 250 million') (48.4 per cent of the country's IMF quota) to support Ihe government's economic adjustment programme fur 2001-2002. Sri Lanka drew SDR 103.4 million (equivalent to 25 per cent of the country's IMF quota) on 21 April 2001. The remaining SDR 96.6 million was to be disbursed in four equal tranches of SDR 24.1 million each on 30 August 2001. 30 November 2001, 28 February 2002, and 15 May 2002 after the completion of scheduled reviews. The facility was subject to an interest rate equivalent to the SDR rate, which stood at 4.38 per cent per annum al the time of the disbursement of the first tranche. The loan was payable in 5 years and the Government of Sri Lanka could settle the loan earlier if the country's external position improved faster than expected. The second and third tranches were not drawn, as the reviews required prior to disbursement could not be completed due to internal and external difficulties facing ihe country. The reviews arc expected to be completed before March 2002.",

The present investment, at around 22 - 24 per cent of GDP, is not sufficient to generate a growth rate over 5 per cent in the medium term. Therefore, investment has to be increased to about 30 per cent of GDP in the medium-term to raise the growth rate to over 6 per cent. On the investment front, public investment has to play a catalytic role by selecting investments having a crowding-in effect on private investment instead of selecting crowding-out investment. In a developing country like Sri Lanka, public investment in infrastructure development would have a crowding-in impact on private investment raising the overall investment of the country, as private investment responds positively to the availability of infrastructure facilities.",

Therefore, it is essential to turn around the present current account deficit (i.e., government dissavings) to a surplus (i.e., government savings) in order to generate sufficient national savings in the medium- term as indicated in the medium term scenario. Similarly, the government has to reduce the overall fiscal deficit to about 3 - 4 per cent of GDP from the present high level of over 8 per cent in the medium-term in order to ensure availability of domestic financial resources to meet increasing private sector investment.

Furthermore, the country's performance was even overtaken by a number of other Asian developing countries, which started economic reforms much later, largely owing to weak policy adjustments and slow economic reforms. Consequently, major economic problems such as slow growth and low productivity, coupled with inadequate savings and investment, persistent high inflation, unemployment, under-employment and poverty, serious macroeconomic imbalances and vulnerability to external shocks not only still continue to remain, but have been aggravated in some instances, posing greater challenges to macroeconomic management. There is no doubt that some factors, which are beyond the country's control, may also have contributed to such developments; but that should not be an excuse for weak performance. In fact, such factors should be taken as challenges for prudent macroeconomic management by pursuing timely and adequate remedial measures to minimise their repercussions. Given the fast changing global events and the potential for rapid growth following peace, managing the inevitable change with least cost to the economy and social life would be an uphill task for policy makers in the short to medium term. This would require changes not only on the economic front but also in cultural, social and attitudinal areas.",

Basic economic principles explain that economic growth could be accelerated by improving efficiency in resource allocation, particularly in the short run, by moving towards the boundary of the production possibility frontier, i.e., the line indicating the various combinations of the maximum possible production of different goods and services for a given set of inputs and technology. Similarly, these principles indicate that achieving a sustainable high growth over the medium-term depends on the ability to shift the production possibility frontier outward (i.e., an expansion of the production capacity in the economy) through factor accumulation and/or technological improvements. Therefore, it is essential to undertake policy adjustments and reforms helpful in improving resource allocation efficiency, as well as augmenting the availability of inputs and improving technology.",

Meanwhile, improving resource allocation efficiency, minimising wastage in the production process and improving technology are the major avenues available for raising productivity in the economy.

Thus, improvement of efficiency in the Colombo Port is crucial for strengthening its regional competitiveness as well as supporting development in the country's external trade. Given the limitation for capacity expansion in the Colombo Port, and the proximity of Hambantota to one of the most busy sea transport routes in the Indian Ocean, the development of the proposed Hambantota Port would provide strong impetus to the expansion of port services in the country.

Despite the continuation of various assistance schemes provided by successive governments since independence, the growth in the agricultural sector has remained low reducing its relative share in GDP. Similarly, agricultural productivity has remained low, resulting in a high average cost of production in comparison with some other developing countries. Consequently, there has been growing concern in recent years about the constraints on growth of the country on account of the high vulnerability of agricultural output to the vagaries of the weather, as well as the stagnation, in some cases even decline, of sectoral output. Policy inconsistencies with ad hoc tariff and non-tariff changes, non-availability of high yielding seed varieties in adequate quantities and in time, greater dependence on traditional cultivation practices without shifting to modern high-tech cultivation methods, weaknesses in marketing systems and high post-harvest losses are some of factors that have affected the poor performance of the sector.",

In the absence of proper price signals, farmers' decisions to cultivate any crop may depend on less efficient criteria such as administered prices rather than demand and supply, leading obviously to an inefficient resource allocation. Furthermore, the existence of fragmented and non-competitive markets prevents discovery of appropriate prices for farmers' products. Therefore, the development of forward markets, derivative products and commodity exchanges, and dissemination of market information regularly would ensure the discovery of competitive prices for agricultural products and minimise excessive price fluctuations. The lack of such marketing facilities at the rural level results in distress sales, particularly by small and marginal farmers. Such low prices have a direct bearing on their ability to invest in agriculture and hence, on the yield.",

It is generally accepted that high inflation is not conducive to realising sustainable high growth as it wastes valuable productive resources for inflation hedging activities and discourages productive investment due to increasing uncertainties and unfavorable speculative activities. Similarly, at the operational level, there is a recognition that the growth-inflation trade-off curve has a nonlinear segment i.e, inflation at some low level has positive effects on growth by 'greasing the wheel' of the economy, but there is a point beyond which inflation can be harmful to growth. The turning point in this tradeoff curve varies among countries, as well as for a particular country over different time periods, depending on other macroeconomic factors. Therefore, it is not easy to find such as inflationary turning point exactly for any country, but it is estimated to be around 4-5 per cent for most developing countries, according to some empirical studies.",

As continuation of high public sector borrowings is the major causal factor for monetary expansion in Sri Lanka, a significant reduction in the public sector deficit is essential to facilitate monetary management in achieving its price stability objective. However, monetary policy alone cannot contain inflation, particularly in the short run. In the short run, price changes result not only by changes in aggregate demand caused by monetary policy stimuli, but also cost push factors and temporary supply shortages, as well as changes in inflationary expectations. Similarly, wage determination practices have a significant impact on inflation determination, as wage increases higher than productivity increases create inflationary pressures. Therefore, while monetary policy places more emphasis on promoting price stability, taking measures to increase domestic factor productivity and relating wage increases to productivity increases would be helpful in containing inflation. Strengthening policy credibility and reducing the presently high inflation on a consistant basis would encourage the downward adjustment in inflationary expectation which is critical to achieving price stability on a sustainable basis.",

Furthermore, potential employment creation could be further accelerated by encouraging labour intensive industries and the production process. However, the potential to create employment of given investment and/or economic growth varies according to the existing incentive and disincentive structure for labour intensity in the economy. It is unfortunate that most existing labour laws, regulations and practices are biased against labour intensification in production. As it is difficult to restructure industries by reducing employment under the present labour laws, even when an industry faces severe difficulties due to reasons beyond the employer's control, investors prefer to select less labour intensive production processes. Similarly, delays in labour dispute settlements, often caused by politically motivated mushrooming unions, result in difficulties in negotiating labour issues. The non-availability of a confidential voting system for major labour union decisions such as strikes, and the violent behaviour of unions in sometimes even damaging property and threatening lives of the management discourage investment in labour intensive investment. Similarly, recruitment to the public sector on an ad hoc basis and the availability non-performance based benefits in the public sector also discourage labour intensive private industries through high threshold wage levels for the unemployed in the waiting queue. Corrective measures to resolve these hindrances against labour intensive investment are critical in resolving unemployment through creation of more employment opportunities. In this context, the recent decision to expedite settlement of labour disputes, define clear guidelines for compensation payments, rationalise public sector cardre, introduce a contributory pension scheme for new public sector employees and expand income tax coverage to civil service incomes excluding their salaries, are useful measures in the right direction.",

All tax concessions and waivers need to be discontinued as soon as possible in order to safeguard an adequate tax base. Improvement of tax administration is essential to realise revenue targets. Similarly, regular adjustments in charges for government services, at least to cover their market cost, are essential. On the expenditure side, emphasis has to be placed on containing growth-retarding expenditure levels as well as improving the quality of expenditure. All subsidy schemes should be targeted only to provide benefits to the genuinely deserving segments of the population. All current transfer payments to public sector enterprises, which have revenue sources, should be phased out, requiring them to adhere to at least a balanced budget (operational) principle. A civil service reform programme has to be implemented to contain the increasing wage bill and pension payments as well as to improve the efficiency of public service. In deficit financing, every effort must be made to mobilise targeted foreign financing and privatisation proceeds. In domestic financing, all resources have to be mobilised through market oriented instruments rather than placing the burden on captive type sources, such as EPF, ETF and insurance companies, which have already been burdened by financial repression due to the strategy in deficit financing implemented during the last few decades. Debt management has to be improved, not only by considering the",

Even strong adjustments, which lower the overall fiscal deficit to about 4 per cent of GDP, in the medium-term, could lead to a rising debt/GDP ratio if at least 2 per cent annual GDP growth is not maintained. Therefore, implementation of growth enhancing structural reforms is equally important in achieving medium-term fiscal sustainability. Thus, both strong fiscal consolidation efforts and measures and growth accelerating structural reforms are the key to rapid growth.

Most of the existing regulations governing sectors such as telecommunications, transportation, insurance, banking, trade and energy etc., have been either partly removed or relaxed to promote competition. However, it has been increasingly recognised that some of the existing regulations are not effective, not appropriate at all or not appropriate in ihe current form to the present domestic and global economic environments, increase the cost of setting up and carrying on any businesses or industries and hinder investment flows and economic growth. Therefore, ii is necessary to evaluate critically the effectiveness, and cosis and benefits of the existing regulations to identify ihe regulations that need to he either repealed or reformed to make them effective and less costly. In this regard, a De-Regulation Committee was set up on 19 January 2001 under the lndustiial Promotion Act No. 46 of 1990 to study and promote de\u00adregulation w-uh a view to improving the country's competitive position lo attract investment, especially in competition with several deregulated countries such as Dubai.

The work programme has generated several important findings. Some of the important findings are as follows: Countries like Singapore. Hong Kong. Dubai and Mauritius perform very well with much less regulation. Outdated regulations and rigid administrative procedures imposed by public sector institutions raise costs and discourage dynamism in trade and industry. The time and monetary costs for firms to comply with Sri Lanka's regulatory system on average raise costs by 9 per cent and reduce profits by 30 per cent. Poorly operating land and labour markets are two of the biggest barriers to investment and income generation in Sri Lanka. Besides land and labour market regulations, other causes of unnecessarily high compliance costs are tax-related regulations, customs regulations, banking and financial regulations and environmental regulations. In the case of electricity, restrictions on entry and ad hoc supplementary intervention by the government have resulted in large budget transfers, shortages and limited incentives for further private investment. The tea sector faces compulsory levies for research and development and promotion activities.",

Being one of the earliest sectors in which relaxation of controls was instituted, the financial sector benefited from the liberalisation policies and has expanded steadily over the last 20 - 25 years. Deregulation has led to sector expansion, with both foreign and domestic investors entering the field (as highlighted in the Box article 'Reforms for Financial Stability and Efficiency' in Part I of Annual Report 2000). Currently, the financial sector accounts for about 8 per cent of GDP. while the sector's annual average growth rate in the last ten years has been 7.2 per cent.

It is a regulator, an advisor, a market developer and a market player; roles that can sometimes be in conflict. If the Central Bank is to discharge its responsibilities effectively, it has also to evolve with the financial market and accept changes in its role. Over the past half a century and more, changes have certainly occurred in the operations of the Bank. However, there is perhaps greater need for reform in the current context of rapid globalisation and changing needs of the financial sector. Conscious of this need, the Central Bank has commenced internal reforms to modernise itself. Some of these measures were highlighted in the article 'Modernisation of the Bank' in Part II of Annual Report 2000 and are further detailed in the Box article",

The other, most prominent of these non-core activities are managing the public debt, implementing exchange control regulations and managing the funds of the Employees' Provident Fund.
