The increase in the assets of the Bank was reflected in increases in the foreign financial assets (by Rs.43.2 billion) and sundry assets (by Rs. 5.0 billion). However, local financial assets of the Bank decreased by Rs.1.9 billion This is due to the combined effect of a drop in Treasury bills and bonds (reverse repurchase agreements) by Rs 28.5 billion, and an increase in the holding of Treasury bills and bonds by 22.4 billion. Further, government's foreign loans and guarantees also decreased by Rs.1.9 billion.",

    "text": "Foreign financial assets comprised the largest category of assets, accounting for 54 per cent of total assets of the Bank, and recorded an increase of 38.2 per cent in 2001 compared with the level in the previous year. The increase was partly due to the receipt of the first tranche of the Stand By Arrangement (SBA) facility of the IMF (SDR 103.35 or Rs. 11.8 billion), net purchases of US dollars by CBSL from the local foreign exchange market to build up external reserves (US dollars 127.0 million or Rs. 11.8 billion), receipt of foreign loans raised by the government (US dollars 100.0 million, or Rs.9.3 billion), receipt of foreign exchange against the Sri Lanka Development Bonds (issued by the Central Bank on behalf of the Government (US dollars 158.0 million or Rs. 14.8 billion) and the receipt of the privatization proceeds (Air Lanka US dollars 25.0 million and Prima US dollars 65.0 million, equivalent to Rs. 8.4 billion). The increase in foreign financial assets in rupee terms was partly due to the increase in the rupee value arising from the depreciation of the rupee against major currencies during the year. The value of the Bank's trading securities (foreign financial assets) increased by 38.9 per cent due to an increase",

Thus, the share of the income from local financial operations in total income increased from 18 per cent in 2000 to 41 per cent in 2001. This was mainly due to an increase in Treasury bill holdings of the Bank from Rs.37.0 billion in 2000 to Rs.59.5 billion in 2001, and relatively higher rates of interest that prevailed during the first half of 2001. The increase in Treasury bill holdings of the Bank took place during the second quarter of the year, particularly in the months of May and June 2001. Another reason for the increase in domestic income was the provision of a large amount of funds to the market by way of reverse repurchase facilities on an overnight basis at high rates, with 23 per cent p.a. being the maximum.",

The Bank is in the process of re-evaluating its retirement benefit policies and schemes and the impact on such schemes brought about by the Voluntary Retirement Scheme which became effective from 1 January 2002. However, provision has been made for pension liabilities based on an Actuarial Valuation carried out by Actuarial Management Consultants (Pvt.) Limited - a correspondent firm of Watson Wyatt Worldwide as at 31 December 1999 for the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Pension Scheme. The valuation is effective for a period of three years from the date of valuation. Provision has also been made for Gratuity Liabilities and other employee benefits as of 31 December 2001. The Board intends to obtain a comprehensive actuarial valuation for all pension schemes during the financial year 2002. The Financial Statements for the year 2001, which partially conform to IAS, have been approved by the Monetary Board of the Bank.",

The contribution by LCBs and PDs to the total outright sales stood at Rs. 8.6 billion, recording an increase of Rs 2.3 billion (48 per cent of the total increase). Similarly, a total of Rs. 11.7 billion worth of Treasury bills were bought by CBSL's internally managed funds, an increase of Rs. 2.4 billion compared to 2000. The main contributory factor for this development, particularly with regard to LCBs and PDs, was the declining trend in Treasury bill yield rates at the primary market towards the latter part of the year, which enabled Pis to secure a better yield at the CBSL's secondary window. The CBSL's decision in 2000 to physically deliver the Treasury bills to the respective buying parties, providing an opportunity to use them for trading in the market, also made Treasury bills at the CBSL's secondary window more attractive to LCBs and PDs. The monthly volumes of outright sales of Treasury bills at the secondary window of CBSL in 2000 and 2001 are shown in Chart - 1 .",

The preference of some participating institutions to repo-out their Treasury bills rather than selling outright to the CBSL to meet their long-term liquidity shortages, and declining yields in the Treasury bill primary market, which yielded capital losses if sold outright, were the reasons for the drop in the volume of outright purchases of Treasury bills by the CBSL during the year under review.",

The BSD has adopted a new approach - risk resource matching, for on-site examinations. Accordingly, the degree of a bank's exposure to varied banking risks such as credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and operational risks is measured, and resources available are evaluated to ascertain whether the bank could contain such risks to a minimum level. Capital, earnings and management quality are considered as key resources available for risk mitigation. In addition, banks' compliance with statutory requirements, applicable laws and regulations, internal controls as well as other prudential requirements are also examined. During the year under review, the BSD commenced on-site examination of 10 LCBs and 5 LSBs.",

Ltd. through the United States government in September, 1998 by issuing a Fixed Rate Promissory Note to provide funds for the Project. The objectives of the Project were to promote the private sector participation in environmental development, particularly in the urban and semi-urban areas, providing credit to Local Government Authorities (LAs), NGOs and interested individuals for the implementation of garbage disposal, water supply and sanitation, waste water treatment, drainage systems and other environmental development projects, to ensure the development of health conditions of people living in those areas and to improve the environmental conditions. The role of the Central Bank was to implement the credit programme through the PCIs namely; the six (6) Regional Development Banks, NDB and SANASA Development Bank, by granting refinance in respect of loans extended by those lending institutions. The Project was an experiment carried out by the government to test the possibility of using a market rate based private sector loan to fund the private infrastructure development activities. The credit facilities were mostly used by individuals and communities. 82 per cent of the loan funds i.e. Rs.221.8 million was granted for providing loans for obtaining tap water and sanitation facilities, and the balance was for financing the construction of drainage systems, community water supply schemes, building pavements, kitchen development and drinking water systems, improvement of fertiliser (compost) projects and the purchase of tractors and trailers by municipal councils for waste disposal.",

Currently, the value added estimates of the small business sector in the national income and product accounts are made on the basis of an indirect estimation procedure, as the economic activities in the small business sector are not covered by any standard reporting system.

The system is also used to identify the impact of changes in the administered prices of consumer items as well as to monitor inputs for agriculture in major producing areas. The sub sectors covered by the scheme include paddy, tea, rubber and coconut cultivation, and also small-scale construction. Data collection is accomplished through an islandwide network of school teachers who function as statistical investigators in around 100 centres. Information thus collected is published regularly through the print and electronic media. Seminars were conducted in Matara, Colombo, Anuradhapura and Kandy in 2001, to provide further training for the data collectors in order to improve the quality, efficiency and timeliness of their data collection, as well as to obtain their input on the reasons for differences in price developments across regions identified in the computation of regional consumer price indices.",

The survey was undertaken on a decision made at a national level meeting on economic issues convened by the Ministry of Finance and Planning and held in late 2000. The main objectives of conducting this survey were to, (i) identify methods to improve the quality of data on the \"other agriculture\" sector with a view to strengthening the existing data base on national income and (ii) to review the reliability of currently available statistics on subsidiary food crops and animal husbandry. The analysis of the survey data, as stated in the report, confirmed the high variability of agricultural production in this sector and, in this context, concluded that the currently available official estimates are reliable. The report also made recommendations to improve the present methods of data collection towards obtaining more precise estimates of agricultural production in this sector.",

A comprehensive computer network was set up, commissioning a PC network in addition to the AS/400 terminal network. The bank reconciliation system that was previously performed manually was computerised by electronically obtaining the daily statements from banks. The initial work to set up a web site for EPF has been completed, and is to be launched at the beginning of 2002. The improvements to the system enabled EPF to continue with issuing half-yearly statements to members, prompt updating of accounts, providing more detailed statements of payments by employers to the Commissioner of Labour for enforcement purposes, conducting better treasury management and prompt repayment of benefits to members.",

Hitherto, Sri Lankans who had proceeded abroad for employment or to set up a business or in a profession and Sri Lankan citizens who had made their permanent place of abode outside Sri Lanka, who are considered as non residents for Exchange Control purposes, were not permitted to make certain investments, such as those in government securities and debentures. Under this special scheme, a special bank account titled Rupee Accounts for Non Resident Investment (RANSI), which could be held on an interest bearing basis, was introduced. Funds remitted to RANSI accounts by Non Resident Sri Lankans, such funds could be used to make investment in any financial and real assets (except bearer Certificates of Deposit), without being subject to any Exchange Control restriction. Payment for such investments had to be made by a bank draft purchased out of the funds in a RANSI account. All income from investments made through RANSI accounts, such as interest, dividends, profits and rental income, could be credited back to the RANSI account.

Further, in order to ensure compliance with the regulations, it was also necessary to put in place a scheme to detect any foreign exchange transactions which could be connected to terrorist activities.

The expanded PD system is expected to lower the borrowing cost of the government through greater competition. Accordingly in 2001, the Monetary Board decided, in principle, to permit LCBs to be appointed as PDs. Under the proposed new system, there will be two categories of PDs, namely, separate primary dealer companies and LCBs. An LCB that is appointed as a PD will be required to create and maintain a special reserve, known as the Primary Dealer Special Reserve (PDSR), to be used exclusively for investing the obligations arising from its PD activities. The minimum amount of the PDSR has been determined to be Rs.150 million, comprising at least two thirds of Tier 1 capital1 and the balance upto one third of Tier 2 capital2. An LCB will also be required to conduct its PD business in a separate unit, headed by a manager holding a senior management position and maintain separate books of accounts in respect of its PD activities.
