Census-2001 provides critically important information on demographic factors for planners and policy makers after a lapse of 20 years, since the last census was conducted in 1981. The total population, as estimated by Census-2001, was 18.7 million persons and the average annual growth rate of population was 1.2 per cent for the 20-year period from 1981 to 2001. The higher population growth rates in certain districts, relative to the overall rate, signify changes in the regional distribution of the population arising from economic and social developments in the country during this 20-year period. Further, ageing of the population, as well as a further decline in the gender ratio, were evident from Census-2001 results. The outcome of Census-2001 emphasises the need for development policies that will address high economic disparities among regions. In addition, the social security needs of the elderly will become an increasing burden on the state unless adequate reforms that address these issues are undertaken soon.",

    "text": "In 2001, the labour market in Sri Lanka was affected by the negative growth that resulted from a host of external and domestic shocks, contracting demand for labour in nearly all sectors. In the absence of second and fourth quarter data for 2001 from the Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) conducted by the DCS, on the basis of first and third quarter data for 2001, the unemployment rate, which had shown a declining trend since 1990, rose, albeit marginally, to 7.8 per cent in 2001 from 7.6 per cent in 2000. This comparison does not take account of seasonality. The comparison implies a contraction in overall employment generation, where the private sector was the major contributor to employment. The setbacks to the economy may have an adverse lagged effect on investment due to excessively rigid labour laws existing in the country. The Termination of Employment of Workmen Act No.45 of 1971 prevented enterprises from restructuring by reducing their workforce despite the contraction in their activities during 2001. Hence, enterprises had to bear the entire cost of maintaining the excess labour, thereby reducing their productivity and discouraging future investment in labour intensive industries. The long-felt need to review existing labour legislation supporting achievement",

The long-run effect of the fall in the labour force participation rate would be a slower expansion in potential economic growth, since labour is an important factor of production in the country.

Third, information was collected on Sri Lankans who are permanent residents of the country but were temporarily living abroad at the time of the Census.

The percentage share of population less than 18 years fell from 41.6 per cent in 1981 to 32.9 per cent in 2001. Correspondingly, the percentage share of those aged 18 years and over increased from 58.4 per cent in 1981 to 67.1 per cent in 2001. The ageing of population is one of the major socio-economic issues associated with the current demographic structure and it is a trend that requires urgent attention. Unlike in most developed countries, Sri Lanka's ageing problem has some unique characteristics. It is the result of an unusually fast demographic transition for a developing country, caused by high life expectancy and decreasing birth rates. However, Sri Lanka has attained this status with a very low level of per capita income. The latter itself will create a serious resource constraint on the government budget in allocating funds necessary for providing social security for the aged population in the country in the future and hence, emphasises the need for greater private sector participation in areas such as health insurance and private pension funds. The problem of ageing will also have a direct impact on the level of labour supply as measured by labour force participation rates.",

The increase in employment was 18,000 in 2001 compared to 41,000 in 2000, reflecting a lower capacity utilisation and investment.",

    "text": "Reflecting the impact of declining investment and' contraction in the economy on labour demand, the unemployment rate rose marginally to 7.8 per cent in the third quarter of 2001 compared to 7.6 per cent in 2000. The Termination of Employment of Workmen Act, No.45 of 1971 (TEWA) prevents private firms with 15 or more employees laying off workers for non-disciplinary reasons without the prior written consent of the Commissioner of Labour or the employee concerned. Consequently, although many enterprises were compelled to downsize their activities due to lack of demand, employees were advised to stay at home on payment of their minimum monthly salary, excluding allowances, in order to minimise costs and avoid closure of businesses. In the hotel sector, although it was expected that laying-off of workers would rise to about 40,000 after the terrorist attacks, the TEWA prevented such laying off. Accordingly, the forced maintenance of employment levels prevented a clear reflection of the economic slowdown on employment reduction in the affected sectors.",

The problem of unemployed educated youth, both graduates and non-graduates, remains critical due to a skills mismatch, which restricts their opportunities to secure employment in the private sector or abroad. This mismatch between the human resource needs of the private sector and the qualifications of the graduates produced by the state-run universities indicates the necessity for reforms in the university education system. In order to address this mismatch, career guidance units were set up in several universities with the assistance of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce. In addition, institutes such as the Tharuna Aruna Institute (TAI), which is a joint venture between four major chambers of commerce and the government, obtained the assistance of the relevant chambers to provide placements to graduates in the private sector. Under the programme, training was provided for 16 months to selected graduates with an option to absorb them to the permanent cadre, subject to the availability of vacancies and performance.",

According to the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE), the registered number of departures for foreign employment increased to around 184,000 during 2001 compared to 181,000 in 2000 and exceeded the projected target of 183,750 for 2001, due to timely interventions and the efforts of all stakeholders in minimising the adverse impact of the external shocks.",

The greater confidence placed on licensed agencies by migrant workers mainly reflected the impact of improvements in regularisation and supervision of employment agencies by the SLBFE. The share of licensed agencies placed out of Colombo rose from 35 per cent in 2000 to 38 per cent at end 2001 and may have directly contributed to improving access to licensed agencies by potential job seekers.",

Hence, it is important that consideration be given under the government's proposed youth training schemes to equip the educated youth with such competence to target these new markets for foreign employment in the future.",
