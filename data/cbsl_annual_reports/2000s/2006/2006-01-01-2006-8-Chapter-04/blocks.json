On thesupply side, the expansion in domestic agriculture productionwith paddy recording a bumper harvest for the secondconsecutive year helped ease the price pressure at thebeginning of the year, but the weather related disturbancesto harvesting and distribution particularly of vegetables andsubsidiary food crops during the second half of the yearresulted in higher prices. The escalation of the cost ofproduction and distribution, mainly due to the upward revisionof fuel prices on several occasions from the second quarterof the year continued to exert pressure on prices. Thoughincreases in fuel prices raised the price level, its overall impacton the future inflation will be to lower the inflation, since thegovernment will be able to reduce the subsidy cost, which ismostly met through inflationary financing. The tariff increaseson some imported consumer items to encourage domesticproduction, also raised the cost of imports, contributing toconsumer price inflation during the year.",

In addition, prices tend to rise during the festiveseasons, particularly during the two main cultural and religiousfestivals in April and December.

The slower increase was due to differences in theweight structures used for the construction of four regionalCPIs for the districts of Anuradhapura (APCPI), Colombo(CDCPI), Matale (MLCPI) and Matara (MRCPI) and thevariations in regional prices. All these four regional indicesregistered lower annual average increases ranging from 7.7per cent to 9.4 per cent, with the lowest increase of 7.7 percent being recorded by the MRCPI. The relatively high weightsof the food sub group in the APCPI and MLCPI around 64per cent compared to around 58 per cent in the CDCPI,contributed to raise the inflation in Anuradhapura and Mataledistricts higher than Colombo as inflation mainly stemmedfrom the food items. Prices of vegetables in the Anuradhapuraand Matale districts increased rapidly in the fourth quarter of2006 compared to the increases in the Colombo district inresponse to the extreme weather conditions making asignificant influence on the registered inflation in these twodistricts. This may be due to the high sensitivity of prices tosupply changes in the producing areas compared to Colomboas Colombo receives supplies from everywhere being themain distribution centre in the country.",

Factors that affected the pricesat the retail level during the year had a similar impact on thedomestic and import food prices at the wholesale level aswell. In addition, higher prices of certain key exports such astea and pepper in the international market contributed to theincrease in this sub index. Meanwhile, price declines in afew items including paddy and coconut, which account formore than 20 per cent of the overall weight helped dampenthe price pressure to a certain extent. The increase in thepetroleum sub index, having the second highest weight, by27 per cent, was a consequence of the upward revisions indomestic fuel prices. Increase in the miscellaneous sub indexby 33 per cent during the year, mainly influenced by higherinternational prices of rubber driven by increased demand,had a substantial impact on the index. Increase in the pricesof tyres and batteries, consequential on higher imported input",

Excise duty imposed on tobacco, high fuelprices, high export prices for rubber, increased tyre pricesand high import price of wheat grain contributed to theincrease in intermediate goods prices.

Theinvestment sub group recorded the highest annual averageincrease of 30 per cent, which, however has a relatively lowershare. The continuous demand for both domestic andimported construction materials with further expansion oftsunami construction work along with implementation offoreign funded projects exerted demand side pressure oninvestment goods. The higher transport charges of buildingmaterials contributed partly to this increase, in addition tothe higher cost of domestic production arising from high importprices as well as domestically procured goods and services.Further, the restrictions imposed due to environmentalconcerns adversely affected the production of certainconstruction materials such as sand, bricks and roof tileslimiting their supplies.",

However, incontrast, the total man-days lost and workers involvedrecorded the highest level in the year 2006 due to theengagement of a large number of plantation workers inindustrial action during 2006. Trade union action in theplantation sector in the 4th quarter of 2006 had a grave impacton the plantation industry. The total man-days lost in theplantation sector implied that the plantation sector as well asthe export trade would continue to suffer until production andquality returns to normal. The number of strikes in the rest ofthe private sector, excluding the plantation sector alsodeclined in 2006. Reflecting this, the total man-days lost andworkers involved declined dramatically by more than 50 percent in this category. This favourable development was acombined result of various factors such as signing thecollective agreements between employers and trade unions,better relationships among parties and maintaining a bettersocial dialogue at the workplace to improve industrialharmony.

A part of the high volatility experienced during recenttimes was mainly due to the supply side factors arising fromsignificant structural problems associated with the productionand distribution systems. Improvements in the handling anddistribution systems particularly for agriculture products alongwith a system to preserve some agriculture commoditiesduring glut periods, could help mitigate high volatility in prices.Further, avoiding ad hoc tariff revisions to encourage a smoothflow of imports and encouraging the processed food industryare other measures in addressing price volatility.",
