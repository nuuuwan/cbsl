PRICES, WAGES ANDEMPLOYMENT

The year 2006 commencedwith a moderation ofconsumer price inflation, inresponse to tight monetarypolicy aided by growth indomestic production. However,the developments that tookplace thereafter, particularly, theescalation of oil prices, led to areversal of this trend exertingpressure on inflation during theremainder of the year. The rise inprices was a consequence of thecombined effects of demandpressure, increases inadministered prices and supplyside disturbances. The pressureon prices from the demand sidewas directed from the relativelyhigh monetary growth, that arosefrom high public and private sectorcredit due to increasedconsumption, as well as increasedgovernment expenditure andborrowings.

PRICES, WAGES AND EMPLOYMENT

A further demand side pressure arose from the wageincreases of the public sector employees in 2006. On thesupply side, the expansion in domestic agriculture productionwith paddy recording a bumper harvest for the secondconsecutive year helped ease the price pressure at thebeginning of the year, but the weather related disturbancesto harvesting and distribution particularly of vegetables andsubsidiary food crops during the second half of the yearresulted in higher prices. The escalation of the cost ofproduction and distribution, mainly due to the upward revisionof fuel prices on several occasions from the second quarterof the year continued to exert pressure on prices. Thoughincreases in fuel prices raised the price level, its overall impacton the future inflation will be to lower the inflation, since thegovernment will be able to reduce the subsidy cost, which ismostly met through inflationary financing. The tariff increaseson some imported consumer items to encourage domesticproduction, also raised the cost of imports, contributing toconsumer price inflation during the year.

Public sector real wages increased while private sectorreal wages contracted during 2006. The overall nominalwages of central government employees rose by 30.5 percent resulting in a 15.1 per cent increase in real terms. Thereal wage was maintained with the grant of Cost of LivingAllowance (COLA) to public sector employees by thegovernment with effect from 01 January, 2006.

The rate of unemployment dropped substantially to 6.5per cent during 2006. This was mainly reflected in theincreased employment in the agriculture and constructionsectors and the increased incidence of self employment. Thegovernment efforts to provide more job opportunities for theyouth also supported the drop in unemployment. However,foreign employment placements dropped in 2006 in responseto the political uncertainty in the Middle Eastern Region.

4.2 Prices

Factors of Price Movements

The sharp increase in the general price level in 2006 overthe price level of 2005 was a result of the combination ofboth demand pull and cost push factors. The rising inflationwas reflected in the annual average increase recorded by allprice indices in 2006, with the CCPI and SLCPI rising by13.7 per cent and 9.5 per cent, respectively.

The demand side pressure emanated from the increasein the reserve money at a higher rate due to the monetaryexpansion as well as high government expenditure andborrowings. This was indicated by the rising trend of coreinflation , which is the part of overall inflation more sensitiveto monetary expansion1.

The monetary growth continued to remain high by theend of the year at around 17.8 per cent. The high monetarygrowth has been entirely due to the increases in net domesticassets from the banking sector as a result of high expansionof credit to both the private sector and the government. Theprivate sector credit continued to grow at a higher rate andreached 24.8 per cent in December, 2006 due to expansionof economic activities relating to trading, real estate andhousing, leasing and consumption. The increase inprovisional advances to the government contributed to theexcessive monetary expansion, which has fuelled the demanddriven inflation. This indicates the need for renewed effortsin improving demand management.

Prices of domestically produced and imported food itemsreflected supply side disturbances. Prices of vegetablesincreased substantially during the latter part of the year dueto the shortage in supply, being the inter harvest periodexacerbated by the extreme weather conditions. Thedisturbances created for distribution of goods due to adverse

security developments in the Northern and Eastern provincesraised the prices of fresh fish both at wholesale and retaillevel even though the fisheries sector had almost fullyrecovered after the tsunami. Resulting from the substitutioneffect of high fish prices, the prices of meat, eggs and driedfish also increased. The prices of several other key food itemssuch as red onions, potatoes and dried chillies rose noticeablydue to both supply side and external factors. Increase inintermediate input costs along with the high transportexpenditure were other contributory factors for the above pricedevelopments.

High international prices coupled with the duty revisionsand the currency depreciation raised the prices ofimported items. International oil prices increased by around22 per cent to US dollars 64 per barrel compared with USdollars 53 per barrel in 2005 compelling the revisions ofdomestic fuel prices. World prices of sugar rose sharply in2006 due to low supply in the international market as a resultof sugar cane being used to produce ethanol, a substitute for

gasoline, in response to high international petroleum prices.High import price of wheat grain raised the local prices ofwheat flour and bread. The government imposed an additionalcustoms duty of Rs. 10 per kilogram on imported wheat flourand increased the customs duty on imported rice from Rs. 9to Rs 20 per kilogram with effect from 01 February 2006,which raised the import prices of essential goods. This wasfurther aggravated by the upward revision of the Ports andAirport Development Levy (PAL) and the excise duty oncertain non-food items from the 2007 Budget by the end ofthe year. Furthermore, the increased freight and insurancecharges too added to the cost of imports in 2006.

A series of administrative price revisions impacted onraising the price levels in 2006. This contributed to a furtherrise in the overall price level of both domestically producedand imported goods. Significant price revisions were madeon fuel, electricity, transport, liquor and tobacco. Theadjustment of domestic fuel prices three times during the yearresulted in petrol and auto diesel prices rising by 15 per cent

and 20 per cent, respectively during 2006. The fuel pricerevisions were necessary to remove the burden of subsidiesfrom the government to avoid longer term inflation resultingfrom the weakening of the fiscal sector.

Seasonal Variations in Prices

Consumer prices in Sri Lanka exhibit distinct seasonalpatterns, which are clearly reflected in the movementsof the CPIs. There are two main agricultural seasons Yala(April-August) and Maha (September-March) coinciding withthe two monsoons leading to seasonality in agriculturalproduce such as rice, vegetables, pulses and other subsidiaryfood crops. Accordingly, during the two main harvestingseasons, which fall in February to March and July to Augustperiods, the prices decline while during inter harvest periodsthe prices creep up as seen by the CPI movements, ingeneral. In addition, prices tend to rise during the festiveseasons, particularly during the two main cultural and religiousfestivals in April and December. This behaviour of prices wasseen in 2006 as well where vegetable prices dropped withina range of 1 - 43 per cent during harvesting periods while theprices rose in a range of 1 - 52 per cent during inter harvestperiods. Similarly, in respect of rice, the prices declined in arange of 3 - 8 per cent while increases ranged between 1 -10per cent in the respective periods.

Consumer Price Indices

The Colombo Consumers’ Price Index (CCPI), the officialcost of living index, recorded a 19.3 per cent increase onpoint-to-point basis in December 2006 culminating in anannual average increase of 13.7 per cent by the year end.

Among the sub indices of the CCPI, the food sub index, whichhas the highest weight of around 62 per cent in the totalbasket, had the dominant influence on the overall index. Thefuel and light sub index increased at a faster rate in 2006 asa result of the upward price revisions of kerosene andelectricity during the year coupled with the price increases offirewood due to bad weather conditions. The increase of themiscellaneous sub index was mainly driven by the upwardprice revisions of transport related goods and services andprice increases of liquor, tobacco, medicine and education.

The Sri Lanka Consumers’ Price Index (SLCPI) which hasa broader geographical coverage with a more recentconsumption basket (base year 1995/97) followed asimilar trend registering a point-to-point increase of 17.9per cent and an annual average increase of 9.5 per centin December 2006. The dominating consumption expendituregroup of SLCPI, food, beverages and tobacco with a weightof 71.2 per cent increased by 17.7 per cent on a point-to-point basis in December, 2006 and made the highestcontribution to the overall increase. Housing, water, electricity,gas and other fuel category which has the second highestweight in the SLCPI basket, recorded its highest increase,contributing significantly to the increase in the overall index.Housing construction materials, LP gas, electricity chargesand kerosene recorded price increases. The transport subindex also recorded a relatively higher increase in responseto the price revision of bus fare by the Ceylon TransportCommission and the upward price revision of petrol anddiesel. Meanwhile, pressure from other sub indices were lowercontributing less than 5 per cent to the overall increase in 2006.

All regional CPIs also demonstrated a behaviour similarto the CCPI and SLCPI, but with slower increases thanthe CCPI. The slower increase was due to differences in theweight structures used for the construction of four regionalCPIs for the districts of Anuradhapura (APCPI), Colombo(CDCPI), Matale (MLCPI) and Matara (MRCPI) and thevariations in regional prices. All these four regional indicesregistered lower annual average increases ranging from 7.7per cent to 9.4 per cent, with the lowest increase of 7.7 percent being recorded by the MRCPI. The relatively high weightsof the food sub group in the APCPI and MLCPI around 64per cent compared to around 58 per cent in the CDCPI,contributed to raise the inflation in Anuradhapura and Mataledistricts higher than Colombo as inflation mainly stemmedfrom the food items. Prices of vegetables in the Anuradhapuraand Matale districts increased rapidly in the fourth quarter of2006 compared to the increases in the Colombo district inresponse to the extreme weather conditions making asignificant influence on the registered inflation in these twodistricts. This may be due to the high sensitivity of prices tosupply changes in the producing areas compared to Colomboas Colombo receives supplies from everywhere being themain distribution centre in the country.

Wholesale Price Index

The Wholesale Price Index (WPI), which measures theprice movements at the primary market level, behavedsimilarly to the CPIs, particularly the SLCPI, precedingthe price developments at the retail level. The movementsin WPI mostly represent the price developments at producerlevel and therefore, it is a useful indicator to assess the futureinflation in the country. The WPI was on a decelerating pathin 2005, and rose continuously after January 2006 markinga point to point increase of 17.3 per cent by December toyield an annual average inflation of 11.7 per cent for the year.

The annual average change of the dominant sub groupof food, with a share of around 68 per cent, dominatedthe pattern of the overall index, but increased at arelatively lower rate in 2006. Factors that affected the pricesat the retail level during the year had a similar impact on thedomestic and import food prices at the wholesale level aswell. In addition, higher prices of certain key exports such astea and pepper in the international market contributed to theincrease in this sub index. Meanwhile, price declines in afew items including paddy and coconut, which account formore than 20 per cent of the overall weight helped dampenthe price pressure to a certain extent. The increase in thepetroleum sub index, having the second highest weight, by27 per cent, was a consequence of the upward revisions indomestic fuel prices. Increase in the miscellaneous sub indexby 33 per cent during the year, mainly influenced by higherinternational prices of rubber driven by increased demand,had a substantial impact on the index. Increase in the pricesof tyres and batteries, consequential on higher imported input

prices and freight charges was evident in the annual averageincrease in the transport equipment sub index by 19 per centand the impact of higher excise duty on alcoholic drinks in2006 was reflected in the increase of the alcoholic drinkssub index by 11 per cent. In contrast, the drop in the wholesaleprice of fertilizer as a result of granting subsidy helped lowerthe high price pressure to a certain extent.

On the basis of origin of goods, the imports sub grouprecorded the highest increase followed by the domesticgroup, while the exports increased at a relatively lowerlevel during the year. The higher international prices of majorintermediate import items of petroleum products and key foodimports and medicine were the main contributory factors tothe increase in the imports sub index, which has a weight ofaround 27 per cent in the WPI basket. The domestic grouprepresenting a share greater than 50 per cent, increased byaround 11 per cent, influenced by the price increases of bothfood and non-food items such as alcohol, tobacco, tyres andconstruction materials. The exports sub group whichincreased at a slower rate than 2005 was mainly influencedby the lower prices of coconut and cocoa.

Of the three sub indices consumer, intermediate andinvestment, under the end use classification,intermediate goods was the main contributor to the risein price levels. This group increased at a higher rate of 25per cent on average, compared to 11 per cent increase inthe previous year. Excise duty imposed on tobacco, high fuelprices, high export prices for rubber, increased tyre pricesand high import price of wheat grain contributed to theincrease in intermediate goods prices. The consumer subgroup with a dominant share of more than 71 per cent, mainlycontaining food items moved very much similar to the foodsub index, recording a similar increase for the year. Theinvestment sub group recorded the highest annual averageincrease of 30 per cent, which, however has a relatively lowershare. The continuous demand for both domestic andimported construction materials with further expansion oftsunami construction work along with implementation offoreign funded projects exerted demand side pressure oninvestment goods. The higher transport charges of buildingmaterials contributed partly to this increase, in addition tothe higher cost of domestic production arising from high importprices as well as domestically procured goods and services.Further, the restrictions imposed due to environmentalconcerns adversely affected the production of certainconstruction materials such as sand, bricks and roof tileslimiting their supplies.

GDP Deflator

The GDP deflator, which measures the price change ofall goods produced in the economy, increased by 10.3per cent compared with 9.9 per cent in 2005. Theincreasing trend of inflation was observed in the industry andservices sectors, while the agriculture sector increased at a

lower rate of 7.7 per cent as compared with the increase of11 per cent registered in the previous year. The servicessector recorded the highest increase of 11.1 per cent whilethe industry sector increased by 10.3 per cent in 2006compared to 9.0 per cent in 2005.

4.3 Wages

The employed population comprises paid employees,employers, own account workers and unpaid familyworkers. The paid employees category comprises of threesectors public sector, formal private sector and informalprivate sector. Wages in the public sector are largelydetermined by the government. For formal private sectoremployees, the wage setting mechanism includes severalforms, tripartite determination, collective bargaining,remunerative tribunals, unilateral employer decisions andadjustment by government directives. In the informal privatesector, wages are mostly determined on demand and supplyconditions in the market. In 2006, overall nominal wages grewfaster than the previous year.

Public Sector Wages2

The government implemented a new salary structure forthe public service by re-categorising /re-grouping of allposts/services based on a new set of definitions underBudget proposals of 2006. Accordingly, all governmentemployees initially received a fifty per cent of the salaryincrease which was based on the difference between thenew salary scales and the salaries paid in December, 2005inclusive of all allowances, with effect from 01 January, 2006.The balance fifty per cent of the difference was due to bepaid from January 2007.

A new system for the payment of cost of living allowances(COLA) to the government employees was alsoimplemented as proposed in the Budget 2006. Accordingly,the COLA would be revised every six months ending 30thJune and 31st December of each year. An initial payment ofCOLA amounting to Rs.1,000/- was granted to all governmentemployees with effect from 01 January 2006 (PublicAdministration Circular No.12/2006) and was increased toRs.1,375/- from 01 July 2006. The combined impact of aboveincreases was the rise in the nominal wage rate indices of allcategories of public sector employees, non-executive officers,minor employees and government school teachers, in therange of 26 - 31 per cent in 2006. When these nominal wageincreases were adjusted for inflation, their real wagesincreased in the range of 12 - 16 per cent.

Formal Private Sector Wages3

Commerce rose by a range of 1-3 per cent, while those forthe services sector remained unchanged. The wage increasesin the formal private sector were influenced by the wageincreases of individual contracts, collective agreements,unilateral decisions by employers and minimum wagedecisions of Wages Boards. Employees in this sector sufferedlosses in their minimum real wages in 2006 too asexperienced in 2005. However, as the minimum wage indicesdo not cover all payments and wages earned by managerialand professional categories, the actual situation could bedifferent to the situation reflected in the minimum wageindices.

Informal Private Sector Wages4

The informal private sector experienced marginalimprovements in wage rates in 2006. The Country WideData Collection System (CWDCS) of the Central Bankshowed that the nominal daily wages in the agriculture sectorincreased in a range of 8 – 13 per cent in 2006 and the wagesof the workers in the tea and rubber sectors rose at relativelyhigher rates as a result of improved prices of tea and rubberduring the year. However, real wages of all agricultural sectorworkers dropped further within a range of 0.3 - 5.4 per centcompared with the drop of 6.6 -12.9 per cent in the previousyear. The construction sector nominal wages increased withina range of 12 - 13 per cent as the demand for constructionworkers continued to rise in 2006. However, when adjustedfor inflation, their real wages dropped marginally during theyear.

4.4 Population, Labour Force and Employment

Population

The mid year population, estimated at 19.9 million in 2006,grew by 1.1 per cent over 2005. All three age categories(below 15 years, 15-54 years and 55 years and above)recorded growth rates similar to the mid year populationgrowth . All districts contributed to the expansion in population,except Jaffna and Killinochchi which recorded declines dueto out-migration. High increases in population in Colombo,Vavuniya, Kandy, Gampaha, Ratnapura, Kurunegala, Badullaand Galle districts contributed 63 per cent to the overallgrowth.

Labour Force

The labour force, employment and unemployment in thecountry are estimated by the Quarterly Labour ForceSurveys (QLFS) conducted by the Department of Censusand Statistics (DCS)5. However, the DCS did not conductQLFS in 2005 due to the absence of a sample frame in thetsunami affected areas, but a Special Labour Force Survey(SLFS) was conducted in August 2005 covering the entirecountry. The QLFS was conducted in 2006, but the Northernand Eastern provinces were not covered due to the adversesecurity situation in those areas. Therefore, in the absenceof a comparative data series for 2005 and 2006, QLFS dataof 2006 and SLFS data adjusted for exclusion of the Northernand Eastern provinces are used for this analysis as the mostclosely approximates. Accordingly, the labour force increased

Employment

According to the QLFS, the number of employed personsincreased by 4.7 per cent to 7.1 million in 2006 from 6.8million in August 2005. The QLFS defines an employedperson as one who worked for pay, profit or family gain(unpaid) for one hour or more during the week preceding thesurvey. Employees temporarily absent from work due toillness, bad weather or labour disputes are also consideredas employed.

The increase in employment was spread across all threeeconomic sectors, agriculture, industry and services. Theindustry sector had recorded the largest increase whileexpansionary policies of the government including severalsubsidy programmes coupled with favourable agriculturalprices contributed to the rise in employment in the agriculturesector. However, the employment in the services sectorcontracted marginally by 0.4 per cent although it recordedthe highest sectoral GDP growth during the reference period.

This was mainly due to the decline in employment in thepersonal services category from 1.3 million to 1.2 millionbetween the two periods.

According to the QLFS, the share of employment of theprivate sector declined from 46.2 per cent in August 2005to 42.1 per cent. The share of public sector employmentincreased from 13.2 per cent in August 2005 to 13.4 per centin 2006. The expansion in the public sector employmentduring the reference period was also reflected in the AnnualPublic Sector Employment Survey (APSES) conducted bythe Central Bank.

Unemployment

According to the DCS, the annual unemployment ratedropped to 6.5 per cent in 2006 from 7.2 per cent recordedin August 2005. However, the rate had dropped to 6.3 percent in the fourth quarter 2006 from 6.4 per cent in the thirdquarter.This decline was associated with the healthy growthexperienced in all three sectors of the economy during 2006.The implementation of several programmes for job creation,dissemination of labour market information and careerguidance programmes also contributed to lessen the rate ofunemployment.

The unemployment among young age groups andwomen was relatively higher. However, youthunemployment, especially among the age groups of15-19 years has declined significantly. According to theQLFS estimates, the unemployment rate in this agegroup had declined to 23.1 per cent in 2006 from 33.2per cent in August 2005, while the unemploymentamong the age group of 20-29 remained unchanged.

Further, the high unemployment rates among those withGCE/OL and GCE/AL and higher qualifications had declinedto 9.9 per cent and 11.6 per cent, from 10.6 per cent and12.2 per cent, respectively. However, these estimates excludethe Northern and the Eastern Provinces for both years asthe QLFS of 2006 was not conducted in these areas.

Foreign Employment

According to estimates of the Sri Lanka Bureau ofForeign Employment (SLBFE), 1.5 million Sri Lankanswere employed overseas as at end 2006. However, foreignemployment placements during the year 2006 declined by13 per cent to 201,143 compared with 231,290 in 2005. Thisdecline was mainly due to tension in the Middle Eastern

Region and poor supply of skilled labour and housemaids.The Middle Eastern Region contributed for more than 90 percent of total foreign employment opportunities. However, therewas a noticeable increase in employment opportunities inSouth Korea and Malaysia in recent years following the effortsof the government.

The share of males in foreign employment placementscontinue to increase. The share of male foreign employmentwhich was 25 per cent in the mid 1990s increased furtherfrom 41 per cent in 2005 to 44 per cent in 2006. This increasein the share of male foreign employment was due to highdemand for skilled and unskilled males for jobs in Qatar inthe last two years. Consequently, the share of females in

total foreign employment declined further from 59 per cent in2005 to 56 per cent in 2006.

Despite government initiatives to encourage skillsdevelopment for migrant labour, 70 per cent of migrantworkers were in the unskilled category, although theshare of housemaids, the most vulnerable and lowestincome-earning group dropped to 50 per cent in 2006from 54 per cent in 2005. There was a high concentrationon housemaids of the manpower categories especially in theMiddle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE,Qatar, Lebanon and Jordan with a combined share of morethan 80 per cent. In contrast, there was a higher concentrationof skilled migrant workers to Malaysia and South Korea. Thiswas a result of new government policy to encourage skilledlabour migration to those countries.

Labour Productivity

Labour productivity continued to improve in 2006,following the trend experienced during the last few years.In terms of value addition, it increased by around 3 per centcompared to the previous year, to Rs. 142,700 per employee,based on the employment numbers adjusted for the Northernand Eastern provinces for 2006 to be comparable betweenthe years. The considerable increase in productivity in theservices sector was the main contributor to the increase in

productivity in 2006 while the contribution from the industrysector was marginal. Meanwhile, the agriculture sectorproductivity, which has remained at low levels, had declinedcompared to 2005 dampening the overall productivity for theyear.

Labour Relations

The number of strikes in the private sector decreased in2006, to the lowest in the past decade. However, incontrast, the total man-days lost and workers involvedrecorded the highest level in the year 2006 due to theengagement of a large number of plantation workers inindustrial action during 2006. Trade union action in theplantation sector in the 4th quarter of 2006 had a grave impacton the plantation industry. The total man-days lost in theplantation sector implied that the plantation sector as well asthe export trade would continue to suffer until production andquality returns to normal. The number of strikes in the rest ofthe private sector, excluding the plantation sector alsodeclined in 2006. Reflecting this, the total man-days lost andworkers involved declined dramatically by more than 50 percent in this category. This favourable development was acombined result of various factors such as signing thecollective agreements between employers and trade unions,better relationships among parties and maintaining a bettersocial dialogue at the workplace to improve industrialharmony. The continuous maintenance of such a soundenvironment is essential for increasing investment andproductivity in the country.

Some disputes in certain key public sector institutionshave raised concerns over maintaining overall industrialharmony. In this respect, the workers’ unrest that prevailedin certain key public institutions such as Sri Lanka Railway,Ceylon Electricity Board, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority andCeylon Petroleum Corporation during the year need to beaddressed to create an environment conducive to promotinggrowth.

Labour Market Reforms

During 2006, the Ministry of Labour Relations and ForeignEmployment (MLRFE) passed the Employment ofWomen, Young Persons and Children (Amendment) Actin Parliament with amendments to restrain persons belowthe age of 18 years from being employed in hazardousoccupations. Previously, there were no provisions in the Actto cover persons less than 18 years of age in work classifiedunder hazardous work tantamount to the worst forms of childlabour use. In this respect, a competent committee appointedby the steering committee on elimination of child labourexamined the types of employment, which can be classifiedunder the worst forms of child labour.

The MLRFE also made amendments to the IndustrialDisputes Act (IDA) No.43 of 1950 and Termination ofEmployment of Workmen Act (TEWA) No.45 of 1971,extending the period to 6 months from 3 months for thesubmission of appeals after termination of employment,to the Commissioner of Labour under TEWA and to theLabour Tribunals under IDA. They also suggestedamendments to the Employees’ Provident Fund (SpecialProvision) Act No.6 of 1975. The Minister of Labour soughtapproval of the Cabinet to amend the law to provide for theCommissioner to grant permission for pension funds only ifin the opinion of the Commissioner they are more beneficialto the employees than the EPF and also to validate theoperation of approved provident funds and pension schemes,which were in existence as at 01 February, 1990. In thisrespect, the Cabinet approved the proposal and the LegalDraftsman was advised to draft amendments accordingly.Further, the MLRFE is considering repealing the FactoryOrdinance Act No.45 of 1942, as it does not cover workers inall sectors. Instead, a new Act, Occupational Safety, Healthand Welfare at Work Act has been proposed which will coverall the workers in all sectors.

The MLRFE commenced work relating to National Policyfor Decent Work (NPDW) in Sri Lanka. A TripartiteSteering Committee (TSC) was appointed under the

Minister’s chairmanship with the purpose of draftinga national policy and action plan. The NPDW in SriLanka identifies the weaknesses in the focus areas ofdecent work and sets out the policies designed toovercome them. The National Action Plan for Decent Workhas been developed with tripartite and regionalparticipation to convert policy into action. Under the NPDW,opportunity for work, rights at work, social protection, socialdialogue and the creation of jobs of acceptable quality arethe main areas concerned. Accordingly, the NPDW isintended to weave many strands of existing policy withdecent work principles to create an integrated frameworkfor social and economic development.

4.5 Policies and Issues

Rising high and volatile consumer price inflation needsto be addressed promptly. The money driven inflation isbeing addressed by the Central Bank through its monetarypolicy. A part of the high volatility experienced during recenttimes was mainly due to the supply side factors arising fromsignificant structural problems associated with the productionand distribution systems. Improvements in the handling anddistribution systems particularly for agriculture products alongwith a system to preserve some agriculture commoditiesduring glut periods, could help mitigate high volatility in prices.Further, avoiding ad hoc tariff revisions to encourage a smoothflow of imports and encouraging the processed food industryare other measures in addressing price volatility.

High dependency on fuel and lack of policies for itsefficient use have made domestic prices more vulnerableto international price fluctuations. A national levelprogramme for energy conservation needs to be implementedto harness the full potential of available sources of energy.

Using outdated indices to measure inflation tends to givepoor representation of general increase in prices.Developing a more representative measure of inflation andhaving it officially accepted by all stakeholders is also an areaof great importance for policy matters.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report 2006

Inflation is the change in aggregate price level.The process of measuring inflation involves combiningchanges in the prices of individual goods and servicesto derive a measure of general price change. Accuratemeasures of inflation is crucial in achieving pricestability, the goal of monetary policy.

It is unrealistic to monitor the price changes of allthe goods and services traded in an economy. Hence,inflation measures rely on a ‘basket of goods andservices’, which is a subset of goods and servicestransacted, consumed or produced in an economy. Priceindices used in Sri Lanka differ in terms of the goodsand services included in the basket, weights assigned toeach item, geographic area of price collection,population coverage and the base year.

In Sri Lanka, the Colombo Consumers’ Price Index(CCPI) is considered the official cost of living index.The other price indices are the Sri Lanka Consumers’Price Index (SLCPI), the Greater Colombo Consumers’Price Index (GCPI), the Colombo District ConsumerPrice Index (CDCPI), the Wholesale Price Index (WPI),the Western Province Consumer Price Index (WPCPI)and several regional price indices.

CCPI, the oldest index is based on the spendingpatterns of the lowest 40 per cent of households, wholived in the Colombo Municipal area in 1949/50, by theirmonthly expenditure. This index compiled and publishedby the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), whichis considered the official indicator of changes in cost ofliving as per the provisions of Wages Board Ordinanceof 1941, is used to determine the cost of livingallowances payable to government servants, plantationworkers and workers in other industries covered by thesaid legislation.

Sampling of the goods and services to be includedin a basket, so as to represent the aggregate pricechanges, is very important. It is equally important touse appropriate weights for each item so selected, whenderiving a price index. To ensure this, the items to bechosen for computing a consumer price index (CPI) aswell as the relative weights assigned to them need to bebased on findings of a contemporaneous survey onconsumption patterns of the targeted group. In thosegrounds, the official inflation measure of Sri Lanka isdisreputably outdated. The weights used in CCPI

Need for a Better Representative Measure of InflationBox 5

significantly differ from the findings of two recentsurveys, the Consumer Finances and Socio-EconomicSurvey (CFS) 2003/2004 conducted by the Central Bankof Sri Lanka and the Household Income and ExpenditureSurvey (HIES) 2005, conducted by the DCS. Table B5.1 compares the weights of major expenditure categoriesused in the CCPI, with the findings of CFS and HIES.

Reflecting the changes in expenditure patternssince 1952, the CCPI basket does not contain some ofthe current main expenditure items such as gas, watercharges, telephone charges, private tuition fees andmosquito coils. Food items are notably over-representedin the CCPI basket. It can also be observed that thegeographical coverage of CCPI is limited to the Colombomunicipal area. However, the other potential alternativewith a better geographical coverage, SLCPI too is notsufficiently representative to fill the vacuum as that indextoo largely over-represents food items.

The methodology behind the derivation ofinflation using CCPI implicitly assumes a fixedconsumption pattern, as well as the homogeneity of goodsand services over time, which are both far from reality,particularly in the long run. However, with thetechnological advancements, the quality of consumptiongoods changes over time. At the same time, new goodsand services constantly enter consumption bundles, whileold goods are dropped. Moreover, the quantity ofconsumption of each item also changes over time, withchanges in household income levels.

These issues are usually addressed in othercountries through periodic revisions of the items includedin the computation of the index and the relevant weights,based on contemporaneous survey findings. Thestatistical agencies that prepare CPIs usually haverevision schedules to rebase the weights of each item inrespective indices. In the US, the weights of CPI arerevised every other year, while the weights of CPI and

RPI in UK are revised annually. In most other countries,CPI weights are rebased at least once in 5 years. In SriLanka, a formal revision schedule has not been announcedfor the official index, but the Department of Census andStatistics has revised the weights from time to time, therecent major revision being in 1995.

Sri Lanka needs to follow international bestpractices as the official inflation measure in Sri Lanka isincreasingly becoming unrepresentative of the actual costof living of the country, as evident from the findings ofthe Consumer Finances and Socio-Economic Surveys.Meantime, none of the other available price indices aregood enough to replace the current official index.Therefore, it is high time to introduce a new price index,based on the findings of a contemporaneous consumersurvey and adopt it as the official measure of inflation.

PRICES, WAGES AND EMPLOYMENT

Continuation of upward adjustments in nominal wagesto compensate the negative effects of inflation hasresulted in increasing real wages without commensurateimprovements in the productivity, particularly in thepublic sector. This trend has also added pressure oninflation. Delaying such measures further could aggravatethe situation and also could spill over to the private sectorwage developments, eventually affecting the competitivenessof Sri Lanka’s exports in the international markets.

The incidence of high rates of unemployment among theeducated youth while some sectors of the economy aresuffering from the lack of skilled labour, highlights thedeficiencies in the education system. Though the needfor educational reforms accompanied by effective nationallevel programmes for skills developments to meet thechanging conditions in both the domestic and internationallabour markets have been widely discussed and agreed,

implementation of required programmes is lagging behind.This is manifested in some employers looking for opportunitiesto import high level human capital to meet their needs.

Remittances from expatriate Sri Lankans have beenproviding a significant relief to cushion the pressureon the external sector in Sri Lanka. However, Sri Lankastill caters mostly to the low demand for unskilled labourwith high concentration of unskilled employmentopportunities in the Middle East. Programmes to diversifythe supply of labour both among different job categoriesand different geographical areas will increase the potentialSri Lanka has in bringing more foreign exchange, whilesupporting programmes for regional development andpoverty reduction, as the majority of such job aspirants arestill from the rural poor. Furthermore, the financial systemneeds to innovate a mechanism to attract more remittanceinflows.
