The slower growth in this sub-sector wasmainly attributed to the decline in volume of apparel exportsto the US market due to increased competition from lowcost producing countries such as China, India, Vietnam,Bangladesh and Pakistan. However, this was partly offsetby higher growth in exports to the EU market benefiting fromthe duty free concessions received under the GSP+ scheme.The apparel exports to the EU market in 2006 grew by 17.3per cent. However, the full benefit of this scheme has notyet materialized due to difficulties in complying with the rigidROO criteria which require apparel products to containminimum 50 per cent of domestic value addition.
