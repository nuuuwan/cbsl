Sri Lanka’s economy grew

by an impressive7.4 per cent in real terms in2006, recording the highestgrowth since 1978 followed bya high growth rate of6 per cent in 2005. This growthwas commendable as it wasachieved in a challengingenvironment marked by highand volatile oil prices, recurringnatural disasters such as floodsand landslides, and renewedterrorism activities. The per capitaincome also rose toUS dollars 1,355 in 2006, fromUS dollars 1,197 in 2005. Theexpansion was broadbased, withall sectors of the economyregistering positive growth.The services sector achievedthe highest growth rate of8.3 per cent and contributed63 per cent to the overall growth.

This growth was underpinned by the healthy expansion intelecommunication,cargo handling and financial services.A recovery in tourism activities after the tsunami waswitnessed in the first half of the year, which faded as a resultof security concerns in the second half of the year. Theindustry sector grew by 7.2 per cent (8.3 per cent in 2005)and contributed 26 per cent to the overall growth. Thedeceleration in this sector was mainly due to lower growthin all the four sub-sectors (Mining and quarrying,Manufacturing, Electricity and water, and Construction)affected by increased costs of imports, raw materials andwages. The Agriculture sector grew by 4.7 per cent andcontributed 11 per cent to the economic growth. The positiveimpact of the recovery of the fisheries sub-sector from thetsunami was felt during the year. The agriculture sub sectoralso grew by marginally benefiting from favourable weatherconditions and fertiliser at subsidised prices. However, floodsand landslides occurred in some areas hamperingagricultural activities as well as transportation of the produce.

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at current market priceswas estimated at Rs. 2,802 billion in 2006, registering anominal growth of 18.4 per cent. This higher rate ofincrease was reflected by the higher real economic growthand higher increase in the price level, particularly in thesecond half of the year.

The GDP per capita for 2006 is estimated at Rs.140,894an increase of 17.1 per cent. In US dollar terms, per capitaGDP increased by 13.2 per cent from US dollars 1,197 in2005 to US dollars 1,355 in 2006.

The expansion in economic activity impacted positivelyon the labour market. The unemployment rate, which was7.3 per cent in 2005 dropped to 6.5 per cent in 2006.

The GDP deflator, which measures the price changesof all goods, produced in the economy, increased by10.3 per cent in 2006 compared with the rate of 9.9 percent in 2005. High price increases were recorded in most

sub-sectors except in mining and telecommunications,where prices were lower compared with the previous year.Higher fuel and material costs together with the depreciationof the Sri Lankan rupee during the year led to the increasein prices of most finished goods and services.

The higher expansion in the economy in 2006 wassupported by higher consumption and investmentdemand. Though exports grew moderately amidst sharpcompetition from low cost producing destinations, importsgrew at a higher rate of above 7 per cent.

The higher growth of private consumption was drivenmainly by higher disposable income in both thehousehold and the corporate sector on account ofhigher wages, higher commodity prices and higherprofitability of the corporate sector. Governmentconsumption grew by 30 per cent to meet increased salaries,pensions and rehabilitation expenditures includinghumanitarian needs following floods, landslides anddisplacements due to certain instances of tension in theeastern region.

The investment expenditure continued to increase at ahigher rate in 2006. Total investment as a ratio of GDProse from 26.5 to 28.7 per cent, mainly due to strongergrowth in private investment by 31.7 per cent. Governmentinvestment rose by 8.5 per cent. As a percentage of GDP,private investment rose to 24.8 from 22.3 while governmentinvestment declined to 3.8 per cent from 4.2 per cent in2005.

The Gross National Product (GNP) defined as GDPadjusted for net factor income from abroad (NFIA) grewby 7.0 per cent, a lower rate than GDP growth, The NFIAremained negative and deteriorated further by 31.1 per centin 2006. This is mainly due to higher outflows of debt servicepayments, and repatriation of profits and dividends.

Notwithstanding stronger consumption spending in2006, both domestic and national savings rose, asprivate domestic savings increased to Rs. 550 billion.The government dis-savings continued to fall as apercentage of GDP. Meanwhile, the higher increase in netimport of goods and non-factor services than investmentinflows resulted lower savings as a percentage of GDP in2006.

2.2Sectoral Policies, InstitutionalSupport and Issues

The high economic growth achieved and increasedinvestment were welcome developments in 2006. As thismomentum continues, the economy is projected to grow atover 8 per cent in the medium term. However, given the lowdomestic savings rate, the foreign inflows would be criticallyimportant to finance the high investment that shouldaccompany the projected high growth. Therefore, it is

imperative that the economic climate remains conducive toinvestment and investor confidence remains high. In thisregard, securing a sustainable peace to the Northern conflict,speedy implementation of required initiatives to encourageinvestment, prudent macroeconomic management includinggreater fiscal discipline, greater political stability, improvedinfrastructure facilities, particularly power and roads, will becrucial factors that enhances the future potential of theeconomy.

Agriculture

The government’s policy on agriculture emphasisesenhancing the income and living condition of farmersthrough increasing productivity and otherimprovements, while ensuring the food security in thecountry and availability of safe food products toconsumers. Accordingly, the Department of Agriculture

(DOA) was engaged in a series of activities includingagriculture research, improving extension services,increasing the production of high yielding seeds, productstandardization and certification, and plant protectionprogrammes during 2006. Priority was given to developpaddy varieties, suitable for drought prone areas and irontoxic soils and 7 such paddy varieties were released during2006. To provide quality seeds and planting materials, stepshave been taken to develop seed farms at Horana, SeethaEliya, Girandurukotte and Labuduwa and Maha IlluppallamaField Crop Research Institute. Steps have also been takento establish Dedicated Agricultural Product Zones.

The Budget 2007 proposed a policy package for furtherdevelopment of the agriculture. These policies includedremoving the duty waiver gradually on imported milk powder;promoting high value agriculture and processing activities;

implementing a comprehensive package providing credit andtax concessions for machinery, equipment and extensionservices for farmers engaged in such activities in agriculture,livestock, inland fisheries, prawn farming, fruit, vegetable,floriculture, seed development and production of organicfertiliser. To modernise rice flour processing, rice millers weregiven additional incentives including exemption from ValueAdded Tax (VAT) and import duties for importing machinerywhich are not manufactured locally. Nucleus farms areencouraged through tax and other incentives to develop fruitand vegetable cultivation based on the out grower system.Agricultural income including income from agriculturalprocessing and value addition was exempted from incometax to attract more investors.

Provision of fertiliser subsidy was expanded in 2006,which yielded both favourable and unfavourable results.Under the fertiliser subsidy scheme, paddy farmers who areregistered at the Agrarian Services Centres were eligible toobtain fertiliser at a subsidised rate of Rs. 350 per 50 kgbag. This was further extended to cover additional food cropssuch as chillies, maize, onion, big onion and vegetables,cultivated in paddy lands during the Yala season. Later,smallholders who own less than 5 acres of tea, rubber orcoconut land were also provided with a 50 kg bag of urea ata less subsidised rate of Rs. 1,200. Higher subsidies maylead to inefficient distribution of resources. Different subsidyschemes for different crops would lead to producerdissatisfaction and market distortion. In addition, subsidiesare involved with technology “lock-in” effect that may impedethe shift to less environmentally harmful policies, leading toincrease crop specification and reduce agro-biodiversity.Hence, a decrease in domestic support would favour thediversification of production, thereby improving agro-biodiversity.

The government took several measures aimed atestablishing sustainable and reasonable marketing andselling network to protect producers as well asconsumers. The Agricultural Products Marketing Authority(APMA) was established to enhance marketing and toensure a fair price for agricultural produce. In 2006, thegovernment allocated Rs. 3,387 million to purchase paddyat Rs. 16.50 - Rs. 17.50 per kilogram.

The government made tariff adjustments to protectcertain domestic agriculture produces. A specific duty ofRs. 9 per kg on rice imports was increased to Rs. 20 per kg,while customs duty on wheat flour imports was increasedfrom 2.5 per cent to 15 per cent or Rs. 4.50 per kg (whicheveris higher). Customs duty on wheat grain imports increasedfrom 2.5 per cent to 6 per cent. Customs duty on big onionimports increased from Rs. 10 per kg to Rs. 20 per kg and acess of Rs. 10 per kg was introduced on imported big onionsto ensure a fair price to local big onion producers.

Further incentives were given to enhance value additionin the plantation sector. Machinery and equipmentimported for the modernisation of tea, rubber and coconutprocessing factories were exempted from VAT and customsduties. The Economic Service Charge (ESC) applicable totea, rubber and coconut processing industries was alsoreduced from 0.5 per cent to 0.25 per cent in the Budgeteffective from January 2007. In order to offset the effort ofincreasing cost of energy, the government supportedinvestments on power and energy saving technology, withfinancial loan assistance from the Asian Development Bank(ADB).

Due to global over-supply of tea, priority was given forquality enhancing programmes. Low interest rate creditfacilities were arranged under the Tea Development Projectto modernise tea factories to obtain the Hazard AnalysisCritical Control Point (HACCP) certification. Consequently,about 34 out of 661 tea factories have obtained the HACCPcertification from Sri Lanka Standard Institute (SLSI) andother recognised institutions. To increase the production ofcut, tear and curl (CTC) and value added tea, the Sri LankaTea Board (SLTB) allowed additional CTC processing lineto be maintained without converting existing facilities in thefactory to meet the escalating demand.

The government aims to increase the extent undercoconut cultivation up to 1 million acres within a fewyears. Under this programme, in 2006, the governmentdistributed seedlings and fertiliser to the prospectiveplanters, free of charge. The required funds were allocatedthrough the cess fund. For the availability of seedlings forcoconut growers, 35 nurseries were maintained in variousareas and seedlings were sold at competitive prices.Coconut subsidy programme was revised in 2006 to attractmore growers. As a new approach, with the assistance ofstate and private sector organisations, coconut landsdamaged by the tsunami were rehabilitated and programmeswere launched to replant or new plant coconut in Samurdhirecipients’ lands and fragmentised lands. Incentives givenfor rainwater harvesting and plantation of “Gliricidia” incoconut lands also continued in 2006.

Several programmes were introduced to further developthe fisheries sector. In order to increase the capacity offishing in deep-sea, 55 multi-day fishing boats weredistributed while fingerlings were released to the reservoirtanks to promote fresh water breeding. To improve theinfrastructure of prawn farming in the Puttalam District, 14km length of highly silted canal at Mundalama North toPalaviya was rehabilitated. The ornamental fish exchangecentre was opened to promote and popularise self-employment and high value added exports throughornamental fish projects. Animal feed plant, which uses fishwaste, was established at the Beruwala fisheries harbour.Supply of prawns was exempted from VAT, while a cesswas imposed on the importation of prawns.

The government is taking measures to increase the localmilk production. At present, local milk production meetsonly about 20 per cent of the total demand and it is expectedto increase this level to 30 per cent by 2010. Actions weretaken to increase the productivity of domestic cattle andbuffalo herds, while expanding milk marketing. Theimportation of cattle, buffaloes and goats, semen and embryoto be used in livestock breeding was exempted from customsduty and VAT in 2006. A policy decision was taken to set upa Veterinary Investigation Centre per District to improveanimal health in the country and recruit 177 VeterinarySurgeons to the Department of Animal Production andHealth. The role of the public sector is to be limited toregulatory functions for animal disease management andquality assurance of inputs and outputs, while the privatesector is encouraged to undertake the raising of animals.

Sustainable agricultural growth can be achievedthrough focusing on policies on improving productivityand competitiveness. Agricultural research needs to befocused on improving agricultural productivity andformulating strategies to better manage natural resources.Encouraging demand-driven extension services, moreefficient use of farm inputs and a reduction of post-harvestlosses are necessary. More attention is required to discovernon-rival technologies, developing new hybrid seed varietiesand soil management technologies, rehabilitating small-scale irrigation tanks, promoting water managementmethods and decreasing salinity. The usage of low qualityseeds, improper management of pests and diseases andincorrect or inadequate use of fertilisers have caused thelower productivity of most agricultural products, particularlyvegetables.

Increasing private sector participation throughproviding better environment can minimise the burdenon the national budget. Under the paddy purchasingmechanism, the government has to purchase quality paddyoffered by the farmers at the government specified floorprice, irrespective of the market price. Funding these

purchases together with cost of storage and maintainingbuffer stocks is often problematic and exerts a heavy burdenon the national budget. Further, public sector interventionhas little or even negative impact on the welfare of thefarmers. Encouraging private sector involvement in paddymarketing, promoting farmers to enter into forward marketcontracts, facilitating to produce rice based products andpopularising them, and enhancing milling capacity toproduce super quality rice could help lessen the governmentintervention.

In the plantation sector, rising cost of production andshortage of labour are major concerns. Escalating energycosts (firewood, electricity etc.,), and increasing labour costswere major contributors for the significant increase of costof production. Improving productivity, crop diversification,inner plantation and investing on alternate sources of energywould help to lower the cost of production. Lack of trainedworkers particularly for tea and coconut plucking, rubbertapping and cinnamon peeling are severe constraints in theplantation sector. The tea smallholder sector, which accountsfor about 65 per cent of the total tea production, suffers froma lack of labour. The introduction of a productivity relatedwage structure would be a possible solution.

Given the healthy agro-climatic and investmentatmosphere, there is a vast potential for rapiddevelopment of both inland and ornamental fishingindustry. The country has natural resources in the form ofwater bodies and suitable land resources to breedornamental and inland fish varieties, but still these resourceshave not been channelled productively to obtain maximumresults due to some constraints. The lack of research anddevelopment (R & D), uninterrupted supply to meet demand,lack of technical know-how, inadequate stocking levels, lowsocial acceptance, lack of public awareness programmesand inadequate private partnerships could be majorcontributory factors for this situation.

Some difficulties in the marine fisheries sector hinderits potential growth. Inadequate application of fishingtechnologies, poor fisheries infrastructure, non-applicationof post-harvesting technologies, lack of knowledge on fishhandling and poor quality of fish landings have to beaddressed if the growth of the fishing industry is to beexpedited. Inadequate ice production and storage andtransport facilities have also constrained the efforts of valueaddition, quality improvement and efficient distribution of fish.Despite the government promoting deep-sea fishing theinflux of unplanned day-boats has led to depletion of fish inthe shallow waters.

Industry

The thrust of the long-term industrial policy of thegovernment is to develop a globally competitive,dynamic and technologically sophisticated industrialsector. Industrial policy, should encourage the innovation

and productivity improvement in processes and services. Inthis process, the foreign investment is expected to make avital contribution by providing capital, access to technologyand access to markets. To facilitate such process, thegovernment has initiated several measures aimed atstrengthening the legal and regulatory framework, providingnecessary infrastructure, improving corporate governance,enhancing quality and maintaining standards, improvingcompetitiveness of industries, facilitating access to creditand developing human capital.

The global market access of Sri Lankan exports wasexpanded further in 2006 with the continuousnegotiations at multilateral, regional and bilateral fora.The country, while adhering to the commitments given tothe World Trade Organization (WTO), engaged in bilateraltrade negotiations with India, Pakistan and other regionalcountries. Trade negotiations with India in 2006 was mainlyfocused on resolving the problems relating to quantitativerestrictions imposed by India for certain exports and furthernegotiation of a Comprehensive Economic PartnershipAgreement (CEPA). Negotiations with the European Union(EU) continued, aimed at rationalizing the stringent rules oforigin (ROO) criteria imposed under Generalised System ofPreference (GSP+) scheme, which requires Sri Lanka toadd at least 50 per cent value addition in case of apparelexports in order to qualify for such benefits.

The government reiterated its commitments to developsmall and medium scale enterprises (SMEs). DevelopingSMEs is considered to be the gateway to broad-basedindustrialisation and employment growth and is to bestrengthened by technology transfers through linkages withlarge scale and modern industrial enterprises. Further, SMEsare provided with incentives such as duty free imports,facilities for the payments in foreign currency for the supplyof raw materials and other inputs by local industries, andincentives for improving productivity and developingbackward linkages.

The government has taken several measures to promoteregional industrialisation. In 2006, 8 new industries wereestablished, 6 sick industries were revived and 3 industrieswere expanded while 8 existing industries were approvedto relocate outside the Colombo and Gampaha Districtsunder “Nipayum Sri Lanka” 300 enterprises programme.Incentives given for such industries include exemption fromincome tax for 5-10 years and exemption from duties andvalue added tax (VAT) for import of new plant andtechnologically advanced machinery. This is a majorchallenge undertaken to bridge the gap between incentivesgranted for Board of Investment (BOI) and non-BOI projects.Under the 300 enterprises programme, many concessionsgiven to BOI investors have been extended to local investorsas well. Further, factories which are relocated outside theWestern Province were provided with the incentive of

deducting the cost of relocation of industries, from theirtaxable income.

The Budget 2007 provided measures to further developdomestic industry. The on-going debt restructuringprogramme in textile firms is expected to continue on a risksharing basis between the government and the banks.Special attention has been placed on the establishment oftextile processing zones to develop backward linkages inthe apparel industry. Further, the Budget 2007 has alsoproposed the establishment of a nanotechnology instituteunder the supervision of the National Research Council. Thisis expected to improve the competitiveness of severalindustries, textile, rubber, electronic, and mineral.

The high tariff on electricity and industrial fuel isbecoming a serious problem in maintaining internationalcompetitiveness of many energy intensive industries.To alleviate this problem, the Budget 2007 proposed anexemption of heavy fuel oil, furnace oil and electricity fromVAT.

Institutional support continued in 2006 for the industrialsector development. Export and Enterprises DevelopmentForum facilitated by the Sri Lanka Export DevelopmentBoard resolved operational and other problems relating tothe exporters and entrepreneurs in 2006, while InvestorFacilitation Forum (IFF) under BOI helped investors toeliminate the existing bottlenecks faced by industrialists inacquiring land and obtaining environmental clearance, andother approvals from the central and local governments. Thespecial programme initiated by the Ministry of IndustrialDevelopment in 2004 helped to enhance competitivenessof targeted thrust industries of textile and apparel, footwear,leather products, ceramics, rubber, and wood and woodbased industries in 2006. It provided the necessary financialassistance for skill development, technical support for foodprocessing industry, quality assessment and issuance ofquality certificates in collaboration with United NationsIndustrial Development Organisation (UNIDO), Sri LankaStandards Institution and Industrial Technology Institute.

The industrial sector is facing several impediments inachieving a higher growth. Rising energy cost has becomeburdensome for high energy consuming industries such asceramics, cement and glass. Supply of reliable andaffordable energy to the industrial sector is extremelyimportant to achieve a higher industrial growth. In addition,there is an urgent need for resolving the issue of inadequateinfrastructure, rising cost of labour and raw material, lack ofskilled labour, lack of technically qualified personnel in theconstruction industry, rigid regulations in the labour marketand the inefficiencies in the public sector enterprises.

Further diversification of the industrial sector isessential to strengthen the resilience of the sector.Factory industry in Sri Lanka is highly dependent on a few

categories of industries such as apparel, rubber basedproducts and ceramic products. Hence diversification isessential to withstand external shocks.

Some of the existing producers in the country arealleged to increase business transaction costs and slowdown the decision making process of firms. The rigidand complex procedures lead to corruption, delays andwaste of resources. Registering new businesses andproperties, dealing with licenses, labour regulations, anddocument handling in export and import procedures are themajor areas need to be improved further. Industrial sectoralso find difficulties by the high litigation costs due to longdelays in court proceedings, complexity of existing laws andlimited capacity of the judiciary in commercial law matters.

Services

Faster implementation of the proposed infrastructuredevelopments projects is an essential requirement forrapid expansion of the economy. Major developmentprojects such as Colombo south harbour, coal and hydropower projects, express highways and railways need to beimplemented without delays as they are essential for rapidand sustainable development of the economy. Given thefiscal constraint, public and private partnership should beencouraged in funding for such projects.

Operational efficiency of public enterprises providinginfrastructure services, such as Ceylon ElectricityBoard, Sri Lanka Railways and Sri Lanka TransportBoard should be improved to reduce high cost ofoperation and relieve the burden on the governmentbudget. Introducing of institutional improvements,strengthening financial management, eliminating waste,introducing innovative products and other relevant measureswould help to improve the financial position of theseinstitutions.

2.3 Output

Agriculture

The Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing sector recoveredsignificantly and recorded a healthy growth of 4.7 percent in value added terms in 2006. The share of the

agriculture sector of total GDP was 16.8 per cent. The recordpaddy harvest in 2006, considerable increase in rubber andcoconut production and the strong recovery in fish productioncontributed to this growth. However, marginal decline in teaproduction, slowing down of poultry sector growth and dropin production of fruits and vegetables mainly due to extremeweather fluctuations diminished the potential growth in thesector.

Export Agriculture

Tea production declined marginally in 2006. Revision ofthe fertiliser subsidy scheme, extreme weather fluctuationsand labour unrest during the latter part of the year contributedto decline in annual tea production by 2 per cent to 311million kg, which is however still well above the average ofthe past five years production.

weather conditions, ample application of fertiliser and highprices led to this achievement. The paddy output in2005/06 Maha season increased by 6.1 per cent, while theoutput in Yala season declined by 2.2 per cent. The Yaladecline resulted from the delay in monsoon rains.

Domestic sugar production recovered in 2006. Risingworld sugar prices due to increased use of sugar-based bio-fuel further encouraged the domestic sugar production.

Forestry

In line with the Forestry Sector Master Plan, severalinitiatives were taken to promote forestry. Under theForest Resource Management Project funded by a loan fromthe ADB, for the development of silviculture, 1,843 hectaresof forest plantations were rehabilitated after clear fellingmature teak and Eucalyptus plantations while 1,254 hectareof new plantations were raised. In 2006, 23 RegionalPlantation Companies have also converted 22,300 hectaresof unutilised land into forestry.

Rubber production in 2006 continued to increaseregistering a growth of 4.6 per cent leading to 109 millionkg, registering the highest production after 1996.Attractive prices, coupled with increased demand led to aseries of productivity improvements such as increasedtapping intensity, usage of rain guards, planting new high-yielding clones and application of fertilisers. Weather alsoplayed a major role in raising production. Significant upsurgein crude oil prices caused the synthetic rubber prices alsoto rise. As a response to higher international prices, rubberexports increased sharply by 48 per cent to 47 million kg in2006. Although prices were high, its volatility was also high,both in the domestic and international markets. Cost ofproduction however showed an increase. The productivityof rubber needs to rise further, for the industry to withstandthe fluctuation of rubber prices in the world market.

Coconut production increased by 6.7 per cent in 2006benefiting from the lagged effect of favourable rainfalldistribution in almost all coconut growing areas.Increase in fertiliser application too contributed to raiseproduction.

The output of other agricultural export crops such ascinnamon, cloves, pepper, nutmeg, coffee, cocoa andarecanuts showed mixed performance in 2006. Theproduction of cinnamon, cashew kernels and pepperincreased by 3.7 per cent, 7.3 per cent and 1.2 per centrespectively, mainly due to the productivity improvementthrough the implementation of replanting and rehabilitationprogrammes coupled with the usage of improved technology,planting material and training programmes provided tofarmers. Increase in input prices has resulted in poor agro-management practices such as poor weeding and fertiliserapplications.

Domestic Agriculture

Paddy production registered a record high level of3,342,000 metric tons (growth of 2.9 per cent) in 2006despite the drop in production in 2006 Yala. Healthy

Fishing

Annual fish production in 2006 increased by 54 per centto 251 million kg reflecting a strong recovery. Both marineand inland and aquaculture fish production increased by 65.6per cent and 7.5 per cent, respectively. However, marinefishing in some coastal areas remained restricted due tosecurity reasons. Fishing industry is expected to recoverfully in 2007 achieving a total fish production of around 300million kg, exceeding the pre-tsunami production level.

Industry

During 2006 the industrial sector which includes miningand quarrying, manufacturing, electricity and water andconstruction grew by 7.2 per cent (8.3 per cent in 2005).The share of the industrial sector of total GDP remainedunchange at 27 per cent. The share of the manufacturingsector which is the largest sub-sector declined to 16.0 percent (16.3 per cent in 2005).

The output of the factory industries, which grew by 6.2per cent in 2005 increased further by 5.9 per cent in2006. This growth was achieved despite the challengesposed by the volatile oil prices, the intensified globalcompetition in the apparel industry and the deceleration ofeconomic activities in the Northern and the Eastern

Provinces due to the escalation of security concerns. Boththe export market oriented industries and domestic marketoriented industries contributed to this growth. Private sectorindustries, which accounted for 96 per cent of the output inthe factory industry sector in 2006 grew by 5.8 per cent whilepublic sector industries registered a 7.6 per cent growth.The two sub-categories of private sector industries, BOI andNon-BOI, grew by 5.9 per cent and 5.6 per cent respectively,and contributed 55 per cent and 45 per cent, respectively,to the overall factory industry output.

The impetus for growth in industrial output in 2006 arosemainly from four out of the nine industrial categories,viz., food, beverages and tobacco products; textile, appareland leather products; chemical, rubber, plastic andpetroleum products; and non-metallic mineral products.These categories accounted for around 90 per cent of thegrowth in the industrial sector in 2006.

The major drivers in the export oriented industries weretextiles and apparel, rubber gloves and tyres, processeddiamond, gem and jewellery, ceramic products, plasticproducts and petroleum products. These industriesbenefited from rapid global economic growth, expansion intrading activities with regional countries such as India andPakistan under free trade agreements, penetration into newniche markets in Europe, Asia-Pacific and SAARC region,and increased demand from the US and the EU markets.The depreciation of the rupee, productivity improvementsand enhanced marketing capabilities helped maintain theexport competitiveness in the international market despitethe relatively higher domestic inflation.

The domestic market oriented industries spread acrossa wide range of industrial products. These include

cement, building materials, ceramics, food, beverages,chemicals and fertiliser. The demand for these products grewin response to increased disposable income following theupward revision of salaries, growing construction industryand infrastructure development projects such as thoserelated to roads, highways, telecommunication and ports.The establishment of new industries and relocation ofindustries under the “Nipayum Sri Lanka” 300 enterprisesprogramme, the development of Thulhiriya textile complexand the progress in the “Gamata Karmantha” programme,are expected to expand the production capacity of domesticoriented industries further in the future.

Textiles, wearing apparel and leather products sectorgrew by 4.3 per cent in 2006 in comparison to the growthof 4.9 per cent achieved in 2005. This sub-sectorcontributed 39 per cent to the overall growth of factoryindustry in 2006. The slower growth in this sub-sector wasmainly attributed to the decline in volume of apparel exportsto the US market due to increased competition from lowcost producing countries such as China, India, Vietnam,Bangladesh and Pakistan. However, this was partly offsetby higher growth in exports to the EU market benefiting fromthe duty free concessions received under the GSP+ scheme.The apparel exports to the EU market in 2006 grew by 17.3per cent. However, the full benefit of this scheme has notyet materialized due to difficulties in complying with the rigidROO criteria which require apparel products to containminimum 50 per cent of domestic value addition. Somemanufacturers in the apparel industry were able to build uptheir strength through the gradual restructuring by way ofincreased product specialization, mergers and acquisitions,development of backward and forward linkages,improvements in quality of products and enhancement ofmarketing capabilities. The leather industry also performedwell in 2006 with the concessions received under the GSP+scheme.

The food, beverages and tobacco products, which aremainly catering to the domestic market, recorded ahigher growth of 6.0 per cent and contributed 22 percent to the overall growth in 2006. This higher growth isattributed to the improved performance in the processedfood, beverages, liquor, ice cream, biscuits, milk products,mineral water, fruits and vegetables and canned products.Increased demand for fruits and vegetables from the UKand biscuits from regional countries and the Middle Eastcountries, supported the growth of these industries.However, the output of tobacco products has declined,mainly due to the continuation of health awarenesscampaigns and the implementation of National Authority onTobacco and Alcohol Act.

The output of chemical, petroleum, rubber and plasticproducts grew by 8.3 per cent in 2006. Major impetus tothe growth of this sub-sector came mainly from the rubberbased products, plastic and PVC products, chemical andpetroleum products. The output of plastic and PVC productsincreased by 11.5 per cent with the growth of constructionactivities. The rubber based products grew by 10.4 per centcompared to 25.0 per cent growth rate achieved in 2005.This is mainly due to the deceleration of the export of tyresto the US market in 2006. However, the demand for rubberbased products increased in the domestic market.

The output of non-metallic mineral products grew by10.9 per cent in 2006. The high growth in this sub-sectorwas driven by cement, ceramics, building materials andprocessed diamonds. Cement, ceramics and buildingmaterials grew at a higher rate with the increasedperformance of the construction sector and the infrastructuredevelopment projects. Major manufacturers of cement andbuilding materials have increased their capacities in orderto meet the increasing domestic demand. Glass bottlemanufacturing industry and gem and jewellery industry

expanded their capacity and produced specialised items forthe export market.

The fabricated metal products registered 3.1 per centgrowth in 2006. The domestic demand continued toincrease while exports also surged with the increaseddemand from the Middle Eastern countries.

The output of the public sector industries grew by 7.6per cent in 2006 led by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation(CPC), which accounted for 90 per cent of the public sectorindustrial output. The output in CPC grew by 7.8 per cent in2006. The output in Sevanagala Sugar Industries and LankaSalt Ltd grew by 27.4 per cent and 20.6 per cent,respectively, in 2006.

The profit ratio of the factory industry sector, estimatedas the ratio of ex-factory value of production over thetotal cost of production of non-BOI firms surveyed in2006 was 14.6 per cent and grew by 2.1 per centcompared with 2005. Increased domestic sales, effectivesourcing of raw materials, better management of overheadcosts, adoption of new technology, reduction of waste,

enhanced labour productivity, better management of workingcapital, effective utilization of manpower, closure of non-profitable units and adoption of effective pricing policieshelped to maintain the profitability of firms. Intensiveutilization of information technology helped to improvestrategic decision making and marketing which in turn ledto the achievement of greater cost efficiency. The high costsof energy and imported raw materials increased the cost ofproduction of firms during 2006. However, the rising cost ofproduction was mitigated through the utilization of alternativeenergy sources.

The wage bill of the factory industry rose by 17.4 percent and as a percentage of total cost of production,increased from 12.0 per cent to 12.3 per cent in 2006.The wages, incentives and allowances were increasedreflecting the impact of high inflation and inflation expectationon cost of production during the year. Firms have takenseveral cost reduction measures in order to control the risingwage bill. These include effective utilization of existingmanpower, rationalising the overtime bill, improvingproductivity, outsourcing possible high cost units andengaging more casual or contract labour. Interest costs asa percentage of total cost of production increased marginallyas the cost of borrowings continued to rise.

The value addition generated by the processing ofplantation crops sub-sector was only marginal with agrowth of 1.1 per cent particularly due to the drop in teaproduction, adversely affected by weather conditionsand trade union actions during the latter part of the year.The growth in this sub-sector arose from the higherproduction in coconut and rubber with the increased demandfor rubber at higher prices from both domestic and foreignmarkets.

The small industry sub-sector which recorded animpressive expansion of 9.8 per cent in 2005 deceleratedto 5.3 per cent during 2006. The expansion in theconstruction sector exerted a positive impact on the smallscale production of timber milling, rock metal production and

tiles, bricks, cement blocks and related building materials.Small scale industrial activities of furniture and carpentry,bakery products, jewellery, garments and handlooms, leatherfootwear and other products also expanded in terms of valueadded contribution with the increased consumer demand.In tandem with the production of the agricultural outputs,paddy milling and other grinding activities expanded, but ata lower rate than that of the previous year.

The electricity and water sector continued to expandduring 2006. This sector, which grew by 24.5 per cent in2005, further expanded by 20.2 per cent during thecurrent year . The high growth rate in this sector wasrealized through the expansion in the electricity sub-sectorwhich grew by 22.2 per cent in value added terms duringthe year. The demand for electricity grew at a rate of 7.3 percent from domestic, industrial and commercial and othersectors despite the increase in tariff rates, which wererevised upwards twice during the year. In 2006, hydro powergeneration increased by 34.5 per cent while there was adrop in thermal power generation, as favourable weatherconditions in the catchment areas induced the generationof hydro power which replaced the need for thermal powerto some extent. Of the total power generation, the share ofhydro power generation increased to 49.5 per cent from ashare of 39.4 per cent in 2005. The water sub-sector, whichincludes collection, purification and distribution of pipe bornewater, recorded a growth of 4.2 per cent (3.8 per cent in2005). The various construction activities carried out duringthe year to make the basic need of water available to themasses contributed towards the growth.

The mining and quarrying sector expanded by 8.0 percent in real terms, (14.1 per cent in 2005) supported bythe boom in construction activities during the yearwhich showed the quarrying sub-sector expanding intandem. Mining sub-sector recorded a growth of 8.1 percent in 2006. The growth in gem exports during the latterhalf of the year supported the growth in this sub-sector.Mining activities related to mineral sand and phosphateproduction declined during the year while there was anoutput increase in graphite production during the secondhalf of the year.

During 2006 the construction sector recorded a growthof 8.0 per cent over a relatively high growth rate of 8.9per cent in 2005. Tsunami related construction workcontinued to progress during 2006 as well, particularly interms of housing projects, but at a lower growth momentumthan in 2005 during which urgently required reconstructionactivities took place. Construction activities related to thedevelopment of the road network and improvements in thepower sector, together with projects to increase the publicaccess to water resources consumed a significant portionof the spending from foreign funding. The expansion in thesector was also reflected in the growth in constructionmaterial consumption of both locally produced and imported

items. Particularly cement consumption, which is a keyindicator in the activity levels of the construction sector,continued to grow considerably in 2006 as well. Privatesector construction in housing and condominium projectsexpanded during the year as reflected by the growth inadvances obtained from the banking sector for the purposeof housing construction. But the significant price increasein construction materials had a dampening effect particularlyon small scale construction activities. The overall priceincrease in building materials were observed in the priceindices published by the Institute for Construction Trainingand Development (ICTAD) with an increase of 19 per centover an increase of 14 per cent in 2005.

Services

As in previous years, the growth in the services sectorprovided the major impetus for growth in 2006. Theservices sector grew by 8.3 per cent and accounted to ashare of 56.2 per cent of the GDP. The continuation of thegrowth momentum reflected in the sector, has mainly beena response to increasing consumer demand, for services inthe country. The continued investment on economic servicesand infrastructure and productivity improvements also pavedthe way for emergence of the services sector as the maincontributor of the economic growth.

The Wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurantssector recorded a growth of 5.9 per cent (2.8 per cent in2005), largely due to the improved performance of theimport trade sub-sector, which grew by 7.5 per cent,recovering from low growth in the last year. The structureof import trade growth reflected the expansion in domesticdemand. The import of consumer goods increased by 10per cent, in volume terms, while that of investment goodsincreased by 8.8 per cent. Of consumer goods imports,imports of basic food items, such as wheat grain and sugarincreased while rice imports dropped due to the bumperharvest recorded in 2006. Imports of other consumer goods,such as motor vehicles and household goods, grew by 11.7per cent. Within the investment goods category, imports ofbuilding material increased by 3.4 per cent as against thehigh base reflecting the expansion in the construction sector.However, the import of transport equipment dropped by 2.6percent as against 11.8 per cent increase in the previousyear. The volume of intermediate goods imports also grewby 5.0 per cent with the increase in crude oil, other petroleumand raw material imports for industries catering to the exportand domestic market.

Export trade sub-sector recorded a growth of 4.4 percent in 2006 as against 6.9 per cent in the previous year.The deceleration was partly due to lower growth in industrialexports particularly in other industrial category whichconsisted of food, beverages and tobacco, rubber productsetc. Textile and garment exports which is the majorcontributor to the industrial exports grew by 5.1 per cent

and exports of petroleum products and other types ofindustrial exports grew by 27.4 per cent and 0.8 per cent,respectively. Agricultural exports increased by 5.6 per centwith high exports in all three main plantation crops. Rubberexports expanded significantly by 42.8 per cent during theyear in relation to a 17.5 per cent drop in 2005. The increasein the international prices of rubber by 43 per cent onaverage, also stimulated the exports.

The domestic trade sub-sector expanded by 4.5 per cent,mainly driven by the satisfactory performance in boththe domestic agriculture and industry sub-sectors.Paddy production, fishing, small industry and domesticfactory industries heavily contributed to this growth.However, the recent strengthening of security measuressomewhat constrained the expansion of the domestic tradingactivities in the country.

The hotels and restaurants sub-sector recorded agrowth of 6.3 per cent with a 1.9 per cent increase intourist arrivals over the low base post-tsunami. Thissector was however affected by the escalation of securityconcerns in the country during the second half of the year.Although the tourism industry has made an almost completerecovery from the damages caused by the tsunami and hasreported 20 per cent growth in the first half of the year, theindustry reported 5.8 per cent drop in the second half of theyear. Low occupancy in the last quarter of the year in resortsand city hotels around the country have impacted heavilyon the tourism sub-sector. Tourist arrivals from WesternEurope increased only by 0.6 per cent, while tourists fromthe Asian sub-continent continued to increase by 8.4 percent during the year. Although the tourist arrivals increasedmarginally during the year, foreign guest nights of gradedhotels increased by 15.4 per cent while local guest nightsdropped marginally.

Within the services sector, Transport, storage andcommunication expanded by 13.1 per cent, (11.7 percent in 2005) owing largely to robust expansion in thepost and telecommunications sub-sector. This sub-sector, that had continued to grow at a high pace, expandedfurther by 23 per cent, benefiting from recent developmentsin telecommunication, particularly broad band networks andexpansion in coverage with new technology incommunication. Mobile and Fixed line service providingcompanies in telecommunication industry have had anexcellent year, marking a significant 37 per cent growth inrevenue. Clearing the backlog for fixed telephone lines withCDMA technology, subscriber levels of Fixed Access–LocalLoop subscriber level recorded 651,681 new connections,an expansion of 52 per cent during the year. In the recentpast, both CDMA and GSM technology had allowed ruralresidents to get phone services immediately. The subscriberlevel of mobile phones expanded further by 61 per cent and

the subscriber level is reported to be 5.4 million. Meanwhile,the Internet and e-mail subscriber level grew by 13 per centwith developments in infrastructure which provide goodquality, high speed data connectivity for internet access.

The cargo handling, storage and warehousing sub-sector expanded by 13.2 per cent during the year. Despitethe work to rule campaign at the Jaya Container Terminal(JCT) by trade unions in the month of July, the number ofcontainers handled, transshipment activities and total cargohandled had improved considerably. The commencementof new shipping services through the Port of Colombo bymore international shipping companies also contributed tothis growth. The Colombo Port including South Asia GatewayTerminal (SAGT) handled a significant volume of 3.08 millionTEUs in 2006. The transshipment volume which usuallyaccounts for around two thirds of the total throughputhandled, expanded by 37 per cent, while domesticthroughput volume increased marginally.

The transport sub-sector expanded by 5.1 per cent asagainst the growth of 3.3 per cent during the previousyear. Growth in Road haulage activities by 5.3 per cent wasmainly owing to satisfactory performance in external tradeactivities and was the reason for this growth. Aviationservices grew further in 2006 with the total passengerkilometres flown by the Sri Lankan Airlines and domesticairlines had increased by 9 per cent, despite high fuel pricesand a drop in tourist arrivals. The passenger kilometresoperated by Sri Lanka Railways and Cluster Bus Companieshad declined during the reference period.

The Financial services, real estate and businessservices sector, which includes banking, insurance andall other financial services, real estate, ownership ofdwellings, renting and all other business serviceactivities, grew by 9.7 per cent in 2006, as against 6.5per cent growth in the previous year. Financial servicesreported 10.5 per cent growth with credit expansion of thebanking sector and healthy performances in other financialservices sub-sectors. During the year, income of thecommercial banks expanded significantly with increase ininterest income on advances and investments on securities.Meanwhile, non-interest income of the commercial banksimproved owing to increased activities in the forex market.Leasing and registered finance companies also reportedhealthy growth during the year. The better performance inreal estate and higher activities in certain business serviceshad resulted in expansion of the real estate, renting andbusiness services sub-sector by 6.2 per cent. The real estatesector recorded a significant growth with the boom incondominium development projects. Many conglomeratesalso invested in condominium industry during the year dueto the profitability in real estate activities.

The Public administration, other government servicesand defence and other community, social and personalservices sector grew by 2.8 per cent as against anincrease of 5.4 per cent during the previous year. ThePublic administration, other government services anddefence sector reported only a 1.5 per cent growth as therewere no major public sector recruitment programmes duringthe year. However growth in this sub-sector was partly dueto the expansion in armed forces. The other community,social and personal services sub-sector recorded a growthof 4.8 per cent partly due to healthy growth in the privatehealth care industry, entertainment and educational services.

2.4 Expenditure

The aggregate demand generated by domesticeconomic activity is measured by Gross DomesticExpenditure (GDE), which is the sum of consumptionand investment expenditure of the private and publicsectors of the economy. In 2006, GDE (aggregatedomestic demand) at current market prices was estimatedat Rs. 3,125 billion, reflecting an increase of 20.9 per centover 2005. The corresponding increase in domestic demandfor 2005 was 16.7 per cent. The higher economic growth aswell as higher growth in prices in 2006 stimulated the higherexpansion of the GDE. GDE grew by 8.7 per cent in realterms as against a growth of 4.7 per cent in 2005. Althoughboth private consumption and private investmentexpenditure rose during 2006, the share of consumptionexpenditure as a percentage of GDP declined to 73.8per cent, which indicates a higher growth in investmentactivities in the economy. GDP at current market prices,which is the sum of GDE and net imports of goods and non-factor services, was estimated at Rs. 2,802 billion, a growthof 18.4 per cent.

Consumption

Consumption expenditure which captures both theprivate and government sector consumption of theeconomy has expanded by 18.6 per cent to Rs. 2,322billion during 2006. This growth in consumption was a resultof real consumption expanding by 7.2 per cent and of theoverall increase in price levels by 10.7 per cent. Of the totalconsumption, Private Consumption Expenditure (PCE)constituted a share of 89 per cent, which showed a declinefrom a share of 90 per cent in 2005. In terms of origin ofproduction, expenditure of locally produced goods andservices has grown by 14.6 per cent whilst that of importedgoods and non-factor services increased by a higher marginof 24.8 per cent.
