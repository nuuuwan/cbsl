There are two principalmethods of measuring market risk under the Standardised Measurement Method, i.e. a \u2018maturity\u2019 methodand a \u2018duration\u2019 method. It has been decided to adopt the \u2018duration\u2019 method to arrive at the capital charge.Accordingly, banks are required to measure the general market risk charge by calculating the price sensitivityof each instrument in the trading book separately and adding the resulting price sensitivities based on amaturity ladder, subject to disallowances if any.",

Under the shorthand method, thenominal amount of the net position in each foreign currency and in gold is converted at spot rates into thereporting currency (i.e. LKR). The overall net open position is measured by aggregating:\u2022 the sum of the net short positions or the sum of the net long positions, whichever is the greater; plus\u2022 the net position (short or long) in gold, regardless of sign.The capital charge will be 10% of the overall net open position of foreign currency and gold.",

The ratio will then be calculated in relation to the sum of the two, using as the numeratoronly eligible capital.8.2 In calculating eligible capital, it will be necessary first to calculate the bank's minimum capital requirement forcredit risk, and only afterwards its market risk requirement, to establish how much tier 1 and tier 2 capital isavailable to support market risk. Eligible capital will be the sum of the whole of the bank's tier 1 capital, plus allof its tier 2 capital under the limits imposed in the Notice on maintenance of the Capital Adequacy Ratio issuedby the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Tier 3 capital will be regarded as eligible only if it can be used to supportmarket risks under the conditions set out in paragraphs 7.1 and 7.2 above. The reported capital ratio will thusrepresent capital that is available to meet both credit risk and market risk.",

The original of theconfirmation document should be sent to the OMO Division before the close of business on the same day.b.Upon the receipt of confirmation of a deal, the OMO Division will enter all the details to the electronic biddingsystem (under outright purchase auction option) and the details will be submitted to the PSD through the electronicbidding system on or before 1530 hours of same day.c.The minimum amount of a transaction shall be Rupees one million and deals should be in multiples of Rupeesone million.d.PIs whose deals are accepted could view such acceptance through the on-line electronic bidding system (underoutright purchase auction option) by 1530 hours on the same day.4.The settlement of the transactions will be on a delivery versus payment (DVP) basis through the Matched Trade Feedfacility available in LankaSecure. The Matched Trade Feed file will be submitted to LankaSecure at or before 0830hours on the settlement date on the basis of which, the system will credit the respective settlement accounts of the PIsfor the purchased value of securities against the receipt of the securities purchased into the own Account of the CBSLin Lankasecure. The PIs are not required to submit any settlement instruction in this regard to the system.5.The purchase value (price) will be calculated by discounting the face value of securities purchased by the pre-determinedrate for the remaining period to maturity of the security.6.The acceptance by the CBSL of an offer of a PI to sell CBSL securities at a pre-determined rate is binding on the PIand the failure to honour the transaction (sale by PI) before the close of business of LankaSecure on the settlementdate will render the PI liable to pay damages to the CBSL, equivalent to the interest component on the sale value forthe remaining period to maturity at the pre-determined rate. Such amount shall be debited to the PI\u2019s SettlementAccount with the CBSL on the next business day following the settlement date.D.S.WijesingheDirectorDomestic Operations",

Fast advancement oftechnology and sophistication of financial products and systems have made financial institutions ) (FIs) vulnerable tooperational risk caused by inadequacies or failures of internal processes, systems and external events including naturaldisasters. Therefore, a failure to manage operational risks may expose the FIs to significant losses. There is a growinginterest internationally among regulatory bodies and FIs to strengthen Business Continuity Planning (BCP). Basel IIframework has identified operational risk of banks as a distinct risk category (in addition to credit risk, interest rate riskand liquidity risk that financial institutions take in return for an expected reward), which exists in day-to-day operations.Therefore, supervisory authorities in many developed countries and Bank for International Settlements (BIS) \u2013 Committeeon Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) have recommended 10 Core Principles for Systemically Important PaymentSystems (Principle VII \u2013 Security, Reliability & Continuity), BIS/International Organization of Securities Commissions(IOSCO) Recommendations for Securities Settlement (recommendation 11 \u2013 Operational Reliability) andRecommendations for Central Counterparties (recommendation 7 \u2013 Operational Risk) to cope effectively with theconsequences of operational risk in payment and securities settlement systems.",

Accordingly, CBSL requested PIs to submit their BCPs to CBSL by end March, 2005.Since most of the BCPs forwarded by PIs were incomplete or applied a multitude of standards of their own, CBSL heldone to one meeting with each PI during the period of July to August 2005 to explain the required standard of BCP, andrequested to submit revised BCPs to CBSL before the end of August, 2005. Since a number of PIs requested CBSL toprovide written guidelines on BCPs and the fact that CBSL also desires to develop a consistent framework for BCPs, theCBSL has prepared a set of guidelines.",

Each FI is encouraged to consider and follow the suggested process for business continuity planning:*Adopt clear and well defined BCP policy and strategy;*Establish clear roles and responsibilities to oversee the BCP implementation programme. This may require settingup of a formal business continuity management team with the powers and responsibilities to coordinate planning andimplementation;*Key functions under each system should be clearly identified and processes within these functions to be categorizedagainst their criticality. Assumptions behind these categorization need to be documented and reviewed regularly bythe senior management;*Conduct a business impact analysis to assess the impact and probability of possible disruption scenarios on all(owned, shared and external) critical banking/business, payment and settlement systems; resources and infrastructure,and formulate recovery time objectives (RTO); and resumption of critical functions;*Each critical business/support functions should formulate its own recovery strategy on how to achieve the RTO andto deliver the minimum level of critical services derived from business impact analysis. In the case of a payment andsettlement system, the best practice for a business continuity arrangement is to aim at recovery and resumption ofcritical operations of systemically important payment systems not later than 2 hours after the occurrence of a disruption;system-wide important payment and settlement system within the same/scheduled settlement date; and effecting asmall number of critical payments (such as payment settlement on market liquidity or monetary policy) on time.*Adopt critical and tough assumptions for each plausible disruption to: assess possible threats (external and internal),their impact and probability; and ensure that the framework would be sufficient to withstand the impact of thedisruption (on each component of the system). This involves establishing a disaster recovery site (minimum one sitein Sri Lanka with critical infrastructure components, required number of skilled staff, work space, software application,technology requirement, relevant SWIFT link and vital data/information compatible with recovery objectives statedin the BCP). It is important to ensure geographical separation between primary site and disaster recovery site(DRS).*Determine recovery strategies and providing of each service considering the interdependency among critical servicesand time frame assessment in business impact analysis.*Establish at least the minimum BCP requirement for the provision of critical businesses. These BCP requirementsshould be approved by the senior management before proceeding to the development of BCP. Further, BCP requirementshould be considered at the planning/development stages of new business services/products.*The best practice is to establish \u2018Disaster Management Team (DMT)\u2019. The DMT may be a group of senior management(for example: heads of department of banking operations, IT, Back Office, building/premises, human resources andcommunication) who would direct the recovery operations.*FI must develop, implement and maintain a BCP document, which provides guidance for crisis management procedureand information, which enable the senior management of FI to respond to disruption and recover critical businessesin a contingency event to avoid contagion effect on business of the FI as a whole.*The dimension of a disruption is another important element to be considered in identifying scenarios. The bestpractice is for senior management to identify all plausible crisis scenarios including disasters covering a wide area,transportation, telecommunication, key personnel, payment system and other key infrastructure and develop crisismanagement process and procedures. Scenarios should be documented and revised when regular business impactanalysis requires them to be changed. The crisis management process at a minimum should include:",
