Dear Sirs,

INADEQUATE/ INCORRECT DISCLOSURES/ PRESS STATEMENTS BY BANKS

As intimated to you at the Chief Executive Officers meeting held on 23 March 2006, there have been severalinstances where banks have attempted to mislead the public by publishing incorrect statements/data or by not publishingcertain aspects of information with regard to non-compliance with statutory regulations.

Such attempts by banks to mislead the general public totally negate the efforts of the regulator to educate the publicon the true state of the banks in the industry, and it would be futile to further enhance our efforts in this regard, if immediateaction is not taken by the regulator to stop such deception. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) will be faulted forpermitting the banks to misrepresent their financial condition to the public.

It is incumbent on bank management, in the discharge of their fiduciary responsibility, to project the true picture oftheir financial condition to the public.

Therefore, in the interest of providing accurate information to the public for making informed decisions, all banksare required, in making statements to the press, and in publishing the financial results of banks, to ensure that adequatepublicity is given to non-compliance, if any, with the prudential ratios and the measures being taken by the bank to meetthese ratios.

Where banks, which are not compliant with regulatory requirements, do not make such disclosures to the public inpress interviews or statements, the CBSL, as the regulator will be compelled to correct such information in the publicdomain.

Yours faithfullySgd. / Director of Bank SupervisionCopy To: Secretary General/SLBA

BANKING ACT

Direction made by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka under Section 46(1) and 19(7) of the Banking ActNo. 30 of 1988 as amended by the Banking (Amendment) Act No. 33 of 1995 and Act No. 2 of 2005.

Sgd. / Sunil Mendis GovernorColombo01/03/2006

DIRECTION ON THE PRUDENTIAL NORMS FOR CLASSIFICATION, VALUATION AND OPERATION

OF THE BANK’S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

1.With effect from 31 March 2006, all Licensed Commercial Banks are required to classify their investment portfoliounder two categories: i.e. the Investment Account and the Trading Account. All banks are required to maintain twoseparate books of accounts for this purpose.

2.Banks should decide on the category of investment at the time of acquisition and the decision should be documented.Classification is not a free choice but is based on facts and the management’s intent at the date of purchase. Transfersbetween categories after initial recognition are restricted.

(vi)

Major Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2006

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report 2006

Part III

3.The criteria for classifying and valuation of the bank’s investment portfolio are as provided below:

A.Investment Account(a)All securities acquired with the positive intent and ability to hold till maturity shall be classified under theInvestment Account.(i)Positive intent cannot be demonstrated if:*the bank has the intent to hold the securities for only an undefined period; or*the bank stands ready to sell the securities in response to changes in market interest rates or risks, liquidityneeds, changes in the availability of the yield on alternative investments, changes in financing sources orterms, or changes in foreign currency risk; or*the issuer has a right to settle the securities at an amount significantly below its amortised cost.(ii)The ability to hold the securities to maturity cannot be demonstrated if:*the bank does not have the financial resources available to continue to finance the investment until maturity;or*the bank is subject to legal or other constraints that could frustrate its intention to hold the securities tomaturity.(iii) When a bank’s actions cast doubt on its intent or ability to hold investments to maturity, the Central Bank ofSri Lanka shall retain the right to reclassify all or part of the Investment Account as Trading and require appropriateprovisioning.

(b)All unlisted securities (eg. shares, debentures) should generally be classified under the Investment Account. However,government securities will have to be classified based on the rules specified under point A(a) above.(c)Securities in the Investment Account may be used for repurchase transactions.(d)Securities in the Investment Account shall be carried and reported at acquisition cost over the period of redemption.(i)Carrying values of interest bearing securities in the Investment Account may be adjusted to account for theaccretion of discount (or depletion of premium). The adjustments should be amortised annually on a straight-line basis over the period to maturity.(ii)All other securities should be maintained at cost. Any impairment in value which is considered to be permanentshould be fully provided for in the Profit & Loss Account immediately. The following conditions should betaken into consideration in deciding on whether there is an impairment of value.*Track record of dividends/returns – Non receipt of dividends/returns for a consecutive period of threeyears, should be considered as an impairment and the investment should be classified as non performing.*Market prices – A continuously declining trend in market prices, with the investment value being belowcost for over three years should be considered as an impairment in value.(iii) The Central Bank of Sri Lanka will retain the flexibility to consider specific requests/exceptions in this regard.(iv) Any impairment in value or losses on the sale of investments held in the Investment Account should be taken tothe Profit & Loss Account.(e)Sale of securities classified under the Investment Account should only be an insignificant amount of the investmentportfolio and should be limited to circumstances that do not taint the rest of the portfolio. These circumstances are:*if the investment was close enough to maturity or call date so that changes in the market rate of interest couldnot have a significant effect on the investment’s market value;*the sale is made after the entity has collected substantially all of the investment’s original principal throughscheduled payments or prepayments;*the sale was due to an isolated event that was beyond the entity’s control, non-recurring and could not havebeen reasonably anticipated.

B. Trading Account(a)All securities acquired for the specific purpose of trading on a regular basis (at least every quarter), to take advantageof the short-term changes in market prices and yields, shall be classified under the Trading Account. The classificationof Trading assets is based on original intention and these are not transferred to the Investment category becauseintention subsequently changes.(b)Securities held in the Trading Account must be revalued or marked to market on a daily basis. In the case of securitiesfor which daily prices are not available, banks are advised to mark to market at least on a weekly basis. Where two-way quotes are published (eg. Rates for government securities), the middle rate should be adopted.

(vii)

Part III

(c)Any gains or losses on the sale of investments held in the Trading Account should be taken to the Profit & LossAccount.C.Transfer of SecuritiesThe transfer of securities between portfolios will generally not be permitted, except under specified circumstances.This is to limit the opportunities to manipulate the recognition of gains or losses or to mark changes in market value.(a)Transfer of securities between the Trading Account and the Investment Account must be justifiable, documentedand authorised.(b) Portfolio transfers to or from the Investment Account shall only be undertaken rarely (preferably at the beginning ofthe accounting year), with the approval of the Board of Directors, the Assets and Liability Committee or the InvestmentCommittee. The circumstances justifying such transfers are given below:(i)A change in the statutory and regulatory requirements.(ii)A significant increase in the capital requirements that may oblige the Bank to reduce its investment holdings.(iii) A major business occurrence that necessitates the transfer of securities to maintain the Bank’s risk profile.(iv)Exceptional circumstances such as tight liquidity conditions and extremely volatility.(c)The carrying value of securities transferred from the Trading Account into the Investment Account shall be marked tomarket prior to the transfer. Therefore, any gains or losses due to revaluation would have been recognised in earningsprior to the transfer. The market value of the securities at the point of transfer into the Investment Account thenbecomes the ‘acquisition cost’ for accounting purposes.(d) A statement on portfolio transfers, if any, shall be signed by the Chief Executive Officer of the Bank and submittedthe Bank Supervision Department of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, on a quarterly basis.(e)The Central Bank of Sri Lanka will retain the right to review the statement of portfolio transfers and require the bankto make provisions if considered necessary.

DIRECTION ON THE PRUDENTIAL NORMS FOR CLASSIFICATION, VALUATION AND OPERATION

OF THE BANK’S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

1. With effect from 31 March 2006, all Licensed Specialised Banks are required to classify their investment portfoliounder two categories: i.e. the Investment Account and the Trading Account. All banks are required to maintain twoseparate books of accounts for this purpose.

2. Banks should decide on the category of investment at the time of acquisition and the decision should be documented.Classification is not a free choice but is based on facts and the management's intent at the date of purchase. Transfersbetween categories after initial recognition are restricted.

3. The criteria for classifying and valuation of the bank’s investment portfolio are as provided below:

A. Investment Account(a) All securities acquired with the positive intent and ability to hold till maturity shall be classified under the InvestmentAccount.(i) Positive intent cannot be demonstrated if:• the bank has the intent to hold the securities for only an undefined period; or• the bank stands ready to sell the securities in response to changes in market interest rates or risks, liquidity needs,changes in the availability of the yield on alternative investments, changes in financing sources or terms, orchanges in foreign currency risk; or• the issuer has a right to settle the securities at an amount significantly below its amortised cost.

(viii)

Major Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2006

Part III

(ii) The ability to hold the securities to maturity cannot be demonstrated if:• the bank does not have the financial resources available to continue to finance the investment until maturity; or• the bank is subject to legal or other constraints that could frustrate its intention to hold the securities to maturity.(iii)When a bank’s actions cast doubt on its intent or ability to hold investments to maturity, the Central Bank of SriLanka shall retain the right to reclassify all or part of the Investment Account as Trading and require appropriateprovisioning.(b) All unlisted securities (eg. shares, debentures) should generally be classified under the Investment Account. However,government securities will have to be classified based on the rules specified under point A(a) above.(c) Securities in the Investment Account may be used for repurchase transactions.(d) Securities in the Investment Account shall be carried and reported at acquisition cost over the period of redemption.(i) Carrying values of interest bearing securities in the Investment Account may be adjusted to account for the accretionof discount (or depletion of premium). The adjustments should be amortised annually on a straight-line basis overthe period to maturity.(ii) All other securities should be maintained at cost. Any impairment in value which is considered to be permanentshould be fully provided for in the Profit & Loss Account immediately. The following conditions should be takeninto consideration in deciding on whether there is an impairment of value.• Track record of dividends/returns – Non receipt of dividends/returns for a consecutive period of three years,should be considered as an impairment and the investment should be classified as non performing.• Market prices – A continuously declining trend in market prices, with the investment value being below cost forover three years should be considered as an impairment in value.(iii) The Central Bank of Sri Lanka will retain the flexibility to consider specific requests/exceptions in this regard.(iv) Any impairment in value or losses on the sale of investments held in the Investment Account should be taken tothe Profit & Loss Account.(e) Sale of securities classified under the Investment Account should only be an insignificant amount of the investmentportfolio and should be limited to circumstances that do not taint the rest of the portfolio. These circumstances are:•if the investment was close enough to maturity or call date so that changes in the market rate of interest could nothave a significant effect on the investment's market value;•the sale is made after the entity has collected substantially all of the investment’s original principal through scheduledpayments or prepayments;•the sale was due to an isolated event that was beyond the entity's control, non-recurring and could not have beenreasonably anticipated.

B. Trading Account(a) All securities acquired for the specific purpose of trading on a regular basis (at least every quarter), to take advantageof the short-term changes in market prices and yields, shall be classified under the Trading Account. The classificationof Trading assets is based on original intention and these are not transferred to the Investment category becauseintention subsequently changes.(b) Securities held in the Trading Account must be revalued or marked to market on a daily basis. In the case of securitiesfor which daily prices are not available, banks are advised to mark to market at least on a weekly basis. Where two-wayquotes are published (eg. Rates for government securities), the middle rate should be adopted.(c) Any gains or losses on the sale of investments held in the Trading Account should be taken to the Profit & LossAccount.

C. Transfer of SecuritiesThe transfer of securities between portfolios will generally not be permitted, except under specified circumstances.This is to limit the opportunities to manipulate the recognition of gains or losses or to mark changes in market value.(a) Transfer of securities between the Trading Account and the Investment Account must be justifiable, documented andauthorised.(b) Portfolio transfers to or from the Investment Account shall only be undertaken rarely (preferably at the beginning ofthe accounting year), with the approval of the Board of Directors, the Asset and Liability Committee or the InvestmentCommittee. The circumstances justifying such transfers are given below:(i) A change in the statutory and regulatory requirements.(ii) A significant increase in the capital requirements that may oblige the Bank to reduce its investment holdings.(iii)A major business occurrence that necessitates the transfer of securities to maintain the Bank’s risk profile.(iv)Exceptional circumstances such as tight liquidity conditions and extremely volatility.

3. Form 4 of the existing capital adequacy return issued to all Licensed Specialised Banks will be replaced with the newform 4 and form 5 attached herewith.

DEFINITIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPUTATION OF A CAPITAL CHARGE FOR

MARKET RISK

1.Introduction1.1Market risk is defined as the risk of losses in on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions arising frommovements in market prices. The market risks subject to the capital charge requirement are:(a) The risks pertaining to interest rate related instruments in the trading book;(b) Foreign exchange risk (including gold positions) throughout the bank; and(c) The risks pertaining to equities in the trading book.

2.Scope and coverage of the capital charge for market risks2.1These guidelines address the issues involved in computing capital charges for interest rate related instrumentsand equities in the trading book and foreign exchange risk (including gold positions) throughout the bank. Forthe purpose of these guidelines, the Trading Book will include the following:(i)Securities classified in the ‘Trading Account’ in terms of the direction on Prudential Norms forClassification, Valuation and Operation of the Bank’s Investment Portfolio issued by the Central Bank ofSri Lanka.(ii) Open gold positions

(iii) Open foreign exchange positions

2.2Banks are required to manage the market risks in their books on an ongoing basis and ensure that the capitalrequirements for market risks are being maintained on a continuous basis, i.e. at the close of each businessday. Banks are also required to maintain strict risk management systems to monitor and control intra-dayexposures to market risks.

3Measurement of the capital charge for interest rate risk3.1This section describes the framework for measuring the risk of holding or taking positions in debt securitiesand other interest rate related instruments denominated in Sri Lanka Rupees as well as foreign currencies inthe trading book.

3.2 The capital charge for interest rate related instruments would apply to the current market value of these itemsin the bank’s trading book. Since banks are required to maintain capital for market risks on an ongoing basis,they are required to mark to market their trading positions on a daily basis. The current market value will bedetermined according to the direction on Prudential Norms for Classification, Valuation and Operation of theBank’s Investment Portfolio issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

3.3 The minimum capital requirement is expressed in terms of two separately calculated charges, (i) “specificrisk” charge for each security, which is akin to the conventional capital charge for credit risk, both for short andlong positions, and (ii) “general market risk” charge for interest rate risk in the portfolio, where long and shortpositions in different securities or instruments can be offset.

Specific risk3.3.1 The capital charge for specific risk is designed to protect against an adverse movement inthe price of an individual security owing to factors related to the individual issuer.

3.3.2 The risk charges to be used in the calculation of specific risk will be as follows:

Specific risk charge for government securities and central banks:(i) Government securities issued by the Government of Sri Lanka and securities issued by the CentralBank of Sri Lanka will be subject to a risk charge of 0%.

(ii) Securities issued by a foreign government or by a foreign central bank will be subject to a riskcharge based on the credit rating as indicated in Table 1 below.

All others1.60% (residual term to final maturity greater than 6and up to and including 24 months)10.00% (residual term to final maturity exceeding24 months)10.00%

The ‘Qualifying’ category:(iii) Corporate entities will be given a risk charge for specific market risk based on their ratings asindicated in Table 2 below:

• The specific risk charge for foreign corporates would be one notch less favourable than the risk charge applied to the local corporates.

(iv) ‘Public sector entities’ should be treated like corporate entities unless they are backed by an explicittreasury guarantee, which warrants a risk charge of 0%.

The ‘Other’ category:(v) A capital charge of 10% will apply to all other types of exposures.

General Market Risk3.3.3 The capital requirements for general market risk are designed to capture the risk of loss arising fromchanges in market interest rates. In general, the capital charge is the sum of four components:(a)the net short or long position in the whole trading book;(b)a small proportion of the matched positions in each time-band (the “vertical disallowance”);(c)a larger proportion of the matched positions across different time-bands (the “horizontaldisallowance”), and(d)a net charge for positions in options, where appropriate.Note – Components (b), (c) and (d) will not apply at present.3.3.4 It has been decided to allow banks to initially adopt the Standardised Measurement Method, as Sri Lankanbanks are still at a nascent stage of developing internal risk management models. There are two principalmethods of measuring market risk under the Standardised Measurement Method, i.e. a ‘maturity’ methodand a ‘duration’ method. It has been decided to adopt the ‘duration’ method to arrive at the capital charge.Accordingly, banks are required to measure the general market risk charge by calculating the price sensitivityof each instrument in the trading book separately and adding the resulting price sensitivities based on amaturity ladder, subject to disallowances if any.

Table 6Example of the shorthand measure of foreign exchange risk

4Measurement of the capital charge for equities4.1The minimum capital requirement to cover the risk of holding or taking positions in equities in the trading bookis set out below. It applies to all instruments that exhibit market behaviour similar to equities. The instrumentscovered include equity shares (voting and non-voting), convertible securities that behave like equities (eg. unitsof unit trusts) and commitments to buy or sell equity securities (eg. Warrants, right issues and bonus issues).Specific and general market risk4.1.1Specific risk is defined as the bank’s gross equity positions (i.e. the sum of all long equity positions and ofall short equity positions). The capital charge for specific risk for equities on the Milanka Price Index willbe 5%, while all other equities will have a specific risk charge of 10%.4.1.2General market risk is defined as the overall net position in an equity market (i.e. the difference betweenthe sum of the longs and the sum of the shorts). The general market risk charge will be 10%.

5Measurement of the capital charge for foreign exchange and gold open positions5.1This section sets out the minimum capital requirement to cover the risk of holding or taking positions in foreigncurrencies, including gold. Gold is treated as a foreign exchange position rather than a commodity because itsvolatility is more in line with foreign currencies and banks manage it in a similar manner.5.2Forward contracts will be included in computation of the capital charge for foreign exchange risks.5.3Computing the capital requirement for foreign exchange risk consists of two processes.5.3.1Measuring the exposure in a single currency positionThe bank's net open position in each currency should be calculated by summing the net position of all onbalance sheet and forward contracts denominated in that particular currency.5.3.2Measuring the risks inherent in a bank's mix of long and short positions in different currencies.Banks are required to adopt the shorthand method of computation. Under the shorthand method, thenominal amount of the net position in each foreign currency and in gold is converted at spot rates into thereporting currency (i.e. LKR). The overall net open position is measured by aggregating:• the sum of the net short positions or the sum of the net long positions, whichever is the greater; plus• the net position (short or long) in gold, regardless of sign.The capital charge will be 10% of the overall net open position of foreign currency and gold.

In the above example, the capital charge would be 10% of the higher of either the net long currencypositions or the net short currency positions (i.e., 300) and of the net position in gold (35) = 335 x10% =33.5.

6Aggregation of the capital charge for market risks6.1 The capital charges for specific risk and general market risk should be computed separately before aggregation.The format at Form 4 may be used for computing the total capital charge for market risks.

7Definition of capital7.1 The principal form of eligible capital to cover market risks consists of core capital (tier 1 capital) and supplementarycapital (tier 2 capital) as defined in the Notice on maintenance of the Capital Adequacy Ratio issued by theCentral Bank of Sri Lanka on 27 December 2001. Banks are also permitted to employ a third tier of capital ("tier3"), consisting of short-term subordinated debt, as defined in paragraph 7.2 below, for the sole purpose of meetinga proportion of the capital requirements for market risks, subject to the following conditions:•banks will be entitled to use tier 3 capital solely to support market risks as defined in paragraph 1 of thisdirection. This means that any capital requirement arising in respect of credit risk, needs to be met by theexisting definition of capital (i.e. tiers 1 and 2 subsequent to all necessary adjustments);•tier 3 capital will be limited to 250% of a bank's tier 1 capital that is available to support market risks.

(xiv)

Major Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2006

Part III

•a minimum of about 28_% of market risks needs to be supported by tier 1 capital that is available to supportmarket risks.• tier 2 elements may be substituted for tier 3 up to the same limit of 250% so far as the overall limits stated inthe Notice on maintenance of the Capital Adequacy Ratio issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka are notbreached, i.e. eligible tier 2 capital may not exceed total tier 1 capital, and long-term subordinated debt maynot exceed 50% of tier 1 capital;•in addition, tier 1 capital should represent at least half of total eligible capital, i.e. the sum total of tier 2 plustier 3 capital should not exceed total tier 1.•In determining the level of tier 1 capital for the purposes of determining eligible tier 3 capital, all adjustmentsrequired in arriving at the total capital base (as stated in the Notice on maintenance of the Capital AdequacyRatio issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka) should be taken into consideration.7.2 For short-term subordinated debt to be eligible as tier 3 capital, it needs, if circumstances demand, to be capableof becoming part of a bank's permanent capital and thus be available to absorb losses in the event of insolvency.It must, therefore, at a minimum:•be unsecured, subordinated and fully paid up;•have an original maturity of at least two years;•not be repayable before the agreed repayment date unless the prior consent of the Central Bank of Sri Lankais obtained;

8Calculation of the capital ratio8.1 In order to ensure consistency in the calculation of the capital requirements for credit and market risks, anexplicit numerical link will be created by multiplying the measure of market risk by 10 (i.e., the reciprocal of theminimum capital ratio of 10%) and adding the resulting figure to the sum of risk-weighted assets compiled forcredit risk purposes. The ratio will then be calculated in relation to the sum of the two, using as the numeratoronly eligible capital.8.2 In calculating eligible capital, it will be necessary first to calculate the bank's minimum capital requirement forcredit risk, and only afterwards its market risk requirement, to establish how much tier 1 and tier 2 capital isavailable to support market risk. Eligible capital will be the sum of the whole of the bank's tier 1 capital, plus allof its tier 2 capital under the limits imposed in the Notice on maintenance of the Capital Adequacy Ratio issuedby the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Tier 3 capital will be regarded as eligible only if it can be used to supportmarket risks under the conditions set out in paragraphs 7.1 and 7.2 above. The reported capital ratio will thusrepresent capital that is available to meet both credit risk and market risk.

Dear Sirs

PARALLEL COMPUTATION OF BASEL I AND BASEL II

As indicated to you at the meetings of the CEOs of LCBs and LSBs, and as agreed with the SLBA sub committee on RiskManagement and Implementation of Basel II, a parallel computation of Basel I and Basel II will commence from the firstquarter of 2006, until full implementation of Basel II in the first quarter of 2008.

The Capital Adequacy Computation under Basel I will be the effective statutory capital ratio during this period of parallelruns. While the attached guidelines on Basel II are not in final form, they will be refined over the period, based on the resultsof the test computations, during the period of the parallel run.

Initially, during this period, the CAR under Basel II should be computed on a bank only (solo) basis.

These draft guidelines contain 3 parts, viz. the introductory guidelines, the format for computation of the capital ratio, andthe definitions for the items in the computation.

All computations on Basel II should reach this Department by the end of the month following the end of each quarter,together with the CAR computation under Basel I.

Your cooperation in this regard will be greatly appreciated.

Yours faithfullySgd. / Director of Bank Supervision

Claims that meet the following criteria qualify for inclusion in the regulatory retail portfolio. All performing exposuresincluded in such portfolio qualify for a 75% risk weight.Qualifying Criteria for the Regulatory Retail Portfolio:*Orientation criterion – The exposure should be to an individual person or persons or to a SME*Product criterion – The exposure should be of one of the following product types:-Revolving credit and lines of credit including overdrafts and credit cards-Personal term loans and leases (eg: installment loans, vehicle loans and leases, student and educational loans,personal finance)-SME loans-Securities such as bonds and equities are excluded (to be treated as investments).-Loans secured by property mortgages that qualify for inclusion as claims secured by residential property areexcluded (see 6 below)*Granularity criterion – The regulatory retail portfolio must be sufficiently diversified to a degree that reduces therisks in the portfolio. In order to meet this criterion, no aggregate exposure without considering CRM, to onecounterpart should exceed 0.2% of the overall regulatory retail portfolio (excluding any non-performing retailloans) (one counterpart – one or several entities that constitute a single beneficiary, eg: in the case of a smallbusiness affiliated to another small business, the limit would apply to the bank’s aggregate exposure on bothbusinesses)*Low value of individual exposures – The maximum aggregate retail exposure to one counterpart cannot exceedthe lower of 0.2% of capital funds or Rs. 10 million

Definition of SME (to be finalized):*Asset values not exceeding Rs. 35 million, excluding land and building; and*Maximum size of the loan to be Rs. 35 million* Annual turnover not more than Rs. 30 millionTwo of the above three criteria should be met

6Loans granted for residential purposes, secured by Residential PropertyResidential housing loans fully secured by a primary mortgage over residential property that is or will be occupied bythe borrower, or rented, qualify for a risk weight of 35%.

The banks should strictly adhere to the qualifying criteria to be able to use the preferential risk weight.

In order to qualify for this concessionary risk weight, the following valuation criteria should be met: a margin of atleast 75% on the value of the property at the time of granting the loan, valuation by an external independent valuer,frequency of valuation etc.

7Past due loans7.1The unsecured portion of any loan (other than a qualifying residential mortgage loan) that is past due for morethan 90 days, net of specific provision will be risk weighted as follows:7.2In order to determine the secured portion of a loan, the collateral at 10 could be deducted.7.3Past due residential mortgage loans

*Past due (past due for > 90 days) residential mortgage loans – risk weight at 100% net of specific provisions*If the specific provision on such pastdue residential mortgage loans > 20% of the outstanding amount, riskweight at 50%

10.Credit Risk Mitigation (CRM)Where a transaction is secured by the following eligible collateral and meet the eligible criteria outlined below, therisk weight applicable to the collateral instrument could be substituted for the risk weigh of the counterparty in respectof the portion of the exposure that is collateralized.

Simple Approach (similar to Basel I) is recommended for use by all banks – apply the risk weight applicable to thecollateral for the secured portion of the loan

Partial collateralization will be permitted, i.e. a part of a loan could be covered by the collateral.

However, mismatches in the maturity of the underlying exposure and the collateral will not be allowed, i.e. the collateralmust be pledged for at least the life of the exposure.

10.1 Prerequisites:*Legal certainty- All documents used in collateralized transactions and for documenting on-balance-sheetnetting, guarantees etc. must be binding on all parties and legally enforceable in the relevant jurisdictions.The banks should conduct sufficient legal review to verify this and undertake such further review as necessaryto ensure continuing enforceability.*Banks have a right to liquidate or take legal possession of collateral in a timely manner in the event of default.Banks must take all necessary steps to fulfill the requirements under the law to protect the bank’s interest inthe collateral eg. registering with a registrar.*In order for the collateral to provide protection, the credit quality of the counterparty and the value of thecollateral must not have a positive correlation, eg. securities issued by the counterparty or by any relatedgroup entity would be ineligible.*Banks must have clear and robust procedures for the timely liquidation of collateral.*Where the collateral is held by a custodian, banks must take reasonable steps to ensure that the custodiansegregates the collateral from its own assets.10.2 Subject to the general conditions set out above, the following forms of collateral are eligible for recognitionunder the Simple Approach to CRMa. Cash (including certificates of deposit, savings certificates issued by the lending bank) under lien to the bankb. Gold – gold bullion held in vaults of the banks and certificatesc. Debt securities rated by a recognized external credit assessment institution where these are either:*At least BB- when issued by sovereigns or PSEs that are treated as sovereign by the national supervisor;or*At least BBB- when issued by other entities (including banks)*At least A-3/P-3 for short term debt instrumentsd. Debt securities not rated by a recognized ECAI where these are:*Issued by a bank; and*Listed on a recognized exchange; and*Classified as senior debt; andSubject to a discount of 25% on the market valuee. Equities (including convertible bonds) that are included in a main index, subject to a discount of 25% on themarket value

In addition, loans and advances which are guaranteed by a licensed commercial bank or a licensed specialized bankincorporated in Sri Lanka or abroad may be assigned the risk weight applicable to the respective bank.

11.External Credit Assessments*The national supervisor will determine the External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAI) that meet the eligibilitycriteria set out in Basel II and map the risk ratings against the relevant risk weights.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report 2006

Part III

*If there is only one assessment by an ECAI for a particular claim, that assessment should be used to determine therisk weight applicable. If there are two assessments which map into different risk weights, the higher risk weightwill be applied.

B. Operational Risk under the Basic Indicator Approach

KBIA = [ (GI 1…n x α)]/n

KBIA = the capital charge for operational risk under the Basic Indicator Approach

GI = annual gross income, where positive, over the previous three years

n = number of the previous three years for which gross income is positive

α = 15%

Gross Income = net interest income plus net non-interest income (net interest income before provisions and operatingexpenses, excluding realized profits/losses from the sale of securities (trading and investment) and excluding extraordinaryor irregular items) (Definition given in the Basel Accord)

It is suggested that the following formula be used to compute the ‘gross income’Operating profit+ provisions+ Operational expenses+ losses made on sale of securities- profits made on sale of securitiesExclude extraordinary/irregular items

C. Capital charge for Market Risk

To be computed according to the Directions issued in this regard (will remain unchanged under Basel II).

The exposure on off-balance sheet items is to be included in the computation of the risk weighted capital ratio. Theconversion of the credit risk inherent in each off-balance sheet item would be converted in to an on-balance sheet creditequivalent by multiplying the principal amount by a credit conversion factor. Credit equivalent amount would then beweighted according to the external credit rating applicable to the corresponding asset item.

Note :(i)The netting of contracts subject to novation would be permitted. Therefore, the net rather than thegross claims arising out of swaps and similar contracts (subject to novation) with the samecounterparts will be weighted. In this context, novation is defined as a bilateral contract betweentwo counterparties under which any obligation to each other to deliver a given currency on a givendate is automatically amalgamated with all other obligations for the same currency and value date,legally substituting one single net amount for the previous gross obligations.(ii) To arrive at the credit equivalent amounts of Exchange Rate and Interest Rate contracts, applyingthe original exposure method a bank will have to apply one of the following two sets of conversionfactors to the notional principal amounts of each instrument according to the nature of the instrumentand its maturity.OriginalInterest RateExchange RateMaturityContractsContractsLess than one year0.5%2.0%One year and less than Two years1.0%5.0% (i.e. 2% + 3%)For each additional year1.0%3.0%(iii) As in the case of the credit equivalents of other off-balance sheet items, the credit equivalentamounts of Exchange Rate and Interest Rate contracts are to be weighted according to the categoryof counterparty. For Exchange Rate and Interest Rate related contracts, however a 50% weightwill be applied in respect of counterparties which would otherwise attract a 100% weight (e.g.commercial clients). In other words, the credit equivalents of foreign exchange and Interest Ratecontracts are subject to four categories of risk weights, i.e. 0%, 10%, 20% and 50% depending onthe nature of the counterparties instead of the normal five categories of risk weights for otherexposures.

Dear Sirs,

REVERSAL OF UNEARNED INCOME AND CLASSIFICATION OF ADVANCES AS NON-PERFORMING

As intimated to you at the Chief Executive Officers meeting held on 23 March 2006, when an advance is classified as non-performing, the unearned income for the three months prior to the classification, which was recognized as interest incomeshould be reversed and treated separately as interest in suspense. The reversal of unearned income identified after the closeof a financial year could be accounted for in the financial year in which the advances were identified as non-performingadvances.

Accordingly, all banks that have hitherto not reversed interest earned but not received on non-performing advances arerequired to do so with effect from 01.01.2006, as recognizing such income would be tantamount to the inclusion of fictitiousincome in the income statement.

2.The availability of security or net worth of borrower/ guarantor should not be taken into account for purposes ofclassification as non-performing advances, and even cash-backed advances should be treated as non-performing advanceswhen in arrears for over three months, as specified in the Direction. Such consideration would be relevant only at thetime of provisioning.

3.These provisions will be incorporated into the amended Directions on classification, which will be issued in duecourse, after considering the responses received from the banks, in respect of the other matters discussed in the draftdirection.

CLASSIFICATION OF BANKING OUTLETS

Reference is made to the discussion on the above subject at the meeting of the CEOs of licensed banks held on 23.03.06 andthe subsequent requests made by banks in the above regard. All licensed banks should name and operate their bankingoutlets in conformity with the classification given in the Annexed schedule.

Dear Sirs,

DRAFT GUIDELINES ON THE COMPUTATION OF THE CAPITAL RATIO

UNDER BASEL II

Clarifications sought by the banks with regard to the parallel computation of Basel I and Basel II and issues raised by thebanks at the meeting of the SLBA sub-committee on Basel II held on 26. 05. 2006, are circulated herewith for the informationof all banks.

All banks are kindly requested to make note of these clarifications for future computations.

1.Identification of the retail and SME Portfolio1.1. In order to qualify for the preferential risk weight for the regulatory retail and SME portfolio under Basel II,banks have to identify and segregate them for supervisory validation. Therefore, it is important that banksdevelop their information systems to identify and segregate such portfolios early, in order to be able to apply theconcessionary risk weights upon implementation of Basel II.1.2. Definition of SME – to be finalized based on the suggestions of the SLBA sub-committee on “Retail/SMEdefinitions”, and subsequent to review of supporting data from banks.1.3 It is also suggested that instead of the 3 criteria presently suggested by CBSL, the following two criteria be usedto identify SMEs:*Asset values not exceeding Rs. 35 million, excluding land and building*Annual turnover of the SME not more than Rs. 30 million (to be decided)

Further, since SME is part of the retail portfolio, the SME portfolio, too should be subject to the same qualifyingcriteria as the retail loans. Please refer the annexed addendum to the draft guidelines on Basel II for the revised criteriafor retail and SME.

2.Other clarifications2.1Whether a credit card holder enjoying an overdraft and a term loan facility could be considered under the regulatoryretail portfolio?Only personal loans and personal overdrafts could be considered for inclusion under the retail portfolio (orientationand product criterion). Accordingly, if the overdraft and term loan have been granted for business purposes, theywould not qualify for inclusion under the retail portfolio. Subject to meeting the qualifying criteria, they couldbe included under the SME portfolio.2.2Would advances granted for a sole proprietorship qualify for inclusion under the retail portfolio or the SMEportfolio?Under the SME portfolio, subject to meeting the qualifying criteria2.3Residential Mortgages – Ascertaining the value of the property when the land is owned by the borrower and theloan is granted for construction. Whether, 75% could be applied on the BOQ value in such instances as there isno valuation for the land?Whether loans granted to purchase a house in a condominium property could be considered under the category of“Loans granted for residential purposes, secured by Residential Property”? If the answer is yes, then what is the valueto be considered in classifying the loan under the above category (since condominium properties do not have anyvaluations)?

The valuation used by the bank for lending purposes should be considered as the value of the property.

2.3Credit Rating of Collateral – In the event the credit rating of the collateral covering the exposure is lower than thecredit rating of the borrower, which rating should be used for risk weighting the exposure?

If the credit rating of the collateral is lower than that of the borrower, the collateral does not provide credit riskmitigation. Therefore, it will not be a collateralized transaction for purposes of Basel II.

Yours faithfullySgd. / Director of Bank Supervision

Annex

Revised criteria for identification of the Regulatory Retail and SME Portfolios

Performing claims that meet the following criteria would qualify for inclusion under the regulatory retail and SME portfolios,and would qualify for a preferential risk weight of 75%.

Qualifying criteria for the Regulatory Retail Portfolio1.Orientation Criterion – the exposure should be to an individual person for personal purposes

2.Product criterion – The exposure should be of one of the following product types:ßRevolving credit and lines of credit including personal overdrafts and credit cardsßPersonal term loans and leases (eg: installment loans, vehicle loans and leases, student and educational loans,personal finance)ßSecurities such as bonds and equities are excluded (to be treated as investments).ßLoans secured by property mortgages that qualify for inclusion as claims secured by residential property areexcluded

3.Granularity criterion – The regulatory retail portfolio must be sufficiently diversified to a degree that reduces the risksin the portfolio. In order to meet this criterion, no aggregate exposure without considering CRM, to one counterpartshould exceed 0.2% of the overall regulatory retail portfolio (excluding any non-performing retail loans) (one counterpart– one or several entities that constitute a single beneficiary, eg: in the case of a small business affiliated to anothersmall business, the limit would apply to the bank’s aggregate exposure on both businesses)

4.Low value of individual exposures – The maximum aggregate retail exposure to one counterpart cannot exceed thelower of 0.2% of capital funds or Rs. 10 million

Dear Sirs,

PREVENTION OF FRAUDS USING ELECTRONIC CARDS

Recent reports have highlighted the use of credit cards and ATM cards for fraudulently withdrawing large sums of moneyfrom banks in many countries, especially in the South East Asian region.

The Presidential Secretariat, by its letter dated 06 June 2006 has drawn the attention of the Central Bank to the need to takeprecautionary measures to avert the possibility of such attempts being made even in Sri Lanka, considering the particulardanger of terrorist groups using them as a means of creating a sense of insecurity in a vital sector of the economy.

Accordingly, Licensed Banks that issue electronic cards to customers should, as soon as is practicable take steps to:1.Introduce security features such as tamper-proof micro chips for electronic cards, and in the interim-2.Take appropriate steps to educate their customers with regard to the safety of their electronic cards and remind them atregular intervals the steps that should be taken by them, in order to avoid being victims of fraudulent use of such cards.3.Ensure that adequate provision is made annually for the necessary investment in technology.

The banks are also encouraged to introduce other relevant security measures in respect of ATM cards/machines. It issuggested that CCTV cameras be installed at all ATM outlets in order to enhance the surveillance at ATM outlets.

Your views on this matter are welcome for discussion at the forthcoming monthly meeting of CEOs on the 22 June 2006.

Yours faithfullySgd./ Director of Bank Supervision

REVERSE REPURCHASE FACILITY

The Reverse Repurchase Facility (RRF) of the Central Bank is available to the commercial banks to address their urgentliquidity issues and is designed to be accessed as a last resort. However, certain banks have resorted to the use of the RRFas a regular source of funding. The ill effects of regular borrowings from RRF of the Central Bank were explained to banksindividually and collectively over the past six months by the Central Bank and the banks were requested to arrangealternative sources of funding, without relying on the RRF regularly.

It is also noted that when the commercial banking system has a liquidity surplus, there will be no necessity for anylicensed commercial bank which has a liquidity shortage to resort to the RRF of the Central Bank since such a shortagecould be met out of the overall surplus in the system.

Hence, with effect from 1 January 2007, the RRF of the Central Bank will not be available on days when there is a liquiditysurplus in the commercial banking system, as per the Central Bank estimates. The days when the RRF is not made availableon such grounds, will be notified through the online Money Market Information System/ Electronic Bidding System onthat day at 9.30 a.m.Actg.

BCP Guidelines No: 01/200629 March 2006

To: Chief Executive Officers ofall Licensed Commercial Banks, Primary Dealers, Central Depository Systems (Pvt) Ltd.and LankaClear (Pvt.) Ltd.

GUIDELINES ON BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANNING

Introduction1. Financial sector is an interdependent network of financial institutions, markets and systems. Fast advancement oftechnology and sophistication of financial products and systems have made financial institutions ) (FIs) vulnerable tooperational risk caused by inadequacies or failures of internal processes, systems and external events including naturaldisasters. Therefore, a failure to manage operational risks may expose the FIs to significant losses. There is a growinginterest internationally among regulatory bodies and FIs to strengthen Business Continuity Planning (BCP). Basel IIframework has identified operational risk of banks as a distinct risk category (in addition to credit risk, interest rate riskand liquidity risk that financial institutions take in return for an expected reward), which exists in day-to-day operations.Therefore, supervisory authorities in many developed countries and Bank for International Settlements (BIS) – Committeeon Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) have recommended 10 Core Principles for Systemically Important PaymentSystems (Principle VII – Security, Reliability & Continuity), BIS/International Organization of Securities Commissions(IOSCO) Recommendations for Securities Settlement (recommendation 11 – Operational Reliability) andRecommendations for Central Counterparties (recommendation 7 – Operational Risk) to cope effectively with theconsequences of operational risk in payment and securities settlement systems.

2. Having considered the consequences of systemic risk which could be caused by disruption to operations of participatinginstitutions (PIs) of LankaSettle System, which is the systemically important payment and settlement system, the CentralBank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) advised PIs to have proper business continuity plans in order to achieve consistent level ofresilience in LankaSettle System. Accordingly, CBSL requested PIs to submit their BCPs to CBSL by end March, 2005.Since most of the BCPs forwarded by PIs were incomplete or applied a multitude of standards of their own, CBSL heldone to one meeting with each PI during the period of July to August 2005 to explain the required standard of BCP, andrequested to submit revised BCPs to CBSL before the end of August, 2005. Since a number of PIs requested CBSL toprovide written guidelines on BCPs and the fact that CBSL also desires to develop a consistent framework for BCPs, theCBSL has prepared a set of guidelines.

3. The main objective of these guidelines is to explain the CBSL’s supervisory and oversight approach on BCP and provideguidance on sound practices, which CBSL encourages, FIs to follow in order to:*Have workable and sound BCPs for core banking/critical businesses and systems including systemically importantand system-wide important payment and securities settlement systems to ensure that the agreed service levels are

a) Includes licensed commercial banks, Primary Dealers and other payment, clearing and settlement service providers supervised/overseen by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

Major Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2006

Part III

met in an event that one or more business or components of a system fail. Moreover, BCPs should ensure continuityof agreed services in an event of a prolonged and widespread disruption;* Minimize the financial, legal, and other risks arising from such disruptions; and* Develop a consistent framework for BCPs of FIs supervised/overseen by CBSL.

Definition of Business Continuity Plan (BCP)4. ‘Business continuity planning’ refers to: planning and preparation need to be carried out in advance to identify theimpact of potential risks and losses caused by a disruption or a disaster; formulating and implementing viable recoverystrategies; and planning to ensure continuity of an institution’s services particularly in the area of core banking/criticalbusinesses, payment, clearing and securities settlement; and administering of comprehensive testing and maintenance.A ‘Business Continuity Plan’ (BCP) refers to a set of processes, procedures, information and measures which are developed,compiled and maintained for critical business functions including core banking and payment and settlement, in readinessfor use in an event of an emergency or a disaster which may cause inability to fulfill critical or all business operations.In contrast to BCP, a ‘contingency plan’, refers to measures, which will enable the most critical business functions to beperformed in an event of a disruption. Therefore, the concept of BCP is much wider than a contingency plan.

5. Business continuity planning is a culture to be developed at all levels of staff and the required process needs to be wellintegrated with the day-to-day operations. The Board and the senior management of each FI should adopt a risk-basedframework in BCP. Establishing a comprehensive BCP with a minimum cost without compromising risk management isa challenging task. It would seem sensible for all FIs to have BCPs on the assumption that they may have to face andmanage an event of a widespread and prolonged disruption with the complete destruction of buildings and infrastructurein which the main offices of FIs are located, the loss of key staff, complete inaccessibility of the primary site, forcing theFIs to use back-up facilities for an extended period of time. Board of directors (Board) should take responsibility of BCPreadiness.

6. FIs may decide to have two-tier plans – one (which would be fully developed with adequate resources to put into effectimmediately) to handle short-term problems; and the other (may be a medium/long term plan) to cope with long-termissues.

7. These guidelines are not intended to prescribe step-by-step guidance as to how FIs should conduct their BCP processand it could be considered as a minimum. The following of these guidelines will contribute to building a level playingfield for all FIs when implementing the BCPs and will help supervisors and overseers to evaluate the resilience of theoperations of FIs.

Application of the guidelinesOne of the supervisory/oversight objectives of CBSL is for FIs to have BCPs to ensure high preparedness for continuationof critical operations particularly core banking, payment, clearing and settlement in an event of a disruption. In the courseof its on-site examinations, offsite reviews, oversight and meetings on prudential issues with a FI, CBSL will reviewimplementation of the BCP on the practices set out in these guidelines particularly:*The extent to which the FI has observed the guidelines; and*The risk profile of the FI and its role in ensuring the stability of the financial system.

Guideline 1: Vest the primary responsibility for BCP preparedness on the Board of Directors and the managementof each FI

8. The Board and the senior management of each FI should take the primary responsibility for the BCP of the institutionand its effectiveness in relation to the nature and scale of its operations. The Board and the senior management shouldinvolve in business continuity management and consider FI’s business continuity, risks and mitigating measures as partof its overall risk management framework. The Board should: provide clear guidance and directions in respect of BCP;approve policy on BCP, prioritize critical banking/operations and payment system related business functions, allocatesufficient resources, review BCP test results; and ensure maintenance and periodic updating of BCP.

9. The senior management is responsible for: establishing appropriate policies, standards, strategies and processes forBCP; getting the BCP approved by the Board; getting commitment of all staff and executing such a BCP in an event ofa contingency. Senior management should endorse business continuity strategies of each system to ensure that plans

(lxxxvii)

Major Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2006

2

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report 2006

Part III

are consistent with overall business objectives, risk management strategy and financial and other resources. The seniormanagement should also evaluate the adequacy of contingency planning for each system and its periodic testing by itsown staff/service providers whenever critical operations are outsourced. Resilience and recovery measures shouldadequately cover the level of business activity, risk tolerance and its role in preserving the systemic stability of thefinancial system. Such measures should be clearly stated in the BCP and regularly reviewed. Senior managementshould be accountable to the Board for achieving the stated objectives of each system in the BCP and submit a report tothe Board at least annually indicating clearly:*The preparedness of the institution to achieve stated objectives of each system; and*The extent of alignment with these guidelines.

Such a report should be reviewed and updated regularly. The BCP must be reviewed at least annually by the FI’s internalauditor/or an external expert.

Guideline 2: Incorporate sound practices in the BCP

10. Each FI is encouraged to consider and follow the suggested process for business continuity planning:*Adopt clear and well defined BCP policy and strategy;*Establish clear roles and responsibilities to oversee the BCP implementation programme. This may require settingup of a formal business continuity management team with the powers and responsibilities to coordinate planning andimplementation;*Key functions under each system should be clearly identified and processes within these functions to be categorizedagainst their criticality. Assumptions behind these categorization need to be documented and reviewed regularly bythe senior management;*Conduct a business impact analysis to assess the impact and probability of possible disruption scenarios on all(owned, shared and external) critical banking/business, payment and settlement systems; resources and infrastructure,and formulate recovery time objectives (RTO); and resumption of critical functions;*Each critical business/support functions should formulate its own recovery strategy on how to achieve the RTO andto deliver the minimum level of critical services derived from business impact analysis. In the case of a payment andsettlement system, the best practice for a business continuity arrangement is to aim at recovery and resumption ofcritical operations of systemically important payment systems not later than 2 hours after the occurrence of a disruption;system-wide important payment and settlement system within the same/scheduled settlement date; and effecting asmall number of critical payments (such as payment settlement on market liquidity or monetary policy) on time.*Adopt critical and tough assumptions for each plausible disruption to: assess possible threats (external and internal),their impact and probability; and ensure that the framework would be sufficient to withstand the impact of thedisruption (on each component of the system). This involves establishing a disaster recovery site (minimum one sitein Sri Lanka with critical infrastructure components, required number of skilled staff, work space, software application,technology requirement, relevant SWIFT link and vital data/information compatible with recovery objectives statedin the BCP). It is important to ensure geographical separation between primary site and disaster recovery site(DRS).*Determine recovery strategies and providing of each service considering the interdependency among critical servicesand time frame assessment in business impact analysis.*Establish at least the minimum BCP requirement for the provision of critical businesses. These BCP requirementsshould be approved by the senior management before proceeding to the development of BCP. Further, BCP requirementshould be considered at the planning/development stages of new business services/products.*The best practice is to establish ‘Disaster Management Team (DMT)’. The DMT may be a group of senior management(for example: heads of department of banking operations, IT, Back Office, building/premises, human resources andcommunication) who would direct the recovery operations.*FI must develop, implement and maintain a BCP document, which provides guidance for crisis management procedureand information, which enable the senior management of FI to respond to disruption and recover critical businessesin a contingency event to avoid contagion effect on business of the FI as a whole.*The dimension of a disruption is another important element to be considered in identifying scenarios. The bestpractice is for senior management to identify all plausible crisis scenarios including disasters covering a wide area,transportation, telecommunication, key personnel, payment system and other key infrastructure and develop crisismanagement process and procedures. Scenarios should be documented and revised when regular business impactanalysis requires them to be changed. The crisis management process at a minimum should include:

(lxxxviii)

-The process for ensuring early detection of an emergency/contingency and prompt notification to the DMT aboutthe incident;-The process for the DMT to assess the overall impact on the respective institution and to make quick decision onthe appropriate action;-Clear criteria for activation of the BCP and/or alternate sites;-The process for obtaining information on the status of the recovery process;-A process for timely internal and external communication; and-A process for overseeing the recovery and restoration efforts of the affected services/facilities.*The best practice is for each business/support function to establish a business recovery team (which may have subteams) to carry out the business resumption process. FI should assign recovery personnel (as well as alternatepersonnel) with required knowledge/skills to each such team.*Business resumption process generally has three phases:-The mobilization phase – This phase involves notification to business recovery teams (using call-out tree, thepredefined sequence of points of contact of staff for dissemination of information) and vendors to obtain requiredservices; and follow predetermined sequence in the BCP (or revising the sequence if it is necessary);-The alternate processing phase – This phase involves the resumption of the business/service at DRS/or in adifferent way than the stipulated process. This may need record reconstruction and verification, establishment ofnew controls, alternative manual processes and alternative ways of dealing with customers/counterparties.-The full recovery phase - This phase involves a process for moving back to the primary site after a disaster/contingency event.*The BCP should: identify and plan for activities which would be required under each phase of business resumptionprocess; establish clear responsibilities; and develop and include recovery task’s checklist.*FI should pay special emphasis to ensure resilience of critical technology equipments/facilities to reduce the probabilityof having to activate the BCP in an inevitable disruption to business. The technology requirement for recovery ofeach business/support function should be specified in the recovery strategy for each function and FI should assignappropriate personnel/with alternate personnel for recovery of technical failures.*FI may use an appropriate business continuity model to handle prolonged disruptions, based on the risk assessmentof their business environment and the characteristics of their own operations.*Each BCP should clearly identify the recovery point objectives for data losses for each of the critical system and thestrategy to handle such data losses and information deemed vital for recovery of critical business/support functionsin the event of a contingency/disaster. Some of the protection measures:-Back-up vital records must be readily accessible for emergency retrieval;-Access to back up vital records should be adequately controlled to ensure the reliability of them for the use ofbusiness resumption.-Clear procedure indicating how and in what priority the vital records to be retrieved/created in the event that theyare lost/damaged/destroyed.-Institution should formulate a formal strategy for internal as well as external communication with key externalparties (regulators, investors, customers, counterparties, service providers, the media and other stakeholders) toensure dissemination of up-to-date and consistent information in a contingency situation.

Guideline 3: Test each aspect of the BCP regularly, completely and meaningfully

11. BCP should be tested regularly, completely and meaningfully considering qualitative and quantitative aspects, to measureits practicality and effectiveness; and to familiarize the staff with the location, recovery procedure at a disruption. Thisshould include:*Testing meaningfully all components of business processes including of connectivity, functionality and capacity ofthe infrastructure at the DRS;*Testing the applicability of strategic planning assumptions to evaluate its applicability, particularly in respect ofchanges in the business scope;*Measuring the awareness and preparedness of personnel and coordination with external parties;*Testing of interdependencies especially with external parties. These would be the offices or service providers locatedoutside Sri Lanka; and*Management should participate in the tests and be familiar with their roles and responsibilities in a contingencyevent.*To ensure effectiveness of a BCP, it is important to test regularly:- The whole system;-Call tree activation;

-Backup site to backup site;-Shared services;-Backup tape restoration; and-Retrieval of vital records.*A BCP needs to be tested at least once a year.*A document should be prepared giving test results, lessons learned and risk mitigating measures to be adopted andsubmitted for the approval of the senior management.

Guideline 4: Formulate recovery strategies and set recovery time objectives for critical operations

12. Effective recovery strategies help FIs to implement their BCPs in an orderly manner as planned, minimizing disruptionsand financial losses. FIs should identify their critical businesses and potential monetary as well as non-monetary lossesin an event of a contingency. This process helps the FIs to prioritize critical operations and determine recovery strategiesand RTO for critical business functions based on business impact analysis. Critical business functions vary among FIsbut functions, which involve core banking and settlement of large value payment instructions, clearing of paymentinstruments, obligations on settling funds/securities and maintaining customer/investor/public confidence are criticallyimportant. The RTO is the maximum acceptable duration of time that can elapse, before the lack of a business functionseverely impacts on the business entity. This includes both the time before a contingency is declared and the time toperform tasks to the point of business resumption.

Guideline 5: Manage interdependency risks

13.There is a growing interest in FI to redistribute risks and processes locally, regionally or globally. This has resultedhigher dependency on internal and external parties (clearing institutions, financial utility service providers, vendors andinfrastructure providers). Therefore, they should understand and appropriately mitigate interdependency risks of criticalbusiness functions. Any failure to manage interdependency risk has a potential to cause operational or systemicinefficiencies or the failure of institutions. These interdependency need to be taken into consideration in a BCP andsteps to be taken to establish a DRS (with SWIFT and other required communication links and systems) in Sri Lanka,and to develop recovery strategies as well as RTO to mitigate risks. A business continuity arrangement of a FI should notintroduce any risk to a systemically important or system-wide important payment, clearing and settlement system, itsoperator or participants and each FI should have an independent BCP for widespread and prolonged disruption to itsinfrastructure and critical services, without relying on another participant of such systems. If any critical functions aredependent on outsourced arrangements, adequate provisions should be in place to ensure operation of services by thirdparties.

Guideline 6: Plan for wide-area and prolonged disruptions

14.FIs should provide measures for scenarios, which may result significant losses or inaccessibility of critical infrastructureincluding SWIFT and telecommunication where there is a widespread or prolonged disruption.

Guideline 7: Practice separation policy to minimize concentration risk

15.FIs should practice separation policy to mitigate concentration risk. Disruptions may result in a non-availability ofcritical staff, information and required telecommunication links and payment infrastructure such as SWIFT. FIs shouldbalance and properly mitigate concentration risk, while not sacrificing the efficiency gains from centralization of businessprocesses and staff. Accordingly, FIs should take measures to separate critical business operations by:*Establishing primary site and DRS in different zones. One DRS with SWIFT and other required communicationlinks should be in Sri Lanka;*Separation of critical operations and their supporting IT operations; and*Separation of staff/cross training of staff.

16.FIs should adopt a change management procedure to update their BCPs in respect of changes with proper approval anddocumentation and also take steps to store copies of BCP at a location separate from the primary site. FI may disseminateany part of the BCP relevant to a concerned party including customers to create awareness enabling them to act inagreement with the FI. The part of the BCP available for reference of public may contain information relating to generalreadiness of the FI without any details of confidential nature.

17.FIs may also have insurance coverage as a mitigation strategy to minimize foreseeable risks and financial exposure in anevent of a disaster. But diligence needs to be exercised with regard to the nature of insurance and the certainty ofpayments.

18.Each FI is required to inform Director, Payments and Settlements (DPS) of CBSL immediately if its BCP is activated.Until the FI resolves the crisis, it should send periodic progress reports to DPS.

19.Each FI is required to forward the following documents to the Director, Payments and Settlements, Level 8, Tower 1,Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Colombo 1:(i) A copy of the revised BCP following these guidelines and approved by the Board for perusal of CBSL on or beforeSeptember 29, 2006;(ii) An annual risk management statement on or before January 15 of each year, indicating the critical systems, recoverytime objective of each system and plans as well as strategies to achieve them; and(iii)A quarterly statement within two weeks from the end of the relevant quarter, reporting contingency events (date,time and nature of the problem) occurred during the period for core banking/business and payment clearing andsettlement systems; action taken in each event to rectify; and time of rectification and steps taken to avoid suchfailures in future.Dr. Ranee JayamahaDeputy Governor

REPORTING SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS IN THE CENTRAL DEPOSITORY SYSTEM

As stipulated under custodial responsibilities of the system rules of LankaSettle, it is the sole responsibility of the DealerDirect Participants in the Central Depository System (CDS) to record the legal ownership of a security promptly andaccurately. There are different types of accounts in the system to record different types of transactions. However, it has beenobserved that most participants are recording security transactions in incorrect accounts in the CDS of the Central Bank inparticular for repos and reverse repos.

The following denotes the meanings of the four types of repo and reverse repo accounts available in the system from theparticipants’ point of view.1.Tradable Repo AccountCRE2.Non- Tradable Repo AccountCRR3.Tradable Reverse Repo AccountCRP4.Non- Tradable Reverse Repo AccountREP

Participants must record their repo and reverse repo transactions in the following manner.a) A repo transaction by a participant with a customer Securities must be held in the participant’s CRE or CRR accountgiving legal ownership to the customer.bA reverse repo transaction by a participant with another participant or with a customer Borrowing party (repo party)must transfer securities to the lending party’s (rev.repo party) CRP or REP account.

In addition to the above, outright sales of securities by a participant to a customer should be recorded in the account typeof CSL and no other securities transactions be recorded in this account. The details of accounts type available in LankaSecureare given in Annex I.

Accordingly, all participants are kindly requested to report above securities transactions in correct accounts as per SystemRules of LankaSettle issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL).C. PremaratneSuperintendent of Public Debt

SCHEDULE 1

MEASUREMENT OF MARKET RISK (CAPITAL CHARGE)

A. Fixed Income Instruments

PDs are required to calculate capital charges based on the standardised duration based method as follows,i.First calculate the price sensitivity of all instruments in terms of a change in interest rates of between 3.0 and 1.8percentage points (adjusted Basle rates) depending on the duration of the instrument as per Table 1 given below. (Forrev.repo portfolio, take maturity of the rev.repo instead of the security maturity)ii. Slot the resulting sensitivity measures into a duration-based ladder with the thirteen time-bands set out in Table 1;iii. Calculate the capital charge for trading plus rev. repo as follows;Market value of the individual security * modified duration * assumed change in yield. (Please see the schedule 3,for calculation of Modified Duration for Trading and Reverse Repo)iv. Subject to the lower of the long and short positions in each time-band to a 5% capital charge towards verticaldisallowance designed to capture basis risk; (Please see the Schedule 3)v. Carry forward the net positions in each time-band for horizontal offsetting across the zones subject to the disallowancesset out in Table 2. (Please see the Schedule 3)

Part III

Price sensitivity can be calculated in two different ways:1.Modified Duration * Change in yield; or2.Explicit calculation of the price change based on the formula outlined below which will be used in the riskweighted capital adequacy calculations.

Both approaches will give the same result for small (e.g. 1 to 50bps) changes in yields; however, in the case of largerassumed changes in rates, the latter approach will be more accurate due to the impact of convexity (which measuresthe sensitivity of duration itself to the change in the level of yield).

The price sensitivity of any instrument may be estimated by using the formula given below, where the discount rateto be used is the valuation rate used in marking that specific security to market.

The following procedure outlines the general valuation procedure in the event that such activityexists. The derivatives should be converted into positions of the relevant underlying instrument and should be subject tomarket risk charges as described in Schedule 1.i.Forward Contracts, including Forward Rate Agreements (FRA)These instruments are treated as combinations of long and short positions. The maturity of a FRA is the period untilit is delivered or the contract is exercised, plus - where applicable - the life of the underlying instrument.

1 The position should be reported as the market value of the notional underlying. Depending on the current interest rate, the market value of each leg of theswap (i.e., the 8 year bond and the 9 months floater) can be either higher or lower than the notional amount. For sake of simplicity the example assumesthat the current interest rate is identical with the one the swap is based on.

position in a government security with a maturity of five months and a short position in a government security witha maturity of two months.

ii. SwapsSwaps are treated as two notional positions in government securities with relevant maturities. For example, aninterest rate swap under which a PD is receiving floating rate interest and paying fixed will be treated as a longposition in a floating rate instrument and a short position in a fixed-rate instrument. Tenor of the floating rateinstrument is treated as equivalent to the period until the next interest fixing while the tenor of the fixed rate instrumentis treated as equivalent to the residual life of the swap.

Until a direct source is available, discount rates could be derived from the bid/off prices published by the PDD to valuethe swap transactions with appropriate additions for spreads, and applied similar to the bond pricing methodologydescribed in Schedule 1. In most of the cases, an appropriate margin has to be added to the government securities yieldcurve to obtain an accurate curve for swap valuation.

Appropriate valuation techniques may be developed for more complex financial market products when the need arises.

CALCULATION OF GENERAL MARKET RISK FOR INTEREST RATE

RELATED INSTRUMENTS (Example extracted from Amendment to the Capital Accord to Incorporate Market Risks-Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, January 1996 page 51 & 52)

1. A bank may have the following positions:

-Qualifying bond, $ 13.33 mn market value, residual maturity 8 years, coupon 8%;-Government bond, $ 75 mn market value, residual maturity 2 months, coupon 7%;-Interest rate swap, $ 150 mn1 bank receives floating rate interest and pays fixed, next interest fixing after 9 months,residual life of swap 8 years;-Long position in interest rate future, $ 50 mn1, delivery date after 6 months, life of underlying government security3.5 years.

2. Table 3 shows how these positions are slotted into the time-bands and are weighted according to the weights given inTable 1. After weighting the positions the next steps in the calculation will be:

(a) The vertical disallowance in time-band 7-10 years has to be calculated: The matched position in this time-band is 0.5(the lesser of the absolute values of the added (weighted) long and (weighted) short positions in the same time-band)which leads to a capital charge of 5% of 0.5 = 0.05 = $ 25,000. The remaining net (short) position is -5.125.

(b) The horizontal disallowances within the zones have to be calculated: As there is more than one position only in zone1, a horizontal disallowance can only be calculated in this zone. In doing this, the matched position is calculated as0.2 (the lesser of the absolute values of the added long and short positions in the same zone). The capital charge forthe horizontal disallowance within zone 1 is 40% of 0.2 = 0.08 = $ 80,000. The remaining net (long) position in zone1 is +1.00.

(c) The horizontal disallowances between adjacent zones have to be calculated: After calculating the net position withinzone 1 the following positions remain: zone 1 +1.00, zone 2 +1.125, zone 3 -5.125. The matched position betweenzones 2 and 3 is 1.125 (the lesser of the absolute values of the long and short positions between adjacent zones) Thecapital charge in this case is 40% of 1.125 = 0.45 =$ 450,000.

(d) The horizontal disallowance between zones 1 and 3 has to be calculated: The remaining net (long) position in zone1 is +1.00, in zone 3 the net (short) position is -4.00. If there were no offsetting between zones 1 and 3 allowed thecapital charge would be 5.00 = $ 5,000,000. However, the horizontal disallowance between the distant zones is100% of the matched position which leads to a capital charge of 100% of 1.00 = 1.00 = $ 1,000,000.

(e) The overall net position is 3.00 leading to a capital charge of $ 3,000,000.

CAPITAL ADEQUACY FOR COUNTER PARTY CREDIT RISK

PDs are required to arrive at the credit equivalent amount for the purpose of reckoning exposure to a counter party on.For this purpose, PDs should consider the market value of respective repo/rev.repo to find out the net exposure of theinvestment.

Step 1The net exposure of the repo and rev. repo find out using the following formulae.Repo=(market value – leg 1)Rev.repo=(leg 1 – market value)
