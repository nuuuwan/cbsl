FISCAL POLICY ANDGOVERNMENTFINANCE

The overall fiscal policystrategy continued to focuson strengthening fiscalconsolidation in 2006, whilecontinuing with the tsunamirecovery process andpromoting pro-poor and pro-growth development strategy ofthe government to reducepoverty and regional economicdisparity. The fiscal policystrategy was formulated within theoverall vision enunciated in the‘Mahinda Chintana ’ policydocument and in the Medium TermMacro Fiscal Framework (Mid-term Framework) covering thenext three years consistent withthe overall macroeconomicstrategy. The strategy is guided bythe targets stipulated in the FiscalManagement (Responsibility) Actof 2003.

Salient features of the fiscal framework were improvingrevenue, rationalising recurrent expenditure, enhancingpublic investment, revitalising the rural economy andstrengthening the financial performance of strategic publicenterprises.

The achievement of fiscal targets became a challengingtask in 2006. Major challenges were the high internationaloil prices, high inflation, high domestic interest rates andneed for meeting expenditure on enhanced security andrehabilitation. To improve the overall fiscal operations, aseries of measures were introduced including therationalising of the tax and tariff systems, strengthening oftax administration, revising the administered prices, allowingthe full pass-through of petroleum product price changesfrom July 2006 onwards and improving the utilisation ofavailable foreign resources.

Despite those tough challenges, the fiscal performancein 2006 indicated some improvements. Governmentrevenue continued its increasing trend and reached 17.0per cent of GDP from 16.1 per cent in 2005, responding tostrong efforts particularly in the areas of tax policy measures,tax administration and timely enactment of relevantlegislation. The total revenue collected in 2006 was onlymarginally below the annual target. The public investmentremained at 6.3 per cent of GDP as in 2005, compared tothe budgetary target of 8.3 per cent. The main areas ofinvestment were the infrastructure development and tsunamirelated reconstruction. Recurrent expenditure exceeded thetarget due to higher than budgeted expenditure on salariesand wages, pensions, fuel subsidies, national security andhumanitarian relief. The decline in capital expenditureagainst the original target and the increase in recurrentexpenditure resulted in the improvement of the overallbudget deficit to 8.4 per cent of GDP compared to the originaltarget of 9.1 per cent. However, although the budget deficitdeclined, the reduction in public investment and the overrun

in recurrent expenditure will adversely affect the long termgrowth prospects of the country. The government resortedto increased domestic financing to meet additional borrowingrequirement needed to finance the overrun on recurrentexpenditure and the marginal decline in revenue.

The outstanding debt to GDP ratio declined further to93.0 per cent of GDP at end 2006 from 93.9 per cent atend 2005 due to relatively high increase in the nominalGDP. The high outstanding debt to GDP ratio underscoresthe necessity of strict adherence to medium term fiscaltargets stipulated in the Mid-term Framework to achievefiscal sustainability.

The government has enunciated its long term policystrategy in the Ten Year Horizon DevelopmentFramework (Ten-year Vision), which stretches the policydirection beyond the Mid-term Framework. The overallthrust of the Ten-year Vision is placed on achieving aregionally balanced economic growth to reduce povertythrough the implementation of a number of projects.However, these efforts have to be complemented with timelyrectification of various deficiencies in the fiscal sector,including the tax system, public enterprises, pension systemand the civil service.

6.2 Fiscal Policy Direction and Measures

The focus of the overall fiscal policy strategy in 2006continued to be on strengthening fiscal consolidation,continuing the tsunami recovery process, promotingpro-poor and pro-growth development strategy toreduce poverty and regional income disparities andrevitalising the rural economy, enhancing publicinvestment and strengthening strategic publicenterprises. Measures aimed at increasing revenue andrationalising recurrent expenditure were implemented tofurther strengthen the fiscal consolidation process. Thetsunami recovery process focused on restoring livelihoodsand other infrastructure. The pro-poor and pro-growthpolicies which aimed at revitalising the rural economy,included the introduction and continuation of a number ofregional and rural projects and programmes. On the publicinvestment front, emphasis was given to acceleratedimplementation of projects with increased utilisation ofavailable foreign resources. The Strategic EnterpriseManagement Agency (SEMA) continued its efforts toimprove the financial performance of strategic publicenterprises.

In 2006, sustaining the increasing trend in governmentrevenue was given the highest priority, as it is a key tostrengthening the fiscal consolidation process. In thisconnection, measures were introduced to broaden the taxbase, revise tax rates, modernise the tax administration andstrengthen the legal and regulatory framework to containtax evasion and avoidance. Major measures included further

strengthening of the VAT system, rationalisation of corporateincome taxes and import duties, reintroduction of stampduties, increase of the Port and Airport Development Levy(PAL) and Betting and Gaming Levy, revision of the SocialResponsibility Levy (SRL), cess on non-essential importsand export of tea and rubber and excise taxes on cigarettes.The efforts to modernise the tax administration werecontinued with an emphasis on human resourcedevelopment. Measures were taken to create a taxpayer-

friendly culture so as to promote tax compliance. Thegovernment also took measures to ensure the timelyenactment of revenue related legislation to reduce theuncertainty.

Several changes were introduced to strengthen the VATsystem further. Streamlining of the VAT refund system,opening of a special account at the Central Bank to cater torefunds while avoiding delays in payments, increasing VATon the financial sector to 20 per cent from 15 per cent,increasing the mark-up applicable on VAT at the point ofimport to 7 per cent from 5 per cent in January 2006 and to10 per cent in November 2006, reducing the VAT rateapplicable on locally manufactured soft drinks and exemptingsome items from VAT to encourage local production werethe key measures implemented in this respect. To preventfraudulent actions in VAT refunds, the provision of a bankguarantee within a stipulated period was made necessary,while the applicable limit on refunds for the items in the 20per cent VAT band was fixed at 15 per cent.

Major measures introduced to rationalise corporateincome taxes included the reduction of the tax rate on Co-operative Societies and on Small and Medium Enterprises(SMEs), increase of the rate applicable to companies ofwhich taxable income exceed Rs. 5 million, fixing of the taxrate applicable to income and profit from the businesses ofgaming and auto lotteries at 40 per cent and applying a33 1/3 rate for newly quoted companies as an incentive forcapital market development. Meanwhile, the maximumpersonal income tax rate was increased to 35 per centcreating a new slab of Rs.500,000 for the 30 per cent taxrate. The 15 per cent income tax on income from exportingagriculture produce was removed to encourage this activity.Profits from processing primary agriculture produce wereexempted from income tax to promote the processing offruits and vegetables. The professional services extendedby Sri Lankan professionals, in or outside Sri Lanka forforeign currency, were also exempted from income tax asan incentive for fast emerging global professional serviceproviders.

Import duties were rationalised through a number ofmeasures. Accordingly, import duty rates on selected itemswere revised and some items were exempted from importduty with a view to increasing their domestic production.New measures were introduced to remove the anomaliesin tariff rates as recommended by the Trade and Tariff Clusterunder the National Council for Economic Development(NCED). Specific duties were introduced on certaincommodities to curb under-valuation. Towards the end ofthe year, tariffs on selected essential food items wereremoved or reduced for a specified period of time with aview to reducing the cost of living. In order to complementthese efforts, improved valuation methods were applied bySri Lanka Customs (SLC) to value imported items and

measures were taken to improve the customs surveillancemechanism. The SLC also adopted a Human ResourceDevelopment Plan to improve its efficiency.

Modernsation efforts of the tax administration werecontinued in 2006 in a number of ways. The corporatestructure of the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) wasreconstituted to strengthen the senior management toimprove tax administration, develop audit and surveillance,analyse policies, use new technology and develop humanresources. In addition, the revision of the time limit for lodgingtax returns, acknowledgement of appeals within 30 days ofreceipt, granting of a discount for taxpayers who pay taxesin advance and imposing a penalty on late payments werealso introduced to strengthen tax administration.

The Fiscal Management Reform Programme (FMRP),funded by a loan from the Asian Development Bank(ADB), continued in 2006. The FMRP aims at modernisingand strengthening the fiscal and revenue administration inthe country through the adoption of improved processes,enhanced human resource capabilities and complementinginformation technology improvements. The programmefocused on the restructuring and modernisation of the IRD,SLC, Excise and the Treasury Departments and the FinanceCommission. Key areas in which improvements were carriedout included human resource development through local andforeign training, creating a taxpayer-friendly culture andenhancing public awareness, institutional developmentthrough the restructuring of organisational structures andimproving information technology facilities and auditsystems.

The government introduced several measures torationalise recurrent expenditure. Domestic petroleumprices were adjusted in line with rising oil prices in theinternational market in April and May 2006 to contain thesubsidy cost on fuel. Further, in July 2006, the governmentallowed Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and LankaIOC Limited (LIOC) to determine retail prices of petroleumproducts and discontinued provision of fuel subsidies onpetrol and diesel, which was a major step taken to reducefiscal vulnerability. The fertiliser subsidy was rationalisedby targeting small scale low income farmers. Under the newscheme, all paddy farmers and other field crops growersreceived fertiliser at Rs.350 per 50 kg bag of urea, TripleSuper Phosphate (TSP) and Muriate of Potash (MOP). Thescheme was further extended to provide Urea at a subsidisedrate for the smallholder plantation sector. Other measuresincluded the provision of instructions to adhere to strict cadreassessment and approval procedures and to verifybudgetary availability of provisions before filling thevacancies and improving cash management through thetransfer of public servants’ loans and advances to thebanking system.

On the public debt management front, measures weretaken to diversify and broad base the governmentsecurities market, strengthen the Primary Dealer (PDs)system, phase out non-marketable debt instruments,while resorting more on domestic foreign currencydenominated commercial borrowings. With a view tobroadening the investor base and increasing the marketcompetition, the Rupee denominated Treasury bond marketwas opened to foreign investors. Accordingly, foreigninvestors were allowed to invest up to 5 per cent of theoutstanding amount of Treasury bonds. Furthermore, theminimum capital requirement applicable to PDs wasincreased further to Rs.300 million from Rs.250 million toprovide a cushion for the rising market risk. With a view tomaintaining adequate capital levels to cover PDs risks, theRisk Weighted Capital Adequacy Framework wasintroduced. The government continued its policy of retiringRupee securities to phase them out. In this regard, therestructuring bonds of commercial banks that matured in2006 were replaced with Treasury bonds. The governmentalso resorted more to domestic foreign currencydenominated commercial borrowings with a view todiversifying the domestic debt’s high exposure to risingdomestic interest rates.

Post tsunami reconstruction and development activitieswere continued by the government during the yearunder Reconstruction and Development Agency(RADA), the agency that was established in 2005 byincorporating all tsunami reconstruction relatedorganisations to accelerate reconstruction anddevelopment activities. The agency played an importantrole in coordinating housing programmes such as relocationof houses and the home owner driven housing programme.The livelihood restoring programmes were also coordinatedby RADA.The activities in other relevant sectors such aseducation, health, road and bridges, water supply andsanitation, power supply, ports, postal and telecommunications were handled by the relevent line Ministriesand departments.

Measures focused on the development of social andeconomic infrastructure facilities, creation ofemployment and income generating opportunities forthe poor and minimisation of regional imbalances indevelopment were implemented with a view of achievingthe pro-poor and pro-growth development objectivesof the government and revitalising the rural economy.Accordingly, a considerable amount of resources was spentto implement a series of projects and programmes to addressthe gaps in the economically less affluent segments toaccelerate economic and social progress, and therebyreduce poverty in a sustainable manner. In line with this, anumber of projects were implemented mainly in five major

areas: roads, electricity, irrigation and water, housing andlivelihood. The development of community water supply,upgrading rural roads, rural electrification, development ofrural irrigation facilities, provision of housing facilities for therural poor, special area and community based developmentprojects were integral parts of these projects. Specialattention was also given to rebuilding the conflict affectedareas through rehabilitation and reconstruction of basicinfrastructure facilities in those areas, and resettlement andsupport of the livelihood of people affected by the conflict.The empowerment of the rural poor was also attemptedthrough promoting socio-economic activities for Samurdhibeneficiaries. In addition, increased resources werechannelled to the poorest 119 Divisional Secretariat Divisionsto accelerate their development activities. The economicopportunities for the poor segments were expected to beenhanced through encouraging their entrepreneurship.

The government presented a comprehensive publicinvestment programme, particularly aimed ataddressing infrastructure bottlenecks that hamper thegrowth prospects of the country. During the year, prioritywas given to accelerate the project implementation withincreased utilisation of available foreign resources. In linewith this, efforts were continued to reduce procurementdelays and expedite reimbursement of funds. Maininvestment areas included power, roads, transport, airports,ports, communication, water supply, sewerage and housing.

Efforts to improve the financial performance of publicenterprises through SEMA were continued in 2006 asthe government has recognised the importance ofcontinuing state ownership of strategically importantenterprises. The scope of SEMA was expanded by aPresidential Directive during the year under which 8 newstrategic enterprises1 were brought into the purview ofSEMA. Furthermore, SEMA obtained Cabinet approval tocontinue its functions independently. In 2006, the enterprisesunder SEMA were grouped into five clusters namely,banking, transport and logistics, plantation, trading andutility2. Furthermore, measures were initiated by SEMA togenerate multi-purpose revenue sources in each enterprise

by using their available resources. New business modelsfor all strategic enterprises were prepared to find out newincome sources and thereby increase their contribution togovernment non-tax revenue.

In 2006, the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP)introduced several measures aimed at improvinggovernment finance operations. Accordingly, a FiscalPolicy Committee was set up at the MOFP to formulate fiscalpolicy framework for the country, monitor fiscal performanceand ensure discipline in the preparation of the Budgetthrough a constant review process. In addition, aGovernment Asset Management System (GAMS) wasintroduced to provide a monitoring mechanism fordisbursement and recovery of lending activities of thegovernment. Final steps were also being taken to introducea modified Single Accounting System on Treasury operationsto improve the management of government funds.

6.3 Government Budgetary Operations

Revenue

Total government revenue in 2006 increased by 26 percent to Rs. 477 billion, while the total revenue to GDPratio continued its increasing trend and reached 17.0per cent compared to 16.1 per cent in 2005. Total revenuewas only marginally below the target of Rs. 484.4 billion inthe original budget. The improved performance wasattributed to increase in revenue from both tax and non-taxrevenue.

Tax revenue increased by 27 per cent to Rs.428.4 billionand the tax revenue to GDP ratio increased for the thirdconsecutive year amounting to 15.3 per cent comparedto 14.2 per cent in 2005. The increase in tax revenue wasmainly driven by increases in revenue from income taxes,Value Added Tax (VAT), excise taxes and import duties.Revisions introduced to both corporate and personal income

tax rates, restrictions imposed on carry forward losses,closing loopholes through amendments to tax legislations,revisions introduced to the Economic Service Charge (ESC)and improved tax administration and enforcementcontributed to increased revenue from income taxes. Therevenue from VAT was increased due to increase in themark-up on imports, rate increase on financial services,increased imports of high valued items such as motorvehicles, high international commodity prices, growth inservices sector, particularly the telecommunication sub-sector, and measures introduced to streamline VAT refunds.The increase in revenue from excise duties was mainly due

to increase in cigarette sales and liquor production and rateincreases. The revenue from import duties increased dueto higher motor vehicle imports, intensified countervailingmeasures and improved surveillance, valuation methods andenforcement of SLC.

Non-tax revenue increased by 14.0 per cent to Rs.49billion though as a per cent of GDP, it declinedmarginally to 1.7 per cent in 2006 from 1.8 per cent in2005. This was achieved mainly due to the increase in salesand charges, fines and penalties, profits and dividends frompublic enterprises, and interest income received from loansto government corporations.

Expenditure

Total expenditure and net lending of the government in2006 reached Rs.713 billion recording a 22 per centincrease compared to the previous year. This was lowerthan the total expenditure of Rs. 731.6 billion expected in

the original budget for 2006. Higher than budgetedexpenditure on non-interest recurrent expenditure includingsalaries and wages, pensions and subsidies and transfersresulted in an overrun in total recurrent expenditure in 2006.Expenditure on salaries and wages increased by 26.3 percent to Rs.175 billion mainly due to the increase of publicsector salaries in 2006, correction of salary anomalies,introduction of a monthly cost of living allowance for publicservants, new recruitment of nurses, clerical staff, technicalstaff and home guards and the full impact of recruitment ofover 40,000 graduates to the public service. It was thehighest single expenditure item, which accounted for 32 percent of the total recurrent expenditure. Correction of pensionanomalies and the increase granted in 2006 were attributedfor the increase in pension payments by 24 per cent to Rs.58billion. Salary increases, inadequate revisions inadministered prices and inefficiencies in some publiccorporations led to increased current transfers to publiccorporations and institutions to Rs.39 billion in 2006 fromRs.26.5 billion in 2005. Meanwhile, interest payments, innominal terms, grew by 25.5 per cent compared to the

previous year. Domestic interest payments increased by18 per cent to Rs. 133.8 billion while foreign interestpayments increased by 143 per cent to Rs. 17 billioncompared to 2005. High interest payments on domestic debtand the increase in interest payments on foreign debt dueto the ending of the debt moratorium granted in 2005 werethe reasons for this increase. As a per cent of GDP alsointerest payments rose to 5.4 per cent from 5.1 per cent in2005.

There is an oppotunity cost involded in higher recurrentexpenditure. The incurrance of recurrent expenditure over

and above the target reduces the resources available forpublic investment that would lead to higher economic growthin the future.

Public investment continued with a view to improvingthe economic and social infrastructure in the country.

Public Private Partnershipsfor Infrastructure Development

The government is involved in providing “public”goods and services such as maintaining the law and orderand controlling pollution. The government is alsoinvolved in providing goods and services, particularlyeconomic and social infrastructure facilities, that need alarge initial capital and entails a large gestation period.To finance those projects, the government has beenregularly borrowing from various lending agencies suchas Asian Development Bank (ADB), World Bank andJapan Bank for International Co-operation (JBIC) andother bilateral sources as well as from commercialsources through Sri Lanka Development Bonds,borrowings from Offshore Banking Units andinternational capital markets.

The continuation of the existing practice ofborrowing to finance government infrastructure projectstends to widen the budget deficit and increase outstandinggovernment debt. If those projects are implementedsolely by the public sector they tend to suffer from typicalpublic sector ailments such as rent seeking and principalagent problem. Hence, there is a need for an alternativestrategy to finance and operate infrastructuredevelopment projects.

In a Private Public Partnership (PPP), the privatesector investors, foreign or domestic, join hands with thegovernment through a “partnership” arrangement toundertake development projects. The government couldcontribute to the arrangement by investing in land andproviding licences, safeguards and sovereign guarantees,facilitating the fund raising processes and creating anenabling environment. The private sector could undertakepart of financing and implementation and operation ofthe project.

PPPs are fast becoming a popular method offinancing infrastructure projects in developing andemerging market economies. According to Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) during1990-2004, South Asia’s 224 infrastructure projects withprivate participation attracted about US dollars 55.4billion in investment commitments compared to leadingPPP regions such as Latin America and East Asia whereinvestment commitments amounted to about US dollars400 billion and US dollars 200 billion, respectively. Indiaaccounted for 76 per cent of South Asia’s activity. TableB 8.1 lists a few PPP projects in Asian countries.

The proposed Colombo Port Expansion Project(CPEP) is one of the recent examples of the PPP modelbeing used in Sri Lanka. The major elements of the CPEPare dredging an approach channel and inner harbour basin

and the construction of a breakwater sufficient toaccommodate three new terminals. The terminals are tobe constructed by operators chosen through opencompetitive bidding under a build-operate-transfer (BOT)concession agreement. The civil works will be carriedout by the government through the Sri Lanka PortsAuthority (SLPA). The project cost is estimated at USdollars 1,406 million including the construction of threeterminals. Total investment cost of the initial phase ofthe CPEP is estimated at US dollars 781 million, whichincludes the construction of a terminal. Of the total coston initial phase, the public sector component is estimatedat US dollars 480 million, which is to be financed by aloan of US dollars 300 million from ADB and the balanceby the government of Sri Lanka. Potential private sectorinvestors for the private sector component of US dollars301 million are to be identified.

The above example highlights the benefits accruingto the country through PPPs. If this entire project wereto be financed through the government budget, it wouldwiden the budget deficit, increase the government’sborrowing and the outstanding debt creating difficultiesin fiscal management and severely impacting on inflation.The projects implemented under PPPs are a future sourceof government revenue by way of dividends and capitalgains. The comparative advantage of the private investorsto manage projects will lead to increased efficiency,productivity and higher quality. A properly designed andexecuted PPP enhances access to international finance,increases competitiveness of service delivery, enablespooling of diverse risk profiles and promotes technologydevelopment.

and higher utilisation of foreign resources were the majorcontributory factors to increased public investment. Totalpublic investment in 2006 includes the expenditure incurredon the reconstruction of infrastructure damaged due to thetsunami disaster. As a per cent of GDP, public investmentremained at 6.3 per cent as in 2005.

The economic services continued to be the major areaof public investment. Transport and communication andenergy and water supply were the major sub-sectors in thiscategory as in the pervious years. In line with thegovernment’s continuous focus on pro-poor, livelihood andregional development activities, a large amount of fundswere also spent on rural infrastructure development.Furthermore, mega projects such as the Southern Highwayproject and Bandaranaike International Airport developmentproject were among the key infrastructure developmentprojects in progress.

Public investment in social services increased in 2006reflecting the government’s high priority for overallhuman resource development with emphasis oneducation and health sectors. The share of social servicessector within the total public investment was 27 percent in2006. Investments in education were mainly on developmentof human resources and improvement of schoolinfrastructure. Health sector investments were directedtowards the improvement of general health services andhospital services while providing high tech medicalequipment.

Key Fiscal Balances

The overall budget deficit in 2006 was Rs. 235.8 billionand amounted to 8.4 per cent of GDP. This was lowerthan the deficit of 9.1 per cent of GDP planned in the originalBudget. This was a result of the higher decline in capitalexpenditure and net lending than the overrun in recurrentexpenditure. The current account deficit (government dis-

savings) as a per cent of GDP declined to 2.5 per cent in2006 from 2.7 per cent in 2005 showing the impact ofimproved revenue though there was an overrun in recurrentexpenditure. The primary deficit (overall deficit net of interestpayments) declined to 3.0 per cent of GDP in 2006 from 3.6per cent in 2005 as the increase in revenue outpaced theincrease in non-interest expenditure. In 2006, the increasein total revenue was 26 per cent while the increase in non-interest expenditure was 21 per cent.

Financing the Budget Deficit

The budget deficit of Rs.235.8 billion was largelyfinanced through domestic sources in 2006. Total netdomestic financing (NDF) was Rs.164 billion compared tothe original target of Rs.123 billion while net foreign financing(NFF) was Rs.72 billion (net foreign loans of Rs.42 billionand foreign grants of Rs.30 billion) compared with the originaltarget of Rs.124.2 billion. Higher than expected NDF ledthe government to rely more on borrowings from the bankingsystem. As a per cent of GDP, total NDF increased to 5.8per cent from 5.2 per cent in 2005 while NFF declined to 2.6per cent from 3.4 per cent of GDP in 2005. In 2006, theDebt Dependency Ratio (the ratio of total net borrowings tototal government expenditure) declined to 28.8 per cent from29.3 per cent in 2005.

In financing the overall deficit, 51 per cent of the NDFor Rs.84 billion (3 per cent of GDP) was raised fromdomestic non-bank sources. Total financing from non-banksources in 2006 recorded a decline of Rs.9 billion from Rs.93billion in 2005. The Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) wasthe major source of non-bank financing as in the previousyears.

Government borrowings from the banking systemaccounted for 49 per cent of the NDF. In 2006 Total bank

continued to be the major lenders of project loans accountingfor 38 per cent, 20.3 per cent and 14.3 per cent of the totalproject loans, respectively. Total foreign loans also includedthe two foreign commercial loans totalling US dollars 150million (Rs.16 billion), which were raised in November (USdollars 50 million) and December (US dollars 100 million)2006 as syndicated loans with a view to reducing thepressure on the domestic debt securities market and tostabilising the domestic interest rate structure.

Net financing through foreign loans declined in 2006.Net foreign borrowings declined to Rs.41.9 billion in 2006from Rs.47.8 billion in 2005. This was due to higher foreignamortisation payments of Rs.45.9 billion in 2006 comparedto the lower foreign amortisation payments of Rs.21.4 billionrecorded in 2005 as a result of the deferment of a part ofthe foreign amortisation payments under the debtmoratorium granted by foreign lenders.

Foreign grants received in 2006 declined marginally toRs.30.0 billion from Rs. 32.6 billion in 2005. Bilaterallenders such as Japan and the USA and multilateral lenderssuch as ADB, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF),United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Foodand Agricultural Organisation (FAO) were the major lendersof foreign grants.

Financing the budget deficit could have seriousmacroeconomic implications. If the deficit was highlyfinanced through domestic sources, It would crowed outprivate investment. Borrowings from domestic bankingsystem will create inflationary pressures in the economy.High foreign non-concessional borrowings could increasethe vulnerability of the external sector to various shocks.Hence, to minimise these macroeconomic implications, aproper balance has to be maintained in the borrowing mixto finance the budget deficit.

6.4 Sub National Government BudgetaryOperations

The sub national government (SNGs) system in SriLanka consists of Provincial Councils (PCs) and LocalGovernments (LGs). There are 9 PCs that have beenestablished under the 13th Amendment to the Constitutionin the process of decentralisation of the decision makingprocess by the devolution of powers to PCs. A total of 330units comprising 18 Municipal Councils (MCs), 40 UrbanCouncils (UCs) and 272 Pradesheeya Sabhas (PSs)constituted the local government system in the country asat end 2006.

In rendering the services assigned to them, SNGs faceda number of problems. The key problems were inadequatepowers to mobilise resources, the large gap betweenrevenue and expenditure of provinces making highlydependent upon transfers from the central government to

borrowings amounted to Rs.80 billion (2.9 percent of GDP)in 2006 compared to Rs.26.2 billion (1.1 per cent of GDP)in 2005. Borrowings from the Central Bank and commercialbanks in 2006 amounted to Rs.39 billion and Rs.41 billion,respectively.

The government relied increasingly on foreign currencydenominated domestic borrowings for budgetaryfinancing as a measure of minimising pressure ondomestic market interest rates and diversifying theinstruments to reduce interest cost. The total value ofSri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) issued in 2006 wasUS dollars 580 million in which a part of the proceeds wasutilised to repay maturing SLDBs of US dollars 250 million.There were borrowings from Offshore Banking Units (OBUs)of US dollars 305 million with repayments of US dollars 241million resulting in a net borrowing of US dollars 64 million.In addition, some loans due to OBUs in 2006 were rolledover.

Net domestic borrowings through debt instrumentsincreased to Rs.128.2 billion in 2006 from Rs.74.5 billionin 2005. The net contribution of the domestic debtinstruments to the domestic financing mainly came fromTreasury bonds (Rs.97.4 billion), Treasury bills (Rs.20.3billion) and SLDBs (Rs.34.2 billion) as there was a netrepayment of Rupee loans (Rs.23.8 billion). Treasury bondsamounting to Rs.16 billion, issued on two occasions in 2006to the two state banks to securitise a part of outstandingoverdrafts and the conversion of the matured restructuringbonds of state banks into Treasury bonds were alsocontributed to the increase in net borrowings from debtinstruments.

The maturity structure of the instrument based rupeeborrowings was more towards the shorter end of themarket reflecting the investor preference. The risinginterest rate structure fuelled by rising inflation and highinflation expectations coupled with the uncertainty thatprevailed particularly during the second half of the year werethe major factors that shifted the investor preference to theshorter end of the market.

Total non-instrument borrowings declined to Rs.36billion in 2006 from Rs.49.1 billion in 2005. This includedborrowings through provisional advances (Rs.9.2 billion),overdrafts (Rs.23.7 billion), and borrowings from OBUs(Rs.6.9 billion). Non-instrument borrowings amounted to22 per cent of the total NDF in 2006 compared to 40 percent in 2005.

In 2006, gross foreign loans received for budgetaryfinancing increased by 29 per cent. On gross basis, thegovernment was able to disburse Rs.97.6 billion (US dollars912.5 million) through foreign loans compared to Rs.75.2billion (US dollars 746.3 million) in the previous year.

finance the resource gap, lack of a strong institutionalframework that has resulted in a weak relationship with thecentral government, lack of technical skills and inadequatefinancial and human resource management. Therefore, theycontinued to function largely as administrative arms of thecentral government rather than devolved fiscal structures.

The Ministry of Local Government and ProvincialCouncils (MLGP) continued to maintain a closecoordination with SNGs. The MLGP provided guidanceand assistance to SNGs to ensure good governance,promote access to management support, improve servicedelivery and achieve development objectives of SNGs whilecontinuing to play an important role in the tsunami recoveryprocess.

The Finance Commission (FC) continued its key role ofrecommending apportionment of available resourcesamong PCs. In this process, socio-economic indicators ofthe provinces (such as population of each province and percapita income of each province etc.) were considered ascriteria for apportioning resources. The role of the FC needsto be more pro-active by promoting the utilisation of availableresources in the regions to address regional economicdisparities.

Performance of Provincial Councils

The overall budgetary operations of PCs improvedmarginally in 2006. The increased revenue of PCs wasmainly due to the increase in revenue from turnover taxesand stamp duties. About 72 per cent of the total revenuewas collected from these two sources. Western ProvincialCouncil (WPC) continued as the dominant revenue collectingprovince and accounted for 68 per cent of the total revenue

collection. High concentration of commercial and industrialactivities and the high population in the WPC was attributedto the higher revenue collection of the WPC. The Central,Southern and North Western Provinces were the other majorrevenue collecting PCs.

The relatively higher recurrent expenditure of PCs thanthe revenue was mainly attributed to higher expenditureon salaries and wages. Of the total recurrent expenditure,the major portion (79 per cent) was on personal emoluments.The education (69 per cent) and health (21 per cent) sectorsabsorbed the major portions of personal emoluments.

The expenditure incurred by the investment programmeof PCs increased in 2006. The investment programmeconsisted of the Province Specific Development Projects(PSDP) and foreign funded special projects. There was anincrease in the central government transfers to PCs in termsof block grants, criteria based grants, matching grants, andProvince Specific Development Grants (PSDG) to Rs.71billion from Rs.54 billion in 2005. Foreign grants receivedfor special projects amounted to Rs.8 billion.

There is a need for PCs to become more pro-active intheir activities. In particular, the use of their own resourceshas to be improved without depending more on the centralgovernment to fill their resource gap. PCs also could taketheir own initiatives to attract investments to infrustructuredevelopment and various other improvements.

Performance of Local Governments

The LGs continued to perform the functions assignedto them despite a number of constraints. The devolvedrevenue and transfers from the central government wereused to finance their operations. In collecting some of thedevolved revenues such as property transfer taxes and courtfines as assigned under the 13th Amendment to theConstitution, PCs worked as the agent for LGs. The outlaysof LGs comprised personal emoluments, other currentexpenses and capital expenses. The effective functioningof LGs has been hampered by weak financial systems, lackof efficient human resource management systems, lack ofcompetent technical staff, lack of strong regulation andmonitoring systems.

6.5 Financial Performance of Selected PublicEnterprises

The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and CeylonPetroleum Corporation (CPC) continued to be the twopublic enterprises which are still posing a significantburden on government fiscal operations. In 2006, thefinancial position of CEB deteriorated further while CPC’sfinancial position did not show a noteworthy improvement.

Despite the increase in low cost hydro power generationand tariff adjustments in 2006, the financial position ofCEB deteriorated due to a number of factors. Theseinclude the inflexible pricing policy, increased fuel cost,

delays in implementation of planned reforms in the electricitysector, delays in implementation of planned low cost large-scale power projects and the delay in addressing the highsystem losses. The continuation of the operating losses ofCEB will lead to increase its liabilities to the banking systemleading to adverse monetary implications. It has also led toadverse fiscal implications as the government is servicingCEB’s foreign debt.

Several factors were attributed to the less favourablefinancial position of CPC in 2006. These include thedelays in price adjustments during July and August and netloss of oil refinery during the latter part of the year. However,CPC continued to improve its financial management andinternal controls while importing refined products on a morecompetitive basis and negotiating more favourable termson supplier’s credit. Furthermore, it also entered into hedgingpart of its oil purchases for the first time in early 2007 withthe view of maintaining stable retail prices and fuel cardswere introduced to assure the market share. Though thecredit facility obtained under the Indian Line of Credit in 2005shifted a part of the CPC’s short-term liabilities to mediumto long term liabilities, high short-term liabilities continuedto be a concern.

6.6 Public Sector Debt and Debt ServicePayments

Government Debt

The government total outstanding debt increased by 17per cent to Rs.2,606.5 billion as at end 2006, but as aper cent of GDP, it declined to 93 per cent from 93.9 percent as at end 2005. The lower debt to GDP ratio was dueto the relatively higher growth in nominal GDP than thegrowth in the outstanding debt.

Of the total debt, 56.7 per cent was domestic debt(Rs.1,475.5 billion) while 43.3 per cent was foreign debt(Rs.1,131.0 billion). The corresponding shares in 2005 were56.9 per cent and 43.1 per cent, respectively. The domesticdebt to GDP ratio was 52.6 per cent while foreign debt toGDP ratio was 40.4 per cent in 2006 compared to 53.5 percent and 40.4 per cent, respectively in the previous year.

Total outstanding debt, in nominal terms, increased byRs. 384.2 billion in 2006 compared to the increase ofRs. 82.8 billion in 2005. Total domestic debt increased byRs.209.8 billion and total foreign debt increased by Rs.174.4billion. The increase in foreign debt was mainly due todepreciation of the rupee vis-à-vis major foreign currencies.The impact of exchange rate variation in 2006 was anincrease of the foreign debt by Rs.108.6 billion. In contrast,there was a decline in the foreign debt by Rs.100.7 billion in2005 due to appreciation of the rupee. The higher increasein domestic debt was attributed to increased domesticborrowings, exchange rate variation in respect of foreigncurrency denominated domestic debt and the increased

difference between the face value and the book value ofTreasury bonds issued in 2006.

The share of medium and long-term debt in the totaldomestic debt stock declined marginally to 78.7 per centfrom 79.3 per cent in the previous year. Treasury bondsdominated the outstanding domestic debt portfolioaccounting for 60 per cent compared to 59.4 per cent in2005. In line with the policy of continuously reducing non-marketable debt, Rupee securities amounting to Rs.23.8billion were repaid in 2006. Consequently, the share ofRupee securities in the total domestic debt stock declinedto 7.9 per cent in 2006 from 24.3 per cent in 2003, 14 percent in 2004 and 11 per cent in 2005. Of the short-termdomestic debt, the share of Treasury bills declined to 81.8per cent in 2006 from 89 per cent in 2005 as the share ofother short-term borrowings was increased.

In 2006, total outstanding debt liabilities to the bankingsector increased by 21.6 per cent. As a share of totaloutstanding domestic debt, it increased to 24.6 per cent(8 per cent to the Central Bank and 16.6 per cent tocommercial banks) compared to 23.6 per cent in 2005. Theoutstanding foreign currency denominated domestic debtof the government, in which commercial banks are the majorsubscribers, increased to Rs.145 billion (US dollars 1,359million) in 2006 from Rs.98.5 billion (US dollars 965 million)in 2005. This consisted of borrowings from OBUs of Rs.83billion (US dollars 779 million) and SLDBs of Rs.62 billion(US dollars 580 million).

Total liabilities to the non-bank sector also increasedby 15 per cent. As a per cent of outstanding total domesticdebt, these liabilities accounted for 75.4 per cent. Majorcontributors were EPF and NSB accounting for 42 per cent(Rs.469 billion) and 15 per cent (Rs.166 billion) of the totalnon bank sector dedt, respectively.

The share of outstanding foreign concessional debt tothe total foreign debt declined to 92.4 per cent in 2006from 96.1 per cent in 2005. This decline was mainlyattributed to the increased foreign commercial borrowings.The outstanding bilateral debt increased to Rs. 508.8 billionin 2006 from Rs. 433.3 billion in 2005. The main bilaterallenders were Japan (27.1 per cent), the USA (5.1 per cent)and the Federal Republic of Germany (7.7 per cent). TheADB and IDA were the major multilateral lenders, whichaccounted for 23.9 per cent and 21.6 per cent of the foreigndebt, respectively.

The government debt to GDP ratio still remains highthough it indicated some improvement in the recentpast. High interest payments associated with highoutstanding debt provides only a limited room to manoeuvrefiscal operations thereby increasing the pressure on non-interest expenditure of the budget while reducingdevelopment oriented expenditure. Adverse implications onthe macroeconomic stability and decline in the country’sability to withstand against external shocks also are amongthe negative aspects of the high debt burden. This situation

underscores the necessity of intensifying the efforts in themedium to long run towards strengthening the fiscalconsolidation process to achieve the debt reduction paththat has already been announced by the government in itspolicy documents.

Non-Financial Public Corporation Debt

The total outstanding liabilities of non-financial publiccorporations (NFPC) to the banking system and theirlong term foreign liabilities increased by Rs. 14.7 billionin 2006. Total of these liabilities amounted to Rs.46.1 billionat end 2006 compared to Rs.31.3 billion in the previous year.Debt liabilities of NFPC to the banking system increased toRs.33.2 billion in 2006 from Rs.16.7 billion in 2005. TheCPC and CEB were the major debtors who accounted for83 per cent of the total outstanding liabilities to the bankingsystem amounting to Rs.17.2 billion and Rs.10.3 billion,respectively. Total outstanding NFPC debt included theremaining balance of Rs.12.9 billion (US dollars 120 million)of the credit line obtained by CPC from India in 2005.

Public Sector Debt

Total outstanding public sector debt, which includes thegovernment debt stock and liabilities of the NFPCs tothe banking system, increased by Rs. 399 billion toRs.2,652.6 billion at end 2006. The increases recorded inboth government’s debt by Rs.384.2 billion and NFPCs debtby Rs.14.6 billion contributed to this. As a per cent of GDP,the outstanding public sector debt declined marginally to94.7 per cent as at end 2006 from 95.3 per cent at end2005.

Debt Service Payments

In 2006, total debt service payments increased by 28.8per cent to Rs.444.3 billion. This consisted of amortisationpayments of Rs.293.5 billion (66 per cent) and interestpayments of Rs.150.8 billion (34 per cent). Debt servicepayments to domestic sources amounted to Rs. 381.3 billion

while that for foreign sources was Rs.63 billion. The regularforeign debt service programme was continued in 2006 asthe one-off decline in payments due to the debt moratoriumgranted by foreign lenders for 2005 was ended in November2005. The debt service payments in 2006 also included apart of the foreign interest and repayments deferred in 2005.

The debt service indicators reverted to the previouslevels in 2006 with the ending of debt moratorium.Nevertheless, a number of debt service indicators, includingtotal debt service payments to government revenue andexpenditure, improved compared to pre-tsunami levels.

the bunching of maturities has to be minimised through anappropriate machanism. It would help smoothen the maturityprofile of the domestic debt thereby, minimising the pressureon government fiscal operations. In addition, a long termyield curve also has to be established to develop debtsecurities market.
