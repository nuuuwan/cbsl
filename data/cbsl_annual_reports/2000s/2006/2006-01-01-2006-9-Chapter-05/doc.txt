5.1 OverviewSri Lanka’s external sectorcontinued to expand in themidst of many challenges in anenvironment where sustainedstrong global growth was alsoexperienced in 2006. TheBalance of Payments (BOP)recorded a surplus for thesecond consecutive year. TheForeign Direct Investment (FDI)reached a record high level in2006, surpassing the previouslyrecorded highest level in 1997.Sri Lanka’s exports continued togrow taking advantage of thehigher growth in its major exportdestinations, increased access toseveral selected markets underpreferential trading arrangementsand continuous efforts byexporters to penetrate into newand high value niche markets.Amidst intense global competition,the apparel exports exceeded USdollars 3 billion mark in 2006,

aided by increased access to the EU market under the GSP+scheme and continuous demand from USA .The rapid growthin regional countries boosted exports of services, especially,transshipment cargo handling and tourism. Though touristarrivals suffered a setback during the latter part of the year,the overall performance in terms of earnings during the yearshowed an improvement over the previous year. Workerremittances increased substantially for the secondconsecutive year. In the meantime, imports grew at anincreased rate due to higher international oil prices, andimports of investment goods. The exceptionally high oilprices experienced during the year led to a deterioration inthe terms of trade by 3.5 per cent. Reflecting thesedevelopments, the external official reserves improved,thereby strengthening the resilience of the external sectorto external shocks. The rupee depreciated by around 5.2per cent which was commensurate with the inflationdifference between Sri Lanka and its major trading partners,reducing the pressure in the foreign exchange market. Toattain the objectives of mitigating the impact of rising oilprices on the BOP, reducing volatility in the domestic foreignexchange market and protecting consumers from rising oilprices, the Central Bank took initiatives to encourage theCeylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) to enter into hedgingarrangements in relation to their oil purchases.

5.2 External Sector Policies and InstitutionalSupport

In 2006, international trade and finance continued tooperate in a free and liberal economic environmentunderpinned by full current account convertibility,limited capital account restrictions and a freely floatingexchange rate regime. In the midst of external anddomestic shocks, the free-market economic policies, thehealthy investment climate and improved payment systemhave enabled the country to achieve a higher growth inrecent years. External trade policy is aimed at productdiversification through enhancing competitiveness ofdomestic production and capturing new markets throughmutually beneficial trade and investment treaties.

The capital account was further opened in 2006 byproviding opportunities to foreign nationals to investin rupee denominated government Treasury bonds. Inaddition to available concessional financing, the governmentrequires more long-term foreign financing to implementmajor infrastructure projects, which are essential to promoteregionally balanced growth. Therefore, it is necessary forSri Lanka to establish its presence in the international capitalmarkets to fill its foreign financing gap, while being consciousof external debt sustainability. In this regard, the governmentopened the rupee denominated Treasury bond market forforeign investors with effect from 01 November 2006, up toa maximum limit of 5 per cent of the total value of Treasurybonds outstanding at any given point of time. Accordingly,

foreign investors including foreign country funds, mutualfunds and regional funds approved by the Securities andExchange Commission (SEC) of Sri Lanka, corporate bodiesincorporated outside Sri Lanka and citizens of foreign statesare now permitted to invest in rupee denominated Treasurybonds. In order to mitigate the risks arising from a suddenoutflow of funds, the Central Bank has teken action to builda Special Fund, denominated in US Dollars, out of whichany demand for foreign exchange for that purpose wouldbe met.

The continuation of trade liberalisation policy yieldeda lower average tariff rate of 4.2 per cent in 2006compared to 4.3 per cent in 2005. The main trade policyinstrument, the import tariff, comprised of a five-band tariffstructure of 0, 2.5, 6, 15 and 28 per cent in 2006. Accordingly,the government continued to maintain duty on basic rawmaterials at the lowest tariff band and apply middle andupper rates to intermediate and finished goods. Several duty

changes, particularly related to essential food items andnon-essential consumer items were made in 2006. Asprudential measures to deter imprudent lending for theimport of non-essential items, while promoting stability ofthe financial system, several of these items were broughtunder a margin deposit of 50 per cent at the time of openingletters of credit and before releasing documents onDocument against Acceptance (DA terms) in 2006. The othercharges applicable to imports in 2006 were surcharge oncustoms duty (10% of customs duty), Value Added Tax(VAT), Port and Airport Development Levy (PAL), SocialResponsibility Levy (SRL), Excise Duty (for alcohol, tobaccoproducts and vehicles) and cess on non-essential consumeritems.

Economic Implications and Prerequisites for FurtherOpening of the Capital AccountBox 6

Capital account opening is the process in which acountry moves from a closed capital account regime, wherecapital may not move freely in and out of the country to anopen capital account regime, where capital enters andleaves freely. Opening the capital account generallypromotes economic growth, facilitates risk sharing throughportfolio diversifications and results in efficiency gains.Several emerging market economies have relaxed andremoved restrictions on capital transactions and liberaliseddomestic financial markets, given the need for investmentneeds arising from insufficient domestic savings. However,financial crises have also been reported in a number ofcountries after the opening of the capital account, not dueto the weaknesses of the concept per se, but due to theprevalence of a weak banking and financial sector, lack ofproper prudential regulations and poor supervision.

Sri Lanka permitted the movement of capital inflowsand outflows selectively in 1978. Inward FDI and portfolioinvestments were freely permitted, subject to existingregulations to attract foreign direct investments needed forexport-oriented industrialisation, financing the wideningsavings-investment gap and helping domestic companiesto expand their production capacity with low cost fundsfrom foreign lenders. At the same time, as a risk mitigationmechanism, outward investments and foreign borrowingsby Sri Lankans were permitted only on a case-by-case basisdepending on the merits of each case. Benefiting from thesepolicy changes, gross FDI inflows increased to US dollars49 million in 1979. This trend continued thereafter,eventually reaching US dollars 604 million in 2006.Consequently, the country’s industrial base and export base

have diversified and expanded over the years, and atpresent all enterprises approved by the Board of Investment(BOI) account for about 73 per cent of total exports of thecountry and for 89 per cent of total industrial exports.Nearly 400,000 people are directly employed in BOIapproved enterprises and a large number of people areindirectly employed in related sectors. The portfolioinvestment inflows also have been increasing gradually,which reached a record level of US dollars 354 million in2006. Along with these favourable developments, othertrade related services such as port services, and financialservices also expanded substantially.

Further opening up the capital account has beensuggested as being a means to facilitate economic growthfurther through promoting higher investment byminimising cost of equity capital and debt and improvingthe efficiency of the financial system through greatercompetition and to provide opportunities for Sri Lankaninvestors to expand their operations both locally andabroad. It is also claimed that this situation has been furtherintensified with Sri Lanka graduating to now being acountry with a middle-income country status andimposition of limitations on concessional financingavailable to the country. Meanwhile, some of the domesticprivate sector enterprises with overseas investments havedemonstrated the capability of local entrepreneurs tocompete successfully in international markets. Asfinancing needs of the government has exceeded officialexternal financing over the years, it has become necessaryfor the government to resort to syndicated loans andexternal commercial borrowings on a modest scale. Even

some of the private sector enterprises currently resort toforeign borrowings, as it is cheaper to borrow abroad.Some of these companies have already demonstrated theirability to raise capital from international markets throughinternational bond issues and loans. These developmentsindicate the potential for other viable companies tomobilise funds at relatively low cost from internationalmarkets.

Recent measures in opening the capital account

In 2006, towards further opening of the capital account,the government permitted foreign country funds, regionalfunds or mutual funds approved by the Securities andExchange Commission of Sri Lanka, corporate bodiesincorporated outside Sri Lanka and citizens of foreigncountries to purchase and hold up to 5 per cent of the totaloutstanding value of Rupee Denominated Treasury Bondsat any given point of time. During the year, thegovernment also issued foreign currency denominatedNation Building Bonds for non-resident Sri Lankans andSri Lankan professionals living in Sri Lanka or abroadwho earn income in foreign currency. These measuresare expected to benefit the economy in several ways. Thegovernment’s borrowing cost may reduce throughcompetitive bidding from both foreign and domesticinvestors. In addition, a country may receive foreignexchange through bond issues, which would increaseofficial reserves of the country, further strengthening thecountry’s resilience to external shocks. However, theseinflows should be prudentially invested and managed toeffectively overcome any unforeseen events, which maylead to sudden capital outflows. These measures may alsofacilitate the country’s efforts to mobilise funds in theinternational capital markets by increasing foreigninvestors’ appetite for investment in Sri Lankan debtinstruments. Table B 6.1 compares the present position ofselected capital account restrictions in Sri Lanka and India.

Potential areas for future opening

Though inward foreign direct investments are freelypermitted, foreign investment is not permitted in certainbusinesses such as money lending, pawn broking, coastalfishing and retail trade with a capital of less than US dollars1 million. In some cases, there are restrictions on foreignownership (permitted only up to 40 per cent of issued sharecapital) in certain businesses.1 There are a few other areas,

which strictly require the approval of the relevant lineministries due to security and environmental concerns.2

While these limitations may continue, potential areas forfurther relaxation may include outward foreign directinvestments, listing of shares in foreign share markets andforeign borrowings by companies incorporated in SriLanka, foreign investment by long-term funds, listing theshares of companies incorporated outside Sri Lanka in theColombo Stock Exchange and permission for non-residentsto subscribe to debt instruments of local companies. Therelevant authorities may examine these potential areasfurther and respond appropriately in time to come.

Prerequisites for further capital account opening

At the same time, considering the dangers of greater capitalflows including the impact on the domestic financialsystem, exchange rate volatility, competitiveness andcomplication of macroeconomic management, it is essentialto carefully consider some basic preconditions beforemoving towards such policies. These would include theconvergence of domestic interest rates towards globalinterest rates to narrow the interest rate differentials, whichwill lower speculative capital flows, and encourage long-term capital flows. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain alow and stable inflation in the country. Sound and properregulatory framework with effective enforcementmechanism and enhanced risk management practicesshould also be put in place prior to opening further to avoidfuture financial crisis. It is also necessary to prepare a clearroadmap for sequencing the process based on a carefulexamination of the effectiveness of the prevailing regulatoryframework, the macroeconomic conditions in the countryand health of corporate, banking and other financialinstitutions.

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report 2006

Being a small economy with limited domestic demand,Sri Lanka does not have a choice but to adopt externaltrade relations and policies aimed at enhancing theintegration of domestic economy with global markets.It would help the country to reap benefits of ever increasingglobal demand, technological developments, and thetransfer of skills and knowledge. Sri Lanka remains firmlycommitted to the multilateral trading system and continuedto participate actively in free trade negotiations initiated bythe World Trade Organisation (WTO).

Sri Lanka made progress in furthering its regional andbilateral trading arrangements in 2006. In the regionalfront, the first phase of trade liberalisation under SAFTAwas introduced in July, 2006. After the accession of Chinain 2001, the six member Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement(APTA), formerly known as Bangkok Agreement, initiated aprocess to revitalise the agreement. The tariff concessionsoffered under bilateral trade agreements by way of tariffeliminations and tariff reductions helped withstand the stronginternational competition and maintain the growthmomentum in the external sector in the post Multi-Fibre

Arrangement (MFA) era. As per the second phase of tariffliberalisation under the Indo-Sri Lanka Free TradeAgreement (ISLFTA), Sri Lanka has been subject to zeroduty on all goods from Sri Lanka, except for the items in thenegative list since March, 2003. However, Sri Lanka’sexports to India were largely concentrated on a few items.Sri Lanka also reduced its tariff by 70 per cent in 2006 for allgoods from India except for the items in the negative list.Two way trade between Sri Lanka and India increased by11 per cent to US dollars 2.7 billion in 2006. Two rounds oftechnical level negotiations under the ComprehensiveEconomic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) were held in 2006.These negotiations were on trade in goods and services,trade in financial services, air services, investment, treatmentof double taxation and economic cooperation. Both countriesstressed the need to conclude the ongoing negotiationtowards its fast implementation before the end 2007 in amutually beneficial manner. Under the Pakistan-Sri LankaFree Trade Agreement, a 67 per cent tariff reduction wasalso received on Sri Lankan exports to Pakistan in 2006.Exports to Pakistan increased significantly by 46 per centreflecting higher performance in categories such as fruits,tea, rubber, coconut and wood products.

Tariff concessions granted under the GSP+ (GeneralisedSystem of Preferences) scheme helped to diversifyexports and markets in the European Union (EU) region.Despite intense competition, apparel exports to the EUincreased by 17.3 per cent mainly on account of the GSP+tariff concessions. However, due to rigid and complex rulesof origin (ROO) criteria, Sri Lanka’s utilisation rate ofconcessions of apparel was low in 2006. At the request ofthe Government, the European Commission set up a studyteam to carry out an impact assessment on the change ofROO under the GSP+ scheme. The current GSP+ schemeis scheduled to be reviewed by the EU in December, 2008.

The government continued to support the exportersusing a wide spectrum of arrangements. Major institutionsinvolved in this exercise were the Board of Investment (BOI),Sri Lanka Export Development Board (SLEDB), Sri LankaExport Credit Insurance Corporation (SLECIC) and Sri LankaStandards Institution (SLSI). The Bureau of Indian Standards(BIS) and SLSI entered into a bilateral cooperationagreement in August, 2006 to facilitate trade between thetwo countries through standardisation, quality control andcertification of products.

A number of initiatives have been taken by thegovernment aimed at increasing the competitivenessof the textiles and apparel sector to enable it towithstand the emerging pressure. These include thereduction of the VAT for local suppliers of intermediate goods,duty free concessions to acquire advanced technology,financial assistance for technology improvements, simplifiedVAT applications, a zero rate VAT structure for garment

buying offices, establishment of the College of Textiles andClothing and reopening of defunct textiles units to facilitatevertical integration of the garment industry. Given the strongcompetition in the international market, renewed interest ofmajor exporters to invest heavily in the defunct units augurswell for the industry’s future and is indicative of a broadersense of growing confidence. Apparel industry has gearedup to making a major breakthrough in the internationalmarket with the launch of their new campaign titled“Garments without Guilt”. The industry increased its focuson being an ethical supplier of garments empowering womenwhilst refraining from employing child labour. The purposeof this campaign is to prepare the industry to meet theinternational competition when various restrictions placed

by the USA and the EU on Chinese garment exports areremoved in 2008.

in 2006, which was the combined outcome of improvedprices and volumes.

The composition of exports remained almostunchanged in 2006 compared to the previous year.Industrial exports grew by 8.8 per cent in 2006. Despitethe intense global competition, apparel exports grew by 6.4per cent in 2006. Although apparel exports to the USAdeclined marginally, exports to the EU including apparelincreased significantly by 18.4 per cent partly capitalisingthe concessions offered by the GSP+ scheme. The growthin the EU was reflected in the expansion of market share inthe UK, Italy, Germany, France and the Netherlands.Although the exports of rubber based products increasedin 2006, the sector was affected by high and aggressivefluctuations in the prices of raw materials. Food andbeverage exports, which increased remarkably in 2005,were affected by the reduction in exports of vanaspathi toIndia in 2006. Agricultural exports were largely led by higherperformance of tea and rubber in 2006. With a record-settingperformance, tea exports benefited from supply shortagesin the international markets due to the drought in Kenyaand a greater demand from the CIS and the Middle Eastcountries. However, the value added tea exports declinedin 2006, mainly due to lower exports to Jordan, Iraq and

Libya. Rubber exports too increased in 2006 reflectingincreases in both prices and volumes. The price of rubberrose to historically high levels in 2006 on account ofescalating oil prices. However, the price of natural rubberwas highly volatile in the international markets during 2006,responding to oil prices, weather patterns, actions of hedgefunds, demand from major buyers, global production andinventories. Other agricultural exports increased reflectinghigher exports of fruits, pepper, cinnamon andunmanufactured tobacco. The external demand for theseproducts was stimulated by the duty free access to the Indianmarket under the ISLFTA and the growing demand from theMiddle Eastern countries.

Import Performance

Imports grew by 15.7 per cent to US dollars 10,253million in 2006, reflecting both increased demand andhigher import prices. The expansion of manufacturing andprocessing activities, ever expanding demand for consumerdurables, and the relatively low interest rate regimecontributed to raise import demand for all three categories,viz., intermediate, investment and consumer goods, in 2006.

Intermediate goods imports, which is dominated bypetroleum products, grew by 12.1 per cent in 2006. Asharp increase in the intermediate goods imports during thefirst three quarters was led mainly by higher expenditure onpetroleum imports. During this period, the average price ofcrude oil increased by 32.8 per cent. However, as a result

20.0 per cent of the overall imports, increased by 25.0 percent to US dollars 2,070 million in 2006 from US dollars1,655 million in 2005. Meanwhile, the non-oil intermediategoods increased by 6.3 per cent, reflecting the expansionof the industrial sector. The growth in textiles, chemicalproducts, diamond, jewellery, paper and rubber basedindustries has also contributed to high imports ofintermediate goods in 2006.

Amongst the non oil imports, investment goodsexhibited the fastest growth in 2006. Investment goodsimports, which has been continuously expanding in recentyears, grew by 20.1 per cent in 2006, outperforming thegrowth of 12.0 per cent recorded in 2005. The broad-basedgrowth of investment goods across major sub-sectors, i.e.,machinery and equipment, building material and transportequipment was underpinned by accelerated developmentprojects launched by the government and investmentprojects undertaken by the private sector, especially in thefields of construction, telecommunication and informationtechnology. Incentives offered by the government foracquiring advanced technology encouraged industries tomodernise their production facilities in 2006.

In tandem with higher import prices and increaseddemand, consumer goods imports increased by 20.5per cent in 2006. The expenditure on food and beverages

increased, reflecting higher international prices of sugar, milkproducts and wheat. Wheat and sugar were the majorcontributors within this sub-sector accounting for almost 50per cent. In the consumer durables sub-sector, the importsof motor vehicles for personal use, which showed a declinein 2005, increased significantly in 2006.

The trade deficit widened further in 2006 reflecting fasterpace of imports over exports. The trade deficit widenedto US dollars 3,370 million (12.5 per cent of GDP) comparedto US dollars 2,516 million in 2005 (10.7 per cent of GDP).

Higher growth in import prices over the export pricesresulted in a deterioration of the terms of trade in 2006.Fuelled by the surge in world oil prices, exports of rubberand petroleum products, including bunker and aviation fuel,increased with a marked rise in prices during 2006. Asubstantial shortfall in Kenyan tea production and continuousimprovements in the quality of Ceylon tea led tea prices torise above the global average price. Thus, despite themarginal increase in prices of garments and textile exportsin the face of intense competition following the terminationof the MFA in 2005, the rise in the average prices of tea,rubber and petroleum products helped increase the overallexport prices by 4.2 per cent during 2006. The volume ofexports grew by 4.1 per cent in 2006. The high oil pricesthat prevailed during the year increased the prices offertilizer, chemical compounds and sugar. The internationalsugar prices soared as a significant share of the sugar canecrop was diverted for the production of the bio-fuel, ethanolwhich became a popular substitute for gasoline. Short wheatcrops around the world combined with strong demand forwheat and shrunk stocks caused prices to soar to the highestlevels in a decade. These developments led import pricesto grow by 8.0 per cent, whilst the volume of importsincreased by 7.1 percent. Although, the terms of tradedeteriorated by 3.5 per cent during 2006, it was lower thanthe 4.2 per cent deterioration recorded in 2005.

Direction of Trade

Western countries continued to be the major exportdestinations, while Asian countries were the majorimport suppliers. The USA remained Sri Lanka’s largestexport destination, although its share had declinedmarginally from 31 per cent in 2005 to 29 per cent in 2006.Exports to the USA increased only marginally by 0.9 percent reflecting a slow growth of apparel exports on accountof intense regional competition. The UK remained the secondlargest destination for Sri Lanka’s exports with a share of12.8 per cent. Exports to the UK rose significantly,capitalising on tariff concession received by Sri Lanka underthe GSP+ scheme. India remained the third largest exportdestination. However, the share of exports to the Indianmarket declined to 7 per cent in 2006 from 9 per cent in2005, mainly due to lower exports of vanaspathi.

Japan were the other major destinations for Sri Lanka’sexports.

Asia as a region, continued to be the major origin ofimports with a larger contribution from India in 2006.The market share of Asian countries remained unchangedat 60 per cent in 2006. India with a share of 21 per centwas the largest source of imports, followed by Singapore(10 per cent), China (8 per cent), Iran (7 per cent) and HongKong (6 per cent).

5.4 Trade in Services, Income, Transfers andCurrent Account Balance

Trade in Transportation Services

Net earnings from transportation services, whichconsist of freight charges, port related activities andpassenger fares, increased by 3.6 per cent to US dollars211 million in 2006. Inflows from transportation servicesincreased by 11.5 per cent mainly led by a substantialincrease in port related activities, resulting from a highervolume of transshipment cargo handling, and increasedearnings from passenger fares due to the expansion of flyingdestinations by the national carrier as well as the increasein flight frequency. Transshipment cargo handling grew by37 per cent reflecting India’s expanding international tradein tandem with higher economic growth. Several portdevelopment projects identified in the Government’s TenYear Horizon Development Framework 2006-2016,especially the construction of the Colombo South Harbour,

would increase future earning prospects andcompetitiveness of the Colombo Port. Meanwhile, outflowson account of transportation also increased at a higher rateof 14.9 per cent, in line with a higher growth in imports andan increase in Sri Lankans travelling abroad for leisure,employment, education and healthcare purposes.

Travel and Tourism

Tourist arrivals increased by 1.9 per cent to 559,603 in2006 over the 549,308 arrivals in 2005. Reversing the set-back experienced in 2005 due to the tsunami devastation,the number of tourist arrivals recovered gradually duringthe first half of 2006 recording a growth of 17 per cent.However, during the latter part of the year, the situationchanged gradually in the wake of the travel advisories issued

by some Western countries including Italy, Germany, Franceand Australia, which discouraged travel to Sri Lanka.In response the government had several meetings with therelavant ambassadors and engaged in marketing campaignsin those countries to promote Sri Lanka as a safe destination.In spite of negative travel advisories gross earnings fromtourism increased at a high rate of 24.7 per cent to US dollars410.3 million in 2006, mainly due to higher room chargesand increased occupancy rates compared with those in 2005.Western Europe, accounting for a market share of 40.8 percent continued to be the largest tourist-generating region,while South Asia remains the second largest destination witha market share of 30.2 per cent. However, as a single country,India continued to be the largest tourist generating marketto Sri Lanka for the second consecutive year.

Trade in Telecommunication and Information TechnologyServices

Earnings from telecommunication services increased byaround 55 percent to US dollars 68 million in 2006.However, the increased competition among thetelecommunication companies since the liberalisation of theinternational telecommunication gateway in 2003, has drivendown the international call charges encouraging Sri Lankansto originate international calls from Sri Lanka. As a result,outflows on account of telecommunication services continuedto grow since 2003. Consequently, the net earnings fromtelecommunications decreased by 24.5 per cent to US dollars19 million in 2006.

Exports of Software and Information Technology (IT)enabled services such as IT related Business ProcessOutsourcing (BPOs), continued to grow in 2006,supported by further improvements in IT relatedinfrastructure facilities. Net earnings from software and ITenabled services exports increased by around 19 per centto US dollars 98 million in 2006. Sri Lanka possesses acomparative advantage in promoting the export of suchservices due to higher literacy rates. Sri Lanka has the

capacity to produce highly qualified accountants, engineers,lawyers, IT experts and other professionals and has arelatively better IT infrastructure. In addition, Sri Lanka hasa sound legal framework for IT development ande-commerce that protects copyrights and intellectualproperty rights. These positive factors could be favourablyused for the promotion of IT related investments in Sri Lanka.

Inflows and Outflows of Income

A significant increase in income from investment ofofficial external reserves of the country helped tocontain the widening deficit in the income account in2006. The interest income from investment of officialreserves increased by 6 per cent to US dollars 73 million in2006, mainly due to the rising global interest rates and afurther accumulation of official reserves. In addition, thedepreciation of the US dollar against other major currenciesin 2006, as against the appreciation in 2005, resulted in asignificant gain in the values of the external reserves valuedon the basis of marked to market in US dollar terms.Meanwhile, interest payments on external debt increasedsubstantially during the year due to a higher debtaccumulation in the past and expiration of the debtmoratorium in 2005. Repatriation of profits and dividendsby foreign investors, which includes reinvestment of retainedearnings by those investors for the expansion of existingoperations, also increased substantially.

Current Transfers

Inflows to the current transfers account increased by18.6 per cent in 2006 led mainly by increased workerremittances, which grew at a higher rate for the secondconsecutive year, following the tsunami devastation in2004. Worker remittances increased significantly by 21.2per cent to US dollars 2,326 million, despite the numberof migrants leaving for foreign employment decliningby 14.4 per cent to 201,143 in 2006. This increase wasattributable mainly to the increase in the average wages of

The enhanced worker remittances financed about 69 percent of the trade deficit in 2006.

Current Account Balance

The current account deficit widened substantially to USdollars 1,334 million in 2006 from US dollars 651 millionin 2005. In terms of GDP, it increased to 4.9 per cent ofGDP in 2006 from 2.8 per cent of GDP in 2005. Thewidening current account deficit reflects the wideningsavings-investment gap of the country, highlighting the needfor attracting foreign capital to meet the necessary

migrants in the oil producing Middle Eastern region,increased migration to high wage countries such as Korea,Malaysia and Singapore, etc., and the popularisation of theelectronic fund transfer system by Sri Lankan banks amongSri Lankan migrants. New initiatives taken by the CentralBank with the active collaboration of state banks, Sri LankaBureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) and the Associationof Licensed Foreign Employment Agencies (ALFEA) arelikely to enhance worker remittances further in the future.

Worker remittances have become a major source offoreign inflows to the country. Remittances began to growat a higher rate during 2005 and 2006 due to high oilincome in oil producing countries coupled with the impactfrom the aftermath of the Tsunami devastation. Theseincreased inflows helped to finance around 70 per cent oftrade deficits in 2005 and 2006 and to contain currentaccount deficits. In view of the economic importance ofworker remittances (see Box 10 in CBSL, Annual Report2005) the Central Bank took several new initiatives during2006 to enhance remittances further.

Measures to Enhance Worker Remittances

Several measures were initiated in 2006 jointly by theCentral Bank, commercial banks, Association of LicensedForeign Employment Agencies (ALFEA) and Sri LankaBureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) to identifyproblems faced by the migrant workers in remitting moneyand problems faced by banks in mobilising remittances. Amajor problem faced by migrant workers was the lack ofawareness on benefits provided by commercial banks.Thus, with the Central Bank advice, SLBFE and foreignemployment agencies began to educate both Sri Lankanmigrants in labour hiring countries, their beneficiaries inSri Lanka as well as would be migrants on facilities offeredby commercial banks and benefits available to them.Meanwhile, recognising the economic importance ofworker remittances, the government appointed a High-Level Committee to study issues and recommendappropriate policies and mechanisms to encourage migrantworkers to use formal channels for remittances.

The need for various other measures was also feltstrongly. These include language training, training onhandling of electronic household items, diversifyingemployment markets, arrangements for long-term

employment contracts and direct government involvementin securing foreign employment for Sri Lankans. Effortsshould also be directed towards encouraging labour hiringcountries in East Asia and the Middle East to increaseaverage wages of the migrants. In addition, creatingawareness on availability of duty free allowances topurchase goods from duty free shops in Sri Lanka,extension of the duration of duty free allowance were alsofelt necessary to enhance remittances by migrant workers.Linking incentives such as duty free allowances, housingloans and loan facilities to commence self-employmentprojects on return to the country, etc. to the amountremitted would further encourage remittances through thebanking channels. Provision of pre-departure loanfacilities to potential migrants with agreements to remitmoney through the particular banks would also encourageremittances through banking channels. Meanwhile, theforeign employment agencies should be incentivised byway of recognition of their contribution.

Difficulties faced by commercial banks such as visasfor operating in host countries need to be resolved. Thisis vital since the efforts of commercial banks inchannelling remittances through official means not onlyenhances remittances flows to the country, but also preventthose funds being utilised for illegal activities includingterrorist financing. To further enhance this process,domestic banks could also use the widespread postalnetwork and mobile telephone technology to deliver theremittances fast, while sharing their paymentinfrastructures for better delivery of services to thebeneficiaries. Since the remittances are directly linkedto income of migrant workers, there should be a gradualincrease in the skill levels of migrants leaving Sri Lanka.

5.5 Capital and Financial Flows, and Balanceof Payments

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)

In 2006, the country received the highest-ever FDIinflows, surpassing the previous highest level recordedin 1997. The total FDI inflows reached the highest-everlevel of US dollars 604 million in 2006, surpassing theprevious record level of US dollars 450 million in 1997, whichincluded privatisation proceeds of around US dollars 301million. The increased investment flows could be attributableto the substantial increase in reinvestment of retainedearnings by the existing BOI companies, especially thosein the services sector, and new initiatives by the BOI toattract higher investments including the setting up of 300factories in less developed regions under its Nipayum Centreprogramme. The FDI inflows consist of equity capital of USdollars 81 million, loans and advances of US dollars 75million by the shareholders, foreign loans of US dollars 124million and the reinvestment of retained earnings of USdollars 324 million by the existing companies. Theacceleration of the basic infrastructure development in theform of roads, highways and power supply, etc., whilemaintaining an enabling business environment that ensureproperty rights, sound and fast dispute settlement and agreater labour mobility, would help achieve even higherlevels of FDI. Meanwhile, FDI outflows decreased to USdollars 30 million in 2006 from US dollars 38 million in 2005as only a few selected local companies invested abroadduring the year.

Foreign Capital to the Government

The government was able to mobilise a record USdollars 1.2 billion worth of grants and loans during 2006.Of the total loan receipts in 2006, 75 per cent was receivedon concessional terms and the balance 25 per cent oncommercial terms and conditions. The total grants,

consisting of both the current and capital nature, increasedto US dollars 287 million in 2006 from US dollars 236 millionin 2005, due to more funds being received for tsunamireconstruction activities. Meanwhile, the total long-term loaninflows increased to US dollars 932 million in 2006. During2006, the government mobilised US dollars 150 millionsyndicated loans from the international markets.Concessional loan inflows also increased by around 11 percent to US dollars 703 million. The programme loan inflowsincreased to US dollars 52 million in 2006 and consisted ofloans for the fiscal management reform programme, the ruralfinancial sector development programme and theSapugaskande power plant programme. However, thegovernment was not able to utilise fully the availableprogramme financing, as the proposed improvements in theCeylon Electricity Board (CEB) were not implemented duringthe year. The disbursement of project loans increased byaround 6.5 per cent to US dollars 651 million in 2006 due tothe reconstruction of infrastructure damaged by the tsunamiand the implementation of several other infrastructureprojects. The foreign aid utilization rate increased in 2006to 21.2 per cent from the 17.0 per cent recorded in 20051.Meanwhile, loan repayments by the government increasedsignificantly by 127.4 per cent to US dollars 441 million,with the recommencement of debt repayment in 2006 with

the end of the debt moratorium in 2005 and the increase indefence loan repayments.

External and domestic commercial foreign currencyborrowings increased significantly in 2006. Although,these foreign currency commercial loans have beenrelatively cheaper compared to rupee borrowings, the sharprise in commercial debt stock would increase the debt stock’sexposure to exchange rate risks. Since all these foreigncurrency loans were on commercial rates with relativelyshorter maturities compared with concessional externalloans, it is prudent that these funds are invested in highlyproductive projects so that servicing these commercial debtswould not threaten government’s fiscal and debtsustainability. In this context, the government should activelyconsider promoting Public- Private Partnerships (PPPs) asa viable alternative financing mechanism for developingmuch needed major infrastructure facilities. Severaldeveloped and developing countries have increasinglyformed PPPs in infrastructure development, as amechanism for financing of long-term infrastructuredevelopment, diversifying risks associated with long-termprojects and to harness the efficiency and managerialcapability of the private sector. It is also important to bemindful of the hidden cost of some export credit facilitiesoffered by the bilateral lenders, as the actual costs of suchloan facilities are much higher than the apparent low ratesof interest offered by them. This is because, very often,under such facilities, a major portion of loan proceeds areto be utilised to procure goods and services from specifiedorganisation or lending countries, which prevents theborrowing country from reaping benefits through acompetitive international bidding process. In some cases,these facilities also carry hidden charges in the form of

unnecessary technical assistance programmes, insurancepremia, management fees and other charges.

Loan Capital to the Private Sector

Long-term loan inflows to the private sector and publiccorporations decreased in 2006. Availability of credit atrelatively low interest rates in the domestic market andhigher international market rates may have discouragedforeign borrowings by the private sector during the first halfof 2006. Restraints by the government in guaranteeingforeign loans to public corporations and private sectorinstitutions may also have contributed to this low level ofdisbursements. Further, it is reported that some investorsmay not be making medium and long-term investments dueto concerns arising out of prevailing security situation andhave adopted a ‘wait and see’ attitude, which may have, tosome extent, reduced the demand for foreign financing in2006. At the same time, there are many investors who haverealised that, currently, most assets in the country areavailable at a discounted price due to the prevailing securitysituation, and that such assets are likely to command higherprices in the future with the expected rapid improvement ininfrastructure facilities and upgrading of existing assets. Inthat background, several investors believe that they couldmake use of the current situation to expand their investmentnow to generate substantial gains in the future.

Short-Term Capital

Total net short-term private capital inflows reached USdollars 610 million in 2006, compared to US dollars 176million recorded in 2005 due to a substantial increasein investment in Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs)and in domestic foreign currency lending bycommercial banks. Both inflows and outflows on account

one of the best performing share markets in Asia attractinga gross inflow of US dollars 355 million in 2006, comparedto US dollars 276 million in 2005. Net foreign assets ofcommercial banks decreased significantly in 2006 due tothe combined effect of increased foreign currency lendingto the government and higher foreign currency liabilities dueto new foreign loans raised by commercial banks.

Balance of Payments and External Reserves

As net inflows to the capital and financial account weremore than sufficient to offset the widened currentaccount deficit, the BOP recorded a surplus of USdollars 204 million in 2006.

External Reserves

The BOP surplus strengthened the gross officialreserves for the second consecutive year. The grossofficial reserves, excluding ACU receipts, increased, in spite

of a higher debt repayment to the IMF. However, in terms ofimport coverage, reserves declined to 3 months of importsin 2006 from 3.3 months of imports in 2005, mainly due tothe higher oil imports expenditure in 2006. Meanwhile, thereserve adequacy, as measured by the ratio of gross officialreserves to short term debt and liabilities, improved to 92per cent in 2006 from 84 per cent in 2005. Notwithstandingsuch improvement, the total external reserves of the country,excluding ACU receipts, decreased, mainly due to theutilisation of commercial banks’ foreign assets to meet theexcess demand for import financing.

5.6 External Debt and Debt Service

External Debt

The total external debt of the country, as a percentageof GDP, continued to decline in 2006, reflecting furtherimprovements in the country’s debt sustainability,primarily due to a higher output growth. Accordingly, asa percentage of GDP, the total external debt decreased to45.4 per cent in 2006 from 48.2 per cent in 2005. In USdollar terms, the total external debt increased by around7.8 per cent to US dollars 12,235 million in 2006, owing toincreased loan disbursements to the government andweakening of the US dollar against major currencies. Of thetotal outstanding external debt, around 42 per cent of theloans were denominated in SDR and around 30 per cent in

Japanese yen. Meanwhile, the total external debt andliabilities, which consist of ACU liabilities and commercialbanks’ liabilities, also decreased to 52.8 per cent of GDP.The banking sector’s external liabilities increasedsignificantly by around 20 per cent to US dollars 1,994 millionby end 2006 as some commercial banks raised foreign loans.

Of the total medium and long-term debt, the governmentdebt accounts for as much as 90 per cent, with theremaining 10 per cent representing borrowings of both,the private and public corporations and debt obligations

to the IMF. This reflects the government’s continuousdominance in attracting foreign loan capital into the countryand the limitations of the private sector in raising externaldebt. The financially sound private sector enterprises needto be encouraged to raise medium and long-term externalcapital for their investments. This would release domesticfinancial resources to private sector enterprises that are notcapable of raising external debt. Of the government’sexternal debt stock, concessional debt accounts for 96 percent.

External Debt Service Payments

Debt service ratios reverted to pre-tsunami levelsfollowing the one-off reduction in debt servicing in 2005due to the benefits of the debt moratorium. The totaldebt service payments, which consist of both amortisationand interest payments on all foreign debt, increasedsignificantly by around 73.2 per cent to US dollars 1,079million in 2006. The expiration of the debt moratorium offeredby members of the Paris Club, G-8 countries and multilaterallending institutions in 2005 and the resumption of scheduleddebt repayments in 2006, the increase in defence loanrepayments, increased debt servicing costs of government’scommercial borrowings, and the depreciation of the US dollaragainst the SDR had contributed to the increase in SriLanka’s external debt service payments in US dollar terms,during 2006. However, debt service ratios, which measurethe country’s capacity to service its external debt still remainsat comfortable levels despite a relatively high external debtstock, mainly due to the large stock of concessional debtwith long repayment periods.

5.7 Exchange Rate Regime and Exchange RateMovements

Sri Lanka continued to follow an independently floatingexchange rate regime during 2006, allowing marketforces to determine the exchange rate with limitedintervention by the Central Bank to mitigate excessive

volatility in the market. This regime has served well forSri Lanka since its adoption in 2001. The rupee, whichappreciated during 2005 against major internationalcurrencies in the wake of the massive aid pledges by theinternational donors and the higher tsunami related foreigninflows, reverted to its usual depreciating trend during 2006.The rupee depreciated at a moderate rate against the USdollar (5.2 per cent), Japanese yen (4.3 per cent) and Indianrupee, (7.2 per cent), while it depreciated at a higher rateagainst the sterling pound (16.7 per cent) and euro (14.6per cent), mainly due to the weakening of the US dollaragainst these currencies during 2006.

A larger current account deficit, caused by substantiallyhigher imports and the relatively higher domesticinflation that prevailed in Sri Lanka compared to thoseof its trading partners and competitor countries, exertedpressure on the exchange rate to depreciate. However,increased worker remittances, unprecedented FDI inflowsand higher foreign inflows to the government, includingcommercial borrowings, resulted in an overall balance ofpayments surplus in 2006 and improved market confidence,thus negating the tendency for excessive depreciation ofthe rupee towards the end of 2006.

Nominal and Real Effective Exchange Rates

During 2006, the Nominal Effective Exchange Ratedepreciated, reversing the appreciating trend seen in2005, while the Real Effective Exchange Rate continuedwith the same trend. Reflecting the higher nominaldepreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee against the majorcurrencies, the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) ofthe Sri Lanka rupee, based on both, the 5 currency and the24 currency baskets, depreciated during 2006. Meanwhile,the real effective exchange rate (REER), which takes intoaccount the inflation differentials amongst countries inaddition to the variations in exchange rates, appreciatedduring 2006, indicating a deterioration in the competitivenessof Sri Lanka’s exports. This could be attributed to the

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report 2006

92

relatively higher domestic inflation compared to those of thetrading partner and competitor countries.

Developments in the Domestic Foreign ExchangeMarket

The level of activity in the inter-bank foreign exchangemarket increased substantially during 2006 reflectinghigher international trade and remittances flows. Severalmeasures introduced by the Central Bank in consultationwith the players in the foreign exchange market alsocontributed for further expansion in the foreign exchangemarket. During the year, the Central Bank permittedcommercial banks to offer rupee based cross currencyoptions to domestic corporate clients to expand the activitiesin the foreign exchange market. The customer market, whichconsists of foreign exchange sales and purchases to andfrom customers by commercial banks, also recorded anincrease in the level of activity. The total volume oftransactions in the customer market recorded the highestlevel since the floating of the rupee and reflected an 11 percent increase over 2005. However, forward transactions inthe customer market still remain negligible, which indicatesthe need for more public awareness on the use of availableinstruments to hedge the exchange rate risk.

The Central Bank took the initiative to facilitate the CPCentering into hedging arrangements for oil imports tomitigate the impact of rising oil prices on the BOP andto reduce volatility in the foreign exchange market. Asthe oil prices reached a record high level in 2006,expenditure on oil imports increased by US dollars 415million to US dollars 2,070 million. This created excessivevolatility in the market, whilst increasing the trade deficit.Had the CPC entered into a hedging mechanisms prior to2006 the country could have saved substantial foreignexchange reducing the trade deficit and excessive volatilityin the foreign exchange market.
