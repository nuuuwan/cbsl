Though touristarrivals suffered a setback during the latter part of the year,the overall performance in terms of earnings during the yearshowed an improvement over the previous year. Workerremittances increased substantially for the secondconsecutive year. In the meantime, imports grew at anincreased rate due to higher international oil prices, andimports of investment goods. The exceptionally high oilprices experienced during the year led to a deterioration inthe terms of trade by 3.5 per cent. Reflecting thesedevelopments, the external official reserves improved,thereby strengthening the resilience of the external sectorto external shocks. The rupee depreciated by around 5.2per cent which was commensurate with the inflationdifference between Sri Lanka and its major trading partners,reducing the pressure in the foreign exchange market. Toattain the objectives of mitigating the impact of rising oilprices on the BOP, reducing volatility in the domestic foreignexchange market and protecting consumers from rising oilprices, the Central Bank took initiatives to encourage theCeylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) to enter into hedgingarrangements in relation to their oil purchases.",

Although apparel exports to the USAdeclined marginally, exports to the EU including apparelincreased significantly by 18.4 per cent partly capitalisingthe concessions offered by the GSP+ scheme. The growthin the EU was reflected in the expansion of market share inthe UK, Italy, Germany, France and the Netherlands.Although the exports of rubber based products increasedin 2006, the sector was affected by high and aggressivefluctuations in the prices of raw materials. Food andbeverage exports, which increased remarkably in 2005,were affected by the reduction in exports of vanaspathi toIndia in 2006. Agricultural exports were largely led by higherperformance of tea and rubber in 2006. With a record-settingperformance, tea exports benefited from supply shortagesin the international markets due to the drought in Kenyaand a greater demand from the CIS and the Middle Eastcountries. However, the value added tea exports declinedin 2006, mainly due to lower exports to Jordan, Iraq and",

The internationalsugar prices soared as a significant share of the sugar canecrop was diverted for the production of the bio-fuel, ethanolwhich became a popular substitute for gasoline.

Since all these foreigncurrency loans were on commercial rates with relativelyshorter maturities compared with concessional externalloans, it is prudent that these funds are invested in highlyproductive projects so that servicing these commercial debtswould not threaten government\u2019s fiscal and debtsustainability. In this context, the government should activelyconsider promoting Public- Private Partnerships (PPPs) asa viable alternative financing mechanism for developingmuch needed major infrastructure facilities. Severaldeveloped and developing countries have increasinglyformed PPPs in infrastructure development, as amechanism for financing of long-term infrastructuredevelopment, diversifying risks associated with long-termprojects and to harness the efficiency and managerialcapability of the private sector. It is also important to bemindful of the hidden cost of some export credit facilitiesoffered by the bilateral lenders, as the actual costs of suchloan facilities are much higher than the apparent low ratesof interest offered by them. This is because, very often,under such facilities, a major portion of loan proceeds areto be utilised to procure goods and services from specifiedorganisation or lending countries, which prevents theborrowing country from reaping benefits through acompetitive international bidding process.
