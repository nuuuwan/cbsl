The country\u2019s per capita incomerose to US dollars 1,355. Exports continued to grow withthe enhanced global competitiveness, and imports grew tosupport the growing expansion of the production capacityof the economy. The highest ever growth in workerremittances and highest ever inflows of foreign directinvestment and external financing to the government helpedto finance growing trade and current account deficits,resulting in a surplus of US dollars 204 million in thecountry\u2019s balance of payments in 2006. The fiscalconsolidation process continued with further improvementin government revenue and a decline in government debtas a percentage of GDP while accommodating high publicinvestment on multiple infrastructure development projects.The decelerating trend in inflation experienced during theearly part of the year reversed from April, mainly due tohigh monetary expansion. The upward revision inadministered prices caused a one-off increase in pricelevels, but it was conducive for controlling inflation in thelong term by closing avenues for further monetaryexpansion. Meanwhile, the supply disturbances that arosefrom adverse weather conditions during the latter part ofthe year resulted in negative supply shocks exertingpressure on prices. The continuation of the tight monetarypolicy measures, supplemented by some prudentialmeasures, contained the demand driven inflation to someextent. In January 2007, the Central Bank introduced furthermeasures, aimed at lowering inflation to a single digit levelby end 2007. The further expansion in the financial markets",

In thatcontext, the assurance by the government of non-privatisation of SOEs should not be considered as a coverby those SOEs to continue enjoying monopolistic or largemarket shares in providing those services withoutconcentrating on improvements of their services for thegeneral public while ensuring efficient and cost effectiveinfrastructure services. The non-privatisation policy imposesa serious corporate commitment on these enterprises tooperate more efficiently, and thereby generating areasonable rate of return to the government, while providinggood quality services to the public without being a burdenon the taxpayers. The provision of such level of services onan internationally competitive basis is a prerequisite toachieving high growth rates for a small open economy likeSri Lanka, which critically depends on its ability to competein international markets in exporting goods and services. Itis heartening to note that the Ten-year Vision has clearlyrecognized the importance of these services and hasallocated a large quantum of public investment to expandthe infrastructure managed by SOEs. The government beingthe owner of these SOEs has to depend on appointed agentsand/or boards to manage these SOEs. Thus, there has tobe mechanisms to ensure that those agents perform theirtasks to generate benefits to the country rather thanconcentrating on the organizational and personal benefitsonly. It is therefore essential for the government to obtainthese SOEs\u2019 serious commitments to generate a sufficientreturn on the investment and ensure a reasonable level offuture cash flows from such massive investments.

Thegrowth arose mainly from textiles, wearing apparel andleather products, rubber based products, food, beveragesand non-metallic mineral products and the higher growth ofthe construction sector driven by the greater performanceof infrastructure development projects in the areas of roadsand highways, telecommunication, housing and propertydevelopment, hotels and restaurants, power generation andthe continuation of tsunami reconstruction activities. Thegrowth of the construction sector was evident from the highergrowth of non-metallic mineral products including cement,ceramics and building materials. The diamond processing,gem and jewellery industry also performed well in the exportmarket in 2006. The restructuring of the industrial sectortook place through improvements in labour productivitythrough cost economising, product specialisation,acquisitions and mergers, process improvements,technology developments, strategic alliances, developingbackward linkages and improved marketing capabilities in2006.",

Inaddition to these measures, the margin requirement againstletters of credit for some selected imported items wasimposed while banks were instructed not to grant credit tomeet such margin requirements. As a further step ofrestraining high credit expansion, moral suasion was activelyapplied to discourage commercial bank borrowings from theCentral Bank through the reverse repurchase facility. Theseefforts were complemented by the prudential requirementsimposed on banks such as a general provisioningrequirement on all performing loans and an increase in riskweights in respect of loans for capital adequacy purposes.The elimination of the petroleum subsidy was also anotherstep that was taken in that direction since the continuationof the subsidy would have exerted further pressure onbudgetary financing resulting in higher monetary expansion.",

The government\u2019s policy decisionimplemented in 2006 and 2007 to establish a new statebank, Sri Lanka Savings Bank Ltd., to vest the businessof the failed Pramuka Bank was a major step takentowards re-building public confidence in small banks.In addition, the Central Bank took several measures toboost public confidence in banks and mitigate potentialrisks to the wider financial system. Among them, therestructuring of two small banks in 2003 with the supportof two established banks and the announcement ofenhanced minimum entry capital requirement of banksin April 2005 were significant moves and these measureshelped to promote consolidation among banks.Similarly, issues relating to dominant ownership in afew private banks also raised new fears among the savingpublic and financial community. The Central Bank wasable to successfully deal with such fears by introducingnew policy guidelines for regulation of bank ownershipin January 2007. Accordingly, the broad-basing ofownership in banks by requiring large ownerships heldby single shareholders or groups to be reduced to 15 percent within a maximum period of five years was a majorpolicy measure towards avoiding conflicts of interest inBoards of Directors. An unprecedented growth inconsumption credit has also been witnessed since thelatter part of 2006 and the need for monetary policy torespond through appropriate prudential regulation wasconsidered necessary in order to arrest the highconcentration of consumer credit. The high rate of creditexpansion which could result in a deteriorating qualityof credit was also a regulatory concern.To address this concern, a general provision of 1 percent of all performing loans was required to bemaintained in addition to existing provisioning rules.However, in view of the adverse impact of this measureon the profitability of banks, the implementation of thisgeneral provision was staggered over a period of tenquarters requiring banks to make a provision of 0.1 percent each quarter begining fourth quarter of 2006.The prudential requirements on maximum amountof accomodation were also revised in February 2007 andthis was envisaged to widen distribution of credit,mitigate credit concentration risk and promote riskmanagement by banks and customers by taking intoconsideration capital adequacy ratios of banks and creditratings of customers and banks.",

In thisregard, the Central Bank has continuously promotedpublic awareness progammes through the media and theissue of various publications to educate the public ofrisks involved in transactions with banks and otherfinancial institutions. Three annual Financial StabilityReports were published releasing information andanalysis on risks in the financial system as a whole.Banks have been required to publish their financialstatements in the press on a quarterly basis to disclosetheir key performance indicators. In addition, the banksare required to obtain credit ratings from approvedRating Agencies and publish such ratings in alladvertisements aimed at soliciting deposits. All suchmeasures are intended to make the depositors andinvestors understand that it is imperative that they tooassess the risks and returns on their money deposited orinvested in a particular bank or a financial institution.

It would also serve to increase theoutstanding government debt further and place therepayment capacity under serious stress, thereby inhibitingthe simultaneous development of infrastructure facilities.Therefore, Public-Private Partnerships need to be activelyand quickly promoted to support infrastructure investmentto maintain long-term fiscal sustainability. The projectsimplemented under PPPs could also be a future source ofgovernment revenue via dividends, tax revenues and capitalgains.
