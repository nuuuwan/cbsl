John Exter: Central Banker for All Times1

The first death anniversary of John Exter, Founder Governor of the Central Bank, was commemorated on 28th

of February 2007. He died in 2006 after living a very productive life for 95 long years.

John Exter lent his wisdom, intellect and experience, without any reservation, for the establishment of the

Central Bank of Ceylon in 1950 through the recommendations made by him in a report, now known as the Exter Report.He became the first Governor of the Central Bank at the young age of 39. His task was to establish the Bank, staff it and

lead it in the first few formative years, so that it could eventually be taken over by a Sri Lankan management. The

rationale and philosophy of the Central Bank, which he evinced in his report in the late1940s, are equally valid even fortoday, as it carries a justification of each and every section of the Monetary Law, so that the later generations of central

bankers would not have any ambiguity of what was meant by them. Hence, by any standard, Exter is a central banker forall times.

The story relating to the appointment of Exter for preparing a blueprint for the establishment of a more flexiblecentral bank by replacing the Currency Board System, which the country had inherited from the British, has been

narrated by Edmund Eramudugolla, a former Senior Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, in his book “Reminiscencesof the Central Bank of Sri Lanka”. According to him, the government decided to seek foreign assistance to prepare a

blueprint for a central bank based on the country’s specific position and future prospects and sought assistance fromUSA. Thus, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was approached to get a qualified consultant for this purpose. The

Bank in turn made available the services of John Exter who was at that time an advisor to the Ministry of Finance of the

Philippines.

John Exter had an illustrious academic as well as professional career. After graduating from the College ofWooster, he completed postgraduate work at both the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and Harvard University.

Before accepting the Government of Ceylon assignment, Exter had worked with highest repute at MIT, Federal Reserve

System and as an advisor to the Secretary of Finance of the Philippines. It is from there that he came as the consultant onthe establishment of a central bank. He served 3 years as the Governor of the Central Bank. In 1953, Exter joined the

World Bank for a year and then returned to the Federal Reserve System as its Vice President on international operationsat the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In 1959, Exter was approached to join the First National City Bank, which

later became the Citibank. From 1960 to 1972, he was the Senior Vice President of the Citibank in charge of its relationswith foreign central banks and governments. With a huge fortune made on gold assets at the time of collapse of the gold

exchange standard in 1971, Exter took an early retirement in 1972 and went into private consultancy work.

Exter belonged to the old guard of economists who believed that economic prosperity cannot be attained by

printing money. This was indeed going against the popular tides of Keynesianism of the late 1930s and 1940s. Exterdoubted the validity of deficit financing as a strategy for attaining full employment both in his public speeches and

writings. On the very first day of the establishment of the Central Bank of Ceylon, he warned against the use of Central

Bank for things which it cannot fulfill. He pointed out that the Central Bank does not by itself produce goods andservices, but it should, by creating the right monetary conditions help to bring about better living standards. Exter

maintained that the Central Bank was a necessary condition for future prosperity. The prosperity was to be created by

maintaining price stability so that the economic agents could make economic decisions based on long run prospects.The Central Bank’s only weapon is to print money and such money, by changing the price levels, acts only as an

illusion. In the Exter Report, he argued that higher income created through money creation would simply stimulateconsumption of imported goods and precipitate serious balance of payments difficulties. To safeguard any attempt to

use the Central Bank as a tool of deficit financing, a provision was included in the Monetary Law prohibiting the

Central Bank to engage in trade or otherwise have a direct commercial interest in asset building. Exter pointed out thatsuch interests would lead to money creation, generate conflicts of interest and prevent making investment decisions

based on hard-core economic principles. Central Bank’s pursuing profits as a goal was also frowned upon by Exter.From a technical point of view, Central Bank’s profit seeking has no meaning, because a central bank could make any

amount of profits by inflating the economy. Hence, the Exter Report suggested a mechanism to avoid any inflationaryor deflationary effects of transferring Central Bank’s profits to the Government. Such transfers lead to commercial

banks’ building their reserves, thereby raising multiple credit creating capability in banks. Therefore, Exter has made

special provisions in the Monetary Law regarding the appropriation of profits of the Central Bank. Accordingly, theCentral Bank profits are first used for building its reserves to support the domestic currency, and then, used to retire the

government’s borrowings from the Central Bank or paid into the government as a normal profit transfer.

The issue relating to the Central Bank’s independence was a key issue that was considered by Exter when designing the

Bank’s supreme decision making body, namely, the Monetary Board (MB) with the Secretary to the Ministry of Financeas a member. The question was whether the presence of the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance in the MB would lead

to the fiscal policy overriding monetary policy. Though critiques have put forward this argument, Exter’s response wasto create an environment where both the government and the Central Bank was to have a peaceful and amicable

cohabitation. The degree of independence was extended via the budget of the Central Bank, job security of the keyofficials, and power to make monetary policy being possible without consulting the government. The wisdom of Exter

was that the Central Bank should, as far as, possible work in consultation with the government, rather than in isolation.

Exter expected this arrangement to exist on the basis of experience, professionalism and political conventions and notthrough an established piece of legislation. Therefore, the lesson Exter has left for us in the twenty first century is that

both the Central Bank and the government should know their rights and responsibilities well and act on an ethicalplatform in which they continue to appreciate the distinctive roles to be played by each one of them for the well being

of the country.

1.1.Accountability and the Financial Performanceof the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in relation toits Objectives.

The Central Bank was established as the authorityresponsible for the administration, supervision andregulation of the monetary, financial and paymentsystems of Sri Lanka under the Monetary Law Act.In accordance with this Act, the Bank is chargedwith the responsibility of securing the coreobjectives of economic and price stability andfinancial system stability.

The basis of public accountability for the CentralBank and the success of its operations thereforewould be the effectiveness of its policies andoperations leading towards the achievement of itscore objectives and not necessarily its profitabilityper se. These statutory objectives are thefundamental features that distinguish the CentalBank from any entity in the private or public sector.Accordingly, a profitability related approach, ifadopted by the Central Bank, could result in theBank pursuing profits while compromising its coreobjectives, since it has the unique ability to createits own profits through its monetary policy activitieswhich could influence interest rates and exchangerates. It therefore follows that the Central Bank’sobjectives of economic and price stability andfinancial system stability need to be distinguishedand detached from the pure profitability objectivewhich should essentially be incidental or academiconly.

In this background, the Central Bank’s financialstatements record results in the implementation ofits monetary policy operations, exchange ratemanagement, issuing of currency, etc, at the valuesas realized and are presented in accrordance withapplicable accounting and reporting standards toprovide a basis for financial accountability as apartial fulfillment of the overall publicaccountability and hence, the financial performanceas reported in these statements needs to beinterpreted and understood in that context.

1.2.Reporting Entity and Statutory Base

These are the financial statements of the CentralBank of Sri Lanka (“Bank” or “CBSL”), theinstitution established under the Monetary Law ActNo 58 of 1949 of Sri Lanka as amended (“MLA”),as the authority responsible for the administration,supervision and regulation of monetary, financial andpayment system of Sri Lanka. Central Bank of SriLanka is domiciled in the Democratic SocialistRepublic of Sri Lanka and situated at No: 30,Janadhipathi Mawatha, Colombo 01.

1.3.Accounting Policies

1.3.1. Basis of preparation

The financial statements are prepared on thehistorical cost basis, except for land & building andcertain financial assets that have been measured atfair value as identified in specific accountingpolicies below.

Reporting Format

The Bank presents financial assets and financialliabilities, and their associated income and expensestreams, by distinguishing between foreign currencyand local currency activities. In the balance sheet,assets and liabilities are presented broadly in orderof liquidity within such distinguished category. TheBank considers that this reporting approach provideappropriate reporting of the Bank’s activities whichare more fully described in Note 1.5.

Statement of Compliance

1.3.2. Significant Accounting Judgments and Estimates

In the process of applying the accounting policies,the bank has made the following judgments apartfrom those involving estimations, which have themost significant effect on the amounts recognizedin the financial statements.

Impairment of Available for Sale Investments

The Bank determines that Available for SaleInvestments are impaired when there has been asignificant or prolonged decline in the fair valuebelow its cost. This determination of what issignificant or prolonged requires judgment.

Pensions and Other Post Employment BenefitPlans

The cost of defined benefit plans is determined usingan actuarial valuation. The actuarial valuationinvolves making assumptions about discount rates,expected rates of return on assets, futurecompensation increases, mortality rates and futurepension increases. Due to the long term nature ofthese plans, such estimates are subject to significantuncertainty.

1.3.3. Adoption of Amended IFRS during the year

The accounting policies adopted are consistent withthose used in the previous year. The Bank adoptedIAS 39: Financial Instruments- Recognition andMeasurement, amended in connection with FinancialGuarantee Contracts. The new accounting policyadopted is given in 1.4.2.

1.3.4. Standards, interpretations and amendments topublished standards that are not yet effective

Certain new standards, amendments andinterpretations to existing standards have beenpublished that are applicable for the Bank’saccounting periods beginning on or after 1 January2007 or later periods but which the Bank has not earlyadopted, as follows:

IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, andcomplementary amendments to IAS 1, Presentationof Financial Statements – Capital Disclosures(effective from 1 January 2007). IFRS 7 introducesnew disclosures to improve the information aboutfinancial instruments. It requires the disclosure ofqualitative and quantitative information aboutexposure to risks arising from financial instruments,including specified minimum disclosures about creditrisk, liquidity risk and market risk, includingsensitivity analysis to market risk. It replaces IAS30, Disclosures in the Financial Statements of Banks

and Similar Financial Institutions, and disclosurerequirements in IAS 32, Financial Instruments:Disclosure and Presentation. It is applicable to allentities that report under IFRS. The amendments toIAS 1 introduce disclosures about the level of anentity’s capital and how it manages capital. The Bankis in the process of assessing the impact of IFRS 7and the amendment to IAS 1.

IFRS 8, Operating Segments (effective from 1January 2009) – IFRS 8 specifies how an entityshould report information about its operatingsegments in annual financial statements. The Bankis in the process of assessing the impact of IFRS 8and its voluntary application.

1.4.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

1.4.1.Foreign Currency Conversions

Bank’s functional and presentation currency is SriLanka Rupees (Rs). Transactions in foreigncurrencies are initially recorded in the functionalcurrency ruling at the date of transaction. Monetaryassets and liabilities denominated in foreigncurrencies are retranslated at the rate of exchangeruling at the balance sheet date. All differences aretaken to the Income Statement. For the purposes ofretranslation the following Sri Lanka rupee exchangerates for major currencies were used:

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms ofhistorical cost in a foreign currency are translatedusing exchange rates at the dates of initialtransactions.

1.4.2.Financial Assets and Liabilities

The Bank presents financial assets and liabilities, andthe associated income and expense streams, bydistinguishing between foreign currency and localcurrency activities. Foreign currency activitiesmainly arise from the Bank’s foreign reservesmanagement function. Local currency activitiesmainly reflect the assets and liabilities associated withmonetary policy implementation, issuing currencyand banking activities.

The separate reporting of these activities isconsidered to provide a better presentation of theBank’s financial position, financial performance andrisk profile. The Bank considers that the combinedreporting of foreign and local currency activitieswould weaken the informational value of thefinancial statements.

All financial assets are initially recognised at cost,being the fair value of the consideration given andincluding acquisition charges associated with theinvestment. Subsequent measurement bases afterinitial recognition, are described below. All regularway purchases and sales of financial assets arerecognised on the trade date. Regular way purchasesor sales are purchases or sales of financial assets thatrequire delivery of assets within the time framegenerally established by regulation or convention inthe market place.

Securities at Fair Value through Profit or Loss

Financial assets classified as held for trading areincluded in the category securities at fair valuethrough profit or loss. These securities aresubsequently valued at quoted market prices.Changes in market value are recognised as anincrease or decrease in the value of the securities inthe Balance Sheet while resulting gains and lossesare recognised in the Income Statement.

Where the security is still owned, the gain or loss isreported as Gain /(Loss) from Unrealised PriceRevaluations. Where the gain or loss has beenrealised (through selling the security), this is reportedas Gain /(Loss) Realised from Price Changes.

Foreign Currency Available-for-SaleInvestments

Foreign currency available for sale investments aresubsequently valued at quoted market prices.Changes in market value are recognised as anincrease or decrease in the value of the available forsale securities in the Balance Sheet under reserves.

Gains and losses arising from changes in the marketvalue of foreign currency available-for-saleinvestments are recognised on a separate componentof equity (shown under Other Reserves in the BalanceSheet) until the investment is sold, collected orotherwise disposed of, or until the investment isdetermined to be impaired, at which time thecumulative gain or loss previously reported as equityis included in income.

Securities denominated in Gold

Gold securities held with foreign counterparties areinitially stated at cost. Gains and losses arising fromchanges in the market value of Gold Securities arerecognised in the Income Statement. Where the GoldSecurities are still owned, the gain or loss is reportedas Gain /(Loss) from Unrealised Price Revaluations.Where the gain or loss has been realised (throughselling the Gold Securities), this is reported as Gain /(Loss) Realised from Price Changes.

Derivative Instruments

The Bank’s involvement in derivative instrumentsis mainly in forward foreign exchange contracts. Suchderivative financial instruments are stated at fairvalue. The fair value of forward exchange contractsis calculated by reference to current forward exchangerates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. Allderivative instruments in a gain or loss position, ifany, are reported within the balance of foreigncurrency trading or available for sale securities inthe Balance Sheet.

International Monetary Fund (IMF) RelatedBalances

The Bank transacts with the International MonetaryFund (IMF) in its own right rather than as an agentfor the Government of Sri Lanka. All transactionsby the Bank with the IMF have been included in thesefinancial statements on that basis.

Quota with the IMF is recorded by the Bank as anasset and the amount payable to the IMF for quota isrecorded as a liability of the Bank. The cumulativeallocation of SDRs by the IMF is treated as a liability.Exchange gains and losses arising on revaluation ofIMF assets and liabilities at the exchange rateapplying at balance sheet date as published by theIMF are recognised in the Income Statement.

All other charges and interest pertaining to balanceswith the IMF are recorded immediately in the IncomeStatement.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at foreignbanks and financial institutions and short-termdeposits.

As a part of local currency activities CBSL generatescertain income and incurs expenses, which do notinvolve in movement of cash. Those activities resultin certain assets and liabilities and mainly comprise

(XVI)

of the transactions with GOSL and transactions withdomestic banks and financial institutions.Transactions with GOSL include the purchase of un-subscribed portions of Treasury bills and bonds thatare issued by the Government by the Bank as amonetary policy mechanism. Such purchases,disposals or interest thereon are reflected as merebook entries in the records of CBSL.

As the sole statutory authority, CBSL issues currencyto the public in line with Monetary Law Act.Currency issued by CBSL represents a claim on thebank in favour of the holder. This is a liability on thepart of the CBSL while it is an item of cash in thehands of the holder. Movement in circulationcurrency is included as part of financing activities inline with prevailing industry practice among thosecentral banks which present cash flow statements.

CBSL through the cash/pay order process disbursescash in the form of Notes and Coins or cheques drawnon CBSL, to various drawees including suppliers andemployees for goods and services obtained, whichis either added to the currency in circulation liabilityor Deposits by Banks and Financial Institutions. Suchforms of utilisation of currency for the purposes ofCBSL’s payments form part of cash outflows ofCBSL.

For the purposes of the Cash Flow Statement, cashand cash equivalents consist of cash and cashequivalents as defined above, net of cash/pay orderoutflows.

Repurchase and Reverse-RepurchaseTransactions

Securities sold under agreements to repurchasecontinue to be recorded as assets in the Balance Sheet.The obligation to repurchase (Securities Sold UnderAgreements to Repurchase) is disclosed as a liability.The difference between the sale and repurchase pricein repurchase transactions and the purchase price andsale price in reverse-repurchase transactionsrepresents an expense and income respectively andrecognised in the Income Statement.

Securities held under reverse-repurchase agreementsare recorded as an asset in the Balance Sheet(Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Re-sell).Both repurchase and reverse-repurchase transactionsare reported at the transaction value inclusive of anyaccrued income or expense.

Investment Portfolio – Sri Lanka GovernmentSecurities

The Bank’s investment portfolio consists of treasurybills and bonds purchased from Government of SriLanka. The portfolio is recorded in the Balance Sheet

at amortised cost since they represent loans providedto the GOSL.

Advances to Government

Advances to Government represents directprovisional advances made to Government of SriLanka under Section 89 of the Monetary Law ActNo 58 of 1949 of Sri Lanka, as amended.

Loans to Other Institutions

Loans granted to Other Institutions are recognisedand carried at the original granted amount less anallowance for any uncollectible amounts. Anallowance for doubtful debts (for loan impairment)is established if there is objective evidence that theBank will not be able to collect all amounts due. Theamount of the allowance is the difference betweenthe carrying amount and the estimated recoverableamount. Bad debts are written off when identified.

Securities Lending

Transfer of securities to counterparties under lendingtransactions is only reflected on the balance sheet ifthe risks and rewards of ownership are alsotransferred.

Impairment of Financial Assets

The Bank assesses at each balance sheet date whethera financial asset is impaired.

Assets carried at Amortised Cost

If there is objective evidence that an impairment losson loans and receivables carried at amortised costhas been incurred, the amount of the loss is measuredas the difference between the asset’s carrying amountand the present value of estimated future cash flows(excluding future credit losses that have not beenincurred) discounted at the financial asset’s originaleffective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest ratecomputed at initial recognition). The carrying amountof the asset shall be reduced either directly or throughuse of an allowance account. The amount of the lossshall be recognised in the Income Statement.

The Bank first assesses whether objective evidenceof impairment exists individually for financial assetsthat are individually significant, and individually orcollectively for financial assets that are notindividually significant. If it is determined that noobjective evidence of impairment exists for anindividually assessed financial asset, whethersignificant or not, the asset is included in a group offinancial assets with similar credit risk characteristicsand that group of financial assets is collectivelyassessed for impairment. Assets that are individuallyassessed for impairment and for which an impairment

loss is or continues to be recognised are not includedin a collective assessment of impairment.

If, in a subsequent period, the amount of theimpairment loss decreases and the decrease can berelated objectively to an event occurring after theimpairment was recognised, the previouslyrecognised impairment loss is reversed. Anysubsequent reversal of an impairment loss isrecognised in the income statement, to the extent thatthe carrying value of the asset does not exceed itsamortised cost at the reversal date.

Available-for-Sale Investments

If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amountcomprising the difference between its cost (net ofany principal payment and amortisation) and itscurrent fair value, less any impairment loss previouslyrecognized in profit or loss, is transferred from equityto the income statement. Reversals in respect ofequity instruments classified as available-for-sale arenot recognised in profit. Reversals of impairmentlosses on debt instruments are reversed through profitor loss, if the increase in fair value of the instrumentcan be objectively related to an event occurring afterthe impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss.

Foreign Currency Term Liabilities

Foreign currency term liabilities are subsequentlyreported at the amortised cost of the liabilities.Changes in the value of these liabilities are recognisedas an increase or decrease in the value of the termliabilities in the Balance Sheet. Gains and lossesarising from changes in value of foreign currencyterm liabilities are recognised immediately asexpenses in the Income Statement. Where theliability is still owed, the gain or loss is reported as(Gain) /Loss from Unrealised Price Revaluation.Where the gain or loss has been realised (throughrepayment of the liability), this is reported as (Gains)/Losses Realised from Price Changes.

Financial Guarantees

Financial Guarantees are initially recognised in thefinancial statements at fair value, under OtherPayables at fair value. Subsequent to initialrecognition, the Bank’s liability under each guaranteeis measured at the best estimate of expenditurerequired to settle any financial obligation arising asa result of the guarantee.

Other Financial Assets and Liabilities

Local and foreign currency cash, deposits and short-term advances are recognised on trade date.

1.4.3 Other Assets and Liabilities

Investments in Associates

The Bank’s investments in associates, together withthe ones that are held for subsequent disposals areaccounted for under cost method.

Gold Inventory

Gold inventory which is a highly liquid commodityis carried at cost.

Inventories

Inventories are carried at lower of cost and netrealisable value. Cost is determined on a weightedaverage basis. Allowance is made for slow movinginventories.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, Plant and Equipment is stated at cost,excluding the costs of day-to-day servicing, lessaccumulated depreciation and accumulatedimpairment in value. Such cost includes the cost ofreplacing part of such Property, Plant and Equipmentwhen that cost is incurred if the recognition criteriaare met. Land and buildings are measured at fair valueless depreciation on Buildings and impairmentcharged subsequent to the date of the revaluation.

Except for the freehold land, depreciation iscalculated on a straight line method over thefollowing estimated useful lives.

Class of AssetUseful LifeBuildings on Freehold LandsOver 50 YearsBuildings on Lease Hold lands Over the LeasePeriodPlant & Plant Integrals20 YearsFurniture & Equipments10 YearsMotor Vehicles5 YearsComputer Hardware4 YearsOthers3 Years

The carrying values of plant and equipment arereviewed for impairment when events or changes incircumstances indicate that the carrying value maynot be recoverable. Following initial recognition atcost, land and buildings are carried at a revaluedamount, which is the fair value at the date of therevaluation less any subsequent accumulateddepreciation on buildings and subsequentaccumulated impairment losses.

Valuations are performed frequently enough to ensurethat the fair value of a revalued asset does not differmaterially from its carrying amount.

Any revaluation surplus is credited to the RevaluationReserve included in the equity section of the BalanceSheet, except to the extent that it reverses arevaluation decrease of the same asset previouslyrecognised in Income Statement, in which case theincrease is recognised in Income Statement. Arevaluation deficit is recognised in Income Statement,except that a deficit directly offsetting a previoussurplus on the same asset is directly offset againstthe surplus in the Revaluation Reserve. Upondisposal, any revaluation surplus relating to theparticular asset being sold is transferred to retainedearnings. An item of Property, Plant and Equipmentis de-recognised upon disposal or when no futureeconomic benefits are expected from its use ordisposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognitionof the asset (calculated as the difference between thenet disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of theasset) is included in the Income Statement in the yearthe asset is de-recognised. The asset’s residual values,useful lives and methods are reviewed, and adjustedif appropriate, regularly.

Intangible Assets

Computer software not integral to computer hardwareare shown as intangible assets and recognized at cost.Following initial recognition these intangible assetsare carried at cost less any accumulated amortizationbased on a useful life of 4 years.

Receivables

Receivables are carried at expected realisable valueafter making due allowance for doubtful debts, basedon objective evidence.

Sundry Assets

Sundry assets are carried at expected realisablevalues.

Impairment of Non-Financial Assets

The Bank assesses at each reporting date if events orchanges in circumstances indicate that the carryingvalue may be impaired, whether there is an indicationthat a non-financial asset may be impaired. If anysuch indication exists, the Bank makes an estimateof the asset’s recoverable amount. Where the carryingamount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount,the asset is considered impaired and is written downto its recoverable amount.

Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Bank has apresent obligation (legal or constructive) as a resultof a past event, it is probable that an outflow ofresources embodying economic benefits will be

required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimatecan be made of the amount of the obligation. Wherethe Bank expects a provision to be reimbursed, thereimbursement is recognised as a separate asset butonly when the reimbursement is virtually certain.

Currency in Circulation

5.1Implementation of Monetary Policy

(a)Open Market Operations (OMO)

The department continued to conduct OMObased on the framework of market basedmonetary policy operations introduced in 2003within a corridor of interest rates formed byrepurchase (Repo) and reverse repurchase(Reverse Repo) rates of the Central Bank. OMOconsisted of several operations, (i) conductingdaily auctions either for Repo transactions toabsorb excess liquidity or Reverse Repotransactions to inject liquidity, if there is ashortage of liquidity, on a daily basis, (ii)provisions of Repo and Reverse Repo facilities

under standing facilities and (iii) conductingoutright sales of Treasury bills or purchases ofboth Treasury bills (in the primary and secondarymarkets) and Treasury bonds (in the secondarymarket) at the discretion of the Central Bank toinduce permanent absorption or injection ofliquidity. The eligible Participating Institutions(PIs) in OMO until 19 June 2006 were allcommercial banks and primary dealers.Thereafter the eligible institutions were limitedonly to licensed commercial banks. The CentralBank increased its policy rates, Repo andReverse Repo rates, by 125 basis points in foursteps from 8.75 per cent and 10. 25 per cent to10.00 per cent and 11.50 per cent respectively.

Liquidity in the banking system which was at asurplus during the first half of the year graduallydeclined and turned into a deficit towards theend of the year (CHART II - 1).

were offered for the auction and it amounted to94.00 percent of the estimated excess liquidity.The weighted average yield rate at the auctionwhich was around 9.29 per cent and at the lowerbound of the corridor at the beginning of the year,increased gradually towards the upper bound ofthe corridor by the end of the year, following theupward revision of policy rates and the liquidityshortage prevailed in the banking system in thelatter part of the year. The weighted average yieldrate was about 11.00 per cent by the end of theyear (CHART II - 2).

The liquidity surplus during the first half of theyear was largely increased due to the release ofprovisional advances to the government and netinflows of foreign exchange. The liquidityshortage in the latter part of the year was mainlydue to foreign exchange transactions of the CBSLin domestic foreign exchange market andincrease in currency in circulation, arising onseasonal demand. The Bank engaged inconducting OMO to absorb or inject liquidity asand when required.

(i) Daily Auctions Under OMO

Repo Transactions

The department continued to conduct auctionsfor Repo transactions to absorb temporaryliquidity surplus in the banking system on a dailybasis. The excess liquidity recorded on mostdays during the year was absorbed through thedaily auctions by selling Treasury bills onrepurchase basis. On average about Rs. 7.4 bn.

Reverse Repo Transactions

Daily auctions for Reverse Repo transactionswere continued to conduct till June 2006, toprovide liquidity whenever the liquidity in thebanking system fall into a short position. In viewof the continued excessive expansion inmonetary aggregates in June 2006, conductingof auctions for Reverse Repo was discontinuedand allowed the market to operate closer to theupper bound of the interest rate corridor.However, auctions for Reverse Repos werereintroduced in September, 2006 to conduct itonly when it is deemed necessary. Weightedaverage rate of the auctions held were in theupper bound of the corridor due to large liquidityshortage prevailed in that period.

(ii) Standing Facilities

Standing facilities were continued to be anavenue for those PIs, which were unable tomanage their short term liquidity requirementsfully through the inter bank money market andor at the daily auctions under OMO. Thesefacilities were provided at the Repo and ReverseRepo rates of the Central Bank

entire excess funds to lend in money market dueto, self imposed limits of banks on their interbankoperations, resorted to standing facilities at theRepo rate of the Central Bank. However, asauctions for Repo transactions were conductedto absorb almost full amount of excess liquidityin the banking system due to excessive monetaryexpansion continued during the year, the use ofstanding facility for Repo transactions declinedsubstantially during the year.

Reverse Repo Transactions

The Reverse Repo Facility (RRF) of the Bankas a standing facility is available to the PIs tomeet their liquidity needs and is designed to beaccessed as a last resort. However, it wasobserved that certain banks have resorted to theuse of RRF as a regular source of funding. Itwas also noted that PIs have used the facilityeven when the liquidity is broadly in balance orthe market operates with relatively on a smallsurplus. In view of the continued excessiveexpansion in monetary aggregates during theyear, and considering the ill effect of continuousexcessive borrowings in June 2006, the Bankdecided to discontinue the auctions for reverserepurchases, and to discourage the use of CentralBank funds under the standing facility on regularbasis through moral suasion. PIs were advisedto limit the use of standing facility to it only as alast resort and confine their operations to theresources available, through appropriateadjustments in their balance sheets.

The availability of standing facility wassuspended with effect from 26 September 2006and a decision was taken to conduct dailyauctions for Reverse Repo transactions toprovide liquidity to the banking system when itis deemed necessary. However, the standingfacility was recommenced on 28 September2006. Further, the Bank decided to discontinueReverse Repos under standing facility when thereis a liquidity surplus in the banking system asper the Central Bank estimates with effect from01 January 2007.

(iii) Outright Transactions

The Central Bank engaged in conductingauctions to sell Treasury bills outright out of itsown portfolio, to absorb excess liquidity on apermanent basis. During the year Bank soldTreasury bills to the total value of Rs. 34.9 bn.through auctions. These Treasury bills were veryshort term with number of remaining days tomaturity ranging from 10 to 46 days. These sales

were at yield rates, which were below the ratecomparable with the prevailing weighted averageyield rates for 91 days Treasury bills in theprimary market at the time of each outright sale.

(b)Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR)

The department continued to enforce SRR whichremained at 10.00 per cent of deposit liabilitiesof commercial banks, denominated in Sri Lankarupees.

(c)Bank Rate

The Central Bank’s rate of interest (Bank Rate)on short term advances to licensed commercialbanks, stipulated under Section 87 of theMonetary Law Act, remained unchanged at 15.00per cent. However, this rate was inoperativesince no bank resorted to borrow from the CentralBank at the Bank Rate.

5.2Maintaining Banking Services to CommercialBanks and the Government

(a)Accounts of Financial Institutions

further strengthening the monetary policy decision-making process. The Department played its most vitalrole of facilitating on the deliberations of the MonetaryPolicy Committee (MPC) by providing acomprehensive analysis of economic and monetarysector developments.

In this sense, ERD functioned not only as a watch-dog of price stability, but also as an initiator ofappropriate monetary policy to attain the same goal.In addition, ERD staff continued to undertake researchin subjects of contemporary importance, some ofwhich were published in the “Staff Studies” editedby ERD. These rsearch papers were;

After extensive studies on the serious macroeconomicimplications of sharp volatility in oil prices, thedepartment recommended the CPC to enter intohedging arrangements when purchasing petroleumproducts from the international market. ERD prepareda presentation on “ Maintaining Stability in a VolatileGlobal Oil Market” which was presented by theGovernor to the Cabinet of Ministers. Consequently,with the approval of the Cabinet, the CPC was ableto commence hedging part of its oil requirements inFebruary 2007.

The staff of ERD was also engaged in conducting jointresearch with international organizations, such asSEACEN Centre, and SAARCFINANCE. Severalsenior officers of ERD served on various importantcommittees, both within and outside the Bank. Duringthe year, three rounds of negotiations were held withthe Indian authorities on a Comprehensive EconomicPartnership Agreement (CEPA) with India. The ERDstaff also served as directors on the Boards of severalkey institutions, and as resource persons in trainingprogrammes conducted by the Centre for BankingStudies (CBS) as well as by other foreign and localorganizations.

ERD actively contributed to the formulation of theBank’s Strategic Plan for 2007 - 11, especially in thecore area of economic and price stability. It alsodeveloped a Core Inflation measure to identify the

6.ECONOMIC RESEARCH

During the year, the Economic Research Department(ERD) continued to perform its key function as the‘Economic Think Tank’ in the Central Bank. Thisjob required it to collect and analyse economic andsocial statistics and conduct policy oriented economicresearch for the guidance of the Monetary Board andthe management of the Central Bank. Its researchpapers were an essential input for formulating,implementing, and executing monetary policy and forperforming Central Bank’s function as the economicadvisor to the government. ERD released socio-economic data and information regularly to thegeneral public through the Bank’s statutorypublications. In addition, timely and updatedeconomic data were released to the markets throughthe publication of weekly and monthly selectedeconomic indicators which were posted in the CentralBank website as well. ERD continued to issue regularmonthly press releases on International Trade andMonetary Policy Review in 2006. In addition, anumber of press releases were also issued from timeto time clarifying various important economic issuesof interest to the general public.

Research activities were focused primarily on theformulation and implementation of monetary policy,followed by the appropriate design andimplementation of other domestic and external sectorpolicies. In this regard, an emphasis was placed on

The total value of ILF drawn during the yearwas Rs. 538.6 bn. compared to Rs. 543.0 bn. duringthe previous year. The average value of ILF drawingper day was around Rs. 2.1 bn. (CHART II - 3). Themeasures in place, including penalty interest at theBank Rate and the suspension of the facility forrepeated defaults has ensured the prompt reversal ofILF before the close of business of LankaSettle.

price behaviour influenced by nominal demandfactors. This measure, free from seasonal variationof prices, provides an indicator for taking appropriatemonetary policy measures by the Bank. In addition, aVector Auto Regression (VAR) model and AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA) model weredeveloped to improve the inflation forecasting as aforerunner for adopting inflation targeting as theBank’s key monetary policy strategy.

Preparing the Bank’s statutory reports and otherspecial reports in all three languages is a primaryresponsibility of ERD. The department coordinatedthe publication of the Bank’s Annual Report for 2005,Recent Economic Developments - Highlights of 2006and Prospects for 2007, and 12 monthly bulletins in2006. ERD prepared a booklet titled ‘Sri Lanka: NowIs the Time’ to increase the awareness of theinternational investors on the investment opportunitiesavailable in Sri Lanka, facilities and incentives offeredto inventors by several public sector agencies and onrecent economic developments in the country. Inaddition, ERD prepared several statutory reports,which the Central Bank is required to submit to theMinister of Finance under the provisions of theMonetary Law Act. ERD has continuously beeneducating the general public on key macro economicvariables.

ERD, on behalf of the Bank and the Government,continued to coordinate relations with internationalmultilateral financial organizations.

7.2Investment Activities and Returns

During the year, the total investment portfolio of theFund grew by 14.8 per cent, to Rs 465 billion, fromRs. 405 bn in 2005 (TABLE II - 4). At the end of theyear, 96.8 per cent of the total EPF investmentportfolio was in gilt-edged government securities, dueto the non-availability of acceptable alternativeinvestments with low risk. However, market interestrates did not adjust promptly to widely fluctuatinginflation rates. As such, the Fund was not able todeclare a positive real return on a yearly basis.

The investments in Treasury Bonds, a long-termmarketable investment instrument, had increased to85 per cent of the total investment portfolio at end2006, as against 83 per cent in the previous year. Theinvestments in Government Rupee securities, a non-marketable instrument, were further reduced to 12 percent of the portfolio from 14 per cent at end 2005.

The realised returns from equity investments, in termsof capital gains and dividends, during 2006 amountedto Rs 435 mn, recording a return of 13.25 per cent,while the total return including the unrealised capitalgains, amounted to 35.15 per cent (TABLE II- 5).During the entire investment period of nine years from1998 to 2006, the EPF earned a healthy return of 20per cent, on average, from the equity investmentportfolio, which constituted only 0.8 per cent of thetotal EPF portfolio as at end 2006.

Capital gains realised from government securitiesdeclined in 2006 compared to 2005 due to non-conducive market conditions. The yields ongovernment securities moved up as a result of severalpolicy rate increases and the escalating inflationduring the year. The capital gains realized fromTreasury bills and bonds declined marginally and therealized capital gains from the equity portfoliodecreased by 61 per cent to Rs. 320 mn in 2006, fromRs 817 mn recorded in 2005. High unrealized capitalgain of Rs. 719 as at end of December 2006 is a resultof holding shocks to build a long term equity Portfoliofor realizing long term gains. (TABLE II - 6).

7.3Total Member Balance and Rate of Interest for2006

The total member balance of the EPF grew by 15 percent during the year to record a value of Rs 477 bn asat end 2006, after accounting for the declared interestrate of 10.1 per cent to be declared to members forthe year. In accordance with the statutory requirementof the Fund to pay the interest on the entire balance,including the contributions received during the year,the effective rate of interest is estimated at 10.2 percent per annum, which is 3.5 per cent higher than theAverage Weighted Deposit Rate (AWDR) of 6.80 percent paid by commercial banks. Although it is notfeasible for the EPF to declare a positive real effectivereturn to members annually, the EPF is striving toprovide a positive real effective rate of return tomembers on a cumulative basis.

7.4Member Disclosures

The semi-annual member statements for the secondhalf of 2005 were issued to members through theiremployers during September 2006. The posting ofsemi-annual member statements for the first half of2006 was initiated in December.

7.5Housing Loan Facilities

A facility has been available from 1988 for EPFmembers to obtain a loan for housing purposes fromapproved lending institutions keeping their EPFbalances as collateral. In addition, a second loan isalso available upon the successful settlement of thefirst loan.

During 2006, the EPF issued 15,136 member balancecertifications for a total approved credit volume ofRs 3,049 mn. (TABLE II - 7). However, in spite ofthe lending institutions charging a penal rate of about36 per cent per annum on the amounts defaulted, themembers continued to default the repayment of theseloans. This has compelled the Fund to deduct and payto the lending institutions the defaulted amount,together with a penal interest from the relevant EPFmember’s account, resulting in an aggressive erosionof retirement benefits to the members concerned. Thedefaulters are not entitled to a second loan or a loanat 4 per cent interest rate under the Shramodha HomeLoan Scheme.

The EPF successfully implemented the SAPInvestment Module, which is a complete EnterpriseResource Planning (ERP) solution, providing EPFwith strategic insight, ability to differentiate andincrease productivity. It is a service-oriented businesssolution helping to align people, information, andbusiness processes across organizational andtechnological boundaries.

The EPF website (www.epf.lk) was redesigned andlaunched in October 2006 to provide more informationto the public in all three languages. The upgradedwebsite also includes renewed features to provide abetter interaction with stakeholders. This websiteprovides facilities for the members and the employersto download Forms related to the EPF and includes aFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section. A facilityexists to submit any other queries, whereby therelevant officer can get back with the requestedinformation. General information regarding other EPFprocedures are incorporated in the website.

The EPF also commenced a project, with theconcurrence of the Labour Department, to collectcontributions from larger employers with more than150 employees on monthly basis through electronicmedia, thereby facilitating real time updating ofmember accounts. This system will expedite therefund process and the issuance of housing loancertificates. The fund expects to get more employersinto this system during 2007. The emphasis placedon promoting the process of collecting membercontribution data through electronic media resultedin 41 new employers joining the system, increasingthe total number of such employers to 254.

In order to address numerous operational problemsthat had risen due to the maintenance of twoindependent databases on employer and memberrecords by the Labour Department and the EPF, theFund continued to undertake its re-engineeringprogramme to collect its member information anddevelop a clear database without ambiguities whichis critical for the smooth operation of the EPF and toprovide an efficient and effective service to itsmembers. Prior to the re-registration of the currentcontributing members, with a view to introducing aunique member identification number, a pilot projectwas carried out to ascertain the feasibility of theimplementation of the scheme. The pilot projectcovered employers in three sectors, namely estate,services and industries.

10. INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

10.1 Foreign Exchange Reserves Management

International Operations Department (IOD) isentrusted with the responsibility of managing theofficial foreign exchange reserves of the country tofacilitate maintenance of external stability of the SriLanka rupee and ensure required freedom in country’sinternational transactions. The Monetary Law Actrequires the Central Bank to maintain an adequateinternational reserves in liquid currencies and anuclear reserve in gold, in order to achieve the aboveobjective.

In 2006, the foreign exchange reserves were heldmainly in US dollars, euros, sterling pounds,Australian dollars and gold. In terms of assets, thereserves were invested in two main asset classes,namely, money market instruments and fixed incomesecurities of highly rated sovereign governmentsecurities, government guaranteed securities andsecurities of government agencies and supranationalinstitutions. Liquidity requirements were fulfilledthrough the maintenance of a sufficient proportion ofreserves in highly liquid short-term instruments ofboth asset classes. The transactions on investmentswere performed only through highly rated andapproved counterparties within the limit structureapproved by the management, paying dueconsideration to safety, liquidity and return on suchassets.

Investments of foreign exchange reserves were donein accordance with the guidelines approved by theMonetary Board. The Foreign Reserves ManagementCommittee (FRMC) supervised the overall operation

(XXXVIII)

Accounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

of foreign exchange reserves management veryclosely and provided necessary guidance asappropriate during the year.

During the year 2006, the financial markets wereinfluenced by episodes of record high oil pricesreaching over US$ 78 per barrel (the benchmark WestTexas Intermediary Brand). Global headline inflationpicked up in response to high oil prices and, as a result,rising of interest rates were experienced by almost alleconomies. This created continuously challengingenvironment for reserves management operationsspecially with the valuation changes of the existinginvestments. To meet this challenge, IOD madenecessary changes to currency and asset compositionof the international reserves from time to time afterreviewing the possible changes in the market/economic fundamentals in selected currencies/countries. Bank’s foreign exchange obligations in theimmediate future, and income generating abilitiesplayed a major role in determining the portfoliocomposition of the international reserves.

Overall reserve management operations havegenerated a net foreign exchange income of US$ 100.5million or Rs. 10,453.4 million during the year 2006,exceeding the budgeted income of US$ 86.6 millionand the income of the previous year amounting to US$77.0 million. The official foreign exchange reservesof the country has grown from US$ 2,257.0 millionto US$ 2,323.0 million during this period, reflectinga net inflow of US$ 66 million. The increase in theincome is the combined outcome of the increases inthe level of reserves and interest rates.

10.2 Risk Management

The risks associated with the foreign exchangereserves and their investments are monitored by theMiddle Office of the IOD. The foreign exchangereserves and their investments are exposed to variouscategories of risks. Among these risk categories,foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk,liquidity risk and operational risk are considered asmajor components.

Foreign exchange risk or the risk of capital loss as aconsequence of fluctuations in exchange rates ismanaged mainly through diversification of investmentcurrencies. Interest rate risk or the exposure of theBank’s reserves portfolio to movements in the interestrate was managed through the appropriate adjustmentof the duration of the portfolio. Counterparty CreditRisk Management System (CCRMS) is used by theIOD to minimize the credit risk. The liquidity riskwhich is the risk of incurring capital losses in the eventof forced liquidation is managed by establishingliquidity requirements. The operational risk resultingfrom human error, flawed systems and inadequateprocedures and controls were managed through arange of measures.

The IOD is in the process of developing an improvedcustomized benchmark in order to better communicatethe Bank’s risk appetite and investment objectives aswell as to enhance the performance evaluationapproach of foreign reserves management activities.

10.3 Monitoring the Domestic Foreign ExchangeMarket Developments

IOD continued to closely watch the domestic foreignexchange market, foreign exchange transactions andovernight net foreign exchange open positions ofcommercial banks with a view to promoting thesmooth functioning of the domestic foreign exchangemarket and to ensure an orderly adjustment of theexchange rate of Sri Lanka.

The US dollar/rupee rate which stood at Rs.102.12 atthe end of December 2005 depreciated to Rs.107.71at the end of 2006, recording a depreciation by 5.19percent during the year, as against the appreciation of2.44 percent in 2005. Given the relative strengtheningof other major currencies in the international market,the rupee depreciated against all major currenciesexcept for Japanese yen.

The volume of inter-bank foreign exchangetransactions increased to US dollars 10,792 millionfrom US dollars 7,245 million in 2005 recording a33 percent growth during the year. In 2006, Sri Lankaoperated in an environment mired by volatileexchange rates and higher expectation of inflationarypressures brought about mainly by high oil prices andresultant escalation of expenditure on imports. Thishas necessitated the Central Bank to be on both sidesof the market to moderate the excessive volatility inthe exchange rate of Sri Lanka rupee. The Bankabsorbed foreign exchange amounting to US dollar307 million from the domestic foreign exchangemarket, while the injection of foreign exchange to themarket amounted to US dollar 791 million, duringthe year.

As a result of the initiatives taken by the Sri LankaForex Association along with the CBSL, the domesticforeign exchange market has adopted the ACI(Association Cambiste Internationale) Model Codein the domestic foreign exchange market.

10.4 Operating Instructions, Circulars and Directionsissued during 2006

A new direction on LKR Options was issued to thedomestic foreign exchange market during the year.Under these guidelines Authorized Foreign ExchangeDealers were allowed to offer Sri Lanka Rupee (LKR)based Cross Currency options subject to certainconditions.

(i)The prospects of all the countries having theirown RTGS System in place seem a medium orlong-term endeavor. As a near term measure,the interfacing of the ACU payment system withthe payment and settlement platform providedby the SWIFT can be explored.

13.6 Payment System Policy and Oversight

The Payment and Settlement Systems Act No.28 of2005 (PSSA) which came into force on May 11, 2006assigned the responsibility and statutory powers forthe Central Bank to perform a wide range of activitiesfrom the formulation of payment system policy toenforcement of such policy. The PSD geared toperform the task of policy formulation with therepresentatives of the National Payment Council(NPC), the highest decision making body whichcomprises representatives of all stakeholders of thepayment and settlement systems. Accordingly, thePSD was involved in formulating the draft nationalpayment and settlement system vision, policy andaction plan for the next four year period (2007 - 2010).The PSSA provides the required statutoryresponsibilities and powers for PSD to carry outpayment system oversight in a more effective mannerto foster safety and efficiency of the payment andsettlement system. The move of the Central Bank topublish the payment system policy and 4 year actionplan, and follow up the said policy framework willprovide a predictable environment for market playersto plan ahead and take the advantage in the paymentindustry.

The PSD prepared the General Direction issued bythe Central Bank to LankaClear (Pvt) Ltd andparticipants of the Cheque Imaging and Truncation(CIT) System, providing the legal recognition toelectronic cheque presentment and operation of theCIT System.

The PSD played an active role in upgrading theLankaSettle System, testing its readiness at thedisaster recovery site (DRS), improving the businesscontinuity planning and updating the LankaSettleSystem Rules to meet changing needs. LankaSettleSystem availability which recorded 99.54 per centshowed that LankaSettle was operated reliably in2006.

On a request of participants a circular was issued toLankaSettle participants in 2006, requesting them tohave norms and standards in settlement of interparticipant transactions in the LankaSettle System.Accordingly paying participants should ensuresettlement of all future value dated transactions in theSystem by 10.00 a.m. on the value date and effectsame day value transactions for money market andforeign exchange transactions (rupee leg) within twohours of entering into such transactions.

With the introduction of ‘Default Charge’ in 2005,the liquidity management of participants in the RTGSSystem to ensure smooth settlement of net clearing

balances improved. The number of occasions offailure of participants to keep adequate funds in theirRTGS Settlement Accounts declined from 10 in 2005to 4 in 2006. The PSD developed a set of BusinessContinuity Plan Guidelines which were issued by theCentral Bank in March 2006. The BCP guidelinesprovide the appropriate minimum standards of BCPto LankaSettle participants and payment systemoperators such as LankaClear (Pvt) Ltd. In itsassessment of BCPs of participants of LankaSettleSystem received in September 2006, PSD found thatmost of the participants have attempted to improvetheir BCPs. But the non-availability of SWIFTconnectivity at the DRS of participants was a causeof concern. Therefore, PSD emphasized theimportance of having SWIFT connectivity at the DRSof participants. In response, the SWIFT user grouphas established a local SWIFT service bureau toprovide a common connectivity for users tocommunicate with SWIFTNet.

The PSD continued its dialogues with other paymentsystem operators and participants in a cooperativeenvironment and collected information periodicallyfrom them to monitor and oversee the payment andsettlement systems and for publishing the ‘PaymentsBulletin quarterly’.

14. PREMISES

The Premises Department continued to carry out themaintenance and upkeep of the Bank’s premisesduring the year 2006, in addition to providing supportservices such as transport and communicationfacilities to officers of the Bank.

Most of the maintenance work and a part of thetransport services have been outsourced with a viewto obtaining services more efficiently and at lowestcost.

By the end of 2006, the Premises Departmentcompleted its landscaping project at the front portionof the Central Bank Head Office Building which wascommenced with a view to beautifying with bloomingand having sufficient greenery to make the areapleasant and pleasing to the eye.

The Premises Department awarded the tender forrepair and refurbishment of the Hostel Block at Centrefor Banking Studies (CBS) Rajagiriya to StateEngineering Corporation (SEC) in August, 2006,enabling the CBS for conducting Residential TrainingProgrammes for local and foreign participants fromvarious financial institutions. The work has alreadybeen commenced and will be expected to completethe project by the end of December, 2007.

The Department continued to maintain the LightHouse Clock Tower with a historic landmark valueadjacent to the Bank’s Head Office.

15. PUBLIC DEBT

The issuance and management of domestic debt,servicing of both domestic and foreign debt anddeveloping an efficient and liquid market forgovernment securities are the key functions of thePublic Debt Department (PDD). Accordingly, thePDD has to ensure that the government financingneeds are met at the lowest possible cost over mediumto long run with a prudent degree of risk and paymentobligations are met on time. During the year, severalinitiatives were taken to diversify and broad-base thegovernment securities market, strengthen the PrimaryDealer (PD) system and improve the debt marketinfrastructure. The Rupee denominated Treasury bondmarket was opened for foreign investors with effectfrom November 1, 2006 broadening the investor baseand increasing the competition in the bond market.In order to provide an opportunity for patriotic SriLankan citizens to participate in the developmentprocess and also to diversify the debt instruments, aretail type new sovereign debt instrument, Sri LankaNation Building Bonds (SLNBBs) was introduced inFebruary 2006. With a view to strengthening the PDsystem and to provide a cushion for the rising marketrisk, the minimum capital requirement for PrimaryDealers was further increased from Rs. 250 millionto Rs. 300 million with effect from July 1, 2006. Arisk weighted capital adequacy framework which wasbased on the internationally accepted Basle risk basedcapital framework was introduced for PDs.Bloomberg electronic trading platform was introducedin May, 2006 to enhance the efficiency of tradingthrough efficient price discovery in the secondarymarket for government securities. Similarly, with aview to further facilitating the development of thegovernment securities market, direct participant statuswas provided to Colombo Stock Exchange in January,2006.

15.1 Developments in 2006

Borrowing Targets and the Strategy

The total gross borrowing limit set under theAppropriation Act No. 39 of 2005, approved by theParliament for the year 2006 was Rs.548 billion. Ofthis, funds to be raised through the domestic sourcesamounted to Rs. 378 billion while the balance Rs.170 billion was expected to be raised from foreignsources. In the year 2006, the PDD mobilized a sumof Rs.348 billion through government securities

(XLIV)

Part II

programme as against a target of Rs. 338 billionenvisaged in the borrowing programme. Since theoriginal commercial foreign borrowing programmewas not implemented during the year as expected, apart of commercial type foreign borrowingprogramme was shifted to the domestic borrowingprogramme thereby slightly exceeding the originallyenvisaged targets under government securitiesprogramme. The approved Treasury bill limitremained unchanged at Rs. 300 billion during theyear.

The domestic debt management strategy adopted in2006 aimed at mobilizing funds through tradableinstruments such as Treasury bonds including Indexlinked bonds and Treasury bills. Of the total domesticresource mobilization, 77 per cent was on tradabledebt instruments such as Treasury bonds and Treasurybills. In respect of non tradable Rupee loans, therewas a net repayment of Rs. 19 billion reducing theoutstanding Rupee loan stock from 11 per cent in 2005to 08 per cent in 2006. As part of the debtmanagement strategy, the investor base of the debtmarket was further broadened by partly liberalizingthe capital account and opening up the Treasury bondmarket for foreign investors subject to a limit of 5per cent of the Treasury bonds outstanding. The entrybarriers for foreign investors such as minimumholding period of one year, restrictions on maturityperiod and use of bonds for Repo transactions wereremoved in early part of 2007 to attract more investors.A new debt instrument called SLNBBs wasintroduced in early 2006 mainly targeting Sri Lankancommunity working abroad.

It has been observed that there is a considerablebunching of debt stock on the shorter end of thematurity profile. Of the existing domestic debt, 24percent is estimated to be maturing within one-yearperiod while 86 percent is estimated to be maturingwithin a 3-year period. The analysis shows that boththe average maturity period of domestic debt(instruments based rupee debt) and ‘duration’ of suchdebt declined in the past few years. Havingrecognized the urgent need to address the emergingbunching problem and resulting rollover risk, the PDDinitiated action to develop an appropriate debtconsolidation plan through buy back operations, asused in most developed debt markets which isexpected to be implemented in 2007.

15.2 Issuance

In 2006, the PDD conducted 52 Treasury bill auctionsand issued a sum of Rs. 628 billion in gross termsand new issues of Rs. 24 billion in net terms.Reflecting the strong market preference towards the

short term bills, 64 percent of the total gross issueswere for maturities of less than or equal to 91 dayTreasury bills. The PDD was able to raise Rs. 310billion through Treasury bond programme byconducting 70 auctions as well as making privateplacements. Fifty four percent of the total issues ofTreasury bonds were for more than 3 year maturitieswhich helped to extend the duration of the debt stock.In addition to the conventional type Treasury bonds,Index linked bonds of Rs.6 billion were issued in June2006. PDD took measures to address highfragmentation in the bond market in 2006. Itcontinued the policy of reopening the existingTreasury bond series, that helped to reduce the totalnumber of series of Treasury bonds from 56 at end2005 to 53 at end 2006.

Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) were issuedthrough three consecutive auctions namely; June,August and September 2006. All three auctions wereoversubscribed and a total of USD 580 million wasraised with two year (USD 320 million) and three year(USD 260 million) maturities. The interest cost ofthese bond issues were six month LIBOR plus amargin of 132 basis points for 2 year tenure and sixmonth LIBOR plus 141 basis points for 3 year tenure.

In the meantime, a foreign commercial borrowingthrough a syndicated loan amounting to USD 100million with the tenure of 3 years and at a rate of sixmonths LIBOR plus 75 basis points was obtained tomitigate the pressure on domestic debt securitiesmarket and to stabilize the rate structure. The CitiBank N.A. acted as the lead manager for this bondissue.

Rising interest rates for government securities fuelledby rising inflation and due to a shift of a part of theoriginal foreign commercial borrowing programmeto the domestic borrowing programme created aheavy pressure on the overall domestic borrowingprogramme in 2006. Especially, during the secondhalf of the year, the increase in yield rates in primaryand secondary markets was significant withuncertainty prevailing in the market due to breakdownof peace negotiations and in the wake of risinginflation. In order to mitigate the undue pressure oninterest rates at auctions, government relied more onnon-auction type borrowing by raising funds frominstitutional investors.

The increasing trend in interest rates also shifted theinvestor appetite to the shorter end of the market. Thisresulted in changing the acceptance pattern at theprimary auctions. Towards the end of the year, about69 percent of accepted volume of Treasury bills atprimary auctions was 91 day bills. This has resultedin an increase in the size of weekly auctions andincreased rollover risk. It also reduced the durationof the public debt portfolio from 1.87 years in 2005to 1.83 (up to September) years in 2006. Further, awide divergence in the interest rates between primaryand secondary markets resulted in the secondarymarket activities getting dried up, which in turnreduced the normal resource flow to primary market.This caused further pressure on the primary auctions.

15.3 Debt Service Payments

During the year, the PDD serviced both foreign anddomestic debt which amounted to Rs. 445 billion.Total debt service payments on domestic debtamounted to Rs. 385 billion while total foreign debtservice payments, which stood at Rs. 60 billionrecorded an increase of Rs. 35 billion over theprevious year. This increase was mainly on accountof lower debt service payments in 2005 due to thedebt moratorium received during 2005 on account ofTsunami and commencement of usual foreign debtservice payments according to the loan agreementsentered into in 2006. The depreciation of Rupeeagainst foreign currencies can also be cited as theother reason for the increase in external debt servicepayments in 2006.

15.4 Yield Rates and the Secondary MarketPerformance

The yield rates on government securities whichremained stable during the first half of 2006, increasedsignificantly during the latter part of the year. Higherrate of inflation and high inflationary expectations inthe market, upward revision of the CBSL policy rates(by 125 bps), and additional borrowing pressure thatemerged in the government securities market due toshifting of part of the original foreign borrowingprogramme to the domestic borrowing programme,were the main reasons for this sharp increase in theinterest rates. Treasury bill yields increased by 266,244 and 261 basis points for 91, 182 and 364 daymaturities respectively, between December 2005 andDecember 2006, while those for Treasury bonds witha maturity period of 2-3 years increased by a rangeof 150-175 basis points during the same period.Secondary market activities in government securitiesdeclined further by 5.6 percent during 2006. Notablefeatures were the significant increase in activitiesrelating to Repo/Reverse repo market and sharpdecline in outright sales and purchases which clearlyreflects the investors preference to deal on the shorterend of the yield curve.

15.5 Primary Dealer Supervision

The PDD continued to supervise PD activities throughoff-site surveillance and on-site examinations. Sixregular on-site examinations were carried out duringthe year and continuously engaged in off-sitesurveillance activities by reviewing financialstatements and monitoring PD performance in primaryand secondary markets.

Risk Weighted Capital Adequacy Framework(RWCAF) for PDs has been introduced with effectfrom July, 1. 2006. RWCAF covers the capitalrequired for market risk in the trading portfolio aswell as reverse repos, additional capital requirementdepending on the long and short positions of PDportfolio and counter party credit risks. The requiredRWCAF would be the higher of the minimum capitalrequirement of Rs. 300 million or its required riskweighted capital based on the risk position of thePDs. Under the RWCAF, required capital adequacyratio is 8 per cent of the risk weighted assets. Thedepartment has conducted a series of seminars anddiscussions to educate PDs on RWCAF.

The PDD introduced a mechanism to assess PDsbased on a criteria which is linked to theirperformance with the objective of encouraging PDsto upgrade themselves. The assessment is based onthe number of qualitative and quantitative factors such

Agriculture Sector

As mentioned earlier, the TDPRF and the SPCDPRFcommenced operations during the course of 2006 out ofthe recoveries of the ADB funded TDP and SPCDPprogrammes, in order to continue to support the tea andperennial crop sectors. Several PFIs which did notparticipate in the original TDP and SPCDP schemes wereenrolled under the revolving fund schemes to promote theflow of funds to these vital sectors. Action was also takenon the budget proposal to make it mandatory for all licensedcommercial banks and licensed specialized banks to allocate10 percent of their lending to agriculture, inclusive ofagriculture processing. For this purpose, the RDD is toexplore the possibility of establishing an Agricultural Fundto which banks which are unable to reach these targets couldcontribute the mandatory amount, and thereby satisfy therequirement.

Forward Sales Contract System

Forward Sales Contracts (FSCs), which are agreementssigned between buyers and farmers to trade selectedagricultural produce at pre-determined prices, wereintroduced in 1999, to protect farmers from sustaining lossesdue to depression of prices during the harvesting season.Under NCRCS, loans are provided to buyers who purchaseagricultural produce under FSCs. The RDD, together withthe Regional Offices (ROs), continued to promote FSCsby coordinating the activities of stakeholders, includingPFIs, buyers, farmers and farmer organizations in 2006 aswell. During 2005/06 Maha a total of 392 loans to the totalvalue of Rs. 1.3 bn. were provided to buyers to purchaseproduce under FSCs while in Yala 2006, 301 loans to thetotal value of Rs 1.3 bn were granted for this purpose. Themain crops for which FSCs were entered into were maize,soya beans, kurakkan, black gram and ginger. A total of27,000 acres had been cultivated with maize in theAnuradhapura district and the entire 54,000 metric tons ofmaize produced were sold under FSCs bringing an incomeof Rs. 900 million to farmers. Several awareness campaignson the FSC were also conducted during the year both bythe RDD and the Regional Offices of the Central Bank.

Small and Medium Enterprise Sector

During the year under review, the granting of refinance forSusahana and SBRP loan schemes, which had beenintroduced in 2005 to rehabilitate small, medium and microenterprises affected by the Tsunami, concluded. However,the demand for loans to rehabilitate Tsunami affectedenterprises still exists and it is expected that Contract B ofthe Post Tsunami Line of Credit will meet some of the needsof medium scale enterprises. It has also been decided toestablish a revolving fund out of recoveries of Susahanaloans to meet any further demand from Tsunami affectedenterprises. Further, as mentioned earlier, preliminary work

was concluded with respect to the new line of credit to beobtained from the French Government (Construction SectorDevelopment Project) for the purpose of providing financeto construction companies involved in post-tsunamiconstruction activities.

Micro Finance Sector

As mentioned earlier, granting of refinance in respect ofthe UNDP funded Jeewana Shakthi loan scheme concludedoperations during the year. The Small Farmer and LandlessCredit Scheme (SFLCP), which is a pilot micro financescheme operated by the RDD in the districts of Kandy,Puttalam, Galle and Matara, progressed successfully afterthe major administrative functions were handed over to thePeople’s Companies for Project Beneficiaries, which arecompanies formed by clustering beneficiary societies. TheReport on the Impact Assessment Survey of the SFLCPconducted in 2005 was published during the year. Theresults of this survey indicate that around 63 percent of thebeneficiary households sampled (the sample consisted ofbeneficiary households which had been in the SFLCP for 5years or more) had crossed the poverty line within a periodof 5 years or more. The best results in this regard werereported in the districts of Puttalam and Matara where morethan 75 percent of beneficiary households in the samplehad escaped from poverty. Improvements in livingstandards in terms of quality of housing, access to amenitiesand ownership of consumer durables and capital items wereobserved in all four districts. The survey also revealed thatan appreciable number of beneficiary households creditneeds have moved beyond the upper threshold formicrocredit of Rs. 50,000 and, therefore, their presentrequirement was credit on commercial terms. A surveycovering major indicators of wealth, ownership of consumerdurables and capital goods, housing conditions,indebtedness and savings was undertaken in December 2006using a sample of 754 beneficiaries of the PovertyAlleviation Micro Finance Project (PAMP) which is anotherpilot poverty alleviation project operated by the CentralBank in the districts of Kurunegala, Kalutara, Nuwara Eliya,Badulla, Matale and Hambantota. Preliminary informationon this survey indicates that 55 percent of beneficiaryhouseholds in the sample had escaped poverty. This is asalutary development as 88 percent of households sampledhad joined the PAMP scheme after 2004. It has been decidedto conduct this survey annually on the same sample ofbeneficiaries to build up panel data which would permitthe analysis of chronic poverty and transitory poverty amongbeneficiaries. During the year under review, the outreachof the PAMP programme expanded by 12,968 households.A more comprehensive Impact Assessment Survey on thePAMP in line with the survey conducted on the SFLCP isalso expected to be conducted in 2007.

The department also engagedin improving existing systems and developing newinformation systems including short term and mediumterm projections for economic growth and inflation.One of the major achievements of the Departmentduring the year was the extension of its operationsinto new areas such as conducting land price surveys,business confidence surveys and inflation expectationsurveys. In addition, the Department activelyparticipated in the public awareness programme ofthe CBSL as a source of resource persons, for trainingprogrammes, seminars and media discussions duringthe reference year. Many officers in both staff andnon-staff grades participated in both local and foreigntraining programmes, workshops and seminars tofurther their knowledge and skills during the yearwhich enabled them to improve the quality andproductivity of the Department.

Statistical Surveys

The Department initiated a programme to collect assetprices to meet the requirements of the FinancialSystem Stability Committee (FSSC) as well as toexpand the Bank’s data coverage. As an initial step, aland price survey was conducted within the ColomboDistrict in two rounds. The First round focused onthe land transactions that were taken place in 2003 asa benchmark to find determinants of land prices. Thesecond round of the survey was on transactions in2004 and 2005 to derive the trends in land prices.The findings of the survey were reported to both theMonetary Board and FSSC. The Department alsoconducted a business confidence survey (BCS) amongthe CEOs of companies listed in the Colombo StockExchange (CSE) through e-mail. This survey will beconducted frequently with further improvementsbased on the experience of the initial survey withexpanded coverage.

who function as field investigators. With theimprovements introduced to the system by initiatingdata collection from the centers in the Northern andEastern Provinces (NEP), the CWDCS collected datafrom 107 centres during 2006. With the introductionof new formats to update data collection, thesupervision of field investigators was also furtherstrengthned to ensure quality and timeliness ofinformation received according to an annual time tableset at the beginning of the year. Supervision of thecentres located in the NEP was carried out off site, asthe prevailing security situation did not permit fieldsupervision in those areas. As in the past, four regionalseminars were conducted in Colombo, Matara,Anuradhapura and Kandy to provide refresher trainingto the investigators in order to improve the accuracy,quality, efficiency and timeliness of their datacollection and also to educate them on contemporarydevelopments in the economy, so that such knowledgecan be transferred to school children and othermembers of the society. The effectiveness of suchprogrammes was reflected in the improved awarenessand the enthusiasm among the teacher investigators.Arrangements have been made to reduce the numberof data collection centers to 100 effective from January2007 under the programme initiated in 2005 torationalize the data collection under the CWDCS byrestructuring the data collection centers. Datacollection from the Pettah market was rationalized tobe more cost effective without compromising thequality and availability of data.

The seriesprovides comprehensive statistics for policy makersin analyzing and identifying regional disparities ineconomic activities and growth performances in thecountry.

Prices, Wages and Employment

The Department compiled and analysed six monthlyprice indices. While the five regional consumer priceindices measured the aggregate price movements inretail prices in five different regions, the WholesalePrice Index measured the same for producer orwholesale prices. The prices necessary for thecompilation of all indices were either collectedthrough the CWDCS or other forms of data collection.

In addition, the Department continued to analysemovements of consumer prices based on the ColomboConsumers’ Price Index (CCPI) and the Sri LankaConsumers’ Price Index (SLCPI) which are compiledby the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS).Projections for short term and medium term inflationprepared by the Department to be used as leadingindicators for the future direction of price movements.The Informal Sector Wage Rate Index (ISWRI) wasfurther improved by improving the quality of data. Acomposite CPI to represent the entire country withlatest weight structure based on the ConsumerFinances and Socio Economic Survey (CFS) 2003/04 conducted by the Department was compiled onexperimental basis. Compilation of Provincial CPIsin line with new composite CPI was also initiatedduring the latter part of 2006. A new software packagewith advanced features was developed with the helpof the IT Department to process CWDCS data.

The Department continued to conduct its Annual andQuarterly Public Sector Employment Survey.Information from both surveys was used in thecompilation of the National Income Accounts. Keyfindings from the quarterly survey were reported ona regular basis to the Monetary Board throughout theyear.

25. THE FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE UNIT(FIU)

Its establishment

By Gazette Order of 23rd March, 2006 made by H.E.The President, the FIU of Sri Lanka was establishedin the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in terms of theprovisions of the Financial Transactions Reporting ActNo.6 of 2006(FTRA), and has been operational sincethen. The FTRA constitutes one of the three piecesof legislation enacted to combat the financing ofterrorism and financial crime, the Convention on theSuppression of Terrorist Financing Act No.25 of2005(CSTFA) and the Prevention of MoneyLaundering Act No.5 of 2006(PMLA) representingthe other two. This legislation represents Sri Lanka’scommitment to collaborate with international effortson anti money laundering and combating the financingof terrorism(AML/CFT) and consolidates the CentralBank’s responsibility for financial system stability.

Its mandate

The mandate of the FIU in terms of the law is toreceive, analyse and disseminate information tocombat money laundering and terrorist financing,which is required to be undertaken both domesticallyand internationally. The need for an effectiveinformation sharing mechanism is crucial to thisobjective. Accordingly, financial institutionsdesignated by law, are mandated to generatesuspicious activity reports and other mandateddisclosures, such as cash transaction reports andforward them to the FIU. The centralization of thisfunction and designating the FIU as the receiver offinancial information, is fundamental for effectiveprevention, both in a national and internationalframework for AML/CFT.

Mandatory Reporting Requirements

By Gazette Order No.1437/25 dated 23rd March,2006, the first Regulations under the FTRA were madeby H.E. The President in his capacity as the Ministerof Finance. Accordingly, Financial TransactionsReporting Regulation No.1 was issued whereby thereporting threshold for the purposes of Section 6(a)

(LXI)

Part II

of the FTRA was determined to be, any transactionexceeding Rs.500,000 in cash or its equivalent inforeign currency and in terms of Section 6(b)electronic fund transfers (EFTs) in excess ofRs.500,000 or its equivalent in foreign currency.

Its scope

In discharging its mandate in terms of the law, theFIU has required, in the first instance, the licensedbanks and the registered finance companies, to reportall mandated cash transactions, EFTs meeting thestipulated threshold and any suspected transactionsrelating to money laundering and terrorist fundingactivities. The data received is analysed by the FIUand appropriate action is taken in terms of the law incollaboration, where necessary, with the lawenforcement agencies.

As the institutional and resource capabilities of the

FIU expand, the mandatory reporting requirementsof the FTRA will be extended, progressively, to otherfinancial institutions and designated non-financialinstitutions as defined in the FTRA. The coverage ofinstitutions in terms of the law is very wide, in linewith international best practice, and includes entitiesand persons in finance business, as well as entitiesand persons in designated non-finance business asdefined in the FTRA.

Notwithstanding these reporting requirements,however, all mandated financial institutions anddesignated non-financial institutions are required tocomply with the provisions of the FTRA.

The know-your-customer(KYC) and customer duediligence(CDD) guidelines and regulations requiredto be complied with by financial institutions in termsof the law, have already been drafted and will be issuedto the licensed banks and the registered financecompanies shortly.
