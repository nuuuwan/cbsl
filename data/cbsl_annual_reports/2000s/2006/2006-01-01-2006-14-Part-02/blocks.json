TheReport on the Impact Assessment Survey of the SFLCPconducted in 2005 was published during the year. Theresults of this survey indicate that around 63 percent of thebeneficiary households sampled (the sample consisted ofbeneficiary households which had been in the SFLCP for 5years or more) had crossed the poverty line within a periodof 5 years or more. The best results in this regard werereported in the districts of Puttalam and Matara where morethan 75 percent of beneficiary households in the samplehad escaped from poverty. Improvements in livingstandards in terms of quality of housing, access to amenitiesand ownership of consumer durables and capital items wereobserved in all four districts. The survey also revealed thatan appreciable number of beneficiary households creditneeds have moved beyond the upper threshold formicrocredit of Rs. 50,000 and, therefore, their presentrequirement was credit on commercial terms. A surveycovering major indicators of wealth, ownership of consumerdurables and capital goods, housing conditions,indebtedness and savings was undertaken in December 2006using a sample of 754 beneficiaries of the PovertyAlleviation Micro Finance Project (PAMP) which is anotherpilot poverty alleviation project operated by the CentralBank in the districts of Kurunegala, Kalutara, Nuwara Eliya,Badulla, Matale and Hambantota. Preliminary informationon this survey indicates that 55 percent of beneficiaryhouseholds in the sample had escaped poverty. This is asalutary development as 88 percent of households sampledhad joined the PAMP scheme after 2004. It has been decidedto conduct this survey annually on the same sample ofbeneficiaries to build up panel data which would permitthe analysis of chronic poverty and transitory poverty amongbeneficiaries. During the year under review, the outreachof the PAMP programme expanded by 12,968 households.A more comprehensive Impact Assessment Survey on thePAMP in line with the survey conducted on the SFLCP isalso expected to be conducted in 2007.",

Supervision of thecentres located in the NEP was carried out off site, asthe prevailing security situation did not permit fieldsupervision in those areas. As in the past, four regionalseminars were conducted in Colombo, Matara,Anuradhapura and Kandy to provide refresher trainingto the investigators in order to improve the accuracy,quality, efficiency and timeliness of their datacollection and also to educate them on contemporarydevelopments in the economy, so that such knowledgecan be transferred to school children and othermembers of the society. The effectiveness of suchprogrammes was reflected in the improved awarenessand the enthusiasm among the teacher investigators.Arrangements have been made to reduce the numberof data collection centers to 100 effective from January2007 under the programme initiated in 2005 torationalize the data collection under the CWDCS byrestructuring the data collection centers.
