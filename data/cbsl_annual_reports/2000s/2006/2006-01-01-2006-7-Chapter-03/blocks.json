Unlike fixed line telephones, the CDMAtechnology provides easy access to rural areas at a lowerfixed cost while also providing other value added services.However, further efforts are needed to provide digitalopportunities to under-served areas to provide economic andsocial benefits of ever improving Information andCommunications Technology (ICT) to the masses of SriLanka.

    "text": "High oil prices in the international market since 2003,has been posing a serious challenge to the macroeconomicmanagement in Sri Lanka. The high oil prices have arisen fromsupply concerns such as global geopolitical uncertainty, limitedspare capacity in oil production, disruptions in some oilexporting countries and the high demand particularly fromChina, India and the United States. This has increased SriLanka\u2019s import expenditure on petroleum products from USdollars 838 million in 2003 to US dollars 2,070 million in 2006.Sri Lanka imports approximately 30 - 32 million barrels ofpetroleum products per annum.The sharp rise and volatility in oil prices generate a seriesof macroeconomic imbalances. High import expenditure leadsto a draw-down of reserves and pressure on the exchange rate.It raises domestic fuel prices impacting on aggregate supply. Ifdomestic prices are not revised in line with international prices,there will be serious fiscal implications due to ensuing subsidypayments.Until June 2006, the government attempted to minimisethe burden of rising oil prices on consumers by subsidisingdomestic fuel prices. The government had to spend Rs. 17.5billion (about 0.9 per cent of GDP) in 2004 and Rs. 26 billion(about 1.1 per cent of GDP) in 2005 on oil subsidies.During thefirst six months of 2006, the oil subsidy to the Ceylon PetroleumCorporation (CPC) alone amounted to Rs. 9.4 billion. Althoughthe petroleum subsidy stabilised domestic petroleum prices to acertain extent in the short-term, the subsidy created seriousmacroeconomic implications through higher fiscal expenditure.Higher budget deficits emanating from huge oil subsidies in turnwould either raise the government borrowings, compel it toreduce capital expenditure or increase the tax burden. In view ofthese adverse implications, government discontinued theprovision of subsidies from July 2006.",

    "text": "reduced. Thus, the hedging is not aimed at generating profits,but mainly protecting from losses that could arise from adverseprice fluctuations. Some of the popular major hedging instruments, whichare used worldwide, could be applied in hedging oil purchasesare the following. Under Crude Oil Cap, a petroleum importersets the maximum price, which is called the Cap. If the marketprice rises above the Cap, the Hedging Organisation, usually aBank will pay the difference to the oil company. If the marketprice drops below the Cap, the importer is free to buy from theopen market. As consideration, the importer needs to pay apremium for each barrel. Under the Zero-Cost Collararrangement, the importer sets the maximum price, the HighCollar. In response, the bank sets the floor price, the Low Collar.If the market price is above the high collar price, the Bank willpay the difference between the high collar price and the marketprice to the the importer. If the market price is below the lowcollar price, the importer will pay the difference between thelow collar price and the market price to the Bank. In this caseno premium is involved. Under Swap, a fixed price will beagreed upon. If the market price is above the fixed price thebank will pay the difference to the the importer. If the marketprice is below the fixed price the the importer will have to paythe difference to the contracting party. This instrument requiresa premium (similar to insurance premium) to be paid by the theimporter. The cost of hedging could come either from direct costof hedging such as premium paid or indirect cost from lost profitdue to movement of market prices on the reverse direction (e.g.,significant drop in oil prices). These costs are the cost of avoidinguncertainty and ensuing stability.The CPC has commenced hedging part of its oil purchasesby entering into two hedging agreements to import diesel withStandard Chartered Bank in February 2007 using Zero CostCollar mechanism with a ceiling price. The objective of CPC\u2019shedging programme is to absorb price shocks and keep dieselprice at a stable level. CPC expects to gradually increase amountsof imports being hedged. The favourable impact of the hedgingarrangement on the country\u2019s balance of payments, officialreserves and domestic price level would contribute to the priceand economic stability of the country.",

Rajarata University of Sri Lanka established afaculty of Medical and Allied Sciences in 2006. TheSabaragamuwa University set up a Tourism Managementdepartment. Eastern University and University of Jaffna havealso introduced new study courses. However, the scope ofexpansion and upgrading of courses to required levels hasbeen constrained by limited availability of financial and otherresources, as universities are entirely dependent ongovernment funds for conducting undergraduate courses.However, studies show that private rate of return is greaterthan social rate of return from tertiary education, indicatingthat individuals are willing to share the cost of conductingsuch courses. Hence, fee-levying courses could be conductedfor those who can afford, while providing assistance to lowincome groups to enrol for the same courses to increase theintake, maintain the quality of education and to reduce thefiscal burden.",
