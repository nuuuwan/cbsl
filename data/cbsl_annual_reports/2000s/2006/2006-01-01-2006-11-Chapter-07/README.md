MONETARY POLICY, MONEY, CREDIT AND INTEREST RATES

7Chapter 7

The focus of monetary policyin 2006 was to contain highmonetary expansion, withoutinterupting the growthmomentum of the economy.Hence, monetary policy wascarefully tightened during the year,and the Central Bank’s policyinterest rates, viz; Repurchase andReverse Repurchase rates, wereraised in four steps in 2006. Theexcess liquidity in the bankingsystem was also absorbedthrough aggressive Open MarketOperations while discouragingbanks from using the reverserepurchase facility to borrow fundsfrom the Central Bank.

MONETARY POLICY, MONEY, CREDIT AND INTEREST RATES

Simultaneously, other measures such as imposing marginrequirements on Letters of Credit opened for imports of someidentified goods and restricting credit facilities to meet suchrequirements as well as moral suasion to discourage banksfrom excessive credit creation were also implemented duringthe year. These efforts were complemented by the prudentialrequirements imposed on banks.

Meeting monetary targets was a challenge in 2006 ascredit demand by public sector as well as the privatesector remained high. Market interest rates rose in line withpolicy rate changes thereby discouraging further expansionin demand for credit. Accordingly, both the reserve moneyand broad money growth decelerated by August 2006.However, with the increased borrowings by the public sectorduring the last few months of the year, the growth in monetaryaggregates began to accelerate resulting in a deviation fromthe targeted path. However, the deviation could have beeneven higher if tight monetary policy measures had not beentaken.

Inflation which decelerated until March 2006,commenced rising thereafter. This was mainly a result ofhigher monetary expansion, as indicated by the rise in coreinflation. The increase in administrative prices includingdomestic oil price adjustments due to the elimination of thepetroleum subsidy also resulted in a one-off increase ininflation. The removal in subsidies is expected to have afavourable impact on future inflation through lower budgetdeficits.

In January 2007, the Central Bank announced the plannedmonetary policy path for 2007 in its policy announcement“ Road Map for Monetary and Financial Sector Policiesfor 2007 and beyond”, and took several measures toachieve price and economic stability. In that exercise, theexessive growth in monetary aggregates in 2006 was takeninto consideration in setting the monetary targets for 2007.Those targets and the Central Bank’s strategies wereannounced to the public in order to enhance the transparencyof the monetary policy implementation process and todemonstrate the Central Bank’s commitment to achieve theannounced monetary targets. A monitoring mechanism of keymacroeconomic variables of fiscal, monetary and externalsectors was established to identify any possible deviation fromthe targets in advance so that nesessary action could be takenearly to ensure that the targets are achieved. A MonetaryPolicy Consultative Committee (MPCC) was set up,comprising of representatives from other stakeholders inorder to obtain their views on monetary policy implementation.In consultation with the Central Bank, the National EconomicCouncil (NEC) chaired by H.E. the President directed severalother institutions to take the necessary measures to reduceinflation to a desirable level during the year. The successfulimplementation of such measures are expected to reduceinflation, while maintaining economic growth at a desirablelevel.

7.2Monetary Policy

The monetary policy of the Central Bank in 2006 wasfocussed on reducing high inflation and inflationaryexpectations while supporting a sustainable higheconomic growth. The Bank continued its monetary policyoperations within the monetary targeting policy frameworkunder an independently floating exchange rate system. Inthe monetary targeting framework, growth in reserve money(high powered money) is used as the operational target whilethe growth in broad money (M2b) is used as the intermediatetarget. Active open market operations were used as the mainmonetary policy instrument which was operated through aninterest rate corridor formed by the Repurchase and ReverseRepurchase rates of the Central Bank. The Statutory ReserveRequirement (SRR) was maintained at 10 per cent, whilethe Bank rate remained at 15 per cent.

The tight monetary policy stance adopted from end 2004was continued during 2006 in view of rising inflationarypressures. Accordingly, the Central Bank raised its policyinterest rates by 125 basis points in four steps during 2006,which was in addition to the increase of 175 basis pointsduring 2004 and 2005. The Central Bank has also beenconducting Open Market Operations (OMO) aggressively, tomanage the liquidity in the market consistently with thetargeted reserve money path. The increased rupee liquiditydue to purchases of foreign currency inflows to thegovernment by the Central Bank was needed to be absorbedon a permanent basis through outright sales of Treasurybills by the Central Bank. Also, the 100 per cent marginrequirement on Letters of Credit (LC) for the importation ofseveral categories of vehicles, which was introduced in 2004,was further strengthened by instructing banks not to grantcredit to meet this requirement. At the same time, banks wereinstructed not to open LCs for the importation of severalluxury items unless such LCs were covered by a minimumcash margin of 50 per cent of imported value deposited withbanks. A similar margin requirement was imposed againstimportation of non-essential items on Documents onAcceptance (DA) terms. In addition to these measures, moralsuasion was used to discourage the usage of reverserepurchase facility and lending to unproductive sectors bycommercial banks.

In addition to the monetary policy measures, severalprudential measures were also introduced in 2006 tocontain high credit expansion. A general provisioningrequirement of 1 per cent was imposed on all performingadvances of commercial banks with effect from the fourthquarter of 2006 and such provision is required to be metwithin ten quarters. Further, risk weights in respect of loanssecured by primary mortgages over residential propertieswere increased from 50 per cent to 55 per cent, and riskweights in respect of loans categorised as other loans andadvances were increased from 100 per cent to 110 per cent,in the computation of capital adequacy. These measures wereexpected to slow down the private sector credit expansionas well.

Responding to the tight monetary policy measuresmarket interest rates increased more than the policy rateincreases, thereby making credit more expensive. Withthe increase in Central Bank’s Repurchase and ReverseRepurchase rates by 125 basis points each and aggressiveconduct of OMOs, the weighted average OMO auction rateincreased by 177 basis points in 2006. Call money rates alsoincreased by 374 basis points, while the Average WeightedDeposit Rate (AWDR) and the Average Weighted PrimeLending Rate (AWPR) increased by 136 and 295 basis points,respectively. With these developments, the monetaryaggregates decelerated to a certain extent by the third quarterof the year. However, the decelerating trend reversed towardsthe end of 2006 with the surge in borrowings by thegovernment due to increased recurrent expenditure andincrease in borrowings by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation(CPC). Accordingly, these increased borrowings became oneof the main challenges in the endeavour to achieve themonetary targets. However, the current higher interest rates,supported by complementary fiscal measures are expectedto induce a significant deceleration in the monetary expansionduring 2007.

Demand side factors, exacerbated by supply shortagesalso had an impact on inflation. As measured by the point-to-point change in Colombo Consumers’ Price Index (CCPI),inflation declined to 6.4 per cent in March 2006 from 8 percent at end 2005, but increased sharply to 19.3 per cent byend 2006. Meanwhile, the average inflation increased from11.6 per cent at end 2005 to 13.7 per cent at end 2006. Thepoint-to-point inflation, measured using the Sri LankaConsumers’ Price Index (SLCPI), increased from 3.6 per centas at end 2005 to 17.9 per cent as at end 2006. Although,changes in the administrative prices contributed to one-offincrease in the cost of living, it was desirable for combatingthe long-term inflation. This is because such price adjustmentsobviate the necessity for subsidising such products throughmoney supply increases.

The Central Bank took several measures to improvemonetary transmission and the monetary policydecision-making process to enhance its effectivenesson achieving price stability. As a measure of improvingeffectiveness of monetary policy further, a comprehensivemonitoring mechanism has been introduced at the beginningof 2007 on key variables, which affect the realising ofmonetary policy targets. Contemporaneous developments ofthese variables in external, fiscal and monetary sectors aredue to be monitored and compared with targets to take timelycorrective measures.

The communication policy of the Central Bank wasintensively used to enhance public awareness ofdevelopments in the economy, policy measures takenand their expected impact on future developments. TheCentral Bank published the monetary policy targets withexplanatory notes at the beginning of the year, while the

monetary policy stance of the Central Bank was reviewed ona monthly basis and the public was kept informed of thedecisions according to an advance release calendar. Inaddition, the Central Bank continued to make availableinformation on key macroeconomic developments, to enablemarket participants as well as the general public to arrive atinformed decisions. Also, the Bank announced the “RoadMap: Monetary and Financial Sector Policies for 2007 andbeyond” at the beginning of 2007 enhancing the transparencyand accountability of the Central Bank.

7.3Developments in Money and CreditAggregates

Money Market Liquidity

The Central Bank attempted to maintain market liquiditybroadly in balance throughout the year. OMOs wereconducted aggressively to absorb excess liquidity, both onan overnight basis and permanently. Lending to commercialbanks through the reverse repurchase facility was alsomonitored carefully in view of its expansionary impact onmonetary aggregates.

Reserve Money

Reserve money, the operational target of the monetarypolicy, remained above the desired path during most ofthe year but its expansion was contained through thetight monetary policy stance. The tight monetary policymeasures helped to contain the excessive growth of reservemoney, which decelerated to 16 per cent by the third quarterof the year. However, by the end of 2006, the high growth re-emerged to around 21 per cent, mainly due to increasedborrowings of the government through the banking system.

The increase in reserve money during the year isreflected in the increase in both Net Foreign Assets (NFA)and Net Domestic Assets (NDA) of the Central Bank. NFAincreased by around Rs.22 billion (net of rupee valuationchanges) mainly due to the purchases of foreign currencyproceeds received by the government by way of foreignproject and programme loans, foreign currency loans raisedfrom the Offshore Banking Units (OBU) of licensedcommercial banks and net issues of Sri Lanka DevelopmentBonds (SLDBs). NDA increased by around Rs.20 billionreflecting the increase in provisional advances given to thegovernment by Rs. 9 billion and the increase in Treasury billholdings of the Central Bank by around Rs. 30 billion, theimpact of which was partly offset by the increased liabilitiesof the Central Bank.

The reserve money expansion was reflected in theincrease in currency in circulation and commercial bankdeposits with the Central Bank. Currency in circulationincreased by Rs. 25 billion in 2006, reflecting the increaseddemand for currency while the deposits of commercial bankswith the Central Bank increased by Rs. 17 billion in line withthe increased rupee deposit liabilities of commercial banks.

MONETARY POLICY, MONEY, CREDIT AND INTEREST RATES

The concept of core inflation, introduced in 1975by Robert J. Gordon, is based on the idea of identifyingthe persistent non-reversible trend of price movementsby separating short-run fluctuations from the ‘headlineinflation’, the inflation measured by using availableprice indices. The headline inflation is often subject tolarge and temporary fluctuations, arising from supplyside shocks, for example, declines in production dueto unfavourable weather conditions or changes in taxesor administered prices. Since the impact of supplyshocks is temporary, it is inappropriate to base demandmanagement policies, such as monetary policy, on suchchanges without making suitable adjustments.Monetary authorities need to be concerned withchanges in prices resulting from changes in theaggregate demand. Hence, a measure of inflationrepresenting changes due to the aggregate demand isdeemed to be more appropriate for conductingmonetary policy. Consequently, a growing number ofcountries are adopting the concept of core inflation inmaking monetary policy decisions.

Core inflation, or underlying inflation, ismeasured in several ways. The most common approachis the ‘exclusion method’, which derives the coreinflation behaviourally by recompiling price indicesafter removing a fixed number of items from theoriginal index in each period consistently. The itemsusually excluded are the items with highly volatileprices and items that have administered prices, usuallyenergy and food items. In the United States and Canada,for example, both food and energy prices are excluded,as they tend to be highly volatile. In the UnitedKingdom, mortgage interest costs are excluded fromthe index to compute the core inflation as they aredirectly influenced by changes in the policy interestrates. The exclusion method is used by central banksmore frequently than other methods as that method iscomputationally simple, easy to understand andderivable without any time lag.

The volatile components are also removed fromthe indices through statistical approaches. For example,the ‘Trimmed Mean’ measure removes both very high

and very low deviations from the index. This methodtoo is based on recompiling the index after removingcertain items, but differs from the behavioural approach,as the items so excluded are not consistent over time.In trimmed mean method, items with highest volatilityin each month are excluded instead, based on theirstandard deviations. Another statistical method isreweighing the items in the index using the inverse ofstandard deviation. Despite the qualitative superiorityof the statistical approach, central banks use them lesscommonly than the exclusion method, primarilybecause the statistical approaches are not easy to explainto the public and difficult to replicate. Some researcheshave recognised the centred median as a good measureof core inflation, but this method is of less operationaluse as its deriving involves a time lag. However, severalcentral banks use weighted median as a practicalalternative to the centred median.

There are econometric approaches too forestimating core inflation such as the Structural VectorAuto Regression (SVAR) model estimate. The majorweakness of econometric modeling is past observationsbeing changed when a new observation is added.Therefore, this measure is not a suitable candidate asthe official core inflation measure, which in turn has tobe announced to the general public. Though used bycentral banks less prominently, some researchers havealso considered economic approaches, by trying toderive a measure of core inflation using the long-runneutrality assumption of monetary theory.

Many countries use core inflation in the conductof monetary policy, as core inflation is an indicator thatcould be targeted by monetary policy with a greatereffectiveness. The most common approach to measurecore inflation is the exclusion method. As shown inTable B 9.1, food, energy and mortgage interestpayments are some of the items excluded by variouscountries. Unlike developed countries, the share of fooditems in a CPI of a developing country is significantlylarge. This has motivated many developing countriesto exclude selected more volatile food items, insteadof all food items, when deriving the core inflation.

Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) is theofficial cost of living index of the country, as well as themeasure of inflation widely used by firms and individualsin planning current and future consumption and investment,thereby affecting inflation expectations, despite theweaknesses as a representative index. Thus, CCPI is theheadline inflation measure most appropriate for derivingan official measure of core inflation for Sri Lanka until aproper index is introduced, and the exclusion methodappears to be the most appropriate method.

It is important to note that a core inflationmeasure can represent the actual trend of underlyinginflation only to the extent that the relevant headlineinflation measure is representative of real householdconsumption patterns. Core inflation, therefore, does nothelp to overcome the deficiencies of headline inflationmeasure arising from misrepresentation andmisweighting, which needs to be corrected by revisingthe CCPI basket and the weights. Hence, a core inflationmeasure based on the proposed new index would be themost appropriate index to measure the demand driveninflation.

Narrow Money (M1)

Narrow money (M1), which consists of currency anddemand deposits held by public, indicated a declininggrowth trend during the year. Growth in narrow moneydeclined from around 22 per cent at end 2005 to around 12.6per cent by end 2006. This decline could be attributed to thelower growth in demand deposits resulting from the generalpublic moving from demand deposits to interest bearingdeposits in view of rising interest rates, a likely outcome ofthe tight monetary policy stance adopted by the Central Bank.

Broad Money (M2b)

Although the Monetary policy measures were successfulin decelerating monetary expansion, the expansion wasyet above the desired target. The growth in broad moneydeclined from 19.1 per cent at end 2005 to 17.8 per cent atend 2006, compared to the targeted growth of 15 per cent.The increases in currency held by the public, as well as allthe deposits held by the public contributed to the expansionin broad money. Reflecting the increased transaction demandfor money, currency held by the public increased by 18.3 percent while deposits increased by 17.8 per cent. However,

demand deposits grew at a relatively lower rate of 7 percent,while the time and savings deposits increased by 19.4 percent. The continued efforts by banks to attract more depositsthrough various deposit promotion schemes largelycontributed to the growth in time and savings deposits.However, the deposit mobilisation by state banks was notsufficient, compared to their credit growth thereby raising thecredit to deposit ratio. Foreign currency deposits alsoincreased by 8.3 per cent, which could be attributed to theattractive interest rates offered by banks on such depositsfollowing the increase in interest rates in major internationalmarkets.

The expansion of domestic assets of the banking systemwas the main contributor to the rapid expansion in broadmoney. The increase in broad money was entirely causedby the increase in NDA of the banking system, as the NFA ofthe banking system declined during the year despite theincrease in NFA of the Central Bank. The NFA of the CentralBank increased mainly due to the purchases of foreigncurrency proceeds received by the government and foreigncurrency loans raised by the government from the OBUs oflicensed commercial banks. However, the NFA of commercialbanks declined following foreign currency loans provided tothe government, investments in SLDBs raised by thegovernment and utilisation of foreign currency deposits aswell as foreign currency borrowings by the CPC fromcommercial banks to settle its oil bills.

The expansion in NDA of the banking system was due tothe higher increase in domestic credit to the private andpublic sectors (which includes government and publiccorporations). In view of the continued expansion in

economic activities, innovative credit schemes offered bybanks at competitive rates and relatively low real interestrates, credit to the private sector increased at a higher rateduring 2006. The credit growth remained in the range of 22 –25 per cent. About 92 per cent of the credit growth was fromdomestic banking units of commercial banks and the balancewas from OBUs. The purpose-wise classification of creditindicates that a major share of credit has been towards trading(29 per cent), consumption related activities (19 per cent)and real estate development and housing (16 per cent).

The utilisation of credit from the banking sector by thegovernment increased due to higher than expectedgovernment recurrent expenditure and less utilisationof the resources available in the non-bank sector during2006. Net Credit to the Government (NCG) from the bankingsystem during the year increased by Rs.88 billion againstthe Rs.6 billion expected in the monetary programme andthe increase of Rs 26 billion in 2005. NCG from the CentralBank on account of increased holdings of Treasury bills andprovisional advances increased by Rs. 38 billion while thebalance Rs.50 billion came from commercial banks. NCGfrom commercial banks increased due to foreign currencyborrowings by the government from OBUs, net issues ofSLDBs to commercial banks, increased overdraft facilitiesand increased holdings of government securities.

Increased borrowings by some public corporations alsocontributed to the excessive monetary expansion in 2006.Credit to public corporations increased significantly,particularly towards the latter part of the year with CPC raisingits borrowings from commercial banks. The overall increaseduring 2006 was at Rs. 15 billion while credit granted to CPC

The growth in broad money as measured by the financialsurvey (M4) increased in a range of 15-19 per cent during2006. Although the broad money based on financial surveyincreased at a high rate, it is lower than the recorded growthrate in the consolidated broad money (M2b)1 . The expansionin money supply as measured in the financial survey wasentirely due to the increase in NDA of the banking systemand registered finance companies.

facility also had an impact on market interest rates to increase.Following the upward revisions in policy interest rates of majoreconomies, international market interest rates also increased,leading to increases in interest rates applicable to foreigncurrency denominated deposits and lending during the year.

Money Market Rates

Money market interest rates were volatile during 2006,reflecting the volatility in overall market liquidity, but thetrend broadly followed the policy rate revisions of theCentral Bank. The daily OMO auctions were not held onmost days during the second half of 2006, as the liquidity inthe market was broadly in balance and to discourage theregular use of Reverse Repo facility by the commercial banks.The weighted average yield rate at the daily OMO auctionsincreased from 9.29 per cent at end 2005 to 11.06 per centat end 2006. The weighted average OMO rate was mostlywithin the policy interest rate corridor during the year.

An upward trend amidst some volatility was seen in othershort-term interest rates as well reflecting higher inflation

expectations especially during the second half of 2006.The weighted average call money rate was quite volatile in arange of 9.89-16.01 per cent during 2006. It reached 14.47per cent at the end of 2006, which is higher by 374 basispoints compared to 10.73 per cent at end 2005. Despite theimpact on call market rates from increased policy rates, themain reason for the large upward movement was due to thediscouragement of the provision of liquidity through ReverseRepurchase facility. The tax adjusted weighted average callmoney rate moved above the upper bound of the interestrate corridor towards the end of 2006, reflecting the deficit inmarket liquidity. It remained around 13.00 per cent by endDecember 2006. Similarly, the Sri Lanka Inter Bank OfferedRate (SLIBOR)2 also has been volatile in 2006. The rise inmarket interest rates however is expected to containexcessive growth in private sector credit in 2007.

Consolidation in the bankingsector may help reduce the intermediation cost byimproving returns to scale in the banking industry.Further, improvements to operational efficiency of statebanks and diversification of banking operations beyondthe core business would help reduce dependence on netinterest income and assist reducing the interest spread.

Deposit and Lending Rates

Both deposit and lending rates of commercial banks aswell as other long term lending institutions increased in2006. Interest spread measured by the difference betweenaverage interest income and average interest expenditurenarrowed during the first half of 2006, with relatively largerupward adjustments in deposit rates by the banks with a viewof increasing their deposit base. However, it widened duringthe second half of 2006, since the lending rates increasednotably along with upward adjustments in the market interest

rates without much upward adjustments in the deposit rates.

The Average Weighted Prime Lending Rate (AWPR)3

declined in first half of 2006, but increased thereafterfollowing the other market interest rates. The declineduring the first half of 2006 was a reflection of increasedmarket liquidity. However, during the second half of the yearthough it had some volatility, generally there was an upwardtrend. Accordingly, AWPR increased by 295 basis points from12.24 per cent at end 2005 to 15.19 per cent by end of 2006.The Average Weighted Lending Rate (AWLR), which is thelending rate applicable to the entire loan portfolio of domesticbanking units of commercial banks, increased graduallyduring 2006.

The Legal Rate and the Market Rate increased with theincrease in deposits rates of the commercial banks. TheLegal Rate and the Market Rate4 applicable for a particularcalendar year are computed on the same basis using theAverage Weighted Deposit Rate (AWDR)5 of all thecommercial banks and are published in the GovernmentGazette at the end of the preceding year. Hence, both theLegal Rate and Market Rate are identical. The rate applicablefor the year 2007 is 6.86 per cent compared with 5.70 percent for 2006.

Interest rate applicable to foreign currency deposits andlending also increased in 2006 with the increase ininternational interest rates following tightening of monetarypolicy in major economies.

Yields on Government Securities

Yields on government securities increased at a slowerrate during the first nine months of 2006 and increasedat a relatively higher rate thereafter in line with theincreases in policy interest rates and inflationexpectations. Market preference was seen for short-termand medium-term maturities, which could be due touncertainities about future interest rate changes.

The increase in yields on Treasury bonds was lower thanthe increase in yields on Treasury bills, since the numberof market based issues of Treasury bonds were lower in2006 as the government relied more on privateplacements and bank borrowings. Yields on Treasury billsincreased in a range of 246-266 basis points during the year,while yields on Treasury bonds with 3-5 year maturitiesincreased in a range of 94-126 basis points. The issue ofTreasury bonds was made mainly through privateplacements.

The secondary market yield curve on governmentsecurities moved upward particularly towards the endof 2006. The yield curve was less steep, as evidenced bythe yield spread between 1-year Treasury bills and 4-yearTreasury bonds which was only 72 basis points compared to97 basis points in 2005, possibly reflecting marketuncertainties of future inflation and interest rate movements.The spread between the primary market yields and secondarymarket yields narrowed down, with the upward movement ofyields in the primary market by the end of the year.

7.5Further Developments and MonetaryPolicy Issues

Having a more representative index to reliably measuremovements in the aggregate price level is imperative foreffective monetary policy decision making. It needs to

reflect the current consumption pattern of an averageconsumer and should cover broader geographical spread.Considering this vital requirement, measures have alreadybeen taken to compile a new price index by the Departmentof Census and Statistics in 2007.

As inflation expectations of market participants has astrong relationship with inflation, the Central Bankrecognises this need to take measures to deal withinflation expectations in its monetary policy formulation.As this necessitates measuring inflation expectations, theCentral Bank has already conducted an inflation expectationsurvey with a wider coverage of market participants andfurther improvements expected to be made to enhance itseffectiveness.

The achievement of monetary targets largely dependson the fiscal consolidation, and therefore reliance offiscal sector on banking resources has to be in line withthe expectations in the government budget. Any increasein borrowings from the banking sector would exert inflationarypressures while limiting the availability of resources forinvestment in the private sector, which in turn will affect growthobjectives of the economy.
