Gordon, is based on the idea of identifyingthe persistent non-reversible trend of price movementsby separating short-run fluctuations from the \u2018headlineinflation\u2019, the inflation measured by using availableprice indices. The headline inflation is often subject tolarge and temporary fluctuations, arising from supplyside shocks, for example, declines in production dueto unfavourable weather conditions or changes in taxesor administered prices. Since the impact of supplyshocks is temporary, it is inappropriate to base demandmanagement policies, such as monetary policy, on suchchanges without making suitable adjustments.Monetary authorities need to be concerned withchanges in prices resulting from changes in theaggregate demand. Hence, a measure of inflationrepresenting changes due to the aggregate demand isdeemed to be more appropriate for conductingmonetary policy. Consequently, a growing number ofcountries are adopting the concept of core inflation inmaking monetary policy decisions.",

The itemsusually excluded are the items with highly volatileprices and items that have administered prices, usuallyenergy and food items. In the United States and Canada,for example, both food and energy prices are excluded,as they tend to be highly volatile. In the UnitedKingdom, mortgage interest costs are excluded fromthe index to compute the core inflation as they aredirectly influenced by changes in the policy interestrates.

This methodtoo is based on recompiling the index after removingcertain items, but differs from the behavioural approach,as the items so excluded are not consistent over time.In trimmed mean method, items with highest volatilityin each month are excluded instead, based on theirstandard deviations. Another statistical method isreweighing the items in the index using the inverse ofstandard deviation. Despite the qualitative superiorityof the statistical approach, central banks use them lesscommonly than the exclusion method, primarilybecause the statistical approaches are not easy to explainto the public and difficult to replicate. Some researcheshave recognised the centred median as a good measureof core inflation, but this method is of less operationaluse as its deriving involves a time lag.
