Therefore, both diversified shareownership and concentration in share ownership in banksare alternative means adopted by the regulators topromote banking and financial system stability. Principle4 of the Basel Core Principles for Effective BankingSupervision (principles recommended by the BaselCommittee of the Bank for International Settlementsbased in Basel as international best practice for guidanceof the bank regulators) requires that bank regulators havethe authority to review and reject any proposal to transfersignificant ownership of controlling interest in banks. Inline with this principle, many regulatory authoritiesworldwide determine the maximum limits of shareownership in a bank while specifying conditions andrequirements for granting permission for acquisition ofshares in excess of the maximum limits to ensure thatthe shareholders who acquire such large or controllinginterest in banks are fit and proper persons and risks oncorporate governance arising from such largeshareholding are adequately mitigated.

For example, under the current legal provision,ten shareholders can own a commercial bank (by eachholding 10 per cent legally permitted), appoint the Boardof Directors and influence the management. It will be clearthat this situation, even though legal, can be actuallyconsidered as a concentrated ownership of the Bank byjust a few shareholders. Further, such shareholders maypurchase shares of other banks within permissible limitsand consolidate their position in the banking sector.Therefore, what is essentially and critically required toprevent possible management issues connected with shareownership is the speedy implementation of moderncorporate governance principles effectively. It is true thatshareholders have interests in the affairs of their bank. Atthe same time and even more importantly, depositors andcreditors too have interests in banks, and the stability ofbanks depend on their confidence in banks. Moderncorporate governance principles require that institutionsmanage their affairs in a transparent and accountablemanner to safeguard of interests of all stakeholders suchas shareholders, customers, employees and the generalpublic.",

Itis necessary to regulate Micro Finance Institutions(MFIs) as the funds held by them are those of the poorand vulnerable, and if such persons lose their savings,they will inevitably sink further into poverty. Further,the poor will lose confidence in the financial system insuch circumstances, which would impede their savingsactivities. Also, if the micro-credit sector is sufficientlylarge, failure of several MFIs could pose a threat tofinancial system stability.

Financialconglomerates have evolved with the diversification oftraditional specialised activities. Technologicalinnovation, liberalisation of financial markets andremoval of legal and trade barriers have encouraged thedevelopment of diversified financial conglomerates withcomplex management and corporate structures. Inaddition, many conglomerates are organised along globalbusiness lines and manage some or all of their majorrisks across the various entities within the group, in amanner that cuts across legal entity lines.

However, assets of suchunregulated entities constitute only 7 per cent of totalassets of all conglomerates, indicating operations at alow key.
