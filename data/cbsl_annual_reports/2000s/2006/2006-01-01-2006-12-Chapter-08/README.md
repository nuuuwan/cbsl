FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS AND STABILITY

The Central Bank continued to strengthen thesupervisory and regulatory framework of banks andnon-bank financial institutions by introducingnecessary legislation and amending legislation toenable reforms. The Central Bank intensified the regulationand supervision of specialised leasing companies in 2006.In view of the rapid growth in credit, several prudentialmeasures were introduced during the year. The preparationfor the implementation of Basel II Capital AdequacyFramework was facilitated by issuing guidelines to banksfor the parallel computation of the capital charge. To promotethe integrity of, and confidence in the financial system andrecognising the risks posed by money laundering andterrorist financing, Sri Lanka introduced comprehensive lawsto combat these emerging threats. Amendments were alsomade to the Monetary Law Act and Banking Act.

The Central Bank took further measures in 2006 toimprove the efficiency and regulatory framework of thepayment and settlement systems. The Cheque Imagingand Truncation (CIT) System was introduced in 2006 toexpedite the clearing of retail and low value payments on acountry-wide basis. To ensure that participants of theLankaSettle and LankaClear systems have effectiveBusiness Continuity Plans (BCPs), the Central Bank issuedguidelines to financial institutions outlining the BCP minimumstandards. A National Payments Council was established,comprising of representatives of all major stakeholders to

facilitate the formulation of a national payments policy forthe country and to take forward the modernisation of thepayments and settlements infrastructure. The payments andsettlements system was further strengthened by theintroduction of a law to deter illegal and hazardous practicesrelating to payment devices.

Financial system stability strengthened further in 2006following the continued enhancement of regulatory andsupervisory measures over the key financial institutionsand major payment and settlements systems, andimproved risk management. Although the improvement inthe financial system stability is reflected in several keyfinancial performance indicators, the potential sources ofvulnerability, which may affect the financial system, are thebuild-up of inflationary pressures, high credit growth leadingto an impairment of credit quality, rising debt service burdenand the widening current account deficit due to high oil prices.Nevertheless, the gradual tightening of monetary policy tocontain inflationary pressures, additional prudentialmeasures taken to deter high credit growth, government’seffort for fiscal consolidation and improvements to prudentialregulations as enunciated in the “Road Map : Monetary andFinancial Sector Policies for 2007 and beyond” would helpmitigate and contain the adverse effects of these risks.

8.2Developments in FinancialInstitutions

Activities of financial institutions further expandedduring 2006. The total assets of the financial institutionsincreased by 18 per cent, reaching Rs. 3,706 billion whichis 1.3 times the GDP. Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs)and Licensed Specialised Banks (LSBs), which accountedfor 57.4 per cent of the total assets of the financial system,continued to hold a dominant position in the financial sector.LCBs contributed to 58.6 per cent of the asset growth of thefinancial system.

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Total assets of the Central Bank increased by 12.4 percent in 2006 with the increase in both net foreign assets(NFA) and net domestic assets (NDA). The increase inNFA was largely due to the purchases of foreign currencyproceeds received by the government.

NDA of the Central Bank increased with the increasedTreasury bill holdings and provisional advances to thegovernment. The Central Bank sterilised a considerableamount of rupee liquidity that arose due to the foreigncurrency purchases, through outright sales of the Bank’sTreasury bill holdings to reduce its expansionary impact onthe money supply. However, the Bank’s Treasury billholdings at end 2006 were higher by Rs.30 billion comparedto the end 2005 level, thereby leading to the increase inNDA.

On the liability side, the total currency issue of theCentral Bank increased by 18.7 per cent (Rs.24.8 billion),reflecting increased transaction demand for currency.Along with the growth in deposit liabilities of commercialbanks, the deposits of commercial banks held with theCentral Bank for statutory reserve purposes increased by26 per cent (Rs. 17 billion).

Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs)

The performance of LCBs improved further in 2006 interms of growth of assets, expansion in deliverychannels, improvement in risk management, riskabsorption capacity and use of information technology.The LCBs, numbering 23, operated through a network of1,530 branches, and 1,986 other service outlets. Supportingthis network there were 1,127 automated teller machines(ATMs) and 8,753 electronic fund transfer facilities at thepoint of sale (EFTPOS) machines, which contributed towardsgreater accessibility of banking services. The total numberof credit cards in use increased from 637,326 in 2005 to811,289 in 2006. There were 16 banks providing fully fledgedinternet banking facilities with many banks utilising thedevelopments in information and communicationtechnologies to offer innovative banking services. The useof innovative service delivery mechanisms such as postalnetwork and mobile phones to deliver financial and paymentrelated services were witnessed during the year.

The regulatory framework covering the LCBs wasstrengthened and improved to promote riskmanagement, greater market discipline and to mitigatepotential sources of risks. Several prudential measuresand guidelines were issued covering market risk,provisioning requirements, and capital adequacy within theBasel II framework to enhance the resilience of the bankingsector. LCBs also took several initiatives in this regard,especially in the areas of credit and operational risks throughthe launch of special loan recovery drives, infusion of newcapital, establishment of Disaster Recovery Sites (DRS),formulation of Business Continuity Plans (BCPs) andimprovement in technical capacities of staff in the use ofadvanced risk management techniques.

Developments in the Structure of LCBs: The total assetsof LCBs increased further, supported by higher expansionof credit with the continued expansion of economic activitiesand attractive lending rates in real terms. Within the bankingsector, the domestic private LCBs recorded a 22.2 per centgrowth of assets, while the state owned LCBs recorded anasset growth of 15.3 per cent. The contribution of domesticprivate LCBs and state owned LCBs to the total growth inassets was 45.3 per cent and 30.6 per cent, respectively.Meanwhile, assets of foreign LCBs grew at a rate of 24.2per cent. In terms of contributions of various sources to thegrowth in assets, loans and advances accounted for about70 per cent in 2006 compared to 50 per cent in 2005.

The overall growth in loans and advances was mainlyfuelled by expansion of credit by state banks and thedomestic private LCBs. Of the 31 per cent growth in loansand advances, 49 per cent and 43 per cent were contributedby the state owned LCBs and domestic private LCBs,respectively. State owned LCBs recorded the highest growthin loans and advances of 44 per cent followed by foreignLCBs with a growth of 25 per cent.

Increased interest margins, improved cost efficiencyand a rise in foreign exchange income contributed to ahealthy growth in profits in the LCB sector. Profits beforetax grew by 34 per cent to Rs. 30 billion with the net interestincome increasing by 17 per cent in 2006 relative to 2 percent increase in 2005. Domestic private LCBs contributedto 58 per cent of the growth in profit of the sector. Theprofitability in terms of return on assets (ROA) and return onequity (ROE) improved over the previous year and stood at1.8 per cent and 18.5 per cent, respectively, at end 2006.

in borrowings and a decline in deposits. While thecontribution of borrowings increased to 12.2 per cent from7.8 per cent in 2005, the contribution of deposits declinedfrom 74.4 per cent in 2005 to 70.2 per cent. Total depositsgrowth in 2006 was 15.6 per cent, which is a reflection ofthe higher disposable income of households following thecontinued expansion in economic activities and liquidity inthe system.

The share of capital funds in the total resource base ofLCBs improved marginally in 2006 in comparison to2005. Consequently, the share of borrowings and capitalfunds in the total resources also increased to 20.0 per centfrom 15.5 per cent in 2005. However, of the three mainfunding sources, borrowings recorded a significant growth.

Reflecting the high credit expansion, an increased levelof resource utilisation in respect of loans and advanceswas witnessed during the year. Of the total resourcesmobilised through deposits, capital, borrowings and othersources, Rs. 229.3 billion was absorbed by increase in loansand advances, representing over 70 per cent of the totalresources mobilised during the year. The share of loans inthe total funding base increased to 57.8 per cent at end2006 relative to 34.9 per cent at end 2005, while the shareof investments dropped to 12 per cent from 16 per cent duringthe same period.

Purpose-wise distribution of credit continued to bedominated by trading, housing and consumptionactivities. The share of credit for trading activities includingdomestic and international trade declined during the yearand reached 29.1 per cent by end 2006, despite the 12.5per cent growth in credit for such purposes. Meanwhile, theshare of credit absorbed by housing and construction andconsumption activities increased to 16.2 per cent and 19.4per cent and grew by 41 per cent each by end 2006. In theconsumption category, loans granted for purchase ofconsumer goods accounted for the bulk of the increase, whilein the credit for housing activities, the residential housingsector contributed to the largest share.

An increase in credit card business was recorded inthe backdrop of the increased disposable income andattractive incentive packages offered by banks. Creditprovided through credit cards by ten banks increased by 41per cent to Rs 21.1 billion, amidst fierce competition amongcredit card services offering banks. However, the share ofcredit card loans in the total loan portfolio of LCBs was about1.7 per cent. Due to the unsecured nature of such lending,interest rates on credit card loans ranged between 21 -42per cent. Although there appears to be a rapid increase incredit card business, the level of penetration of credit cardsamong the population is still relatively low compared to many

cent mainly due to the contraction in interest margin and areduction in capital gains. Total deposits and borrowingsincreased by 8.4 per cent and 35 per cent, respectively. Thetotal number of LSBs remained unchanged at 14 by end2006 with the entry of Lankaputhra Development Bank andthe merger of NDB Housing Bank with the NationalDevelopment Bank of Sri Lanka Ltd. The branch network ofLSBs increased to 409 at end 2006.

Lending by LSBs was concentrated in the housing,industrial and financial sectors. These three sectorsaccounted for 65 per cent of the loans approved during theyear. Due to the existence of banks catering mainly to thehousing sector, lending by LSBs was concentrated in thehousing sector. Investments in the form of governmentsecurities accounted for about 42 per cent of LSBs’ totalassets. The total outstanding loans and deposits of LSBsat end 2006 were Rs. 137 billion and Rs. 250 billion,respectively. Meanwhile, profit before tax of the sectordecreased to Rs. 6.2 billion from Rs. 7.4 billion in 2005.

Registered Finance Companies (RFCs)

Activities of RFCs expanded further and their financialsoundness improved supported by increasedprofitability, capital levels, asset quality andimprovements in compliance with prudentialregulations. The total assets of RFCs grew by around 29per cent to Rs. 113 billion as at in 2006. This largely reflectedan expansion in financial accommodation, particularly in theform of leasing and hire purchase facilities, provided byRFCs. The deposit liabilities of RFCs accounted for 3.7 percent of the total deposit liabilities of major deposit-takinginstitutions regulated by the Central Bank as at end 2006.RFCs continued their business operations concentratingmainly on leasing, hire purchases and real estate activities.The total number of RFCs increased to 29, with the entry ofa new RFC in 2006.

Loans and advances granted by RFCs grew by 29 percent in 2006. The lending rates charged by RFCs werehigher than those charged by LCBs and LSBs due toaccommodation of less creditworthy customers by RFCs.Leasing and hire purchase facilities, accounted for 50 percent of total assets and 70 per cent of total loans in 2006.As the leasing and hire purchase facilities are heavilyconcentrated on purchase of vehicles, a need fordiversification is increasingly being felt. The share of loansgranted for real estate activities remained at around 10 percent of total accommodation and this level of exposure isnot considered as threatening to the stability of the sector.

Deposits, which continued to be the dominant fundingsource, represented 52 per cent of total resources ofRFCs. The RFCs in general were in compliance with theFinance Companies (Capital Funds) Direction No. 1 of 2003in terms of which capital funds shall not be less than 10 per

cent of the deposit liabilities. The other major sources offunds were bank borrowings (16 per cent) and capital funds(15 per cent).

A substantial increase in profitability of RFCs wasrecorded in 2006. Net profits amounted to Rs. 2.3 billion in2006, registering an increase of 14.3 per cent over theprevious year. The majority of the RFCs operated profitably.This reflected that there is further scope for growth in thesector.

Other Financial Institutions

Primary Dealers (PDs): The PDs recovered from thesetback experienced in the previous year and recordedincreases in profits, assets and capital levels in 2006,despite the rising interest rate environment. In general,PDs cut down their portfolios and activities in both primaryand secondary markets, even though, some PDs, especiallythe state sector PDs managed to increase their tradingportfolios during the latter part of the year. However, withthe continuous rise in interest rates, the investor preferenceshifted mostly towards the shorter end of the market. Totalassets of PDs increased by Rs. 5 billion to Rs. 51 billion in2006.

Most of the financial performance indicators of PDsshowed an improvement in 2006. The net profit beforetax of PDs increased to Rs. 550 million in 2006 from Rs.370million in 2005. The return on equity (ROE) increased to 11per cent from 8 per cent, while the return on assets (ROA)increased marginally to 1 per cent. The capital base of PDsalso increased.

The PD system was stable in spite of the volatility ininterest rates in the domestic market. Stress testinganalysis shows that the PD industry would lose only 2.3 percent of capital (Rs. 121 million) if the interest rate moved upby 100 bps from its level as at end 2006. PDs have shiftedtheir portfolios towards the securities with shorter maturities,due to risk of holding of medium and long term Treasurybonds in a rising interest rate scenario.

Bloomberg bond trading platform (E-Bond trader) wasintroduced in 2006 allowing PDs to trade withoutbrokerage. However, usage of this facility was reducedtowards the end of the year, as the rising interest ratesscenario was not conducive to trading in Treasury Bonds.

All PDs were cautious to operate in both the primary aswell as the secondary market throughout the year, asthe increase in interest rates diluted their trading abilityas well as their financial condition. As a result, tradingportfolios of most PDs were curtailed significantly to mitigate“mark to market” losses and capital losses. The income ofPDs was mainly confined to margin income as PDs preferredto operate in the repo market rather than in the outrightmarket.

Specialised Leasing Companies (SLCs): Specialisedleasing companies recorded an improved performancein 2006 in terms of profitability, capital, asset qualityand compliance with prudential regulations. The numberof SLCs stood at 20 as at end 2006. Of these, 7 companiesaccounted for 83 per cent of the total assets of SLCs. Thetotal assets of SLCs increased by 25 per cent to Rs.67 billion,while total finance leases increased by 11 per cent to Rs. 29billion.

As SLCs are not permitted to accept deposits from thepublic, they were mainly dependent on bank borrowingsor funds obtained through the issue of debt securities.As the definition of “deposit” introduced in the Banking(Amendment) Act No. 2 of 2005 is comprehensive, it includesborrowings obtained through the issue of debt instrumentson a regular basis. Therefore, at the request of SLCs, theCentral Bank has recommended an amendment to theFinance Leasing Act No. 56 of 2000 to permit SLCs tomobilise funds through the issue of debt instruments. Theindustry average of gearing ratio (debt to capital) of SLCsstood at approximately 4 : 1 against the permitted maximumratio of 10 : 1, at present, indicating a sound financial position.

A high concentration of the leasing portfolio of SLCs isin respect of vehicle financing, which accounts for 81per cent. However, the risks associated with possibledefaults are mitigated to a large extent, by the nature offinance leases, where the vehicle itself is considered as thesecurity for the accommodation and SLCs have absoluteownership of such vehicles. This concentration is not

considered as a major risk to the industry as vehiclesfinanced are used for purposes such as public transport,goods transport and personal use by a diverse clientele.However, attention is being given to encourage the SLCs todiversify their leasing portfolios by providing facilities forpurchase of capital equipment such as machinery.

Merchant Banks: Merchant-banking activities continuedto boost during 2006 with total asset of the sectorincreasing from Rs. 24.0 billion in 2005 to Rs.31.4 billion.Profit before tax in the industry was Rs. 350 million in 2006,compared to Rs.183 million in the previous year. Leasing,investment in financial instruments and lending activitieshave mainly contributed to the progress in the merchantbanking industry.

Unit Trusts: The performance of unit trust industryimproved in line with the boosting of Colombo bourseactivities and growth in the economy. The total assets of theunit trusts significantly increased by 18.6 per cent to Rs. 5.4billion compared to Rs.4.5 billion in the previous year. Thenet asset value of unit trusts grew by 19.1 per cent supportedby an appreciation of the value of investments and anincrease in number of units in issue. The equity portfoliowas the main instrument of the investments of unit trustsand accounted for about 69 per cent of the total investments.While the share of investments in Treasury bills and Re-purchase agreements had dropped, investments in Treasurybonds had increased during the year.

Venture Capital Firms (VCFs) : The primary business ofVCFs is to provide equity capital for high-risk investments,mainly new ventures launched by entrepreneurs, whichusually promise high returns. There was a marginal declinein activities of VCFs as a result of the stock market boomduring the year, which turned investments in venture capitalsless attractive.

Superannuation Funds: The total assets of superannuationfunds comprising the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), theEmployees’ Trust Fund (ETF), the Public Sector ProvidentFund (PSPF), the Contributory Pension Fund (CPF) and thePrivate Provident Funds (PPFS) grew by 14.0 per cent toRs. 671.5 billion during 2006, which represented 18.2 percent of financial system assets at end of the year.

The EPF, the major retirement benefit fund in the countryfor private sector employees, expanded with an increasein net contributions and investment income. The totalassets of the EPF, which account for about 72 per cent ofthe superannuation funds in the country, grew by 14.9 percent to Rs. 492 billion at the end of 2006. The total investmentportfolio of the EPF consisted mainly of governmentsecurities (96.8 per cent). The EPF earned a gross incomeof Rs.46.4 billion for the year, recording a return of 12.22per cent. An effective rate of return of 10.2 per cent wasdeclared on member balances in 2006, which is higher thanthe annual weighted average deposit rate of 6.8 per cent in2006.

The ETF, the employer contributory retirement benefitscheme in the country, also recorded an increase in itsasset base, with higher net contributions and investmentincome. The total assets of the ETF increased by 14 percent to Rs.67 billion, while total contributions increased by20 per cent to Rs.6 billion in 2006. The total outstandingmember balances in the ETF rose by 15 per cent to Rs.66billion at the end of 2006. Total investments stood at Rs.64billion at the end of 2006 and was heavily concentrated ingovernment securities (93 per cent).

The asset base of the PSPF and the CPF was Rs. 16billion in 2006. In addition, there were 88 approved privateprovident funds, in operation in 2006 with total assetsamounting to Rs. 95 billion.

Even though around two million active memberaccounts are covered by the EPF and the ETF each, thereare over three million informal sector workers who arenot covered by any social security scheme. The CentralBank will actively explore the possibility of introducing aunified voluntary contributory social security scheme to coverthis deprived segment of the work force.

Insurance Companies: The insurance industry recordedsignificant growth in terms of premia, profits and assetsin 2006. With the amalgamation of the National InsuranceCorporation with Janashakthi Insurance Company, and theestablishment of Ceylinco Takaful Insurance Company, thenumber of insurance companies engaged in both life andgeneral insurance in Sri Lanka remained at 15 at end 2006,the same number as the previous year. The insurancecompanies together accounted for 2.9 per cent of the totalassets of the financial system, and grew by 2.1 per cent to

Rs.107.3 billion during 2006. The industry was heavilyconcentrated with over 72 per cent of the assets with thetwo largest firms.

8.3Developments in Financial Markets

Inter-Bank Call Money Market

Reflecting the tighter liquidity position, the volume ofinter-bank transactions increased from Rs. 310 billionduring the first quarter to Rs. 610 billion in the last quarter2006. Correspondingly, the daily average inter-bank callmoney market volume increased gradually from Rs. 5 billionduring first quarter to around Rs. 10 billion during last quarterof the year.

The structural rigidities are apparent in the call money marketas a result of the high concentration of liquidity among a fewbanks and the tax differentials associated with inter bankcall money market transactions in comparison to governmentsecurities transactions.

Domestic Foreign Exchange Market

The level of activity in the inter-bank foreign exchangemarket increased substantially during 2006 reflectinghigher international trade and remittances flows. Duringthe year, the Central Bank permitted commercial banks tooffer rupee based cross currency options to domesticcorporate clients to expand the activities in the foreignexchange market. The customer market, which consists offoreign exchange sales and purchases to and fromcustomers by commercial banks, recorded the highestvolume of transactions since the floating of the rupee.

The Central Bank encouraged domestic commercialbanks to develop oil hedging instruments to facilitatethe oil importing companies entering into hedging to mitigatethe impact of rising oil prices and to reduce volatility in theforeign exchange market. The introduction of hedginginstruments would further develop the domestic foreignexchange market.

Government Securities Market

Rupee Denominated Debt: The government continuedto raise funds through rupee denominated instruments,namely Treasury bonds, Treasury bills and Rupee Loansto meet a part of its budgetary requirements. In view ofthe rising interest rate environment and inflationaryexpectations, the market preference was towards short-termmaturities.

Total issues of Treasury bills in the primary marketincreased in 2006 compared to 2005. The governmentissued Treasury bills amounting to Rs.628 billion in gross

A foreign commercial borrowing througha syndicated loan amounting to USD 100 million with thetenure of 3 years and at a variable interest rate of six monthLIBOR + 75 basis points was obtained to mitigate thepressure on domestic debt securities market and to stabilisethe interest rate structure.

Corporate Debt Securities Market

Commercial Papers: Commercial Paper (CP) marketactivities increased significantly in 2006 and this could bedue to the abolition of the withholding tax on interest incomeduring 2005 and increased economic activities. Total amountof funds raised through CPs increased more than twofold toRs.23.5 billion during the year of 2006, in comparison to Rs.10.9 billion during 2005.

The number of companies listed at the CSE has hoveredaround the present level of 237 for over a decade, asnew listings have been rare during recent years. Thisremains an impediment to the growth of CSE and needs tobe addressed in order to expedite capital marketdevelopments.

8.4Development Finance and Accessto Finance

Development Finance

The expansion of development finance and ruralfinancial sector institutions continued in 2006 with theincrease in the number of branches of banks includingRegional Development Banks. The Central Bank introducedthe Tea Development Project Revolving Fund (TDPRF) andthe Second Perennial Crop Development Project RevolvingFund credit schemes in 2006 to continue support to the teaand perennial crop sectors. The Central Bank continued tooperate 3 different credit schemes designed exclusively fortsunami victims namely Sushanana, Small Business RevivalProject (SBRP) and Jeevana Shakthi Programme. Underthese three schemes, 13,652 loans amounting to Rs. 5.9billion were facilitated during 2006. Out of this 57 per centwas disbursed within the Southern province, and the rest inthe Eastern, Northern and Western provinces.

Preliminary work was completed with respect to two newcredit lines, which will be operational from 2007 fortsunami reconstruction. These credit lines are theConstruction Sector Development Project credit line fundedby the Government of France, which will provide refinancefor loans granted to construction firms undertakinggovernment projects for post-tsunami construction and theEuropean Investment Bank (EIB) credit line (Contract B)which is specifically meant for providing credit to mediumscale enterprises directly affected by the tsunami. TheCentral Bank is to act as the apex institution for thiscomponent of the EIB credit line.

The National Development Trust Fund (NDTF) which isan apex institution for disbursement of micro financecontinued to act as a conduit for two tsunami relatedADB funded credit schemes, namely the Rural FinancialSector Development Programme (RFSDP- reallocated fora tsunami emergency credit line) and the Tsunami AffectedArea Rehabilitation Programme (TAARP). The total fundsdisbursed for tsunami affected districts under theseprogrammes in 2005 and 2006 were Rs. 904 million. These

funds were available at a concessionary interest rate of 6per cent. The NDTF also continued credit delivery throughits partner organisations in the other districts inclusive ofthe North and East.

Enhancement of Access to Finance

During the year several measures were taken to increaseaccess to finance. Central Bank approval was obtained toopen 120 new branches of LCBs and LSBs. Of these, 56branches were opened outside the Western Province.Approval was also obtained to relocate 120 bank branches.In 2006, licences were granted to Lankaputra DevelopmentBank and to Sri Lanka Savings Bank to operate as LSBsand to ICICI Bank Ltd. to operate as an LCB. Outreach ofexisting micro-finance schemes were also widened duringthe year.

The Budget for 2006 proposed to amend bankingregulations to make it mandatory that credit extendedto agriculture, including processing be increased to 10per cent of the credit during the next three years. Asurvey was undertaken to assess the current position oflending to the agriculture sector as banks lend for variouspurposes connected with the agriculture sector directly andindirectly under various schemes. The survey indicates that,of the 37 licensed banks, 28 banks have granted loans toagriculture in excess of the 3 per cent limit proposed for2007. Furthermore, the share of agriculture credit was above5 per cent in 22 banks, while the share of agriculture creditin 14 banks was above 10 per cent. The formulation of anappropriate definition of activities that constitute theagriculture sector and other modalities relating to theimplementation of a requirement of a minimum percentageof loans to be extended to the agriculture sector by banksare under consideration.

8.5Financial Infrastructure

Payment and Settlement Systems

As a safe and efficient infrastructure for payments andsettlements is vital for the proper functioning and stabilityof the financial system, the Central Bank took furthermeasures to strengthen the payments and settlementsystems and to improve oversight of the systems,thereby minimising the risks involved.

The Central Bank continued to operate LankaSettle, thesystemically important high value payment andsecurities settlement system. The LankaSettle system hastwo components i.e., the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)system, which processes large value and time criticalpayments, and the LankaSecure system, the ScriplessSecurities Settlement (SSS) System, which handles thesettlement of securities transactions on a Delivery versusPayment basis (DvP). Both, the RTGS and SSS systemavailability was at 99.78 per cent during 2006.
