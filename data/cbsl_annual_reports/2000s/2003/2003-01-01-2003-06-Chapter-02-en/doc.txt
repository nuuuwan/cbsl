2.1 Overall Trends

In 2003, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 5.9 per cent,

in real terms, continuing the recovery process that began from

the second half of 2002. This growth was better than the growthof 5.5 per cent forecast for 2003 at the beginning of the year.

The quarterly growth rates in 2003 were stable, in a range of

5.4 per cent to 6.9 per cent, the most stable quarterly growth

rates during a year since the compilation of quarterly national

accounts cornmenced in 1996. In comparison, the range in 2001

varied from -3.9 per cent to 1.8 per cent and in 2002, from 0.3

per cent to 7.0 per cent. Moreovet, growth was recorded in all

three major economic sectors throughout the year, with most

sub sectors growing at a faster pace than in the previous year.

These statistics reflected the stability and the predictability in

economic activity that prevailed throughout 2003. They also

emphasised the potential fbr longer-term sustainability of a

broad based, stable economic growth trend in response to

improved macro-economic fundamentals.

ln 2002, the economy recovered from the recession

experienced in 2001, and the growth was sufflcient to regain

the per capita income, in real terms, that had prevailed in 2000.

By end 2003, per capita income had increased, in nominal

terms, by nearly l0 per cent, which togethel' with a GDP

deflator of around 5 per cent ret'lected a real increase in per

capita income of 4.6 per cent, signitying, on average, an

improvement in living standards.

Two key factors supported the growth achieved in 2003.'l'he first was the continuation of the ceasefit'c lnd the peaceinitiative which expanded economic activity by enablingcomparatively free mobility of goods, services and labour

throughout the entire country. The second was improved

macroeconomic management, including prudent monetary

management, greater fiscal discipline, and structural reforms,albeit with delays in some areas, that supported declining

interest rates, a stable foreign exchange market, and falling

inflation. This led to increases in both aggregale demand andsupply through a rise in both consumer and investor

confidence, In addition, favourable weather conditions, despite

the severe floods experienced in May, also contributed to

positive growth in a-qriculture and to an uninterrupted power

supply throughout the year. The improving international

economic environment also impacted positively on economic

activiry in 2003.Meanwhile , in 2003, Gross National Product (GNP)'

defined as GDP adjusted for net factor income from abroad(NFIA), grew by 6.4 per cent in real terms, compared to a

growth of 4.1 per cent in2002. GNP growth in 2003 was higher

than GDP growth by a greater margin than the historical

pattern, due to the better performance of NFIA. NFIA, though

remaining negative, improved by 26 per cent owing to receipts

increasing at a higher rate than payments. Interest eamings

improved in 2003 owing to the higher external reserves of thecountry compared with 2002, while improved reserves

management also contributed to this increase.

The economic growth in 2003 was broad based. All threesectors, Agriculture, Industry, and Services, grew and

contributed to overall economic growth. However, the Services

sector dominated. Services activities grew by 7 -7 per cent and

contributed 70 per cent of growth. The resurgence of consumer

confidence created demand for services such as trade; hotels,

entertainment and related activities; communications; goods

and passenger transport; financial and port services, all of

which grew healthily. One exception was public administration

and defence, following a policy decision to curtail expansion

in the public sector unless considered essential as a part of the

medium term fiscal consolidation strategy. The emergence of

the Services sector as the fastest growing sector was not limited

to Sri Lanka. In 2003, the Services sector provided the impetusfor growth in most East Asian economies as well as in India.

Meanwhile, the Industry sector, which grew by 1.0 per cent in

the previous year, regained some of its growth momentum in

2003, with a growth of 5.5 per cent and a contribution of 25 per

cent of the overall grtlwth. This recovery in Industry also

irnpacted positively on the Services sector, as the demancl for

related services increased. However, this growth was still

below the average growth rate of the Industry sector prior to2001. The Agriculture sector grew by 1.5 per cent. This sector,which contracted by 3.4 per cent in 2001 under adverse weatherconditions, recorded a growth of 2.5 per cent in 2002. Thisgrowth in 2003 confirms full recovery of the Agriculture sectorfrom the contraction in 2001. However, this also shows thatgrowth in this sector has not achieved the dynamism of theother two sectors, and continues to lag behind due to inherentrigidities.On the expenditure front, GDP at current market prices

was estimated at Rs. 1,760 billion, in 2003, compared with Rs.1,583 billionrn2002, recording an increase of ll.2 per cent innominal terms.

comparison to 8.4 per cent in2002. The comparatively lowerlevel of inflation was achieved through the increase in localproduction to meet the higher demand and improvedmacroeconomic stability. The declining trend in inflation was

also reflected in all other price indices. Accordingly, GDP per

capita for 2003 is estimated at Rs. 91,434, an increase of 9.8

per cent over the previous year's Rs. 83,267. This indicates animprovement in living standards, on average, as the growth inper capita income surpassed the increase in inf'lation.

dollar. The higher demand for services also reflects thatwith the rise in per capita income, on average, a relative share

of consumer expenditure is shifting away from goods to satisf y

basic needs such as food and clothing to consdmer expenditure

on services of their choice.

GDP at market prices, when estimated by the expenditure

approach, reflects the totaldemand in the economy comprisingboth domestic and external demand. Domestic demand,(consumption plus investment demand) rose by 10.9 per cent

at current market prices. [n2002, the corresponding increase

was 13.1 per cent. However, with the decline in inflation, real

domestic demand grew at a higher pace in 2003 than in2002,

indicating an increase in real purchasing power in the economy.The recovery in 2002, from the first ever economic

contraction in 2001, was driven by consumer confidence. The

cessation of hostilities and the resultant peaceful environmentthat prevailed in the country paved the way for consumption

driven growth, Of the overall growth in domestic demand of 6.6per cent in2002, nearly 80 per cent came from the increase in

consumption expenditure. The investors' response was not asrapid and it was evident that investors were awaiting firmer

signals on the success of the peace process during 2002, and the

expected growth in investor confidence was seen by the secondhalf of 2003.

The growth in consumer confidence that was seen in 2002

continued in 2003 as well, but at a somewhat slower pace. Thetotal consumption expenditure, which includes private andgovernment consumption expenditure, increased in current

terms, by 9.6 per cent. This increase was solely due to the 10.7

per cent expansion in private consumption expenditure (PCE),

which represents around 9l per cent of the total. Govemmentconsumption expenditure continued to decline, thoughmarginally, due to commendable fiscal consolidation efforts.Total consumption expenditure in real terms grew by 6.1 percent exceeding the real economic growth. The ceasefirethroughout the country was the primary factor that enhanced

the demand for goods and services. The increase in domestic

production, declining inflation, and falling interest rates furtherencouraged consumer demand. Increases in domestic

agricultural income owing to the higher production also raised

the demand for consumer durables in 2003. The increase in

imports of consumer goods by 12.5 per cent, in volume terms,

in agricultural production that caters to the domestic market andin domestic market oriented industries also reflected higher

consumer expenditure, in real terms, in 2003. In real terms,

PCE grew by 7 .3 per cent, against a population growth of 1.3per cent, indicating an improvement in living standards.

Consumption expenditure was responsible for 58 per cent of

the 8.4 per cent growth in domestic demand in 2003.Investment expenditure (Gross Domestic Capital

Formation) at current market prices, which increased by 9,I per

cent in 2002, increased further by 16,3 per cent in 2003. In realterms, the investment expenditure rose by 17.0 per cent,

whereas the conesponding growth in2002 was 6.7 per cent.The higher growth in investment in real terms in 2003,

compared to current terms, reflects the decline in the prices ofinvestment goods in 2003 compared with 2002. The realgrowth compared to 2002 was reflected in many sectors andconfirmed that the investment climate, which had lagged

behind consumption earlier, had improved significantly by

2003. The Investment/GDP ratio had fallen from 28.0 per cent

in 2000 to22.0 per cent in 2001 .In2002, thou_eh the economygrew by 4.0 per cent, the investment ratio declined further to2L3 per cent, signifying the delay in investment decisions.Another factor that delayed new investment in 2002 was theexcess capacity that existed in most economic sectors. Thistrend reversed in 2003 and the investment ratio rose to 22.3 percent, confirming growing investor confidence, The turnaroundin investment was mostly observed in the second half of theyear as indicated by a sustained growth in private sector creditand a noticeable increase in the imports of investment goodsduring that period. However, the investment ratio is still belowthe level of 24 per cent initially projected for 2003 at thebe-tinning of the year. The under-performance of capitalformation was due to two major reasons. First, certain keyeconomic sectors (e.g. export manufacturing and tourism) stillperformed at below existing capacity so that there was noimmediate need for new investments in these sectors, Second,thou,eh the cessation of hostilities continued and a peacefulenvironment prevailed throughout the country, investorsadopted a 'wait and see' policy to make investment decisionsdue to uncertainties that prevailed in both the peace process andthe political environment. An investment level of 22.3 per centis not sufficient to achieve the long-term envisaged growth ofover 8 per cent that would be required for a sustainableimprovement in living standards. In the long-run, the speedyimplementation of power capacity expansion, labour marketand land market reforms, further dere,eulation to reduceadministrative bottlenecks, and further improvement in policyconsistency are crucial to convert increasing investorconfidence into real investment activity.On the resource side, domestic savings, the sum of privateand government savings, were estimated at Rs. 27J bjllion, anincrease of 20.9 per cent, in nominal terms. In 2002, thecorresponding increase was 3.3 per cent. As the increase indomestic savings exceeded that in GDP, the domestic savings/GDP ratio rose to 15.7 per cent in 2003 from 14.5 per cent in2002. Both the private sector and the government sectorcontributed to the improvement. Private savings increased by12.4 per cent, in nominal terms, while the private savings ratio,which was 18.8 per cent, improved to 19.0 per cent. Of theprivate savings, corporate sector savings increased due to betterperfbrmance during the period. However, household sectorsavings declined due to higher consumer e xpenditurethroughout the period. Government dis-savings, whichimproved marginally to 4.4 per cent of GDP in2002after risingdrastically during the previous two years, improved to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2003, due to continuation of prudent budgetarypolicies. The Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, rhat waspassed in Parliament at end 2002 andstipulated a medium termflscal strategy for reduction of the budget deficit to 5 per centof GDP by 2006, impacted on the improvement in governmentdis-savings. The national savings ratio also increased from 19.5per cent to 21.3 per cent. The gap between domestic savingsand national savings widened in 2003, compared with 2002,

due to the improvements in NFIA and increase in net privatetransfers from abload by 10.8 per cent. The resource gap, theinvestment - national savings gap as a ratio of GDP, stood at1.0 per cent. Despite this moderate gap, the low levels ininvestment and savings that remained below the projectionsmade at the beginning of the year, despite improvements over2002levelq raise concerns, as they are inadequate to achievethe expected high growth in the future.

2.2 Sectoral Performance

Services Sector

The Services sector grew by 7 .7 per cent contributing 70 percent of overall growth. The recovery in economic activity thatbegan from the second half of 2002 was driven by the growthof the Services sector. The Services sector had two advantagesover the other two sectors. First, the demand for serviceactivities such as trade, transport, tourism, financial services,port services and communication, increased at a higher rate, inthe context of growing consumer confidence with thecontinuation of the ceasefire, than the demand for goods.Second, the economy was able to cater to this growing demandwithin existing capacity.The faster growth of services sector and its continuouslyrising share in GDP in Sri Lanka are consistent with the usualdevelopment process of a country. The initial stages ofeconomic development require a firm structural foundation tobe laid by agriculture and industry. However, at the next stage,an efficient services sector is required to link production,distribution and consumption together, by lowering transactioncosts and improving efficiency, while raising the quality of lifeof people, by enhancing their choices and increasingconvenience. Hence, the dominance of the Services sectorusually moves in tandem with a country evolving from low-income to high-income. In particular, as Sri Lanka has a lownatural resource base, the magnitude and pace of futureeconomic growth will rely heavily on the Services sector, ashas been observed in the recent past.Value added in the Transport, storage and communicationsector increased by I0.2 per cent in2003, compared to 7.6 percent in 2002. This increase was largely due to the expansion inthe telecommunication subsector by 245 per cent. The FixedAccess-Wireless Local Loop subscriber levels grew by 1.3 percent, in comparison to a 3,8 per cent drop in 2002. The growthin the telecommunication sector was mainly driven by theupward trend in mobile phone usage that increased by 54 percent. A growth of 2l per cent in Internet and e-mail users wasrecorded. The growth in the telecommunication sector wasaugmented by the growing demand from the Northem and theEastern provinces for communication services, following theceasefire.The transport subsector, one of the largest service sectorsin the economy, grew by 3.8 per cent as against 3,6 per cent inthe previous year. This increase was the outcome of the

Part IChapter 2 - NATIONAL INCOME AND EXPENDITURE

combined performance of passenger and freight transport. Road

haulage grew by 4.4per cent reflecting the expansion in goods

transport activities with the opening and greater use of roads

to the North and the East following the ceasefire, the inclease

in domestic production and in international trade. During 2003,

passenger kilometres operated by Sri Lanka Rarlways increasedby 4.4 per cent as compared with 2.5 per cent in 2002.\n

comparison to the negative growth of 5.7 per cent in passengerkilometres flown by Sri Lankan Airlines during 2002, an

increase of I2.l per cent was recorded in 2003. In the public

transport category, the growth performance in the private bus

category improved, while that of Sri Lanka Transport Board

contracted. The use of taxis, hired vans and three wheelers has

also increased. These improvements in the transport sector

were also reflected in the significant increase in imports and

registration of motor vehicles during 2002 and 2003.

Port services recorded a growth of 10.8 per cent in 2003

as against 2.4 per cent in the previous year. The Port of

Colombo including the South Asia Gateway Terminal (SAGT)

handled a record volume of 1.96 million TEUs in 2003, up 10.8

per cent compaled with the container throughput of 1.76million TEUs in2002. This was the highest container volume

handled by the port and was a significant achievement when

compared with stagnation in throughput levels during the last

five years. Transshipment volumes, which usually account fortwo-thirds of throughput and experienced negative growth

during the last five years except tn2002, recorded a growth of

12.2per cent in 2003. The Colombo Port's success in 2003 was

mainly driven by the Jaye Container Terminal (JCT). Of the

total container throughput of 1.96 million TEUs, 68 per cent (or

1.33 million TEUs) was handled at JCT. JCT recorded a growthof 10.6 per cent in total container handling and 14.2 per cent

in transshipment container handling. This high growth reflects

steps taken by the SLPA to enhance productivity such as avoluntary retirement scheme introduced for surplus workers,

24-hour work arrangements and incentive payments. Also,

marketing strategies fbllowed by the SLPA were able to attract

new shipping lines to provide services on a continuous basis to

the Port of Colombo.

The Wholesale and retail trade sector, the largest sector in

terms of value added, grew by 7.3 per cent. The growth was

largely due to the improved performance of the import trade

subsector, which grew by ll2per cent. This subsector, which

suffered a seve re setback in 2001, recovercd in 2002 owing to

the increase in domestic demand. This trend continued in 2003with the continuation of consumer confidence that prevailed

throughout the year and revival in investor confidence by the

second half of 2003. The import of investment goods increasedin 2003 by 28.7 per cent, in volume terms, while that of

consumer goods increased by 12.5 per cent. The volume of

intermediate goods imports also grew by 4.1 per cent, mainlydriven by raw material imports for industries catering to the

domestic market. The decline in the international prices of

investment goods, by 11.7 per cent on average, also stimulated

the importation of investment goods. Of consumer goods

imports, imports of basic food items, such as rice, wheat grain

and sugar, declined in the light of the increases in domestic

production of rice and sugar, and substitution effects. Imports

of other consumer goods, such as motor vehicles and household

goods, grew by 25.3 per cent. The domestic trade subsector,defined as the trading of domestically produced and traded

goods, grew by 4.4per cent. This growth was stimulated by the

increase in consumer confidence, higher domestic production

and low level of inflation. The export trade subsector, which

suffered a setback of 8.0 per cent in 2001 and then grew by 2.0

per cent tn2002, grew by 3.5 per cent in 2003. Exports of

agricultural products grew by 5.5 per cent, led by the recovery

in coconut products expot'ts by 24 per cent. Industrial products

exports grew by 3.1 per cent. Among industrial exports, the

textiles and garments sector, which accounts tbr around 67 percent of this category, grew modestly by 2.5 per cent.

Meanwhile, all other industrial exports, which accounted for 30

per cent of industrial exports excluding petroleum, performed

better, and grew by 5.3 per cent. Both exports and importsperformed better than the projections for 2003 made at the

beginning of the year.

The Banking, insurance and the realestate sector recorded

the highest growth of 10.6 per cent. The growth in the banking

sector by 15.3 per cent was mainly responsible. Interest income

in the banking sector, which still covers over 80 per cent of the

total income of that sector, remained constant at the previous

year's level. However, interest expenses dropped by l6 per

cent, under declining interest rates, enhancing the net interestearnings of the banking sector. This further reflects the

downward rigidity in lending rates in the banking sector in Sri

Lanka, clearly implying that the pass-through to investors, in

particular, and the economy in general, of the advantages of

lower interest rates, is slow. Meanwhile, non interest income

in the banking sectot, in current terms, increased by 27 per cent.

Increased profits from activities in the foreign exchange market

and increased commissions and brokerage income from fee-

based activities were the main reasons for this increase, Thelicensed specialised banking sector gained mainly from

securities sales in the context of the buoyancy in the stock

market throughout most of the year. The insurance, real estate

and other financial services sector also grew healthily by 7.1

per cent, reflecting the continuing demand for such services,

which recorded a 6.6 per cent growth in 2002 as well.The Services (n.e.s,) category, which includes all other

unclassified services such as private education, health, hotels

and restaurants, advertising, private security, j ani torial services,

personal services and all other business services, grew by 7.2per cent. This was mainly due to enhanced activities in the

hotels and restaurants services, as well as other subsectors, such

as advertising and motor and electrical repairs, albeit to a lesser

degree. Hotels and restaurants services expanded significantlywith the increase in toulist arrivals mainly from Western

Europe and Asia. In 2003, tourist anivals increased by 27.3 per

sector. While both exports and imports increased in volumeterms, their composition changed to meet the needs of thediveLsified economy. The re lative shares of industrialproducts in exports and intermediate and investment goodsin imports rose over time to displace primary agriculruralcommodities as the main component of exports andconsumer goods as the main component of imports.Meanwhile, per capita inc.ome increased from US dollars120 jn 1950 to US dollars 941 in2003, growing by 4 percent per year, on average.

TABLE 1Structure of the Economy in Sri LankaHistorical Progress

At Independence, at that early stage of her developmentprocess, Sri Lanka was heavily dependent on agriculture interms of output and employment. The Agriculrure sectorconsisted marnly of three export commodities, [ea, rubberand coconut; and the production of paddy. The latterprovided a livelihood tor a signifrcant proportion of thepopulation in the country who lived in rural areas. TheAgriculture sector contributed nearly one half of the GDPand employed more than 40 per cent of the labour force inthe country. The share of the Industry sector was less than20 per cent of GDP and it was mainly confined to theprocessing of the major agriculiural crops and to a fewmedium sized industrial plants producing basic needs suchas cement, textiles and soa le traditionalindustries such as handicra ets and brickmaking that catered to rural . Even at thatstage; Services sector activiries were responsible for nearly

In the early period afterlndependence, development ofthe Agriculture sector had been given very high prioriry. Ata later period, Services sector activities such as trade,transport, telecommunication and postal services andbanking and other financial services had been dominated bystate monopolies, causin,e a reduction in efficiency andthereby the sectoral growth rates. The Services sector hadfurther been affected by exchange controls, nationalisationof private businesses, high taxes and complex tariffstructures. With rationing and control systems; consumerchoices had been supplanted by community choices effectedthrough planners' preferences. These restrictions onServices sector growth not only reduced overall growth and

More recently, as the economy developed anddiversified, there was a need for a fast growing. moredynamic Services sector that could provide modern,efficient and convenient links between production andconsumption. These shortcomings were identified and

priyate sector participation in Services activities was

encouraged through refbrms that liberalised trade, transport,communications and financial services, Even in those

sectors that were reserved for the state, e.g,, monopolies intelecommunication, transport and postal services, acompetitive environment towards improving efficiency ofthe services provided was created by permitting private

sector participation. These retbrms aimed at expanding theServices sector to meet emerging needs and also atencouraging: activities in Services subsectors such asinternational transport, telecommunications and financial

services, where Sn Lanka has a comparative/competitiveadvantage over other countries in the region and stood togain from her close ploximity to India, as the Indianeconomy expanded and moved to a higher growth path.

Regional Comparison

Sri Lanka's experience is comparable with that of other

countries in the region, In Korea, during a period of 17 yearsfrom 1985 to 2002, the Services sector share increased from47 per cent to 55 per cent of GDP, whereas the Agriculture

sector share decreased from 13 per cent to 4 per cent. India"with a more diversitled resource base and a largel domesticmarket, also recorded the same trend. The experience ofThailand and Malaysia that have more natural resources was

somewhat difi'erent; the Industry and Services sector sharesboth grerv to replace Agriculture, In Singapore, which hasa low natulal resource base, the Services sector has

accounted for two thirds of GDP during the last 20 years.

Conclusions

The faster growth of the services sector and its continuouslyrising shale in Sri Lanka's economy are in line with thenornal trend that has been observed in the developmentprocess of a country. At the initial phases of economicdevetopment, Agriculture and Industry, includingconstruction, provide a firm structural foundation to aneconomy. Ilowever, at later stages, the sustainability of

these sectors as creators of wealth will depend crucially on

the existence of an efficient Ser vices sector. This is becausethe Services sector links the three basic activities of an

economy - production, distribution and consumption, whileit also raises the quality of lit'e of people by enhancing theirchoice set, lowering transaction costs and increasing

convenience. Hence, when a country evolves t'rom low -income to high - income; a norrnal trend has been theincreasing share of its Services sector in the economy- This

sector is particularly important tbr Sri Lanka, as its natural

resource base is relatively low, An efficient production

system requires the delivery of inputs to production units,satisfying three requirements ' timeliness, quantity andquality. At the other end of the production line,consumption too requires that the final products bedelivered to the consumer, satisfying the same threerequirements - timeliness, quantity and quality. It is theServices sector which fulfils these requirements andfacilitates production, distribution, and consumption toperform efficiently. Hence, the growth of the Services

sector should be viewed as a salutary development, and not

as a growing structural,weakness in the economy.

Following the United Kingdom with93,27g arrivals,India continued its position as the second major touristgenerating market with 90,603 anivals. The hotels were ableto increase their profitability fiom higher occupancy by forei-entourists. During the year, fbreign guest nights rose by 329 percent fiom the marginal drop recorded inZ}}z,while locar guestnights of all graded hotels recorded an increase of j .5 per cent.Consequently, hotels and restaurants services grew by 22.0percent, in real terms, in 2003. The advertising subsector recordeda healthy growth of 13.6 per cenr in2003, with the risingconsumer demand and ensuing competition from suppliers inmany sectors. Repairs of motor vehicles, motorcycles andpersonal and household goods rose by l l.7 per cent followingthe rapid increase in the importation of those items in the recentpast.

Industry Sector

The Industry sector, which comprises Manufacturing,Construction, Mining and quanying, and Electricity, gas andwater, grew by 5.5 per cent in 2003 andcontributed 25 per centof overall growth. This sector contracted in 2001 by 2.1 percent and grew by 1.0 per cent in 2002.In this context, theperformance of the Industry sector in 2003 displays a completerecovery from the setback in 2001. All sub-categoriescontributed to the recovery.The Manufacturing sector, the largest subsector inIndustry, grew by 4.4per cent in 2003. The growth in factoryindustry and small industry was mainly responsible for thisgrowth. The factory industry subsector, which covers theproduction of large and medium-scale industries, grew by 4.6per cent in 2003. This subsector contracted by 3.9 per cent in2001 and recovered partly in2002by 2.5 per cenr due ro thefavourable performance of domestic market orientedindustries. In 2003, domestic oriented industries continueo togrow in response to sustained consumer confidence. Thefood, beverages and tobacco category grew by 6.3 per cent,with the production of processed fbods growing by 7.3 percent and liquor by 12.0 per cent. The decline in the tobaccoindustry was 3.5 per cent. High rates of taxes on tobaccothreatened the industry, togerher with illegally importedcigarettes that were available in the market. Domestic marketoriented industries such as wood and wood products, plasticand PVC products, cement, basic metal products, andfabricated metal products also performed well during theperiod mainly due to the increased demand from constructionactivities. The export market oriented industries, whichcontracted severely in 2001, and recovered marginally in2002, grew at a modest rate of 2.6 per cent. The combinedgrowth of 2002 and 2003 was not sufficient to offset thecontraction experienced in 2001. This raises concerns, asexport-oriented industries account fbr 60 per cent of factoryindustry and are important in terms of value addition,employment generation, and fbreign exchange earnings.

The textiles, apparel and leather products subsector, thelargest industrial subsector in factory industry, grew by 2.7 percent in 2003. The competitiveness of Sri Lankan products thatwas maintained with aggressive cost cutting and an improvedreal effective exchange rate helped this growth. However, therecovery of the garment industry was slower than expected dueto the slower recovery of major importing countries such asUSA and Japan, continuing def'lationary pressures in someinternational markets and intense competition from low costmanufacturing countries, such as China and those in EastEurope. Of the export-oliented industries, rubber productsrecorded the highest groivth of 22 per cent. The demand forrubber based products such as rubber gloves and industrial tyresincreased, despite severe competition from China, as a resultof close relations with globalretailers, continuous improvementin quality and advanced marketing strategies. Under the IndoLanka Free Trade Agreement, domestic tyre manufacturersexplored the Indian market in 2003, for the first time.Small industries grew by 6.I per cent, compared with thegrowth of 2.1per cent in2002. The paddy milling industry, themost widespread small industry in the country, performed wellin 2003 due to the bumper paddy harvest. The bakery industryalso grew amidst the growing demand for prepared foods.Small industries such as timber mills, rock and metal products,and tiles, bricks, cement blocks and related products benefitedfrom the growth in the construction industry.The Electricity, water and gas sector grew by 2L7 per centin 2003, in contrast to the 0.7 per cent decrease in the previousyear. Electricity generation during the first half of the yearincreased by 17 .4 per cent on the low base in the conespondingperiod of last year where power cuts were imposed till mid May2002.In the second half of the year, generation rose by 6.9 percent, resulting in an annual increase of 11.7 per cent. Thedemand for electricity grew by 129 per cent during the year,mainly due to high growth in the industrial and commercialsectors. Hydropower generation by the CEB and private powerproducers increased by 22.9 per cent, while thermal powergeneration increased by 4.5 per cent. During the year a 163MW combined cycle thermalpower plant constructed by AES(Pvt.) Ltd and the 70 MW Kukule Ganga hydropower planrwere cornmissioned in February and September, respectively.Consequently, installed capacity expanded by l0 per cent andthe value addition in the electricity subsector increased by 25.3per cent due to higher generation of low cost hydropower,particularly in the second quarter, and lower usage of high costhired thermal power from the second quarter onwards. Duringthe year, 56.5 per cent of the total electricity was generatedthermally,'in comparison to 60.4 per cent in2002.Meanwhile,water distribution increased by 1.4 per cent compared with 3.8per cent in the previous year.

The Construction sector grew by 5.5 per cenr in 2003. Thissector had faced difficulties in 2001 with the economicrecession and even though the overall economy recovered in2002, with a moderate growth, this sector contracted by 0.8 per

cent due to the low level of investment that prevailed and weakimplementation of large-scale government projects. The

growth in 2003 came from both public investment and private

sector small and medium scale activities such as construction

of apartment complexes and condominiums, supermalkets andretail trade outlets, fuel pumping stations, and individual

housing projects. Large-scale road construction projects in both

the Southern and Northern parts of the country contributed to

the growth perfbrmance of the construction sector. The growthin the construction sector was also consistent with the high

production, imports and sales of cement and other construction

materials.

Agriculture Sector

The Agriculture sector, which expanded by 2.5 per cent in theprevious year, grew by 1.5 per cent in 2003 under structuralrigidities and mixed weather conditions. The relative

importance of the Agriculture sector continued to decline from

19.8 per cent in 2002 to 19.0 per cent in 2003. In 2003, theproduction of most major crops such as vegetables, paddy,

coconut, rubber and minor export crops improved, while tea,subsidiary food crops and tobacco production were

unsatisfactory. The f'lood situation in some parts of the countryin mid 2003 advetsely affected the output of most agricultural

products.In plantation agriculture, tea production dipped slightlywith an output of 303.2 million kg. This was a decline of 2.2

per cent, There had been seven consecutive record tea harveststill 2002, when output was an all time high amounting to 310million kg. The main contributory factor towards the declinein 2003 was the output drop of 6.2 per cent from the high-

grown sector due to dry weather conditions at the end of the

year, Production in the low grown areas was affected by themid-year rains and subsequent floods and earthslips that

resulted in a marginal decline in low grown teas. The pilces,

which were adversely affected by the Iraqi war in the first halfof the year, became attractive in the latter half. Overall, tea

prices declined marginally by 0.3 per cent, on average, in 2003.

Exports of tea in 2003 amounted to 298,3 million kg, which is

an all time record and an increase of 6.5 million kg over 2002.Despite a notable price hike of 5l per cent, rubber

production in 2003 increased only marginally by 1.7 per cent,

However production was on an increasing trend till September

2003. The recovery in international prices is attlibuted toproduction cutbacks by major rubber producers in East Asia

and higher demand on the back of improved world economicgrowth. Domestic consumption, which absorbs about 60 per

cent of total production, has been growing at a faster pace with

the expansion of rubber manufacturing indush'ies.

Coconut production, which had declined continuously

since the first quarter of 2001, recorded a 7.1 per cent growthin 2003. Coconut output amounted to 2,562 million nuts,

against the2,392 million nuts in 2002 due to the lagged eff'ectof the favourable weather that prevailed durine 2002. It is

expected that this growth will continue in the near term. The

increase in output was ref'lected in the decrease in annual

average producer prices by I 1.6 per cent. Further, the decline

in prices was 26 per cent in the second half of the year.In domestic agliculture, paddy production in 2003 was

3.067 million metric tons, an increase of 7 .2 per cent over theprevious year. The paddy output in both Maha and Yala

seasons were alltime records. During 200212003 Maha, paddy

output was 1.895 million metric tons, an increase of 6.8 per

cent over the previous Maha season. Yala output increased by

7.9 per cent recording a harvest of L172 million metric tons.

The value addition for the year recorded an increase of 7 ,4 per

cent. The ongoing peace process has enabled paddy cultivationin areas in the North and the East, which had earlier been

abandoned due to the civil conf'lict, Also, favourable weather

conditions facilitated a high level of output. The area cultivated

increased by 15.2 per cent, while that in the North and the East

lose by 17.8 per cent. However the yield per hectare declined

due to the cultivation of marginal lands, Decline in paddy

prices by 8,6 per cent and the dlop in imports of rice in volume

terms by 64per cent clearly reflect the high production volumes

during the cultivation year.

Subsidiary food crops mainly include potatoes, chillies, red onions,big onions, green gram, cowpea and kurakkan.Minor export crops mainly include coffee, pepper, cinnamon,cloves, cashew nuts and betel leaves.Animal husbandry comprises milk, eggs, poultry and other meats.

Value added in the other agriculture subsector, which

consists of vegetables, subsidiary tood ctops, minor exportcrops, animal husbandry, sugarcane, tobacco and fruits,

increased by 1.8 per cent in 2003. In this category, vegetableproduction increased by 4.0 per cent. Almost all varieties oflow country vegetable production increased, while the

production levels of most up country vegetables declined. The

subsidiary food crops category recorded a decline of 4.3 per

cent. This decline was a consequence of the combined effectof 1.2 per cent growth in the Maha season and 10.5 per cent

decline in the Yala season. The decline in the production ofpotatoes was mainly responsible for the decline in the

production of subsidiary food crops.

Ploduction in the minor export crops category increasedby 4.6 per cent, Export volumes of coffee, nutmeg and mace,cardamoms and betel leaves grew. Export earnings, however,dropped by 22.5 per cent relative to the 52 per cent growthrecorded in2002. Tobacco production declined by 3.5 per centmainly owing to the setback in the tobacco industry mentionedearlier. The animal husbandry subsector recorded a growth of1.8 per cent during the year. Poultry meat production grew by3.6 per cent during 2003 in compadson to the growth of 4.7 percent in 2002. Meanwhile, value added in milk productionincreased by 1.2 per cent, amidst the adverse etfects of highinput costs, parlicularly the price of cattle feed.According to primary data sources, fish production duringthe year declined by 5.5 per cent. This decline was thecombined outcome of the decline in output in the marine sectorby 6.8 per cent and an increase in output of inland fisheries by7.6per cent, leading to a decline in value addition by 6.9 percent for that sector. The drop in marine fish production isattributed to the depletion in the fleet of murtiday boats as wellas the loss of fishing days due to bad weather experienced inthe southern and Northwestern coastal areas during the monthsof May and June in2003. Fishing in the Northern territorialwaters was also apparently affected by poaching. The drop inoutput was reflected in the increase in fish prices by 7.4 percent, on average. While domestic a-ericulturalproduction in theNorth and the East has responded positively to the ceasefire,such positive developments are yet to be realised in thefisherres sector even after 2 years. One reason cited is thelimited refrigeration and other infrastructure facilities for thetransport of fish from these areas.

2.3 Expenditure

The aggregate demand generated by domestic economicactivity is measured by Gross Domestic Expenditure (GDE),which is the sum of consumption and investment expenditureof the private and public sectors of the economy. In 2003, GDEor total domestic demand was estimated at Rs. 1,876 billion, atcurrent market prices, reflecting an increase of 10.9 per centover 2002.In comparison, domestic demand increased by 13.Iper cent tn2002 in nominal terms. In2002, the real increase indomestic demand was 6.6 per cent whereas in 2003 thecorresponding increase was 8.4 per cent. The higher increasein 2003 reflects higher consumer and investor confidence in aconducive macroeconomic environment, as well as the lowerinflation that prevailed in 2003. Of the total expenditure,consumption expenditure accounted for 78 per cent, the samelevel that prevailed in2002. GDP at market prices, the sum ofGDE and net imports, was estimated at Rs. 1,760 billion, anincrease of 11.2 per cent.Consumption expenditure at current market prices wasestimated at Rs, 1,483 billion, an increase of 9.6 per cent overthe previous year. This reflects an increase of 3.2 per cent inthe average price level and of real consumption by 6. I per cent.Of the total consumption, PCE rose by 10.7 per cent whilegovernment consumption, which declined by 3.6 per cent in2002, continued to decline in 2003, Consequently, the share ofPCE increased to 9l per cent of total consumption expenditurefrom 90 per cent in the previous year. In recent years, it wasobserved that government consumption has been graduallyshrinking with diminishing public sector economic activity inline with the policy of private sector led economic growth.

PCE, the expenditure on locally ploduced goods incleased by

9.2per cent, while the expenditure on imported goods and non-

factor services increased by 14.l per cent due to the significant

rise in domestic demand.

Of the PCE, the highest expenditure was fbr food and non-alcoholic beverages, as in previous years. However, the relative

importance of this category declined from 37 per cent in2002to 34 per cent in 2003. The declining importance of thrs

category was observed since these data series began in 1996.With the improvement in living standards and quality of life,

the relative share of expenditure on basic needs such as food

has diversified to other sectors, In 2003, the expenditure onfood and non-alcoholic beverages grew by 1.7 per cent, thelowest growth in all categories. The decline in prices of

essential commodities in 2003, such as rice, sugar, coconut,

coconut oil and some subsidiary food crops, led to this slowgrowth, The expenditure share on clothing declined marginally

and remained at below 6 per cent. The highest growth of 48 per

cent was recorded fbr transportation. The increase was reflectedin the increase in imports and new legistlations of motorvehicles, in 2003. Also, the higher consumption of fuel for

transportation, despite the increase in prices, also contributed

to the higher expenditure on transportation. The expenditure on

communications also increased in 2003, by 33 per cent. Thiswas supported by the increased availability and use of

telecommunication facilities island-wide. Howevet, the share

of communication still remains at2.2 per cent of total PCE. Inaddition, the expenditure on housing and utilities, health, and

miscellaneous goods and services also increased at significantrates. Almost all these categories indicated an increase in

consumption, in real terms. The purpose-wise classification of

PCE (Appendix Table 7) revealed that the economic glowth in

2003 was mostly based on services activities. The statistics

revealed that the demand for goods increased at a relatively

slower pace compared with that for services, enabling services

activities to grow at a faster rate. These observations support

other available evidence that Sri Lanka is moving away from

a low-income situation to one where, with the rise in per capita

income, the relative share of consumer expenditure on goodsto meet basic needs is declinins in favour of services of the

consumers' choice.Gross Domestic Capital Formation, or investment

expenditure, at current market prices was estimated at Rs.393billion, an increase of 16.3 per cent over the previous year. In

the previous yeat, the conesponding increase was 9.1 per cent.In real terms, capital formation increased by 17.0 per cent in

2003 rvhile the conesponding growth in the previous year was6.7 per cent. In the years 2001 and 2002, investment

expenditure was lower than in 2000. This level was exceededin 2003. The continuation of the ceasefire and the peace

process, steady expansion of economic activity and economicgrowth, donor support for the government's economic

programme, lower interest rates, and improved macroeconomic

management were the major reasons that led to the increase in

rnvestment.The recovery in investment expenditure was led by theprivate sector. Even though the overall investment ratio

dropped from22,0 per cent to 2l.3 per cent in2002, the private

investment ratio (private sector investment/GDP) continued to

grow in 2002 tiom 16.2per cent to 16.7 per cent, This ratioimproved further to 17.0 per cent in 2003. Private sector

investment was mainly concentrated in power generation,

telecommunications, transportation, and retail trading. On a

sectoral basis, investment in transport equipment recorded the

highest increase of 38 per cent. Investment in buildings and

other construction increased by l4 per cent, while that on plant

and machinery increased by l0 per cent. As most of these

investments occumed in the second half of the year, the impactwill be reflected in production in 2004 as well,

Government investment was estimated at Rs. 40.7 billion,an increase of 28 per cent over the level of 2002. ln 2002,government rnvestment declined by 25 per cent. The increasein public investment in 2003 was coupled with the curtailmentof government cunent expenditure. Government investmentmainly focused on road development, including the colombo- Matara highway project, r.egional development, andrehabilitation work in the Northern and the Eastem provinces.Regional development was centered on small-scale powerprolects, water supply and road construction.2.4 Availability and Utilisation ofResources

The total availability of resources in a country consists of GDp(domestic resources) and imports of goods and non-factorservices (foreign resources).

Private savings grew by 12.4 per cent. This growth camelargely from corporate sector savings in the context of higherprofitability and better performance. Household sector savingsgrew at a lower pace as the consumer cont-rdence that prevailedin2003led to higher spending and lower savings. Meanwhile,government dis-savings improved by 15,7 per cent.consequently, the domestic savings ratio (domestic savings/GDP), which was 14.5 per cent in2002, improved to 15.7 percent in 2003.Nationalsavings, the sum of domestic savings, net foreignprivate transfers and NFIA, also increas edby 2r.2per cent overthe previous year to Rs. 375 billion. The national savings ratio(national savings/GDP) rose by nearly one percentage point to21.3 per cent. NFIA although negative, improved, and helpedto maintain a higher growth of national savings compared withthe growth of domestic savings. Net private transfers, whichconsist mainly of workers' remittances, grew by l0.g per centin 2003, at arate lower than the growth registered in the pastfew years. one reason was the stable external value of the rupeeagainst the US dollar in 2003 that curtailed the growth ofworkers' remittances in rupee terms. Meanwhile, the growth indepartures for employment abroad also decelerated in 2003compared to previous years. Net foreign private transfers,which accounted for 34 per cent of national savings in2002,contributed 31 per cent in 2003.
