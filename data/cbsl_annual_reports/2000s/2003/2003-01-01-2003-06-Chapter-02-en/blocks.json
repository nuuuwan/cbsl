    "text": "in 2000 to22.0 per cent in 2001 .In2002, thou_eh the economygrew by 4.0 per cent, the investment ratio declined further to2L3 per cent, signifying the delay in investment decisions.Another factor that delayed new investment in 2002 was theexcess capacity that existed in most economic sectors. Thistrend reversed in 2003 and the investment ratio rose to 22.3 percent, confirming growing investor confidence, The turnaroundin investment was mostly observed in the second half of theyear as indicated by a sustained growth in private sector creditand a noticeable increase in the imports of investment goodsduring that period. However, the investment ratio is still belowthe level of 24 per cent initially projected for 2003 at thebe-tinning of the year. The under-performance of capitalformation was due to two major reasons. First, certain keyeconomic sectors (e.g. export manufacturing and tourism) stillperformed at below existing capacity so that there was noimmediate need for new investments in these sectors, Second,thou,eh the cessation of hostilities continued and a peacefulenvironment prevailed throughout the country, investorsadopted a 'wait and see' policy to make investment decisionsdue to uncertainties that prevailed in both the peace process andthe political environment. An investment level of 22.3 per centis not sufficient to achieve the long-term envisaged growth ofover 8 per cent that would be required for a sustainableimprovement in living standards. In the long-run, the speedyimplementation of power capacity expansion, labour marketand land market reforms, further dere,eulation to reduceadministrative bottlenecks, and further improvement in policyconsistency are crucial to convert increasing investorconfidence into real investment activity.On the resource side, domestic savings, the sum of privateand government savings, were estimated at Rs. 27J bjllion, anincrease of 20.9 per cent, in nominal terms. In 2002, thecorresponding increase was 3.3 per cent. As the increase indomestic savings exceeded that in GDP, the domestic savings/GDP ratio rose to 15.7 per cent in 2003 from 14.5 per cent in2002. Both the private sector and the government sectorcontributed to the improvement. Private savings increased by12.4 per cent, in nominal terms, while the private savings ratio,which was 18.8 per cent, improved to 19.0 per cent. Of theprivate savings, corporate sector savings increased due to betterperfbrmance during the period. However, household sectorsavings declined due to higher consumer e xpenditurethroughout the period. Government dis-savings, whichimproved marginally to 4.4 per cent of GDP in2002after risingdrastically during the previous two years, improved to 3.3 percent of GDP in 2003, due to continuation of prudent budgetarypolicies. The Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act, rhat waspassed in Parliament at end 2002 andstipulated a medium termflscal strategy for reduction of the budget deficit to 5 per centof GDP by 2006, impacted on the improvement in governmentdis-savings. The national savings ratio also increased from 19.5per cent to 21.3 per cent. The gap between domestic savingsand national savings widened in 2003, compared with 2002,",

    "text": "The Services sector grew by 7 .7 per cent contributing 70 percent of overall growth. The recovery in economic activity thatbegan from the second half of 2002 was driven by the growthof the Services sector. The Services sector had two advantagesover the other two sectors. First, the demand for serviceactivities such as trade, transport, tourism, financial services,port services and communication, increased at a higher rate, inthe context of growing consumer confidence with thecontinuation of the ceasefire, than the demand for goods.Second, the economy was able to cater to this growing demandwithin existing capacity.The faster growth of services sector and its continuouslyrising share in GDP in Sri Lanka are consistent with the usualdevelopment process of a country. The initial stages ofeconomic development require a firm structural foundation tobe laid by agriculture and industry. However, at the next stage,an efficient services sector is required to link production,distribution and consumption together, by lowering transactioncosts and improving efficiency, while raising the quality of lifeof people, by enhancing their choices and increasingconvenience. Hence, the dominance of the Services sectorusually moves in tandem with a country evolving from low-income to high-income. In particular, as Sri Lanka has a lownatural resource base, the magnitude and pace of futureeconomic growth will rely heavily on the Services sector, ashas been observed in the recent past.Value added in the Transport, storage and communicationsector increased by I0.2 per cent in2003, compared to 7.6 percent in 2002. This increase was largely due to the expansion inthe telecommunication subsector by 245 per cent. The FixedAccess-Wireless Local Loop subscriber levels grew by 1.3 percent, in comparison to a 3,8 per cent drop in 2002. The growthin the telecommunication sector was mainly driven by theupward trend in mobile phone usage that increased by 54 percent. A growth of 2l per cent in Internet and e-mail users wasrecorded. The growth in the telecommunication sector wasaugmented by the growing demand from the Northem and theEastern provinces for communication services, following theceasefire.The transport subsector, one of the largest service sectorsin the economy, grew by 3.8 per cent as against 3,6 per cent inthe previous year.

All sub-categoriescontributed to the recovery.The Manufacturing sector, the largest subsector inIndustry, grew by 4.4per cent in 2003. The growth in factoryindustry and small industry was mainly responsible for thisgrowth. The factory industry subsector, which covers theproduction of large and medium-scale industries, grew by 4.6per cent in 2003. This subsector contracted by 3.9 per cent in2001 and recovered partly in2002by 2.5 per cenr due ro thefavourable performance of domestic market orientedindustries. In 2003, domestic oriented industries continueo togrow in response to sustained consumer confidence. Thefood, beverages and tobacco category grew by 6.3 per cent,with the production of processed fbods growing by 7.3 percent and liquor by 12.0 per cent. The decline in the tobaccoindustry was 3.5 per cent. High rates of taxes on tobaccothreatened the industry, togerher with illegally importedcigarettes that were available in the market. Domestic marketoriented industries such as wood and wood products, plasticand PVC products, cement, basic metal products, andfabricated metal products also performed well during theperiod mainly due to the increased demand from constructionactivities. The export market oriented industries, whichcontracted severely in 2001, and recovered marginally in2002, grew at a modest rate of 2.6 per cent. The combinedgrowth of 2002 and 2003 was not sufficient to offset thecontraction experienced in 2001.

The competitiveness of Sri Lankan products thatwas maintained with aggressive cost cutting and an improvedreal effective exchange rate helped this growth. However, therecovery of the garment industry was slower than expected dueto the slower recovery of major importing countries such asUSA and Japan, continuing def'lationary pressures in someinternational markets and intense competition from low costmanufacturing countries, such as China and those in EastEurope. Of the export-oliented industries, rubber productsrecorded the highest groivth of 22 per cent. The demand forrubber based products such as rubber gloves and industrial tyresincreased, despite severe competition from China, as a resultof close relations with globalretailers, continuous improvementin quality and advanced marketing strategies. Under the IndoLanka Free Trade Agreement, domestic tyre manufacturersexplored the Indian market in 2003, for the first time.Small industries grew by 6.I per cent, compared with thegrowth of 2.1per cent in2002. The paddy milling industry, themost widespread small industry in the country, performed wellin 2003 due to the bumper paddy harvest. The bakery industryalso grew amidst the growing demand for prepared foods.Small industries such as timber mills, rock and metal products,and tiles, bricks, cement blocks and related products benefitedfrom the growth in the construction industry.The Electricity, water and gas sector grew by 2L7 per centin 2003, in contrast to the 0.7 per cent decrease in the previousyear. Electricity generation during the first half of the yearincreased by 17 .4 per cent on the low base in the conespondingperiod of last year where power cuts were imposed till mid May2002.In the second half of the year, generation rose by 6.9 percent, resulting in an annual increase of 11.7 per cent. Thedemand for electricity grew by 129 per cent during the year,mainly due to high growth in the industrial and commercialsectors. Hydropower generation by the CEB and private powerproducers increased by 22.9 per cent, while thermal powergeneration increased by 4.5 per cent. During the year a 163MW combined cycle thermalpower plant constructed by AES(Pvt.) Ltd and the 70 MW Kukule Ganga hydropower planrwere cornmissioned in February and September, respectively.Consequently, installed capacity expanded by l0 per cent andthe value addition in the electricity subsector increased by 25.3per cent due to higher generation of low cost hydropower,particularly in the second quarter, and lower usage of high costhired thermal power from the second quarter onwards. Duringthe year, 56.5 per cent of the total electricity was generatedthermally,'in comparison to 60.4 per cent in2002.Meanwhile,water distribution increased by 1.4 per cent compared with 3.8per cent in the previous year.",

Export earnings, however,dropped by 22.5 per cent relative to the 52 per cent growthrecorded in2002. Tobacco production declined by 3.5 per centmainly owing to the setback in the tobacco industry mentionedearlier. The animal husbandry subsector recorded a growth of1.8 per cent during the year. Poultry meat production grew by3.6 per cent during 2003 in compadson to the growth of 4.7 percent in 2002. Meanwhile, value added in milk productionincreased by 1.2 per cent, amidst the adverse etfects of highinput costs, parlicularly the price of cattle feed.According to primary data sources, fish production duringthe year declined by 5.5 per cent. This decline was thecombined outcome of the decline in output in the marine sectorby 6.8 per cent and an increase in output of inland fisheries by7.6per cent, leading to a decline in value addition by 6.9 percent for that sector. The drop in marine fish production isattributed to the depletion in the fleet of murtiday boats as wellas the loss of fishing days due to bad weather experienced inthe southern and Northwestern coastal areas during the monthsof May and June in2003. Fishing in the Northern territorialwaters was also apparently affected by poaching. The drop inoutput was reflected in the increase in fish prices by 7.4 percent, on average. While domestic a-ericulturalproduction in theNorth and the East has responded positively to the ceasefire,such positive developments are yet to be realised in thefisherres sector even after 2 years. One reason cited is thelimited refrigeration and other infrastructure facilities for thetransport of fish from these areas.",
