Chapter 9

TRADE, BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND TOURISM

9.1 Overall Developments

The external sector in 2003 gathered momentum from the

recovery seen in 2002.International trade expanded. Receiptsfrom services and worker remittances grew, reducing the

current account deficit, Increased inflows through the tinancial

and capital account more than offset the current account deficit

bringing about a substantial surplus in the balance of payments

(BOP) for the third consecutive year. Consequently, the foreign

reserves of the country rose further to a comfortable level. Theexternal competitiveness measured by the real effective

exchange rate (REER), improved, as did the terms of trade. The

external debt service ratio declined. As a whole, the foreign

exchange market further expanded and deepened, although

some volatility was experienced in this market towards the end

of the year owing to uncertain political developments. All thesedevelopments would serve to strengthen the country's

resilience to external shocks.The external sector responded positively to favourable

developments in both the global economy and the domestic

economy. The global economy grew at a rate of 3.9 per cent,

higher than the earlier expected growth rate of 3.2 per cent,while Sri Lanka's major export market, the US performed

better, growing at 3.1 per cent. The impact of the war in Iraq

was less severe than feaLed as it ended relatively quickly.

However, oil prices increased in 2003, in contrast to the earlier

expectations of a decline, following the Iraq war. The adverseimpact of high oil prices was partly offset by favourable

domestic weather conditions, which reduced the use of thermal

powef.

On the domestic fiont, the continuation of the ceasefire,improved macroeconomic management and accelerating

economic retorms contributed to laying a strong tbundation for

future economic growth, This led to the approval of the Poverty

Reduction and Growth Facility and the Extended Fund Facilrty(PRGF-EFF) by the IMF and enhanced assistance from theWorld Bank, ADB, Japan and other donors. These

developments too had positive eff'ects on the external sector.The PRGF-EFF facility made available IMF credit on more

concessional telms and conditions than the assistance under the

Stand-By An'angement (SBA) that was conrpleted in 2002. It

was also consideled an endorsement of the government's

medium-term economic policies. This endorsement helped to

obtain a larger amount of assistance f rom ol.her don<lrs as well.

Donols pledged assistance ol'US dollars 4.5 billion during thepeliod 2003-2006 at the donor conf'et'ence held in Tokyo in

June 2003.

The overall BOP recorded a surplus of US dollars 502

million in 2003, the highest such surplus since 1993. The majorcontributoly factors for this very high surplus were a faster

recovery in the tourism sector, continuous increase in port

activities, higher worker remittances and increased utilisation

of foreign aid by the government. In the sphere of trade, expotts

responded positively to favourable developments in the global

economy and recorded a growth rate of 9 per cent in US dollarterms, The recovery in exports was broad based, with

agricultural exports growing at 3 per cent and industrial exportsat I0 per cent. Within industrial exports, garment exports

recorded a 6.3 per cent growth, while other industrial exports

recorded an impressive growth of 16.2 per cent, reflecting a

move towards a beneficial diversification of Sri Lanka'sindustrial exports towards non-garment exports. Imports also

grew at 9 per cent in US dollar terms during the year. Consumer

goods imports grew by 12 per cent and investment goods by I3

per cent. The recovery in import of capital goods, particularlyduring the second half, is an indication of expanding

investment activity in the economy creating a conducive

environment for futule economic growth.

The services account recorded a significant improvement

during 2003 owing to a boost in tourist earnings and increased

earnings from transportation services. The tourism industry

benefited directly from the continuation of the cease-fire.

A drop in outflows relating to rental payments for hired power

due to a greater use of hydropower also contributed to this

improvement. Meanwhile, the deficit in the income account

contracted notably during the year owing to higher income

generated from official reserves. Cunent transfers continued to

record a steady growth of 9 per cent, due to increased worker

remittances. The improvements in the services, income and

transfer accounts offset the impact of a slightly largel trade

deticit, r'esulting in the cument account deticit contl'acting to US

dollals I0l million (0.6 peL cent of GDP) fLom US dollars 237million (1.4 per cent of GDP) 1n 2002.Meanwhile, capital intlows to the government through

loans, grants and ptivatisation ploceeds and the continuation offoreign direct investments (FDI) contributed to the

improvement in the capital and financial account. The resultant

overall surplus led to the building of official tbreign leserves

equivalent to 4.2 months of imports at end 2003, from 3.3

months of import cover at end 2002. The total gross external

assets of the country, i.e., official reserves plus foreign assets

owned by commercial banks, were sutficient to finance 5.8

against the euro, the pound sterling, yen and SDR. The largerdepreciation against other currencies and the deceleration ofdomestic inflation improved sri Lanka's exter nalcompetitiveness measured in terms of two REER indices,namely, a 5-currency REER and a 24-currency REER, by2.8 per cent and 3.4 per cent, respectively. Debt service ratiosdeclined reflecting improved capacity of the country to serviceexternal debt due to higher foreign exchange earnings.9.2 Exports

The export sector recovered in 2003, continuing the growthmomentum that began in late 2002 atter one and a half yearsof contraction experienced prior to that. Exports in US dollarterms increased by 9 per cent in 2003 in contrast to a declineof 2 pel cent in 2002. Export earnings amounted to us dollars5,133 million in 2003, compared with us dollars 4,699 millionin 2002.lndustrial exports, dominated by garment exports,made a significant contribution of 80 per cent to thislmprovement. Agricultural exports also contributed to thisgrowth due to favourable tea and'ubber prices. The globaleconomlc recovery strengthened the market for sri Lankanproducts, particularly garments, machinery, mechanical andelect'ical equipment, rubber based products, diamonds,crustaceans and molluscs, fish products and plastics. of the

three majol export categories, the value of agriculturar expoltsin US dollars grew by 3 per cent and industrial exportsincreased by l0 per cent, while mineral exports declined by7 per cent.

The unit value index of exports rose by 5.5 per cent, whilethe export volume index increased by 3.5 per cent. Exportvolume grew by 6.8 per cent and 10,2 per cent during the firstand second quarters of 2003, respectively, but declined by2.8 per cent during the third quarter and increased by 1.8 percent during the fourth quarter of 2003. The slower growthperformance during the second half was due to reduced growthin gems, petroleum products and a few other industrialproducts, which had grown substantially in the second half of2002. Prices remained favourable throughout the year. Thehigher unit value paltly reflects changes in product.composition, which shified to relatively more expensive andhigher quality products. International prices of many industrialproducts exported by Sri Lanka remained at higher levels thanin the previous year'. The volume of industrial and agricurturarexpofts increased by 3, I per cent and 5.5 per cent, respectively,offsetting the impact of the decline in the volume of mineralexports (-2 per cent). With a decline in import prices by 1.8 percent, the terms of trade improved by 7.4 per cent in 2003compared with 4.6 per cenr in 2002.

Export Structure

Since liberalisation in 1977, the share of industrial exports

expanded continuously and had become the major contributorto exports, overtaking the share of plantation agricultural

commodities in 1986. The share of industrial exports increasedgradually from 14 per cent in l9l1 to77 per cent in 2003. Thisratio has remained above 75 per cent during the last 6 years.

The share of other exports, including mineral exports, declinedfrom 7 per cent in 1977 to 4 per cent in 2003. Textiles andgarments, which have provided the largest contribution toindustrial exports since 1986, contributed 65 per cent ofindustrial exports in 2003,

Industrial Exports

Earnings from industrial exports increased by l0 per cent in

2003 compared to a decline of 2 per cent in 2002. Textiles and.

garments contributed 50 per cent to the total export earnings in

2003. The other major categodes were machinery, mechanical

and electrical equipment (6 per cent), diamonds and jewellery

and rubber based products (4.5 per cent) each, food, beverages

and tobacco (3 per cent), leather products and footwear and

petroleum products (l per cent each) and miscellaneous items

totalling 7 per cent.

The major contribution to the increase in industrial exports

came from higher exports of textiles and garments, in response

to increased demand tiom industrial countl'ies. Earnings fromtextile and garment exports increased by 6.3 per cent to

US dollars 2,576 million in 2003, continuing the increasing

trend since October 2002. The volume and unit price of textiles

and garment exports increased by 3 per cent each during 2003.USA and the European Union (EU) continued to be

major export destinations for Sri Lanka's textiles and garment

exports accounting for 93 per cent of all garment exports in

2003. Garment exports to USA and the EU increased by 4 per

cent and 12 per cent, respectively, as demand rose in thesetwo economies. Although EU had removed quota restrictions

on textiles and garments imported from Sri Lanka from I

Janualy 2001, Sri Lanka was not able to achieve the expected

gains in 2001 and 2002, as markets were depressed in the EU.However, in 2003, Sri Lanka was able to benefit from quota

free access to EU markets by supplying high quality and high

value garments. As garments were also among products thatreceived additional benefits under the Special Incentive

Arrangement (SIA) of EU under the Generalised System ofPreference (GSP) effective from I February 2004, thrsupward trend is expected to continue in 2004. Exports to

Canada, which were under quota restrictions, increased by 2

per cent in 2003. The relative share of garment exports to

other quota free countries increased from 4 per cent in2002

to 5 per cent in 2003. Including the EU, the share of garments

exported to non quota countries increased from 35 per cent in

2002 to 37 per cent in 2003, reflecting continued reduction in

dependence on quota, albeit at a slower rate.

Of the subcategories in the textiles and garment sector,

garment exports increased by 7 per cent, while textile expofis

increased by 4 per cent. Export of yarn and other made up

articles declined by l0 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively. In

2003, more than 94 per cent of textile and garment expol'ts

came from BOI enterprises, Export earnings of BOI enterprises

increased by 8 cent compared to a decrease of 3 per cent in

2002. Exports by non-BOI enterprises, which are mainly by

small scale exporters, declined further by l6 per cent in 2003

compared to an l8 per cent decline in2002, demonstrating thedifficulties of competing in a market where cost and quality

factors determined sales. Net foreign exchange earnings from

the textile and garment sector increased by 9 per cent in 2003.As prices of textile imports remained at the previous year's

level this increase ref-lects a move towalds higher value addedproducts in the garment industry, which was anticipated.Industrial exports, excluding textiles and garments, grewby 16.2 per cent in 2003, compared to 3 pel cent in 2002.Among these, exports of machinery and mechanical andelectrical equipment increased by 9 per cent. Earnings fromrubber based product exports increased by 27 per cent,

compared to 6 per cent in 2002. The growth was mainly rnexport of tyres and gloves. Tyres, i.e. re-treaded, newpneumatic, solid and cushion, accounted for 52 per cent oftotal rubber based product exports and increased by 42 per

cent in 2003, Industrial and surgical gloves accounted for 3l

per cent of rubber based product exports and grew by l8 per

cent. Othel major rubber based product exports that increasedduring the year included appaLel and clothing accessories,floor coverings and mats, pharmaceutical products, plates,

sheets and strips and inner tubes.The export of diamonds and jewellery increased by 14 per

cent in 2003, compared to an increase of 1l pel cent in2002.

Diamond exports increased by l3 per cent in 2003 respondingto high demand trom major trading centres such as Belgium,

Israel, Vietnam, USA and Japan. The jewellery market, which

sutfered due to the sluggish economic situation in Japan, USA

and the European markets in2002, recovered steadily and grew

by 26 per cent in 2003. During the year, jewellery producersbenefited from the exemption from VAT granted to rawmaterials such as gold, silver, diamonds, pearls and gem

imports after August2002. The demand for diamonds and gems

in the local market too remained high due to the growth in thetourist industry. Germany was the largest buyer of jewelleryfrom Sri Lanka (20 per cent) followed by UAE, Japan,

Switzerland, Singapore and UK.Export earnings from food, beverages and tobacco

increased by l8 per cent in 2003 compared to the decline of4 per cent in 2002. This was attributable to higher earningsfrom crustaceans and molluscs, and fresh and frozen fish,

which increased by 20 per cent and l8 per cent, r'espectively,

However, prices of these products in international markets werelower than in the previous year. The low returns on shrimp

exports has acted as a disincentive to the expansion of farming.

The Ministry of Fisheries and Ocean Resources has beenclosely monitoring the quality and standalds of farms againsta set of required quality and standards determined under theFisheries and Aquatic Resources Act as a precautionarymeasure to control diseases. Legal action was initiated againstfarms that had violated these regulations. Demand for theseproducts in USA, Japan and France and some Asian countriesincluding Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea and Thailandremained high.The European Council approved eight fish processingplants in 2003 to export fish products to EU countries, Theconstruction of a fish canning and smoking factory at theMutuwal Fishery Harbour commenced in December 2003. Thisproject targets both export and local markets and is expectedto commence production in August 2004. Among other fbodexports, fruit and vegetable juices, manufactured tobacco,coconut milk powder, coconut cream, malted milk. sweetbiscuits and mineral water exports increased in 2003.Earnings fiom the export of petroleum products declinedby I I per cent as naptha produced by the Ceylon petroleumCorporation was fully utilised domestically by the combinedcycle power plant fol power generation. However, the exportvalue of bunkering and aviation fuel increased by 9 per centwith improvements in port and aviation services and higher unitprices. Export earnings from all other major categoriesincluding, plastics, ceramic products, chemical products,footwear and other leather products, articles of wood, toys,articles of copper, quartz, coconut by products etc., increasedduring the year.

Agricultural Exports

The three plantation crops contributed 84 per cent toagricultural exports in 2003 - teaJl per cent, coconut 9 percent and rubber 4 per cent. Other agricultural exports, whichare dominated by cinnamon, cloves and un-manufacturedtobacco, contributed the remaining l6 per cent, Exporteamings from agricultural products increased by 3 per.cent,largely due to the increase in plantation crop exports.

Plantation Crops

Earnings from tea, amounting to US dollars 683 million,increased by 4 per cent in 2003. Tea exports suffered due ro theIraq war, but recovered in May and June due to large volumesof tea being exported to Middle Easteln countries fbllowing theend of the war. This recovery continued, resulting in an I I percent growth during the latter half of 2003. However, the annualincrease was marginal. Tea export prices, which were lowerthan in 2002 until May 2003, recovered gradually thereafter,resulting in an averago price of US dollars 2.2g per kg in 2003

as against US dollars 2.26 per kgin 2002.Of total tea exports, 59 per cent were in bulk fbrm, and33 per cent in packed form. The remaining 8 per cent was intea bags and higher value added fbr-ms such as domestic tea

blended with foreign teas and instant and green teas. Russia

continued to be the single largest buyer with a share of l9 per

cent in 2003. The Russian government raised the minimumimport duty on value added black/green tea from euro 0.40 toeuro 0.80 per kg with effect from l1 March 2003.

Simultaneously, they raised the minimum declared value of tea

sharply by 100 -200 per cent, Tea exports to Russia in bulkform, which is not subject to tariff revision, increased by 397metric tons to 32,762 metric tons in 2003. Teas in value addedforms too increased by I ,94J metric tons to 25,344 metric tons

accounting tor 44 per cent of total tea exports to Russia. Withthis tariff revision, Sri Lanka will find it difficult to competewith Russia's local value added tea producers. However,Russia's effort to popularise value added tea may create a

demand for bulk tea exports.Syria overtook the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and

became the second largest buyer of tea with a share of l0 per

cent. This was partly because tea was channelled through Syriato Iraq and other Arab countries during the war period. UAE

accounted for 9 per cent. Other major buyers were Libya (7 per

cent), Turkey (6 per cent), h'an (5 per cent) Jordan and SaudiArabia (4 per cent) each. As a group, Middle East countriesbought 43 per cent of total tea exports, while CIS countries

bought 25 per cent and EU bought 10 per cent in 2003.

Earnings from the three major coconut products, namely,

desiccated coconut, copra and coconut oil, increased by l6 per

cent in 2003 compared with an increase of I per cent in 2002.

The increase was a result of significant increases in the export

volumes of desiccated coconut and copra, which came from the

increased coconut crop and lower domestic demand fiom thecoconut oil industry. That demand was lower as edible oilimports increased afier the special surcharge on import duties

was removed in September 2002. The exported volumes of

these products increased by 48 per cent and 32 per cent,respectively, while their prices declined by 22 per cent and1l per cent, respectively. Coconut oil exports however,

dechned by 4 per cent in 2003. This is evidence of the adverseimpact of ad hoc changes in tariff policy, which create

distortions in the market. With the higher harvest of fresh nuts,coconut product exports, other than the three major products,

too increased by 6 per cent in 2003. Export earnings from coirfibre mattresses and coir yarn grew significantly. A long-term

clear tariff policy is critical to developing the coconut product

export industry on a more sustainable basis.Export earnings from rubber increased by 44 per cent toUS dollars 39 million in 2003, which accounts for less thanI per cent of total exports earnings. Rubber prices continued to

increase since July 2002 following international market trends.The average rubber export price increased by 50 per cent in

2003 over 2002. The volume of exports declined by L4 million

kg to 35.3 million kg in 2003. Lower export volumes were dueto high local consumption in industry. Rubber production

increased from 90.5 million kg in 2002 to 92 million kg rn

2003, while local consumption of rubber increased from 54

million kg to 56 million kg in 2003, as the rubber based

manufacturing sub-sector expanded during 2003. To meet theinput requirements of the local industrial sector, 9.2 metric tonsof natural rubber were imported in 2003 compared with 4.9metric tons in 2002

Other Agricultural Exports

Export earnings from other agricultural exports, known asminor agricultural exports, declined by l0 per cent toUS dollars 150 million in 2003 from US dollars 168 million in2002. Three major crops in this category, vie., cinnamon,unmanufactured tobacco and pepper, accounted tbr 63 per centof total other agricultural product exports in 2003. Earningsfrom cinnamon exports increased marginally. Despite price

increases, exports of unmanufactured tobacco declined due to

increased demand in the local industry. The quantity of pepper

exported declined by 2 per cent, while pepper prices declinedby l5 per cent because of increased global production.

Furthermore, Indian pepper producers lobbied against pepper

imports from Sri Lanka as Sri Lanka has enjoyed a 100 per centtariff concession under the Indo-Sri Lanka Free TradeAgreement (ISLFTA) since March 2003. This protest may havenegative impacts on Sri Lanka's exports, depending on the

outcome of lobbying. Earnings from cloves, which became asignificant commodity among other agricultural products in

2002, declined by 79 per cent (US dollars 23 million) in 2003.

Both prices and the volume of clove imports to India from SriLanka declined since the quality f'ell below expected levels.Demand fbr nutmeg and mace remained steady throughout the

year. Cardamom prices declined, but export volumes increasedsubstantially to satisfy demand fLom India. All these spicesreceived duty free access to the Indian market after March

2003.Increased prices for exports of vegetables resulted in a

higher export value, despite lower quantities. Export earningsfrom dry and fresh fruits, betel leaves and coftee increased,while earnings from essential oils, arecanuts, cashew nuts andcocoa products declined in 2003.

Mineral Products

Earnings from mineral exports declined by 7 per cent in 2003mainly due to a decline in gem exports, which account for94 per cent of mineral expoils. Gem exports were affected byunresolved issues in the gemstone trade, especially the

controversy over artificial quality improvements to sapphiles

in Thailand. Buyers had questioned whether SriLanka too usedchemicals in the heat treatment process and this caused an

adverse impact on the gem trade during the early part of theyear. However, this problem was resolved in favour of SriLanka. SriLankan heat treated gemstones regained the market

towards the end of 2003. The high standards maintained by Sri

Lanka will improve SriLanka's competitiveness over Thailandin heat treated gemstones.Sri Lanka continued to be the largest supplier of topquality large blue sapphires of natural colour to the world

market and the prices of these products were stable during the

year. The demand for calibrated blue, pink and yellowsapphires in the European and US markets remained stablethroughout the year, usA continued to be the largest buyer ofSriLankan gems in 2003. Italy, Switzerland, UK, Germany andFrance were among the major buyers in the European market.Hong Kong maintained its position as the centre fbr fine gemsand jewellery in the Asia-pacific region. Japan and Thailandcontinued to be major markets for Sri Lankan gems in thisregion. Gem sales were higher in the local market with therevival of the tourist industry since the Iatter part of 2002. onthe supply side, f'loods and earth slips in May and June 2003adversely affected gem mining, but supply recovered graduallythereafter. The National Gem and Jewellery Authoritycompleted scientific surveys and auctioned new Iands formining in Balangoda, wellawaya and Matara, which increasedthe supply of raw gems towards the end of 2003. Earnings fiomother mineral exports grew by 2 per cent, reflecting higherearnings from ilmenite exports.9.3 Imports

Imports grew by 9 per cent to US dollars 6,6i2million in 2003compared to 2 per cent in 2002 reflecting the economicrecovery and the reduction of the import surcharge from 40 percent [o 20 per cent. Demand for intelmediate goods increased

due to the recovery in exports and domestic market orientedindustrial activity, while demand for investment and non-fbodconsumer goods increased reflecting improved investor andconsumer confidence. Food imports increased only marginally,as lower imports of rice, wheat and sugar, offset the increasesin milk food and other food items. The import volume indexincreased by I I per cent, while the unit price index declined by2 per cent in 2003, high petroleum prices notwithstanding.

Import Structure

There has been a gradual shift from consumer goods tointelmediate and investment goods impo'ts since economiciibeLalisation in l9ll. Expansion in the industrial sectorrequired higher imports of intermediate goods, whileinfrastructure development and construction activities,expanslon rn transport sectors and increased use of advancedtechnology increased imports of investment goods. Further, anincrease in the domestic supply of rice and other food itemsreduced the need fbr fbod imports. When compared with2002,the relative importance of intermediate and investment goodsincreased marginally from 76 per cent to 77 per cent, whileconsumer goods remained at 22 per cent. The share of otherimpo'ts (including det'ence related imports) decreased from2 per cent to 1 per cent in 2003.

Consumer Goods

The import of consumer goods increased by 12 per cent in 2003

though fbod and drink imports increased by I per cent over

2002. This marginal growth was largely attributable to highimports in December 2003 (40 per cent increase over

December 2002), partly reflecting the impact of anticipatedupward revisions of tariffs and Value Added Tax (VAT) in

Budget 2004. Slower growth in food imports was attributed todeclines in rice, wheat and sugar imports, which offset the

impact of higher imports of milk products and other food items.

The largest food item, wheat grain imports, declined to

918,700 metric tons in 2003 compared to 993,200 metric tonsin2002. Wheat imports in2002 were unusually high as thisincluded delayed wheat shipments from 2001 and wheat

imported for building up domestic stocks. Sri Lanka imported

more than 80 per cent of its total wheat requirement from India

in 2003. This share was 57 per cent in2002. The Indian export

credit line of US dollar 3l million made available to SriLankafor wheat imports was the major reason for this change. Sri

Lanka had already used US dollars 7.4 million in 2003. Wheatflour imports declined from 11,325 metric tons in2002 to 9,705million in 2003.Rice imports declined from 95,100 metric tons in 2002to 34,580 metric tons in 2003, due to the record domestic

paddy production in 2003. Despite lower import prices, sugarimpoils declined by 44,600 metdc tons to 509,300 metric tonsin 2003. Despite higher prices, imports of milk productsincreased by 3 per cent in volume terms. Fish imports

increased marginally, utilising the duty free facility granted in

September 2002. Despite higher import duties, imports of big

onions, potatoes, chillies, garlic and fruit increased to satisfy

higheL demand as well as to compensate for lower domesticproduction than in 2002.Imports of all major categories of consumer durablesincreased significantly, reflecting the impact of increased

consumer confidence and income. Imports of motor cars and

motor cycles increased by 67 per cent in 2003, while the import

of rubber tyres and tubes rose by l0 per cent. Imports of radio

receivers and television sets increased by 18 per cent, whilemedical and pharmaceutical imports increased marginally.

Other consumer durable imports, which increased in 2003,were ceramic and glass tableware, electrical kitchenware,clothing, footwear, toys and skin care products.

Intermediate Goods

Intermediate goods imports increased by 9 per cent in value

terms in 2003. Textile imports, the largest item, accounted fbr

36 per cent of intermediate goods imports in 2003. The volumeof textile imports increased by 4 per cent reflecting higherderived demand trom garment exports. The expenditure ontextile imports increased by 4 per cent, entirely due to higher

volume.

The second largest item, crude oil and refined petroleum

products, accounted for22 per cent of total intermediate goods

and rose by 6 per cent in 2003. The volume of crude oil importsdeclined from 16.8 million barrels in 2002 to 14.7 million

barrels in 2003. The average price of crude oil increased byl7 per cent from US dollars 25.13 per barrel in 2002 toUS dollars 29.46 per barrel. The value of refined petroleumproduct imports increased by I I per cent due to increasedprices (18 per cent) although the quantity imported was less

than in 2002. The lower volume of petroleum imports was dueto reduced demand for thermal power generation with

increased hydropower generation.The value of diamond imports, the third largest

intermediate import item, increased by 22 per cent, reflecting

the improvement in exports. Expendtture on fertiliser imports

increased by 16 per cent entirely due to high prices as the

quantity declined by 4 per cent. Although the fertiliser subsidy

scheme was continued, increased domestic prices may have

reduced the demand for fertiliser in 2003, Other intermediate

goods imports increased by l5 per cent, mainly due to higherimports of inputs for paper, chemicals, garments, jewellery,

bakery and rubber based manufacturing industries.

Investment Goods

Imports of investment goods increased by l3 per cent in 2003,

The import of transport equipment rose by 37 per cent, withhigh volumes of imports of parts and accessories for lorries,

Direction of Trade

Industrialised countries are the main destination for sri Lankanexports following the economic liberalisation in Igll.However, the share of these countries has been declinrnggradually from 76 pel cent in 1995 to 70 per cent in 2003.similarly, as origin of imports, the share of industrialcountriesdeclined from 37 to 3l per cent during the same period, Tradewith Asian countries expanded. The share of developingcountries as export destinations increased from22 pel cent in1995 to 25 per cent in 2003. The share of Eastern Europeancountries increased from2 per cent to 4 per cent. The share ofdeveloping countries as the origin of Sri Lanka's imports,increased from 64 per cent in 1995 to 68 per cent in 2003,USA has been the single largest buyer of Sri Lanka'sexports since 1979. However, its mar-ket share declined fr.oma peak of 4l per cent in 2001 to 38 per cent in 2002 and,35 percent in 2003. Textile and garment exports accounted for 83 percent of total exports to USA in 2003. The market share of UK,the second largest buyer, remained unchanged at l3 per cent.Shares of garments and tea in exports to UK accounted for77 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively. The Indo-Sri LankaFree Trade Agreement (ISLFTA) helped increase tlade withIndia. In 2003, the third year after the commencement of theAgreement, India bought 5 per cent of Sri Lanka's total exports.Exports to Germany, Belgium and Luxembour-g accounted for5 per cent each and to Japan fbr 3 per cent. Major exports toGermany were garments and tea, while diamonds and garmentswere the main exports to Belgium and Luxembourg. Othermajor items exported to Western countries were preciousstones, gloves, tyres, coconut by-products, prawns and fishproducts and statuettes and ornamental articles. Japan remainedone of SriLanka's major markets fbr fiozen shrimp, machineryparts and accessories, tea, fish products and precious stones.Western industrial countries as a group continued to be SriLanka's largest export trading partner in 2003.Once again, India was the lar-gest source of imports (16 percent), followed by China and Hong Kong (13 per cent),Singapore (8 per cent) and Japan (7 per cent). Imports fromIndia increased by 26 per cent in 2003. Petroleum products,wheat, cotton yarn and fabrics, food products including sugar,onions, chillies, lentils, edible products etc., iron and steel,vehicles, pharmaceutical products and machinery were themajor items impolted from Indra. Imports from China andHong Kong increased by l8 per cent, while those fromSingapore increased by 2l per cent. Fabric and accessories forthe garment industry were the major items imported from

source of imports and its share has been increasing at a fasterrate since the implementation of the flee trade agreementbetween the two countries, Sri Lanka's trade with Pakistanincreased significantly over the previous year, though stillsmall in absolute terms (l per cent of total exports andimpolts each). EU accounted for 30 per cent of total exportsand l6 per cent of total imports in 2003. Exports to CIScountries accounted for 4 per cent of Sri Lanka's exports withhigher tea exports to Russia.

9.4 Services and Income

The services account registered a higher surplus for the thirdconsecutive year, registering a net inf'low of US dollars 396million, a 34 per cent increase over the previous year. Theimprovement in the services account was mainly broughtabout by higher receipts from travel and transportation

serv l ce s.Earnings from travel have two components; namely,earnings from tourism and receipts from non-resident SriLankans visiting Sri Lanka. The boom in tourist arrivalsresulted in tourist earnings rising by 30 per cent to US dollars324 million in 2003. Receipts fiom non-resident Sri Lankansvisiting Sri Lanka have been estimated at US dollars 100million during the year. Even though this inflow is expected tolevel off over the years, permanent peace could make this aregular inflow of foreign exchange as non-resident Sri Lankans

are hkely to visit the country more fiequently.

Net transportation services, which include passenger fares,freight services and port related earnings, increased by l0 per

cent to US dollars 201 million owing mainly to higher touristarrivals. Although activities relating to transshipment cargohandling increased during the year, foreign receipts increasedonly marginally due to more competitive prices offered forservices at the Colombo port,The IT sector recovered in 2003 from the setback in2002. The slowdown in the world economy in 2001 and2002

caused a major decline in overall IT spending the world over

as large global enterprises reduced purchases of IT products

and services, causing many IT solution suppliers worldwide'to sufter losses and decreases in overall growth. Sri Lanka'scomputer and information services sector, which was also

aff-ected by these global trends, had a significant recovery in2003. IT exports increased by 60 per cent to US dollars 80million in 2003 from US dollars 50 million in 2002. With theearnings per employee being significantly higher than thoseof other major foreign exchange earners, this is an area inwhich Sri Lanka has a considerable potential not only interms of earning foreign exchange, but also in attractingforeign direct investments as well as generating employmentopportunities. The government could support this sector by

adopting the required regulatoly environment, upgrading andmodernising infrastructure and assisting human resource

development, in terms of quantity as well as quality.

Net receipts from the telecommunications servicesdeclined by 26 per cent to US dollars 45 million during the

year. With the lrberalisation of the international gateway under

the new National Communications Policy, about 30 companiesapplied for ne w licences for using and providing services to

customers. The high competition has led to a significant fall inthe domestic price of intelnational calling charges raising thenumber of Sri Lankans calling the rest of the world.Meanwhile, the deficit from other business services declinedby l3 per cent to US dollars ll7 million. owing to loweroutflows on account of hired power-rentalpayments, as the useof thermal power was replaced with hydropower to some extentduring 2003 due to favourable domestic weather conditions.

The deficit in the income account contracted significantlyduring the year, mainly due to a significant increase in income

fi'om the country's international reserves, and helped to reducethe current account deticit. Both gross official reserves andinternational reserves of commercial banks increased for thethird consecutive year, while global interest rates remained atalmost the same level as in 2002. As a result, interest income

on international reserves increased during the year. In addition,efficient management of official reserves by the Central Bank

and movements in cross cuffency exchange rates and prices offoreign securities held by the Central Bank had a favourable

effect on fbreign exchange trading profits and foreign securitiestrading profits. Income genelated from official reserves

increased to US dollars 110 million trom US dollars 4l millionin 2002. This was sufficient to meet over 75 per cent of the

lnrerest payments on government external debt. outflows to theincome account, which comprised interest payments onexternal debt of the country and profits and dividends tonon-residents on foreign investments, increased by 2 per centto US dollars 336 million in 2003.9.5 Current Transfers

Net inflows to the transfers account continued to contribute inincreasing vorumes to offset the trade deficit. In 2003, thesurplus in the transfers account amounted to 9l per cent of thetrade deficit. This ratio was below 50 per cent prior to 1996 andbelow 70 per cent prior to 2000, except for r99g when the tradedeficit was exceptionally low.Total net cunent transfers, comprising net private transfersand net official transfers, increased by 9 per..nt to uS dollarsr,234 million- Net private transfers, which account for over98 per cent of total net transfers, were the main source of thermprovement. Sri Lankan migrant workers remitted uS dollarsr,414 million in 2003, an increase of l0 per cent over theprevlous year.

The improvement in 2003 is partly due to an increase inthe number of Sri Lankans migrating for foreign emproyment.Annual migrants increased by 3 per cent, to 20g,g0l in 2003.The Iraq war appears to have had littre adverse impact onforeign employment in the Middle East, as it ended earlier thanexpected. Due to the uncertainties that prevailed in the MiddleEast region prior to the war, workers are berieved to haveremitted more of their savings in advance as a precautionarymeasure. This is reflected in higher remittances during the firstfew months of 2003. The ongorng peace process wourd arsohave led to more funds being channelred through the formalbanking sector, particularly in the North and East, wherecommercialbanks were more active than in the past. It has beenreported that branches of commercial banks in the North andEast have been receiving increasrng amounts of remittancesduring the year.Worker remittances from the West Asian regionaccounted for 57 per cent of total private transfer receipts, Theshare of earnings from the west Asian region has beendecreasing from 2002, with the increase in employment inEurope, even though the number of migrant workirs to thewest Asian region increased. Eighteen per cent of total transferreceipts came from countries in the European Union. This sharehas gradually increased over the last four years, perhaps alsoreflecting the increasing number of migrants. North America,other European countries and the Far East continued to accountfor about 6 per cent, 8 per cent and 5 per cent of workerremittances, respectively.9.6 Capital Movements

Net inflows to the capital and financial account improvedduring the year, mainly due to larger capital inflows to thegovernment. The signing of the PRGF-EFF Agreement withthe IMF helped the govemment to receive rarger capital inflows

during the year. Although the IMF credit is not available to thegovernment budget, but is meant for supporting the Bop, theAgreement served as a catalyst for other receipts. other donorassistance, particularly new commitments from the worldBank, ADB and Japan, are linked to the progress in theimplementation of economic refbrms in the pRGF-EFF, aseach donor country's assistance strategy was based on thePoverty Reduction strategy paper (pRSp) associated with thePRGF-EFF. The donor conference held in Tokyo. in June 2003,endorsed the policies in the pRSp, and pledged assistanceamounring ro uS dollars 4.5 billion for rhe period 2003-2006.A portion of this new commitment was disbursed during 2003.A large part of the Tokyo commitment is available fbr theimplementation of economic reforms and for the developmentof infrastructure facilities for the whole country. A significantpart of assistance is committed to rehabilitation andreconstruction of the North and East. Therefore, reaping the fullbenefit of the donors' pledges would critically depend on theprogress in the implementation of economic reforms. as wellas progress in the peace process,

US dollars 556 million , a l7 pet cent increase over 2002. TheWorld Bank released a new programme loan of US dollars

127.5 million under the Poverty Reduction Support Credit

(PRSC) to support the government budget in implementing

economic reforms. In addition, the World Bank continued toprovide assistance to develop sectors such as health andeducation under previous commitments. The Asian

Development Bank also provided programme financing of

around US dollars 65 million to the budget and projectfinancing of around US doliars 150 million relating to

infrastructure development and rural financing during the year.

Japan's assistance exceeded US dollars 230 million' The 36th

Loan Package signed between the Japanese government and theSri Lankan government in March 2003 committed another

US dollars 280 million to implement five projects' A part of

this commitment was utilised during 2003.

However, the uncertainty that prevailed towards the end

of the year slowed down foreign assistance. For example, the

disbursement of the second tranche of the PRGF-EFF, expectedwithin the year was postponed. Other donors also adopted a'wait and see' approach in finalising their donor assistance

programme fbr 2004 as a larger part of assistance would depend

on the success of the PRGF-EFF alrangement with the IMF'

The committee appointed by the government to speed upforeign aid utilisation took several measures that helped

improve disbursements for project financing and shortened the

time taken to finalise loan agreements. However, more needs

to be done to speed up the process of project implementation.

The government announced at the Donors' Conference inTokyo that it would establish an institutional framework to

increase the capacity to utilise foreign aid at a faster rate. Major

donors have also pledged to provide assistance to develop the

necessary institutional framework.Higher utilisation of foreign assistance received on

concessional terms and conditions would also reduce the need

to obtain less concessional loans such as export credits and

commercial borrowings. In particular, although some available

export credit appears to be more concessional than commercial

borrowings in terms of interest rates and maturity, the actual

cost of these credits could sometimes even be higher than

commercial credits, as such credit can be used only to import

specific items produced in the donor country'

Principal repayments on the government's medium-term

loans declined to US dollars 359 million, tiom US dollars 380

million in 2002. The decrease in repayments was mainly dueto the lower repayment of defence related credit, which

amounted to US dollars 92 million in 2003 compared to

US dollars 144 million in 2002. As a result of higher

disbursements and lower repayments of foreign loans, the net

disbursements to the government increased to US dollars 548million from US dollars 162 million in 2002, making a

significant contribution to the overall surplus in 2003'In contrast, intlows of loan capital to the private sector

decreased to US dollars 102 million in 2003 from US dollars

115 million in 2002. Only a few private sector companies

engaged in new foreign borrowing during the year. The larger

part of disbursements related to existing commitments and

medium-term external credit obtained by BOI companies for

trade and investment related purposes. The lower external

private bonowings partly ref'lected the lower domestic interest

rates, which reduced the advantage of foreign borrowing.

It may also have retlected a continuation of the private sector's'wait and see' approach in making medium and long-term

investments, It also reflected some difticulties faced by the Sri

Lankan private sector in raising foreign capital. In the past, a

larger amount of private sector fbreign bonowings came under

government guarantees to entities pailly or fully owned by the

government, such as Air Lanka and Sri Lanka Telecom' With

the privatisation of these companies, the government has

moved gradually away from providing guarantees for toreign

loans by the private sector.The government has initiated measures to facilitate the

private sector to obtain foreign loans. First, the government is

negotiating with international rating agencies to obtain a

sovereign rating for the country. A sovereign rating, togetherwith the already available domestic ratings, would helpinternational investors to assess the creditworthiness and

establish risk premia for local tlrms more easily. Secondly, the

government has tabled a new Foreign Exchange Management

Act in Parliament, which would simplify the existing procedurefor foreign borrowings by the private sector and further

liberalise the restrictions on medium and long-term bonowingsby the p'ivate sector. the implementation of these twomeasures would enhance the private sector's ability to raisecapital from international markets on the merits of their ownbalance sheets- However, progress in the peace process andremoval of political uncertainty are two cr-ucial factors, whichwould encourage the private sector to make medium andlong-term investments. In addition, the International FinanceCorpo'ation (IFS), the commercial lending arm of the worldBank, has increased its activities with the private sector.Foreign Direct Investment

Inflows of foreign direct investment including privatisationproceeds increased to uS dollars 229 mrllion in 2003 fromUS dollars 197 million in 2002 mainly due to rargerprivatisation proceeds of uS dolrars 30 million in 20031 , Th.realised inward investment flowed mainly to sectors such aspower and energy, port related developments, telecommuni_cations and manufacturing. However, net FDI inflows weremarginally lower in 2003 owing to a larger- outflow ofuS dollars 27 million compared to the outf'low of US dollarsI I million in 2002. The larger outf-row was mainly due to theacquisition of a commercial bank in Bangladesh by a sriLankan commercial bank which invested US dollars 20 milhonfor the acquisition.FDI inflows in the medium term depend Iargely on thenumber of agreements signed between the BoI and foreignrnvestors. with the progress in the peace process, the numberof new agreements signed rncreased, as did the number ofinquiries and projects under negotiation. The estimated fbreigndirect investment fi'om new agreements signed durin_{ 2003 isabout uS dollars 430 million in comparison to thecorresponding figure of US dollars 160 million in 2002. Thisdevelopment indicates that the imprementation of these newprojects should bring significantly larger FDI inflows in thewith the political uncertainty in theivity slowed down and a t'ew larsehave been postponed.Privatisation prclceeds from fbreign sources were lowerthan expected during 2003 mainly due to the purchase of theSri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC) by a local entity, anddelays in the receipt of the ploceeds from the sale of 100 petrolstations and a common user facilities of Ceylon petroleumcorporation. The receipt of US dollars 30 million on accountof privatisation proceeds in 2003 rerated to the liber-alisation ofthe domestic petroleum sector under which the Indian oilcorporation entered the domestic market as second plaver inthe petroleum sector.

Short-Term CapitalPortfolio investment recorded a marginal net inflow ofUS dollars 2 miilion in 2003 compared to rhe inflow of USdollars 25 million in2002. The lower net inflow recorded wasmainly due to a large outflow of around us dollars 40 million,resulting from the strategic purchase of the controlling interestof a large hotel company by a local blue chip company tromits foreign investors. other than fbr this transaction, net inflowsto the colombo Stock Exchange were positive throu,uhout theyear, ref'lecting an improvement in fbreign investor confidence.Total purchases by foreigners amounted to US dollars 145million, while total sales were US dollars 143 million. Theincrease in the tottrl volume of transactions by for.eigners tous dollms 288 million in 2003 fiom uS dollars 140 million in2002 rcflects improved lbreign investo. interest in the shar.emarket. Private short-term credit, comprising shor.t-term exportand impo't related credit, recorded a lower net inl'low ofUS dollars l8 million.Net foreign assets of commercial banks improved byus dollars 96 million in 2003, from uS clollars 40 million in2002, despite the central Bank's purchase of us dollars 375million from commercial banks dur.ing the year. Thisrmprovement was mainly due to the repayment of uS dollars158.5 million of Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs), heldby commercial banks, sLDBs are treated as domestic assets,and their repayment by the government, and consequenttnvestment in fbreign assets by commercial banks, improvedthe NFA of comme'cial banks in the last two months o1'theyear. The expectation of a higher depreciation of the rupeeduring the Iatter part of the year also encouraged commercialbanks to continue to hold onto assets in foreign currency.Meanwhile, gross external liabilities of commer-cial banksremained almost unchanged during the year.9.7 External Assets

Reflecting the net results of above mentioned developments,the BoP reco'ded an overall su'plus of us doilar-s 502 millionin 2003. This was the third consecutive year that the Boprecorded a surplus, and was the second highest surplus everrecorded. The highest surplus (US dollars 661 million) wasresistered in 1993.

The surplus in the BOP led to a build up of the country's

net official reserves. The Central Bank's purchases of foreignexchange from commercial banks, which amounted toUS dollars 375 million on a net basis during the year, helped

boost the reserves. The absorption of excess foreign exchangeliquidity by the Bank also helped to stabilise the exchange rate,particularly during the third qual'ter. Cash disbursements ofconcessional loans and commercial borrowing by thegovernment amounted to US dollars 532 million. These

receipts served to help the servicing of a large part of foreignpublic debt and SLDBs. In addition, the management of the

international reserves portfolio by the Central Bank also addedaround another US dollars 110 million in terms of interest

income, trading profits and valuation gains.

9.8 Foreign Exchange MarketDevelopments

In international foreign exchange markets, the US dollar

continued to weaken against other major currencies for the

second consecutive year. Despite the recent recovery in the

US economy, concerns about the escalating twin deficits in the

US, namely, the cun'ent account and fiscal deficits, weakened

the US dollar against other major currencies. The United States

appeared to have been moving away from a strong dollar

policy, while the Bank of Japan reduced intervention to weaken

the yen. All these developments contributed to the depreciationof the US dollar against the Japanese yen (10.8 per cent), the

sterling pound (11.0 per cent) and the euro (19.9 per cent) in

Nominal and Real Effective Exchange Rates

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report _ 2003201

Part IChapter I - TRADE, BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND TOURISM

Box 16

Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)

Bxchange Rates

An exchange rate can be expre ssed either in terms of the

national currency value of a unit of tbreign culrency (price

quotation system) or foreign currency value ot'a unit of the

national currency (volume quotation system). While it is

customary to express the exchange rate in the former, the

latter is a more appropriate indicator to assess the extent of

appteciation and depreciation o1'the national currencyl. For

example, the annual average exchange rate of the lupee

against the US dollar moved flom Rs. 95.66 in 2002 to

Rs,96.52 in 2003, and hence the US dollar value of the

rupee dropped from 1.05 US cents to 1.04 US cents per

rupee during this period. Accordingly, the a\rerage nominal

exchange rate (NER) of the rupee against the US dollar

depreciated by I per cent in 2003, in nominal terms.

Two other widely used indicators to measure exchange

rate changes are the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate(NEER) and Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER). The

NEER is a lveighted average of major bilateral nonrinal

exchange riltes, with rveights based on the trade shares

reflecting the relative importance of each currency in the

effective exchange rate basket.2 The REER is obtained by

adjusting the NEER for inflation differentials with the

counl.ries lvhose cun'encies are included in the basket. As

the inflation rate in each country is assumed to broadly

indicate the tlends in domestic costs of production, the

REER is expected to reflect foreign competitiveness of

domestic products.However, one cannot solely rely on the REERindiciitor to gauge the variations in competitiveness, as it

does not adequately capture the impact of a host of other

factors such as the changes in macro-economic policies,

changes in the trade and exchange system including the

changes in the regulatory and institutional environment andproductivity changes. In addition, there could be data

dellsiencies, particularly in the price indicators.

Nevertheless etfective exchange rate indicators arewidely used to assess competitiveness. The main focus ofthe NEER and the REER is on the trade balance,particularly the exchange rate induced changes in trade

t'lows. A trend appreciation of the real ettective exchange

rate is considered unfavourable tbr the growth of export and

import competing i ndustr-ies.

Publication of lndices

The Central Bank has, for many years, computed severalNEER and REER indices fol its own internal policy

purposes, the details o1'which were nol made available to

the public, in the past. As Sri Lanka has moved to irnindependently floating exchange rate regime, and

consequently, bilatelirl exchan-{e rates being detetmined by

the market, it is feit the publishing these indices w'ould

provide usefuI inlblmation to the mzrrket.

Rather than concentrating on the movements of the

exchange rate a-eainst one foreign cutrency only, this would

enarble market pat'ticipants to track [he movement of the Sri

Lanka rupee against an average basket of currencies. In

pu'ticular, the movements in the REER, which takes into

account both the e fl'ect of cross culrency movements and

the difference in inflation rates, ivould provide someinformation on the Sri Lanka's international competi-

tl veness.In addition to providing the NEER and REER indices,

the computational methods, the cun'encies in the basket andthe trade rveights used in the computations are also

published. This r.l,ould enable interested parties to carry outtheir own analyses. The indicss will be updated on a

monthly basis in the lltule.

Calculation, Sources and Methodology

trading partner countries are computed on a regular basis by

the Central Bank.

trading partners and competitor countries depreciated by 5'9per cent during the same period. Meanwhile, the REER

against the 5-currency basket depreciated by 2.8 per cent,

while against the 24-cunency basket, it depreciated by 3.4 per

cent during the same period. This indicates that the SriLanka's external competitiveness, in terms of the REER

indices, has improved further.

Domestic Foreign Exchange Market

The domestic foreign exchange market continued to expand

and deepen in 2003, both in terms of volume of transactions

and in terms of the duration of forward transactions. The total

volume of forward market transactions rose by a8 per cent to

US dollars 1,401 million during the year, and was about 38 per

cent of the total transactions in the interbank market during the

year. The average monthly volume of forward transactions

increased to US dollars I l7 million in 2003, compared toUS dollars 79 million in 2002. An increase in forward

transactions with longer maturity periods was also evident,

indicating improved market confidence. Forward premia were

below interest rate differentials throughout the year except for

a few days when the rate was highly volatile.Activities in the forward market indicate the growth inthe foreign exchange market. In 2003, activities grew

considerably, particularly during the first l0 months of the

year, when the exchange rate was relatively stable and even

appreciating against the US dollar. Forward transactions have

become a popular instrument among Sri Lankan exporters to

hedge against foreign exchange risk. When there was an

appreciating trend in the rupee, exporters started selling their

export proceeds in the forward market, as evidenced by the

increase in volume during the period of appreciation' This

also led to a drop in the forward plemia to around 4 per cent,well below the interest rate differential of around 7 per cent

between the rupee and the US dollar. However, when there

was an expectation of depreciation at a higher rate during the

last two months of the year, volumes of forward transactions

dropped significantly. This was partly due to the tact that Sri

Lankan importers are less used to hedging foreign exchangerisk, and entering into forward transactions than exporters.With the expectation of a higher depreciation, importers tendto increase the demand for foreign exchange in the spot

market rather than entering into fbrward agreements' This notonly exerts further pressure on the exchange rate to

depreciate, but also increases the cost of imports as importers

need rupee funds in advance to purchase foreign exchange

from the spot market. Hence, there appears to be a need to

encourage importers to use forward instruments, which would

both reduce the volatility in the foreign exchange market and

reduce import costs. The higher volatility in the exchange rateduring the Iatter part of the year in response to politicaluncertainty highlights the fact that the domestic foreign

exchange market needs to be further deepened to minimise

excess volatility.

9.9 External Debt

As a percentage of GDP, the total external debt of the country

increased to 58.4 per cent in 2003 from 56.3 per cent in2002.

However, in US dollar terms, the total external debt of the

country increased by 14 per cent to US dollars 10,644 million

at end 2003. The increase in government debt, including IMFliabilities, by US dollars 1,293 million (15 per cent) to

US dollars 10,025 million contributed to the increase in total

external debt, It has been estimated that more than 50 per cent

of the increase in total external debt in US dollars is due to the

sharp depreciation of the US dollar against major cunencies,

as approximately 43 per cent and 3l per cent of the debt are

denominated in SDR and yen, respectively. Medium and

long-term debt, accounting fbr 94 per cent of the total external

debt, mainly consisted of concessional debt of the government

(85 per cent). The balance non-concessional stock largely

represented medium and long-term private sector debt as the

government's non-concessional stock is relatively small. In

US dollar terms, the govemment's non-concessional debt stock

remained almost unchanged at US dollars 219 million due to

the repayment of outstanding defence credit of US dollars 90million and the receipt of US dollars 100 million through a

commercial loan raised from international tinancial markets.

There is a continuing need to limit non-concessional external

debt to maintain the external debt sustainability of the country'Higher utilisation of loans received on concessional terms

could meet the tinancing needs of the government at a lower

cost in a more sustainable mannet.Meanwhile, the total private sector debt, including short-

term debt, declined by 2 per cent to US dollars 1,553 million

during the year. Government guaranteed externaldebt to public

corporations and private sector declined by l3 per cent to

US dollars 599 million, as government refrained fromproviding guarantees to the private sector. Private sector

external debt without government guarantees increased toUS dollars 335 million in 2003, consisting largely of

medium-term trade cLedit,Short-term external debt increased to US dollars 619million (5 per cent of GDP) from US dollars 601 million in

2002. Short-term debt consists only of trade related credit.

Liabilities to the IMF increased by US dollars 80 million during

the year on account of disbursements related to PRGF-EFF

programme. Meanwhile, banking sector external liabilities

increased by US dollars 45 million to US dollars 1,046 million'

mainly due to a larger stock of ACU liabilities at the end 2003'

As a result of the above developments, total external debt

and other liabilities, which includes banking sector external

liabilities too increased to 64.1 per cent of GDP in 2003 from

62.4 per cent in 2002. However, in US dollar terms, the stock

increased by l3 per cent to US dollars 11,689 million.

9.10 Debt Service Payments

Debt service ratios, which compare totaldebt service payments

against foreign exchange earnings of the country, reflect that

the country's capacity to service external debt has improvedfurther in 2003. These ratios indicate that the country has

continued to improve the aftordability of servicing external

debt due to higher foreign exchange earnings and lower debt

service payments in US dollar terms. Debt service payments as

a percentage of receipt fiom merchandise exports and services,

declined to ll,6 per cent in 2003 from 13.2 per cent in2002'

As a percentage of receipt from goods, services, income and

private transfers, debt service payments decreased to 10.8 per

cent in 2003 tiom 9,3 per cent in 2002. The declining trend in

debt service ratios is an indication of both an improvement in

the country's external sector vulnerability and the sustainability

of external debt,Total debt service payments, which include both

amortisation and interest payments on all external debt,

decreased by 4 per cent to US dollars 757 million during 2003-

However, amortisation payments, which account for 70 per

cent of total debt service payments, decreased by 8 per cent to

US dollars 527 million, mainly due to lower repayments of

government's defence related credit. The increase in interest

payments by 6 per cent to US dollars 229 mrllion is mainly

due to two reasons. First, although global interest rates

remained almost at the same levels, large disbursements of

government medium and long-term loans increased the debt

stock and thereby interest payments thereon. A higher debt

stock does not necessalily increase amortisation payments in

the short-term as most of the government's external loans

carry a grace period for lepayments of principal, but increases

interest payments, Secondly, the sharp depreciation of the USdollar during the year increased debt service payments

measured in US dollars terms.

9.1L External Trade Environment andPolicy

The external trade and tariff policy under the market orientedpolicy framework has been aimed at achieving a riberar,competitive less protective tariff regime characterised by alow and simplified tariff structure. However, the policydirection was intenupted with the introduction of a number oftariff bands in November 2002 repracing the two-band tariffsystem of l0 and25 per cent, which had been in effect sinceFebruary 2000. A large number of duty fr.ee items (1,663items) were brought under a new band of 2 per cent, whileanother 59 items were brought under- a 20 per cent band.Some selected machinery and equipment (g20 items) weremaintained under the 5 per cent rate of tariff while r,260rtems were maintained at 25 per cent. A few items such asbeer and tobacco are at a higher rate of 75, while somecigarettes are under a rate of 100 per cent. Meanwhile, 3litems including some varieties of tobacco and footwear aresubject to either ad valorem or specific duties, whichever ishigher. Another 46 items including major agriculturarproducts, are still subject to specitic duties. The permanentTariff Advisory councir, which was set-up in 2002 toexamine and correct anomalies and distortions in the tariffstfucture, and to address representations, made by importersand industrialists, continued its work in 2003.Tariffs and Taxes on External TradeExcept for revisions made to import duty on a f'ew selecteditems, no major change was made to the tariff structure in 2003.Minor changes were made to the tariff structure four timesduring the year. The import surcharge of 20 per cent wasextended until 3l December 2003. Imports of onions andchillies were added to the list of exemptions applicable toimport duty surcharge. Distortions by way of duiy waivers,exemptions and introduction of surcharges were maintained ata minimum level in line with the present poricy direction.The specific duty on rice was raised from Rs.5 per ks toRs,7 per kg on 05 March 2003 and then increased to Rs.9"perkg on 2l August 2003. specific duty on bicycres and tricycreswas rncreased f}om Rs.500 per unit to Rs.750 per unit on05 March 2003. Duty rates on a few serected items such asfruits, perfumes, beauty or makeup preparations, selectedplastic items, liides and leather products, plywood and otherpanels, carpets, parts and accessories for 'ehicles and somemachinery and equipment were revised fiom 2r August 2003.with eff'ect from 4 september 2003, the 2 per cent tariffband was revised upwards to 2.5 per cent, while the specificduty of Rs.6 per kg on big onions, preserved and dried onionsand Rs.3.50 per kg on sugar were rarsed to Rs.g per kg andRs.3,75 per kg, respectively. The imporr dury on iiquoi *or;revised uplard fr-om 9 September 2003.The revenue fbrgone due to duty ivaivers on import w.slimited to Rs.163 million in 2003 as againsr Rs.9,034 miilionrn2002. The removalof duty waivers granted on petroleum and

some food products in 2003 was the major cause of the lowerrevenue loss. Duty waivers were glanted only on donations tocharitable institutions, religious institutions, diplomaticmissions and goods imported fbr development projects in termsof the agreement signed by the government with donoragencles.with the full year effect of the upward revisions made tothe tariff structure in March and November 2002, the averageimport duty, i,e., the 'atio of import duty collection to totaladjusted imports, increased from 4.g per cent in2002to 5,3 percent in 2003. The average import duty rate, without the impactof the 20 per cenr surcharge was 4.6 per cent as against +. i percent in 2002. The increase in the average duty rate was mainly

due to the impact of replacing items under the zero band by a2 per cent tariff in November 2002 and revisions made

thereafter. Consequently, the share of dutiable imports in total

imports increased from 28 per cent in2002 to 37 per cent in

2003, expanding the tariff base.Dutiable imports within the consumer goods category

increased from 61 per cent in 2002 to 67 per cent due to the

imposition of duty on previously some duty free items. Theaverage impoLt duty rate on food and drink increased

marginally as high specific duties were effective on major food

items to protect local producers. The average import duty rate

on non-food consumer goods categories increased to l3 per

cent in 2003 from 12 per cent in 2002.In the intermediate goods category, the share of dutiable

imports increased from l0 per cent to l8 per cent, while in the

investment goods category, the share increased from 45 per

cent to 62 per cent in 2003. However, the average duty rate on

intermediate goods lemained at the 2002level as a large part

of the intelmediate imports are still duty free. The average duty

rate on investment goods increased from 5,5 per cent Io7,2per

cent as a large share of investment goods are now under the taxnet and liable for both import duty and surcharge. This also

reflects the impact of expensive transport equipment imported

during the year.

Import and Export Controls

In 2003 several amendments were made to the Imports and

Exports (Control) Act, No.l of 1969 (as amended by Act,No.48 of 1985 and Act, No,28 of 1987) with numerous

objectives. In order to minimise administrative delays andsimplify procedures, the involvement of the Controller of

Exchange was removed from the import of goods with a value

exceeding US dollars 1,000 as a gift or without any foreign

exchange payment requirement, in February 2003. Similarly,

the Ministry of Defence was exempted from the requirement ofobtaining import control licences for importations done in

respect of state security services in March 2003, Giving moreflexibility to importers to finalise their transactions, the time

penod given to importers between the date of advance payment

and goods receipt was increased from 30 days to 90 days in

December 2003.To avoid illegal transactions in the diamond trade, allimports of rough diamonds are required to be certified as

having been handled in accordance with the provisions of theKimberley Process Certificate Scheme, which certifies theauthenticity of such trading activity since June 2003. All

exports of rough diamonds should also be accompanied by acertificate issued by the National Gems and Jewellery

Authority to ensure that the consignment was processed using

diamonds imported in accordance with the provisions of this

scheme.To protect the environment, a licence fee was imposed on

the c.i.f. value of imports when import licences are issued for

used vehicle seats (20 per cent), used furniture and cut portions

of motor vehicles (50 per cent each), used refrigerators, deep

freezers and air conditioners for personal use (5 per cent each)

and in commercial quantity (10 per cent each) in August 2003.

Furthermore, special purpose vehicles and agricultural and

construction machinery older than l0 years were brought under

a licensing requirement from October 2003. Some machinery

parts were removed from the licensing requirement in June2003 to further libelalise such imports. With these

amendments, the total numbel of items under import controls

at 6 digit level of Harmonised System of Codes (HS Code)

increased by 63 items to 376 items by end 2003,

About 30 categories of expotts, i.e., wood and articles of

wood (ebony), ivory and ivory products and passenger motor

vehicles (first registered in Sri Lanka prior to 1945) and several

mineral products such as waste and scrap of copper, nickel,

aluminium, lead, zinc, tin, tungstern, molybdenum, tantalum

and magnesium, continued to remain under licence with the

objectives of environmental protection and preservation of

antiques. Except quartz, iron and non-alloy and steel products,

the entire export sector has continued to be ft'ee from all export

and ad valorem sales taxes since end 1992, However, export

cesses are applied on tea, coconut and coconut products,

cashew nuts in shells, raw hides and non-f'enous scrap metal.

A nominal fee or royalty is levied on conch shells, coral chanks,

elephants and tuskers.The number of items on the list of exemptions has

remained unchanged at 22 since 6 November 2002. TheDirector General of Customs has to be satisfied that those

goods are imported for the purpose approved under the

respective categories and that approval has been obtained fiom

the Secretary to the Treasury. The Iist of concessions consistingof l3 items with a concessionary duty rate of 2 per cent and

2 items with 50 per cent of normal duty remained unchanged

since 6 November 2002. However, the concessionary rate of

2 per cent was increased to 2.5 per cent on 4 September 2003.A Ports and Airports Development Levy (PAL) of I per

cent of the c.i.f. value of imports was introduced with effect

from 1 May 2002.Imports for processing and re-export subjectto PAL at 0.75 per cent of the c.i.f. value of imports, was

reduced to 0.5 per cent from I January 2003.

The Agreement on Customs Valuation was implemented

in Sri Lanka in January 20$t. The Agreement aims at a fair,

uniform and neutral system for the valuation of goods, whichconforms to commercial realities and it will replace any

arbitrary or fictitious customs valuation procedures.

Textile and Garment Quota Allocation

During 2003, the Textile Quota Board (TQB) changed its quota

allocation, surrendering and transf'ening procedures to make

the system more flexible, cost effective and less tedious in

documentation. The TQB has introduced a new quota transfer

revived. Since January 2003, the requirement to register the subcontracts with TQB has been removed.

The overall quota utilisation rate in 2003 decrined to65 per cent, compared to 70 per cent in 2002. However, thevolume of exports under quota increased by z per cent duringthe year, The utilisation of quota varied widely across diff'erentproduct categories and countries. The utilisation of theus quota dropped from 7l per cent in2002 to 67 per cent in2003, despite the higher demand fLom USA fbr Sri Lankangarments. The under-utilisation was partly due to insufficientdemand for particular items, pref'erence of local producers touse their capacity to produce high value added garments underother quota categories or to produce non-quota garments. Thiswas evident in the increased exports of non-quota garmentcategories and full utilisation of some popular categories.Utilisation ratios for certain popular categories like dresses,trousers, underwear, knit shirts and blouses remained above 90per cent.As in previous years, the utilisation r.ate of quotasubmitted by canada was lower than that by USA, The over.allutilisation rate of canadian quota decrined marginally fiom 33per cent in2002 to 32 per cent in 2003. The only category thatwas utilised over 90 per cent was trousers, overalls and shorts.Incentives to Exporters

In 2003, government initiated several incentive schemes forexporters, which were proposed in the Budget 2003, whilecontinuing with the existing incentives in the form of taxexemptions, duty free imports of raw materials and duty and taxconcessions, These existing schemes include bondedwarehouse facilities for imported capital and intermediategoods, and the refund of duties and other fiscal levies onimported inputs used in the manufacture of exports. Taxholidays are also available to export trading houses exceeding

an annual turnover of US dollar 25 miilion fbr 5 years whiletrading houses with turnover exceeding a minimum level ofUS dollars 5 million are eligible fbr concessionary rates of5-10 per cent. other, sector-specitic tax incentives, are alsoavailable, including a tax holiday of 5-10 years for large scaleinfrastructure and agricultural undertakings, 3 yearconcessionary tax holidays for IT and IT enabling services e/c.subject to minimum investment requirements. As proposed byBudget 2003, industries with investment of Rs,l5 million andengaged in manufacturing and exporting more than g0 per centof their products, including non traditional expor.ts, weregranted tax holidays of 3 years for those in the wesrernProvince (Region I) and 5 years fb'other provinces (Region II).Direct financial assistance is limited to small scale andselected industlies. The sri Lanka Export Development Board(SLEDB) provided flnancial assrstance to expo'ters on a costsharing basis for their own initiatives to promote sri Lankanproducts in overseas markets. A scheme was inh'oduced to helphandloom exporters to modernise, improve productivity andbecome competitive in the international market. A rebatescheme for exporters of frozen chicken, meat and eggs was alsointroduced in 2003. The estimated cost of these programmeswas around Rs.30 million for 2003.

Institutional Support to Exporters

Several institutions continued to support exporters in a varietyof ways, e.g., product development, market access, marketing,insurance facilitation and credit. They extended their supportwith a range of products to cater to different steps in the expor-tprocess, The SLEDB continues to improve ploductionactivities in Export Processing companies (Epcs). which bringtogether the private sector (export trading houses), the statesector and village producers of exportabre products. under thisprogramme, 9 projects involving nearly 5,700 producers are inpfogress.As proposed in Budget 2003, the Tea Association of SriLanka was fbrmed with private sector participation to take overregulatory activities of the tea industly thus far can-ied out bythe government. A main objective of the Association was thedevelopment of 'ceylon standalds' for tea so as to differentiateSri Lankan tea flom other teas. With the objective ofdeveloping the image of sri Lanka as the fbremost p'oductioncentre for sapphires, Ceylon Sapphire Councjl Ltd. (CSCL)was fbrmed in 2003. cscl- entered into an alliance with aworld renowned jewellery desrgner to promote ,Ceylon

Sapphire Brand Strategy' targerting the high end of the market.The SLEDB made arrangements for 333 exporrers toparticipate in 54 trade fairs worldwide and seven inward andoutward missions were organised during the year,To promote marketing, SLEDB inaugurated the SriLanka centre in chennai, India in 2003, with the objective ofacquiring benefits arising from enhanced concessionsavailable under the Indo Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement.The centre is expected to promote a selected range of

products targeting the middle and upper segments of the

Indian market to further promote marketing and investment.In 2003, BOI has successfully undertaken several incentiveprogrammes. They led high level outward investmentpromotion missions to China, Malaysia, Germany, France,

India, Japan, Thailand and Bahrain, A number of high levelinward business delegations from India, Thailand, China,

Singapore and the UK also visited Sri Lanka.

Several measures were taken by SLEDB to combat thethreat posed by the ending of the MFA in 2004 and in

plojecting Sri Lanka's image in the apparel sector. Training and

production balancing programmes were organised. Two marketpromotion programmes in USA and EU were carried out

targetting reputed buyers of branded products.Insurance facilities to exporters were promoted by

SLECIC. SLECIC also provided a wide range of other tacilities

to exporters covering guarantees to banks and other financial

institutions, guarantees to overseas buyers, refinance to lending

institutions fbr loans granted for expanding exports, SLECIC

has taken steps to minimise its risk exposure by way of

reinsurance tiom a reputed firm to covet its liabilities. This has

enhanced its risk taking capacity. It will also enable expandingits scope and coverage to wider areas of business activities.

Despite the expansion of activities in its traditional areas of

businesses, SLECIC offered new schemes to provide services

to financing institutions. Its scope of business too has widened

to cover new areas such as issuing status reports of foreign

buyers, direct flnance facilities at the post shipment stage and

provision of guaranties to financial institutions that offer pre-

departure loans to repatriate workers.ln view of the long-term sustainability of the timberindustry and environment protection, a Forest StewardshipCouncil Certif ication Scheme (FSC) was initiated by the

SLEDB in 2003. FSC certification ensures that raw materials

used for timber products are obtained from well managed

forests.Maintaining quality and standards is essential to be

competitive in the international market. Sri Lanka StandardsInstitution (SLSI) issues quality certificates for agricultural

products against the relevant Sri Lanka standards. Pre-export

inspections for products like cashew, spices etc. were canied

out on a voluntary basis. Nineteen fishery product processing

establishments for export purposes were regularly inspected

and monitored by SLSL SLSI also provides advisory servicesfor exporters on international standards and technical

regulations.In older to facilitate and advice on the expansion ofexisting enterprises and to resolve operational issues, an'lnvestor Relation Unit' was set up at the BOI. SLEDB too

continued to provide information and advisory services on

international developments, benefits under various tax andtaliff reductions and trade agreement erc. while they have

successfully launched E-commerce services with a wide rangeof services to the business community.

The Exporters' Forum was expanded to include trade and

investment issues. The Forum brings exporters, importers and

investors together with relevant Ministers and relevant officialsfrom government and other institutions to resolve theirdifficulties and pr-oblems through direct interaction.

Freight Rates

During 2003, the average fieight rates for many destinations in

respect of diff'erent commodities showed mixed changes. Thebasic freight rates to majol destinations, i.e., USA and

European countries, showed increases despite the removal of

the war risk surcharge. The general fLeight rates to UK, NorthContinent (Germany, France, Austria, Denmark and the

Netherlands), Scandinavian, Baltic. Meditenanean Ports, USA,

Canadian and Mexican ports increased during the year. The

observed rates to UK, North Continent, Scandinavian, Baltic

and Mediterranean ports fluctuated within a range of US dollars

525-750 per TEU (twenty foot equivalent unit). The general

rates to the US East Coast region varied within US dollars

3,000 per TEU and US dollars 4,000 per FEU (forty foot

equivalent unit) while to the US Pacific Coast (West Coast) the

rates were around US dollars 2,000 per TEU and US dollars

2,775 per FEU. However rates varied within a wide range with

respect to major exports. The average tieight rates to USA fbr

garments, tea, rubber, rubber gloves, terry towels and travel

bags increased, whereas rates on solid rubber tyres and a f'ew

other items declined. The freight rates for tea to the Red Sea,Arabian Gulf and Japan decreased as the high war risk

surcharge was removed by end of 2002. Freight lates to theNorth Continent increased for cotton yarn, rubber, rubber

gloves, tea, brooms and brushes, while rates for garments, soft

toys and solid rubber tyres dect'eased.

Freight rates were inclusive of one or more of surcharges,

such as terminal handling charge, bunker adjustment factor,

Suez Canal transit f'ee, export bill of lading fee and peak season

surcharge. The Cargo Declaration Data Charge (CDDC) camein to effect subsequent to the security initiatives taken by theUS government as a result of September 11. The

US government introduced the US Customs 24 hour Advance

Manifest Rule. In the event of non conformity with the rule, a

penalty of US dollar 25 per bill is charged.

9.12 Trade Relations, Trading andClearing Arrangements

Sri Lanka took several steps in 2003 to strengthen regional,

bilateral and multilateral relations ensuring consistency with

the World Trade Organisation (WTO),

In 2003, Sri Lanka made a series of new commitments to

the WTO under the General Agreement on Trade in Services(GATS) on banking and insurance services, communications,tourism and travel related services. Those commitmentsportrayed the existing liberalisation stance of the country.

A few amendments based on TRIPs were also introduced to Sri

Since 1948, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GA fT) had plovided the r:ules for rhe international rLudingsystem. GATT refolmed itself into the World TradeOlganisation (WTO), a fully fledged inter-nationalorganisation, on I January 1995. A notable f'eature of theWTO is that there shou!d be consensus among themembership of the WTO before any agreement is madeoperational,The fundamental pLincipies of the WTO arenon-discliminati0n, reduced trade :barriers, policypredrcrability, transparency, competitiveness and ipeciattreatment for less developed countries. Many believe thatl'ree trade as advocated by the WTO wiil be n.l'it allcountries, especially small countries which do not have asubstantial domestic market. Hence, failur-e to agree ontrade promoting liberalisation measur-es hurt all countries,and in particuial smail developing countries like Sri Lanklr.The Mrnisterial Conierence is the WTO,s hishestdecision-making body. The Ministerial Conference lias tobe held at le iut once evcry two years. Since the creation ofWTO in 1995, there have been five MinisterialConl'erences, Sin*qapore (December 1996), Genela (Mty1998), Seattle (November-Decernber l9g9), Doha(November' 2001) and Canciin (Seprember 2003).At the flrst MinisteliulCont'erence in Sineapore, a fleivissues were brought into discussion clthcr than tr adeliberalisation. Those issues, known as 'Singapol.e IssLles',are trade related investment issues, trade relatedcompetition policy, trade facilitation and trunsparency insovernment procurement. i At the second Confer.ence heldin Geneva, ministers underlined the crucial importance ol'the multilatelal rule-based trading system, and reaffirmedlhe commitments and assessments made al Singapore.The third Minisrerial Cont'erence held in Seatrle endedwithout success, mainly as a result of the failure to agr.ee onnew issues and due to differences between the United Stateso1'Anrerica (USA) and rhe European Union (EU) onaglicultural subsidies, The founh Conference, in Doha.took place in the aftermath oI the September I I attack onthe USA. The outcome, populally known as the DohaDevelopment Agenda (DDA), was t0 uphold the principlcsof the WTO and to commence negotiations on all issuesreducing trade-distorting farm subsidies, slashing tarifls onfarm goods, eliminating agricultural expot.t subsidies,reducing tariff\ on textiles and freeing up trade in serviccs.

Trade policy reviews at regular intelyals are mandated inthe agreements of the World Trade Organisation (WTO),In those reviews, trade and related policies of membercountlies are examined and evaluated at regular intervalsvis-d-vis their commitments made to the WTO on thedegree of tlade libelalisation, For each review, twodocuments are prepaled: a policy statement by thegovernment of the member countfy under revielv arnd adetailed rcport written independently by the WTOSecretarrat. These two documents are discussed by theTrade Policy Review Body of the WTO at a Plenarl,

Session.The frequency of each country's revierv r,'ariesaccording to its share of world trade. The four memberswith the largest share of' world trade (currently, theEuropean Community, the United States, Japan andCanada) are reviewed every two years, the next l6 largestcountries every four yeals, and the rest every six 1,ears,Lon.ger periods are fixed for least-developed countrymembers. Sri Lanka, being a developing country, isreviewed once every six years. The first such review tookplace in 1995. The second was scheduled fbr 2001, but wascompleted in March 2004.The fbllowing is a summix'y of the second trade policyreview of Sri Lanka as completed in 2004,1. The govemment has made considerable efforts to pressahead with the rcconstruction and rehabilitationprosramme outiined in the policy document 'Reglining

and eliminate foreign equity restrictions in financial

scrvices, and has made efforts to liberalrse thetelecommunications market.6, Sli Lanka's heavy dependence on I few export marketsand products, such as textiles and clothing, remtrins asenous c0ncern.7. There are indications that Sri Lanka's tariff legime hasless predictability and transparency. Some suchindications are the high level of applied Most FavouredNation (MFN) tariffs, particularly for agriculturalproductsl the low percentage of bound l'ates; the largegap betrveen bound and applied ratesl high taLiff

escralation and consequently high eff'ective protectiongranted to some productsl existence of othel impoltcharges (notably the surcharge and the Ports andAirports Development Levy), import restrictions onmeat products, import pLohibitions on geneticallymodilied products, standards and contingency

measures, licensing requilements for economic reasons

and duty exenrptions.8. Govemment proculement procedures in Sri Lanka havedemonstlated price pleferences for loclllymanufactuled products and local rvork contracts, whileit suffers from opacity of tendering procedures,However, Sri Lanka is committed to leformins theprocurement system.

The revielv mechanism provides an opportunity tbr acountry to examine its own policies against WTO consistentpolicies. It also provides an excellent opportunity for amember country to scrutinise anothel member's traderegime and to bling to the notice of a]l WTO members anytrade discouraging and discriminatory measures. Thisscrutiny can be done and fnvourable changes to the membercountry's tfade regimes could be suggested by bringingtogether all forces <lf a country such as PermanentReplesentatives in Geneva, televirnt government agencies,

the private sector and their afflliated bodies. The existenceof a calendal of reviervs of WTO members helps a countryin prepaling fbL such scrutiny to help widen its access tomarkets in WTO member countries and to leap the fullbenefits of being a member of the multilateral trading

Under the ISLFTA, theIndian government made 2,rgg tariff rines duty free for SriLanka from l8 March 2003. wirh this revision, 4,150 tarifflines (81 per cent of total rariff lines) in the Indian tariffschedule are free from duty fbr exports originating fiom SriLanka. India agreed to include three additional entry ports fbrgarments shipped from sri Lanka, while agreeing to provideboth sea and airport access for entry points granteJ for tea andreadymade garments in previous negotiations. Furthermore,India agreed to deepen the present tariff concessions on textiles,Arrangement will be made by India to issue visas for sriLankan businessmen without the requirement of a personalinterview and based on letters issued by business chambers orthe Government of sri Lanka.

Part Ichapter 9 - TRADE, BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND TOURISM

The third round of negotiations under the Bangkok

Agreement, which was aimed at offering a maximum 50 per

cent margin of preference on existing tariffs in respect of

agreed items, was concluded at the twenty first session of theStanding Committee of the Bangkok Agreement held in

February 2004 in Thailand. Sn Lanka also exchanged offer listswith Bangladesh, China and South Korea. Both India and Sri

Lanka have decided not to exchange concessions in view of theexisting SLFTA between the two countries. Work on the

amended version of the Bangkok Agreement, called theAsia-Pacific Trade Agreement, has progressed satisfactorily

except for one outstanding issue with regard to domestic value

addition criterion in respect of products not wholly produced

or obtained.Sri Lanka assumed the chairmanship of the Indian Ocean

Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC) fbr theperiod of 2003-2005 at the fourth IOR-ARC Council of

Ministers held in Colombo in October 2003. At the council

meeting, consensus was reached on the future direction of

IOR-ARC with the adoption of the report by a high-level task

force. The next IOR-ARC ministerial meeting is scheduled to

be held in Sri Lanka in2004. The major focus of IOR-ARC is

on regional cooperation with special emphasis on economic,

trade and investment. Ongoing regional cooperation projects ofspecial interest to Sri Lanka include tourism promotion,

fisheries and shipping.Sri Lanka became a member of the Asia Co-operationDialogue (ACD) at the second ministerial meeting held in

Thailand in June 2003. As agreed at the flrst meeting of ACD

members, the Asian Bond Fund was created on 2 June 2003.

The aim of the Asian Bond Fund was to encourage the creationof an Asian Bond market, through concurrent development of

both the demand and supply sides, so that Asian countries will

both be issuing Asian bonds and investing in Asian bonds. The

Asian Bond Fund is US dollar denominated and open for bothUS and European investments through the Bank for

International Settlements. The first lot of Asian Bonds (ABF t)

was launched in June 2003 with the participation of 11 member

countries that have agreed to join the fund, with a starting

capital of one billion US dollars.Sli Lanka continued to receive tariff concessions fromdeveloping countries under the Global System of Trade

Preferences (GSTP) and from the European Commission by

participating in the Generalised System of Pref'erences (GSP)'

The European Commission has decided to grant additional

benefits to Sli Lanka under GSP because of its remarkable

progress towards compliance with the core labour standards asdefined by the ILO, Sri Lanka would benefit from this

arrangement with effect from I January 2004, which will

remain effective till 3l December 2005.

The Asian Clearing Union (ACU) has performed well in

2003, The total value of transactions of Sri Lanka effectedthrough the ACU mechanism increased by 29 per cent to

US dollars 1,039 million in 2003, compared with 2002 due

mainly to the increase of petroleum and wheat imports from

India and petroleum from the Islamic Republic of Iran. The

total receipts of funds in respect of exports from Sri Lanka to

other ACU countries recorded an increase of ll.6 per cent in

2003. The rupee value of net settlements made under the ACU

mechanism during the year 2003 amounted Rs.89,7 billion,

recording an increase of 33 per cent over 2002. Legislation on

anti-dumping, countervailing and safeguard measures that

aimed at protecting the domestic industry fiom unfair trade

practices, subsidised imports and import surges, was submitted

for Cabinet approval in 2003. The ptoposed enactment on anti-

dumping, countervailing and saf-eguard legislation in Sri Lanka

constitutes legitimate WTO sanctioned multilateral traderemedies designed to promote and safeguard the domesticindustry of the WTO member countries from unfair trading,

causing or threatening to cause 'serious injury' to the domestic

industry.

9.13 Internal Trade and InstitutionalArrangements

Government presence in trading activities has diminishedgradually over the last several years. Consequently, majorcontrols and intervention were limited to trade regulations,while state intervention on price determination was limited to

a few essential items. Benefitting from the economic recovery

and the opening up of trade opportunities in the North and the

East, internal trade further improved in 2003. The internal trade

sector, which accounts for l0 per cent of GDP, grew by 4.2pet

cent in 2003 compared with a3.2 per cent growth in2002.

Meanwhile, government intervention in commercial activities

was fulther curtailed in 2003 and was limited to the supply of

essential items through a f'ew state sector institutions.Activities of the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment

This is the highest number of touristarrivals in Sri Lanka so far, Tourist arrivals increased by 27.3per cent in 2003. Benefits of the ceasefire and peacenegotiations were felt strongly in the tourism sector. Recoveryof the global economy, especially Western Europe, alsocontributed to higher anivals. Gross earnings from the touristindustry increased by 39 per cent in 2003, from US dollars 248million in2002 to US dollars 324 million in 2003. The SriLanka Tourist Board (SLTB) expects to achieve a target of650,000 tourists arrivals in2004. This will exhaust existingroom capacity and other infrastructure facilities, particularlyduring peak seasons. In December 2003, room occupancy ratesincreased to77 per cent in the Colombo City, 64per cent in theancient cities and the southern coast, Insufficient flightfrequency and seating capacity too became major constraintsfor the expansion in the tourist industry.To increase accommodation, SLTB identified severallocations to develop tourist resorts. Under the 'South WestCoast Tourism and Community Infrastructure DevelopmentProject' funded by the Japan Bank for InternationalCooperation (JBIC) eight zones in the south west coast wereselected to develop infrastructure facilities. Two thousand acresof marshy land with inland water bodies in the Dedduwa andMarawila area were identified to be developed as a major eco- tourism site. A BOI project aiming at converting old mansionsand state bungalows for tourist accommodation is in place.As there are seasonal variations in tourist arrivals,promotional campaigns have been carried out by the SLTB andprivate tour organisers to promote Asian tourists to utiliseexisting capacity during off-peak seasons. The main targetmarkets are India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Thailand, Malaysiaand China, Sri Lanka was identified as an official destinationby China in 2002 and the private sector responded positivelyby initiating promotional campaigns in 2003. This gives accessto a large and fast growing market. Tourist arrivals fi'om Chinaincreased from 4,338 in 2002 to J ,251 in 2003, a 67 per centlncrease.To ease the constraint of flying fi'equency, SrilankanAirlines increased the number of flight destinations and
