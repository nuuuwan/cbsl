However, net FDI inflows weremarginally lower in 2003 owing to a larger- outflow ofuS dollars 27 million compared to the outf'low of US dollarsI I million in 2002. The larger outf-row was mainly due to theacquisition of a commercial bank in Bangladesh by a sriLankan commercial bank which invested US dollars 20 milhonfor the acquisition.FDI inflows in the medium term depend Iargely on thenumber of agreements signed between the BoI and foreignrnvestors. with the progress in the peace process, the numberof new agreements signed rncreased, as did the number ofinquiries and projects under negotiation. The estimated fbreigndirect investment fi'om new agreements signed durin_{ 2003 isabout uS dollars 430 million in comparison to thecorresponding figure of US dollars 160 million in 2002. Thisdevelopment indicates that the imprementation of these newprojects should bring significantly larger FDI inflows in thewith the political uncertainty in theivity slowed down and a t'ew larsehave been postponed.Privatisation prclceeds from fbreign sources were lowerthan expected during 2003 mainly due to the purchase of theSri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC) by a local entity, anddelays in the receipt of the ploceeds from the sale of 100 petrolstations and a common user facilities of Ceylon petroleumcorporation.

    "text": "In 2003, Sri Lanka was able to exceed its target of 500,000tourists, reaching 500,642. This is the highest number of touristarrivals in Sri Lanka so far, Tourist arrivals increased by 27.3per cent in 2003. Benefits of the ceasefire and peacenegotiations were felt strongly in the tourism sector. Recoveryof the global economy, especially Western Europe, alsocontributed to higher anivals. Gross earnings from the touristindustry increased by 39 per cent in 2003, from US dollars 248million in2002 to US dollars 324 million in 2003. The SriLanka Tourist Board (SLTB) expects to achieve a target of650,000 tourists arrivals in2004. This will exhaust existingroom capacity and other infrastructure facilities, particularlyduring peak seasons. In December 2003, room occupancy ratesincreased to77 per cent in the Colombo City, 64per cent in theancient cities and the southern coast, Insufficient flightfrequency and seating capacity too became major constraintsfor the expansion in the tourist industry.To increase accommodation, SLTB identified severallocations to develop tourist resorts. Under the 'South WestCoast Tourism and Community Infrastructure DevelopmentProject' funded by the Japan Bank for InternationalCooperation (JBIC) eight zones in the south west coast wereselected to develop infrastructure facilities. Two thousand acresof marshy land with inland water bodies in the Dedduwa andMarawila area were identified to be developed as a major eco- tourism site. A BOI project aiming at converting old mansionsand state bungalows for tourist accommodation is in place.As there are seasonal variations in tourist arrivals,promotional campaigns have been carried out by the SLTB andprivate tour organisers to promote Asian tourists to utiliseexisting capacity during off-peak seasons. The main targetmarkets are India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Thailand, Malaysiaand China, Sri Lanka was identified as an official destinationby China in 2002 and the private sector responded positivelyby initiating promotional campaigns in 2003. This gives accessto a large and fast growing market. Tourist arrivals fi'om Chinaincreased from 4,338 in 2002 to J ,251 in 2003, a 67 per centlncrease.To ease the constraint of flying fi'equency, SrilankanAirlines increased the number of flight destinations and",
