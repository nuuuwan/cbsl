ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL OVERHEADS

5.1 Overview

The quality and coverage of the available physical and socialinfrastructure supported by an efficient and effective regulatorysystem constitute the crucial factors for creating a conduciveinvestment climate in a country. However, as common to manydeveloping countries, Sri Lanka is in need of substantialimprovement in infrastructure facilities. The development ofinfrastructure responds positivery to liberalisation, derigulationIn some sectors and private sector participation as has beenexperienced in other countries. sri Lanka is not an exceptionto this general rule. The need for creating a conduciveenvironment for infrastructure development in sri Lanka hasbeen identified, but a vigorous pursuit of this goal has not beenfollowed adequately or continuously.Many enterprises supplying infrastructure services areowned by or remain monopolies of the government. Servicesrendered by many of these are below the expected servicenorms, while being unviable and therefore dependent ongovernment assistance, although they could be profitably run.To address these issues and improve the investment climate ofthe country, a wide range of reforms has already beensuggested and some are being implemented in areas such aselectricity, petroleum, passenger transportation, airtransportation, telecommunications, postal services, and portservices. The common features of these reforms are that: thesupply of services should be on a competitive basis; servicesshould be provided at affordable and cost effective prices; andbe operated by public-private parrnerships (ppp). with privatesector participation, inefficient public sector enterprises areexpected to operate efficiently under self-financingmechanisms, thereby reducing the burden on the state. otheradvantages ofPPP include expansion ofservices, risk transferfrom the public sector to the private sector and possibility ofadopting international best practices in terms of technologiesand managerial skills. Further, it would promote Iocalentrepreneurship and help deepen the local capital market.The government has a major role to play under ppp,

as private sector participation has not always been a success oradequate in some areas. The reasons for recent failures in somePPP were due to poorly structured arrangements and theabsence of important checks and balances. similarly, setting upa strong and efficient regulatory mechanism to monitorstandards and guidelines to safeguard the public interest isimportant, if the sector remains a monopoly or a closeoligopoly. The Public utilities commission of sri Lankaestablished under Act No. 35 of 2002 is expected to cany out

such regulatory functions, initially covering the electricity,water and petroleum sectors.In 2003, further progress in reforms was evidentparticularly in the petroleum, electricity, and rail transportationand telecommunication sectors. The domestic petroleummarket was opened for competition thus ending the monopolyin petroleum importation and distribution. Lanka Indian oilcorporation (LIoc) commenced retailing of petroleumproducts from March 2003. A third player in importing anddistributing petroleum products is expected to commenceoperations in 2004.In the petroleum sector, a common userfacility company, ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Ltd(CPSTL) to manage key petroleum infrastructure such as oilterminals, storage facilities and pipelines, was set up. Theformula based petroleum pricing policy was oughthere were some interventions, particular Iraqwar, when international petroleum prices w hightemporarily,Restructuring of the electricity sector, mainly byunbundling the key activities of the ceylon Electricity Board(CEB), was in progress in 2003. However, CEB faced a severecapacity shortage in the latter part of 2003 due to the drop inreservoir water levels, as there were no adequate alternativeenergy sources. Due to the high cost of power generation,CEB's financial position continued to be weak in 2003. Asolution to both inadequate capacity and high cost power is tosecure low cost large-scale power sources such as coal poweras early as possible. Though the system loss of the CEBdeclined slightly in 2003, it still remains high ar around 19 percent, requiring the power authorities to take appropriate actionto bring it down to an acceptable level.In terms of the Railway Authority of Sri Lanka Act No.60 of 1993, the sri Lanka Railway Department was convertedto an Authority in July 2003. In the new structure, rail servicesare expected to operate in a commercially viable manner,thereby reducing the burden on the budget. However, due toresistance fiom unions, a noteworthy improvement could notbe made in the rail services, except for the implementation ofthe fare revision. Air transportation revived with the increasein tourism, recovery in the world aviation industry, negotiationswith a number of countries to increase the number of servicesas well as destinations and reforms in the institutional structureby establishing the Civil Aviation Authoriry of Sri Lanka(CAASL) in place of the Department of Civil Aviation.The reforms in the telecommunications sector continuedin 2003. They included Iiberalising exrernal gareway

operations, and improving technology by introducing a 10 digitnumbering system for telephones and continuation of tariffrebalancing process. Harnessing the further potential of thesector was impeded as a result of underdevelopment of

bandwidth expansion, restricted licensing, and prevalence of

regulatory risks.Reforms in other infrastructure facilities such as

restructuring state owned bus companies and postal sectorreforms were also further delayed. In 2003, port services

displayed a strong growth supported by recovery in domestic

and international trade, improved productivity at the Port of

Colombo and effective marketing of port services. The housingmarket further expanded benefiting from the stable

macroeconomic environment, declining interest rates and

rising income levels.The public sector health services were crippled by

sporadic labour disputes in 2003. Health and education reforms

were in progress but at a slower pace. Although the provisionsin the Welfare Benefit Act were not yet implemented, thenumber of Samurdhi beneficiaries dropped due to strict

controls and various income enhancement programmes.The total government investment in infrastructure

increased marginally to 4.4 per cent of GDP in 2003, reversingthe declining trend observed in recent years. Government

investment in economic infrastructure was maintained at3'3

per cent of GDP, while investment in social infrastructure

increased to L l per cent of GDP.

expectancy and mortality rates, stands well above comparabledeveloping countries and is on par with many developedcountries. However, these achievements are now being

threatened by emerging and re-emerging communicable and

non-communicable diseases, demographic transition, highmalnutrition among children, accidents, suicides, substance

abuse, lack of a clear health policy, financial constraints and

weaknesses in the institutional set up and human resource

management. In recent years, govemment has not been able to

maintain the same level of investment in the health sector as in

the past due to budgetary constraints and due to other priority

expenses, such as financing the war, Financial constraints have

been central to most of these issues in the health sector.

Therefore, alternative sources of flnancing need to be explored

to maintain the current status of health, as well as for further

improvements.At present, the government's share in total health

expenditure in the country is around 50 per cent, while the

balance is financed by households (about 43 per cent in I99l)

and employers, insurance and non-profit organisations (7 per

cent),r A large part of public expenditure on health (about 90

per cent) and almost all private expenditure on health are oncurative healthcare services. According to the Household

Income and Expenditure Survey - 2002 of Department of

Census and Statistics, the average household expenditure on

health and personal care was 4.2 per cent of the total monthly

household expenditure. Underfunding of preventive healthcareposes great risk to the health status of the country. The

promotion of preventive healthcare services would reduce

morbidity to a great extent. The government would be able to

divert the required funds to preventive healthcare services by

targetting public health services to needy households. In this

respect, altemative financing sources, such as establishment ofpaying wards in hospitals, promotion of voluntary healthinsurance, encouraging gre ater financial autonomy for

government hospitals and promotion of private investment in

the curative health sector could be considered. This would

enable government to divert more funds for preventive

healthcare services and for health care needs of the deprived'Key recommendations made by the Presidential Task

Force (PTF) in 1991 continued to be implemented in 2003.Under the project to develop at least one hospital in each

district, 32 hospitals from the Westem medicine system and 23

hospitals from the indigenous medicine system have been

selected for development. The Polonnaruwa general hospital

and the Hambantota base hospital have already been developed

as pilot projects. In order to provide quality health care services

in the estate sector, 22 estate hospitals have been taken over by

the government and are being developed. Action has been taken

to decentralise mental health care services in order to promote

accessibility. Implementation of health sector reforms has beenslow, mainly due to financial constraints and lack of

commitment.

5.2 Health

The status of health of a population reflects the nature of thehuman capital endowment of the country, which is an

important factor in the production process and in achieving

development goals, The other dimensions of human capital,

namely education, training and skills development are also

largely dependent on the status of health. A healthier workforce

means higher productivity. Since independence, public

expenditure on health services has been high in Sri Lanka. As

a result, Sri Lanka, in terms of key health indicators such as life

Thele were 606 government hospitals at end 2003, with61,808 beds. According to the Ministry of Health, there were178 private medical institutions with 9,000 beds. Fulther, therewere 49 public Ayurvedic hospitals with 2,567 beds.Accordingly, the number of beds per 1,000 persons has beenestimated to be 3.8 at end 2003. The number of qualifiedmedical officers in the public health services increased by 12per cent to 8,342.It has been estimated that there were about800 qualified doctors in private practice, Accordingly, thenumber of persons per doctor dropped to 2,104 at end 2003. Inaddition, there were 1,289 Assistant Medical practitioners(AMPs) attached to government hospitals. The number ofnurses in government hospitals increased by 4 per cent to16,7 I I at end 2003. According to the Ministry of Health, therewere an estimated 8,000 qualified nurses attached to privatemedical institutions, thus increasing the number of nurses per100,000 persons to 123 at end 2003 fLom IZI ayear ago. Bothgovernment and private medical institutions suft'er from lackof trained health personnel particularly nurses and other para-medical staff. There are better employment opportunities in theforeign labour markets also for these categories of employment.Therefore, it is necessary to take appropriate measures toincrease training opportunities for health personnel in thecountry with the support of the private sector.The year 2003 was characterised by frequent disr-uptionsto the smooth conduct of public health services due to labourdisputes. The health sector lost a large number of mandays ofservice of medical officers and other health workers in 2003due to strikes, creating much hardship to patients. The disputeillustrates that key health workers were of the view that theywere inadequately compensated so that the return on theirinvestment is very low. In this case it would be difticult toretain skilled health workers in the system, while futureinvestments in the health profession also would be aff'ected. Atthe same time payment of a reasonable return on investmentalso would not be feasible within the existing fiamework undergovernment control. In 2003, major- outbreaks ofcommunicable diseases have not been reported as diseasesurveillance activities were strengthened, especially on Dengue

The National Commission on Macroeconomics

and Health (NCMH) established in2002 conrinued its acrivitiesin 2003 with a view to examining and exploring avenues togenerate finances for the health system. The NCMH conductedseveral rounds of meetings and workshops to formulate policiesin 2003. The preparation of a Master Plan for strengthening thehealth system was in progress in 2003. The Master Plan isexpected to cover areas such as reorienting the Ministry ofHealth's focus on the emerging needs, strengtheningdecentralised management, maintaining balanced allocation of

mechanisms and enhancing financing of community based

strategies. Construction work on the Sirimavo BandaranaikeSpecialised Children Hospital at Peradeniya was nearingcompletion in 2003. The total cost of the project is projectedto be Rs,6l0 million. The JBIC funded Blood BankDevelopment Project and the World Bank funded Human

Resources Development Programme were in progress in 2003.

5.3 Education

General Education

The national education system that underwent several phasesof reform since independence, is yet to reach an acceptablelevel of standard in terms of producing required skillsdemanded by changing labour market requirements, which

casts doubts on the efficacy of those reforms. A recent surveyundertaken by the National Education Commission (NEC)

reveals that extensive politicisation of the education system atall levels, lack of co-ordination among policy makers,inefficiency and incompetence in policy implementation and alack of motivation of service providers are the major issues inthe current education system. The NEC has made a set ofrecommendations to overcome those problems. Therecommendations include enhancement of educational

opportun iti es, curricul um renewal, professional development of

teachers and principals, improvement of education, governance

and resource allocation and efficient utilisation, However,

those recommendations did not contain a sustainable financingstrategy except depending on public funds. As budgetaryresources for the development of education are insufficient,

successful implementation of the aforesaid reforms depends on

the identification of altemative sources of resources, promotingprivate sector participation and accepting it explicitly as apolicy of the country.

The existing education system is a result of several wavesof reforms. The most recent reforms took place in 1998. As a

result, enrolments in primary, junior and secondary education

have improved while dropout rates have declined. The primary

education enrolment ratio increased in 2003, while the drop outratio declined. However, many schools, particularly those

located in rural areas, continued to suff-er from a lack of basic

i nfrastructure facilitie s such as bui ldings, laboratories, libraries,

educational equipment and other ancillary facilities.By end 2003, there were 10,475 functioning schools,

including private schools and pirivenas. The student populationin all schools declined by 2 per cent to 4,091,336 in 2003. On

average there is a school for every 6 sq kms in the country. The

average number of students per government school droppedfrom 410 in2002to 402 in 2003. The pupiliteacher ratio inpublic schools was 2l in 2003. At end 2003, there were 85private schools with 55,725 students.With a view to reducing the regional disparities in theeducation system, several steps have been taken to improveeducational infrastructure facilities in the plantation sector,

junior secondary schools in rural areas, and schools in conflictaffected areas. The development of a few selected schools on

a district basis also continued as a country strategy for reducing

congestion in urban schools, especially in main towns, Teacher

trarning and skills development have been recognised as vitalfactors for effective implementation of education policy. Toovercome the existing shortage of trained and qualified

teachers, in 2003, a total of 3,848 trainees have been admittedto colleges of education. Foreign training opportunities were

also provided to a few teachers and principals. Although thereis an excess of teachers in general, shortages of teachers existin the areas of English, Aesthetic Studies and in technical

subjects. As proposed in the educationalreforms, action is also

being taken to rectify those disparities.In view of recent productivity growth in developed andemerging economies, largely attributable to the adoption of

Information and Communication Technology (ICT), a need has

arisen to develop ICT training at the school level. During2003,

a total of 292 information technology centres were establishedin schools, and 1,800 teachers were provided with training oninformation technology.The second General Education Project funded by theWorld Bank continued to provide assistance in curriculumdevelopment, publication of text books, rationalisation of

schools, supply of quality inputs particularly teaching materialsin subjects such as Science, Mathematics, Environmental

Science and English to schools, development of libraries andeducational research and studies, The World Bank fundedTeacher Education and Teacher Deployment Programmefinanced projects designed for rationalisation of teacherdeployment, improvement of teacher education. and

strengthenin-e of administration and management in teacher

education institutions. The secondary Education Modernisation

Project continued in 2003, implementing several programmesfor the improvement of the quality of education by

strengthening the teaching and learning process.

Student welfare programmes, such as distribution of freeuniforms, textbooks, and provision of subsidised bus season

tickets, were continued in 2003. Total government expenditure

on these programmes amounted to Rs. 1,820 million in 2003.A multiple textbook system was introduced in 2003 to

encourage students towards self-learning.Total government expenditure on education, including

higher education, was Rs 39,1 l6 million in 2003, a 5.1 per cent

increase over the previous year. Total expenditure as a per cent

of GDP was2.2 per cent in comparisonto2.4 per cent in2002.

Higher Education

Government is the sole operator of accredited universities in Sri

Lanka at present. All 12 national universities and the OpenUniversity are run by the public sector. Due to limited

opportunities available at the universities, there exists a large

excess demand for university education. For example, in 2003,

a total of 213,201candidates appeared for the G.C.E.(A/L)examination. Of these, 44 per cent obtained the minimum

TABLE 5.4General and University Educationdearth of funds so as to introduce any worthwhile reformprogramme, on the one hand, and retain the services ofcompetent academic, on the other. The dependence on thestate sector solely for funding the universities withoutexploring alternative sustainable sources has created a majorimpediment for the university system to keep pace with thedevelopments in the rest of the world. To complicate thematter, an unsalutory development has been the occunence offrequent student disputes that result in prolonged closure ofuniversities, thereby reducing the number of effectiveacademic days. As a consequence, the universities have notbeen able to follow a pre-announced academic calendar as isbeing followed by universities in the rest of the world,including neighbouring India, The failure to complete a pre-announced academic programme coupled with diminishedmorale of students due to uncertainty, substantially reducedthe quality of the graduates, as experienced by manyprospective employers who in turn have expressly preferredprofessional qualifications in the young employed overacademic qualifications.A sad observation has been that student leaders and manyuniversity academics who appear in public fora seen to beoblivious to this alarming development. Instead of creating apositive mind-frame in students, the blame for the plight in thepublic university system is squarely placed on elsewhereleading to violent uprisings in the universities that destroy thetrue academic spirit that should prevail for intellectualadvancement. It is therefore, high time for all stakehorders inthe university education viz., academics, students and taxpayersto initiate a conflict resolution process to search for answers forthe deepening crisis in the system.The private sector is mainly engaged in the provision ofprof-essional education, particularly in the areas of accountancy,management and information technology. Although there areprovisions in the existing Universities Act No. l6 of 1978 torecognise degree courses conducted by private institutions, theprocess for this is not clear. The University Grants Commissron(UGC) has granted degree-awarding status to conduct someparticular courses. Meanwhile, some private institutionsconduct courses leading to degrees in collaboration withfbLeign universities. However, it is expected that the quality andmarket relevance of degree programmes conducted by publicand private universities will be improved in an competitiveenvrronment.In addition to state-run universities, there are several otherpublic and private institutions, which conduct courses mainlyrelating to information technology and some other professionarsubjects. The Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technologyenrolled 2,700 new students to its IT based courses, Newadmissions to courses in the Open University were 11,000 in2003.In addition, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of SriLanka, the National Institute of Business Management, and theSri Lanka Law College were the major providers ofplofessional education.

Meanwhile, theexisting university system in sri Lanka has produced a largenumber of graduates who could not be emproyed unless furtherjob related training is provided, This is due ro a lack ofcun'iculum reforms in line with changing needs of the labourmarket, lack of choice of courses, and resource constraints toimplement reforms, Therefore, a large number of Sri Lankanstudents who can afford foreign university education leave SriLanka annually. Due to the present level of economicdevelopment in Sri Lanka, many cannot afford foreignuniversity education, thus, barring them from acquiring skillsneeded to meet the growing demand for human capital. Hence,fostering competitive accredited universities with private sectorparticipation could generate human capital needed for SriLanka's own development, and could also be an importanttradable service.As stated in the Central Bank Annual Report for 2002(P.124) Sri Lanka's state sector universities suffer from a

The establishment of youth corps, in telms of the Youth

Corps Act No 21 of 2002, was a mechanism to mobiliseunemployed youth [o centres, provide them with self-development and vocational training, and make them

employabie by prospective employers. Such a mechanismis an effbctive intervention by the government when thereis a mismatch between the job requirements and availableskills,

The overail unemploymenl rate in Slr Lanka has beenon a declining ttend since the 1980s. It has declined to alevel around 8 per cent at present. Horvever, unemploymentamong educated youth has been much hi-eher t.han thenaticlnal average and is on the increase. The mismrtchbetu'een educational attainments arrd labour marketrequirements has been cited as the mrin contdbutor-to thisalarmin-{ development, High unemployment among theyouth has its economic, social and political implications.

The youth corps intend to bridge the gap between the labour'mirlket requirement and level of skills, while meeting

employment expectations of the youth. In addition to formal

education. those rvho seek employment in modern labour

markets require ploficiency in fbreign languages and a highlevel of computer literacy, as well as qurlities such asversatility, flexibility iurd adaptability, confidence to take upchallenges, a positive work ethic, high productivity,discipline, leadership, dedicati0n, commitment andteamwork. Opportunities are not available for many

students who complete the current formal educirtion toattain these qualities. The youth corps are expected to flll

the gap so that the y'outh lvould be able to secure gainful

employment in the competitive labour market. It has beenplanned to provide training initially to around 40,000unemployed young persons under the youth corpsprogramme. For this purpose, 160 youth corps centres, eachwith the capacity to train 250 persons at a time. has beenplanned to be set up at electorate levels. The period oftraining will be l8 months. AccoLdingly, when thepr'ogramme is fully operationtil, 40,000 youth could be

trained in evely I l/2}'sil''.. The basic qualifications to enrolin the youth corps is passing the GCE (Oil-) examinationwith six subjects in not more than two sittings and be in thel8 - 28 year age group. The trainees (called 'Rangers') alepaid amonthly allowance of Rs. 2,000. The government hasallocated Rs. 1,000 million in 2003 and Rs. 1,500 millionin 2004 for the implementation of the youth corps

pro*qramme.

The youth corps training comprises five main phases :1. Basic training (10 rveeks): For training the 1,outh as a

dedicated and disciolined force that could work as a

team.2. Outrvard-bound training (1 week): To developplanning, leadership, teamrvork capabilities, and

conf idence building lo face challenges.3. Development work (25 weeks): To provideopportunities to learn and serve the country, whilef'eeling a sense of dignity of labour, ivork ethics and

best practices of national service, including leadership,

team building, dedication and self--reliance.4. Vocational training (35 weeks): To equip youth rvith

employable skills to find employment or to start theirown entefprlses.5. Post training tracking (on a regular basis): Torevierv the progress of youth corp activities

govemment, private sector and NGOs. Career guidance andcounselling i,l'ill be important components of the youth

corps programme and rvill run through the entire period ofl8 months.

During 2003, training rvas provided to 850 youth(lalled as youth corps leaders) who would, in turn, beinvolved in the training of rangers in youth corps centres.A total of 19 youth ranger-training centres have been

established in 2003 and during the fir st tlo months of 2004.A total o1'3,386 rangers were undetgoing training at these

centres. The balance tlainins centt'es are to be establishedin 2004.

The youth corps progranrme is a novel idea introduced

tbr solving the unemployment problem among the educatedyouth in a sustainable nranner. It would be impoltant to

ensure that the young rangers are plovided with knowledgeon financin,q of se lf-employment plojects, basicbookkeeping, marketin-g, current economic policies etc., as

that could be useful in case they decide to undertake such

Technical Education and Vocational Training(rEVr)

The emphasis placed on general and university education andthe oversight of the importance of technical and vocationaltraining have partly been responsibre for a shortage of skilledmanpower, and hence, unemployment among the educatedyouth.

The institutions involved in the TEVT sector continued toprovide job oriented training as well as skills developmentprogrammes aimed mainly at school leavers. vocationaleducation reforms were introduced recently with a view todeveloping technical capabilities and promoting skills that areessential for industrial development and diversification as wellas to generate self-employment opportunities. with theassistance of international donor agencies, the governmentcontinued TEVT sector reforms in 2003. skills developmentprojects funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) haveexpanded their activities in order to improve the quality andrelevance of training in private sector training institutions.The Tertiary and vocationar Education commission(TVEC) is the policy making institution in this sector. otherinstitutions involved in TEVT are the Department of rechnicalEducation and rraining (DTET), sri Lanka Institute ofAdvanced Technical Education (SLIATE), the vocationalTraining Authority (vrA), and the National Institure ofTechnical Education of Sri Lanka (NITESL). In 2003, theseinstitutions together trained 56,192 youth in various areas ofvocational training. The DTET conducted its training coursesat certificate level through its 36 technical colleges. A total of17,339 students enrolled for these courses in 2003. SLIATEconducted diploma level courses in the fields of Engineering,Information Technology, Agriculture, Commerce andBusiness Studies and 2,308 students were trained in 2003. Atotal of 22,773 students enrolled for courses conducted byVTA through vocational training centers during the year,NITESL is mainly involved in teacher training and curriculumdevelopment in the entire technical education and vocationaltraining sector in the country. It has conducted 15 short-termteacher training and skills development programmes and 3Information Technology courses of 6 months duration for1,561 teachers and instructors in the TEVT sector during 2003.Meanwhile, a total of 13,772 trainees were enrolled by theNational Apprenticeship and Industrial rraining Authority(NAITA) for l0l courses for technicians, It has been observedthat physical infrastructure in some of these institutions islargely under-utilised and there is a greater potential to furtherexpand services provided by these institutions.Improving the quality and relevance of vocational trainingthrough enhancing the competence of teachers and cuniculumdevelopment, and upgrading existing infrastructure in traininginstitutions, are the major challenges and issues in the sector.Education being an inter-temporal investment, i.e.investments today will bring returns in the future, requires to

take cognizance of the structural changes in production,distribution and consumption and produce the skills to meet thefuture requirements. The first grade technology that wouldcommand mastership in the future world would comprisegenetic engineering, nano- technology and distributedintelligence in computer technology and a race has alreadybegun in the developed world to gain superiority in these areas.The future job market is globalised and will take the form ofoff-sharing (setting up production centres in less costlycountries), outsourcing (engaging low cost entities to produceneeded inputs), insourcing (pooling of resources in the sameentity to attain optimal output) and smart sourcing (engaginghigh tech specialised agencies to produce specific outputs).Hence, the current education planning should prepare today'sstudents to be a part of the future world economy, for otherwiseall worthwhile jobs would be grabbed by Sri Lanka'scompetitors, such as India, Singapore, Thailand and thePhilippines. This should receive the highest priority ineducation planning and resource allocation, in order for sriLanka to avoid repeating another episode of ,missing

opportunities' in the future.

5.4 Communication ServicesTelecommunications

Rapid development in the telecommunications industry is aglobal phenomenon. Fixed access and mobile celrurar servicesgrew internationally by 1l per cent in 2003. In Sri Lanka, thetelecommunications sector, supported by a more liberalisedmarket environment, showed a sharp expansion in 2003. Thesubscriber network for fixed access and mobile cellularservices grew by 29 per cent compared to 2l per cent in2002. The growth reflects the sharp expansion in the mobilecellular market, which grew at 50 per cent in 2003. The mainfactors behind this rapid growth have been liberalisation,private ownership and increased competition. The subscriberbase of fixed access telephones increased by I per cent to939,013 in 2003.The Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of SriLanka (TRCSL) introduced three major reforms in 2003,namely, opening up of the external gateway for competition,introduction of l0 digit numbering system, and the completionof the fifth and final tariff re-balancing of the Sri LankaTelecom (SLT). Opening of external gateway operationsterminated the monopoly enjoyed by SLT. As a result, 32licences were issued to private parties to operate externalgateways by end 2003, and it resulted in a reduction ofinternational direct dialing (IDD) call charges by over 50 percent since March 2003.IDD calls also grew considerably andthe number of subscribers for IDD facilities provided by SLTalone increased by 25 per cent, The final tariff re-balancing, asstipulated in the shareholders' agreement signed by theGovernment of Sri Lanka (GOSL) and Nippon Telegraph andTelephone Corporation of Japan (NTT) in Augusr 1997,removed the cross subsidy from international calls to local calls

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2OOg117

Part IChapter 5 - ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL OVERHEADS

to a large extent, which resulted in an increase in the monthly

rental for residential telephones to Rs. 594 from Rs. 240, whileproviding the first 200 units free of charge. The discount time

period has also been extended by an hour, benefiting Internet

and e-mail users.The introduction of a 10 digit number systemaccommodated the increasing demand for telecommunication

services in line with regional and international standards. Thelong-awaited Calling Party Pays (CPP) scheme was to be

implemented from 2004. The implementation of this scheme

would have resulted in incoming calls being free of charge, butoutgoing calls would have had a higher tariff. However, the

scheme was postponed due to disputes relating to outgoing call

charges. The progress of the National Telecommunications

Policy has been suspended, contributing to increased regulatory

uncertainty. The uncertainty is manifested in the lack of clear

procedures in applying tor and granting new licences to operateboth fixed access and mobile telephone services, andinsufficient regulatory strength.

The reform process that began in l98l made Sri Lanka's

telecommunication sector the most liberal sector in South Asiaby end 1990s. This gave impetus to the development of the

information technology industry in SriLanka, However, fufther

expansion of the industry to compete with other countries in the

region has been impeded by inadequate bandwidth expansion,restricted licensing, prevalence of regulatory risk etc.Neighboring countries, especially India, which beganliberalisation of the sector after Sri Lanka. accelerated the

process by early opening up of the external gateway,

introduction of CPP and expanding the bandwidth, coupledwith creating a conducive policy environment to provide

essential infrastructure to gain a competitive edge in attractinginformation technology related investment. This has paid

greater dividends to India as it already had made strides in the

development of the complementary knowledge and human

capital in information technology,

The demand for fixed line telephones grew faster outside

the Colombo Metropolitan area, reducing the disparity of

distribution. The number of fixed line telephones (wireline) in

service rose by 6 per cent in the Colombo Metropolitan area,while in other areas it grew by 7 per cent. The national

telephone density (telephones per 100 persons) for fixed

access telephones increased from 4.6 in2002 to 4.9 in 2003.

The mobile telephone network expanded by 50 per cent in

2003 after a 40 per cent growth in 2002, Improvements tncellular telephone technology, aggressive competition,affordable initial costs, quick supply and expansion of

coverage have been the main reasons for the significantgrowth in this sector. As a result, telephone density including

cellular phones, increased to 12.l in 2003 from 9.5 in2002.

The penetration of mobile telephones in relation to fixed

access telephones increased to 148 in 2003 from 105 in2002.Internet and e-mail services are also expanding rapidly.

Subscribers to Internet and e-mail services, provided by 27

operators, increased by 22 per cent in 2003.

Part lChapter 5 - ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL OVERHEADS

The market share of telephone services is dominated bymobile operators, with a share of 60 per cent in 2003. The r.estis distributed among three fixed access service providers. Thelargest share of fixed access services was owned by SLT,followed by two wireless local loop (WLL) operators. Mobilecellular services were provided by 4 operators. SLT, the largestfixed access operator, acquired the ownership of Mobitel, acellular service provider,The geographical dispersion of services shows that thereis a heavy concentration of telecommunication facirities inColombo. Out of the total fixed access phones, 45 per cent werein the Colombo Metropolitan area at end 2003. Developmentof telecommunications, especially in rural areas, is very muchdependent on the use of radio frequency spectrum, Radiofrequency spectrum is needed in increasing quantities by WLLtelephones and cellular mobile operators, broadcasters, civilaviation authorities, the military, police and securityorganisations, government departments and some privateinstitutions. The new generation of wireless mobile servicesrefened to as Universal Mobile Telephone Services (UMTS)or Third Generation also requires new allocation of spectr-um.Managing the use of this scarce resource among thesecompeting uses is the main responsibility of the TRCSL.To expedite the supply of telecommunication facilities inrural areas, the TRCSL introduced a subsidy scheme in 1999,under which a subsidy is paid to payphone operators, whoinstall payphones in rural areas. TRCSL has gradually raisedthe subsidy amount from Rs.50,000 to Rs.75,000 per payphoneinstallation. Furthermore, the maximum number of eligibleinstallations was raised to 175 from an initiar 25 installationsper distnct, per operator.A number of projects were in progress to improvetelecommunication facilities in the North and the East, Aproject to establish a link between Sri Lanka and India wascompleted in 2003. It connected the two countries by amicrowave link between Talaimannar and Rameswaram inIndia. Telecommunication operators introduced newtechnology and various value added services to their customer sin 2003.

The long waiting list for wireline telephones, especially inrural areas, is one of the main obstacles to developingtelecommunication related activities in Sri Lanka. This ismainly due to insufficient competition and limited capacity inthe industry. This contributes to the low tele-density in SriLanka, which stands at 4.9 per 100 persons. This comparesadversely with many countries in the region. (Korea - 48.9,Malaysia - 19.0, Maldives - 10.2, Singapore-- 46.3, Thailand- 10.5). It has been highlighted that given the high level ofliteracy in Sri Lanka, there is a greater potential to furtherdevelop information based activities such as telemarketing, callcentres, remote data processing and Internet based products ifthe necessary infrastructure is available adequately.

Postal ServicesA reliable and fast postal service is an essential part of amodern infrastructure system as it carries out important socialand economic functions. The postal infrastructure in Sri Lankais one of the largest networks of service delivery systems in thecountry, with great potential to serve the public better with amultitude of products. The network could harness the potentialof rapidly growing information technology industry indelivering a wider anay of services. The postal service couldprovide newer services, such as electronic money transfer,insurance and pension related services, utility bill payments ande-government services, especially where those services are notcurrently available, A hindrance to such developments in theservice is due to the structural set up of the Postal Department,which does not allow full scale adoption of such services in acost eff'ective manner. Therefore, it is necessary to introducebroad-based institutional reforms and service modernisation inthe postal service in the country. The Postal Reform Billprovides the required legal statute and basic framework forsuch modernisation. However, it has not yet been implemented.The netwolk expanded slightly to 4,680 post offices in2003 from 4,616 in 2002. With the objective of providing awider range of services especially to rural areas,'communication locales' were introduced in 2002. Theselocales supply regular post office services, as well as sale ofstationary, e-marl and Internet services, fax and photo copying

services etc. There were 100 such communication locales by

end 2003. The average area served by a post office improvedmarginally to 14 sq. km, in 2003 from 14.2in2002, while thepopulation served by a post office also improved slightly to4,100 from 4,102 in 2002. With the expansion of electroniccommunication services, the volume of physical mail articles,both inland and foreign, decreased slightly in 2003. Theaverage number of letters per person handled by theDepartment of Posts (DOP) also decreased slightly to 24 dunng2003 from 25 in2002.

Despite such developments, the DOP continued to incurlosses. The total revenue of DOP increased by 9 per cent to Rs.2,326million while its total operating expenditure glew slightlyto Rs. 2,823 million. Consequently, an operating loss of Rs. 497million was recorded in 2003, burdening the budget. In addition

a capital expenditure of Rs. 574 million was made to the PostalDepartment.

5.5 Energy

Electricity

The work initiated for restructuring the electricity sector,mainly by unbundling the key activities of the CeylonElectricity Board (CEB), was in progress in 2003 albeit slowly.However, CEB faced a severe capacity shortage in the latterpart of 2003 due to the drop in reservoir water levels, as therewere no alternative energy sources, including thermal power.This occured after a brief recovery in the first half of 2003,followed by severe shortages in the two preceding years.Favourable weather during the first half of the year andexpansion in power generating capacity, although not suft'icientto meet the increasing demand, helped a temporary recovery.There are no signs of a sustainable and steady supply of powerin the near future, as appropriate action to fufther expand thepower supply has not been taken as per the demand estimatesfor the medium to long-term.The initial steps in restructuring the power sector, whichenvisaged unbundling of power generation, transmission anddistribution in terms of the Electricity Sector Reforms ActN0.28 of 2002, have been taken. CEB would be broken downinto seven companies,viz., five distribution companies, onegeneration company and one transmission company. Powergeneration companies will compete with the private sector.The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka. constituted

under the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 35of 2002, will become the regulatory authority for theelectricity sector.The total installed capacity increased by 15 per cent to2,223 MW in 2003, with the commissioning of CEB owned70 MW Kukule Ganga hydropower plant and the 165 MWcombined cycle power plant owned by the private sector.The share of the private sector in the total capacity increased

1o 26 per cent in 2003 from 24 per cent in 2002. With theexpansion of thermal power capacity, the hydropower

dependency of the power system declined from 6l per centin 2002 to 56 per cent in 2003. Despite the capacityexpansion, a continuous electncity supply was at risk towardsthe end of the year as hydropower generation was affectedby the drought, The drought conditions caused the reservoircapacity to remain below 42 per cent throughout the secondhalf of the year,

Total electricity generation increased by l0 per cent to

'7 ,612 GWh in 2003 as a result of the recovery in power supplyfrom the lower base in 2002. The share of hydropower in thetotal power generation increased to 43 per cent from 39 per centin 2002. Power purchases from the private sector declined to29 per cent from 35 per cent in 2002 mainly due to a sharpdecline in the use of emergency power and non-implementationof self-generation schemes. All emergency power plants,except for the 30 MW power plant in the North, had beendecommissioned by June 2003 in view of the favourable waterlevels in reservoirs during the first half of 2003 and thecommissioning of 2 new power plants during the second halfof the year.

The total electricity consumption increased by l3 per centto 6,208 GWh in 2003. Electricity consumption grew only by5 per cent in the preceding year, due to frequent power cuts.Electricity consumption in the domestic, industrial and general

purpose categories expanded by 11 percent, 16 per cent and 13

In the domesticsector, the average consumption of electricity of a householdwas 68 KWh per month, The proportion of households withelectricity increased to 68 per cent f'om 64per cent a year ago,as ruralelectntication progfammes were expedited. The systemlosses, though declining slightly from 21.5 per cent to l9.l percent, still remain high, requiring action to reduce it to anacceptable level.The financial situation of the CEB continued to remainweak in 2003 mainly due to the high cost of powergeneration and high cost of servicing large amounts of short-te.m debt. According to provisional data, CEB has reportedan operating profit of Rs. 940 million for 2003, incomparison to a Rs. 7 billion loss in 2002. CEB's short-termbank borrowings stood at Rs. l3 billion at end 2003. Ascurrent tariffs are high in relation to other similal countries,the loss making nature of the CEB's operations shouldemanate mainly from high cost of power generation. Theaverage cost of electricity to CEB increased to Rs. 7.9g perunit from Rs.7.78 per unit in 2002. The average tariff wasRs. 7.68 per unit in 2003. As Sri Lanka's power system isgradually shifting from a predominantly hydropower to

thermal power, it is essential to move to low cost sources ofthermal power, such as coal power, to maintain the long-termviability of the power sector as well as to supply electricityto end-users at an affordable price. As power is an essentialinput for other industries, the high cost of power generationraises the cost of production in all other industries, therebyhaving a major impact on Sri Lanka's competitiveness.The Energy Supply Commirtee (ESC) has called forExpressions of lnterest flom prospective investors to constructa 300 MW coal power plant on a BOO basis forcommissioning by 2008. CEB intends to commenceconstruction work of the proposed 150 MW Upper Kotmalehydropower plant in 2004.In addition, CEB has identified aseries of low cost capacity expansion projects in its long-termgeneration expansion plan to meet the growing demand.These power projects need to be implemented as scheduled toavoid any power shortage in the future. At the same time, theproposed restructuring of the power sector needs to beexpedited to improve the efficiency and viability of the sector.A durable solution to both capacity shortage and high costpower is to secure low cost, large-scale power sources such ascoal power,

Petroleum

The local petroleum market was opened for competition in

2003 ending the monopoly held by CPC since its inception.CPC was established in l96l with monopoly rights inpetroleum imports, refining, export, and distribution, by

nationalising a f'ew private sector foreign companies operating

in the country. The petroleum sector restructuring process was

commenced in the early 1990s. Accordingly, Colombo GasLtd., Lanka Lubricants Ltd., and Lanka Marine Setvices Ltd.,which were subsidiaries of CPC, have already been privatised.

In 2003, Lanka Indian OilCorporation (LIOC) entered the local

market for importing arnd retailing petroleum products. LIOCcommenced its petroleum distribution through 100 filling

stations, which were previously owned by CPC. In addition,

another 107 tilling stations owned by CPC have been identifiedfor sale to a third party to be licensed in 2004. At end 2002,

there were 1,074 filling stations in the country, of which 362were owned by CPC. A storage and distribution company,

called Ceylon Petroleum Stora-qe Terminals Ltd. (CPSTL), rvasincorporated in November 2003 to manage common userfacilities such as oil terminals, storage facilities and pipelines.

The aviation re-fuelling function has also been identifled for

diversification in the f'uture, With these reforms and improvingcompetition, the petroleum sector is expected to operateefficiently, based on market principles, for the benefit ofconsumers. The beneficial effects of the liberalisatton are

already beginning to be evident as CPC and the LIOC have

cemmenced upgradin-e their filling stations to provide a better

servlce to consumers,International oil prices lemained high in 2003 and

fluctuated between US dollars 25 and 35 (Btent crude oil) in

2003. CPC's average import price of crude oilincreased to US

dollars 29 per barrel from US dollars 25 per bzurel in 2002. Inline with international prices, local petroleum prices wererevised in terms of the pricing formula, except in several

months during the Iraq war and in a few months towards the

end of the year, when international oil prices were high. Thepricing formula, which was introduced in January 2002, was

revised in January 2004 so as to reflect more details of cost

components and profit margins.

The demand for major petroleum products declined by 2

per cent in 2003. Consumption of petrol (90 octane) increasedby 18 per cent, following the l4 per cent increase in the

preceding year. The sharp increase in the registration of petroldriven motor vehicles and narrowing down of the price

differences between petrol and diesel seem to have caused thissignificant increase in petrol consumption in recent years. The

use of LP gas to fuel motor vehicles also dropped by 19 pet centin 2003. Diesel consumption constituted about 49 per cent of

the total consumption of major petroleum products. Keroseneconsumption declined by I per cent as kerosene used forlighting purposes is declining rapidly with expansion in the

supply of electricity. Furnace oil sales by CPC declined by 8

per cent in 2003. The share of CPC in total petroleum sales was

93 per cent in 2003, while the balance was supplied by LIOC.

CPC imported 1,995,000 MT of crude oil and 1,168,286 MT

of refined petroleum products, while LIOC imported 225,904

MT of refined petroleum ptoducts in 2003 to meet the demand.

As petrol ploduction at the refinery is almost sufficient to meetthe entire domestic demand, LIOC purchased its pettol

requirement from the CPC. Meanwhile, LP gas sales increased

by 3 per cent in 2003, after an I I per cent increase in 2002. LP

gas sales to domestic and industnal sectors increased while that

to auto gas sector declined, A third LP gas distributor. Mundo

Gas Lanka Ltd, entered the domestic market in 2003 increasing

the competition in the LP gas market.CPC's financial position did not improve as much as

expected rn 2003, as there has been only a partial pass-through

of increased costs resulting mainly from high international oilprices. The monthly price adjustments as required by theformula based pricing policy were implemented only on 6

occasions, though price adjustments were needed on I I

occasions, especially in respect of diesel and kerosene.However, according to provisional data CPC reported around

Rs. 3 billion of operating profit in 2003 on a gross turnover ofRs. I I I billion. CPC reduced its short-term bank bonowingsby Rs. 2 billion in 2003 to Rs. 16.2 billion. In 2003, CPC

received US dollars 22 million out of the sale proceeds of its

assets to LIOC. The canying cost of the large short-term bankborrowings is very high. It would adversely affect CPC'scompetitiveness in the emerging competitive markel

environment. Therefore, it would be prudent to use future

proceeds from sales of CPC assets to repay CPC's short-term

borrowings.The Muthurajawela tank farm project to store petroleum

products was completed in 2003. These tanks have the capacity

to store 250,000 cubic meters of diesel and kerosene, The total

cost of the project was Rs.7,7 billion and rvas funded by a US

dollar 72 million loan fiom the Exim Bank of China. The new

aviation terminal at BIA was also completed in 2003. Initial

work in respect of the Oil Exploration Promotion Project and

5.6 Transportation

Roads

There was limited progress in developing the road network inthe country in 2003, except for the commencement of theconstruction of the Southern highway in 2003. One of the mainfeatures of road construction and maintenance in the countryis that these are sole responsibility of the public sector anddependent on budgetary allocations. Given the current fiscal

constraints, the government is not in a position to allocatesufficient funds and hence a number of planned road projectshave been abandoned or delayed. The economic and social costof this is significant. Therefore, there is an urgent need toexplore alternative financing sources to improve the roadnetwork, which is vital for achieving economic and socialprogress. Raising financial resources in the capital market andincreasing direct private sector investment should resolvefunding problems to some extent.As an alternative source of funds to finance roadmaintenance, Budget 2003 proposed to establish a Road Fundthrough the imposition of a special levy. The Fund would bemanaged by a Board comprising representatives of the public

and private sector. Accordingly, the excise duty on imports of

petrol and diesel was increased by Rs.l.00 and Rs.0.50 per liter,respectively, from August 2003 to raise money for the Fund.

The total amount received by the Treasury as contribution to

the Road Fund during2003 amounted to Rs 900 million, The

Road Fund and the Road Board, which have not yet been setup, need to be duly established to fulfill this purpose. Evensome foreign funded projects have faced delays due to theproblems associated with land acquisition and litigation.The Road Development Authority (RDA), the keyinstitution responsible for the development and maintenance ofthe national highway network, maintains 11,650 km of tlunk(A class) and main (B class) roads, and 3,902 bridges. TheRDA spent Rs.ll,8l1 million during 2003, a 20 per centincrease over the previous year. Further, the centralgovernment allocated Rs.1,363 million to provincial councilsfor development and maintenance of C and D class roadsduring 2003.During 2003, the RDA implemented several major roadprojects with foreign financial assistance. The main one was theSouthern Expressway project, which consists of two sections

separately funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and

Japanese Bank for International Development (JBIC). The totalestimated project cost is Rs. 29 billion. Work on the ADBfunded section, from Kurundugahahetepma to Godagama,commenced in early 2003 and is expected to be completed in2006. Construction work of the JBIC funded Kottawa toKurundugahahetepma section is expected to commence in2004.During the year, the RDA continued to implement theRoad Network Improvement Project (RNIP) with financial

assistance from ADB and JBIC to rehabilitate 345 kilometersof roads and to improve 47 bridges. Rehabilitation of theKandy-Jaffna Road (the A-9 road) was commenced in 2003and is expected to be completed by early 2004. Several roaddevelopment projects, in particular rehabilitation of bridges,were carried out with financial assistance from the JapaneseInternational Co-operation Agency (JICA) and the KuwaitFund for Arab Economic Development.During the year, the RDA canied out special projects tbr

the rehabilitation of 20 roads with a total length of 120 kms at

a cost of Rs.1,000 million of local funds, It also cohducted aprogramme focusing on improving rural roads to motorableconditions for the benefit of the rural communities. Under this

programme ,J2 rurtl roads with a total length of approximately2,410 kms have been completed at a cost of Rs, 58 million.With a view to allowing the private sector to carry out roadconstruction and maintenance work, the RDA closed-down theRoad Construction and Development Company (RCDC), asubsidiary of the RDA that canied out most of the construction

and rehabilitation work on its behalf. The services of around6,000 employees of RCDC were to be terminated after thepayment of compensation.With a view to reducing traffic congestion within theColombo City, an Outer Circular Highway has been proposed,

linking all major roads radiating from Colombo. The estimatedcost of this 28 km highway is Rs.17 billion and it is expectedto be funded by JICA. Ground surueys for detailed designingwere in progress in 2003. The proposed Colombo - Kandy

Expressway, at an estimated cost of Rs.29 billion, is expected

to be implemented on a BOT basis. In this respect, an MOU hasbeen signed between the Government of Sri Lanka and theConstruction lndustry Development Board of Malaysia.Construction work on the Colombo - Katunayaka Expressway,which was originally estimated to be completed at a cost r-'rfRs.l4 billion, and commenced with local funds in October

2000, was terminated due to financial difficulties and designingproblems. The project is now expected to be recommenced on

the basis of a public private partnership.The Baseline Road (Phase III) Extension Project is thecontinuation of the Baseline Road f}om Kirulapone Junction to

the Galle Road at Ratmalana (7.5 kms.). The RDA has designedthe road, but acquisition of land have been suspended due to

resistance from residents.In addition to highway projects, several other road

development and improvement projects have been identified by

the RDA during 2003. The rehabilitation and improvement of

the Balangoda - Beragala - Bandarawela road, Hatton - NuwaraEliya road and Puttalam -Anuradhapura-Trincomalee road,have already been initiated. With a view to reducing trafficcongestion in Colombo, a number of road projects such as theMarine Drive, Duplication Road and Colombo Road PackageII have been identified, but have been suspended due tofinanci al constraints.

Road Passenger Transportation

Passenger bus services contribute to about 80 per cent of theoverall passenger transpolt service in the country. Private

sector bus operators account for about two thirds, while the

balance is provided by public sector bus services consisting of

I I Regional Transport Companies (RTCs, also called clusterbus companies), the Northern Region Transport Board andVavniya Passenger Transport Services Ltd. monitored by SriLanka Central Transport Board (SLCTB).A series of shortcomings have been cited in both thepublic and private sector passenger bus operations in thecountry over the last f'ew decades. Among them, poor service

and quality, an inadequate number of buses operating on someroutes, especially in remote areas, non availability or non-

adherence to time tables, unqualified crew, poor infrastructurefacilities such as bus stands, bus halts etc., increasing operating

costs and low profit margins have been prominent. The RTCs

are highly overstaffed, particularly in certain clencal and alliedcategories. However, in respect of crews, technical and

engineering grades are understaffed. At the same time, RTCs

are under capitalised.RTCs have undergone severe financial difficulties andexperienced operating losses, since most RTCs have not been

able to generate sufficient revenue even to cover their operating

124Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2003

Part IChapter 5 - ECONOMIC AND SOCTAL OVEFHEADS

costs such as basic repairs and maintenance of the existingfleet, The situation has worsened due to low, administrativelyset fares that have not been adjusted in a timely and appropriatemanner. As a result of these financial difficulties, RTCs weregranted government subsidies and allowed to compensateopetating cost of non-economic routes. However, private busoperators had to face the disadvantage arising from low fhres.Taking this into consideration, a new bus fare policy wasadopted in2002 for private and public bus services to replacead hoc fare revisions. under this, fares are to be determined ona cost based formula. The National Transport Commission(NTC), the regulatory authority for passenger transportationunder the central government, monitors the formula, carryingout surveys every year to ascertain changes in the costcomponents. In terms of the bus fares policy, bus fares wereincreased by l5 per cent in July 2003.The overall performance of the road passenger busservices, in terms of fleet renerval, operated kilometerage andpassenger kilometerage, reflected a setback dur.ing 2003. Thetotal bus fleet declined in 2003 due to drop in RTC bus fleet,although private bus operators increased their fleet. The

average number ofbuses operated per day by both sectors alsodropped. However, in terms of vehicle utilisation, on average,an RTC bus ran 200 kilometers per day while a privateoperator's bus ran 132 kilometers per day indicating thatprivately owned buses are under-utilised due to the single crelvsystem. The load factor of RTCs buses remained at 105,compared to 150 for private buses, refiecting that buses in bothsectors are over crowded, During the year, the total operatedkilometerage by RTCs and private operators declined by 5 percent, the net result of a l5 per cent decline in RTC busoperations and I per cent increase in private bus operations.Reflecting the same trend, overall passenger kilometer.sdeclined by 5 per cent.

The consolidated expenditure of RTCs in 2003 dropped by5 per cent to Rs.10,957 million, whereas revenue dropped byl0 per cent to Rs. 8,396 million, excluding reimbursementreceived from the Treasury. As a result, RTCs, reported aRs.2,561 million loss against the Rs. 2,lgi million ]oss reportedrn 2002. During the year, a sum of Rs.255 million was releasedto the SLCTB to be disbursed among the RTCs for theoperation of 2,186 uneconomic rural bus services.

Bus service in the North (Jaffna Peninsula) had not been

operated since June 1990 to 1996 due to the security situation,

resultin-q in about 1.000 redundancies. Buses and buildingsbelonging to SLCTB depot in the North wete completely

damaged. Howevet, in May 1996, bus services resumed, which

led to the recruitment of a considerable number of statf and

crew. Currently, the NoLth Region Transpolt Boarrd (NRTB)

depots in Jaffna, Point Pedro, Kalainagar and Mannar areoperating on average about 115 buses daily' earning

approximately Rs.16 million per month with 32,000 operated

kilometers. The Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu depots have not

been functioning since 1990, due to the prevailing security

situation in this area.

The government's policy to improve efficiency in RTCs

is to establish private-public partnerships. In 2002. PERC

called for Expressions of Interest from private investors to

acquire 39 per cent equity in I I RTCs. Subsequently, a plivate

consortium was selected to divest six RTCs in 2003' However,

the Cabinet of Ministers later cancelled the divestment. PERC

has now commenced calling for new tenders tbr all 13 stlte

owned bus companies.

The legistration of motor vehicles at the Department of

Motor Traffic (DMT) increased substantially, by 60 per cent,to 181,500 during 2003, following a 56 per cent growth in

2002.lmprovements in economic activities and income levels

and a reduction in the import surcharge from 40 per cent to 20

per cent helped to increase motol'vehicle re-eistrations in recent

yeal's. The legistration of all types of motor vehicles increased;

registration of three wheelers and motorcycles incleased by 73

per cent and 54 per cent, r'espectively.During the yeat, DMT introduced several measures toimprove the efficiency of operations relating to vehicle

registration, change of ownership and issue of driving licences

through computerisation, One day services have also beenintroduced. As a result, registration of a vehicle can be

accomplished within 24 hours. Similarly, vehicle transfers

could be done within the same day. Some services, such as

registration of motorcycles, have been decentralised.

Railway Transportation

Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) had been operating as a government

department since 1902 till July 2003. Prior to I902 rail services

\\'ere managed by the Ceylon Railway Company registered in

1845.r The primary objective of the SLR was to provide and

operate rail services in the country fbr the efficient can'iage of

-uoods and persons. Holvever, the contribution of railway

services to the country's overall passenger and freight

transportation has not significant, particularly in recent years.

At present, the share in the passenger and freight transportation

was approximately 8 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively. Its

share in the Colombo suburban areas, however, is important'Insufficient investment on track maintenance, lack of

locomotives and compartments, weak signaling systems,

management deficiencies, overstaffing and irrational fare

policies have contributed to the deterioration of rail services in

the country.All attempts made to revitalize the rail service within the

framework of a government department failed. Subsequently,

it had been recognised that the shortcomings in the SLR should

be resolved by transforming the Department to an Authority,

as this would provide flexibility in decision making, enableoperation as a commercially viable entity and enhance

opelating efficiency and reduce the burden on the government

budget. Consequently, in 1993, the Sri Lanka Railway

Authority Act No 60 was passed, but did not come in to effectuntil the Gazette notification issued by the Minister of

Transport, Highways and Civil Aviation on 23 July 2003.Holever, according to the Gazette notification No. 1298122,

the operation of Section II of the Act, relating to the employees

of the SLR was postponed.

There was no noteworthf improvement in the rail servicesin terms of train operations, revenue, new investments or

quality of the services. In fact, they deteriorated further during

2003. At end 2003, the SLRA owned only l30locomotives and

power sets for daily operations, although it needed 153

locomotives to meet the demand. The old and obsolete natureof existing rolling stock, decaying rail tracks and outdatedsignaling system have adversely affected the provision of

satisfactory rail services. There were 255 derailments and 585

locomotive failures in 2003, compared with 104 derailments

and 620locomotive failures in 2002- The punctuality of rail

services measured by on time arrival and departures further

deteriorated in 2003.Despite the resource constraints, the operated train

kilometers remained at 8 million kilometers, approximately the

same level as in 2002. The passenger kilometerage increased

by 4 per cent to 4,258 million, while goods transportation

dropped by 2 per cent to 129 million kilometers' The increase

in passenger kilometerage was largely due to relatively very

low passenger fares maintained by SLRA. As passenger fares

126Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2003

Pad IChapter 5 - ECONOMTC AND SOCTAL OVERHEADS

have been raised from I March 2004, passenger kilometerageare likely to decrease unless services are improvedsubstantially.

The total revenlle of SLRA declined by 3 per cent. due toa decrease in income fi'om goods and other revenue. operatingexpenditure increased by 2 per cent, resulting fr.om increasesin the price of fuel. consequently, the operating loss of theSLRA increased by 5 per cent to Rs.2,063 million in 2003.The SLRA continued development and improvementactivities of the railway system during 2003. As part of theproject to duplicate the Coast Line from panadura toAluthgama the second track from wadduwa to Kalutara Northwas completed during the year, while project two of phase IIof the installation of colour Light Signaling System continuedduring the period. Private sector assistance was obtained inmaintaining buildings and premises of railway stations atColombo Fort, Kompannavidiya and Maradana.The total employment of SLRA stood 16,422 at end 2003.In addition there were 1,104 casual labourers. The SLRA hasoffered a number of schemes including a voluntary retirementscheme (vRS) with a view to developing the human resourcesof SLRA.

Civil Aviation

As the global civil aviation industry began to recover from thesevere setback resulting from the tenorist attack on the worldTrade center in New York on ll september 2001 and theglobal economic slow-down, it was affected by the Iraq warand sARS epidemic in 2003. However, the industry registereda moderate recovery in 2003. In sri Lanka the civil aviationsector continued to recover from the attack on the BandaranaikeInternational Airport (BIA) in July 200r, with the benefit of theceasefire and peace negotiations. The ongoing ceasefire andrecovery in the global economy rapidly expancled touristarrivals, exceeding the target of 500,000 tourists. This was amajor factor that contributed towards improving the civilaviation sector in the country during 2003.Following the world trend of liberalisation and de_regulation in civil aviation, Sri Lanka too increasedliberalisation. Accordingly, the Department of civil Aviationwas converred to the civil Aviarion Authority (cAA) of SriLanka on 27 December 2002 under the Civil AviationAuthority Act No. 34 0f 2002. As 2003 was rhe first year ofexistence of the cAA, the Authority mainly dealt with itsinstitutional affangements such as staffing, acquisition of basicfacilities, development of internal management policies,finding revenue sources and the establishment of its role andidentity. The cAA is a self-financed organisation. Its primarysource of income is the surcharge levied on airline tickets, In2003, the cAA earned Rs.l28 million, while total expenditurewas Rs.58 million, resulting in Rs.46 million of operatingprofits. As one of its primary functions, the CAA maintainssafety standards through safety registration. The year 2003 wasnoted as an accident free year, with only a very few incidents.one of the noticeable shifts initiated by the cAA was the move

towards public plivate partnerships (ppp) in aviationinfrastructure management in SLi Lanka, under whichmanagement of airports and pr.ovision of air navigationfacilities and services would be cau'ied out with pr-ivate sectorparticipation.During 2003,40 international aiLlines, including g cargoairlines, operated in Sri Lanka, compared to Zl airlines,including 5 cargo airlines, in2002. The number of passengerswho passed through BIA increased by l6 per cent to 3.4 millionin 2003 from 2.9 million in2002. Of the toral air passengers,58 per cent traveled by the national carrier whereas in 2002 theshare was 60 per cent. The total fieight tonnage handled at BIAincreased by 5 per cent to 124 million metric tons. Of this, 57per cent was on Srilankan Airlines (SLA). SLA commencedan air taxi service in December 2003. from Colombo to majortourist destinations such as Kandy, Koggala, Bentota,Trincomalee, Anuradhapura and Hinguraggoda. The air taxihas already become popular among local and foreignholidaymakers and businessmen, Three domestic privateaillines operated in 2003, carrying 86,388 passengers, against41,034 canied in2002.During 2003, there were 9 Airbuses in the SLA fleetthough it had 12 Airbuses before the terrorists attack in Juty200I.In 2003, SLA flew 49,144 hours and 6.926 millionpassenger kilometers against 41,935 hours and 6,180 millionpassenger kilometers in 2002, increase of l7 per cent and l2per cent, respectively. The financial performance of SLAimproved in2003 compared with2002. Revenue increased by24 per cent to Rs.38,841 million, while operating expenditureincreased by 21 per cent to Rs,38,433 million. As a result, SLAreported Rs.408 million operational profits before tax, incontrasl to a Rs,524 million loss in the previous year.During 2003 BIA handled 2l,g3l aircraft, I I per centhigher than 2002.It is expected that the capacity fbr aircrafthandling and passenger movements would increase at BIA withthe completion of the new airport development programme.The proposed Phase II of the airport development project aimsto expand the capacity with modern passenger facilities.The airline industry in the region is expected to growrapidly and become highly competitive, and that BIA willemerge as a regional hub, given its geographical locationbetween Singapore and Dubai. Several measures that need tobe implemented to meet this demand in the future have beenidentified. Accordingly, CAA has initiated to promote theopen-sky policy that will be fully effecrive from July 2005 andwill allow foreign airlines to operate commercial air services.In addition, Airport and Aviation Services (SriLanka) Ltd. hasproposed to expand the departure public concourse, the arrivalpublic concourse, develop transit hotel and construct a multistorey car park. The settlement of civil disturbance andpotential development of tourism in the country wouldconsiderably intensify domestic air travelwhich would requiredevelopment of domestic airports. At present, the alternativeinternational airport at Wellawaya is under Cosideration.

Port Services

Port operations improved further in 2003 after a strong

recovery in2002.lmproved world trade, the rapidly improvingIndian economy and the faster recovery in Asian economies

helped improve port operations. Productivity improvements,

capacity expansion and effective promotional schemes also had

a positive impact on the port services.Container throughput handled at the Port of Colomboduring 2003 increased by I I per cent. This is the highest ever

annual container throughput handled at the Port of Colombo.Reflecting a similar trend, transshipments and domestic

container handling at the Colombo Port rose by 12 and 8 per

cent, respectively, during 2003.Improved performance at the

Jaye Container Terminal (JCT) and South Asia Gatway

Terminals (Pvt) Ltd (SAGT) contributed equally to the growthof container handlins at the Colombo Port. The container

handling efficiency at the JCT improved satisfactorily due tovarious incentives and marketing strategies and a human

resource development programme. Total cargo handling, ofwhich 75 per cent is containerised, increased by 8 per cent

during the year.The number of ships arriving at the Port of Colombo

increased marginally by I per cent to 3,838 in 2003. However,

ship arrivals at Galle suffered a marginal decrease of 3 shipsto 73. The number of ships calling at Trincomalee port

decreased by 78 to LZl, mainly due to improved land transport

in the North and the East after the ceasefire. Accordingly, total

ship calls to all three ports decreased from 4,062 in 2002 to

4,032 in 2003.Productivity at the Port of Colombo during the last five

years has increased substantially. Net gantry moves (the

number of containers handled) per hour for main line ships rose

Housing

According to the Ministry of Housing and plantationInfrastructure, the shortage of houses in Sri Lanka is around400,000 and is expected to increase to 650,000 units by 2010.A large number of existing housing unrts are considered to besubstandard and lack essential utility services and amenities.The government policy on housing is to create a conduciveenvlronment to mobilise credit and other forms of financing forhousing construction. The government has introduced anafTordable housing flnance scheme for low and middle incomegr0ups through financial institutions with a view roencouraging construction of private housing. under thisscheme, loans upto Rs.500,000 are granted at an interest rateof 9'5 per cent per annum.

A su'ge in construction and financing of housing was seenin 2003, benefiting from improved economic conditions,especially the low interest rate regime. A strong growth inlending by commercial banks and other financial institutionswas seen during the year. To meet the growing demand forhousing in and around colombo, particularly middle classhousing, a rapid expansion in construction of condominiumwns observed in 2003. According to housing financeinstitutions, construction of at least 125,000 housescommenced in 2003, reflecting a 33 per cent growth over thepreceding year,Total loan disbursements under NHDA housingprogrammes increased more than twofold to Rs.l,2 billion in2003' The number of housing units whose construction

Meanwhile, berth efficiency,measured as average berth stay, decreased from r3.4 hours in2002to 10.7 hours in 2003. Reflecting the same trend, port srayfor container vessels dropped to r2.i hours in2003 from l5.ghours in 2002.The major contributor to the improved performance of thecolombo Port is the JCT, which performed better with theintroduction of a set of reforms, including elimination ofspeedy money off'ered by the shipping agents, introduction ofa target bonus system based on container handring productivrty,and introduction of some werfare facirities irovided toemployees, As a result of these developments, the JCT was ableto enter into Terminal Services Agreements (TSA) with fivetop container lines to operate at JCT and attract some other newshipping services during the year,The financial performance of sLpA improved in 2003.Total revenue increased by 4 per cent to Rs.l6.4 bilrion. Theoperating expenditure decrined by 2per cenr to Rs.l2.6 biilion,excluding Rs' 2.5 bilrion of expenditure on voruntaryretirement scheme (vRS) int'oduced in that year. As a result,operating profit befbre tax and cost VRS incr-eased by 33 percent to Rs.3.9 billion during the year.with a view to placing SriLanka as the topmost mar.itimecenter in the South Asian region, the SLpA implementedseveral projecrs during the year. The North piei wideningproject that started in 1996 was completed and the widened pierwas opened in August2003.

Hambantota districts to reconstruct their houses. MFOR

continued implementing the Diyawara Gammana housing

programmes. During 2003, a total of l0 housing schemeswith 801 housing units were completed under this

programme. PHDT continued implementing several housing

construction and upgrading programmes in the estate sectorunder the Plantation Development Support Programme

(PDSP) in 2003. The new approach adopted in the plantation

areas for on-site relocation of line rooms with two storied

housing units with basic infrastructure facilities has created a

new demand for housing in the plantation sector.UDA has planned 10 housing schemes with 15,000

houses in Colombo and suburbs with all ancillary facilities.Of this, three housing projects with 500 units have already

commenced. These projects are expected to be completed by

2005. Real Estate Exchange (Pvt) Ltd (REEL) has signed anMOU with a private company in 2003 to construct 1,143 low

cost apartments with a total investment of Rs.1,984 million.REEL will own 358 housing units worth Rs.622 million inlieu of the land value and these will be distributed among

previous occupants of those lands. The Sustainable Township

Programme is being revitalised to expand the re-housing of

underserved communities in newly constructed housing

schemes with basic infrastructure facilities. Commercially

valuable lands freed up under this scheme will be utilised for

various development activities.The Housing Development Finance Corporation has

been converted to a fully fledged housing finance bank with

the objective of expanding housing finance activities and

mobilising financing resources from the capital market.SMIB, HDFC Bank and NSB, together, granted 28,289housing loans in 2003, in comparison to 25,122 in 2002.Meanwhile, several commercial banks, namely, BOC, PB,HNB, Seylan Bank and Commercial Bank, together, granted

86,967 housing loans in 2003, which reflects a 59 per cent

growth over 2002. The total loan amount granted was around

Rs. 85 billion.

Urban Development

The urban population and urban centres emerging throughout

the country are major driving forces of expansion for the

services sector. The urban population is on the rise and will go

up to 40-50 per cent of the total population by 2025. Urban

development is partly a public good, which needs public

financing whenever private investments are not forthcoming.

In Sri Lanka, a lack of funding available for urban development

has created a series of difficulties in the areas of urban housing,

transportation, congestion, urban health and environment' Most

urban centres in the country are experiencing inadequate

economic and social infrastructure, envitonmental and waste

disposalproblems, urban poverty and unemployment. An urban

sector policy framework has been proposed for Sri Lanka with

the objective of facilitating an integrated, sustainable and

equitable urban development by the government.

The Urban Development Authority (UDA) plays acrucial

role in planning and executing urban development projects inthe country with the participation of local government

authorities. UDA provides consultancy services to provincial

councils, local authorities and other organisations with regardto urban planning and development. Key obstacles to

expanding urban services have been the lack of space and

financial resources. In this respect, unproductive and vacanteed to be identified for systematicctor participation in the developmentneeds to be encouraged to addressI issues.The main operational activities of uDA include theconstruction of administrative complexes, commercialcomplexes, town improvement projects, industrial projects,integrated projects and social and cultural projects. The-mainprojects operated under the purview of the uDA in 2003included work on the Beira Lake Redevelopment project,construction work ar the Information Technology (IT) park atMalabe, the Galle Face Green Redevelopment project andconstruction of a bus stand in Nuwara Eliya. In addition, uDAimplemented several projects on behalf of public sectorinstitutions and continued to maintain the Land Bank. The totalexpenditure on the implementation of these programmesamounted to Rs.466 million, a decline of 3 per cent from theprevious year. The sources of funds for these projects were theper

Water Supply

The proportion of households with access to an improved watersources is about 70 per cent and of that, only about 3 I per centhave access to pipe bome water. The demand for pipe bornewater is growing, in line with population growth, increasedurbanisation and the expansion of commercial and industrialactivities. The supply of water needs to be expanded to meetboth current and future demand, which is a challenging task.one of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) declaredby the united Nations, requires all citizens to have access rosafe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities by 2025.The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB)intends to provide access to safe drinking water for the entirepopulation and adequate sanitation facilities for all by 2010.However, the estimated investment needed to achieve this goal,at Rs.85 billion (Rs.l0-12 billion per year) is in excess ofavailable funding. The average value of investments by thegovernment in recent years has been around Rs.7 billion. Thus.

private sector and community participation are essential tomeet the required investment.NWSDB managed 280 water supply schemes with782,124 water connections in 2003. The total volume of warersupplied by NWSDB increased marginally from 350 millioncubic meters in2002 to 357 million cubic meters in 2003. Thenumber of new connections provided by NWSDB decreased by27 per cent to 49,789 in 2003. The percentage of non-revenuewater (system loss) increased from 3l per cent in 2002 to 35per cent in 2003. This illustrates the need for improving thedistribution network, stopping illegal and non-revenuegenerating water connections and giving immediate attentionto breakdowns.In 2003, NWSDB invested Rs.l0.2 billion in the watersupply sector, a sharp increase of25 per cent over the previousyear. Of the total investment,TT per cent was on new projects,while the balance was on the rehabilitation of existing projects.Foreign funding, on concessionary terms contributed to 67 percent of the total investment. NwsDB concessionary termscommenced the Secondary Towns water supply and sanitationProject covering both urban and rural areas at a cost of uSdollars 86 million. The small Towns water Supply project isone of the major projects implemented by the NWSDB withADB assistance to improve health and well being of onemillion people living in Anuradhapura, Hambantota, Kalutara,Kegalle, Monaragala and Puttalam districts through improvingwater supply and sanitarion facilities. The NWSDBimplemented 47 upgrading and rehabilitation projects at a costof Rs,6l I million during the year. An additional population of1,3 million will be benefited once rhese projects are completed.The Towns North of Colombo Water Supply project was inprogress with financial assistance from JBIC. The totalestimated cost of the project is Rs,5 billion, A population of350,000 will be benefited once the project is completed. Inaddition, NWSDB implemented several water supply prqectsincluding the Nuwara Eliya Water Supply AugmentationProj ect, Nawal api ti ty al AmparalKoggal a Water S upply proj ect,Greater Kandy and Greater Galle Water Supply projects andthe Kalu Ganga Water Supply Project in2003.Further, NWSDB implemented a project aimed atreducing non-revenue water distribution in Colombo. Underthe project, the water distribution network is expected to beimproved while providing direct water connections tohouseholds in low income resettlements, instead of throughnon-revenue generating public stand posts. With a view topromoting public private partnerships, two pilot projects,namely, the Greater Negombo and Kalutara to Galle waterdistribution schemes, have been identified for private sectorparticipation. In this respect, feasibility studies have beencarried out and pre-qualification documents for private sectorparticipation were under preparation.The total revenue of NWSDB increased by 6 per cent toRs. 4,864 million in 2003, This increase in revenue was larselv

due to the expansion in the consumer network. There were notariff revisions in 2003. NWSDB reported a net operatingprofit of Rs.278 million in 2003, compared to Rs,I 12 millionrn 2002, which is negligible compared with the required

financial resources for maintenance and new investment.

Samurdhi Programme

The Samurdhi programme is to be streamlined in terms of

the provisions stipulated in the Welfare Benefit Act (WBA)

passed in 2002. The law clearly indicates the eligibilitycriteria and screening process for beneficiaries to enroll in theprogramme. A task force has been set up to monitor theimplementation of these reforms. Prior to implementation of

the provisions of the WBA, a pilot project was caruied outcovering urban, rural and estate sectors in several districts.

The reforms are expected to be implemented from 2005. It isexpected that assistance under Samurdhi will be targeted

better with the implementation of the WBA.The Samurdhi programme has been the single largest

welfare programme in the country since its inception in 1995.A totalof 1.5 million families (excluding tamilies receiving Rs,

140) benefited directly under the income supplementaryprogramme implemented under Samurdhi. This indicates thatnearly 33 per cent of the total population was receiving

assistance under Samurdhi in 2003. However, as per the

Household Income and Expenditure Survey-2002, conductedby the Department of Census and Statistics, the percentage of

poor households in Sri Lanka was 23,9 per cent.r This survey

also revealed that 18, I per cent of non-poor households are

receiving Samurdhi, Though the provisions of the WBA havenot yet been implemented, owing to various stricter controls

and empowerment programmes, the number of Samurdhibeneficiaries declined in 2003. The total outlay for thisprogramme dropped by 18 per cent to Rs. 7,966 million in2003. This excludes 383,783 families, who were virtuallyretired from income supplementary programme but werereceiving Rs.l40 per month to keep them involved in othercommunity development programmes and to pay the social

security premium and contribution to the compulsory savingsfund. In addition to the income supplementary programme,

222,652 families received benefits under the dry ration scheme

implemented for the benefit of internally displaced families at

a cost of Rs.1,,228 million. Meanwhile, nutrition allowance

cards, valued at Rs. 177 million were issued to 90,866 families,

during 2003. The total cost of the entire Samurdhi programme

I Those households spending more than 50 per cent of theexpenditure on food and average adult equivalent foodexpenditure is less than Rs.1 ,378.48 per adult per month areconsidered as poor households.

unsustainable expansi on of economic activities, par-ti cul arlyagricultural activities and industries, has an adverse impact onthe environment. Striking a balance beti.veen the consumptionof natural resources and development has been a challen_eefaced by the authorities. The protection of the environment hasbeen recognised as an integral component of the clevelopmentprocess and any breakdown in environmental stability wouldin turn, have serious implications on development. Retbr-ms,the rnarket mechanism and the use of economic instr-uments fbr-environmental regulations have ploved etl'ective in managingthe environment.

The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources(MENR), the leading policy making institution responsible forthe plotection and development of the natural environment inthe country, has identifled flve major environmental issues inthe country. They are; land degradation due to soil erosion, lossof biodrversity, waste disposal problems, water pollution anddepletion of coastal resources. In 2003 . MENR formulated theNational Environmental Policy (NEp), with a view toaddressing those issues and managing the environment on asustainable basis.In terms of NEP, MENR prepared a National policy oncleane. Production and Strategy to minimise environmentpollution flom industries. The Biodiversity Secretariat of theMinistry initiated fbrmulating a National Biodiversity policytbr SLi Lanka. In order to address the issue of an incretrsingtrend in arr pollution due to vehicle emissions, standards wereimposed on tuel and vehicle imports fr-om July 2003.MENR has taken several steps to impr.ove bio_technology, bio-saf-ety and genetic diversity in the country. Inthis respect, a programme for the conservatron and commercialscale production of red sandlewood planting materials wasinitiated as a special ploject. Further, with the assistance of theUnited Nations Environmental programme (UNEp) and theGlobal Environment Facility Project (GEFP), the developmentof a National Biodiversity Framework for Sri Lanka waslaunched in 2003.With a view to prevenring and mitigating the level ofpollution, the Ministry implemented several plo,qrammesdurin-e 2003. The 'Pavithra Ganga' programme was continuedto monitor the water quality of inland water bodies. TheMinistry continued to co-o'dinate the implementation of theNational Strategy for Solid Waste Management programme.The approval of the Cabinet of Ministers was obtained tornvolve the plivate sector in solid waste management. MNREcontinued tcl co-ordinate intemational treaties, such as the BasleConvention on the Transboundary Movements of Hazardouswastes and Disposal, the Stockholm convention on persistenrorganic Pollutants and the United Nations convention onCombat Desertification.

The Centlal Environment Author-ity (CER), the regulatorin the environment sector, processed 2l Environmental ImpactAssessments (EIA) in respect of various projects during 2003.It conducted 22lnitial Environmental Examinations (rEE) and

,eranted approval fbr l6 projects. Under the Natural ResourcesManagement and Monitoring Project, CEA conducted 37gexaminations in 2003. In addition, CEA issued Ig7Environment Protection Licences (EPL) in 2003.CEA continued monitoring the discharge of etfluents, airand noise emissions and waste water samples in order tomiti_qate environment pollution.

measured values of sulpher dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and

carbon monoxide throughout the year at selected locations.CEA continued to monitor the water quality of majorinland water bodies in the country during 2003. Accordingly,the water quality in the Kandy Lake, the Kelani River andBeira Lake was monitored on a regular basis, in order todetect pollution trends. CEA analysed 347 surface watersamples and 40 ground water samples in 2003. Public.complaints under the Industrial Environmental Pollution andViolation of National Environmental Act increased. During

2003,1,618 complaints were received by CEA compared to

1,242 complaints in 2002.

Disposal of solid waste is a chronic problem, especially in

urban areas and needs concerted effort for reduction. CEA

implements the Solid Waste Management (SWM) Programme,

under which it issues site clearance certificates for projects

proposed by local government authorities and NGOs regarding

the dumping of solid waste and for projects on composting.CEA also conducted environmental education and awareness

programmes among school children, teachers, and the general

public at district level.
