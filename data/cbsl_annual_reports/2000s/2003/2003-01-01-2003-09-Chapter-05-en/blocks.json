    "text": "The quality and coverage of the available physical and socialinfrastructure supported by an efficient and effective regulatorysystem constitute the crucial factors for creating a conduciveinvestment climate in a country. However, as common to manydeveloping countries, Sri Lanka is in need of substantialimprovement in infrastructure facilities. The development ofinfrastructure responds positivery to liberalisation, derigulationIn some sectors and private sector participation as has beenexperienced in other countries. sri Lanka is not an exceptionto this general rule. The need for creating a conduciveenvironment for infrastructure development in sri Lanka hasbeen identified, but a vigorous pursuit of this goal has not beenfollowed adequately or continuously.Many enterprises supplying infrastructure services areowned by or remain monopolies of the government. Servicesrendered by many of these are below the expected servicenorms, while being unviable and therefore dependent ongovernment assistance, although they could be profitably run.To address these issues and improve the investment climate ofthe country, a wide range of reforms has already beensuggested and some are being implemented in areas such aselectricity, petroleum, passenger transportation, airtransportation, telecommunications, postal services, and portservices. The common features of these reforms are that: thesupply of services should be on a competitive basis; servicesshould be provided at affordable and cost effective prices; andbe operated by public-private parrnerships (ppp). with privatesector participation, inefficient public sector enterprises areexpected to operate efficiently under self-financingmechanisms, thereby reducing the burden on the state. otheradvantages ofPPP include expansion ofservices, risk transferfrom the public sector to the private sector and possibility ofadopting international best practices in terms of technologiesand managerial skills. Further, it would promote Iocalentrepreneurship and help deepen the local capital market.The government has a major role to play under ppp,",

A third player in importing anddistributing petroleum products is expected to commenceoperations in 2004.In the petroleum sector, a common userfacility company, ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Ltd(CPSTL) to manage key petroleum infrastructure such as oilterminals, storage facilities and pipelines, was set up.

However, CEB faced a severecapacity shortage in the latter part of 2003 due to the drop inreservoir water levels, as there were no adequate alternativeenergy sources. Due to the high cost of power generation,CEB's financial position continued to be weak in 2003. Asolution to both inadequate capacity and high cost power is tosecure low cost large-scale power sources such as coal poweras early as possible. Though the system loss of the CEBdeclined slightly in 2003, it still remains high ar around 19 percent, requiring the power authorities to take appropriate actionto bring it down to an acceptable level.In terms of the Railway Authority of Sri Lanka Act No.60 of 1993, the sri Lanka Railway Department was convertedto an Authority in July 2003. In the new structure, rail servicesare expected to operate in a commercially viable manner,thereby reducing the burden on the budget. However, due toresistance fiom unions, a noteworthy improvement could notbe made in the rail services, except for the implementation ofthe fare revision. Air transportation revived with the increasein tourism, recovery in the world aviation industry, negotiationswith a number of countries to increase the number of servicesas well as destinations and reforms in the institutional structureby establishing the Civil Aviation Authoriry of Sri Lanka(CAASL) in place of the Department of Civil Aviation.The reforms in the telecommunications sector continuedin 2003.

Fulther, therewere 49 public Ayurvedic hospitals with 2,567 beds.Accordingly, the number of beds per 1,000 persons has beenestimated to be 3.8 at end 2003. The number of qualifiedmedical officers in the public health services increased by 12per cent to 8,342.It has been estimated that there were about800 qualified doctors in private practice, Accordingly, thenumber of persons per doctor dropped to 2,104 at end 2003. Inaddition, there were 1,289 Assistant Medical practitioners(AMPs) attached to government hospitals. The number ofnurses in government hospitals increased by 4 per cent to16,7 I I at end 2003. According to the Ministry of Health, therewere an estimated 8,000 qualified nurses attached to privatemedical institutions, thus increasing the number of nurses per100,000 persons to 123 at end 2003 fLom IZI ayear ago. Bothgovernment and private medical institutions suft'er from lackof trained health personnel particularly nurses and other para-medical staff. There are better employment opportunities in theforeign labour markets also for these categories of employment.Therefore, it is necessary to take appropriate measures toincrease training opportunities for health personnel in thecountry with the support of the private sector.The year 2003 was characterised by frequent disr-uptionsto the smooth conduct of public health services due to labourdisputes. The health sector lost a large number of mandays ofservice of medical officers and other health workers in 2003due to strikes, creating much hardship to patients. The disputeillustrates that key health workers were of the view that theywere inadequately compensated so that the return on theirinvestment is very low. In this case it would be difticult toretain skilled health workers in the system, while futureinvestments in the health profession also would be aff'ected. Atthe same time payment of a reasonable return on investmentalso would not be feasible within the existing fiamework undergovernment control.

The dependence on thestate sector solely for funding the universities withoutexploring alternative sustainable sources has created a majorimpediment for the university system to keep pace with thedevelopments in the rest of the world. To complicate thematter, an unsalutory development has been the occunence offrequent student disputes that result in prolonged closure ofuniversities, thereby reducing the number of effectiveacademic days. As a consequence, the universities have notbeen able to follow a pre-announced academic calendar as isbeing followed by universities in the rest of the world,including neighbouring India, The failure to complete a pre-announced academic programme coupled with diminishedmorale of students due to uncertainty, substantially reducedthe quality of the graduates, as experienced by manyprospective employers who in turn have expressly preferredprofessional qualifications in the young employed overacademic qualifications.A sad observation has been that student leaders and manyuniversity academics who appear in public fora seen to beoblivious to this alarming development. Instead of creating apositive mind-frame in students, the blame for the plight in thepublic university system is squarely placed on elsewhereleading to violent uprisings in the universities that destroy thetrue academic spirit that should prevail for intellectualadvancement. It is therefore, high time for all stakehorders inthe university education viz., academics, students and taxpayersto initiate a conflict resolution process to search for answers forthe deepening crisis in the system.The private sector is mainly engaged in the provision ofprof-essional education, particularly in the areas of accountancy,management and information technology. Although there areprovisions in the existing Universities Act No. l6 of 1978 torecognise degree courses conducted by private institutions, theprocess for this is not clear. The University Grants Commissron(UGC) has granted degree-awarding status to conduct someparticular courses. Meanwhile, some private institutionsconduct courses leading to degrees in collaboration withfbLeign universities. However, it is expected that the quality andmarket relevance of degree programmes conducted by publicand private universities will be improved in an competitiveenvrronment.In addition to state-run universities, there are several otherpublic and private institutions, which conduct courses mainlyrelating to information technology and some other professionarsubjects. The Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technologyenrolled 2,700 new students to its IT based courses, Newadmissions to courses in the Open University were 11,000 in2003.In addition, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of SriLanka, the National Institute of Business Management, and theSri Lanka Law College were the major providers ofplofessional education.",

Thesubscriber network for fixed access and mobile cellularservices grew by 29 per cent compared to 2l per cent in2002. The growth reflects the sharp expansion in the mobilecellular market, which grew at 50 per cent in 2003. The mainfactors behind this rapid growth have been liberalisation,private ownership and increased competition. The subscriberbase of fixed access telephones increased by I per cent to939,013 in 2003.The Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of SriLanka (TRCSL) introduced three major reforms in 2003,namely, opening up of the external gateway for competition,introduction of l0 digit numbering system, and the completionof the fifth and final tariff re-balancing of the Sri LankaTelecom (SLT). Opening of external gateway operationsterminated the monopoly enjoyed by SLT. As a result, 32licences were issued to private parties to operate externalgateways by end 2003, and it resulted in a reduction ofinternational direct dialing (IDD) call charges by over 50 percent since March 2003.IDD calls also grew considerably andthe number of subscribers for IDD facilities provided by SLTalone increased by 25 per cent, The final tariff re-balancing, asstipulated in the shareholders' agreement signed by theGovernment of Sri Lanka (GOSL) and Nippon Telegraph andTelephone Corporation of Japan (NTT) in Augusr 1997,removed the cross subsidy from international calls to local calls",

Out of the total fixed access phones, 45 per cent werein the Colombo Metropolitan area at end 2003. Developmentof telecommunications, especially in rural areas, is very muchdependent on the use of radio frequency spectrum, Radiofrequency spectrum is needed in increasing quantities by WLLtelephones and cellular mobile operators, broadcasters, civilaviation authorities, the military, police and securityorganisations, government departments and some privateinstitutions. The new generation of wireless mobile servicesrefened to as Universal Mobile Telephone Services (UMTS)or Third Generation also requires new allocation of spectr-um.Managing the use of this scarce resource among thesecompeting uses is the main responsibility of the TRCSL.To expedite the supply of telecommunication facilities inrural areas, the TRCSL introduced a subsidy scheme in 1999,under which a subsidy is paid to payphone operators, whoinstall payphones in rural areas. TRCSL has gradually raisedthe subsidy amount from Rs.50,000 to Rs.75,000 per payphoneinstallation. Furthermore, the maximum number of eligibleinstallations was raised to 175 from an initiar 25 installationsper distnct, per operator.A number of projects were in progress to improvetelecommunication facilities in the North and the East, Aproject to establish a link between Sri Lanka and India wascompleted in 2003. It connected the two countries by amicrowave link between Talaimannar and Rameswaram inIndia.

The postal infrastructure in Sri Lankais one of the largest networks of service delivery systems in thecountry, with great potential to serve the public better with amultitude of products. The network could harness the potentialof rapidly growing information technology industry indelivering a wider anay of services. The postal service couldprovide newer services, such as electronic money transfer,insurance and pension related services, utility bill payments ande-government services, especially where those services are notcurrently available, A hindrance to such developments in theservice is due to the structural set up of the Postal Department,which does not allow full scale adoption of such services in acost eff'ective manner. Therefore, it is necessary to introducebroad-based institutional reforms and service modernisation inthe postal service in the country. The Postal Reform Billprovides the required legal statute and basic framework forsuch modernisation. However, it has not yet been implemented.The netwolk expanded slightly to 4,680 post offices in2003 from 4,616 in 2002. With the objective of providing awider range of services especially to rural areas,'communication locales' were introduced in 2002.

    "text": "As the global civil aviation industry began to recover from thesevere setback resulting from the tenorist attack on the worldTrade center in New York on ll september 2001 and theglobal economic slow-down, it was affected by the Iraq warand sARS epidemic in 2003. However, the industry registereda moderate recovery in 2003. In sri Lanka the civil aviationsector continued to recover from the attack on the BandaranaikeInternational Airport (BIA) in July 200r, with the benefit of theceasefire and peace negotiations. The ongoing ceasefire andrecovery in the global economy rapidly expancled touristarrivals, exceeding the target of 500,000 tourists. This was amajor factor that contributed towards improving the civilaviation sector in the country during 2003.Following the world trend of liberalisation and de_regulation in civil aviation, Sri Lanka too increasedliberalisation. Accordingly, the Department of civil Aviationwas converred to the civil Aviarion Authority (cAA) of SriLanka on 27 December 2002 under the Civil AviationAuthority Act No. 34 0f 2002. As 2003 was rhe first year ofexistence of the cAA, the Authority mainly dealt with itsinstitutional affangements such as staffing, acquisition of basicfacilities, development of internal management policies,finding revenue sources and the establishment of its role andidentity. The cAA is a self-financed organisation. Its primarysource of income is the surcharge levied on airline tickets, In2003, the cAA earned Rs.l28 million, while total expenditurewas Rs.58 million, resulting in Rs.46 million of operatingprofits. As one of its primary functions, the CAA maintainssafety standards through safety registration. The year 2003 wasnoted as an accident free year, with only a very few incidents.one of the noticeable shifts initiated by the cAA was the move",

    "text": "towards public plivate partnerships (ppp) in aviationinfrastructure management in SLi Lanka, under whichmanagement of airports and pr.ovision of air navigationfacilities and services would be cau'ied out with pr-ivate sectorparticipation.During 2003,40 international aiLlines, including g cargoairlines, operated in Sri Lanka, compared to Zl airlines,including 5 cargo airlines, in2002. The number of passengerswho passed through BIA increased by l6 per cent to 3.4 millionin 2003 from 2.9 million in2002. Of the toral air passengers,58 per cent traveled by the national carrier whereas in 2002 theshare was 60 per cent. The total fieight tonnage handled at BIAincreased by 5 per cent to 124 million metric tons. Of this, 57per cent was on Srilankan Airlines (SLA). SLA commencedan air taxi service in December 2003. from Colombo to majortourist destinations such as Kandy, Koggala, Bentota,Trincomalee, Anuradhapura and Hinguraggoda. The air taxihas already become popular among local and foreignholidaymakers and businessmen, Three domestic privateaillines operated in 2003, carrying 86,388 passengers, against41,034 canied in2002.During 2003, there were 9 Airbuses in the SLA fleetthough it had 12 Airbuses before the terrorists attack in Juty200I.In 2003, SLA flew 49,144 hours and 6.926 millionpassenger kilometers against 41,935 hours and 6,180 millionpassenger kilometers in 2002, increase of l7 per cent and l2per cent, respectively. The financial performance of SLAimproved in2003 compared with2002. Revenue increased by24 per cent to Rs.38,841 million, while operating expenditureincreased by 21 per cent to Rs,38,433 million. As a result, SLAreported Rs.408 million operational profits before tax, incontrasl to a Rs,524 million loss in the previous year.During 2003 BIA handled 2l,g3l aircraft, I I per centhigher than 2002.It is expected that the capacity fbr aircrafthandling and passenger movements would increase at BIA withthe completion of the new airport development programme.The proposed Phase II of the airport development project aimsto expand the capacity with modern passenger facilities.The airline industry in the region is expected to growrapidly and become highly competitive, and that BIA willemerge as a regional hub, given its geographical locationbetween Singapore and Dubai. Several measures that need tobe implemented to meet this demand in the future have beenidentified. Accordingly, CAA has initiated to promote theopen-sky policy that will be fully effecrive from July 2005 andwill allow foreign airlines to operate commercial air services.In addition, Airport and Aviation Services (SriLanka) Ltd. hasproposed to expand the departure public concourse, the arrivalpublic concourse, develop transit hotel and construct a multistorey car park. The settlement of civil disturbance andpotential development of tourism in the country wouldconsiderably intensify domestic air travelwhich would requiredevelopment of domestic airports. At present, the alternativeinternational airport at Wellawaya is under Cosideration.",
