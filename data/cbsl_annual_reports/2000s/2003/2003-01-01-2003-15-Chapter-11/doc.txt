PAYMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS

1L.L Payment and Settlement System

The national payment system consists of (i) a set of payment

instruments; (ii) individuals/corporates who function as payees,payers or financial intermediaries; (iii) procedutes, rules,

regulations and laws which provide a sound legal infrastructureto facilitate smooth transf'er of funds; and (iv) clearing andsettlement systems. An efficient and robust payment and

settlement system is vital for the development of the financial

system and also for maintaining tinancial system stability.The year 2003 witnessed the culmination of the CentralBank's move towards introducing technologically advancedpayment systems in Sri Lanka, a project which the Bank

started in 2001 under its modernisation programme. Underthis project, payments and settlements, which were hithertodone manually, were converted to a computer based RealTime Gross Settlement (RTGS) System; governmentsecurities, which were hitherto issued in scrip form, weremade scripless in a Scripless Securities Settlement (SSS)

System; and the Bank's own accounting system and treasurymanagement were automated by the installation of anAutomated General Ledger System (AGLS) and TreasuryDealing Room Management System (TDRMS). The SSSSystem and Central Depository System (CDS), which

maintained the records of government securities issued tnelectronic form. were brand-named as LankaSecure. TneRTGS system and LankaSecure were brand-named as'LankaSettle'. The RTGS System went live in September2003 and the other systems were inaugurated in early 2004.With a view to outsourcing non-core functions, the

Central Bank, in April 2002, divested its checlue clearing andoffline electronic payment system titled Sri Lanka InterbankPayment System (SLIPS) to a newly formed company,LankaClear (Pvt.) Ltd. (LankaClear) jointly owned by theCentral Bank and licensed commercial banks (LCBs).

LankaClear was expected to improve the efficiency of theclearing process of payment instruments by attracting new

management and technology and adopting a cost effectiveoperating system. As a way forward strategy, the CentralBank and LankaClear were making arrangements toimplement a Cheque Imaging/Truncation Project, which is

expected to be completed by end 2004. To overcome legal

constraints relating to retail payments and the acceptance ofelectronic presentment of cheques, the Central Bank hasinitiated action to introduce a payment transactions law,which is expected to be passed by Parliament in 2004.

Part IChapter 11 - PAYMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS

Given the wide preference for cash as a payment andsettlement instrument for retail level transactions of individualsand small scale entities, the switching over to non cash paymentinstruments has been slow, but it indicated an increasing trendin 2003. However, non cash payments continued to dominatein large value transactions in 2003.ll.2 Cash Payments

cunency notes and coins issued by the central Bank underthe provisions of the Monetary Law Act, No. 5g of Lg4g,continued to be the most popular retail payment mediumamong individuals and business entities to effect 'face toface' payments for transactions in acquiring goods, servicesand financial assets in 2003. In most institutions, salaries andwages were paid in cash despite the increased use of SLIpsfor salary payments and automated teller machines and debitcards for cash withdrawals. Indicating the dominance of cashin payments, the value of currency held by the publicincreased from Rs. 75 billion at end 2002 to Rs. g6 billion atend 2003, thus maintaining a currency to demand depositratio of 53:47.

11.3 Non Cash Payment Instruments

The major non cash payment instruments in use at end 200j,included:(i) Paper based instruments viz. cheques, drafts, bills ofexchange, and promissory notes; and(ii) Electronic payments effected thr.ough the RTGS Sysrem,debit/credit transfers in SLIpS, debit and credit cards,automated teller machines (ATMs), electronic fundtransfers at point of sale (EFTPOS), prepaid cards, andfund transfers through phone and Internet banking.

Paper Based Instruments

Cheques

The use of cheques for large value payments in inter-bankmoney, capital and securities markets decreased sinceSeptember 2003 as the participants in LankaSettle System, i.e.,LCBs and Primary Dealers (PDs) were not permitted to usecheques drawn on the Central Bank to settle their day-to-daypayments with the introduction of the RTGS System. TheGovernment and some government agencies, which maintained

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2OO3261

Part IChapter 11 - PAYMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS

current accounts with the Central Bank, continued to use

cheques drawn on the Central Bank. LankaClear clealed those

cheques,

Postal Instruments

The total value of payments made thlough local and foreignmoney orders and postal orders issued and settled by the

Department of Posts during 2003 amounted to Rs.l3 billion

compared to Rs. 9 billion in2002.

Electronic Payment Instruments

Direct Credit Transfers

Direct credit transfers were mainly used by corporate

customers. Customers of LCBs effected credit transfers throughwritten instructions as standing orders or electronically, byATMs, telephones or Internet. LCBs are permitted to makecross border credit transfers. The majority of cross bordertransactions are effected through correspondents'nostro'

accounts with foreign counterparties. In 2003, an LCB and a

non-bank company executed fast fund transfers in cooperationwith an international money transfer company incorporated in

the USA.

Direct Debit Transfers

Customers of LCBs used direct debit transfers to settle their

regular payments on utility services (viz. electricity, telephones

and water etc.), Ioan repayments, and dues on credit cards etc.

Such direct debits of bank customers were presented by LCBsin magnetic tapes/diskettes for clearing by LankaClear inSLPS. Direct debit transfers have shown a slow srowth inrecent years.

Credit Cards

Credit card, a 'settle later' type payment instrument, was themost widely used payment card for retail level transactionsduring the year under review. At end 2003,9 LCBs and a non-bank company had issued credit cards in Sri Lanka. Themajority of credit cards issued by LCBs are affiliated withVISA, MasterCard, or AMEX. At end 2003, the majority, i.e.,

79 per cent, of the total number of cards issued were globallyacceptable for payments. The total number of credit cards in

use, which showed a26per cent growthin2002, recorded anincrease of 24 per cent in 2003, due mainly to vigorouspromotional campargns of LCBs and increased banking habits.During 2003, the total number and value of financial

transactions billed under credit cards too showed a considerablegrowth and amounted to 7.7 million and Rs.23 billion

respectively,

Debit CardsDebit cards issued by LCBs were used for local andinternational payments, to check balances and for withdrawalof cash from accounts through an ATM or at an EFTPOS

terminal which had direct access to a Sri Lanka rupee or foreigncurrency account (current, savings, Non Resident Foreign

Currency Accounts etc.) of the cardholder. At end 2003, 4LCBs had issued Visa Electron cards and debit MasteCards.

Prepaid Cards

The use of prepaid cards also expanded substantially in the

recent past with the introduction of card-based networks by a

number of telephone companies.

Payment Cards Infrastructure

Automated Teller Machines (ATMs)

ATMs, which were introduced to Sri Lanka in 1986, have fast

become part of the cash system, while promoting effective cash

management. At end 2003, 14 LCBs and the National SavingsBank had installed 721 ATMs. The total number of financial

transactions effected through ATMs recorded a steady growth

and reached 34 million during 2003. The total value of financial

h'ansactions effected through ATMs during 2003 was Rs.l20billion against the comesponding value of Rs.72 billion in2002.

Electronic Fund Transfers at Point of Sale(EFTPOS)

EFTPOS, which was introduced to Sri Lanka in 1994, hasgradually become a substitute for cash and cheques. The totalnumber of EFTPOS machines installed in the country was

5,114 at end 2003 and the total volume of financial transactionseffected through EFTPOS during 2003 amounted to 8 million

compared to 6 million in2002. The total value of transactionsincreased by 26 per cent to Rs.31 billion in 2003 when

compared with 2002.

Phone/Nlobile/Tele-banking FacilitiesCustomers access for services under phone/mobile/tele-banking facilities included: balance inquiries; credit card

services; reporting of lost or stolen ATM cards and credit cards;

and infbrmation on banking services and products.At end 2003, nine LCBs provided phone/mobile/tele-

banking facilities to individual and corporate customers. Thequality of services and degree of utilisation of these servicesvaried from bank to bank depending on their business

strategies. The total number of bank customers registered to use

these services showed a significant growth of 50 per cent in2003 compared to the previous year. The total number offinancial transactions handled by phone/mobile/tele-bankingtoo showed an increase of 23 per cent. But the total value oftransactions handled through this medium recorded a

substantial drop from Rs.32 billion in 2002 to Rs.2 billion in

2003 due mainly to increased preference of some customers to

use the Internet for large value transactions.

Internet Banking

Internet banking commenced in Sri Lanka in 1999 to providebank customers with conventional banking services in aconvenient and efficient manner, The total number of bank

customers who enjoyed this facility reached 24,650 at end 2003while the total value of Internet banking transactions effectedduring 2003 increased by 39 per cent to Rs,81 billion.

ll.4 Interbank Clearing, Payment andSettlement Systems

During 2003, the following main inter-bank clearing, paymentand settlement systems were in operation.o Central Bank Cunent Account Settlement System;o Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) Sysrem;. Sri Lanka Interbank payment System (SLPS);. LankaClear Cheque Clearing Systems;. Regional Cheque Clearing System; ando US Dollar Cheque Clearing System.

Central Bank Current Account SettlementSystem

The central Bank current Account Settlement System was inoperation until the launching of the Real rime Gross SettlementSystem on 08 September 2003. It settled 103 milliontransactions amounting to Rs. lz,i50billion during the periodfrom 0l January to 05 September 2003.

Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System.

The RTGS System is a computer based direct credit transferand settlement system, which processes and settles eachpayment instruction immediately and irrevocably usingbalances in the settlement accounts of the participantsmaintained at the centralBank. The RTGS system settled largevalue and time critical payments in sri Lanka rupees betweendirect participating institutions (including the central Bank)and customer to customer through a direct participatinginstitution. They included transactions in the call market,govemment securities market, foreign exchange market (rupeeleg), Central Bank open market operations, inter-bank netclearing obligations/claims under cheque and SLIpS clearingsystems and regional cheque clearing conducted by the regionaloffices of the central Bank. The net clearing values of all retailpayment systems settled via the RTGS System amounted to Rs.142 billion or 3 per cent of the total value of the RTGStransactions during the period of 08 September to endDecember 2003. Participants of the RTGS System effectedsome of their customer payments, particularly time criticalpayments of corporate customers, through the RTGS System.The total volume of transactions settled by the RTGSSystem during the period from 08 September to end December2003 was 38,454 with a rotal value of Rs. 4,210 billion. Theaverage volume and value of transactions settled per day was499 and Rs, 55 billion respectively, The central Bank operaredas well as participated in the RTGS System. The otherparticipants were 22 LCBs,8 non-bank pDsr and theEmployees' Provident Fund (EpF).The highest number of transactions recorded during theperiod from September 08 to end December 2003 was 659and the highest value was Rs.9l billion. out of the total

transactions, 3,735 transactions (or l0 per cent) amounting toRs.799 billion (or l9 per cent) were Central Banktransactions. The daily behavior of the volume and value ofRTGS transactions is shown in Chart ll.l and Chart 11.2,respectively and the hourly distribution of the RTGStransactions on an average business day is shown in ChartI 1.3.The RTGS system settled mainly large value payments.Almost all transactions settled were above Rs. I million. Withthe implementation of the RTGS system, large-value same-day

Part IChapter 11 - PAYMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS

payments that were earlier cleared through SLIPS were shiftedto the RTGS System. There was a substantial drop in large

value SLIPS transactions particularly those of more than Rs. l0

million.The RTGS System allowed queuing of payment

instructions, i.e., a participant enters payment messages ln

advance pending incoming funds. During the period under

review, the proportion of queued transactions was small.

Intraday Liquidity Facility (ILF)

Having consideled the liquidity requirements of the RTGS

participants to effect payment instructions instantaneously, and

the importance of smooth operations of the system to achieve

its objectives, the Central Bank provided intraday liquidity

under the Intraday Liquidity Facility to the participants against

collateral of government securities and on an interest-free basis.

During the period from 08 September to end December 2003,

l7 participating institutions obtained ILF amounting to Rs.500

billion with a highest daily value of Rs'13 billion and a datly

average of Rs. 6.5 billion. As shown in Chart 11.4, ILF

obtained by participating institutions recorded a declining trend

over ttme.The additional liquidity created under ILF helped to

smoothen the settlement process of individual payments in the

RTGS System and allowed LCBs to further optimise theirliquidity management.

Sri Lanka Interbank Payment System (SLPS)

SLPS, which was introduced in 1994 and has been operating

as an offline inter-bank payment clearing system on

multilateral net settlement basis, continued clearing of the pre-

authorised low value bulk payments informed by participating

LCBs and the Central Bank in magnetic tapes/diskettes to

LankaClear. It facilitated LCBs, the Central Bank as well as

customers of LCBs to transfer funds by directly debiting the

respective account and crediting of an account of another

customer of another participating bank.

The total value of transactions cleared in SLIPS, which

recorded a 20 per cent drop tn2002, declined further by 27 per

cent to Rs.979 billion in 2003 as LCBs moved to settle their

'same day value' large inter-bank transactions in the RTGS

System. Accordingly, the share of large value (above Rs.l

mllion) transactions in the total number of transactions cleared

in SLIPS declined from L4 per cent in the first quarter of 2003

to 0.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2003. The total numberof direct credits, which were used mainly for payment of

salaries, dividends and pensions, continued to increase in 2003

but the total value continued to decline and reached Rs.979

billion in 2003.

LankaClear Cheque Clearing Systems

Main Cheque Clearing System

In terms of Section I l2(B) of the Monetary Law Act, the

Central Bank authorised LankaClear to provide cheque clearing

facilities viz. sorting, exchanging of articles (cheques or drafts)

among participating LCBs, balancing of amounts expressed in

those articles, calculating of net balances and providing suchinformation to the Central Bank and LCBs. The process

required physical movement of cheques' All LCBs and the

Central Bank participated in the main cheque clearing system

of LankaClear.The majority of cheques written against balances of rupee

accounts and drawn on LCBs were presented and cleared on

multilateral net settlement basis through the main cheque

clearing system operated by LankaClear. The sorting of

11.5 Securities Trading, Clearing andSettlement Systems

The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), the only stock

exchange in the country, operates an Automated Trading

System (ATS), which was inaugurated in 1997 for real time

trading of corporate equity and debt securities listed on CSE.CSE also commenced a Debt Securities Trading System(DEX) in June 2003r.At end 2003, there were 260 types of equities and 38 types

of corporate debt securities of companies listed on CSE' During

the year 2003, 254 types of equities and I9 corporate debt

securities were traded. The total value and volume of securities

transactions traded on the ATS recorded nearly a twofold

increase when compared with 2002 and amounted Rs.73.8billion and,2,225 million respectively during 2003. Trading inequity shares dominated as corp0rate debt securities

contributed less than one per cent in both the total value and

volume of securities transactions. Thcugh DEX has been in

operation since June 2003, there was no trading of government

securities in 2003. The types of securities eligible to be traded

in the DEX include the 'beneficial interest' of government

securities (Treasury bills and Treasury bonds), securities issued

by the Central Bank and corporate debt securities. Culrentlyonly 'beneficial interest' of government securities is being

traded in the DEX. Corporate debt securities listed on CSE will

also be traded through DEX shortly.

To encourage the development of the market tor difterent

types of securities, the Central Bank has taken a policy decision

to appoint the Central Depository Systems (Pvt.) Ltd. (CDS) of

the CSE as a direct participant in the LankaSettle System' CDS

is a fully owned subsidiary of CSE, that operates an electronic

clearing and settlement system for securities transactions

carried out through ATS and DEX.At end 2003, 32 organisations participated in the clearing

and settlement system. This included l5 stockbrokers and I7

custodian banks. Each securities ttansaction executed throughDEX has to be entered into the system through a stockbrokeror an exclusive trading member of DEX. However, only

stockbrokers are eligible to operate ATS for their clients.

Customers could operate CDS accounts through custodian

banks in addition to the above stockbrokers and trading

members, and custodian banks too participate in clearing

through CDS.Both ATS and DEX systems are diLectly connected to the

clearing and settlement system of CDS and matched trade

details are stored in CDS. Clearing and settlement of securities

traded in ATS are completed on real time by changing the title

of underlying securities in CDS. The settlement of tunds in

respect of equity transactions take place on the flfth working

day after the trade date (T+5) for the buyer and sixth working

day after the trade date (T+6) for the seller. The inter-

participant settlement also takes place on the sixth working day

after the trade date (T+6) through CDS. For corpot'ate debt

securities traded in the ATS, the settlement date for both seller

and the buyer is the first working day after the trade date (T+l).
