Chapter 7

POPULATION, LABOUR FORCE AND EMPLOYMENT

7.1 Overview

Population growth fell to 1.3 per cent in 2003 from 1.5 per

cent in the previous year. At the same time, the willingnessto get back to their original homes because of the peaceful

conditions that prevailed in the North and the East was evidentfrom the high in-migration to Batticaloa, Jaffna and

Trincomalee districts in 2003.Labour market developments in 2003 reflected the

expansion in domestic economic activities. Parallel with theoverall economic growth rate of 5.9 per cent, the

unemployment rate decreased, albeit marginally. The much

needed reform process to create a conducive environment foremployment creation in a more flexible labour market wasactivated durin-{ 2003. Accordingly, the reform process

culminated in the following legislation: amendments to theTermination of Employment of Workmen Act of I97l(TEWA), Industrial Disputes Act of 1950 (IDA), IndustrialDisputes-Hearing and Determination of Proceedings Act(IDA-Hearing) and Employment of Women, Young Persons

and Children Act of 1956 (EWYPCA) which were passed inParliament in January 2003. Early in the year, the Ministry

of Employment and Labour announced 3l December 2003 asthe date on which the TEWA, IDA and IDA-Hearing

amendment acts would come into operation. The tormula for

payment of compensation to all employees under the TEWA,which was a key ingredient of the amendment, was also

announced on 3l December 2003. Further, the implementationof JobsNet, an Employment Sourcing and Delivery System

that was conceptionalised in the Draft National EmploymentPolicy-2002 (DNEP) in 2003, was an important labour market

development towards reducing structural unemployment by

increasing the flow of information to market participants. This

is an on-line and service based employment delivery networkproviding a user-friendly interface between jobseekers andpotential employment, The JobsNet was operational fiom 1

May 2003 in 17 centres in the country and the expected targetsfor its first year were exceeded. (See Box l3)The government policy of limiting recruitment to thepublic sector was evident from the reduced number of

employees in the public sector estimated by the Annual Public

Sector Employment Survey (APSES) conducted by the CentlalBank of Sri Lanka. The shrinkage was mainly due to the

reduction of employment in semi-government institutions. Theintroduction of voluntary retirement schemes (VRS) underpublic enterprise reforms aimed at increasing efficiency andproductivity was the major reason for the reduction in

employment.

A break in the series of labour force statistics occunedat the beginning of 2003 with the inclusion of the EastemProvince in the l5-year Quarterly Labour Force Survey(QLFS) series conducted by the Department of Census andStatistics (DCS). This was possible due to the peaceful

conditions that prevailed in the North and the East as a result

of the continuation of the ceasefire in 2003. Consequently, the

unemployment rate repolted from the QLFS was 9.2 per centin the first quarter 2003 compared with 7.5 per cent in the

fburth quarter of 2002, as unemployment rates in the EasternProvince were found to be higher than in areas coveredpreviously. However, the unemployment rate for the wider

geographical coverage began declining towards the latter partof the year with employment generation mainly in theagriculture, construction and transport, storage andcommunication sectors. that was commensurate with the

economic growth seen in 2003 in those sectors.Foreign employment continued to increase in 2003 butat a slower rate compared to 2002. The reduction in thenumber of housemaids departing for foreign employment

resulted in this deceleration.

7.2 Population

According to the Registrar General's Department, the estimated

mid-year population grew by 1,3 per cent and stood at 19.3million in 2003. The peaceful atmosphere, which prevailed in

the North and the East due to the continuation of the ceasefire,

enabled people to return to their original homes after many

years, This was evident from the district population changes(Table 7.1) where the population migrated out of Mulaitivu,

Kilinochchi, Vavuniya and Mannar in to Jaffna, Trincomaleeand Batticaloa in 2003.The ageing of the population continues to be an importantdemographic factor in Sri Lanka that would impact on the long-term economic development of the country. This was evidentfrom the age distribution recorded during the census-2001 andfrom the provisional estimates for 2003. The population in theage group between 0-14 years grew by 1.2 per cent, which isbelow the mid-year population growth rate of 1.3 per cent in2003.In comparison, population in the age group of 55 yearsand over grew by 1.4 per cent.7.3 Labour Force

The labour force, which is defined as persons aged l0 years andabove, who are able and willing to work in a given referenceperiod, continued to increase during 2003 and rose to 7.61million in the third quarter of 2003 from 7.05 million in thethird quarter of 2002, an increase of 559,000. The increase inthe labour force for the conesponding period between 2001 and2002 was 320,000. Inclusion of the Eastern province from thebeginning of 2003 in the QLFS had a direct impact on the sharpincrease in the labour force, The increase also partly reflectsgreater willingness to engage in economic activity followingpositive expectations of economic recovery since 2001. Thelabour force consists of the employed and the unemployed. An

TABLE 7.1Population By District'000 PersonsDistrict 2001(a) 2OO22003(b) Change % Change

increase of 564,000 employed persons and decrease of 5,000unemployed persons contributed to the increase in the labourforce in 2003.Despite the absolute increase in the labour force, thelabour force participation rate, i.e,, the ratio of the labour forceto household population aged l0 years and above, including theEastern Province, fell to 48.6 per cent in the third quarter of2003 from 49.4 per cent (excluding Eastern province) in thethird quarter of 2002 due to a lower labour force participationrate in the Eastern Province. The labour folce participation ratefor the third quarter of 2003 excluding the Eastern province

was 49.4 per cent. The decline was seen in both female andmale labour force participation rates. However, the femaleparticipation rate declined from 32.0 per cent in the thirdquarter of 2002 to 30.8 per cent in the third quarter of 2003,compared to the male participation rate which fellcorrespondingly from 67.8 per cent to 67.1 per cent.7.4 Employment

In the QLFS, an employed person is defined as one whoworked for pay, profit or unpaid family gain for one hour ormore during the week preceding the survey. Employeestemporarily absent from work, due to illness, bad weather andlabour disputes are considered as employed. According to theQLFS, the percentage employed declined from 92.5 per cent atend2002 to 90,8 per cent in the first quarter 2003,reversing theincreasing trend seen since the second quarter 2002, beforeincreasing to 91.6 per cent by the third quarter 2003. Theincrease in the first quarter of 2003 compared to the fourthquarter 2002 was partly due to inclusion of the EasternProvince in the QLFS from the first quarrer of 2003. Thepercentage of employed for the first quarter 2003 excluding theEastern Province stood at9l.7 per cent.There were no major shifts among the five categories ofemployment status. The public sector employees' sharedeclined marginally, reflecting continued government policy tolimit new public sector employment only to essential staffingrequirements. The share of private sector employees alsodeclined from 45.7 per cent to 44.1 per cent. The share of theself-employed and unpaid family workers increased as did theshare of employers, albeit marginally.The shrinkage of public sector employment was evidentfrom the results of the centralBank's ApsES. According to thesurvey estimates, the number of employees in government

institutions, which cover central government, provincial

1,043,208 in 2003. The APSES covered around 6l per cent of

the total number of government and semi-governmentinstitutions and the percentage share of employment coverage

to the total estimated public sector employment in 2003 was 93

per cent.The decrease in the number of employees in the semi-

govemment sector by around 5 per cent was mainly a reflectionof fiscal consolidation efforts and public enterprise retorms.

This further confirms the commitment of the government tolimit recruitments to the public sector. The continuation of vRSwas the main reason for the reduction of emproyees in the semi-government sector. The successful implementation of vRSprogrammes in semi-government institutions, such as SriLanka Ports Authority, ceylon petroleum corporation and sriLanka Telecom Ltd., reduced their employment by 4,4g1,1,587 and, 1,124, respectively, in 2003. The percentage share

of employment reduction through vRS out of the estimatedtotal reduction in the semi-government sector was 52 per cent.The performance of most of these institutions during 2003 interms of expansion of activity and contribution to economicgrowth (see Chapter 2), indicates that there had been anincrease in efficiency and productivity following the VRS.In addition, the strict control on recruitment and non_extension of services after 55-57 years reduced the number ofemployees in government institutions such as the Departmentof Railways and semi govemment institutions such as people'sBank. A further reduction of employees was seen in the SriLanka state Plantation corporation due to the privatisation ofthree estates owned by the government.The employment shares in the Agriculture, forestry andfishing; Construction and Transport, storage andcommunication sectors rose from the third quarter 2002 to thethird quarter 2003. Employment in the Agriculture, forestry andfishing sector increased by 318,556 during rhis period. Thesuccessful Yala season in 2003 for paddy where productiongrew by 7,9 pr cent and area under cultivation by I I per centcompared to 2002, was a major reason for this increase.Further, the inclusion of the Eastern province in the eLFS alsocontributed, as the Agriculture sector is a major employmentgenerating sector in the Eastern province. Employmentincreased by around 130,000 in the Construction sector, whichgrew by 5.5 per cent in 2003. The peaceful conditions thatprevailed due to the continuation of the ceasefire in 2003 redto an increase in construction activities, including in the North

Introduction

People who seek jobs require perfect information about thequalifications, skills and experience demanded by

employers and of the job description and the remuneration

that they will get. Similarly, employers wish to know whereto find the perfect match of qualifications, skills and

experience to fill in their vacancies. In practice, a perfect

labour market information situation is a near impossibility.In the Sri Lanka labour market, the mismatch between

labour demand and supply due to supply constraints such as

the lack of required educational qualifications and skills

among job seekers and reluctance to accept specific job

opportunities due to cultural restrictions, as well as the lackof information available to both job seekers and potential

employees, is significant.

Box 13

own business. The job seekers and the self-employed can

register themselves in the JobsNet on-line through the web

page of the JobsNet or by visiting a service centre; Potential

employers can advertise vacancies by requesting such

vacancies with JobsNet in the same manner. The registeredjob seekers are matched with local and foreign vacancies

available in the JobsNet database. Once a match is made.they are referred to the relevant employer. Setting up

linkages with skills and prot'essional training and retraining

organisations and job counselling are important functionsof the JobsNet. If a registered job seeker fails to make a

match after over 3 months, the application willbe rei'iewed

and, if necessary, directed to career counselling and, in time

to come, will be referred to suitable training programmes.In addition, applicants who opt fol self-employmenf are

directed to suitable training programmes.

Progress Made

The Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation(NORAD) made a grant of Rs. 40 million for initial planningof the JobsNet project towards achieving its first year

tar-uets. The JobsNet opened the first service centre in

January 2003 at Agalawatte and a str-ing of l6 more centres

fbllowed between mid-Malch and May 2003.,The service

centres in various parts of the country are linked to the He adOffice in Colombo through a network operating on a

sophisticated info-communication system. As seen fl'omTable l, the JobsNet has moved forward rapidly since

commencement.

Since the JobsNet had information regarding thetraining needs required to enhance the registered job

seekers' employability, setting up linkages with skillstraining and retraining organisations was carried out

To address these issues, the concept of JobsNet was

incorporated as Initiative 7: National Employment Sourcing

and Delivery System in the Draft National EmploymentPolicy-2002 (DNEP) prepared by the Ministry ofEmployment and Labour (MEL). The DNEP strongly

recommended that JobsNet should be independent, impartialand free from all politics, allowing the practice of

meritocracy with transparency to be its guiding principles.

The JobsNet project was initiated as a public-private sectorpartnership. The MEL joined hands with the CeylonChamber of Commerce (CCC) representing the private

sector, and CCC was entrusted with the management of

JobsNet.

JobsNet is an on-line and service centre based

employment delivery network providing a user-friendlyinterface between job seekers and po[ential employers.

and the East, and also in road development. Employment in the

Transport, storage and communication sub sector in Services

also increased significantly, commensurate with the high

growth seen in that sector.

7.5 Unemployment

With the inclusion of the Eastern Province in the QLFS from

2003, the unemployment rate rose to9-2 per cent in the first

quartqr of 2003 from 7.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2002.

However, following this break in the series, the unemployment

rate settl€d gradually during the year, due to employment

opportunities generated as a result of new economic activities

with the continued recovery in the economy since 2002. This

was evident from the decline in the unemployment rate from

9.1 per cent in the third quarter 2002to 8,4 per cent in the third

quarter of 2003, even inclusive of the Eastern Province'

According to the QLFS, the unemployment rate among

the educated youth declined, reversing the increasing trend of

the past few years. The unemployment rate of the 15-19 and 20-

29 yeu age groups declined from 35,0 and}}-4per cent to29.9

and 19.6 per cent, respectively, from the third quarter of 2002to the third quarter of 2003. Meanwhile, the decline in

unemployment among the higher educated was evident from

the relatively higher decline in the unemployment rate for the

GCE(O/L) and the GCE(A/L) and higher qualified categoriesfrom l3.l per cent and 17.3 per cent, respectively in the third

quafter of 2002,to ll.2 per cent and 15.2 per cent, respectively,

in the third quarter of 2003.The lack of the required educational qualifications and

skills among educated youth has been a key reason for youth

unemployment in Sri Lanka, In order to address this problem,

the Ministry of Policy Development and Implementation

(MPDI) initiated a Youth Corps programme in 2003 to provide

opportunities for youth in the age group of 18-28 years to

acquire employable skills with leadership qualities and self

confidence that would enable their active participation as

productive partners in the global market economy. The

objective of the Youth Corps programme, which is non-

military, is to develop youth, both male and female, through awell planned and integrated package of employment-oriented

training. The integrated package includes training in leadership,

English, computer and information technology, productivity

and career guidance, vocational training and entrepreneurship

development programme activities.

The entire programme willbe divided into 3 phases. Phase

one is expected to convert these youth from their isolated home

environments into a dedicated and disciplined force that learns

to work as a team. Phase one will provide l0 weeks of non-

residential training. The second phase will be for 25 weeks andwill provide computer and English training and involvement in

community development work. The third phase for 35 weekswill mainly focus on providing vocational training chosen by

the participants to equip them with employable skills to find

employment or to start their own enterprise. This phase would

be linked up with the Ministry of Tertiary Education and

Vocational Training, JobsNet, the Board of Investment and

foreign employment agencies to enhance the employability of

the participants. More importantly, the participants would be

introduced to the private sector during their basic training at

Phase one so that they are ready to link and interact with the

participants at each phase of the programme.Initially, the MPDI envisaged that once the Youth Corps

programme was established there would be 3,000 Youth Range

Leaders in 160 Youth Corps Centres across the country, with

each Centre providing training to 250 unemployed youth,

making the potential intake 40,000. With the available

infrastructure, the MPDI is expected to set up 58 Youth Corps

Centres and recruit 14,500 Youth Corps Rangers before end

2004. The programme trained 831 youth as Youth Range

Leaders from May 2003, before placing them in 19 Youth

Corps Centres, covering 11 districts, excluding those in the

North and East. These Youth Corps training centres, which

commenced operations in November 2003, have initially

recruited 2,913 youth as Youth Rangers. The 831 trained Youth

Rangers Leaders also follow the training programme along

with the Youth Rangers.

7.6 Foreign Employment

According to the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment(SLBFE), the registered number of departures for foreignemployment increasedby 2.3 per cent in 2003 over 2002compared to a corresponding increase of 10.7 in 2002. Theregistered number of departures during 2003 stood at20g,43gcompared to203,773 in2002 and fell below the annuar forecasrof 210,000 for 2003.The deceleration in the rate of increase in the registerednumber of departures for foreign employment was higheramong females. The female share was in a range of 65 to 6lper cent for the five years from 1998 to2002 and wheneverthere was a significant increase in foreign employment, it wasmainly among females. This share fell to below 65 per cent in2003. In particular, there was a decrease of around 7.500 in thehousemaids category in 2003 compared to2002, althoughthere were increases in all other categories, particularly inunskilled labour.As the competition from other countries has increased inthe housemaids category, the Sri Lankan authorities were ofthe view that those in this category should be given skillstraining to divert them to other categories of skill.Furthermore, the Ministry of Women's Affairs (MWA) hasencouraged females to take up self-employment in Sri Lankain an effort to reduce the socio-economic problems associatedwith the large numbers of migrant female workers leavingtheir families behind for employment in recent times. Inaddition to the social problems, some of them have faceddifficulties ranging from harassment to death. The MWAdesigned a programme in 2003 to train women inentrepreneurship skills and to plan self-employment projects

according to the resources available and the market demandexisting in their areas with the support of the Industrial

Development Board (IDB), As an initial step, the MWA has

commenced a countrywide awareness programme for womenwho seek foreign employment for the first time and formigrant women workers who had gone abroad on a few

occasions.In order to minimise the problems faced by migrant

workers, the SLBFE signed an agreement on migrant worker

safety and welfare with Malaysia. A US dollars 5,000

insurance policy per worker and a day off per week as aworker right were two main clauses included in the

agreement. In addition, each recruiting agency of the labour

demanding country was expected to deposit US dollar 50,000with the representative office of the Ministry of Labour in Sri

Lanka situated in that particular country to ensure the safetyof and regular payments to migrant workers by their

employers. With regard to the welfare of the families ofmigrant workers, the SLBFE continued to support them

through scholarships and the distribution of school materialsfor children of migrant workers. The number of scholarships

awarded increased from 1,594 in2002 to 1,671 and school

materials were distributed among 8,846 students at a cost of

Rs. 9.3 million in 2003.Sri Lanka has been earning more foreign exchange from

foreign employment than from all major agricultural crops since

2001. In 2003, net foreign private transfers, which are mainly

worker remittances from the Middle East, accounted for 30 per

cent of national savings of the country,
