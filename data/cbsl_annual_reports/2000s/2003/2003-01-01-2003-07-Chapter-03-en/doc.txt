3.1- Overall Trends

Though Sri Lanka has been engaged in agriculture for

centuries its agriculture sector is still heavily concentrated on

a few major crops: paddy, tea, rubber, coconut and a f'ew other

field crops. This concentration, while narr-owing prospects for

enhancing the incomes of people, has entailed the risk of

depending on a single crop's performance tor their livelihood.

The short-run performance of the sector depends pLimarily onweather conditions, security situation and international

commodity prices. In the long run, the growth of the sectol is

determined primarily by research and development efforts,

extension services, infrastructure facilities, domestic tladepolicy, government intervention and international tradepolicies on agriculture.

on tea have reduced the country's ability to reap the full

potential from commercial agricultural crops.Agriculture, livestock and fisheries sector recorded anoverall growth in volume terms of 1,5 per cent in 2003.

Favourable weather supported the recovery in paddy and

coconut sectors, but tea production, mostly in low grown areas

was affected by floods in May. Paddy and other field crops

benefitted from the favourable security situation in the aff'ected

areas of the North and the East after the peace process was

initiated in early 2002.

Paddy, rubber, coconut and a majority of other field crops

performed better and contributed to the overall growth of the

agriculture sector in 2003. Paddy output reached an all time

high level by surpassing the previous peak output of 2,860

thousand metric tons in 2000 by 7 per cent.The extents sown and harvested during both Maha and

Yala seasons expanded, benefiting from better monsoons and

improved security situation in the North and the East. Otherfield crops too performed better in 2003, but potatoes and big

onions failed to do likewise,Meanwhile, the tree crop sector recorded mixed resultsduring 2003. Coconut production increased by 7 per cent,recovering from the lowest production in 2002 that was

experienced in a decade. Rubber production, respondingpositively to attractive prices, increased by 2 per cent.

However, tea production, which had recorded, the highest ever

output in2002, suffered a setback in 2003' The Iraq war that

temporarily disrupted the tea matket, the mid year floods and

the earth slips that adversely affected the low country teaproducing areas were the main reasons for this setback.Meanwhile, sugar production, recovering from three

consecutive years of declining output, increased by 45 per cent

in 2003, a direct result of positive incentives that emanated

from the privatisation of the majority shareholding of both

Pelwatte and Sevenagala.

3.2 Agricultural Policy and InstitutionalSupport

The policy on agriculture in any economy should aim at

developing a viable and sustainable agricultural sector capable

of competing successfully with competitor countries, while

sustaining the farmers engaged in agriculture. A necessary

requirement to attain this goal is the flexibility and adoptabilityof the sector to absorb new technology and raise productivity

so that its average costs remain competitively low. Such

During the last decade, yields of major agriculture cropsincreased, particularly due to increasing private sectorparticipation, but they ate still below the potential yields.

Liberalisation and deregulation of seed, planting material, and

land acquisition to some extent, together with privatisation of

state farms have paved the way for a greater involvement of the

private corporate sector in agriculture production' Meanwhile'

growing fiscal constraints and competing needs indicated the

unsustainability of continuation of untargetted agriculture

subsidies. Infrastructure bottlenecks continued to hamper the

proper distnbution of agricultural produce, thereby, reducing

margins available to farmers. Ad hoc trade policies created

uncertainty, discouraging long-term private investment in

agriculture. Trade protection in some of Sri Lanka's h'ading

partner countries, particularly import restrictions and high tariff

Estimation of a Production Index forSector inIntroduction

Agriculture contains several heterclgeneous sub sectors.Consequently; assessing overall performance in the sectoris difficult. One way to overcome this difficulty is tocompute a production index, by giving appropriate weighrto clch heterogeneous sub sector.Production indices are computed for diffcrentpurposes. Hence, the indices conrpiled by diff'erent trgenciesmay diffel from one another because of differences incoverage, weights, and the choice of base yerr.. Folexample, the Food and Agricultur'e Organisation (FAO)computes indices of aglicultural production in cliffer-cntcountries, which show the relative level of the aggLegatevolume of agricultural producrion for .o.nl..l incomparison with the base period 1989-91, 'Ihe maincategories of the FAO production index include cereal,crops, lbod, livcstock and non-food irems excluding fbddercrops. Production quantitJe s in the FAO indices arecomputed after deducting quantities used as seed and f'ced.Thcrefole the index represents disposable pr.oduction forany use, excluding seed and fecd, The Dcp:irtment ofCensus and Statistics of Sli I anka computes a volume .inclexof agr:iculture and livestock production, annually. Theycompute separate indices fbr tea, rubber, coconut, paddy,highland crops, livestock, minor export crops and an overallindex. However, this index is computed with a lag o1'abourtwo years. Hence, a need has arisen to clevelop an up to datcindex covering all major sub sectors in agriculture toevaluate the performance of the agriculture sector-. ThcCentrirl Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) undeltook this task tofacilitate analysis lequired for monetary poiicy purposes.

Coverage of Indices

The Agriculture Ptoduction Index developed by the CBSLcovers three sub-sectors, viz: AgricuJture, Livestock andFisheries. Each sub-sector is divided into several sub-categories, The agriculture sector covers plantation ct.ops,paddy, which is the predominant, crop in domesticagriculture, other crops categories such as othei field cr.ops,vegetables, fruits, export suga'cane andtclbacco, The livestock s milk and eggprcduction.

Method of Calculation

Average values for the period 1997-2000 were used as basevalues for the annual index. The average of four years wastaken to eliminate seasonal production patterns andvariations due to changes in the weather patterns. Basevalues for the half- year and quarterly indices werecomputed by dividing annual values and volumes into twoequal parts and fburequal parts, respectively.The volume index rvas calculated as a Laspeyresquantity index' . The volume index is calculated usingcommodities in the primary filrm before any value addition.Wherever data were available in a processed form they,were converted to primary products using relevantconversion factors (e-{. green leaf for tea, dry rubber contentfor rubber', fresh nut for coconut etc.)

The value index was computed as a simple index of theratio of values benveen the current oeriod and the baseperiod2 .

The price index is computed as the ratio between thevnlue index and the volume index. thus becoming thePaasche indexr,

Paddy, tea and coconuf to-{ethet'contribute to more than 50

per cent of the agriculture production as shorvn in Chart l.

The overall index shows an increasing trend and

reported the highest value in 2000 mainly due to higher

production of paddy, tea and coconut, despite a temporaly

setback in 2001 due to clrou-eht, ln 2002, the sector

recovered with the improved paddy harvest and a record tea

crop. In 2003, the overall agricultural production index

increased fulther as shown in Chart 2, due to a substantial

increase in the paddy harvest. The volume index of the otheragriculture sector hits showtr a decline in recent years

agricultural policies normally span a wide spectrum of areassuch as agricultural research, new technology and its costlesstransfer, diversification of crops, liberalisation, deregulationand provision of incentives through privatisation, pricestabilisation, input management, subsidies and extensionservices and environmental protection for sustainabledevelopment. All these policies should establish the necessaryincentive structure so that the sector could move forwardwithout continuous external support. The country's agriculturalpolicy was spelled out in two statements made by the Ministryof Agriculture and Livestock (MAL), and the Council forAgriculture Research and Policy (CARP). The policy thrustwas focussed on uplifting the agricultural sector whosecontribution to the national economy and return to investmenthave been well below the potential.The National Policy on Agriculture and Livestock(NPAL) drafted by MAL for the period from 2003 ro 2010emphasises the need for mobilising both state sector andprivate sector involvement and developing human resourcesto transform the domestic agriculture and livestock industryinto a sustainable and strong economic force. As expansion ofIand area is limited, intensifying production technologyassumes greater priority. This is complemented by theNational Agriculture Research Policy formulated by CARp,which emphasises the need for demand driven research andthe development of technology in areas such as plantbreeding, crop improvement, hybrid seed development,integrated pest management, bio-pesticides and bio-fertiliserdevelopment, irrigation water management, soil fertilitymanagement, fiuit and floriculture development, and postharvest processing. The policy also attempts at streamliningextension services and improving the process of disseminationof infbrmation and technology.Other key reform areas identified in the NPAL are marketreforms, enhancing the lole of private entrepreneurship inagriculture, closer integration with the food processingindustry, and conservation and sustainable use of resources.In 2003, government efforts were focussed onproductivity improvement and crop diversification, developingmarketing infrastructure, increasing pr.ivate sectorparticipation, input management and agriculture pricestabilisation.With the intention of improving productivity and cropdiversification, CARP awarded in 2003 Rs.l 18 million for 83research projects conducted by different research institutions,universities and the private sector in areas of plant breeding,plant pathology, food technology, soil and fertiliserimprovement, agronomy, horticulture, and plant protection.To improve marketing infrastructure, two dedicatedeconomic centres were developed at Meegoda and Embilipitiyain 2003. Those centres provided a convenient trading floor forfarmers to sell their products to the retail and wholesale dealersdirectly, thereby realising a better price for their produce. TheCentral Bank of Sri Lanka continued its efforts to popularise

the Forward Sales Contract Scheme. An added feature of thescheme was its facilitation to obtain credit by both the producerand the buyer through participating banks.The Seed Act was passed in the Parliament in 2003 whichwill protect farmers' right to obtain good quality seeds andplanting material, while improving the standards of the seed

and planting material production industry.The Sri Lanka Tea Board granted an interest subsidy of 50per cent on working capital loans for private tea factory ownersto overcome the financial difficulties faced by them due to thedrop in prices at the time of the war in Iraq. SLTB alsoallocated Rs. l0 million to be paid among the tactory ownersfor repairing damaged machinery and equipment from thefloods. The government paid Rs. 45.7 million as compensationto tea factory owners in the districts of Galle, Matara andRatnapura for the losses incurred in green leaf and stocks ofmade tea due to the floods in May 2003.

The fertiliser subsidy scheme continued to operate in 2003where a fixed sum of Rs 6,000 per metric ton was given forUrea, inespective of the international pnce. As expected, thenew scheme encouraged imports when international priceswere low.The government made specific attempts to enhance theprivate sector participation in agriculture development. Anumbrella body for the tea industry, Tea Association of SriLanka, was formed as a f'ederation of six key stakeholdets inthe industry. The stakeholders are the Planters' Association ofCeylon, the Colombo Te a Traders Association, the TeaExporters' Association, Sri Lanka Federation of Tea SmallHoldings Development Societies, Private Tea Factory OwnersAssociation and the Colombo Brokers' Association. TheAssociation willbe initially funded by the Asian DevelopmentBank under the Plantation Development Project. TheParliament passed a bill to increase the number of members ofthe Rubber Research Board up to eleven to accommodategreater private sector participation. Of those eleven members.seven will be appointed from the private sector representingvarious sectors in the rubber industry.In 2003, ten managing agents with controlling interests inl3 regional plantation companies agreed to reduce themanagement f'ees from 50 per cent to 10 - 20 per cent. Thelower f'ee structure follows a fbrmula based on the percentageof profit befole the payment of interest, corporate tax,depleciation and amortisation and covers a period of five yearsbeginning from 2004. The fee will be gradually reduced to alow level of l0 per cent by 2008, the final year of thisagreement. Companies subscribing to the new structure willbeeligible for credit under the ADB funded US dollar 135 millionloan scheme provided at a concessionary interest rate.The Cabinet of Ministers approved the restructuring ofnine loss making NationalLivestock Development Board farmsin 2003 by way of privatisation or appointing managing agents.The earmarked farms are Ridigama farm, Kandakaduwa farm(North Central), Kandakaduwa farm (Southern), Haragama

On the tariff front, the specific duty on rice was raisedfrom Rs.5 per kg to Rs.7 per kg on 5 March 2003 and then

increased to Rs. 9 per kg on 2l August, 2003. With effect from4 September 2003, the specific duty of Rs,6 per kg on big

onions and Rs,3.50 per kg on sugar were raised to Rs.8 per kg

and Rs.3.75 per kg, respectively.Agriculture sector is facing new issues and challenges

arising from gladual liberalisation, openness and globalisation.

Policy inconsistency and the lack of a well specified time frame

for liberalisation hinders investment in the sector. The shortageof agricultulal laboul will continue to be a selious problem.

Land ti'agmentation will worsen this problem, as it does not

permit labour substitution through mechanisation. It would beincreasingly difficult to oppose any forces of creative

destruction arising from evolving international and domestic

developments until Sri Lanka's agriculture falls on to a self-

sustainable path. However, there is a need to continue to

prepare a conducive macroeconomic environment, while

promoting research and development to uplift the sector trom

its current plight.

3.3 Export Crops

Tea

Tea production in 2003 declined by 2 per cent from the peak

output of 310 million kg. in 2002to 303 million k-e. Floods and

earth slips aft-ected low elevation tea production, while the dry

spell that prevailed in December 2003 affected the productionin all three elevations, High grown tea ploduction reported a

decline of 6 per cent to 82 million kg, while medium grown fea

output also declined marginally. The low grown teas, which

accounted for over 55 per cent of the total output, declined byI per cent to I68 million kg. The production of cut, tear andcurl (CTC) teas at. Ll .6 million kg declined by I per cent

compared to 2002.In 2003 tea impolts for blending and re-

exports increased from 2.5 million kg to 4.5 million kg.

As in the previous year, the smallholder sector continued

to play a dominant role in the tea industry contributing 62 per

cent of the national output in 2003. About 82 per cent of the

smallholders are concentrated in low grown areas, The average

yield in smallholder sector declined by I per cent to 2,267 kgper ha in 2003 due to the adverse effect of floods. The

estimated average yield in the estate sector in 2003 was 1,399kg pel ha, while the estimated national average yield was

1,834 kg per ha in 2003' .During the year, the cost of production of tea increased by

9.3 per cent to Rs 135.58 per kg due to increases in prices of

inputs such as fertiliser, agrochemicals, fuel and electricity.

Wage increases implemented in July 2002, also contributed to

the increase in cost of production.

Average yield of the estate sector is based on the bearing extentsprovided by the Plantation companies, while the smallholder yields areprovided by TSHDA.

Commensurate with the drop in production, the quantity

of tea traded at the Colombo Auctions also declined by 2 per

plantation companies faced financial difficulties, Ieadrng tocultail capital investment development and replanting on theestates. The delays in the availability of funds under the AsianDevelopment Bank's Plantation Development pLoject (pDp)for financing, hinde'ed the development of some tea estatesunder plantation companies.Tea expor-ts fi'om Sri Lanka, increased by 2 per cent to 29gmillion kg during 2003 incomparison to the previous year, dueto the running down of the carryover stocks from 2002. Thetotal expolt earnings from tea in rupee terms stood at Rs. 66billion (US dollars 683 million), indicaring an increase of 4.5per cent, compared to the previous year. The share of bulk teaexports declined from 64 per cent to 59 per cent due to aninctease in value added teas such as tea packets, tea bags andinstant tea. This resulted in an improvement of average expoltprice for tea in 2003.With a view to encouragin_e the development of the'Ready to Drink' (RTD) tea, the Sri Lanka Tea Board hasinitiated a financial assistance scheme by way of an inter-estsubsidy. Under this scheme, 50 per cent of the interest cost onloans obtained from banks or approved lending institutionsfor the procurement of necessary machinery to manufactureRTD teas is subsidised by the Sri Lanka Tea Board up to aperiod of five years. The maximum amount of the loan isRs. 20 million per project.The Tea Small Holdings Development Authoriry(TSHDA) continued to suppofr the rea smallholders byproviding necessary advisory and extension services andimplementing tea planting subsidy schemes together rvithspecial incentive scheme for replanting. The total subsidydisbursed to small holders tbr replanting, new planting andinfilling of tea amounted to Rs 157 million in 2003. Furrher, rheTHSDA continued the fertiliser distribution scheme under thecledit facilities for the benefit of smallholders.

Rubber

For the second consecutive year, rubber production increasedthough marginally (1.6 percent) to 92 million kg in 2003.Attractive prices during the year encouraged growers toincrease tapping intensity to raise rubber production. However.,output increases fell fi'om the potential due to a greater numberof rainy days during 2003.There was a shift from crepe rubber to the manufacture ofsheet rubber in response to higher profit margins in producingsheet rubber. Consequently, sheet lubber output increased byL7 per cent and accounted for 54 per cent of the total outputcompared to 47 per cent reportedin2002. Crepe lubber outputdeclined by 14 per cent and accounted fbr 24 per cent of totaloutput compal'ed to 29 per cent in 2002.The upward trend in Colombo Auction prices, whichcommenced in April 2002, continued during 2003. TheColombo Auction price of all grades of rubber increased to thehighest lupee prices ever on record. The avera_{e auction pr.icesof all grades of RSS at the Colombo Auction increased by about50 per cent in rupee terms. The annual average prices of latexcrepe rose around 60 per cent.

The national average yield of rubbel increased by 26 percent to 9ll kg per hectare. However, this yield is still wellbelow the potential yield of 1,500 - 2,000 kg per ha estimatedby the Rubbel Research Institute and the yield levels are wellbelow those in major competing countries like Thailand (1,531kg/ha) and Malaysia (1,047 kg/ha). The low yield levels aremainly attributed to non application of recommended levels oft'ertrliser', poor usage of rain guards, poor usage of high yieldingclones, non adherence to systematic infilling practices, andscarcity of competent and skilled tappers, Most of the practicesmentioned above are directly related to the productivity andincome in the sector. Scarcity of tappels is posing a seriousproblem to the industry. Owing to the relatively lower wages

Part IChapter 3 - AGRICULTURE, FISHING AND FORESTRY

and the low dignity attached to the occupation, members of the

younger generation are reluctant to be employed as tappers

even though tapping is a skilled job.

New planting of rubber recorded more than a thlee-fold

increase (by 219 per cent) to 450 hectares during 2003'Prevailing high prices encoulaged new planting butdiscouraged the uprooting of mature trees' As a result

replanting declined by 20 per cent to 564 hectare during the

year. In 2003,Rubber Development Department disbursed Rs.

62 million and Rs. 28 million for replanting and new planting,

respectively. Since the replanting subsidy covets only a smallportion of the cost of replanting, the Ministry of Plantation

Industties is planning to increase the subsidy'The domestic consumption of rubber in the industrial

sector increased by 4.4 percent to 57 million kg and accounted

for 62 per cent of national rubber output in 2003. The amountof rubber imported to the country in 2003 increased by 85

percent to 9 million kg. The quantity of rubber exported as

intermediate product declined by 4 per cent to 35 million kg

due to high domestic demand.

Coconut

Coconut output in 2003 grew by 7 pel cent reaching2,562

million nuts. Implovement was seen mostly in the second half

due to the lagged effect of the favourable weather that

prevailed in 2002. Furthermore, the application of fertiliser

was encoul.aged due to attractive coconut plices that prevailed

in 2002.The nut equivalent of the desiccated coconut production

increased by 50 per cent to 369 million nuts reflecting the

benefit of increased ct'op. However, the nut equivalent of

coconut oil production declined by 58 per cent to I l0 millionnuts, the lowest level recolded in the last ten yeals' Oil

production declined, as millers could not compete with

imported edible oil afteL the removal of the sulcharge in

September'2002. Exports of other kernel products increased

significantly during the year. Copra exports increased by 44 per

cent, while the export of fresh nuts too rose by 42 per cent

during the year. Nut equivalent of coconut cream, milk andmilk powder production almost doubled to (93 per cent

increase) 63 million nuts.

Other Export Crops

The other export cl'ops sectol', which consists of spices and

other agricultural commodities such as unmanufactured

tobacco, arecanut, cashew kemels, essential oils, foliage plants

and cut-flowers, reported a mixed performance in 2003.

Earnings trom this sector, as a whole declined (in rupee terms)

by 14 per cent to over Rs.14.5 billion due to low export prices

received for many commodities as well as a decline in export

volumes of major commodities such as cloves, unmanufactured

tobacco, pepper, arecanuts, cocoa beans and cashew kernels.

However, as in the previous year earnings from this sectorexceeded the total export earnings fl.om rubber and coconut.

Cinnamon is the most important crop in this sector. Theextent under cinnamon cultivation is estimated atapproximately 25j00 hectares. Sri Lanka is the wor-ld's la-gestproducer and exporter of cinnamon accounting fbr nearly twothirds of the global output. According to estimates of theDepartment of Export Agriculture (DEA), cinnamonproduction during 2003 increased by 8 per cent, but both,farmgate prices and export prices declined marginallycompared with the previous year.. Export earnings fromcinnamon in primaty fbrm amounted to Rs 4.3 billion, whileeamings from cinnamon bark oil and leaf oil exports amountedto Rs 224 million. Thele has been a steady increase in ear.ningsfrom cinnamon exports in the recent years and it has becomethe third largest export agricultural crop, next to tea andcoconut since 1998, There is a considerable potential for SriLanka to increase value added exports from cinnamon insteadof exporting it as a primary product,According to provisional estimates, there was no chan,uein output of pepper compaled to the pr.evious year. However,the export volume declined by 2 per cent to 1,140 metric tons.Export price too was lower than the previous year, whichreduced the export earning from Rs 1.5 billion to Rs L2 billion.Clove production declined by about 42 per cent to 2,360metric tons in 2003. The drop in output is artributed to theinclement weather that prevailed in May in some parts ofRatnapura, Kalutara, Matara and Galle districts. The drop inproduction coupled with low export prices resulted in asignificant decline in the export earnings from cloves. Exportsof cloves declined by 38 per cent to 2.5 million kg, and theexport earnings dropped to Rs.575 million in 2003 from Rs 2.7billion in2002.

Cashew kernelproduction increased by 29 per cent during2003. Extents under cashew increased steadily duLing recentyears as a result of the assistance provided by the Sr-i LankaCashew Corporation (SLCC) for cultivation, marketing andprocessing. Hence, as at 2003, the extent under cashew r-eached35,646ha. The organic cashew cultivation scheme initiated bythe SLCC continued in 2003. In order.to supply supelior plants

to farmers at the regional level a seed garden was establishedat Wilachchiya in Anuradhapura district in 2003 in addition toEluwankulama seed garden. With the collaborative plantingprogrammes, extension services, research and marketingprogrammes, it is expected that cashew industry will developfurther in the future.The foliage and cut flower sector made a significantcontribution to the export earnings during the year. Exportearnings from foliage plants, rooted cuttings and cut flowersrose by 17 per cent to Rs. 925 million during 2003. This secrorexpanded its activities with the assistance provided by theDepartment of Agriculture (DOA) and the Export DevelopmentBoard (EDB). DOA continued to assist the floriculture sectorby providing technical assistance, conducting trainingprogrammes, and issuing plant varieties though the NationalBotanical Gardens. EDB too assisted to develop the floriculturesector especially by providing advisory services to exportersand potential exporters by facilitating participation ininternational tlade fairs.The DEA continued to play a major role for thedevelopment of the export agriculture sector by implementingsubsidy schemes and providing necessary inputs, technicalinformation and extension services in cultivating andprocessing spices. However, the subsidies disbursed under theExpolt Agriculture Assistance Scheme declined further to Rs22.6 mlllion during 2003 due to lack of funds. As in 2002, morethan 50 per cent of the subsidy payment was for pepper. TheADB funded Second Perennial Crop Development Project(SPCDP) continued to operate its fifih year in 2003 to assistfluit crops, spices and horticulture sector by providing creditfacilities through eight participatory banks. SPCDP alsocontinued to assist DOA and DEA in the production of seeds

and planting material and in supply of farm advisory, marketingand technical services through its projects.

cent. Output in both seasons reached record high levels.

Favourable climate as well as the cessation of hostilities in the

Northern and the Eastern provinces contributed to the overall

improvement. Extents sown and harvested during both seasons

improved significantly. Output in the Maha Season surpassed

the previous best Maha output in 2000 by 6'4 per cent' Output

in Yala increased by 4.9 per cent over the previous best output

reported in 1999. However, for the second consecutive year the

annual average yield dropped as marginal lands came undercultivation as adequate rainfall prevailed during the two

cultivation seasons. The annual average yield declined by 3 per

cent to 3.8 metric tons per hectare. Even though the annual

average yield ofpaddy declined for the second consecutive year

afterreaching apeak in 2001, the paddy yield in Sri Lanka is

much higher than in many other countries in the region (see

Box 7), though it is still below the potential yield.

Increasing costs of cultivation and the small scale of

production resulted in very low average net income per paddy

farmer in Sri Lanka. The cultivation unit has declined steadily

because of fragmentation of holdings, which denies benefits of

economies of scale and raises the cost of production. Prices of

inputs such as fertiliser, agro chemicals, seed paddy, machinely

and labour have been growing steadily. Labour constitutes the

largest share accounting for over 50 per cent of the total cost

of ploduction. Furthermore there is a scarcity of labour during

the peak planting and harvesting periods. Fertiliser accounts for

about 12-15 per cent of the total cost of production.Paddy output during the 200212003 Maha season

increased by 7 per cent, despite a 5 per cent drop in yield, with

increased extents harvested. Of the 27 agLicultural districts, inl5 distLicts in the dry and intermediate zones production

increased, All the distncts in the Northern province reported

increased production and accounted for 7 pel cent of the total

Maha output. As in the previous year, the five major paddy

producing districts of Ampara, Kurunegala, Anuradhapura,

Polonnaruwa and Mahaweli "H" area together accounted for

more than half the Maha output (52 per cent.).

Output during the Yala season increased by 8 per cent,

despite the yield dropped marginally. The extents harvested

duling the Yala increased by approximately 9 per cent over the

previous Yala Season. Output in the Anuradhapura district

increased by 72 per cent, while notable other increases were

reported from Mahaweli "H" area (38 per cent), Hambantota

(34 per cent) and Trincomalee (24per cent). Three major paddy

producing distncts of Ampara, Polonnaruwa and Kurunegala

accounted for almost half of the Yala output (49 per cent). For

the tenth consecutive year, Ampara reported the highest output

and accounted fol almost one fifth of the total Yala production

(19 per cent).

The farmgate price of paddy dropped especially during the

harvesting periods. Any information on exaggerated output

than actual production leads to adverse expectations on prices'

Therefore, when disseminating future paddy production

projections the impact on farmgate prices should be taken into

account. To support farmgate price the govemment increased

the specific duty on imported rice tiom Rs'5 to Rs.7 per kg with

eftect from 5 March 2003. Subsequently, with a significant

Yala output this was increased further to Rs. 9 per kg with

etfect from 19 August 2003. After adjusting tor seed paddy

requirements and post harvest losses, the paddy production

during the year accounted for 98 per cent of the domestic

requirement. The balance requirement was imported and the

quantity imported during the year amounted to 35 thousand

metric ton compared with 95 thousand metric ton in 2002.Two new varieties of high yielding paddy, bred at

Bombuwela and Ambalanthota, were released during the year

by the Department of Agriculture, which could help to increase

vield in the future.

Other Field Crops

In 2003, the other field crops which include grain legumes,cereal crops, tuber crops and others perfbrmed better than theprevrous year except potato and big onion. Soya bean outputincreased for the second consecutive year and reported a morethan two fbld increase due to an increase in the extent cultivated

as well as an improvement in the yield. Other grain legumeswhich reported improved outputs were cowpea (39 per cent),black gLam (17 per cent) and green gram (10 per cent). Almostthe entire improvement in the output of cowpea and green gram

was due to an expansion in the extent under cultivation. Blackgram output increased due to increases in both extent and theyield levels.

Output of chillies during 2003 remained at the same levelas in 2002. However, chillie production declined steadilyduring the last decade and the present output is about one thirdof the output in the early 1990s. This is mainly due to theinability of domestic producels to compete with importedchillies, The cost of production of chillies has increased withescalating prices of inputs and stagnated yields. To protect tlredomestic chillie farmers a specific duty of Rs.30 per kg wasimposed in March 2002. This specific duty was maintained atthe same level throughout 2003.Output of potato which increased steadily since 1998reported a l9 per cent drop due to a reduction in the extentcultivated as well as a drop in the average yield. The heavyprotection given to potato farming resulting in higherprofitability has encouraged farmers to resort to repeated

cultivation of potato in the same fields without adhering to therecommended practices of crop lotation. Continuouscultivation leads to the build up of soil borne pathogens, whichis very detrimental to potato yields.

Red onion production reported an increase of I per cent,while big onion production declined by 2 per cent.Reflecting the impact of domestic output decline, potatoand chillies imports increased by 7 per cent l0 per cent,respectively.

Fruits and Vegetables

Overall vegetable production increased by 2 per cent to

552,000 metric tons in 2003. Both low country vegetables andup country vegetables reported production incteases. The

extent cultivated under vegetables increased by about 3 per centduring the year. This was the combined effect of a 6 per cent

increase of the extent under 2002103 Maha season and about 2percent drop in the extent cultivated during 2003Yala season.

However, in spite of an increase in the output of vegetables theprices reported an increase during tire year. A major portion of

the production is consumed locally arid exports are less than Iper cent of the domestic production.

There was an increase in overall fruit production in 2003.

The production of banana, mango and papaw increased, whilepineapple production declined compared to the previous year.However, prices increased due to high demand particularlyfrom the recovering tourist sector. During 2003, Sri Lanka

imported more than 52,600 metric tons of fresh and dned fruits,

valued at Rs.l.8 billion. Of the total volume of imports, apples

accounted for 43 per cent.DOA has released several new varieties of high yielding

fruits, vegetables, leafy vegetables, root crops, and condiments

during the year and canied out several training programmes on

protected agriculture and post harvest processing. The Instituteof Post Harvest Technology (IPHT) introduced plastic cratesfor transportation of fruits and vegetables from collectors in

Keppetipola, Mahaweli system G and H to wholesale market

in Colombo and the Dedicated Economic Centre in Dambulla,

under their 'Fresh Produce Chain' project to reduce post

harvest losses during transportation, which iue very high in Sri

Lanka. Under this project 5,836 crates have been purchased by

collectors and several such chains are now in operation. IPHT

is conducting research to further develop post harvest handling.It also canied out training programmes towards upgrading the

knowledge of producers, processors, traders and extension

officers in both public and private sectors in the area of post

harvest loss prevention and development of value added agro-

processing enterpri ses.During 2003, more than 9.4 million kg of vegetables and

7.7 million kg of fresh and dried fruits, valued at Rs 679 million

and Rs 605 million respectively were exported. In addition, the

processed fruit and vegetable exports amounted to7.6 million

kg, valued at Rs 801 million. Even though a large variety of

fruits are being exported only a few export oriented commercialcultivation is done except for pineapple. Cultivation in

controlled environment, using tissue culture plants would help

to increase the output as well as the quality of the output.

Sugar

After the privatisation programme, consisting of a sale of 90

per cent of the government's share in Sevanagala and 53 per

cent of the share at Pelwatte to the private sector in2002, sugar

production is showing positive results by way of increased

outputs at both the factories. Consequently, sugar production

in 2003 increased by 42 per cent to 54,365 metric tons

following the output declines over the previous three years. The

output at Pelwatte and Sevanagala which increased by 57 per

cent and l8 per cent, respectively, is attributed entirely to anincrease in the quantity of cane crushed since the sugar

recovery rates declined.The quantity of cane crushed at Pelwatte increased by 67per cent. Improvements in both own and private canecultivation contributed towards the overall performance' At

Sevanagala the cane crushed increased by 20 per cent.Domestic production caters to less than 15 per cent of the

national requirement.Although commercial sugar cultivation commenced

several decades ago, the industry is beset with several structural

problems. Low yields, poor recovery rates and constant labour

problems have adversely impacted the industry. Furthermore,the decline in the international price of sugar also hasnegatively impacted the local industry. Hence, sugarproduction per se will not be a profitable venture. Therefore,while producing sugar the industry should also invest in the

brewing of good quality alcohols and other spirits to make the

industry viable.

3.5 Fish and Livestock

Fish

Total fish production in 2003, declined by 5.4 per cent ro284,960 metric tons. Production in the marine sector, whichaccounts for 89 per cent (254,680 metric tons) of total fishproduction, dropped by 6,8 percent. In contrast, the inland andaquaculture fish production increased by 7 .6 percent to 30,280metric tons in 2003.The drop in the marine sector output is partly due to theimposition of new laws that prohibited the use of certain typesof fishing gear. However, the negative impact of this policy isa temporary phenomenon, as these laws will ensuresustainability in the long run by reducing over exploitation ofmarine resources. The loss of fishing days due to bad weatherexperienced in the Southern and the North Western coastalareas during the months of May and June 2003 also adverselyaffected the marine fish production. However, policies andregulations applicable in the fisheries sector have to bereformed to attract private investment including foreigninvestment in order to ensure the long-term growth in theindustry. Improvement in inland and aquaculture fishproduction is mainly due to the increase in stocking fingerlingsin the inland reservoirs.The total volume of fish and fishery product exports,increased by 13.3 per cent to 14,714 metric tons in 2003.

Crustacean exports increasedby 31 percentto6,T4l metric tonsaccounting fbr 45 percent of total fish exports. Earnings fromfish exports increased by 20 per cent to Rs 8,953 million.During the year, earnings from the export of ornamental fishamounted to Rs. 623 million, an increase of l8 per cent overthe previous year.An important development in the fisheries sector during2003 is the proposed fish-canning factory, which is a jointventure between Union Fish Product Ltd of the CeylonFishelies Corporation and the Inform Progress Bank of Russia.This would fulfill a long-felt need of the Sri Lankan fisheriesindustry. According to estimates, the factory will produce 21.5

tons of canned trsh per day targeting both the export market and

the localmarket, Further, the provision of modem vessels, coldstolage facilities, and extensive research in ocean resources tobetter use, are also essential to sat'eguard the country's fishingindustry from the threat posed by the legal as well as illegalforeign fishing vessels and to encourage deep sea fishing, thustaking fuil advantages of the ocean resources sunounding theisland.

Livestock

Dairy and poultly which are the two main sub sectors in thelivestock sector performed well during in 2003 compared with

the previous year. According to available estimates, cows milkploduction increased by 2 per cent to 156 million litres. Incontrast, buffalo milk production dropped marginally (by 0.4per cent) to 30 million litres, The producer price of milkremained unchanged at Rs.15 per litre during the year.However, the cost of production increased due to increases inanimal t'eed prices.

The current supply of milk is adequate to meet only aboutl5 per cent of the country's requirement. The balance isimported mostly in the form of powdered milk. During the year61,94I metric tons of milk and milk-based products wereimported incurring import bill of Rs.l1.5 billion.Poultry meat production increased by 3,6 in 2003, while

egg production declined marginally to 884,8 million eggs. High

cost of animal feed and limited intiastructure facilities such ascold rooms reduces profit margins of producers. Chickproduction increased by 5.3 per cent to 74 million chicks,The high cost of animal feed is one of the biggestdrawbacks to developing the livestock industry. Cost of animalfeed increased by over l0 per cent in 2003. At present, animalfeed milling is done by utilising expensive imported raw

materials. This can be minimised by encouraging the use oflocal raw material in the provender industry. Non-availabilityof good quality animals is another serious constraint for the

expansion of the dairy sector. One of the principal programmesfor improving dairy cattle is to upgtade the animal populationwith artificial insemination.

3.6 Inputs

Fertiliser

Duling 2003, total fertiliser sales declined by l0 per cent to

592,000 metric tons. Decline in fertiliser issued to the paddy

and tea sectors were the main reasons. The rise in fertiliserprices as a result of the revision of fertiliser subsidy scheme in

October 2002 with increased prices in the international market

had a negative impact on fertiliser use in 2003. Fertiliser sales

to the paddy sector declined by 18 per cent in 2003. The declinein the extent under paddy during 2003104 Maha season, due todrought resulted in a reduction in fertiliser usage for paddy.

Fertiliser issues to tea too declined by 7 per cent in 2003 as a

result of the low prices during the first half of the year at theColombo Auctions due to uncertainties caused by the war inIraq. However, fertiliser issues to rubber and coconut sectors

increased due to the attractive rubber and coconut prices that

prevailed during the year.The tertiliser subsidy scheme, which was revised inOctober 2002, continued in 2003, As at end 2003, the total

subsidy payments to urea amounted to Rs 2.5 billion. Under the

revised scheme a fixed sum of Rs 6,000 per metric ton is givenas a subsidy payment for urea imports, However, the

international price of urea increased by 30 per cent in 2003

compared to the previous year due to the high demand fl'ommajor grain producing countries as well as an increase in

petroleum prices. This led to an increase in the price of urea in

the domestic market.

Seed

The production of certitied seeds is handled by the private

sector. The DOA produces foundation seeds and registered

seeds of the recommended varieties of paddy and issues themto the registered seed growers and farmer organisations formultiplication of seeds. During 2003 DOA produced 166metric tons (8,000 bushels) of foundation seeds and 1,706metric tons (82,000 bushels) of registered seeds of 22recommended varieties of paddy and issued to the privatesector growers and farmer organisations. The quantity of

certified paddy seeds produced during the year increased by l4per cent to 14,581 metric tons (701,000 bushels). This wassufficient only to meet 16 per cent of the total national seed
