    "text": "agricultural policies normally span a wide spectrum of areassuch as agricultural research, new technology and its costlesstransfer, diversification of crops, liberalisation, deregulationand provision of incentives through privatisation, pricestabilisation, input management, subsidies and extensionservices and environmental protection for sustainabledevelopment. All these policies should establish the necessaryincentive structure so that the sector could move forwardwithout continuous external support. The country's agriculturalpolicy was spelled out in two statements made by the Ministryof Agriculture and Livestock (MAL), and the Council forAgriculture Research and Policy (CARP). The policy thrustwas focussed on uplifting the agricultural sector whosecontribution to the national economy and return to investmenthave been well below the potential.The National Policy on Agriculture and Livestock(NPAL) drafted by MAL for the period from 2003 ro 2010emphasises the need for mobilising both state sector andprivate sector involvement and developing human resourcesto transform the domestic agriculture and livestock industryinto a sustainable and strong economic force. As expansion ofIand area is limited, intensifying production technologyassumes greater priority. This is complemented by theNational Agriculture Research Policy formulated by CARp,which emphasises the need for demand driven research andthe development of technology in areas such as plantbreeding, crop improvement, hybrid seed development,integrated pest management, bio-pesticides and bio-fertiliserdevelopment, irrigation water management, soil fertilitymanagement, fiuit and floriculture development, and postharvest processing. The policy also attempts at streamliningextension services and improving the process of disseminationof infbrmation and technology.Other key reform areas identified in the NPAL are marketreforms, enhancing the lole of private entrepreneurship inagriculture, closer integration with the food processingindustry, and conservation and sustainable use of resources.In 2003, government efforts were focussed onproductivity improvement and crop diversification, developingmarketing infrastructure, increasing pr.ivate sectorparticipation, input management and agriculture pricestabilisation.With the intention of improving productivity and cropdiversification, CARP awarded in 2003 Rs.l 18 million for 83research projects conducted by different research institutions,universities and the private sector in areas of plant breeding,plant pathology, food technology, soil and fertiliserimprovement, agronomy, horticulture, and plant protection.To improve marketing infrastructure, two dedicatedeconomic centres were developed at Meegoda and Embilipitiyain 2003. Those centres provided a convenient trading floor forfarmers to sell their products to the retail and wholesale dealersdirectly, thereby realising a better price for their produce.

The delays in the availability of funds under the AsianDevelopment Bank's Plantation Development pLoject (pDp)for financing, hinde'ed the development of some tea estatesunder plantation companies.Tea expor-ts fi'om Sri Lanka, increased by 2 per cent to 29gmillion kg during 2003 incomparison to the previous year, dueto the running down of the carryover stocks from 2002. Thetotal expolt earnings from tea in rupee terms stood at Rs. 66billion (US dollars 683 million), indicaring an increase of 4.5per cent, compared to the previous year. The share of bulk teaexports declined from 64 per cent to 59 per cent due to aninctease in value added teas such as tea packets, tea bags andinstant tea. This resulted in an improvement of average expoltprice for tea in 2003.With a view to encouragin_e the development of the'Ready to Drink' (RTD) tea, the Sri Lanka Tea Board hasinitiated a financial assistance scheme by way of an inter-estsubsidy. Under this scheme, 50 per cent of the interest cost onloans obtained from banks or approved lending institutionsfor the procurement of necessary machinery to manufactureRTD teas is subsidised by the Sri Lanka Tea Board up to aperiod of five years. The maximum amount of the loan isRs. 20 million per project.The Tea Small Holdings Development Authoriry(TSHDA) continued to suppofr the rea smallholders byproviding necessary advisory and extension services andimplementing tea planting subsidy schemes together rvithspecial incentive scheme for replanting. The total subsidydisbursed to small holders tbr replanting, new planting andinfilling of tea amounted to Rs 157 million in 2003. Furrher, rheTHSDA continued the fertiliser distribution scheme under thecledit facilities for the benefit of smallholders.",

    "text": "For the second consecutive year, rubber production increasedthough marginally (1.6 percent) to 92 million kg in 2003.Attractive prices during the year encouraged growers toincrease tapping intensity to raise rubber production. However.,output increases fell fi'om the potential due to a greater numberof rainy days during 2003.There was a shift from crepe rubber to the manufacture ofsheet rubber in response to higher profit margins in producingsheet rubber. Consequently, sheet lubber output increased byL7 per cent and accounted for 54 per cent of the total outputcompared to 47 per cent reportedin2002. Crepe lubber outputdeclined by 14 per cent and accounted fbr 24 per cent of totaloutput compal'ed to 29 per cent in 2002.The upward trend in Colombo Auction prices, whichcommenced in April 2002, continued during 2003. TheColombo Auction price of all grades of rubber increased to thehighest lupee prices ever on record. The avera_{e auction pr.icesof all grades of RSS at the Colombo Auction increased by about50 per cent in rupee terms. The annual average prices of latexcrepe rose around 60 per cent.",

The low yield levels aremainly attributed to non application of recommended levels oft'ertrliser', poor usage of rain guards, poor usage of high yieldingclones, non adherence to systematic infilling practices, andscarcity of competent and skilled tappers, Most of the practicesmentioned above are directly related to the productivity andincome in the sector.

Export earnings fromcinnamon in primaty fbrm amounted to Rs 4.3 billion, whileeamings from cinnamon bark oil and leaf oil exports amountedto Rs 224 million. Thele has been a steady increase in ear.ningsfrom cinnamon exports in the recent years and it has becomethe third largest export agricultural crop, next to tea andcoconut since 1998, There is a considerable potential for SriLanka to increase value added exports from cinnamon insteadof exporting it as a primary product,According to provisional estimates, there was no chan,uein output of pepper compaled to the pr.evious year. However,the export volume declined by 2 per cent to 1,140 metric tons.Export price too was lower than the previous year, whichreduced the export earning from Rs 1.5 billion to Rs L2 billion.Clove production declined by about 42 per cent to 2,360metric tons in 2003. The drop in output is artributed to theinclement weather that prevailed in May in some parts ofRatnapura, Kalutara, Matara and Galle districts. The drop inproduction coupled with low export prices resulted in asignificant decline in the export earnings from cloves. Exportsof cloves declined by 38 per cent to 2.5 million kg, and theexport earnings dropped to Rs.575 million in 2003 from Rs 2.7billion in2002.",

DOA continued to assist the floriculture sectorby providing technical assistance, conducting trainingprogrammes, and issuing plant varieties though the NationalBotanical Gardens. EDB too assisted to develop the floriculturesector especially by providing advisory services to exportersand potential exporters by facilitating participation ininternational tlade fairs.The DEA continued to play a major role for thedevelopment of the export agriculture sector by implementingsubsidy schemes and providing necessary inputs, technicalinformation and extension services in cultivating andprocessing spices. However, the subsidies disbursed under theExpolt Agriculture Assistance Scheme declined further to Rs22.6 mlllion during 2003 due to lack of funds.

In contrast, the inland andaquaculture fish production increased by 7 .6 percent to 30,280metric tons in 2003.The drop in the marine sector output is partly due to theimposition of new laws that prohibited the use of certain typesof fishing gear. However, the negative impact of this policy isa temporary phenomenon, as these laws will ensuresustainability in the long run by reducing over exploitation ofmarine resources. The loss of fishing days due to bad weatherexperienced in the Southern and the North Western coastalareas during the months of May and June 2003 also adverselyaffected the marine fish production. However, policies andregulations applicable in the fisheries sector have to bereformed to attract private investment including foreigninvestment in order to ensure the long-term growth in theindustry. Improvement in inland and aquaculture fishproduction is mainly due to the increase in stocking fingerlingsin the inland reservoirs.The total volume of fish and fishery product exports,increased by 13.3 per cent to 14,714 metric tons in 2003.",
