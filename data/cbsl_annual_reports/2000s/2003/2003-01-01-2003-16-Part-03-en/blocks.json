In that case the swap should be marked to market with the resulting gain orloss recorded as an adjustment to the market value of designated asset or liability.(iii) Gains or losses on the termination of swaps should be recognised when the offsetting gain or loss isrecognised on the designated asset or liability. This implies that any gain or loss on the terminated swapwould be deferred and recognised over the shorter of the remaining contractual life of the swap or theremaining life of the asset/liabilitv.(iv)If a hedge is redesignated from one item of asset/liability to another item of asset/liability suchredesignation should be accounted for as the termination of one hedge and acquisition of another. Onthe date of redesignation the swap should be marked to market and the mark to market value would beamortised over the shorter period of the remaining life of the swap or remaining life of the asset/liability' The offsetting mark to market entry adjustments would be treated as premium received or paidfor hedge on the newly designated item of asset/liability and this would be amortised over the life of theredesignated asset/liability or remaining term of the swap whichever is shorter.(v) When a PD is acting like a broker for matching parties and is not a Principal to the contract itself, thenthe fee should be recognised immediately as an income. In case where the bank acts like a principal thefee should be amortised over the life of the conrract.",
