INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has continuously emphasised the importance of theinternal audit function as a vital component of an efficient internal control mechanism in banks. Internalauditing is defined as an "independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value andimprove an organisation's operations. It helps an organisation accomplish its objectives by bringing a

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2OOg(v)

Part lllMajor Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2003

systemic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, andgovernance processes".

An effective internal audit function within a bank would be a valuable source of information for bankmanagement and supervisors, as it would indicate the quality of the internal control system of the bank.

In the light of the foregoing, I am directed by the Monetary Board to ensure that all banks have aneffective internal audit function in place. Accordingly, all branches of Foreign Banks operating in Sri Lankaare hereby requested to ensure that an Internal Audit Unit of their own is established, or in the absence of thesame the Head Office or the Regional Office of such bank carries out an audit of the branch at least annually.

DISPLAY OF INTEREST RATES AND EXCHANGE RATES

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka welcomes the efforts made by banks to publish their deposit and lendingrates. You would no doubt appreciate that adequate market information is vital for improving marketefficiency and in promoting healthy competition.

As another step forward in this direction, all licensed commercial banks and specialised banks arerequested to compile a representative list of their interest rates on deposits and advances and their buying andselling rates for foreign currencies and to display such information to the general public in all branches andother banking outlets. You would recall that we agreed at an earlier Bank Managers' Meeting to follow thispractice, but it is observed that not all banks adequately do so.

All licensed commercial banks and specialised banks are informed that the display of interest rates andexchange rates of banks should commence from lst January,2OO4 the latest. A format suggested for thedisplay of information is enclosed herewith.

Please forward a copy of the list of interest rates and exchange rates displayed to this Departmentperiodically as and when it is revised.

The current repurchase and reverse repurchase facilities will also be available on overnightbasis as standing facilities for PIs which failed to meet their liquidity requirements at the auctions. Thecurrent discounting and rediscounting will be replaced by'outright selling'and'outright buying'. Thecollateral used in these transactions will continue to be Treasury bills and Treasury bonds.

Part lllMajor Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2003

This Direction is issued under Section 12 of the Regulations made by the Minister of Finance datedFebruary 1,2002 under the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance and the Registered Stocks and Securitiesordinance and will come into effect from April 1,2003.

ColomboApril 1,2003.K.G.D.D. Dheerasinghe

Superintendent of Public Debt

Financial derivatives such as Forward Rate Agreement (FRA) and Interest Rate Swaps (IRS) are usefulfor managing interest rates risks.

Description of the Product

l ' A Forward Rate Agreement (FRA) is a financial contract between two parties to exchange interestpayments for a 'notional principal' amount on settlement date, for a specified period from start date tomaturity date. Accordingly, on the settlement date, cash payments based on contract rate (fixed) and thesettlement rate, are made by the parties to one another. The settlement rate is the agreed bench-mark/reference rate prevailing on the settlement date.2' An Interest Rate Swap (IRS) is an agreement between two parties to exchange a stream of interestpayments for a 'notional principal' amount on multiple occasions during a specified period. Suchagreements generally involve the exchange or swapping of future fixed rate interest payments for futurefloating rate interest payments or the exchange of future floating rate interest payments for future floatingrate interest payments' Accordingly, on each payment date that occurs during the swap period, cashpayments based on the fixed/floating and floating rates, are made by the parties to one another.Participants3' Primary Dealers (PDs) can undertake FRAs/IRS as a product for their own balance sheet managemenrand for market making. PDs can offer these products to Licensed Commercial Banks, LicensedSpecialised Banks, Registered Finance Companies, Registered Leasing Companies, Registered lnsuranceCompanies, institutional investors and corporates for hedging their own balance sheet exposures.

Product Policy and Internal Control System4' Prior to undertaking FRAs/IRS, PDs are required to inform Public Debt Department (pDD), Central Bankof Sri Lanka and abide by such reporting and any prudential requirements as prescribed by the CentralBank of Sri Lanka, from time to time.5' PDs are required to ensure that appropriate infrastructure and risk management systems such as ability toprice the product and to "mark to market " their positions, monitor and limit exposures on an ongoingbasis, etc., are put in place.6' A copy of the document detailing Product Policy and Internal Control System should be submitted to thePublic Debt Department, Central Bank of Sri Lanka .

Types of FRAs/IRS

7 ' PDs can undertake different types of basic FRAs/IRS. Swaps having expliciUimplicit option features suchas caps/floors/collars are not permitted,

Bench Mark Rate8. The benchmark rate shall be the Treasury Bill or Treasury Bond rate

Size9' There will be no restriction on the minimum or maximum size of 'notional principal' amounts of FRAs/IRS' Norms with regard to size are expected to emerge in the market with the development of theproduct.

Gentral Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2OO3( xlix )

Part lllMajor Administrative Measures Adopted by the Monetary Board in 2003

Tenor

10. There will be no restriction on the minimum or maximum tenor of the FRAs/IRS.

Capital Adequacy

I l. PDs are required to maintain capital for FRAs/IRS, as per the stipulations contained in Annex I .

Exposure LimitstZ. ln order to set exposure limits for counterparties, PDs may apply the conversion factors to notionalprincipal amounts as per the exposure method prescribed in Annex l.

13. Furthermore, while dealing with corporates and institutions other than Licensed Commercial Banks, PDs

should exercise due diligence to ensure that they are undertaking FRAs/IRS only for hedging their own

rupee balance sheet exposures. PDs are advised to also obtain a certificate from the authorised signatory/

signatories of corporate/s to the effect that the transactions undertaken by them are meant for hedging

balance sheet exposures only, i-e., size and tenor of the transactions undertaken are not in excess of their

underlying rupee exposures.

Swap Position

14. preferably, PDs should undertake FRAs/IRS only for hedging underlying genuine exposures. However,

recognising the crucial role played by the market maker in development of the product and creating of the

market itself, PDs have been allowed to undertake market making activity, which would involve at times

dealing in the market without underlying exposure. However to ensure that market makers do not over

extend themselves, market makers are required to place prudential limits on swap positions, which may

arise on account of market making activity.

Accounting and Valuation

15. Transactions for hedging and market making purposes should be recorded separately. While transactionsfor market mqking purposes should be "marked to market" (at least at weekly intervals), those forhedging purposes could be accounted for on accrual basis. PDs should adopt accounting treatment on

the basis of the International Accounting Standards (IAS 32 & 39 ). PDs may refer to Annex 2.

Documentation

16. For uniformity and standardisation, PDs should use International Swap Dealers Association ( ISDA)documentation, as suitably modified to comply with these Directions for undertaking FRAs/IRS

transactions. Institutions should further evaluate whether the counterparty has the legal capacity, power

and authoritv to enter into FRAs/IRS transactions.

Reporting

17. PDs are required to report, as per the proforma indicated in Annex - 3 their FRAs/IRS operations on a

monthly basis to Public Debt Department, Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

18. These directions are intended to form the basis for development of Rupee derivative products such as

FRAs/IRS in the country. The directions are subject to review, on the basis of development of FRAs/IRS

market.

Annex Icapital Adequacy for Primary Dealers on Interest Rate contracts for credit Risk

Primary Dealers undertaking Forward Rate Agreements and Interest Rate Swaps, will be required tofu lfi I I the fo llowing minimum capi ta ll capital adequacy req uirements :Over and above the minimum capital requirements and the capital adequacy ratio required hy theDirection on Capital Adequacy, Primary Dealers wilt have to maintain additional capital at 12 per cent ofRisk Weighted Assets (RWA) towards credit risk on Interest Rate Contracts.

The methodology for these off-balance sheet items will be as follows :(i) The notional principal amount will be multiplied by the conversion factors given below to arriveat the adjusted value.

@ 0.5 per cent of notional principal value for original maturity of less than I year.@ 1.0 per cent for original maturity of one year and less than two years.@ 1.0 per cent for each additional year.(ii) The adjusted value thus obtained shall be multiplied by the risk weight applicable to the counterparty as specified below.Primary Dealers/Licensed Commercial BanksAll others

Lnnex 2Accounting Norms

Accounting for Hedge SwaE(i) Interest Rate Swap which hedges interest bearing asset or liability should generally be accounted forlike the hedge of the asset or liability.(ii) The Swap that is accounted for like a hedge should be accounted for on accrual basis except the swapdesignated with an asset or liability that is carried at market value or lower of cost or market value inthe financial statements. In that case the swap should be marked to market with the resulting gain orloss recorded as an adjustment to the market value of designated asset or liability.(iii) Gains or losses on the termination of swaps should be recognised when the offsetting gain or loss isrecognised on the designated asset or liability. This implies that any gain or loss on the terminated swapwould be deferred and recognised over the shorter of the remaining contractual life of the swap or theremaining life of the asset/liabilitv.(iv)If a hedge is redesignated from one item of asset/liability to another item of asset/liability suchredesignation should be accounted for as the termination of one hedge and acquisition of another. Onthe date of redesignation the swap should be marked to market and the mark to market value would beamortised over the shorter period of the remaining life of the swap or remaining life of the asset/liability' The offsetting mark to market entry adjustments would be treated as premium received or paidfor hedge on the newly designated item of asset/liability and this would be amortised over the life of theredesignated asset/liability or remaining term of the swap whichever is shorter.(v) When a PD is acting like a broker for matching parties and is not a Principal to the contract itself, thenthe fee should be recognised immediately as an income. In case where the bank acts like a principal thefee should be amortised over the life of the conrract.

The following should be used as general principles for accounting of trading transactions.(t) Trading swaps should be marked to market with changes recorded in the income statement.(ii) Income and expenses relating to these swaps should be recognised on the settlement date.(iii) Fees should be recognised as immediate income or expenditure.(tv) Gains or losses on the termination of the swaps should be recorded as immediate income or expenses.

Disclosures

The following should be disclosed in the note to the balance sheet:. the notional principal of swap agreements;. nature and terms of the swaps including information on credit and market risk and the accounting policiesadopted for recording the swaps;. quantification of the losses which would be incurred if counterparties failed to fulfil their obligation underthe agreement;. collateral required by the entity upon entering into swaps;. any concentration of credit risk arising from the swaps. Examples of concentration could be exposures toparticular industries or swaps with highly geared companies; and. the "fair" value of the total swaps book. If the swaps are linked to specific assets, liabilities orcommitments, the fair value would be estimated amount that the entity would receive or pay to terminatethe swap agreements at balance date. For a trading swap the fair value would be its mark to market value.
