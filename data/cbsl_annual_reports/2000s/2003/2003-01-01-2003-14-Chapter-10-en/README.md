FINANCIAL SECTOR

10.1 Overview

The flnancial sector, supported by the broadbased lecovery ineconomic activity in 2003, recorded an improvedperformance, raising its profitability and stlengthening its

resilience. The Central Bank reduced its policy rates further,taking into account the steady decline in inflation, lowerinflationary expectations, decline in the borrowingrequirement of the government, stability in the foreign

exchange market and falling interest rates in international

markets. With regard to monetary management, the CentralBank moved to more active Open Market Operations inMarch 2003 enabling it to manage market liquidity moreeffectively, while encouraging financial institutions toimplove liquidity management. This helped to reduce thevolatility of sholt [et'm money market lates, while achieving

the base money tar-eets. Both rupee and domestic foreign

exchange mar-kets lemained liquid throughout the year, which

made possible a further decline in market interest rates. The

Central Bank continued its efforts to make monetary policy

operations more tt'ansparent, which improved credibility andpredictability of the monetary policy stance. Meanwhile,

measures wele also taken to improve the stability and satety

of the payments and settlement system with the establishmentof a Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system, whichwould help to minimise settlement rrsks arnd increaseefficiency in money mat'ket activity. Background work on

moving to a Scripless Seculities Settlement (SSS) system in

govetnment securities continued during the year, in order to

commence operations in 2004. Reflecting the faster l'ecovery

in the economy and the decline in interest rates, operations in

the banking sector expanded, while the capital fund base of

commercial banks improved. The soundness of the financial

system also improved with the fuLther strengthening of

prudential regulations, reduction in non-performing assets,the resolution of difficulties in weaket banks and the

dissemination of more information on banking and financialinstitutions. An upsurge in stock market activity, brought

about by greater investot'confidence, resulted in several keymarket indicators retrching record levels during the year,

though some reversal of these trends was seen towards the

end of the year due to market uncertainty as a result ofpolitical developments,

The business activities of non bank financial institutions

such as leasing firms, tlnance companies, merchant banks,

also recorded improved perfbrmance due to economic growth

and improved confidence. The insurance industry also saw

new developments that would contribute to raising theprevailing low insutance penetration in the country,Meanwhile the government has almost entirely moved out of

diLect involvement in the insurance industly. A numbet of

Iegislative enactments relating to the financial sector were

being drafted in order to improve regulatory oversight and

facilitate greater competition while keeping abreast of malket

developments.However, a concerted effort would need to be

continuously made to further strengthen the resilience of the

financial system, In particular, steps would need to be taken

to reduce non-performing loans of banks as well as to reducethe hi-eh interest rate spread of the banking sector by

promotin,u competition. Fulther, it would be necessary toimprove the domestic bond market through greater

competition and plomote further deepening of the financral

market.

10.2 Monetary Policy

Monetary policy in 2003 tbcussed on nchieving a sustainablepath of lorv inflation, while facilitating the recovet'y in

economic activity. The economy expelienced high inflation,coupled with negative economic ,urowth in 2001 Thisadverse trend revelsed to some extent in 2002 withmoderation in inflation and positive economic,srowth.

Hence, the challenge before the Centlal Bank in 2003 was tofurther strengthen the economic recovery, while bt'inginginflation to still further low levels. The monetary poticy

stance in 2003 was directed towards achreving this goal.Accordingly, key policy interest rates were cautiously

lowered further in several steps during the year with a view to

supporting the economic recovery, while preventing the build

up of rntlationary pressul'es. Also, the Central Bank moved to

mole active open market opet'ations (OMO) in March 2003,further improving mzirket orientation in monetary

management.The Central Bank, in keeping with its policy ofcontaining inflation, cautiously reduced its Repurchase(Repo) and Revelse Repurchase (Revelse Repo) rates fultherby 275 - 325 basis points in 2003 and narrowed the mar'-ein

between the Bank's Repo and Resetve Repo rates by 50 basis

points. The reduction in policy rates in 2003 was preceded by

a reduction of 225 basis points in these rates in 2002.A number of factors facilitated this continuous reduction inpolicy rates: the continuing decrease in inflation andinflationary expectations, the containment of the monetary

expansion to the desired levels, the low growth in public

sector bolrowings, the availability of excess rupee riquidity,the relative stability in the foreign exchange markets, and thedownward movements in some international inte'est rates.The Repo and Reverse Repo rates were reduced in fbur steps,in January, May, August, and October. The Bank rate(i.e., the late applicable for lending to commercial banks asthe lender of last resort) was also reduced fiom 18.00 per-centto 15.00 per cent to keep it in line with the trends in thecent'al Bank's other policy rates. In view of the reducedvolatility in money market rates, and the downward shiftingof the interest late structule, lhe width of the corridor formedby the Bank's Repo and Reserve Repo r.ates was reduced to150 basis points from 200 basis points. The reduction inpolicy interest rates resulted in a reduction in all other marketrates, although some lending rates were slow in adjusting,causing the interest rate spread to rise. A fastel decline ininflatron has resulted in a rise in some market interest ratesin real terms. The Central Bank has taken measures roimprove the interest rate pass-through in the banking indusrry(see Box l9).The Central Bank has been taking steps to improve the,etfectrveness of its monetary policy. As a part of this process,the Bank moved to a more active system of open marketoperations (OMO), fl'om 03 March, 2003. Under this system,the Central Bank would decide on the quanrum of riquidity tobe supplied ol withdrawn, but the interest rates would bedetermined by the market iorces, However, fbr the market rodetermine the appropriate rate, the interest rate corridorformed by the Bank's Repo and Reverse Repo rates wouldsrgnal the direction of the policy stance. Active OMO arecaLried out through daily auctions to inject or absorb riquiditybased on the monetary policy stance and the estimated marketliquidity. This is in contrast to the earlier.system, where therate was fixed by the Central Bank, while the volume wasdetermined by the market. Under the new active OMO, tohelp the market to ope'ate smoothly, standing facilities arealso available to market participants at Repo/Reverse Reporates, so that they could square up any excess/shorttall inmarket liquidity. Under the new monetary policymanagement system there is greater public disclosure as theBank's monetary policy stance is announced monthly as peran advance release calendar. These regular announcementshave enhanced transparency and credibility of monetarymanagement, while enhancing the predictability of theBank's policy stance. This more active system of OMOhas helped to achieve greater stability in money market rates(see Box 4).Under the system of more active OMO, the CBSL tookmeasures to absorb a part of the excess liquidity on along-term basis, as this improves the eftectiveness of OMOand helps to reduce transaction costs of banks in investingexcess liquidity on an overnight basis. Accordingly, sales ofTreasu'y bills were made by calling dealer bids directly andthrough auctions. As the CBSL holdings of government

securities declined, the CBSL issued its own securities roabsorb excess liquidity. CBSL securities worth a total ofRs.3.8 billion were issued in September 2003. The maturitiesof these securities were fixed between 60 to 9l days, asliquidity was expected to decline by December.The method of computing the statutory reservesmaintained by commercial banks with the Central Bank waschanged with effect from 03 April 2003. The basis ofcomputing requrred resel'ves was changed to the avet'agevalue of deposit liabilitres and vault cash durin-e a week,instead of the balances on a single working day, as in the past.This change has helped to improve the eff'ectiveness of thestatutoly reserve requlrement as an instrument of monetarypolicy and enabled more erccurate estimation of daily marketIiquidity, which is vital tbr the efflcient working of OMO.As an integral part of makrng its monetary policyoperatrons more transparent, the Bank enhanced thedissemination of information on monetary policy to themarket, A key change during the year rvas the publication ofan advance release calendar, announcing the dates of changesin the monetary policy stance. With the commencement ofactive OMO, a monthly statement on the Central Bank'smonetary policy stirnce has been made public, _uiving reasonsfor the policy decisions, in order to incl.ease marketawareness and improve financial market stability. In addition,monetal'y projections, along wtth the explanatory notes wereposted on the Central Bank's website, The Bank continued toprovide data on a re_tular basis to market participants to keepmarket participants bettet' infbrmed regarding monetary andothel mal-ket developments,The Centlal Bank continued to adopt a monetarytargetting framewolk with reserve money as the marnoperating talget. The glearer stability in the fbreign exchangemarket consequent on the implementation of an independentfloating exchange rate regime from 2001 was helpful inconducting monetary policy more eftectively. The limit onforeign cunency net open positions (NOP) of commer-cialbanks, based on capital funds, was increased, with a view tofurther improving the depth and flexibility of the foreignexchange market. Although there was a significant increasein net foleign assets, reserve money was maintained withinthe target with a compensating reduction in net domesticassets of the Centlal Bank, Changing the basis of computingSRR raised the level of reserve money,l Reserve money,however, was high throughout most of December, partly dueto hi-eher currency demand associated with marketuncertainty. Monetary growth, which was around l2-13 percent, until September, increased above the projected growthpath towards the end of the year, posing some challenges tofuture monetary management.

1. The amount of vaule cash, eligible to be counted as a part ofrequired reserves, declined when averaged, in comparison to thelevel maintained under the previous method, thereby raising thelevel of reserves to be maintained by banks at the Central Bank.

A number of policy initiatives were taken during theyear to increase the efficiency, integrity and stability of thefinancial sector, which would improve the transmissionmechanism of monetary policy. The CBSL took measures toestablish RTGS/SSS systems to upgrade and expand thepayment and settlement system, and thereby to minimise therisks involved in this system, The capital position ofcommercial banks improved as the minimum risk weightedcapital adequacy ratios (CARs) rvere raised and banks wererequired to compute the CAR to cover the operations offoreign currency banking units (FCBUs) as well. Longer-term Treasury bonds were issued, which would facilitatedeveloping a long-term or benchmark yield curve for pricingseculities in other markets. As the development of thegovernment securities market is essential for the conduct ofmarket oriented monetary policy, the Colombo StockExchange (CSE) was given access to the SSS system. Thiswould help enhance secondary market activity in governmentsecurities and facilitate secondary trading through a debt

exchange. The CBSL actively engaged in conducting a public

awareness campaign on the details of approved financialinstitutions and the type of financial services provided by

these institutions, Several legislative enactments were draftedto further strengthen the financial sector legal framework.

10.3 Money and Credit Aggregates

Reserve Money

Reserve money, was maintained within the projected targetsthroughout 2003 which in turn helped to maintain the moneysupply targets. The management of reserve money wasfacilitated by the introduction of active OMO, which alsocontributed to achieve greater stability in call market interestrates. During 2003, reserve money, which comprises

currency notes and coins issued by the CBSL and deposits ofcommercial banks with the Central Bank, rose by Rs.l5billion (12 per cent), as compared to a little lower rise ofRs.l4 billion (12 per cent) in 2002. The increase in reservemoney was mainly reflected in the currency in circulation,which increased by Rs.10 billion. Increased transactionsdemand due to the improvement in economic activity,including new economic activities in the North and East thatbenefitted from the ceasefire agreement, was the maincontributory factor tbr the rise in the demand for currency.The debit tax on deposit withdrawals is also likely to have

encouraged greater holdings of cun'ency to some degree. Theother component of reserve money, i.€,, deposits ofcommercial banks with the CBSL, rose by Rs,5 billion, as a

result of an inclease in deposits of commercial banks, againstwhich reserves are maintained.As for the contributory factors for the increase in reservemoney, it was exclusively due to an increase in CBSL's netforeign assets (NFA) partly offset by a reduction in itsdomestic assets. The rise in NFA due to increased foreisn

inflows amounted to Rs.47 billion. During 2003, the NetDomestic Assets of the CBSL declined due to the reductionof the Central Bank's holdings of Treasury bills by Rs.29billion, in comparison to a decline of Rs.l8 billion in 2002.Reserve money increased by Rs.l5 billion and reachedRs,14l billion by end December, as against the target ofRs.l43 billion,

driven by higher net foreign assets of the banking system andhigher private sector credit. The improvement in net foreignassets of the banking system benefitted from the Bopsurplus, and the increase in private sector credit, was fuelledby a broad based recovery in ail major economic sectors,improved consumer demand and the decline in interest rares,Meanwhile' narrow money (Mt), which comprises currencyand demand deposits herd by ttre pubric, increased at aslightly higher rate of l6 per cent by end December, due toincreases in both curency and demand deposits.Factors Affecting Monetary Growth _ MznThe NFA of the banking system increased further in 2003,and was the major contributory factor to the growth inconsolidated broad money supply (MzJ (59 per cent of theoverall expansion). NFA of the bantiing system rose byaround Rs.56 billion during 2003 as a result of higher foreignremittances, increased receipts under services and capitalflows to both the government and the private sector includingthe receipt of foreign grants and loans. The increase waslargely (82 per cent) reflected in the NFA of the centralBank, which rose by Rs.47 billion, reflecting the surplus ofUS dollars 502 million in the Bop. NFA of commercialbanks too improved by Rs.9 biltion, partly as a result oftncreased investment in foreign currency assets abroad, fiomthe proceeds of the repayment of sri Lanka DevelopmentBonds (sLDBs) amounting ro US doilars l5g milrion, whichare treated as domestic assets in the monetary survey.Net credit to government (NCG) from the bankingsystem declined for the second consecutive year, reflectingimproved fiscal management and commitment to fiscalconsolidation. NCG declined by Rs,l7 billion in 2003following the decline of Rs,8 billion inz00z. The reductionin government liabilities to the banking sector was facilitatedby the containment of the government's borrowingrequirement, availabirity of foreign resources throughprogramme and project loans, and the receipt of privatisationproceeds. The repayment of government borrowings whichhad been effected earlier in2002 to the banking system was acommendable achievement since, it reinforced the monetary

policy measures taken by the CBSL in containing inflationand releasing funds for use by the private sector to facilitatefuture economic growth. This was the first occasion in therecent past where both monetary policy and fiscal policyworked in tandem with each other, of the uS dollars 250million raised in 2001 and 2002 through SLDBs, rhegovernment settled thlee tranches in November andDecember 2003, totalling US dollars l5g million, Rupeetunds for this purpose were raised marnly through the issue ofgovernment paper. The holdings of government securities bycommercial banks increased by Rs. 45 billion, althoughfbreign bills declined by Rs. l2 billion.Credit to public corporations which was a maiordestabilising factor as far as monetary managern.ni i,concerned in earlier years, too declined by Rs.6.g billion,with a reduction in credit to ceylon petr.oleum corporation(cPC), ceylon Electriciry Board (cEB) and the sertlemenr ofliabilities of the co-operative wholesale Establishment(cwE) to the banking system through the issue of rreasurybonds by the govemment. credit to cpc declined with somereduction in international oil prices by mid-year, automaticpri mproving CpC's cash flow and the receiptof vatisation proceeds from the sale of a partof Lanka Indian Oil Company. Meanwhile,cEB was able to reduce its borrowings from the bankingsector with the termination of the generation of some highcost thermal power, and an increase in the relative share ofhydropower, However, the decline in credit to publiccorporations was lower than envisaged due to a slight delay inthe receipt of the balance privatisation proceeds of the cpc,which were received in Januarv 2004.

The pick up in credit to the private sector fromcommercial banks that was seen in 2002 continued, andaccelerated towards end 2003. credit to the private sectorincreased by Rs.75 billion during the period under review, asagainst an increase ofpoint to point growth17 per cent at end Decent by June 2003 and

credit to the private sector was in response to the ongoing

broadbased recovery in the economy, increased consumer

demand and the decline in interest rates. Increased capital

funds and some decline in NPLs provided a further cushion

tbr banks to expand the supply of credit. Although the largest

increase in credit has been from private domestic banks, there

has also been an increase in credit by the two state banks, in

contrast to a decline in such cledit in the previous year,

augmenting the overall credit growth. The increase in credit

to the private sector was mainly from DBUs of commercial

banks, which extended credrt to the export and lmport trade,tourism, power and to indrviduals fbr housing and consumer

durables and consumption purposes,The money supply is the product of both the money

multiplieL (the number of times which commercial banks can

create multiple deposits and credit) and reserve money (base

money cleated by the CBSL through its operations). During

2003, both tactols contributed to the glowth in money supply.

Reserve money incleased by Rs.l5 billion, while the money

muf tiplier incleased from 4.92 in 2002 to 5.08 in 2003.A risrng relative shar-e of foreign currency deposits and a

declining ratro of currency to deposits enabled banks to createmore deposits and credit thus becoming the majorcontributoly factor for the rise in the money multiplier.As foreign currency deposits are not subject to SRR, the

effective SRR decreases with an inctease in the relative shareof forei-en currency deposits, resulting in a rise in themultiplier, In addition, the currency to deposlt ratio also

declined gradually dulin-e this period with the improvementin banking faciltties and greater use of electronic payment

methods. Meanwhile, the income velocity of money declinedfurther during the year, due to a decline in inflationlry

expectations, an increase in financial assets with improved

business and consumer confidence, and deepening of

financial markets.In terms of the composition of bload money supply fi'omthe demand side, all three components, viu., currency,

demand deposits and savings deposits, grew at a higher pace

during the year, reflecting higher transaction demand wrth the

improvements to economic activity. Within the deposits, theshare of savings deposits increased further, with acotresponding decline in term deposits. The decline ininterest rates and continued efforts of banks to mobrlise

savings deposits from different segments of the economywith added teatures could be key considerations in increasedpreference of the public for savings deposits over time

deposits. Foreign cunency deposits incleased further byUS dollars 139 milliorr in 2003, following an increase of

US dolfars ll7 million in2002, increasing the total tbreigncurrency deposit base to US dollars 1,415 million. The

improvement in market confidence, stability in exchange

rates, and home-bias in view of a favourable interest rate

diff'ere nti al vis-d- r,i.i i nternational i nteres t rates contributed to

enhance the foreign cuilency deposit base.

by Rs.26 billion. However, this trend is not to create any

adverse development since the NSB and other LSBs simply

recycle private sector savings into the government sector

without creating multiple deposits and cledit.A higher increase in credit to the plivate sector was seenin 2003, with increased credit from LSBs and finance

companies. LSBs have granted loans mainly fbr agriculture,

manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade and to financialinstitutions for equity financing and venture capital

financing. Meanwhile, the major share of loans from finance

companies has been extended for leasing in 2003. Credit to

the private sector in the financial survey increased by alound

Rs.96 billion in 2003 as against an increase of Rs.53 billion in

2002. On a point to point basis, credit to the private sector

increased by 16.8 per cent in Mo at end December 2003,following an increase of 10.4 pel cent increase recorded by

end 2002. In comparison, the growth in credit to the plivate

sector in M25 was 16.9 per cent as at end 2003.

10.5 Interest Rates

The move towards a low interest rate regime fiom the legacyof high interest rates in the past continued further during

2003, reflecting the reduction in policy lates. excess marketliquidity, decline in inflationary expectations, and thereduction in the domestic borrowing requirement of the

govelnment. With the commencement of more active openmarket operations of the Central Bank, an important

development in the interest structure was the setting up of an

interest late corridor formed by the Repo and Reverse Repo

rates, the changes of which would signal the direction of

monetary policy and would guide short-term interest rates.

As commented earlier', the Repo and Reverse Repo rates

were revised downward four times during the year. The Bank

Rate was also reduced during 2003, in line with the reductionin other interest rates. These reductions in policy rates,

together with the improved market liquidity, caused a fall inmalket interest rates. Sholt-term rates, such as call market

rates and the prime lending rate, crosely foilowed thereductions in the policy rates. These deveropments, togetherwith reduced borrowing by the government and declininginflationary expectations, caused the yield rates on marketoriented government securities to decrease. The yierd curvetbr-government securities by end 2003 was t'latter and lowerthan the yield curve at end 2002, indicating marketexpectations of lower inflation in the medium-term. In spiteof the fall in nominal rates, most rear interest rates remainedpositive in 2003, as inflation continued to fall throughout theyear' International market rates also continued to decline.particularly in the first half of 2003, causing interest rates onforeign currency deposits and rending to decline. Towar-ds theend of the year, there was some reversal in the decline indomestic short-term interest rates due to market uncertainty.Yield rates on Treasury bills, as weil as rates in the cailmoney market, were affected due to these disturbances,Although most rending rates decrined somewhat fasrerthan deposit rates in 2003, interest rate spreads still remainedhigh. The high interest rate spreads are a symptom of

inadequate competition in the financial mar.kets, highoperational costs and large costs involved in themodernisation of financiar services and facilities. Relativelyhigh non-performing loans of some commerciar banks causedby unsound credit management practices, as weil as derays inthe legal process against defaurters, contributed to asignificant part of the high spreads between deposit andlending rates,Taxation of the financial sector has undergone a series ofchanges in the recent past, sometimes creating distortionaryeffects on the interest rate structure. Since 2002, new taxessuch as the Debits tax and vAT had been introduced, whilethe stamp duty, turnover tax and the National Security Levvwere abolished. Beginning March 2002, interest ongovernment seculities was also made subject to withholdingtax at the rate of l0 per cent, to be charged at source.Subsequently a notionar tax credit on investment ingovernment securities was g ing some distortionin the money market, A chan ng principle relatedto rnterest earnings was in Budget 2004.

Accordin-{ly, the present exemption limit of Rs.9,000 per

month or Rs.108,000 per year for the withholding tax on

interest income per deposit were applied to the total interest

income from all deposits in any indivldual bank or financialinstitution made by a person or a corporate entity. Another

significant fiscal measure was the introduction of a Debits taxon demand deposits and certificates of deposit with

commelcial banks. In Budget 2003, the coverage of theDebits tax was further extended to savings deposits with

licensed commet'cial banks and licensed specialised banks,

reducing the eftbctive return on these deposits' Furthermore,government imposed a VAT on the financial sector,

computed as l0 per cent of total net profits of commercial

banks and tlnancial sectol institutions and emoluments paid

to all the employees, which also may have negatively affected

the reduction in intelest rate spreads.

Central Bank Policy Rates

The Central Bank's key monetary policy rates iire the

Repurchase rate (Repo), the Reverse Repurchase (Reverse

Repo) rate, and the Bank Rate. The first two are closely

linked to market rates, while the latter is more an indicative

late. The Repo rate is the rate at which commercial banks andprimary dealers can invest their surplus funds in Treasuly

bonds and Treasury bills held by the CentLal Bank, while the

Reverse Repo rate is the rate at which commercial banks andprimary dealers can obtain funds from the Central Bank by

pledging their own holdings of Tteasury bills and Treasury

bonds with the Central Bank.

Chan-ses in Repo and Reverse Repo rates under theOMO are the Central Bank's signalling mechanism to

indicate the expected dilection of interest lates in the market,

Moreover, with the commencement of more active openmarket operations in March 2003, these rates formed thecorlidor within which the overnight market operated, as

standing facilities were made available to participants either

at the Repo rate or Reverse Repo rate, depending on their

liquidity requirements.The Repo tate was reduced by 275 basis points, while

the reduction in the Reverse Repo rate was by 325 basispoints, during 2003, taking into account developments in

inflation, lower borrowing by the government continuedstability in money and foreign exchange markets, and the

decline in international intetest rates. The Repo rate and the

Reverse Repo rate, which weLe 9.75 per cent and ll'75 peL

cent, respectively, at end 2002 were reduced by 75 basis

points to 9.00 per cent and I1.00 per cent on 07 January 2003.

Rates were reduced by a further 75 basis points on 09 May

2003.In the second half of the year, consumer price inflation

continued to fall, creating room for the Central Bank to

reduce the pohcy rates futther. On l5 Au-eust 2003, the rates

were reduced again by 75 basis points. On l6 October 2003,

the rates were further cut by 50 basis points and 100 basis

points respectively, bringing the rates down to 7.00 per cent

and 8.50 per cent, and narrowing the interest rate corridor.

Fufthermore, the Bank Rate, i.e-, the rate at which the

Central Bank grants advances to commercial banks to meet

their temporary iiquidity requirements, which had remained

unchanged at 18.00 pet'cent since December 2001, was also

reduced to 15.00 per cent on 15 August 2003, to keep it in

line with the changes in other interest rates.Most international interest rates declined marginallyfrom the levels at end 2002, which were already low. Fot'

example, the US Federal Funds rate, which was 1.25 per cent

at the beginntng of the year, was leduced to 1.00 per cent by

July 2003. The European Centtal Bank (ECB) also reducedits policy rates by 50 basis points in March 2003 and by

25 basis points in June 2003. Accordingly, the rate on the

main refinancing fircility of ECB, which was 2.15 per cent at

the beginning of the year, was 2.00 per cent by end 2003. The

Bank of En-eland reduced its Repo rate from 4'00 pet cent to

3.75 per cent in Febluary 2003, and further to 3.50 per cent in

July 2003. However, it incLeased its Repo rate to 3.75 pet

cent in November 2003, to curtail possible inflationaLy

impacts.

Money Market Rates

The money market remained liquid in 2003, as mentioned

earlier. Malket participants invested this excess liquidity in

the Central Bank's Repo facility. Accordingly, call marketrates closely followed the Central Bank's Repo t'ate

throughout the year. Call market rates exhibited greater

stability. The valiation of call market rates, as measured by

the standat'd deviation of the average call money rate, which

was 4.2 per cent in 2001, declined to 0.8 per cent in 2002, and

remained at that level in 2003. Call maLket rates, which were

The operating costs of manybanks are high. Heavy investment in IT, highexpenditure on salaries and emoluments, as well asseculity, and under performing branches contribute toraising operational costs. The opertting costs couldalso increase due to the type of market segment onu'hich a bank concentrates. For instance, if a bankrelies more on small scale customers or retail

custom-ers, that bank ivould need a larger number ofbranches, personnel and equipment, all of which laisethe operational costs.. l,lon-performing loans: The non-perfolmin_u loans(NPLs) which ale non earnin-e assets remarn high inmany banks, requinng higher provisions.. Lortg-term deposits mobilised at J'ixed rates: Ingeneral, banks clffer fixed rate time deposits.

marginal increases in November and December 2003, due to

the disturbances on the political tiont as well as the seasonal

demand in December. By the end of the year, call market

rates were between 7.38 and 8.50 per cent, and the average

rate was 7.59 per cent,In view of the excess liquidity in the market, the Central

Bank conducted repurchase auctions throughout the year. The

average weighted rate at the daily Repo auctions remained

close to the Central Bank Repo rate. The average weighted

rate, which was 9,26 per cent on 03 March, declined to 9.13

per cent by end March, and with the reduction of policy rates,

declined to 8.30 per cent by June, 7.58 per cent by September,

and to 7.04 per cent by December 2003. Market participants

also continued to access the Repo standing facility, whilethere were a few Reverse Repo transactions as well,

reflecting the existence of some institutional limitations in the

market.The Central Bank's discount and rediscount rates,

i,e., the rates applicable to outright purchases and sales of

Treasury bills by commercial banks and primary dealers

through the Central Bank's secondary market window,

moved down with market interest rates. The discount margin

between the primary market yield and the CBSL Repo rate

was reduced to 25 basis points from 125 basis points, rvith

effect from 28 January 2003, and further to 5 basis points on

I I February. However, with the commencement of active

OMO in March 2003, these rates became non-operative.The Sri Lanka Inter Bank Offered Rates (SLIBOR)'

which are based on the rates offered for rupee inter bank

transactions by l2 commercial banks, also declined with the

reduction in Repo rate and showed a downward trend similar

to that of the call market rates. The overnight SLIBOR, which

was 10.67 per cent at end 2002, reached its lowest level of

7,55 per cent on 17 October 2003, and was 1.73 per cent by

end year. The one-year SLIBOR declined tiom I1.33 per cent

at end December 2002 to 7.84 per cent at end December

2003.By end 2003, the secondary market yield curve for

government securities was flatter and was positioned lowerthan the yield curve at end 2002, indicating market

expectations of lower inflation in the medium term. The

decline in yield rates is attributed to the reduced supply ofgovernment securities, with the continuation of fiscalconsolidation in 2003, market appetite for long tenor

government securities and market expectations of a further

decline in yield rates. Meanwhile, the government issuedl0-year, l5-year and 20-year Treasul'y bonds in 2003,

developing a benchmark yield curve.

Lending and Deposit Rates

In line with the changes in the Central Bank policy lates and

other market interest rates the deposit and lending rates ofcommercial banks also declined. Although some lending

rates, rates on lending to prime customers in palticular,

declined faster than deposit rates, the lending rates as a whole

were not reduced as much as anticipated. Rates on overdraftsof corporate clients and personal clients declined sharply,while rates on export financing facilities and on importfinancing facilities in 2003 also declined. The weighted

average prime lending rate (AWPR), the weighted average

rate of commercial banks' mostly short-term lending to theirprime customers, which was 12.24 per cent at end 2002,

declined to its lowest level of 8.80 per cent by mid December,

but similar to previous years, increased during the Christmas

season. The AWPR was 9,26 per cent by end 2003.

Interest rates on savings deposits and tixed deposits also

declined during the year. The average weighted deposit rate(AWDR), which is a weighted average of the rates on all

outstanding interest bearing deposits of commercial banks,

declined from l.4l per cent in December 2002, to 6.00 per

cent by June 2003, and to 5.27 per cent by December 2003. A

similar pattern was observed in the average weighted fixed

deposit rate (AWFDR), which declined from l0'17 per cent

in December 2002 to 7.11 per cent in December 2003'Following the decline in market rates, the National

Savings Bank (NSB) reduced its savings deposit rate three

times to be in line with the rest of the market. The savings

deposit rate, which was 6.00 per cent at the end of 2002, wasin fact increased to 6.5 per cent in August 2003.It was

reduced to 6.00 per cent in October and further to 5'00 per

cent in November 2003.The one-year fixed deposit rate,which was 9.00 per cent in December 2002, was reducedgradually in four steps to 7.00 per cent by end 2003.

However, in view of the reduction in deposit rates, NSB aswell as the two state banks introduced special deposit

schemes for senior citizens and retirees, where such persons

receive a higher rate of interest on deposits.

Interest rates charged by commercial banks onoutstanding payments through credit cards, which were in arange of 2L-33 per cent at end 2002, remained basicallyunchanged at end 2003. A few banks, however, did reducetheir rates on outstanding payments through credit cards.However, this is not to be viewed as an outlier from therest of the interest rate structure, since it is only a penalrate on those who do not settle their balances even after theone month's interest free credit provided to credit cardholders,A decline was seen in the Iending rates of rong-termcredit institutions, i.e., DFCC Bank, National DevelopmentBank (NDB), State Mortgage and Investment Bank (SMIB)and NSB. The lending rates of DFCC Bank were reducedfrom I1.50-19.00 per cent in December 2002 to around9'50-16'00 per cent at end 2003, whire the rending rates ofNDB had come down from l0.gl-1g.35 per cent to8.23-16.00 per cent during the same period. The rending ratesof sMIB and NSB, which were in rhe ranges of 15.00-r6.50per cent and 14.00-16.50 per cent, respectively, at end 2002,were 12.00-13.25 per cent and 10.00_ 12.00 per cenr,respectively, by end 2003.Following the declining trend in international marketrates, commercial banks in sri Lanka reduced their interestrates on foreign currency deposits and on fbreign currencylending. At end 2003, interest rates on us dollar denominatedsavings accounts were in the range of 0.40 to l.l5 per cent,while on sterling pound denominated savings accounts it was1'50 to 4.00 per cent. The interest rates applicable to lendingin us dolla's were in the range of z.z0 to g.00 per cent, whileon lending in sterling pounds, rates charged were between3.50-6.80 per cenr.

Rates on Short-Term Government paper

The general declining trend in interest rates was observedat the weekly Treasury bill auctions as well. The weightedaverage yields (excluding tax) on Treasury bills tell belowthe GBSL Repo rate of 9.75 per cent at the auctions inJanuary, indicating market expectations of a furtherreduction in cBSL rates. However, the market correcteditself and in February, the yield on Treasury bills increasedmarginally. The yields on 9l-day, lg}_day and 364_d,ayTreasury bills moved down from 9.92,9.g9 and 9.91 percent, respectively, at end December, 2002, to their lowestlevels of 7,06, 7.03, and 6.98 per cent, by the first week ofNovember. The reductions in policy rates, a reduced budgetdeficit, increased liquidity in the market, and the reductionin other market rates were factors that contributed to thisdecrease. However, the yields on 9l-day, lg2_day and 364_day Treasury bills increased to 7.35, 7.30, and 7.24 percent, respectively, by the end of the year, due to somechanges in market perceptions after the developments in thepolitical sphere.

Rates on Medium- and Long-TermGovernment Paper

Treasury bonds with shorter maturities were issued lessfrequently in 2003. In contrast, taking advantage of theprevalent low interest Lates, 4,5 and 6_year bonds, wereissued more frequently, while the long-term risk free yieldcurve was extended further with the commencement of theissue of l0-year and l5-year bonds in January 2003, andZ}-year bonds in ocrober 2003. This also facilitated theprogramme for reducing the bunching of debt repayment bythe government,With the reduction in policy rates, and the decline ininflationary expectations, Treasury bond rates also decreasedthroughout the year. Rates, which were close to I1.00 percent at end2002, declined across all maturities to single digitlevels by end January 2003. By end September, rates wereIess than 7.50 per cent, and had declined further when thegovernment borrowing programme ended in November,2003.

Rupee loans with call options, which carried high yieldrates, were recalled as a cost reduction strategy of thegovernment, while the first three tranches of the dollardenominated Sri Lanka Development Bonds amounting toUS dollars 158,5 million were retired upon maturity, inNovember and December 2003. Rupee loans with maturityperiods ranging f'om 2-5 years were issued during 2003.Interest rates on Rupee loans, which are administrativelydetermined, were 13.00 per cent at the beginning of the year,but were brought down to around 8.00 per cent by end 2003.

Rates on Corporate Debt securities

Rates on commercial paper, a short-term debt instrument,which were in the range of 10.50-16.50 per cent in 2002,came down to a range of 7.25-13.00 per cent in 2003.commercial Bank of ceylon Ltd. issued listed debentures onfwo occasions during the year. one issue carried an interestrate of 10 per cent, while the other had a floating rate.

The Legal Rate and the Market RateThe Legal Rate and the Market Rate applicable for thefollowing year are published in the Government Gazette bythe central Bank at the end of each year. The Legal Rate isdefined under the civil procedure code (Amendment) Act,No. 6 of 1990 and is applicable to any action for the recoveryof a sum of money. The Market Rate is defined under theDebt Recovery (Special provisions) Acr, No. 2 of 1990. TheMarket Rate is applied only in relation to actions instituted bylending institutions for the recovery of debt exceedingRs.150,000 arising out of commercial transactions, wherethere is no agreed rate of intercst.

10.6 Commercial Banking

The commercial banking sector continued to grow duling2003 reflecting the recovery in the economy. Althoughactivity in both the domestic banking units (DBUs) and thefbreign currency banking units (FCBUs) grew in 2003, thegrowth in activity of domestic banking units was much

higher. In contrast to the slow growth in 2002, both deposits

and advances of commercial banks grew substantially in

2003. An increase in utilisation of banking sector resources

by the private sector, particularly towards the end of the year,

was seen, while the dependence of the public sector on

banking resources decreased. The main contributol'y factols

that led to the growth in credit to the private sector were the

continuation of the ceasefire, the general reduction in market

interest rates, an improvement in business confidence and asatisfactory growth in external trade. Foreign currencyinflows to the commercial banks also increased with the

increase in toulist earnings, inflows to the stock market,

increase in private remittances and the expansion in foreign

cunency deposits. Consequently, foreign cunency resources

of commercial banks improved and they were able to sell part

of the fbreign cuffency inflows to the Central Bank. This, and

the settlement of some liabilities of the government to the

commercial banks lesulted in an increase in the excess rupeeliquidity in the market. There was about Rs.8-10 billion

excess liquidity in the market throughout the year, which was

mopped up through OMO by the Central Bank.The total number of commercial banks operating in Sri

Lanka declined from 23 at end Decembei 2002 to 22 at end

December 2003 with the absorption of the branch of oneforeign bank by another foreign bank during the year.Accordingly, the number of foreign banks declined to I l,while the number of domestic banks remained at I I at end

December 2003.Both the interest and non-interest income of commercial

banks continued to increase during the year. This resultedflom the improvement in banking activity noted above, aswell as the increase in the interest rate margin of banks with a

reduction in deposit rates at a faster rate than the reduction in

lending rates. Accordingly, profits of the commercial banks

increased by about 3l per cent in 2003, in comparison to the

increase in profit of 60 per cent in 2002.Total assets/liabilities of DBUs of commercial banksgrew by 12.3 per cent in 2003, in comparison to the 6.3 percent growth recorded in 2002. Total assets/liabilities of

FCBUs of commercial banks grew by I per cent in US dollar

terms in 2003, in contrast to the decline of 7 per cent recotdedin 2002. As the risk weighted capital adequacy requirement(CAR) of commercial banks was increased from 9 to I0 per

cent as a ratio of total capital and from 4.5 to 5 per cent as aratio of core capital with effect flom January 2003, some

commercial banks issued debentures during the year to meet

the new CAR.Liabilities of the govemment to the DBUs incr-eased byRs.l9 billion, whereas liabilities to the FCBUs declined by

Rs.7 billion in 2003, r'esulting in a net increase of Rs.l2billion on a consolidated basis. In comparison, government

Iiabilities to the commercial banks increased by Rs.5 billion

in2002. The increase in 2003 was mainly a net outcome of an

increase in holdings of government securities by DBUs due to

repurchase transactions with the Central Bank usin-q excessliquidity of banks and settlement of Sri Lanka Development

Bonds amounting to US dollars 158.5 million (around Rs.l5billion), held by both the DBUs and FCBUs.Meanwhile, outstanding credit to public corporations

from commercial banks declined by Rs.6.8 billion, though the

decline was lower than expected at the beginning of the year.This decline was a net outcome of an increase of Rs.0.9billion flom DBUs and a decline of Rs.7.7 billion from

FCBUs. The decline was in three major public corporations,ui:., Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), Co-operattve

Wholesale Establishment (CWE) and the Ceylon Electricity

Board (CEB). It was expected that a substantial amount ofCPC's Iiabilities would be settled through privatrsation

proceeds during 2003.I{owevet', it could repay only Rs.l.3billion of its loans as the full payment of the plivatisation

proceeds from the second player of the CPC opeLations(Lanka Indian Oil Company Ltd) was not received during

2003. The CEB settled only Rs,0.8 billion of its liabilities asits cash flow improved only marginally. Meanwhile,liabilities of CWE to commet'cial banks declined by about

Rs.5 billion, mainly due to the issue of government Treasury

bonds to commercial banks, amounting to Rs.4.4 billion,

replacing part of the CWE's liabilities.Deposit mobilisation of commercial banks grew at a

higher rate (13.6 per cent) in 2003 in comparison with 2002(10.5 per cent), Leflecting the recovery in the economy and

improved business confidence. From this expansion, about2l per cent came through foreign currency deposits. Thegrowth in deposits, achieved even under a relatively low

interest rate regime and continued tiscal measures such as thedebit tax on demand deposits and a withholding tax on

interest income on deposits, is partly a reflection of the lack

of alternative investment avenues, due to the under developed

nilture of the domestic capital market.

Credit to the private sector fl'om commercial banks gl'ew

at a higher rate during the second half of the year, reaching an

overall glowth slightly higher than anticipated in the originalmonetary programme. The high growth in credit was areflection of increased credit demand for commercial,

consumption and investment purposes. Mennwhile, the ratioof gross non-performing loans to total loans and advances of

commercial banks (DBUs and FCBUs), declined to 12.6 per

cent in 2003 from 14.2 per cent in 2002, while net NPLs

declined to 4.1 per cent fiom 6.3 at the beginning of the year.

The credit to deposit ratio of the DBUs of commer.cial banksdeclined marginally as deposits grew at a slightly higher rateof 13.4 per cent, in comparison to the growth in totaladvances of I 1.4 per cent.

Structure of Assets and Liabilities ofCommercial Banks

Domestic Banking UnitsThe total l'esources of commercial banks improvedsubstantially by Rs.9l,0Z4 million (12,3 per cenr) in 2003compared to Rs.46,870 million (6.3 per cenr) in 2003. Somechange in the composition of the portfbrio of assets was seen,reflecting economic g'owth. on the assets side, about 50 percent of the growth came through an increase in total loans andadvances, in comparison, to about lZ per cent in 2002.Investments and fixed and other assets contribute d 42 percent and 17 per cent, respectively. Loans, overdrafts and

purchases of commercial bills, which are the components inthe total loans and advances, loans and overdrafts, grew by2l per cent and 7 per cent, respectively, while commercialbills declined by 42 per cenr in 2003. The decline incommercial bills entirely came through a decline in importbills purchased and discounted as both the local bills andexport bills increased. The decline in import bills courd beattributed to the availability of suppliers'credit fromimporters abroad at low interest rates in the inte'nationalmarket.The growth in investments of commercial banksdecelerated in 2003 to 40 per cent compared to 69 per cent in2002. This could be attributed to both an incLease in demandfor credit by the private sector and a containment of theabsorption of funds by the government.Liquid assets of commercial banks expanded further in2003 (12.0 pel cent), though at a slower pace than in 2002(17,8 per cent).

cash on hand of DBUs expanded at a slower rate in 2003

while dues trom the central Bank, foreign currency on hand

and commercial bills declined over the previous year. The

ratio of total liquid assets to total assets remained at 31 per

cent, as in2002. The excess liquidity in the market at end

2003 was around Rs. t0 billion compared with about Rs.1l

billion at end 2002.On the liabilities side, deposit liabilities grew by

13.6 per cent in 2003 in comparison to a 10.5 per cent growth

in 2002. Both demand deposits and time and savings deposits

increased during the year. Demand deposits increased by l7

per cent, in contrast to the 4-7 per cent decline in 2002, while

time and savings deposits grew by l3 per cent in comparison

to 13.4 per cent growth in 2003. As total borrowings of the

commercial banks declined particularly due to the decline in

local borrowings during the yeat, the growth rn total

liabilities was less than the growth in deposit liabilities.

Deposit liabilities as a ratio of total liabilities increased

marginally to 74 per cent from 73 per cent in 2002'

Reflecting excess liquidity in the banks, the decliningtlend in inter'-bank borrowings continued, although the

decline was less in 2003, Also, the exposure of commercial

banks to external financing increased marginally as some

commercial banks borrowed from banks abroad'An improvement in the capital accounts of banks by

Rs.23 billion (45 per cent) in 2003 has been recorded in

comparison to a Rs.7 billion increase in 2002' Two major

reasons tor this were the increase in profits of banks and the

issue of debentures by some commercial banks to raise

capital to meet the increased CAR.With the continued ceasefire and the growth in

economic activity, business confidence improved throughout

much of the year with a positive impact on foreign currency

inflows to the country. Foreign culrency inflows to the

banking system grew substantially with increases in inflows

through private r-emittances, fourism, the stock market and

foreign currency deposits. DBUs placed a part of their

foreign cun'ency resources with FCBUs for their operations,

while about US dollars 377 million were sold to the Central

Bank. From the perspective of DBUs, the net outcome was a

decline in NFA of DBUs by about Rs.19 billion. However,NFA of the consolidated banking system (including both

DBUs and FcBUs) increased by about Rs.9 billion in 2003,

partly because half the non-resident foreign currency deposits(NRFCs) are regarded as being effectively domesticliabilities, rather than foreign liabilities, for computing

overall NFA,About 95 per cent of the foreign liabilities of DBUs

arose ftom fbLeign currency deposits in the NRFC, RNNFC,

RFC accounts and Foreign Currency Accounts of Exporters.

Balances in foreign currency accounts grew by 13 per cent in

2003 compared to 15 Per cent in 2002.

Foreign CurrencY Banking Units

Total assers i liabilities of FCBUs increased by US dollars 2l

million (l per cent) to US dollars 1,795 million in 2003, in

contrast to the US dollars 129 million (7 per cent) decline in

2002. About 34 per cent of the resources of FCBUs in 2003

came from DBU placements of toreign currency deposits

(uS dollars 620 million) and deposits by BOI enterprises

(US dollars 458 million). Placements of DBU funds with

FCBUs declined marginally, while deposits of BOI

enterprises increased substantialty by about 33 per cent in

2003. Resources from non-national Sources accounted for

around l5 per cent of total resoulces (US dollars 276 million)

in 2003, in comparison to l9 per cent of total resources

(US dollars 330 million) in 2002'

Loans and advances to BOI enterprises, credit to the

government and public cofporations and investment in

non-resident enterplises were the main areas where FCBU

funds were utilised. Reflecting the recovery in foreign trade,

cLedit extended to the BOI enterprises increased from

uS dollars 770 million to US dollars 870 million. As the

government settled maturing Sri Lanka Development Bonds,

which were partly held by FcBUs, the utilisation of FCBUs

resources by the government declined from US dollars 416million in 2002 to US dollars 343 million in 2003'

Meanwhile, credit extended to public corporations declined

by US dollars 80 million as the CPC settled a part of its loans

outstanding during the Year.

Sources and Uses of Funds of Domestic Units of

Commercial Banks

In the flnancial system of the country, commercial banks play

a major role in mobilising funds from surplus units and

pLoviding funds to deficit units. The government, public

corporations and the general public, as well as foreign

entities, transact with commercial banks. Depending on the

circumstances, these units could be sources of funds or users

of funds of commercial banks. The net availability of funds to

the commercial banks is a result of the aggregation of the

changes in assets and liabilities of commercial banks with

these units.Total assets and liabilities of commercial banks

increased substantially in 2003 resulting in a significant

growth in resources and their utilisation on a gross basis.

However, the net sources / uses of resources was lower in

2003 than in 2002 reflecting low inter-sectoral dependence of

funds. The total net sources / uses of funds at the end of 2003

was Rs.29,l l0 million in comparison to Rs.26,787 million at

end 2002. on net basis, the foreign sector, the central Bank,

capital and reserves and the domestic plivate sector were the

sources of funds of commercial banks while on a net basismajor users of funds were the government, public

corporations and other banks.In 2003, as in 2002, the largest source of funds of DBUs'

on a net basis, was the fbreign sector, retlecting an expansion

in foreign currency deposits and borrowings from foreign

sources. The contribution of the growth in foLeign currency

resources to the total net Sources of funds of banks was about

234Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2003

Part IChapter 10 - FINANCIAL SECTOR

TABLE 10.8Sources and Uses of Resources ofCommercial Banks (a)

67 pet cent in 2003, in comparis on to 42 per cent in 2002. Thecentral Bank was the second largest source of funds mainlydue to the decline in reserves of comme'cial banks with theCentral Bank towards the end of the year. However, onaverage, reserves were higher during the year in compar.isonto2002 as the deposit base of the commercralbanks increasedin 2003. The other assets and other liabilities category alsocontLibuted to the .sources of funds of commercial banks,particularly due to increases in capital and reserves ofcommercial banks, reflecting increase in the pr.ofits of mostbanks and debenture issues by some commercial banks. Thenet contribution of the private sector as a source of funds waslow, although gross values were high, as the gr-owth inutilisation of banking resources by the plivate sector (sourceof funds) was almost similar to the growth in deposits in2003.On a net basis, the government was the major user offunds of commercial banks though at a Iower level, ascommercial banks invested part of their resources ingovernment securities, Secondly, government corporationswere uset's of funds of the DBUs on a net basis, as deposits ofcorporations declined over the previous year by a largeramounI than the increase in bor-rowings. Meanwhile, thedependence of commercial banks fbr funds in the inter'-bankmoney malket was lower in 2003 than in 2002.

Commercial Banks' Loans and Advances2

Chapter 10 - FINANCIAL SECTORPart I

2003.Imports have improved by 10.2 per cent in rupee terms

during the first nine-month of the year, while credit provided

fbr impoLts improved by around 8 per cent. A comparatively

lower growth in credit extended for imports could have been

partly due to suppliers' credit given by ovet'seas buyers since

intetnational intelest rates too rvere low.The consumptton and housing and property

development categories, which accounted for 14-15 per cent

each in total credit, grew by 36 per cent and 13 per cent,

respectively. An increased demand for personal housing,

consumer durables and some recovery in real estate activitieswith the picking up of economic growth and downward

movement in interest rates, led to the increase in demand for

credit in these sectors. In the consumption category, c|edtt

given through credit cards has also shown an expanslon'

retlecting the growing use of cledit cards. The total numberof cards issued increased by 23 per cent, while the total

outstanding balances which amounted Rs,6.4 billion as at end

2002 increased to Rs.8.l billion in 2003'

The growth in credit outstanding in the industrial sector

increased by around l2 per cent at end September 2003, in

comparison to an i I per cent growth recorded ln the

l2-months ending September 2002. A growth in credit to

processed tea, rubber, coconut and other agricultural expotts

and an improvement in credit to other manufactut'ing erports

such as textiles, and leather products were seen' This is

consistent with the expansion of industrial activity recorded

in 2003.On a point to point basis, glowth in credit to the services

sector grew by 2 per cent, a lower rate than the credit glowth

in September 2002. However, if the two main sectors that

r-ecorded higher growth, namely tout'ism and financial

services (which are, in fact, classified undel the services

sector when compiling the national accounts), were included,

the growth in credit to services wouldbe l8 per cent as at end

September 2003, The credit provided to the toutism sector

increased by 20 per cent during the period under t'eview,

reilecting a high gfowth momentum in the sector. Growth in

cledit to the financial sector increased by 61 pel cent at end

September,2003 mainly due to an inctease in credit given to

financial institutions fbr the plovision of equity finance and

fundrng for leasing companies, llong with an increase in theactivities in these subsectors with the recovery in the

economy. An increase in credit fbr equity finance may also be

attr-ibuted to the inrprovements in stock market activities,

including margin trading. Credit provided for leasing has also

shown an improvement along with an improvement in lease

finance activities in the areas of passenger transport and

goods transport.Credit extended to the agricultural sector also increased

by 20 per cent during the I2 months ending September 2003

particularly due to the credit extended to the tea, coconut irnd

minor export crops. The overall improvement in credit to the

agricultural sector letlected the increase in aglicultural sector

activities, supported by the good welther conditions that

prevailed in the country during the first three quarters of

2003.Credit pLovided for pawning by commercial banks

increased substantially duLing the period undet' review. The

total credit provided tor pawning by major commercial banks

has increased by around Rs.14 billion during the 12-months

ending 2003, which was around I I per cent of the total credit

outstanding of these maJor commercial banks. Accordingly,

the growth in credit to pawnlng activities grew by 58 percent

in 2003 as against the 38 per cent -qrowth recorded in2002'Meanwhile, the interest rates chat'ged on pawning by

commercial banks have declined considernbly from a rangeof 19.00-27.00 per cent in December' 2002 to a range of

guarantees and fixed savings. The Average WeightedLending Rate (AWLR) declined fiom 19.6 per cent at endSeptember 2002 to 18.2 per cenr at end December 2002 andfurther to 16.4 per cent at end September 2003, reflectingsome reduction in general lending rates during the period.Although the decline in the AWLR was much slower than thedecline in other market rates, the AWLR declined by a higheramount in 2003 than in 2002. The AWLR, which declined byI'l per cent in 2002, declined further by r.g per cent duringthe three quarters in 2003. Lending rates discussed in thesection on interest rates (secrion 10.5) decreased in the fburthqualter of 2003.The amount of credit provided at higher rates of interestby comme'cial banks recorded a decline. As shown in Table10.10, there has been a slow and gradual reduction in lendinsrates from 2001 to September 2003.

10.7 Central Banking

The operations of the central Bank in 2003 were mainlyfocussed on the management of liquidity in the market at anappropriate level to achieve the monetary policy objective ofeconomic and price stability. The system of more active openmarket operations as the main instrument of monetarymanagement helped ro manage market liquidity eff'ectivelyby using the central Bank's policy interest rates. There was asubstantial improvement in foreign inflows to the centralBank in 2003, and it resulted in a change in the compositionof the balance sheet with a larger increase in foreign assetsand a conesponding decline in domestic assets of the cenh'alBank.A substantial increase in fbreign currency inflows to thecountry was recorded in 2003 as indicated in theimprovement in the BoP. As the government sold its foreigncumency receipts fiom foreign loans to the central Bank, andalso a substantial amount of foreign exchange was pur.chasedby the Central Bank from the commercial banks, rupeeliquidity in the market increased. This excess liquidity wasabsorbed through the open market operations of the centralBank and consequently, holdings of government papershifted fiom the central Bank to commercial banks, As thecentral Bank holdings of rreasury bills declined from aroundRs.55 billion at the beginning of 2003 ro about Rs.16 billionby the third quarter, the central Bank issued Rs.5 billronworth of its own securities in September to mop up the excessliquidity in the market. These were issued for a period of lessthan three months and had been settled by the end of the year.Structure of Assets and Liabilities of theCentral Bank

The value of total assets and liabilities of the central Bankincreased by 17 per cent during 2003. on the assets side, theincrease was entirely in fbreign assets reflecting the increasein foreign reserves of the central Bank which more thanoffset the decline in domestic assets. The increase in foreisn

assets mainly came through funds received under the pRGFfacility of the IMF, sales of tbreign exchange receipts of thegovernment to the Central Bank and purchases of foreignexchange by the Central Bank trom the commercial banks.Total net foreign assets of the Central Bank increased by40 per cent (Rs.47 billion). In comparison, fhe improvementin net foreign assets in2002 was 39 per cent (Rs.33 billion).In contrast, net domestic assets of the Central Bankdeclined by Rs.32 billion, particularly due to the decline innet holdings of government securities by Rs.28 billion toRs,ll.5 billion at end December 2003. provisional advancesto the government which are provided through the r.evolvingcredit facility, increased only marginally in 2003.On the Iiabilities side, the total cumency issue of theBank increased by Rs.l0 billion (11.9 per cent): the issue ofcurency notes increased by 12 per cent and coins by 7 percent. Deposit liabilities of the Central Bank increased by2I per cent particularly due to deposits of internationalorganisations which include the drawings from the IMF.Deposits of commelcial banks increased (I2per cent), whichwas due to an increase in the statutory reserve requirement(SRR) on increased commercial banks deposit liabilities.

10.8 Banking Development

The total number of Licensed Commer-cial Banks (LCBs),operating in the country decreased to 22 (l I domestic banksand I I branches of fbreign banks) at end 2003 fiom 23 at end2002, as a result of the absorption of the operation ofstandard chartered Grindlays Bank by standard chalteredBank. Meanwhile, the total number of iicensed specialisedbanks (LSBs) rose to 14 at end 2003 trom l3 at end 2002 withthe registration of Housing Development FinanceCorporation (HDFC) as a LSB. In addition, one LSB,Pramuka Savings and Development Bank, was underresolution by the Central Bank in terms of statutes.

Branch Expansion

The local branch network of comme'cial banks increasedfrom 1,163 at end2002 to l,l9l at end 2003. The increasewas mainly in domestic banks which opened 26 branchesduring the year. Foreign bank branches increased from 35 atend 2002 to 37 at end 2003. Continuing the trend seen in2001, the banking density, i.e., the number of commercialbank branches per 10,000 people recorded a marginalincrease from 0.6 | in 2002 ro 0.69 in 2003. The branchnetwork of LSBs increased by 4I to 370 ar end 2003, mainlyas result of HDFC which has a branch network of 20, beingregistered as a LSB. Of the total number of LSB branches,around 83 per cent were accounted fbr by NSB and RDBs.

The Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka (CRIB) wasestablished under the Credit Information Bureau of Sri LankaAct, No. l8 of 1990 (later amended by Act No. 8 of 1995),with the objective of collecting and collating information onborrowers and to furnish such information to shareholdinglending institutions. At present, 82 institutions, including alllicensed commercial banks, licensed specialised banks,registered finance companies, registered leasingestablishments, and the Central Bank, are shareholders ofCRIB.CRIB currently collects infbrmation on regular advancesof Rs.500,000 and over, and irregular advances of Rs.100,000and over, The number of credit reports issued during the yearincreased to 389,171 from285,269 in2002, reflecting higherdemand for credit with the recovery in economic activity andalso demonstrating that credit information is used as animportant risk management tool by lending institutions. Thisincreased demand for credit information contributed to asharp increase in the Bureau's profits, to Rs.32.9 million in2003, from Rs.24.5 million in2002.The number of advances recorded in the databaseamounted to 159,500 in 2003, compared with 139,500 in2002. Of the number of advances in 2003, 106,000 advanceswere regular, while 53,500 were irregular advances (advanceswhich are more than six months in default). The value ofirregular advances in the database was about Rs.l03 billioncompared with about Rs.99 billion in 2002. Of the rotalirregular advances, 74 per cent were accounted for by thecorporate sector, while the balance was accounted for byindividual borrowers. More than 90 per cent of these inegularadvances were advances over one million ruDees.

10.10 Rural Banking and Credit

Overall Trends and Developments

Several measures were taken during 2003 to strengthenmicrofinance activities and the microfinance sector of thecountry. Banks and other financial institutions furtherexpanded their credit programmes to the North and the Eastwith the peaceful environment that prevailed in those areas.Cultivation loans granted under the New ComprehensiveRural Credit Scheme (NCRCS) picked up substantially in

these areas particularly, in the districts of Ampara, Batticaloaand Trincomalee, Following the declining trends in theinterest rates, the on Iending interest rate on loans granted

under NCRCS was reduced from 12 per cent to 8 per cent perannum, while the interest subsidy paid by the government tolending banks on these loans lvas also reduced from l0 percent to 8 per cent. The Forward Sales Contract System(FSCS) introduced in 1999 was further expanded in 2003.The pilot project introduced tn2002 by the Central Bank withfunding assistance from the World Bank to promote the FSCSwas successfully completed in 2003 and steps were taken to

explore the possibility of establishing a futures market for

agricul tural commodities.A major development in the policy area was the signingof a project agreement between the Asian Development Bank(ADB) and the Government of Sri Lanka tor the developmentand strengthening of the rural finance sector in the country.The Rural Finance Sector Development Project (RFSDP) isdesigned to contribute to promoting economic growth andpoverty reduction. The objective of the project is tostrengthen key sector institutions for the provision of trainingin rural finance services, efficient service delivery by ruralfinance institutions (RFIs), rural finance sector supervisionand outreach expansion. The project will support therestructuring plans of Cooperative Rural Banks (CRBs) andRegional Development Banks (RDBs), the NationalDevelopment Fund's (NDTF) Corporate Plan and theSamurdhi Institutional Strengthening Plan. These reformsemphasise good governance of RFIs, efficient delivery ofrural finance services and increased demand for suchservices. A legal and regulatory framework will beintroduced fbr the regulation and supervision of RFIs, which

do not come under central Bank supervision, The retormswill also support the establishment of a Rural EconomicResuscitation Trust Fund fbr expanded skills, technical andmarketing support to enable the rural poor to use access toru'al finance services efficientry. with a view to buildingrural finance sector capacity, the project will support thestrengthening of the cent'e for Banking Studies of thecentral Bank of sri Lanka as a centre of excellence in ruralfinance training.The two microfinance programmes implemented by thecentral Bank, namely, the small Farmers and the Landresscredit Project (sFLCp - ISURU) and the poverry AlleviationMic'ofinance Project (pAMp) continued their operations inthe project districts in 2003. The projects use a self-helpapproach in developing necessary social capital at theg'assroots level for alleviating poverty through incomegeneration. The SFLCP was in operation in the districts ofMatara, Galle, Kandy and puttalam, while the pAMp was inopelation in the districts of Badulla, Hambantota, Kalutar.a,Ku'unegala, Matale and Nuwa'a Eliya. Initratives were takento expand the PAMP to the dist'icts in the North and Eastthrough commercial banks, namely, Bank of Ceylon, HattonNational Bank and Seylan Bank, which will be theimplementing agencies. With a view to ensuring the long_term sustainability of the project, the distLict level ISURUDevelopment Societies (IDSs) of the sFLCp districts wer.eregrstered as peoples companies and they were amalgamatedinto a national level ISURU Fecleration.As an initial step in RDB refbLms, a part of the shares ofRDBs held by the centrar Bank were transferred to theMinistry of Finance and as a resurt, the central Bank holdineof RDB shares was reduced to 20 per cent in each RDB.

Forward Sales Contract System(Govi Sahanaya)

As a market based solution to the problems of farmers inmarketing their agricultural produce, the Forward Salescontract (FSC) system was initiated in 1999 by the CentralBank. Under the Forward Saies Contract System, theproducers and the buyers are encouraged to enter intocontracts with an agreed price at the time of cultivation oftheir crops. The FSC system will ensure a fair price fbr thefarmers' ploduce, minimising the impact of rapid fluctuationsin prices realised by the farmers.This plogramme was supported by the World Bank byproviding necessary funds under its Development MarketPlace Pro;ect and it was implemented from April ,2002 toJune, 2003. The central Bank implemented the project withthe participation of Bank of Ceylon, people's Bank, SeylanBank, Comme'cial Bank, six RDBs and Sarvodaya SEEDS asfacilitators of the contracts. This pilot project, aimed atpiomoting sales contract systems among farmers, buyers,bankers, policy makers and the general public, wassuccessfully completed in 2003, Under- the project,2,3g4awafeness programmes were held in all major agriculturalareas of the country with the participation of t21,000persons, In addition to the meetings and workshops, booklets,posters and documentaries were prepared in sinhala, Tamiland English to propagate the concept of the Forward SalesContract System.Undet the project, in addition to awareness/publicityprogrammes, the particrpatin-q institutions were plovided withmotorcycles and computers for promotion of the system inthe respective areas. The progress of the FSC System issummarised in Tabel 10.16.

conditions that prevailed in agricultur-al areas during the year,the substantial increase of cultivation loans granted in theEastern Province and the leduction of the interest rate oncultivation loans from l2 per cent to 8 per cent per annumwith effect from Yala 2003 were the main factors tharcontributed to the increase. A similar trend could be observedin respect of loans granted for purchase of agriculturalproduce directly from the farmers under the FSC System ofthe NCRCS. The loans granted for purchase of paddy, maize,soya, green gram and finger millet (kurakkan) showedsubstantial increases. In Maha 200212003, the loans grantedunder FSCS for purchase of paddy and other agriculturalcrops amounted to Rs.292 million and in yala 2003 to Rs.466million, compared to Rs.77 million and Rs.279 milliongranted during the conesponding seasons in the previouscultivation year, The government paid Rs.66 million tolending banks as interest subsidy in respect of loans grantedunder NCRCS in 2003. A sum of Rs.78 million was paidunder the scheme to lending banks as credit guaranteeindemnity against the cultivation loans defaulted durins 1994- 1998.

Crop Insurance Schemes

The Agricultural and Agrarian Insurance Board (AAIB)continued to provide insurance cover for l4 selected crops,livestock and post-harvest activities. Ceylinco InsuranceCompany Limited (CICL) also provided insurance cover forthe same crops and livestock under their scheme. In 2003, theAAIB added two more crops, namely, banana and gingerunder its crop insurance scheme. CICL implemented specialinsurance schemes, namely, the Post Harvest Crop InsuranceScheme for paddy and the Ceylinco Seylan GoviRakawaranaya, which offered special life and healthinsurance cover tor crop credit customels.The extent of paddy land insur-ed by the AAIB and CICLin 2003, amounted to 8,400 hectares and 25,293 hectares,respectively. The area covered by the AAIB has mor-e thandoubled, while the area insured by CICL increased by 5,601hectares when compared to the area covered,in2002. The

indemnities paid by AAIB and CICL to affected policyholders amounted to Rs.0.8 million and Rs.2.9 mrllionrespectively.

Microfinance Schemes

Various microfinance institutions, as given in the table belowcontinued to provide microfinance services that includedsavings, credit and other financial services to assist the poorand low-income persons fbr their economic empowerment.Many institutions adopted the self-help groups approach inreaching the poor effectively and minimising the cost ofproviding such financial services, Social mobilisation oftarget groups occupied high priority in their microfinancingapproaches, The organisation of microflnance clients intovillage level, district level and national level networksstrengthened their capacity in obtaining financial services andintegration with wider markets for their products. The twomicrofinance schemes implemented by the Central Bank ofSri Lanka, namely the SFLCP and the PAMP, showedconsiderable progress in the project distilcts during 2003. Thefirst national convention of the national level ISURUFederation was held in 2003. A major objective of theConvention, and the trade fair that followed the convention,was to bring the scattered small producers into a marketingnetwork among the member societies and to link them withestablished buyers in the formal sector, while strengtheningthe institutional structure of the project to ensure long-termsustainability of the project,

National Development Trust Fund (NDTF)

The National Development Trust Fund (NDTF), formerlyknown as the Janasaviya Trust Fund, is a non-profitorganisation established in l99l under the Trust Ordinance.Its main function is to implement a programme of micro-credit for the poor segments of the society with a view toalleviating poverty in the country. One of the major strengthsof the NDTF has been its ability to use NGOs as conduits togrant loans to the poor without collateral,

Poverty focussed microfinance programmes which arefacilitated by the NDTF have adopted a participatoryapproach to achieve the objective of poverty reduction by. forming small groups, increasing awareness andmobilising and transforming them into aneconomically active segment of the community;. encouraging sustainable economic activities whichwill improve the standard of living; and. building capacity of community-based volunteerorganrsatrons.

At present, more than 400,000 poor individuals have

been covered under the programmes of the NDTF. The NDTFoperates through a network of some 209 PartnerOrganisations comprising non-governmental organisations(NGOs), RDBs, co-operative societies and commercial andspecialised banks spread throughout the country. The NDTFis managed by a Board of Trustees representing thegovernment and non-governmental organisations coveringmicro-credit, gender, nutrition, academic research and humanresources.The NDTF extends assistance to its registered PartnerOlganisations to undertake skills development programmesamong the poor with a view to developing theircreditworthiness in the long run. The NDTF will be able toprovide more funds for micro credit and capacity building ofPartner Organisations with the assistance of the funds madeavailable through donor agencies under two new projects tobe implemented in 2004, namely, the Rural Finance SectorDevelopment Project (RFSDP) and the Aquatic ResourcesDevelopment Ploject.Under the RFSDP, the NDTF is responsible forco-ordinating and monitoring the credit delivery system andadministrative functions associated with refinanceapplications and loan disbursement requests by the PFIs. Theproject will assist NDTF with capacity building, includingprovision of training to the Partner Organisations and willfacilitate vulnerable communities access to micro creditthrough group formation and community organisation. Inparticular, vulnerable communities will be assisted byimplementing partner NGOs in identifying viable livelihoodactivities in fisher ies, aquaculture, agricul ture, agro-forestry,eco-tourism and a range of micro enterprise developmentopportunities based on nontraditional activities. Businessadvisory and technical support services in relation tolivelihood and micro-enterprise development will also beprovided to potential borrowers.

Regional Development Banks (RDBs)

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka was initially the mainshareholder of the six RDBs with over 50 per cent of the rotal

issued share capital of each RDB. However, the Central Banksubsequently reduced its shareholding of each RDB to 20 per'cent by transferring the balance to the government.

The subject of RDBs, which was under the Ministry ofFinance, was brought under the Ministly of Rural Economywith effect from 28 February 2003. The Ministry of RuralEconomy introduced several credit schemes such as'Athamaru', 'Diriyalanda' and 'Gemira' to be implementedthrough RDBs in order to diversify the microfinance servicesoffered by them. The Ministry has also intLoduced theProduction Specialised Villages Programme with a view toenhancing the productive capacity of people in selectedvillages that specialise in a particular product by using theresources available in those villages. The cost of theeconomic infrastructure development of these villages, asidentified under the programme, is to be borne by the RuralEconomic Resuscitation Trust Fund of the Ministry, while theRDBs are expected to provide necessary microfinanceservices in those villages.A large segment of Iower and middle income groups livein semi-urban and rural areas in the Colombo District, whichdo not enjoy the facilities provided by the RDBs. In addition,a considelable number of the urban poor and lower-middleincome earners living in urban areas are in need of bankingfacilities for improvement of their economic activities. Withthe objective of expanding bankin_e tacilities to these people,the administrative district of Colombo was included in theregion of the Sabar-agamuwa Development Bank (SDB) witheffect from l5 September 2003, increasing the total numberof districts served by the RDBs to eighteen. The first branchin the Colombo District was opened in Homagama inDecember 2003.

10.11 Other Financial Institutions

Savings Institutions

The National Savings Bank (NSB) continued to of'fer newproducts and expand its distribution network during the year,in its endeavoul to maintain a competitive edge in theindustry, The bank became the first Sri Lankan bank to beawarded SL AAA credit rating by a local credit ratingagency. It introduced a new deposit product titled 'Gaurawa'for the benetlt of persons over 60 years of age to provide acushion to their purchasing power. The bank launched a newlending scheme, 'Alankara Home Loan', to provide loans forthe modernisation of houses. Another service introduced bythe bank was the provision of a life insurance cover with aceiling of Rs.300,000, for all savings account holdersbetween l8 and 70 years of age, who maintain an averagebalance of Rs.l0, 000 in their account for three monthsimmediately prior to death.The bank has obtained the services of a consultingagency for the purpose of connecting all the branches andATMs under its three year IT strategy. At end 2003, the bankhad a network of ll2 branches, with 39 branches providingservices during the weekends and one branch providing a24-hour service.

The deposit base of the bank increased to Rs.l6l billionin 2003 fiom Rs.l35 billion tn2002, a growth rate of 19.2 percent. The total loans outstanding too increased fi'om Rs.26billion at end 2002 to Rs. 3l billion at end 2003, with loansover 5 years accounting for about 36 per cent of the totaloutstanding loans. Total loans disbursed during the yearamounted to Rs.23 billion, of which the major share wasaccounted for by loans to financial institutions and housing.In terms of size,91 per cent of loans disbursed during theyear f-ell into the category of loans above Rs,500,000. Therate of interest charged by the bank on its loans rangedbetween 5-20 per cent. The majority of loans ( 86 per cent)have been granted at rates between 8 - 12 per- cent. Thebank's investments were mainly in government securities (88per cent) in addition to other forms of investments such asdebentures, flxed deposits and commercial paper,

Contractual Savings Institutions

The major contractual savings institutions are the providentfunds, which are designed to provide members withsuperannuation benefits, other than insurance companies,There were four state controlled provident funds, yiz.,Employees Provident Fund (EPF), Employees' Trust Fund(ETF), Public Selvice Provident Fund (PSPF) andContributoly Pension Fund (CPF) and around lg0 otherapproved private provident funds operating at end 2003, withthe EPF accounting for the major share of resources. In 2002,the government intloduced a contlibutory pension fund fornew entrants to the public service with a view to creating asustainable pension scheme for employees who join thePublic Service, Local Government Selvice and ProvincialPublic Service on or after 01 January 2003. In 2003,legislatton was amended to provide provident fund benefits topersons holding non pensionable posts in the governmentservice, to cover all employees who are paid other than on a

monthly basis. In addition, a bill was drafted fbr the creationof a Commission to register, regulate and supervisesuperannuation tundsThe total contribution to the EPF, the largest providentfund and the single lalgest investment fund in Sr-i Lanka,increased due to the combined effect of an increase in thecontributing membership during the year and incteased

salaries and wages. The total investments of the EPF gLew byl3.l per cent to Rs.320 billion ar end 2003 trom Rs.283billion at end 2002. The share of investments in governmentsecurities has increased from 97.5 per cent at end 2002 to98.3 per cent at end 2003, as a result of the maturing ofinvestments in corporate debt papers, lack of new cor-poratedebt issues, and diversification of investments into long termsassets (primarily Treasury bonds) in order to reduce maturitymismatches. A substantial increase in capital gains resultingfrom a booming share market and a declining interest ratelegime during the year enabled the EPF to lecord a rise in therealised annual average return on its investment portfblio to13.11 per cent in 2003 from 13.61 per cent in 2002. The totalnet assets of the EPF increased by 14.5 per cent trom Rs,296billion at end 2002 to Rs.339 billion ar end 2003.The ETF, which is an employer contributory fund, toorecorded an expansion. The total contributions to the ETFrose to Rs.3.7 billion in 2003 from Rs.3.5 billion in 2002,reflecting both an increase in the number of contributors anda general rise in wage levels during the year.

increased by about 9 per cent over the previous year, possibly

due to protit taking by sale of equity holdings towards the endof the year and the lack of long-term financial instrumentsother than Treasury bonds, which are suited for the liability

structure of the Fund.The coverage of the Public Service Provident Fund(PSPF), operated by the state, was extended to all

non-pensionable employees of the government, whether paid

monthly or otherwise. At end 2003, there were approximately

166,036 members with an estimated active membership baseof around 50,000, the majority of whom belong to the

Reserve Police Service. The number of new entrants to the

Fund during the year was 1,562. The total assets of the Fund

stood at Rs,9.3 billion at end 2003, from Rs.8.l billion at end2002. The total contributions received during the year,

consisting of Rs.l69 million from government and Rs.244million from members, amounted to Rs.4l3 million, while

the total refunds made during the same period stood at Rs.l44million.The private sector provident funds (PPF), numberingabout 190, had a membership base of around 143,000 as at

the year end. The total assets of the fund increased to Rs.85billion at end 2003 fiom Rs,80 billion at end 2003.

Reflecting the conducive environment for investmentfollowing the improved business confidence and reduction in

lending rates, the total loans approved by these institutions in

respect of agriculture, industry, tourism, housing, finance and

commerce sectors, grew by 55 per cent to Rs.50.4 billion at

end 2003 from Rs.32.4 billion. The two key institutions in

this category viz., DFCC Bank and NDB, contributed 73 percent of the increase in loans approved, The total loans

disbursed out of loans approved in both current and ptevious

years increased by 38 per cent from Rs.28 billion at end 2002

to Rs.39 billion at end 2003. Although all the major sectors

showed positive credit growth, the bulk of the inctease(88 per cent) in loans approved was accounted for by

industry, finance, housing and infiastructure sectors.The share of long-term loans in the total outstanding

loans recorded an increase from 30 per cent at end 2002 to

39 pel cent at end 2003, possibly as a result of borrowers'

attempts to lock into the lower long-term lending lates thatprevailed duling the year. In terms of the maturitydistribution, the shares of short-term (less than one year),medium term (between l-5 years) and long-term loans

(above 5 years) in the total loan portfolio at end 2003, werel9 per cent,42 per cent and 39 per cent, respectively.The two Development Finance Institutions (DFIs),

DFCC Bank and NDB, which grant a major share of loans for

large enterprises as well as the SMI sector, showed positivegrowth in both loans approved and loans disbursed with

almost a two-fold growth in loans approved. The weighted

average lending rates of DFIs decreased from a range ofl3-16 per cent in2002 to l2-13 per cent in 2003, in line withthe downward movement in general interest rates in the

country. The share of loans granted by the DFIs at interest

lates below 12 per cent was about 53 per cent of all loans in

2003 in comparison to 28 per cent in 2002.A major constraint faced by DFIs is the decline in the

concessional long-term financing trom multilateral agencies.In recognition of the diftjculties faced by DFIs, the original

single product development bank model is being changed byallowing DFIs to expand their product range throughdiversification and consolidation. This would plovide the

DFIs not only with adequate flexibility in securing sources of

funds for project lending but also diversity in income which

would enhance their risk management ability.The loans approved for the housing sector by allinstitutions during the year grew by about 27 per cent and

amounted to Rs.7.8 billion, while loans approved by the four

housing institutions increased by 25 per cent to Rs.4.8 billion.

The lending rates among the four housing institutions also

saw a downward adjustment during the year. The weightedaverage lending rates among these institutions ranged

between ll-15 per cent in 2003 as compared to l3-17 per

cent in 2002.

The phenomenaf growth in housing financing in :

, The major change that the secondary market brings tohousing financing is by the 'unbundling' of four majoraspects of housing finance: ion, funding,aCcepting various risks [such as credit (defauli)risk, interest r'ate risk, oper-ation liquidity risk],and servicing, While mor-tgage lenders deal wtthorigination and servicing, investors provide I'unding andshare risks. secondary market institutions absorb most ofthe risks. Unbundling, however, -Eives rise to a newproblem, the piincipal.agenl probiem, where an originatorcould be la,x in checking creditworthiness of a bonower,since he will pass on the cr-edit risk to the secondarvmarket players' Nevertheless, secondary maiket housin!financing institutions have been very profitable in the USas ',vell as in other countries.Sri I.anka has a conducive macroenvironment andwell-developed institutional inf'astructure to under-takethe function of granting Ioans for housing purposes.However, in view of the drffrculties those instltutions facein securing long-term funding, and the extent of economicactivities hindered by these difflculties, there is a clearneed for esqablishing institutions specialised insecuritisation, i.'e., special purpose vehicles (SpVs), Theirrole would be to make mortgage funds available toinstitutions in Sri Lanka Uy Oeu"elJping mor.tgage-backedsecurities and by selling them to the public, by linkingcapital markets to the morrgage marke[, and bringing thebenefits of the secondary mortgage market to develop thebond market in Sri Lanka.': The succe$s of ths5.

deposits, as well as the high risk profile of their borrowers,were some of the reasons cited by finance companies fbr theirinability to reduce lending rates further.The increase in the assets of finance companies wasmainly funded by deposit mobilisation, accounting fbr aroundtwo-thirds of the total sources of funds. Total deposits

mobilised by finance companies grew by l8 per cent in 2003

over the previous year. The decline in intelest on government

securities and commercial bank deposits continued to attractdeposits to tlnance companies, Capital funds grew by aloundl7 per cent and accounted for around l3 per cent of the

sources of funds. The most significant growth was in the areaof borrowings fiom commercial banks. Finance companieshave been seeking to diversify their funding sources and

reduce the mismatch between their lending and deposit bases.

Some companies have obtained medium-term loans flomcommercial banks by moltgaging their lease receivables.Although finance companies have the potential to engage insecuritisation of their leasing portfolio, there are

impediments, which are currently being addressed thrcugh aproposed amendment to the Finance Leasing Act. Debtsecurities would be another- source of funding for finance

companies in the future. One finance company has alreadyobtained a credit rating and, given the proposal in Budget

Finance companies

Finance companies continue to play an impoltant role asfinancial intermediaries, particularly to a segment of themarket which has difficulties in accessing funds from thecommercial banks. The activities of finance companies grewin 2003 as evidenced by the increase in their mobilisation of

deposits and in the provision of advances. In 2003, the total

assets of finance companies rose by 20 per cent (Rs.9 billion)

over the previous year. This growth was mainly in the areasof loans and advances and fixed assets. In the case of loansand advances, leasing operations accounted for aroundtwo-thilds of the entire loans and advances granted by tinancecompanies, glowing by 2I per cent (Rs.3.7 billion) in 2003.

Leasing facilities were mlinly provided to the passenger andgoods transportation sector. Although the real estate businessdid not see any significant growth in 2003, it was the secondlalgest sectol serviced by finance companies, The increase inhire purchase activity that took off in mid2002 with the taxadvantage afforded by the introduction of the VAT,

continued in 2003, recording a growth of 56 per cent (Rs.l.2billion). The lending rates of finance companies declined in2003, reflecting the fall in other market rates, although theycontinued to remain high.

They were also required tomaintain caprtal funds at a level not less than l0 per cent oftheir deposit liabilities. companies have been given two yearswithin which to comply with these directions.

10.12 Specialised Financial Institutions

Merchant Banking

The broad-based recovery in economic activity has benefitedthe merchant banking industry as ref-lected by the growth oftotal assets and profits during the year. The total assets grewby 4 per cent and stood at Rs.22 billion at enrd 2003 as againstRs.21 billion at end 2002.In line with the improvement in thetotal income fol the year by 54 per cent fiom Rs.2.0 billion in2002 to Rs.3.0 billion in 2003, the profitabiliry of the industryincreased to Rs.84 million in 2003 from a loss of Rs.723million. The reduction in losses in one fir.m and the increasein capital gains received from debt securities were the maincontributory factors for the improvement in the plofitabiliry.Interest income from loans and debt securities, capital gains,dividend income and income from leasing were the mainsources of income fbr the industry. The number of merchantbanks decreased to l r in 2003 following a company movingout of merchant bankine activities.

Leasing Companies

There were 56 finance leasing establishments registered withthe Central Bank at end 2003, consisting of commercialbanks, specialised banks, finance companies and otherspecialised leasing companies. A surge in reasing activitieswas recorded during the year as reflected in the growth inboth total assets and the leasing portfblio.The number of institutions engaged in Ieasing, excludingthe categories of banks, finance companies and merchantbanks, increased to ll in 2003 from l0 in 2002, The totalassets of these institutions grew by 43 per cent from Rs.l6.6billion in2002 to Rs.23.7 billion in 2003, whire the rotal leaseportfolio recorded a substantial growth of 49 per cent over thepervious year. Leasing facilities granted for commer-cial andpassenger vehicles continued to account for about 75 per centof total leases, though lecording a decrease over the previousyear. Sector-wise, trade, transportation and servicesaccounted for 73 per cent of leases granted, with the tradesector receiving the highest share of 33 per cent. The interestrates charged by individual firms in the industry decreasedfrom about 18 - 30 per cent in2002 to about 12 -30 per centin 2003, Bank borrowings. Iease securitisation, issue ofdebentures and commercial paper are the most tiequentlyused sources of financing of firms in the industry. With aview to diversify funding sources, Lanka Orix LeasingCompany (LOLC) took measures in 2003 to obtain a dollardenominated Ioan from a foreign source and issued a 'Bulland Bear commercial Paper' linked to a stock market index,The total leasing facilities provided by commercial banks,specialised banks, flnance companies and speciarised leasingtirms during the year amounted to about Rs.54 billion.Some of the constraints faced by the industry are thehigher cost of funds incurred by non-bank leasing firmsrelative to bank affiliated firms and legar impediments tosecuritisation of leases through assignment. Theunderdeveloped nature of corporate debt market and the nonavarlability of securitisation options due to legal constraintshas made non bank leasing firms heavily dependent oncommercial banks foL their funding. This has resulted in the

maturity mismatches in asset and liabilities of these firms and

higher cost of tunds for these institutions.

Venture Capital Companies

Funding by Venture Capital Companies, which are engagedin providing capital to high risk innovative projects has not

reversed its decline in 2003, despite fiscal incentives such as

a 5 year tax holiday for new firms and partial exemption fromincome tax, granted by the Budget for 2003. Both the total

equity participation and total assets of the industry recorded a

drop of about 13 and 38 per cent respectively, with hardly anynew projects being funded during the year, Some of the

factors that have been identified as hindering the industry are

the small average size of new projects, higher failure rates in

small and medium scale industry sector, difficulties for exit

and some sector specific factors. Even in IT related sectors,

there are a number of issues such as the firms' staying power- i.e., ability to get orders on a sustainable basis, size of the

domestic market, foreign competition and manpower, which

affects the success of projects.The total number of venture capital companies

decreased to six as a result of one firm moving out of theventure capital industry. The total asset base of the venturecapital ftrms declined to Rs.1,490 million at end 2003 from

Rs.2,395 million at end 2002, while the equity participationin projects too declined from Rs.1,081 million to Rs.940million during the same period, The total number of projects

financed dropped to 699 at end 2003 from 705 at end2002.

Insurance Companies

Two new firms, Life Insurance Corporation (Lanka) Ltd., andAll Lanka Mutual Organisation Ltd., entered the insuranceindustry duling the year, bringing the total number of firms in

the industry to 13 at end 2003 from l1 at end 2002. Of thel3 companies, two are engaged in life insurance and the othercompanies are engaged in both life as well as general

insurance. A significant event during the period under reviewwas the divestiture of a 90 per cent stake in the Sri Lanka

Insurance Corporation Ltd., (SLIC) by the government inApril 2003 for a sum of Rs.6,050 million to a consortium led

by Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka Ltd. and Aitken Spence& Co. Ltd. ING Inc, an insurance company with a global

presence, is the technical partner for both life and non-lifeinsurance activity, in addition to providing management

support. With the privatisation of SLIC, the government hasalmost entirely moved out of direct involvement in the

insurance industry. The government had owned close to 68per cent of the total assets of the insurance industry prior to

the divestment of SLIC in 2003.The performance of the insurance industry improved in

terms of asset growth, total premium collected, new policieswritten, branch expansion etc, The total asset base of theindustry grew by l0 per cent from Rs.55 billion at end 2002to Rs.6l billion at end 2003, with two firms accountin.q for

about 81 per cent of the total assets. The branch network

increased from 462 in 2002 to 480 in 2003. Although many

companies recorded an increase in profits over the previous

year, the industry profit for the year was affected negativelyby a lower level of protits in the dominant company.A positive growth perfbrmance was evident in all classesof insurance, i.e.,life, motor, accident, marine and fire. The

total value of life assurance funds stood at Rs.42.7 billton, aglowth of 20 per cent over the previous year. Meanwhile, the

total premia collected and sums insured in respect of neiv lifebusiness grew by 26 per cent The total number of newpolicies amounted to 269,000. The total benefit payments

under endowment, death and disability, surrender and other,

increased by 52 per ceni to Rs.3.6 billion in 2003. The net

premia for policies in force in the general insurance category,which cover all categories of insurance excluding life,

increased by 29 per cent in 2003. Of all non life insurance sub

sectors, the general and motor insurance sectors account for

about 90 per cent of the total premium collected.The average life insurance penetration (premium as a

percentage of gross domestic product) increased from 0.5 per

cent in 2002 to 0.6 per cent in 2003, while the total averageinsurance penetration too showed a similar trend by

increasing fiom 1.3 per cent to 1.4 per cent during the sameperiod. Insurance penetration is low in Sri Lanka, indicatingthe potential for expansion in the industry. The average life

and total insurance penetration respectively are 2.2 per cent

and 3.6 per cent for emerging countries and 5.4 per cent and8,4 per cent for industrialised countries. Meanwhile, the

insurance density (per capita premium ) increased to Rs,1,240(12.1 US dollars) during the year from Rs.1,050(10.9 US dollars) in2002.The strategy being adopted by some new companies ofmarketing small value policies at a lower premium wouldfacilitate the spread of the concept of long-term insurance at

the grass roots level, by making insurance atfordable to them

and hence improve the level of insurance penetration in the

country.

10.13 Financial Markets

Money and Foreign Exchange Markets

Money and foreign exchange markets remained liquidthrough most of 2003. The Central Bank's purchase offoreign exchange to build up its ottrcial reserves increasedrupee liquidity. In order to maintain reserve money at the

targeted level, the excess liquidity was continuously absorbedthrough the OMO of the Central Bank. Due to the excessliquidity in the system and a better distribution among banks,trading volumes in the call market declined. Interest rates atthe short end of the money market followed the changes in

the Central Bank's policy rates, declining gradually throughthe year and remaining close to the lower bound of theinterest rate corridor (i.e., the Repo rate) formed by the

Central Bank's two policy rates.

250Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2003

Part IChapter 10 - FtNANCIAL SECTOR

In the government securities market, the lower domesticborrowing requirement of the government and the excessliquidity in the system saw the primary auctions beingheavily oversubscribed. This, together with the r-eduction inpolicy rates and decline in inflation expectation, shifted downthe government securities yield curve.The inflow of fbreign exchange through remittances,higher earnings fiom tourism and port activity and the lowertrade deficit, as well as higher capital inflows, kept thefo'eign exchange market 'elatively liquid, increasing tradingactivity and stabilising the rupee vis-d-vis the uS dollar.Although the money market and the foreign exchange marketremained relatively liquid and stable throughout 2003, a briefperiod of volatility was witnessed towards the end of the yearreflecting negative market sentrments caused by politicalevents.A significant milestone in the reform of the paymentssystem was the introduction of a Rear Time Gross settlement(RTGS) system by the centrar Bank. The RTGS sysrem willfacilitate lalge value fund transf'ers and settlement in real timerather than at the end of the day as was done previously. It isexpected to boost activity in the money market. This is animportant development in the payments system as it reducessettlement risk and enhances the stability and reliability of thepayments system. The central Bank has also taken steps tointroduce a scripless securities and Settlement (sSS) systemin early 2004- This is also expected to encourage activity inthe money market and the secondary market for governmentsecurities.

Inter Bank Call Money Market

The money market continued to remain liquid during 2003.The excess liquidity in the system reduced the volumes tr-aded

in the inter bank market. The average daily votumes in thecall market in 2003 decreased by around 27 per cent toRs.936 million, from a year ago, The call market ratecontinued to fall, in line with the reductions in the centralBank's policy rates, declining from 10.39 per cent at endDecember,2002 to 7.59 per cent at end December ,2003.Intloduction of a more active open market operations systemin March 2003 encouraged banks to manage their liquiditymore effectively and helped to reduce the volatility in the callmoney market,

Primary Treasury Bitt Market

The lower borrowing requirement of the govemment and theexcess liquidity in the market saw the primary auctions ofgovernment securities heavily oversubscribed. These factors,together with the gradual reduction in policy rates and lowerinflationary expectations, caused the yields on gover-nmentsecurities across all maturities to fall, until the latter part ofthe year, when yields began to rise marginally, as aconsequence of the uncertainty in the market. The decline inyields on Treasury bills was 325 basis points on 364_dayTreasury bills and 281 basis points on 9l,day Treasury bills.The total value of bills sold by the government in 2003amounted to Rs.342.8 billion, almost the same amount as rn2002. of these issues in 2003, Rs.313.4 biilion were reissues.while the rest (Rs.29.5 billion) were new issues. A portion ofthe new issues were used to settle the dollar denominated sriLanka Developments Bonds (sLDBs). The majority of billsissued were in the category of 364-day bills (42 per cent oftotal bills issued) and 9l-day bills (36 per cent of total billsissued). The central Bank's purchases of rreasury bills tromthe primary market declined significantly during the fir-stthree quarters of 2003, although some of the bills at the last

few auctions in the year were taken up by the Central Bank to

meet the expected seasonal demand for liquidity. TotalTreasury bills purchased by the Central Bank in 2003

amounted to Rs.49 billion, significantly lower than the

purchases in2002 (Rs.94 billion). The Central Bank also usedits stock of Treasury bills for OMO. The net effect of these

transactions was that the holdings of government paper by the

Central Bank declined by Rs.29 billion to Rs I I billion at end

2003.

Central Bank Repo and Reverse Repo Market

The continuous excess liquidity in the market resulted in the

Central Bank conducting mainly repurchase transactions toabsorb the excess. Total repo transactions increased to

Rs.2,445 billion in 2003 from Rs.1,076 billion in 2002. The

repurchase facility was mainly on an overnight basis although

a f'ew repos with longer maturities were conducted through

direct deals in order to absorb liquidity on a more long-term

basis. Reverse repurchase transactions were conducted on afew days during the year when market liquidity was short,The total volume of reverse repurchase transactions

amounted to Rs.7.3 billion, significantly lower than in 2002(Rs.l54 billion).

Secondary Market for Government Securities

A significant rise in volumes traded has been observed in2003 with the interest rates declining and a growing

popularity of secondary trading in government securities. The

Iargest increase has been in repos, which have increased by

over 60 per cent to Rs.1,058 million, as indicated by returnssubmitted by primary dealers on secondary market

transactions, where the primary dealer is one party to the

transaction . There was a gradual decline in yield rates in the

secondary market across all maturities, reflecting the trend in

the primary market.During the year, several measures were taken to deepenmarket activity. A Bloomberg Bond Trading System was

commenced, where the Primary Dealers (PDs) could maketwo-way quotes, which would improve the transparency oftrading. The CBSL and PDs conducted several investorawareness programmes. In addition, measures were also

taken to reduce the number of series of Treasury bond issues'This is expected to increase the liquidity of the issues and

facilitate benchmarking. The trading in the secondary marketis expected to further improve with the introduction of aScripless Securities Settlement (SSS) System and theimplementation of a trading platform for government

securities at the Colombo Stock Exchange in early 2004'

Central Bank Securities

Given the highly liquid state of the market and the signiticant

decline in the Central Bank's stock of govemment paper, the

Central Bank issued its own securities in September, 2003 to

mop up excess liquidity. The total value of Central Bank

securities issued in 2003 amounted to Rs.5 billion. The

maturity period of these securities was 9l days or less, given

that the Central Bank usually operate at the short end of themarket. Consequently, by end 2003, all Central Bank

securities had been repaid.

borrowing by large corporates continued to provide investorswith alteLnative investment opportunity. However, the issues

of commercial paper declined significantly in 2003, reflectinghigher liquidity in the market and the increasingcompetitiveness in bank lending rates. Total issues of

commercial paper declined by over 50 per cent in 2003 toRs.l l.l billion. The majority of commercial paper were

supported by commercial banks.

Foreign Exchange Market

Large foreign exchange inflows from worker remittances,

earnings from tourism and higher capital inflows provided

the liquidity needed to stimulate the foreign exchange market'

The higher inflow of foreign exchange enabled the Central

Bank to purchase around US dollars 375 million during theyear to enhance its foreign exchange reserves. Greateractivity was also witnessed in the foreign exchange marketwith trading volumes in the inter bank market increasing by

around 44per cent over the volumes in 2002 to US dollars 3.6billion in 2003. The turnover increased to an average of US

dollars 304 million per month in 2003 from US dollars 212million in2002. The introduction of the US dollar clearingfacility at LankaClear (Pvt) Ltd., has increased the etficiencyand reduced the cost of clearing cheques and drafts

denominated in US dollars. With a view to further deepening

the foreign exchange market the net open position of banks

was raised to 20 per cent of capital and reserve tunds fiom thecurrent I5 per cent for banks with the required capital

adequacy ratio. A significant development in 2003 was the

rise in forward transactions by over 48 per cent to US dollars

1,401 million. Reflecting the stability in the market andmarket developments, there was a shift towards forward

contracts of longer maturity and a decline in folward plemia.

Capital Market

Stock Market

The upward trend in market activity at the Colombo Stock

in 2003, with performance improving further during the year.

Both primaty and secondary market activity picked up during

the year, with key malket indicators reaching record levels by

October. Foreign investors were net buyers at the Colombo

A tax amnesty granted bythe government, which was effective tilr August, may havebeen another contributory factor to the incieased marketactivity during 2003.Earlier in the year, however, a downturn in marketactivity was seen around March, due to fears of the waragainst Iraq negatively impacting upon sri Lanka's exports,and inward private remittances, and therefore the exchangerate.

Medium and Long-term Government Securities

Treasury BondsIn line with the debt management strategy of moving tomarket-oriented tradable debt instruments, net issues ofTreasury bonds were increased in 2003. Further, along withthe decline in policy rates and market interest rates, increasedreliance was placed on Treasury bonds, as bonowing throughshort-term debt instruments, namely Treasury bills, wasreduced. A key development during the year was thatTreasury bonds with 10-year, l5-year and 20-year maturitieswere issued, thus elongating the yield curve for governmentsecurities and establishing benchmark yield rates forlong-tenure debt instruments. Meanwhile, the yield curve forTreasury bonds shifted further downwards during the year,following the decline in2002.The introduction of the Bloomberg Bond Tradingsystem for Primary Dealers at the initiative of the centralBank was another important development, in relation tomarket infrastructure in the government securities market.Meanwhile, necessary steps were taken during the year tofacilitate trading in the beneficiar interest of governmentsecurities on the Colombo Stock Exchange and, on2I lanuary 2004, the Colombo Stock Exchange commencedthe operation of the debt securities trading system. with these

Unit Trusts

Unit trusts, a type of pooled investment funds, had a strong

record in terms of rates of return in 2003. The number of unit

trust being managed by tive institutions, decreased to l2 at

end 2003 from l3 at end 2002, following the redemption of

units in a time-bound fund that was started in 2002. There

were three growth funds, three balanced funds, one indexfund and five income funds, Due to relatively heavy

redemptions, both total assets and net assets of the industry,

however, declined by 24 pel cent from Rs.4.4 billion in2002

to Rs.3.6 billion in 2003. The boom in the share market and

the appreciation in the value of investments in fixed income

securities as a result of falling interest rates, caused a rise in

unit prices of some funds, motivating investors, particularly

institutional investors, to redeem at a profit the investments

made at the inception of some funds, The average unit price,

as measured by the per unit net asset value increased byl7 per cent over the previous year to Rs.11.23. The relatively

large redemptions by unit holders and the termination of a

fund were the contributory factot's for the decline in the

industry in terms of assets, number of unit holdels and the

number of units issued,

The investment portfolio deceased to Rs.3.6 billion at

end 2003 from Rs.4,4 billion at end 2002, while the buying

and selling prices langed between Rs.7.50-19.50 and

Rs.8.00-21.00, respectively. The share of equity investmentsin the portfolio increase d while the that of government

securities decreased, due to funds reallocating their portfolios

in favour of equities, in the expectation of highet returns from

the booming share market.

Although unit trusts are in a position to provide investors

with the benefits of diveLsification, the industry has not been

able to grow at a satisfactory rate due to number of factors,

among which are the relatively high volatility in the equity

market, lack of a broader range of financial assets and

investors' appetrte for sholt-term quick gains.

10.14 Financial System Stability

During the year, a number of measures were taken to furtherpromote financial system stability, which is one of the rwocore objectives of the Bank. The central Bank focussed onstrengthening the resilience of the banking sector, whichaccounts fbr about 60 per cent of the assets of the financialsector. Action was also taken to develop the infiastructure inpayments and settlement systems and the government

ntroduced a code of best practices tor2002, which is expected to improvernance and contribute to greaterr risk management practices.

Strengthening Prudential Supervision forRisk Mitigation

The GBSL has taken the initiative to enhance the resilience ofbanks to risks by expanding the scope of prudential

domestic banking operations, were extended to encompassthe operations of the off-shore banking units as well, ihusensuring that prudential limits were followed with respect tothe operations of the entire bank. Thus, capital adequacyratios, statutory liquid assets ratios and Iarge credit exposureIimits are now applied to the offshore units as weil.In addition, in keeping with Basel core principles oneffective bank supervision, compliance with CAR on aconsolidated basis, along with 'Bank only' or 'Solo basis'was also introduced,Lending by banks in sri Lanka is heaviry coilaterar-oliented. consequently, heavy reliance is placed on collateralas a credit risk mitigant rather than on improving riskmanagement in credit approvals by paying due attention tothe viability of projects and their cash tlow projections, whilebuilding up reserves to cover any potential losses, through themore prudent banking concept of the allocation of reservesout of profits for loan losses. As a consequence, the valuationof collateral has a significant impact on the level of loan lossprovisions set aside by banks. In order to induce moreprudent accounting for loan losses, a new direction requiringthe application of a progressive discount on the value ofcollateral for provisioning purposes on advances classifled asloss, where there was no hope of recovery, was introducedand is to take effect fiom 0l Januarv 2004.

In order to enhance the level of tr.ansparency, ensureappropriate dissemination of information ro the public andpromote discipline through market fbrces, CBSL has requiredthat all banks publish their quarterly accounts with minimumdisclosure requirements in the press, in addition to publishingthe audited annual accounts.

Risks and Capitat Adequacy

credit risk mitigation in the bankin_q sector was enhancedwith incleased levels of provisioning against credit defaults.This was largely seen in the state bank sector, where between65-75 per cent of some banks non-per.forming assets (NpA)have been provisioned foL. However, within the bankingsector, there is heavy reliance on collaterar values as a creditrisk mitigant, which need to increase its provisioning, toturther improve its resilience.The level of provisions for loan losses have seen agradual increase across the board over the past few years andrepresented nearly 5l per cent of the NpL portfolio in theindustry by 2003. As a result, the NpL rario net of provisions,was approximately equivalent to half the gross NpL ratio tbr2003.It is envisaged that the introduction of the haircut fbrthe valuation of collateral for provisioning purposes, withetfect from January 2004, would increase roan loss provisionsrequired in 2004. The increasing tendency for reliance oncollateral for credit risk mitigation would be discour.agedfrom 2004 when progressive discounts will be required onsuch collateral, necessitating increased provisioning acrossthe board.Capital should serve as a buffer- against unexpectedlosses, reflecting the risk profile of a bank. capital funds inthe indust'y have indicated an increasing trend, especiallyover the last two years, primarily on account of the internalgeneration of capital through improved profitability. Theinfusion of market capital through the issue of debt andequity by banks has been another contributory factor, that hashelped to strengthen the capital position of banks.The average capital adequacy ratio (CAR) for theindustry has displayed some fluctuation, with the graduallyincreasing trend in 2002 turning to a decreasing trend in2003, The dectease was mainly attributed to the applicationof the minimum regulatory capital adequacy r.atio to theForeign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs) of banks witheff'ect f'om 2003. The industry average cAR was below thestatutory minimum of l0 per cenr imposed by the CBSL.Although this was above the inte'national norm of g per centstipulated by the Basel committee, the levels of capital needto be improved to support the potential risk profiles of themajor banks in the industry,

Part IChapter 10 - FINANCIAL SECTOR

Should there be a Financial Safety Net?

The number and frequency of bank failures in the rvorld

have increased rapidly in the recent past. The experiencein East Asia and elsewhere has brought to the fbie theimportance of the stability of financial systems forensuring the sustainability of openness in invi-eorated

economic growth,

The hallmark of a sound tind stable financial market

is investor conlidence. A financial saf'ety net for ensuringinvestor confidence includes mechanisms that have thefollowing dual objectives: (c) containing the disruptive

consequences of financial distress once it arises (crisismanagement), and (b) instilling confidence in thefinancial system so as to limit the risks (crisis prevention).A flnancial safety net, thus, covers four main elements:

emergency liquidity assistance (Lender-of last resorlfacility from the central bank;, deposit protection

schemes, exit policies and prudential t'egulation andsupervision of financial institutions. In the absence ofsuch safety net arrangements, financial failures impose

enormous costs on indii'idual investors and the economyas a whole. Deposit insurance is one such safetymechanism with which the losses of the so-calledt'unsophisticated" depositors in banks can be minimised,

albeit to a stipulated limit, in case banks fail, and theleby

help arrest the cataclysmic impact of bank runs, However,providing of deposit insurance alone is neither a

necessary, nor a sufficient condition fbr ensurin-{ financialstabiliry. Deposit insurance poses moral hazard lisks that

can invite imprudent behaviour by bank management orpoor choices by depositors. Therefore, what is of

importance is to ensure that deposiq insurance is providedon efficient lines and does not guarantee complete

reinstatement.As Mr. Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board ofGovernors of the US Federal Reserve System recentlypointed out, a sal'ety:net, along with improved

understanding of the use of monetary and fiscal policies,

has played a critical role in eliminating bahk runs and in

assuaging financial cnses, and reducing the frequency and

amplitude of economic contractions. Deposit Insurance,the discount tvindow, and access to central bank

emergenc), liquidity provide depository institutions andfinancial market participants with safety and liquidity.

There are however costs of such safety net arrangementsin the form of distortions in plice signals used to allocate

reseurces, excessive risk-taking and greater got'ernment

supervision and regulati on.

Box 21

Insur-ed depositols may be simply indiffer-ent, and

othel creditors too often less sensitive than they would beto the risks taken by banks because of both the reality andthe perception of their uwn safety under a depositinsurance scheme. Market discipline in one form or

another has been the mEor governor of bank risk-taking.By deterring Iiquidity panics, deposit insurance couldshield the economy from some of the worst effects ofinstability in the banking system, The safety net enablesbanks to accumulate larger, riskier asset portfolios thanwouid be possible in an intermediation process drivensolely by market forces. In the absence of a saf'ety net,

these higher lending risks would have to be let-lected in

some conrbination of higher deposit costs, more liquid

asset holdings, ol a larger capital base, Or, conversely,

these adjustments would constrain the risk-taking by

banks. But, with the safety net, lower interest rates andhi-qher credit availability are accorded to riskier
