The Bank rate(i.e., the late applicable for lending to commercial banks asthe lender of last resort) was also reduced fiom 18.00 per-centto 15.00 per cent to keep it in line with the trends in thecent'al Bank's other policy rates. In view of the reducedvolatility in money market rates, and the downward shiftingof the interest late structule, lhe width of the corridor formedby the Bank's Repo and Reserve Repo r.ates was reduced to150 basis points from 200 basis points. The reduction inpolicy interest rates resulted in a reduction in all other marketrates, although some lending rates were slow in adjusting,causing the interest rate spread to rise. A fastel decline ininflatron has resulted in a rise in some market interest ratesin real terms. The Central Bank has taken measures roimprove the interest rate pass-through in the banking indusrry(see Box l9).The Central Bank has been taking steps to improve the,etfectrveness of its monetary policy. As a part of this process,the Bank moved to a more active system of open marketoperations (OMO), fl'om 03 March, 2003. Under this system,the Central Bank would decide on the quanrum of riquidity tobe supplied ol withdrawn, but the interest rates would bedetermined by the market iorces, However, fbr the market rodetermine the appropriate rate, the interest rate corridorformed by the Bank's Repo and Reverse Repo rates wouldsrgnal the direction of the policy stance. Active OMO arecaLried out through daily auctions to inject or absorb riquiditybased on the monetary policy stance and the estimated marketliquidity. This is in contrast to the earlier.system, where therate was fixed by the Central Bank, while the volume wasdetermined by the market. Under the new active OMO, tohelp the market to ope'ate smoothly, standing facilities arealso available to market participants at Repo/Reverse Reporates, so that they could square up any excess/shorttall inmarket liquidity. Under the new monetary policymanagement system there is greater public disclosure as theBank's monetary policy stance is announced monthly as peran advance release calendar. These regular announcementshave enhanced transparency and credibility of monetarymanagement, while enhancing the predictability of theBank's policy stance. This more active system of OMOhas helped to achieve greater stability in money market rates(see Box 4).Under the system of more active OMO, the CBSL tookmeasures to absorb a part of the excess liquidity on along-term basis, as this improves the eftectiveness of OMOand helps to reduce transaction costs of banks in investingexcess liquidity on an overnight basis. Accordingly, sales ofTreasu'y bills were made by calling dealer bids directly andthrough auctions. As the CBSL holdings of government",

NFA of the bantiing system rose byaround Rs.56 billion during 2003 as a result of higher foreignremittances, increased receipts under services and capitalflows to both the government and the private sector includingthe receipt of foreign grants and loans. The increase waslargely (82 per cent) reflected in the NFA of the centralBank, which rose by Rs.47 billion, reflecting the surplus ofUS dollars 502 million in the Bop. NFA of commercialbanks too improved by Rs.9 biltion, partly as a result oftncreased investment in foreign currency assets abroad, fiomthe proceeds of the repayment of sri Lanka DevelopmentBonds (sLDBs) amounting ro US doilars l5g milrion, whichare treated as domestic assets in the monetary survey.Net credit to government (NCG) from the bankingsystem declined for the second consecutive year, reflectingimproved fiscal management and commitment to fiscalconsolidation.

At present, 82 institutions, including alllicensed commercial banks, licensed specialised banks,registered finance companies, registered leasingestablishments, and the Central Bank, are shareholders ofCRIB.CRIB currently collects infbrmation on regular advancesof Rs.500,000 and over, and irregular advances of Rs.100,000and over, The number of credit reports issued during the yearincreased to 389,171 from285,269 in2002, reflecting higherdemand for credit with the recovery in economic activity andalso demonstrating that credit information is used as animportant risk management tool by lending institutions. Thisincreased demand for credit information contributed to asharp increase in the Bureau's profits, to Rs.32.9 million in2003, from Rs.24.5 million in2002.The number of advances recorded in the databaseamounted to 159,500 in 2003, compared with 139,500 in2002. Of the number of advances in 2003, 106,000 advanceswere regular, while 53,500 were irregular advances (advanceswhich are more than six months in default). The value ofirregular advances in the database was about Rs.l03 billioncompared with about Rs.99 billion in 2002. Of the rotalirregular advances, 74 per cent were accounted for by thecorporate sector, while the balance was accounted for byindividual borrowers. More than 90 per cent of these inegularadvances were advances over one million ruDees.",

The FSC system will ensure a fair price fbr thefarmers' ploduce, minimising the impact of rapid fluctuationsin prices realised by the farmers.This plogramme was supported by the World Bank byproviding necessary funds under its Development MarketPlace Pro;ect and it was implemented from April ,2002 toJune, 2003. The central Bank implemented the project withthe participation of Bank of Ceylon, people's Bank, SeylanBank, Comme'cial Bank, six RDBs and Sarvodaya SEEDS asfacilitators of the contracts. This pilot project, aimed atpiomoting sales contract systems among farmers, buyers,bankers, policy makers and the general public, wassuccessfully completed in 2003, Under- the project,2,3g4awafeness programmes were held in all major agriculturalareas of the country with the participation of t21,000persons, In addition to the meetings and workshops, booklets,posters and documentaries were prepared in sinhala, Tamiland English to propagate the concept of the Forward SalesContract System.Undet the project, in addition to awareness/publicityprogrammes, the particrpatin-q institutions were plovided withmotorcycles and computers for promotion of the system inthe respective areas.

The Ministry of RuralEconomy introduced several credit schemes such as'Athamaru', 'Diriyalanda' and 'Gemira' to be implementedthrough RDBs in order to diversify the microfinance servicesoffered by them. The Ministry has also intLoduced theProduction Specialised Villages Programme with a view toenhancing the productive capacity of people in selectedvillages that specialise in a particular product by using theresources available in those villages. The cost of theeconomic infrastructure development of these villages, asidentified under the programme, is to be borne by the RuralEconomic Resuscitation Trust Fund of the Ministry, while theRDBs are expected to provide necessary microfinanceservices in those villages.A large segment of Iower and middle income groups livein semi-urban and rural areas in the Colombo District, whichdo not enjoy the facilities provided by the RDBs. In addition,a considelable number of the urban poor and lower-middleincome earners living in urban areas are in need of bankingfacilities for improvement of their economic activities. Withthe objective of expanding bankin_e tacilities to these people,the administrative district of Colombo was included in theregion of the Sabar-agamuwa Development Bank (SDB) witheffect from l5 September 2003, increasing the total numberof districts served by the RDBs to eighteen.

The RTGS sysrem willfacilitate lalge value fund transf'ers and settlement in real timerather than at the end of the day as was done previously. It isexpected to boost activity in the money market. This is animportant development in the payments system as it reducessettlement risk and enhances the stability and reliability of thepayments system.

As a result, the NpL rario net of provisions,was approximately equivalent to half the gross NpL ratio tbr2003.It is envisaged that the introduction of the haircut fbrthe valuation of collateral for provisioning purposes, withetfect from January 2004, would increase roan loss provisionsrequired in 2004. The increasing tendency for reliance oncollateral for credit risk mitigation would be discour.agedfrom 2004 when progressive discounts will be required onsuch collateral, necessitating increased provisioning acrossthe board.Capital should serve as a buffer- against unexpectedlosses, reflecting the risk profile of a bank. capital funds inthe indust'y have indicated an increasing trend, especiallyover the last two years, primarily on account of the internalgeneration of capital through improved profitability. Theinfusion of market capital through the issue of debt andequity by banks has been another contributory factor, that hashelped to strengthen the capital position of banks.The average capital adequacy ratio (CAR) for theindustry has displayed some fluctuation, with the graduallyincreasing trend in 2002 turning to a decreasing trend in2003, The dectease was mainly attributed to the applicationof the minimum regulatory capital adequacy r.atio to theForeign Currency Banking Units (FCBUs) of banks witheff'ect f'om 2003. The industry average cAR was below thestatutory minimum of l0 per cenr imposed by the CBSL.Although this was above the inte'national norm of g per centstipulated by the Basel committee, the levels of capital needto be improved to support the potential risk profiles of themajor banks in the industry,",
