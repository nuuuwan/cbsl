MODERNISATION OF THE CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA

Modernisation Programme

The modernisation prqect of the central Bank of sri Lanka(CBSL) completed its fourth year in 2003. The progressachieved by the project during the past three years has beenreported in the previous Annual Reports of the Bank (seePart II-(Page II)-2000, Parr II-(Box II-l) 2001 ancl parr II_(Box tI- l)-2002). The modernisation project aims arbuilding a central bank which is in line with the moderntrends in central banking and which is capable ofsuc.cessfully rnecting the new challenges faced by a centralbank.A summary of the activities completed during 2000 _2002 is as follows:. Redefining CBSL's objec,tives into two new coreobjectives, viz., (a) economic and price stability; and(b) financial system stability, with a view io encouragin_qand promoting the development of productive resourcesof Sri Lanka. This was effected through an amendnrenrto the Monetary Law Act in December 2002.In terms ofthis amendment, the CBSL has been fieed of pursuingmultiple objectives, which are usually in conflict witheach other. Hence, the Bank can now vigoi.ously andcorisisLently pur.\ue its core objectives.. Dcvolution of non-core functions- The Sri l-anka Automated Clearing House was divestedby the CBSL in April 2002 ro l.ankaClear (pvt) Ltd.,with the aim of impnrving the etlciency of the ohequeclearing and electronic funds transfer system throughnew management, technology and cost efficientoperations.- Outsourcing: T'he CBSL outsourced niany of its non.core functions, particularly in the area of services.thereby enabling the Bank to usc its resourcesexclusively tbr attaining the core objectives.. Action was initiated to amalgamate the EpF and ETF ;uldto divest shares held by the CBSI. in rhe ResionalDevelopment Banks (RDBs).. Organisational Changes- A new organisation structure was established.categorising departments under the primary objectivesor by functional groups, i.e., price stability, financialsystem stability, agency and business functions andcorporate services.- Cerlain departments werc amalgamatecl, re-designatccland reconstituted to suit the new necds of the Bank.

. Human Resource and Training- With the aim of introducing a new culture andenhancing professionalism amongst the staff, a set ofnew human resource policies was adopted. For thispurpose, a Human Resource Manager was recruited inApril2A02.- The Management Development Centre was establishe<ito continuously train senior officials of banks andpublic sector institutions, with the aim of enhancingtheir knowiedge through education. awareness andcritical analysis.- A Voluntary Retirement Scheme was ottered to thestaff and 690 employees opted to retire under thisscheme. This has been tbllowed up with simplifrcationof work procedures and automation of work processes.. Governance- The CBSL established advisory technical committeesystems to streamline the decision-making process.Clommittee.s have been appointed to advise andrecommend to the Monetary Board on monetarypolicy, financial system stabiiity and auditin,e.- The Monetary Board was enhanced by increasing itsmembership fiom 3 to 5, which facilitated two moreprivate sector representatives in the Board.- The Bank adopted International Acconnting Standardsfor its accounts, r,vhich lacilitatecl a comparable andacceptable disclosure policy and brought the accountsin line with international best practices.

During 2003, further progress was made in themodemisation project. Some of the key areas which wereconcluded during the year are as fbllows:. New Human Resource and Training policies- The CBSI- r'ecruited a consultant to advise andinrplement new hunran resource ;rolicies for the Bank.In this process, a blueprint was completed in the areasof performance evaluation and progress was made withregard to the updating of the Human ResourcesManual.- With the aim of building the skills and fhe competenceol staff continuously, comprehensive trainingopportunities have been provided in accordance withthe training plan prepared by the Bank. This plan hasbeen formulated with the objective of converting CBSLto a 'leaming organisation', so that skills upgrading

Part llAccounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

would be done by the employees themselves in asustainable manne[.- The Management Development Centre continued withits activities of providing High Level Trainin_e to thebank staff and public sector officials, by organisingprogrammes based on a 'demand-driven' approach.

Capacity Building- Financial Sector Stability - Being a core objective ofthe Bank, it is important to ensure that the BankSupervision Department (BSD) is well-geared in itssupervisory functions of banks. Accordin-ely, the CBSL

contracted the services of a consultant to strengthen theBSD, with the ajm of ensurin_e the development of asound banking sector in Sri Lanka. With thisassistance, BSD is in the process of updating itsprudential regulations to international standards andstrengthenin-q its on-site and off-site supervisoryf'unctions. The staff of the department have also beenprovided continuous trainin_s to enable them to performtheir supervisory functions effectively.- E-mail and Internet Facilities - In keeping with themodern era of office automation, the Banl'i has nradeavailable e-mail facilities to the entire staff andprovided easy access to Internet facilities.

Legal Reforms - The assistance of le-qal expefts from theWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund wasobtained for a comprehensive review of the MonetaryLau,Act (MLA) and the Bankin-e Act (BA). The CBSLintends to introduce a new Central Banking Act, whichwill replace the existing MLA, and a new BA to replacethe existing bankin-e legislation.

Accountin-[ and Auditin-u - The CBSL continued toprepare its accounts based on Intemational AccountingStandards and audited in terms of the InternationalFinancial Reporting Standards- The Bank has also

adopted a new internal audit charter to hal'e its accountson a comparable basis with clther central banks and to bein line with international best practices.

Technological Improvements- Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) Systenr - TheBank implemented a RTGS system in September 2003.The RTGS system facilitates Iar-{e value fund transfers

and settlement on an electronic basis in real time ratherthan settiing at the end of the day. It expedites firndtransfers among banks, primary dealers. financialinstitutions, investors, customers, the -eovernment andthe public. This system will also bring about _ereaterfinancial discipline in the banking sector, since banks

BOXII -1(Contd.)

will have to maintain adequate cash and reserves intheir accounts to meet their payment obligations, as thesystem will instantaneously update their settlement

accounts afler each transaction. This rvill improve theliquidity management of banks as treasurers and fund

mana,qers will hal'e to produce accurate estimates oftheir liquidity requirements.- Scripless Securities Settlement (SSS) System - Amajor component of the work relating to the SSS

system was completed during 2003.In February 2004,

the SSS module was integrated with the RTGS system,To tacilitate operations, government securities rvereissued in scripless form with effect from 30 January2004. The SSS system would facilitate the issue of

scripless securities. and their transf'er among investolswith a simultaneous settlement of funds through theRTGS on a Delivery vâ‚¬rsus Payment basis (DvP

settlement), Sn Lanka's integrated RTGS/SSSS will beknown as "LankaSettle".Since the system will operate electronically andon-line, dealing in government securities will beconvenient to all market participants, i.e. primary

dealers, banks and investors. The Central DepositorySystem (CDS) will be the title registry as well as the

custodian for governmenf securities. The ownership ofsecurities will be recorded electronically in the CDS.The holders of scripless securities in the CDS will be

issued confirmations of transactions as well as periodicaccounts statements of their holdings. The SSSS andCDS have been brand-named 'LankaSecure'.- Treasury Dealing Room Management System(TDRMS) - The Bank also completed work relatingto TDRMS durin_q the year. The system went live inJanuary 2004, and will facilitate deal capture,authorisation, risk management and settlement offbreign exchange and fixed income securities.- General kdger (GL) System - The automation of GLrvas completed durin-e the year and the system wentlive in August 2003. This has replaced the manual andsemi-automated system adopted by the Bank, which

was also decentralised in several departments, This hashelped the creation of an effective Budgeting and

Man a-ee ment Int-ormati on System.

Divestment of Agency Functions- EPF and ETF - The work relatin_9 to the amalgamationof EPF and ETF progressed satisfactorily and a

unless otherwise stated.

(iv) Changes in Accounting Policies

The Bank adopted trade date accounting for all financial assetsresulting from 're_eular way' purchases and sales as in view ofthe mana-eement, trade date accounting improves the fairpresentation of the asset and liability position of the bank.Regular purchases and sales were earlier recognised onsettlement date basis.

currency activities mainly arise from the Bank's foreignreserves management function. Local curency activities mainlyreflect the assets and liabilities associated with monetary policyimplementation, investment of the proceeds of issuing currencyand banking activities.The separate reporting of these activities is considered toprovide a better presentation of the Bank's financial position,financial performance and risk profile. The Bank considers thatthe combined reporting of foreign and local currency activitieswould weaken the informational value of the financialstatements.All investments are initially recognised at cost, being thefair value of the consideration given and including acquisitioncharges associated with the investment. After initiairecognition,subsequent measurement bases are described below, Allieeularway purchases and sales of financiar assets are recogniri onthe trade date. Regular way purchases or sales are purchasesor sales of financial assets that require delivery of assits withinthe time frame generaily established by reguration orconvention in the market place.

As a result of this change in accounting poricy, financiarassets, which the Bank is committed to purchase, are caniedat fair value. The fair value of these financiar assets at 3 rDecember 2003 is Rs.5,439,95g (2002_R s.2,361,9g1), Thechange in fair value is accounted for in compliance with therespectrve accounting poricies for the recognition of fair varuegains and losses of the resurtant financiar assets. Thecorresponding liabilities are accounted for similarry to thefinancial assets and recorded as amounts payabre to Bank andFinancial Institutions.The effect of the change in Accounting poricy on thecomparative figures is shown above.

(v) Foreign Currency Conversions

Transactions in foreign currencies have been translated to SriLanka rupees using exchange rates apprying on the trade dateof transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated inforeign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruringat the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the Incomestatement.

realised (through selling the gold), this is reported as Gain

(Loss) Realised from Price Changes.

(x) International Monetary Fund Balances

The Bank transacts with the Intemational Monetary Fund (IMF)

in its own right rather than as an agent for the Govemment of

Sri Lanka, All transactions by the Bank with the IMF have been

included in these financial statements on that basis.

Quota with the IMF is recorded by the Bank as an asset

and the amount payable to the IMF for quota is recorded as aliability of the Bank. The cumulative allocation of SDRs by

the IMF is treated as a liability. Exchange gains and lossesarising on revaluation of IMF assets and liabilities at the

exchange rate applying at balance sheet date as published by

the IMF are recognised in the Income Statement.All other charges and interest pertaining to balances with

the IMF are recorded immediately in the Income Statement.

(xi) Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at foreign banks and

financial institutions and short-term deposits with an original

maturity of three months or less.As a part of local currency activities, CBSL generates

certain income and incurs expenses, which do not involve in

movement of cash. Those activities result in certain assets andliabilities as well and mainly comprise the transactions with

GOSL and transactions with domestic banks and tlnancial

institutions. Transactions with GOSL basically represent the

purchase of un-subscribed portions of Treasury bills and bonds

that are issued by the government by the Bank as a mechanismto control liquidity. Such purchases, disposals or interest

thereon are reflected as mere book entries in the records of

CBSL.As the sole statutory authority, CBSL issues currency to

the public in line with the Monetary Law Act. Cunency issuedby CBSL represents a claim on the Bank in favour of the

holder. This is a liability on the part of the CBSL while it is

an item of cash in the hands of the holder. Movement in

circulation culrency is included as part of financing activitiesin line with prevailing industry practice among those central

banks which present cash flow statements.

CBSL through the cash/pay order process disburses cash

in the form of notes and coins or cheques drawn on CBSL, to

various drawees including suppliers and employees for goods

and services obtained, which is either added to the cunency in

circulation liability or balances with commercial banks. Such

forms of utilisation of currency for the purposes of CBSL's

payments form part of cash outflows of CBSL,For the purposes of the Cash Flow Statement, cash and

cash equivalents consist ofcash and cash equivalents as defined

above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts,

(xii) Repurchase and Reverse-RepurchaseTransactions

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase continue to be

recorded as trading or available for sale securities in the Balance

Sheet. The obligation to repurchase (Securities Sold under

Agreements to Repurchase) is disclosed as a liability. The

difference between the sale and repurchase price in repurchase

transactions and the purchase price and sale price in reverse

repurchase transactions represents an expense and is expensedin the Income Statement.

Securities held under reverse-repurchase agreements are

recorded as an asset in the Balance Sheet (Securities Purchased

Under Agreements to Re-sell). Both repurchase and reverse-

repurchase transactions are reported at the transaction value,

inclusive of any accrued income or expense.(xiii) Investment Portfolio - Sri Lanka GovernmentSecurities

The Bank's investment portfolio consists of Treasury bills

purchased from the Government of Sri Lanka. The portfolio is

recorded in the Balance Sheet at amortised cost since they

represent loans originated by the Bank.

Loans to Government represents direct provisional advances

made to the Government of Sri Lanka under Section 89 of the

Monetary Law Act, No. 58 of 1949 as amended.

(xv) Loans to Other Institutions

Loans granted to Other Institutions are recognised and carriedat the original granted amount less an allowance for any

uncollectable amounts. An allowance for doubtful debts (for

loan impairment) is established if there is objective evidence

that the Bank will not be able to collect all amounts due. The

amount of the provision is the difference between the canying

amount.and the estimated recoverable amount. Bad debts are

written off when identified.(xvi) Foreign Currency Term Liabilities

Foreign currency term liabilities are subsequently reported at

amortised cost of the liabilities. Changes in the value of these

liabilities are recognised as an increase or decrease in the valueof the term liabilities in the Balance Sheet. Gains and lossesarising from changes in value of foreign currency term

liabilities are recognised immediately as expenses in the Income

Statement. Where the liability is still owed, the gain or loss is

reported as (Gain) Loss from Unrealised Price Revaluation.

Where the gain or loss has been realised (through repayment

of the liability), this is reported as (Gains) Losses Realised from

Price Changes.

(xvii) Derivative Instruments

The Bank's involvement in derivative instruments is mainly in

forward foreisn exchanse contracts. Such derivative financial

(xrr)Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Repoft - 2003

rnstruments are stated at fair varue. The fair value of fbrwardexchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forwardexchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.All denvative instruments in a gain or loss position arereported within the balance of foreign currency trading oravailable for sale securities in the Balance Sheet.(xviii) Other Financial Assets and LiabilitiesLocal and foreign currency cash, deposits and short-termadvances are recognised on trade date.(xix) Investment in Associates

The Bank's investments in associates, together with the onesthat are held for subsequent disposal are accounted for underthe cost method.

(xx) Gold Inventory

Gold inventory, which is a higtrly liquid commodity, is caniedat cost.

(xxi) Inventories

Inventories are canied at lower of cost or realisable value. Costis determined on a First in First out basis, Allowance is madefor slow moving inventories.(xxii) Property, Plant and EquipmentAll items of property, plant and equipment are initially recordedat cost. Land and buildings are subsequently re-valued, on anasset-by-asset basis, to their fair values. Revaluations are madewith sufficient regularity to ensure that their carrying amountdoes not differ materially from their fair value at the balancesheet date.The carrying amounts, both those re_valued and thosemeasured at cost, are reviewed at each balance sheet date toassess whether they are recorded in excess of their recoverableamount, and if canying values exceed this recoverable amount.assets are written down.When an asset is revalued, any increase in the canyingamount is credited directly to a revaluation reserve unless itreverses a previous revaluation decrease relating to the sameasset which was previously recognised as an expense. In thesecircumstances, the increase is recognised as income to theextent of the previous write down. when an asset's canyingamount is decreased as a result of a revaluation, the decreaseis recognised as an expense unless it reverses a previousincrement relating to that asset, in which case it is chargedagainst any related revaluation reserve, to the extent that thedecrease does not exceed the amount herd in the revaluationreserve in respect of that same asset. Any balance remainingin the revaluation reserve in respect of an asset, is transferreddirectly to retained earnings on retirement or. rdisposal of theasset.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight line method overthe following estimated useful lives.

Retirement Grataity

The Retirement Gratuity is a Defined Benefit Plan. The Bank

is liable to pay gratuity fbr the employees who are not eligiblefor the pension scheme. In order to meet this liability, aprovision is carried forward in the balance sheet, equivalent to

an amount calculated using a formula based on a half month'ssalary of the last month of the financial year of eligibleemployees for each completed year of service, commencingfrom the first year of service. The resulting difference between

the brought forward provision at the beginning of a year and

the carried forward provision at the end of a year represent a

charge to the income statement. The gratuity liability is neitherfunded nor actuarially valued. This item is grouped under

Provisions in the Balance Sheet.

Employees' Provident Fund andEmployees'Trust Fund

Employees are eligible for Employees' Provident Fund

contributions and Employees' Trust Fund contributions in linewith the respective statutes and regulations. The Bankcontributes 24 per cent and 3 per cent of employees' gross

emoluments to the Employees' Provident Fund and Employees'Trust Fund, respectively, which are separately administered

defined contribution plans.

(xxviii) Grants

Grants are recognised at their fair value where there is a

reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all

attaching conditions, if any, will be complied with are shownunder equity. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is

recognised in the lncome Statement over the penods necessaryto match them to the expenses it is intended to compensate on

a systematic basis. Where the grant relates to an asset, the fair

value is credited to a def-ened government grant account andis released to the Income Statement over the expected usefullife of the relevant asset on a systematic basis, consistent with

the depreciation policy of the related asset.

(xxix) Personnel Expenses

Personnel Expenses include the full cost of all staff benefits.Salaries related expenses and leave accrued at year-end are

included in other local payables.

(xxx) Operating Leases

Where the Bank is the lessee, the lease rentals payable on

such interest or discount payable will be liable to l0 per centwithholding tax at the time of payment or crediting of such

lnterest.

(xxxii) Trust and Custodial Activities

Amounts administered by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka under

custodial and administration arrangements are not included in

these fi nancial statements.

(xxxiii) Revenue and Expenses

Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that theeconomic benefits will flow to the Bank and the revenue can

be reliably measured. Expenses are recognised in the income

statement on the basis of a direct association between the costincurred and the earning of specific items of income. Allexpenditure incurred in the running of the business and inmaintaining the property, plant and equipment in a state ofefficiency has been charged to income in arriving at the profitfor the year.The following specific recognition criteria must also be met

before revenue and expenses are recognised:

(A) Interest

Interest income and expense are recognised in the income

statement for all interest bearing instruments on an accrual basisusing the effective yield method based on the actual purchaseprice. lnterest income includes coupons earned on fixed incomeinvestment and trading securities and accrued discount andpremium on treasury bills and other discounted instruments.Interest income is suspended when loans become doubtful ofcollection. Such income is excluded from interest income until

received.

(B) Dividends

(C) Miscellaneous

Miscellaneous income and expenses are recognised on anaccrual basis. Net gains and losses of a revenue nature on thedisposal of property, plant & equipment have been accountedfor in the income statement, having deducted from proceeds

on disposal, the canying amount of the assets and related selling

expenses. On disposal of revalued property, plant & equipment,any amount remaining in Revaluation Reserve relating to that

asset is transferred directly to Accumulated Protit.Gains and losses arising from incidental activities to the main

revenue generating activities and those arising from a group ofsimilar transactions which are not material, are aggregated,reported and presented on a net basis.

(xxxiv) Segmental Reporting

The Bank presents financial assets and financial liabilities, andtheir associated income and expense streams, by distinguishing

Local financial assets, which account for 18.5 per cent of total

assets of the Bank, declined from Rs.85 billion in 2002 to

decrease in Treasury bills by Rs.19.7 billion. Also the

investments in financial and other institutions declined by

Rs.63.5 million as per details below:

Investments in Financial and Other Institutions

The Monetary Law Act, No. 58 of 1949 of Sri Lanka, as

Bank Restructuring

Two LCBs i.e., Union Bank of Colombo Ltd. (UBCL) and theNational Mercantile Bank Ltd. (MERC) were successfully

recapitalised and restructured with the assistance of two

established large banks, This restructuring was canied out under

the supervision of BSD and was facilitated by the necessary

regulatory approvals of the Monetary Board.i. The UBCL was recapitalised and restructured by a

consortium of investors led by the Sampath Bank Ltd.(a LCB) in August 2003. Accordingly, the consortium

infused, fresh equity capital of Rs.525 mn, subscribing to

a different class of ordinary shares. Further, Rs.l00 mn

of capital in the form of debenture proceeds was infused,

increasing the total new capitalinfusion to Rs.625 mn. The

resolution of non-performing loans of the UBCL was

accomplished through the establishment of a SpecialPurpose Vehicle Company (SPV) to which the

non-performing loans were ttansferred. This recapitali-

sation and restructuring process successfully transformed

the weak tlnancial position of the UBCL by restoring thecapital adequacy ratio to over the statutory minimum

requirement of l07o and reducing non- performing loans

considerably.

ii. The MERC Bank was recapitalised and restructured by the

DFCC Bank (a LSB) by the acquisition of a 94Vo stake

of MERC Bank to make it a subsidiary of the DFCC Bank.

Consequent to the recapitalisation, the capital position of

the MERC Bank rose to a level adequate to restore its

capital adequacy ratio to over the statutory minimum

requirement of l0 per cent. The Board of Directors of

MERC Bank was also reconstituted to allow for adequate

representation from the DFCC Bank. Later, the colporate

name of MERC Bank was changed to DFCC Vardhana

Bank Ltd. Its operations which were carried out through

3 branches at the time of restructuring were expanded with

4 more branches established at the premises of 4 branchesof the DFCC Bank,

Resolution of Pramuka Savings &Development Bank Ltd. (PSDB)

Following from the suspension of the business of PSDB inOctober 2002, the Monetary Board decided to cancel the

banking license of thp PSDB and to issue an order in terms of

the provisions of the Monetary Law Act to the Director of Bank

Supervision to take action to wind up the PSDB. This decision

was conveyed to the PSDB on 18 December, 2002.

Subsequently, 5 Court cases by groups of depositors and

the management of the PSDB were flled in the Court of Appeal

challenging the decision of the Monetary Board to have the

bank liquidated and the licence cancelled. The Court of Appeal

issued a writ of certiorari to quash the decision of the Monetary

Board. The Court further issued a mandate in the nature of aWrit of Mandamus on the Monetary Board to consider options

to resume the business of the PSDB.

On 3 July 2003, the Central Bank filed an application in

the Supreme Court for special leave to appeal against the

judgment of the Court of Appeal. Howevet, on a suggestion in

the Supreme Court, the Central Bank agreed to consider further

the options for resuming the business of the PSDB.In order to give effect to the agreement in the Supreme

Court, the Monetary Board suspended the business of the PSDB

again with effect from 22 July 2003. Thereafter, the Central

Bank considered the options for resumption of the business ofthe PSDB during the remaining part of the year 2003 as

highlighted below:On 13 August 2003, the Central Bank published a press

notice in Sinhala. English and Tamil requesting proposals from

interested parties for the rehabtlitation of the PSDB. Initially,six parties expressed interest, but finally the Central Bank

received concept papers/proposals from the following:(a) Management of the PSDB.(b) Pramuka Bank Restructuring Committee.(c) A consortium of investors led by Asia Capital Ltd.(Asia Capital).

(XX)Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2003

Part llAccounts and operations of the centrar Bank of sri Lanka

The centrar Bank had discussions with the parties whofurnished proposals/concept papers. Having given dueconsideration to the above concept papers/proposals and therecommendations of Messrs. Ernst and young who wereappointed as the centrar Bank consurtants for this purpose, theMonetary Board decided that the only proposar that meritsfurther consideration was the one made by the consortium ledby IWs. Asia capital. It was noted, in particular, that this wasthe only proposal where a firm commrtment was made to infusecapital upfront to PSDB, which was considered as crucial. ifthe PSDB is to be rehabilitared.with regard to Asia capita|s proposar, the MonetaryBoard was of the opinion that despite certain concerns, and thefact that the implementation of the proposal involves thefulfilment of severar conditions precedent, the feasibility of the'proposal could not be completely ruled out. Thus the MlnetaryBoard decided to test its feasibility as against the only otheroption of liquidating the psDB. In forming this opinitn, rheMonetary Board also took cognisance of the fact that eventhough, as currently estimated, the depositors may finailyreceive around 60vo of the capital of deposits on a liquidation,there were other creditors such as those who have investedfunds in money market bills of the psDB who wourd not havequalified for any repayment in a liquidation, as they would notbe treated as depositors in a liquidation.Pending Asia Capital carrying out a due diligence tofinally determine whether they wourd undertake therestructuring of the psDB to enable it to continue to carry onbusiness, the Monetary Board decided that the psDB uepermitted to resume limited business with effec t from 22January 2004, in terms of Section 30(3) of the Monetary LawAct, subject to specified conditions. A further decision on thismatter is expected to be taken by 22 JuIy 2004 after AsiaCapital has completed the due diligence.

Financial Stability Committee

The Financial Stability Committee (FSC) which was established

in2002 was reconstituted in November 2003 to better represent

the departments of the Central Bank responsible for functions

relating to the financial system of the country. Consequent to

the Monetary Law (Amendment) Act, No. 32 of 2002 (certified

on 17 December, 2002), financial system stability is one of the

two objectives of the Central Bank. Therefore, the role of the

FSC is directly related to facilitating the Central Bank in the

discharge of its responsibilities and objectives. Accordingly, the

terms of reference of the FSC was decided as (i) Preparationof a Financial Stability Report (FSR) in the first year, and

thereafter half-yearly. The first repoft is to be completed by the

end of June, 2004. (ii) Assessing the risks and vulnerabilities

leading to major financial system instabilities in the country(iii) Monitoring financial system stability and (iv) submittingperiodic reports to the Govemor and the Monetary Board,

recommending policies necessary to promote financial system

stability. The FSC appointed a group consisting of 12 members

drawn from the relevant departments to conduct appropriate

research studies, prepare financial stability reports, make

necessary recommendations and function as the Committee's

Think Tank. As at the end of 2003, the outline for the first FSR

was finalised which was confined to an analysis primarily on

the sectors covered by institutions which are regulated and

supervised by the Central Bank on grounds that these sectors

contain all systemically important institutions. Considerable

progress was made in gathering necessary information for the

FSR. It was decided to set up a dedicated financial stability unitin the BSD. Also, technical assistance by way of services of

consultants from the IMF and Sveriges Riksbank (Central Bankof Sweden) were awaited to fully implement the financial

stability framework in Sri Lanka.

Pubtic Awareness of Financial Institutions

In 2003, the BSD issued the following press notices with a view

to increasing public awareness about interest rates and service

fees/charges of banks licensed by the Central Bank and the

institutions that are legally permitted to accept deposits from

the public.i. Publication of a one page paper advertisement on"A Gui^de to Interest Rates and Fees of Banks" tn all

major newspapers during the period 18 to 31 May 2003-

In this publication, the bank-wise information of lending

rates and deposit rates as at 28 April 2003 and levels of

fees and charges of the commercial banking sector as at

end of March, 2003 were published. The general public

was further informed of the spread between lending rates

and deposit rates prevailing in the country, advising themto negotiate with banks for better rates in a market

envlronment.

ii. Publication of a half-page press notice trtled "Instilutions

Legally Permitted to Accept Deposits from the Public"in all major newspapers during the period from Il to 22

December 2003. This publication was intended to assist

the general public to be vigilant in order to ensure the

safety of their deposits. While it contains a list of namesof banks and finance companies licensed by the CentralBank to accept deposits from the public, it did not

consti[ute a reconmendation to the public to deposit in anyone of the named institutions. The public was also

informed to make its own choice with regard to makinginvestments. However, the publication contained

guidelines that would assist the public in making a choice.

The above-mentioned publications are available on the Central

Bank's website.

Institutional Development in the BSDin 2003

Dunng the year 2003, the BSD received considerable resourcesfor the strengthenin-e of its operations through services of

staff strength was 65 when compared to 6l as at end of 2002'In June, 2003, the services of a resident Bank Supervision

Consultant were obtained initially for a period of 18 months

under the Central Bank Strengthening project funded by the

World Bank. The Consultant is primarily involved in upgrading

the on-site examination methodology with a risk-focus and

providing trainin-e to examination staff. The IMF also provided

the services of two consultants on three occasions for durationsof 3-6 weeks each to advise on improving of the internal

processes of the BSD. Meanwhile, the services of two officials

from the Financial Services Authority of Sweden were receivedfor one week under the SIDA Swedish Staff Exchange

Programme to provide training to the staff. In addition, the

Gurrency lssue

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka as the sole currency issuing

authority in Sri Lanka, continued to perform the function ofissuing legal tender currency for the use of domestic

notes and coins in circulation by the end of 2003 stood at

Rs.98,785 million, as against Rs.88,308 million at the end of

2002. This has been the highest ever recorded currency incirculation in the country. The continued high demand for

currency was due to enhanced transactions following the peace

process. Notes in circulation comprised 96.5 per cent of the

total cunency in circulation. The quantity of coins issued to

commercial banks during the year amounted to 103.4 millionpieces with a total value of Rs.264.4 million compared toprevious year's 76.1 mlllion pieces at a total value of Rs.251.6million. The quantity and value of coins issued to commercialbanks during the period 2000 - 2003 are given in Table II _ l.The central Bank issued two commemorative circulationcoins in the denomination of Rupees five to commemorate the250th anniversary of the Syamopali Maha Nikaya in sri Lankain July 2003. Upon rhe requests made by the Malwatte andAsgiriya chapters, the obverse of the coins were minted todepict the portraits of weliwita Sri Saranankara sangharajaMahimi and Pravara Upali Nahimi of Siam (Thailand)respectively. Both coins were minted in nickel brass and wasthe exact size and weight as the existing five rupee coin.Taking into consideration the attempts at counterfeitingcuffency notes, an enhanced security feature was introduced,in March 2003, namely a star wide security thread with a widthof 3 mm and 4 mm into Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 cunency notesrespectively. The Department also continued to work in closecooperation with the counterfeit Currency Bureau of thecriminal Investigation Department to contain and minimisecounterfeiting attempts. The number of counterfeit noresdetected in the country and referred for certification to the

Central Bank as required by the Monetary Law Act marginallydeclined from 1.8 notes per million notes in circuration in2002to 1.75 notes per million notes in circulation in 2003. Duringthe year the two currency verification counting and sortingmachines processed 135.9 million. serviceable andunserviceable notes.The Department continued to sell commemorative notesand coins to numismatists and collectors. Details of ailcorrmemorative notes and coins avarlable for sale at the centralBank together with their selling prices are given in Table II-2.Under the coin collecting program 10.0 million coins with aface value of Rs.53.0 million were collected by the departmentfrom places of religious worship etc. during 2003.The Cunency Department continued to conduct awarenessprograms on the identification of counterfeit notes and on theclean note policy for bank officers, school children, govemmentemployees and the general public, through public lectures andthe electronic media. Given the shortage of new notes in someparts of the country, the central Bank requested banks to collectunserviceable notes and send them for destruction and torecirculate new notes through their outstation branches.The Department also participated in the followingexhibitions organised by the Ministry of Industries.

Domestic Operations

The Domestic Operations Department continued to perform itsdual function of implementing the Bank's monetary policy,mainly through Open Market Operations (OMO) and

enforcement of Statutory Reserve Requirements (SRR), and of

serving as the banker to commercial banks and the government.In addition, the Department assumed the new responsibility ofproviding an intra day liquidity facility (ILF) to commercial

banks and primary dealers to ensure a smooth operation of theReal Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) introduced in

September, 2003. During the year, a system of active OMO was

introduced to enhance the effectiveness and market orientationof monetary policy operations, while the settlement of

transactions on a real time gross basis within an automated

general ledger system was introduced for banking operationsof the Deparlment.

1. Implementation of Monetary Policy

(i) Open Market Operations

A new system of OMO (see Box Article No. 20 of tlrc Centrol

Bank Annuol Report 2002), which enables the Central Bank to

actively manage market liquidity to achieve its monetary policytargets was introduced on 03 March 2003. The initial

experiences and challenges under this system of active OMO

are presented in Box 4 of this Annual Report. Under this

system, OMO included severaloperations: (a) conducting daily

auctions either for repurchase (Repo) transactions to absorbexcess liquidity, or reverse repurchase (reverse Repo)

transactions to inject liquidity, if there were a shortage ofliquidity, on a daily basis (b) provision of Repo and Reverse

Repo facilities under standing facilities and (c) outright salesof Treasury bills or purchases of both Treasury bills (in theprimary or secondary markets) and Treasury bonds (in the

secondaly market only), at the discretion of the Central Bank,

to absorb or inject liquidity on a long-term basis. As in the past,

only Treasury bills were used as collateral for repo transactions,

whrle both Treasury bills and bonds were used for reverse repotransactions. All commercial banks and primary dealerscontinued to be palticipating institutions (PIs) eligible to

participate in transactions under the OMO of the Central Bank.

In 2003, the market operated with a rupee liquidity surplusmainly due to the purchase of foreign exchange in the market

by the Central Bank and the net receipt of foreign loans by the

govemment. While a part of the excess liquidity was absorbed

on a long term basis through the operations of the Central Bankin the Treasury bill market on an outright basis and an issue of

Central Bank Securities, the balance was absorbed on a daily

basis through ovemight repo transacttons.

a. Repurchase (Repo) TransactionsO Under the Auctions System

Except for one day on which the market liquidity wasin balance, auctions for repurchase transactions were

conducted on every working day to absorb excessliquidity. The daily average repurchase auction value

offered to the market was Rs.5.5 billion. The auctions

were generally fully or over-subscribed, with the valueof bids received amounting to Rs.8.0 billion per day,

on average. The auction was under-subscribed only on

ten days (5 per cent of auctions). As the amount offeredto the market at the auction was on average about

Rs.3.7 billion less than the estimated liquidity surplus,

the average yield rate at the auctions remained closeto the Central Bank Repo rate.

(iil Under the Standing Facility SystemThe PIs which were not successful or did not

participate in auctions invested their excess funds in

Repos under the standing facility system. In addition,internally managed funds of the Central Bank too

invested their excess funds under the standin-e facility.While the maturity period of repo agreements with PI

was one day, intemal funds were allowed to invest inup to a maximum of seven day repos. Since theintroduction of the present system, on average repo

f acilities of Rs.3.6 billion per day under the standin-qtacility have been utilised fy PIs, while the amount

utilised by internally managed funds was Rs.2.8 billion(ovemight equivalent per day). Repurchase transactionsunder the standing facility were at the Repurchase rateof the Central Bank.

(iii) Total Volume

The total value of repurchase transactions, both underthe auction system and the standing facilities, inclusiveof investments by internally managed funds, more thandoubled from Rs,I,J64 billion in 2002 to Rs.4,331billion (overnight equivalent) in 2003, reflecring thecontinued excess liquidity in the market. The majorityof these transactions (78 per cent) was with pls.

(b) Reverse Repurchase (Reverse Repo)Transactions

As the market was liquid in 2003, there was no need for thecentral Bank to injecr liquidiry on a daily basis throughauctions. However, on a few occasions, reverse repo facilitiesunder standing facilities were utilised by a very few banks inApril and May, as they were unable to cover their entirerequirements in the inter bank market due to intemal limitsimposed by banks on lending to other banks. The total valueof government securities purchased under reverse repurchaseagreements in 2003 was Rs.ll billion, only 5 per cent of theamount purchased in2002. The main factor which contributedto this development was the action taken by the central Bankto ensure adequate liquidity in the market during the festiveseasons during which the market usually became short ofliquidity due to heavy seasonal demand for currency.(c) Outright Transactions in Government Securitieswith the introduction of the present system of oMo, the facilityfor discounting and re-discounting at the secondary window ofthe central Bank was replaced by outright sales and purchasesof Treasury bills at the discretion of the Centrar Bank to manaseliquidity on a longer-term basis.

During 2003, four weekly auctions were conducted to sellTreasury bills out of central Bank holdings on an outright basis.Treasury bills to a face value of Rs.l billion were offered ateach auction. However, except the first, the other auctions wereunder subscribed as there was a preference for marketparticipants to invest their excess funds on an ovemight basis.The total value of rreasury bills sold through these auctionswas Rs.1.7 billion. The weighted average yield rates at theseauctions were in the range of 7 .61per cent to 8.08 per cent andwere close to the comparable primary market Treasury bill yieldrates. In addition, Treasury bills to aface value of Rs.0.7 billionwere sold through direct dealing at prevailing market yield

rates.As the market was liquid, the Central Bank did notpurchase any government securities in the secondary market.However, in order to ensure adequate liquidity, particularlyduring the festive seasons, Treasury bills were purchased bythe Central Bank in the primary market. Total such purchasesof Treasury bills in the primary market in 2003 amounted toRs.49 billion, while Treasury bills to a face value of Rs.67billion matured during the yea

(d) Issue of Central Bank Securities

As there was a risk that the Central Bank holdings of Treasurybills might not be sufficient to absorb the excess liquidity,which continued to expand, Central Bank Securities to a facevalue of Rs.5.l billion was issued in September,2O03. Thesesecurities were issued without a coupon rate, on a discountbasis, at rates comparable with the prevailing primary marketyield rates for Treasury bills.

(e) Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR)

The SRR against deposit liabilities of commercial banks,denominated in Sri Lanka rupees, remained at l0 per centduring the year.With effect from 03 April 2003, the basis of computingSRR was changed from deposit liabilities and vault cashbalances at close of business on the preceding Wednesday ofthe reserve week, to the daily average balances of depositliabilities and vault cash during the week ending the precedingTuesday of the reserve week. This change was introducedmainly to improve the effectiveness of SRR.

(fl Bank Rate

The Central Bank's rate of interest (Bank Rate) on short term

advances to licensed commercial banks, stipulated underSection 87 of the Monetary Law Act, was reduced from l8 per

cent to l5 per cent per annum with eft'ect from 15 August 2003

to be in line with the general decline in the Bank's own policy

rates, viz;Repo rate and the Reverse Repo Rate.

2. Functions as the Banker to CommercialBanks and Government(i) Financial Institutions Accounts

Operating as the banker to banks, the Central Bank continued

to provide current account facilities to commercial banks andprimary dealers to ensure an efflcient inter bank payment andsettlemeht system. With effect from 8 September 2003, these

accounts were operated on a Real Time Gross Settlement basiswithin the automated general ledger system of the Bank.(ii) Government Accounts

As banker to the govemment, the Central Bank continued tomaintain accounts of government departments, govemment

agencies and institutions and ceftain statutory boards, providing

them with required banking facilities. The total number of such

accounts maintained by the bank stood at l2I as at end 2003,Four new accounts were opened in 2003, while two accountswere closed at the request of the government. In terms ofSection 89 of the Monetary Law Act, the Bank continued toprovide provisional advances to the government. The limit onsuch advances (10 per cent of the estimated governmentrevenue) was increased by Rs.1,600 million to Rs.32,912million in 2003. There was no interest charsed on these

advances.(iii) Import Duty Rebate to Exporters

The Bank reimbursed on behalf of the govemment, a total sumof Rs.65 million to commercial banks in 2003 in respect ofimport duty rebates paid by them to exporters as against a total

sum of Rs,304 million reimbursed in 2002. This service wastransferred to the Bank of Ceylon on the instructions of SriLanka Customs, with effect from 15 March 2003.

(iv) Subsidy and Ex-Gratia Payments to IndianRepatriates

The total subsidy payments made on behalf of the govemmentto repatriated estate workers of Indian ongin under the IndoCeylon Agreement of 1964 amounted to Rs.6l,90l in 2003against Rs.42,250 in 2002. Ex-gratia payments amounted toRs.3,300 in 2003, as in 2002,

3. Provision of Intra Day Liquidity Facility

The Department assumed the responsibility of providing intra

day liquidity to commercial banks and primary dealers, which

is essential for smooth and efficient operations of the RTGS

system established in Sn Lanka on 8 September 2003. The intraday liquidity facility (lLF) prevents payments being held upunnecessarily in queues without being settled on a real time

basis, thereby making the payment system more efficient. Funds

under ILF are provided free of interest by way of intra day

reverse repurchase transactions secured by eligible securities(government Treasury bills and bonds). Measures have beenin place to ensure the security of funds released under ILF andtheir return to the Central Bank before the end of the samebusiness day. Eligible securities are valued at their currentmarket prices adjusted by a sufficient 'hair cut' to coverpossible variations in price during the day. In case a PI fails to

settle in full the funds obtained under ILF before the end ofday, it is charged a default interest for the entire amount onthe first occasion at the Bank Rate and on each succeeding

occasion of default during a calendar year, such default interestwill be increased by 100 basis points. If such default occursmore than once in one month, the Central Bank has the rightto retain the securities a-qainst which ILF was granted and

charge the default interest.At the initial stage, drawings under the ILF by banks andprimary dealers were relatively high, on average around Rs.8.4billion per day in September, as the system was new and someparticipants obtained a relatively large amount as a

precautionary me asure. Gradually, wi th experience, parti cipants

reduced their ILF drawings to an average of Rs.3.2 billion per

day in December. The actual utilisation of ILF was even lower,around 35 per cent (Rs.l.l1 billion) of drawings on average inDecember 2003. The balance remained unutilised in theparticipant's RTGS Settlement Account at the Central Bank.As banks are allowed to utilise their balances under SRR forintra day settlement purposes, most banks managed to operatewithout ILF. There was only one occasion of an ILF defaultby a participant, but the penalty imposed promptly discardedit from repeating the same.ILF which is repayable during the day, (day light

advance), is considered neutral on the reserye money, and hence

on the monetary policy stance.

Employees' Provident Fund

The Employees' Provident Fund (EpF) ma.ked another yearof achievement in 2003. Superannuation Reforms, which are acomponent of the Financial sector Reforms agenda, progressedfurther towards its target of reinforcing old age security ttrougha sustainable market oriented mechanism. Reforming thesuperannuation system and developing the financial markets areinterdependent and should go together for the efficientfunctioning and sustainability of both segments. EpF, being thelargest superannuation scheme and the largest institutionalinvestor in Sri Lanka, was the focus of attention on the reformagenda.

The Monetary Board, as the custodian of EpF, continuedto discharge its responsibilities, in terms of the EpF Act, ofreceiving contributions, surcharges and income frominvestments, maintaining proper accounts of registeredemployments, members and the Fund, investing in suitablernvestments, and paying benefits to the members of the Fundwith the co-operation of the EpF Division of the Departmentof Labour.

System Modifications

system modifications introduced during 2003 enabled the Fundto improve its efficiency, cost effectiveness and accuracy.several modifications were done to the c3 collection systemin order to update regularly the database with new and existingemployer and employee details. The pc system that had beenused to handle the receipt of contributions electronically wasupgraded to the Fund's main AS/400 system during 2003. Theprovision of online auditing facilities to various audit unitsimproved the audit procedures. A module for entering chequereceipts at the collections counter was designed during thesecond half .of 2003. cheque imaging was used to keep trackof refunds made during the period 1992 to lggj, therebyavoiding any possible fraudulent reclaiming of EpF balances,Participation of EPF in RTGS

EPF was granted authorisation to open a settlement accountwith the central Bank to participate in the Real rime Gr,sssettlement System (RTGS) exclusively for investing andsecondary market trading in government securities, and also rouse a swlFT workstation for transmission of messages relatedto transactions of the system. As a result, EpF commencedoperations on RTGS in the fourth quarter of 2003 and was ableto cover inter bank payments involving large values andsettlement of government securities.

Public Awareness

Havin-q appreciated the need for a comprehensive publicawafeness programme in order to bring the Fund closer to allits stakeholders, several steps were initiated during the year.An important measure in this respect was the establishment of

a Help Desk in May 2003, in order to respond quickly to issuesraised by members. Member can raise queries at the Help Deskvia telephone, e-mail and fax and prompt replies are ensured.Further, EPF actively participated in the 'yuga Dekma -2003'industrial exhibition held in Embilipitiya and Matara to enhancepublic awareness. Thrs helped to reach members in remote areaseff'ectively and thereby gave them an opportunity to resolvetheir problems immediately. These awareness programmesfocus on introducing to all stakeholders of the Fund, their rightsand responsibilities pertaining to EPF, conect procedures to befollowed, and the significance of EpF for the members' well-being after retirement.The annual member statements for 2002 and the semiannual member statements for the first harf of 2003 were issuedto members through their employers during the year.

Strengthening of Fund ManagementCapacitiesA two-year comprehensive training programme in fundmanagement was instituted in November 2003. Twenty youngprofessionals were selected, after a rigorous selection process.The objective of this skills development is to strengthen EpFwith competent fund management professionars in order tofacilitate the ongoing restructuring activities in the fundmanagement of EPF. The sri Lanka Association of InvestmentProfessionals (SLAIP), a member of the USA-basedAssociation for Investment Management and Research (AIMR),which offers the world recognised chartered Financial Analyst(cFA) charter for professional fund managers, is recognised asthe facilitator and the trainer of this programme.

Management of Contributory pensionFund for Public ServantsA contributory Pension Fund (cpF) was esrablished by thegovernment to cover all the pensionable new recruits to thegovernment and the local government services with effect fromI January 2003. on a request made by the Ministry of Finance,the Monetary Board took over the custodianship and themanagement of CPF, while the Head of the pensionsDepartment has been charged with the responsibility for thesystem and process administration. The Monetary Board, dunng2003, commenced discharging these functions, tluough EpF.A separate unit has been established in EpF to manage CpF.An affbrdable and appropriate computerised system is beingacquired by EPF to ensure smooth operation of the cpF fromits outset.

Housing Loan Facilities

An EPF member is eligible to obtain a loan for housingpurposes from an approved lending institution, pledging themember's balance up to a maximum of 75 per cent of suchbalance. A second loan is also available upon the successful

settlement of the first. During2003, EPF issued 18,689 member

balance certifications for a total approved amount of Rs.2,791million to lending institutions.

Investment Activities and Returns

During the year, the total investment portfolio of the Fund grewby L3.2 per cent, recording a cost value of Rs.320 billion at

end 2003. Sustaining the last 5-year trend, the total investmentsin Treasury bonds - a long-term market oriented investment

instrument, expanded in 2003. For the first time, it surpassedthe total investments in Rupee securities - a long-termoff-market instrument, in the total investment portfolio. This

was in line with the EPF investment policy of diversifying its

investments with market oriented instruments. Thus, the

investment in Treasury bonds amounted to 56 per cent of the

total investment portfolio as at end 2003, as against 36 per centin 2002. Conespondingly, the share of investments in Rupee

securities continued to drop further from 6l per cent in2002

to 41 per cent at end 2003.

The period under review marked an improvement in the

performance of the listed equity portfolio of EPF. The bullrunin the equity market, which was stimulated by new investorconfidence generated by the peace initiative and conducive

macro economic conditions in the country, moved stock prices

to historically high levels during 2003. As a result, the listed

equity portfolio of EPF (Table II-3) generated a total retum of

Rs.845 million or a rate of retum of 69 per cent on its averageportfolio in 2003. Active participation by EPF in secondary

market trading of government securities in a downward moving

general interest rate structure enabled EPF to realise substantial

capital gains in 2003. The total capital gains of Rs.3,734 milhon

realised by EPF from its secondary market activities contributed

was the contributor to the increase in the realised rate of retum

on the total investment portfolio to 13.68 per cent in 2003 from

13.64 per cent in 2002. Although the overall general interest

rate structure in the country moved downward in 2002 and

2003, the high yielding long-term investment portfolio of EPF,

supported by high capital gains realised from listed equities and

repeal of the existing Exchange Control Act. This is intendedto transform the present regime of restricting and controllingforeign exchange to one of managing and regulating foreignexchange. The Bill for this legislation was published in theGovernment Gazette on 1910912003. It was subsequentlylisted in the Order Paper for presentation to Parliament on19lltl2003. Thereafter, the Bill was challenged in the SupremeCourt and the Court determined that certain amendments to theBill are required to make it consistent with the Constitution.These amendments are being attended to by the LegalDraftsman.During the year, measures to remove certain impedimentson current account transactions and to further liberalise capitalaccounl transactions, announced in the Budget for 2003, wereimplemented. These measures included permitting the clearanceby Sri Lanka Customs of all imports without referring toExchange Control, easing of restrictions on rupee lending toforeign controlled companies approved under Section l7 of theBOI Act, enhancing the period permitted for forward purchasesof foreign cunency for the purpose of repayment of loans,permrtting the import of goods on credit basis upto 360 daysat a reasonable rate of interest and the forward purchase offoreign currency for imports from a bank other than the bankhandling the import documents, permitting the conversion intofore ign currency of rupee proceeds of sale of assets mortgagedfor foreign currency loans on default of such loans, and easingrestriction on the issue of guarantees to non residents. Therepatriation out of sri Lanka of sale proceeds of real assetspurchased by non residents out of inward remittances of foreigncurrency brought into the country was also permitted. Inaddition, as a measure of extending the benefit of low interestrates on foreign currency loans to Sn Lankan workers employedabroad, banks were permitted to grant such workers foreigncurrency loans, to be released in rupees, to meet anyrequirement in Sri Lanka against the security of NRFC balancesof such workers, subject to specified terms and conditions.The Exchange Control Department also furtherstreamlined its monitoring activities, with the multipleobjectives of detecting transactions related to terrorism, incompliance with UN regulations, prevention of moneylaundering in terms of guidelines issued by the Financial ActionTask Force (FATF) and prevention of exchange malpractices.Activities relating to the investigation into contraventions ofthe Exchange control Act, registration of freight forwarders andgranting and renewing of permits of travel agents, moneychangers And other persons and entities permitted to acceptforei_qn currency also continued during the year. Thesupervision and monitoring of activities of money changerswere also further strengthened during the year.

1. The Foreign Exchange Management Act

The repeal of the present Exchange Control Act and replacingit with new legislation titled "Foreign Exchange Management

yielding a real effective rate of 5.77 per cent over the inflationof 6.3 per cent measured by CCpI.

Exchange Gontrol

The year 2003, saw several major developments in the area ofExchange Control Reform. The most significant was theprogress made to introduce new legislation titled the "ForeignExchange Management Act" (FEMA) which provides for the

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2OO3(xxIX)

Part llAccounts and Operations of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Act" was recommended to the Government by the FinancialSector Reforms Committee (FSRC) with the approval of theMonetary Board, based on recommendations of a Task Forceappointed by the FSRC to examine Exchange ControlRegulations with a view to relaxing them in order to maketransactions easier and smoother. Although, even at present, itis possible to further liberalise Capital Account Transactionsby issuing directions and granting general permission under theprovisions of the existing Exchange Control Act, the enactmentof new legislation was recommended due to under-mentioned

reasons:(r) To create confidence on the irreversibility andsusrainability of liberalisation of current and capital

transactions by making provisions in the legislation itself.(ii) The obsolete structure of the present Exchange ControlAct in the context of recent developments in the financialsector and changes taking place in the foreign exchangeregimes in neighbouring countries; exchange control/management laws in most countries are in terms ofmovement of foreign exchange in and out of the countryon the basis of cunent and capital transactions, rather thanin terms of specific transactions between residents and non

residents.(iii) The criminal nature of violations of the provisions of the

present Act which could attract severe penalties includingmandatory imprisonment being an inhibiting factor forforeign investor activities and other business activitiesinvolving foreign exchange transactions, due to fear ofattracting such penalties on the part of participants ininvestment and business activities.

The proposed FEMA, which was finalised by a Committeein the Ministry of Finance, seeks to remove the restrictive andprohibitive provisions of the existing Act and provide for theorderly management and regulation of outflows and inflows offoreign exchange in terms of current and capital transactionsin a more liberal environment, rather than imposing rigidrestrictions. This is expected to encourage the inflow of foreigncapital for investment and create a more conducive environmentfor business activity. The proposed Act is expected to be

enacted during the course of 2004.

2. Capital Transactions(a) Non-Resident Investment in Sri Lanka

During the year 2003, no changes were effected with respectto Exchange Control regulations relating to investment in SriLanka by non residents.

(b) Investment Abroad by Sri Lankan Residents

During the year 2003, 12 approvals were granted by theHon. Minister of Finance for investment abroad by residentcompanies and the total value of such investments was

US dollars 29.2 mn. The areas in which such investments were

permitted included export promotion, financial services andtravel services. In addition, two companies which were

subsidiaries of foreign companies were permitted to participatein stock purchase plans of their parent companies.

(c) Rupee Lending to Non-resident ControlledCompanies

In 2003, in terms of a Budget decision, to remove disparity

between BOI companies fully exempted from exchange control

and other foreign controlled companies, prudential limits thathad hitherto been applicable relating to the quantum of rupeelending by banks to non resident controlled BOI companieswere removed.

(d) Foreign Currency Borrowings by Residents

At present, authorised dealers are permitted to extend foreigncurrency loans to direct exporters and to specified indirectexporters. The NDB and DFCC are also permitted to extendforeign cuffency loans to exporters, provided that they have

resources from foreign currency credit lines to do so. Hitherto,in the case of default of foreign currency loans secured by

mortgage of domestic assets, authorised dealers were requiredto apply to the Controller of Exchange for permission to convertthe rupee sale proceeds of such assets into foreign exchange.However, with effect from 2l January 2003, commercial banks

were permitted to convert into foreign currency rupee proceedsrealised from the sale of assets mortgaged in respect ofdefaulted foreign curency loans, without reference to ExchangeControl Department, provided that the bank retains with themsatisfactory evidence to the effect that a proper assessment was

made of the credit risk when granting the loan and that effortsmade to sell the mortgaged assets for foreign cunency hadfailed. With effect from December 2003. as a measure ofenhancing facilities available to Sri Lankans employed abroad,permission was granted to commercial banks to extend foreigncurrency loans to such workers for utilisation for any purposein Sri Lanka, against the security of their Non Resident ForeignCunency Account (NRFC) balances, subject to certain termsand conditions, which included the requirement that the loanbe released in rupees and the repayment be made in foreigncurrency. During the year, approval was granted to the DFCCBank to participate in two syndicated loans to be granted totwo BOI companies set up to generate electricity and for theSri Lanka Insurance Corporation also to participate in thesyndicated loan to one of them.

(e) Borrowing from Abroad by Resident Companies

Bonowing abroad by resident companies, other than companies

approved under Section 17 of the BOI Act with full exemptionfrom the provisions of the Exchange Control Act (Section 17BOI companies), require the prior approval of the ExchangeControl Department (ECD). During the year under review, twocompanies were permitted to borrow from abroad to a totalextent of US dollars 4.08 mn.

(f) Forward contracts in Foreign Currency forsettlement of loans

In terms of anorher budget decision implemented in 2003, theperiod for which forward contracts could be entered into fbrpurchase of foreign currency from a bank for settlement ofloans has been increased from 360 days to 120 days, subjectto production of evidence regarding the commitment to repaythe loan to the bank entering the selling contract.(g) Issue of Bank Guarantees in favour of NonResidentswith the implementation of the decision contained in theBudget for 2003 for turther liberalising the issue and renewalof guarantees on zl January 2003, commercial banks arepermitted to issue and renew guarantees in respect ofobligations undefiaken by residents in Sn Lanka which involvea payment in foreign exchange to non residents for the undermentioned purposes without reference to Exchange control:(r) Bid Bonds in favour of non residents without a limit inrespect of exports and service contracts, subject toconditions stipulated in the tender or quotation.(ii) Performance Bonds in favour of non residents without alimit in respect of exports or service contracts subject toproof of the award of the contract, and conditronsstipulated in the contract.(iil vour ofno

Prior to this liberalisation, the issue of bid bonds andperformance bonds over 5 per cent and l0 per cent respectivelyof the value of a tender, and letters of guarantee in favour ofnon residents exceeding Rs.200,000, required the prior approvalof the Controller of Exchange on a case by case basis-(h) Blocked Funds held by Sri Lankan Emigrantsand Foreign Nationals

blocked accounts were permittedbject ro a limit of Rs.750,000 perfamily unit. Accordingly, during

the year, a sum of Rs.95.98 mn. had been remitted abroad inrespect of 277 applications received from migrants leaving thecountry, Further, funds to the extent of Rs.23.24 mn. realisedby the sale of immovable property belonging to Sri Lankanemrgrants were remitted out during the year. The latter categoryalso included cases where sale proceeds were claimed by nonresident heirs of deceased owners,(i) Repatriation of Sale proceeds of propertiesOwned by Non-Residents

The budget decision to permit persons to make payment of thepurchase price of a residential property owned by a non-residentor his non-resident heirs, provided that the property had beeninitially purchased or developed by such non-resident out ofinward remittances in foreign currency was implemented.Repatriation of such sale proceeds through authorised dealersupto the value of inward remittances brought in to purchaseand/or develop the property was also permitted. However, anybalance funds after the remittance of the permissible sum hadto be kept in a blocked account in the name of the non-residentseller. Ttus decision was implemented by the issue of a Noticeunder the Exchange Control Act published in the GazetteNotification No: l3l2l9 of 28 October 2003.3. Trade TransactionsIn the area of international trade transactions, a majordevelopment was the amendment of the Regulations madeunder the Import and Export (control) Act published in theGazetteNo- 102216 of 8 April 1998 in respect of payment termsfor imports. The amendment was effected by regulations madeunder the same Act published in the Gazette No. r2llll2 of27 February 2003 empowering sri Lanka customs to releaseimports which do not fall within payment terms stipulated inthe earlier regulations without referring to the Controller ofExchange. These included imports on "no foreign exchangeinvolved basis" over US dollars 1,000 received as gifts, tradesamples, and equipment and machinery sent by foreigninvestors for their projects in Sri Lanka. This was introducedas a measure of removing existing restrictions on currenftransactions. The maximum period granted for the import ofgoods on advance payment terms was also enhanced fromI month to 3 months by a Regulation published in the GazetteNo. l3l9l28 of l8 December 2003. However, Exchangecontrol continues to monitor import of goods for whichpayment has been made in advance to ensure the anival ofgoods. Two other budget decisions also aimed at providingfufiher facilities for trade transactions were implemented witheff'ect from2r January 2003. one was to permit importers topurchase foreign currency on a forward contract from a bankother than the bank establishing documentary credits forimports and collecting import bills on documents againstacceptance (D/A) terms or against Documents against payments(D/P) terms. Hitherto, such fbrward purchases were permitted

only from the bank handling the import documents. The other

was to pernut commercial banks to allow the import of goods

on credit terms upto 360 days, provided that the interest charged

is reasonable, Prior to implementation of the latter decision, the

approval of the Controller of Exchange had to be obtained to

pay interest on supplier's credit facilitles.

4. Registration of Freight Forwarders and

Issue of Permits to Engage inForeign Exchange Transactions

ECD continued to register Freight Forwarders, grant Travel

Agencies the authority to issue Travellers Cheques and issue/

renew licenses of Money changers and other establishments

such as hotels, duty free shops, travel agents and service

providers to accept foreign currency with respect to sales and

services performed by them to tourists.

(a) Registration of Freight Forwarders

During the year 2003,9 new companies were registered as

freight forwarders, bringing the total number of companies

registered as freight forwarders to 126 at the end of the year.

The ECD continued to monitor the activities of registered

Freight Forwarders.

(b) Authority for Travel Agents to issue Travellers'

Cheques

During the year 2003, one more Travel Agent, N Car Travels

and Tours Ltd., was granted authority to issue travellers'

cheques bringing the total number of Travel Agents so

authorised to 9.

(c) Appointment of Money Changers and their

supervision

In 2003, the ECD issued perrruts to 3 companies to engage in

the business of money changing, while the permits of 37 Money

Changers were renewed, bringing the total number of

authorised Money Changers to 40. As a result of requiring a

minimum turnover of US dollars 5,000 per month and the

regular inspections carried out on Money Changers, a growth

in tumover of the Money Changing business has been recorded

in the year 2003. The annual turnover of Money changers

increased from us dollars 155.0 mn in 2002 to US dollars

170.2 mn in 2003, representing an increase of 9.0 per cent over

the previous year.

5. Monitoring

With the liberalisation of current account transactions in 1994,

Authorised Dealers (ADD) and approved Travel Agents were

permitted to release foreign exchange without any restrictions

for current account transactions, exercising their jud-eement and

discretion after satisfying themselves with the bona-fides of the

requests.

All ADD and approved travel agents are required to report

to ECD sales and purchases of foreign exchange on a regular

basis to enable ECD to monitor such transactions. From 1999,

ADDs were also required to report releases of foreign exchange

through Electronic Fund Transfer Cards (EFTCs). At present,

ADDs provide detailed monthly reports on EFTCs where the

monthly drawings in foreign exchange exceeds US dollars

5,000 per card.Monitoring activities on the sales and purchases of foreign

exchange were pursued with greater intensity with emphasis

being placed on detecting un-authorised capital transfers as well

as remittances which may be associated with financing of

tenorist activities or money laundering activities. During the

year, ECD took steps to encourage banks on

on the sales and purchases of foreign cu ly,

using software developed by the Information Technology

Department of the Central Bank which has now been installed

in head offices of all commercial banks. At present, information

in respect of sales of foreign exchange for travel exceeding

US dollars 5,000 are submitted electronically by the head

offices of banks. Once the submission of data electronically is

expanded to cover branch offices, monitoring activities cOuld

be speeded up and used more effectively for early identification

of trends in the inflow and outflow of foreign exchange, whrle

the system would also serve as an effective early warning

mechanism on the financial stability situation and any

impending foreign exchange crises e/c.

Although Anti Money Laundering legislation has not yet

been passed in Sri Lanka, all commercial banks have been

requested to follow the 40 recommendations of the Financial

Action Task Force (FATF) for prevention of money laundering.

Due to the diligence exercised by the ECD and the banks,

attempts to use the banking system to commit financial frauds

have been thwarted. Further, in one instance where the sourceof funds remitted to Sri Lanka in respect of an advanced

payment was suspected to have originated from a financial

fraud, steps were taken to prevent the persons involved from

withdrawing such funds from the banking system'

During this year too, the ECD issued several Operating

Instructions to commercial banks, specialised banks, money

changers, travel agents authorised to issue Travellers' Cheques(TCs), and other persons and entities authorised to accept

foreign currency, attention to

diligently complY issued bY the

Foreign Affairs in t ulations No' I

ECD's Operating Instructions in this regard, and also requesting

information in respect of attempts made to open accounts or

undertake transactions by persons or entities which bear any

connection to the list of persons and entities designated as

persons and entities to which the above regulations apply. In

several instances where there was a suspicion that inward

foreign exchange remittances were linked to such persons and

entities, steps were taken to prevent the release of such funds

pending a thorough investigation of the source of theremlttance.

ECD continued to monitor payments made in advance forimports in order to ensure the receipts of goods and servicesinto the country against such advance payments. Credits anddebits made to rupee accounts maintained'by shipping andairline agents as well as freight forwarders on behalf of foreignprincipals/agents continued to be monitored during the year.

6. Investigation

The ECD continued with investigations on alleged violationsof the Exchange Control Act. Investigations into a total of 42cases were concluded and penalties were imposed in respectof 6 cases, and a further 5 cases were identifled for impositionof penalties. In addition, penalties were imposed in respect ofanother 3 cases where exchange control violations weredetected and the parties admitted the violations. Total penaltiesimposed in respect of all these cases during the year was Rs,2.4mn. A significant development in the area of investigations wasthe filing of indictments by the Attorney General's Departmenton investigations concluded by ECD against persons involvedin a massive Exchange Control fraud. The total value of foreignexchange involved in the fraud is estimated at Rs.1,331 mn.Representatives of the ECD participated in theIndo-Lanka Bilateral talks on Customs procedures and briefedthe Indian Customs Authorities of the progress made ininvestigations related to cases of alternative remittance agentactivities in Sri Lanka refened to the central Bank bv the IndianCustoms Authorities.

electronic publications such as Recent Additions (New books

received by LIC), Current Contents, Selected Articles, Central

Banking Around the World, News Alert and disseminated them

to library users via intranet.The services extended by LIC were improved by

streamlining the book circulation through measures such as

introduction of Library guide lines, registration of Library users,

imposition of Library fines and completion of bar-coding of the

entire book collection. As a result the book circulation increased

distinctly from July onwards.The membership of Economics and Banking Library

Network (ebanklibnetsl), which was initiated by LIC tn2002,

has increased its membership from l7 to23, institutions' LIC

Information Technology

The Central Bank, following the intemational best practices,

took action to upgrade the national payment system to reduce

any systemic risk and effect faster settlement of transactions

among the major players in the financial market: commercial

banks, primary dealers and selected institutional investors,' This

involved the installation of 3 state of the art advanced systems,

viz, a Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System' Scripless

Secunties Settlement System (SSSS) and an automated GeneralLedger System (GLS) for the Central Bank. Theimplementation of all 3 systems was assigned to the

Information Technology Department (lTD). These are the key

projects involving technological improvements under the

Central Bank Modernisation Project funded by the World Bank.

The implementation of RTGS on 8 September 2003, and

the installation of the SSSS to proceed for live implementationin February 2004, have made a substantial leap in the use ofInformation Technology (lT) in the national payments

infrastructure, making Sri Lanka the frrst country in the region

to operate a payment system equipped with the state of the art

technology. ITD played a proactive role in critical areas of theproject such as project management from planning to

implementation stages, transferring the technical knowledge to

commercial banks and primary dealers, preparation of the IT

infrastructure, oversight of software testing for compliance of

functionality with the business and technical requirements

specified in the bid document and managing the migration

process into the live environment- To further modernise the

payment system, work is being initiated by the Central Bankto introduce Cheque Imaging and Truncation (CIT) to the

country's cheque clearing system with the long term objectiveof moving towards an electronic cheque' ITD, which is

expected to play a leading role in this project as well, provided

technical inputs in conceptualsing the CIT concept and the data

communication methodologY.ITD continued its efforts in uplifting the IT infrastructureof the Central Bank as well as the IT knowledge. During the

year a significant expansion of IT use in the Bank was achieved,

due to implementation of several IT systems; RTGS, Integrated

General Ledger, Treasury Dealing Room Management for

international operations, computerised system to conduct active

open market operations. These systems provide facilities for an

on-line data entry, transaction processing in real time and

convenient access to information. Cunently, the day to dayfunctions of the Central Bank are mostly IT enabled.

Altogether, 700 networked personal computers are provided to

the desktop of officers to discharge their functions in an IT

enabled-environment, with an emphasis on taking decisions

based on timely information and analysis.

The e-mail facility, which was earlier limited to all staff

oftlcers, was extended to cover non-staff officers as well. The

Internet connections to the desktops of staff officers was

expanded, to facilitate access to information to a wider group

and to promote self-learning as part of human resources

development. To accommodate the increased e-mail and

Internet traffic, the leased line capacity providing intemet/e-

mail connectivity was expanded to 256 Kbps. The 'self-service'

concept in accessing information by officers is adopted with

the introduction of Central Bank Information Service where

individual departmen ts place information on websites access ible

for internal staff only. A website for the Welfare Department

was developed by ITD, which was implemented on29 October

2003. Cunently, departmental websites are active in Economic

Research, Statistics, Information Technology, Training,

Information and Welfare. These developments have led to a

gradual displacement of the paper based working environment,

which is considered as conducive fbr a modern Central Bank.

Software Development projects

ITD continued to develop several AS/400 based as weil as pcbased applications for the user departments of the Bank. Theseprojects were undeftaken as a means of replacing most of themanual processes and as interfaces to RTGS System, SSSSystem and the automated GL System.A project undertaken to computerise the functions of theCurrency Department dunng the previous year continued in2003, and the software deveropment for ail divisions of theCurrency Department, namely, the Deposits, Main Vault, Issuevault, cunency counting and venfication Division have beencompleted. The testing of the software for compliance with userspecification is in progress. The implementation of the in-housedeveloped computerised system is expected to read to further

committee and has assisted by providing statistics and otherrequired information to the committee. ITD also continuedproviding infbrmation to Labour Department and other relatedinstitutions on EPF matters. These facilities were provided byITD in addition to the overail maintenance of the EpF computerinstallation.

Expansion of IT infrastructureIT infrastructure had to be extensively expanded to facilitatethe implemenration of RTGS, ssss and the automated GLS.It became necessary to install the SWIFT software at cBSL toenable the receipt of transaction related swlFr messages sentby participant banks and primary dealers and to transmit themto RTGS/sSS system for processing. The swIFT sofrwareoperating platform which was earlier on windows NT wasmrgrated to the UNIX platform to be compatible with RTGS/ssss operating platform. All participants were configured toa SWIFT Close User Group for the secure transmission ofSWIFT messages ro RTGS/SSS systems.Some of the infrastructure development work compretedprior to the implementation of RTGS/sSSS are as follows:i. Leased line connectivity from Head office to the backupsrte was upgraded to 2MBpS.ii. completed laying of a backup fibre optic backbone at thehead office.iii. Installation of fire protection equipment at the serverrooms.iv. Increased the Ups capacities at the main site as well asthe backup site.v. Expansion of froor capacity at the backup site toconrmence operations during a disaster.vi. Installation of an auditable access control facility at thebackup site.

with the expansion of the computer network the need forIT resources increased considerably and it was evident that theavailability of IT resources had to be maximised. A help deskwas established in ITD to log all user problems. several trainingsessions were held for departmental IT liaison officers so thatthey are equipped to handle most of the IT related issues intheir own departments. with a view of increasing the ITawareness of Central Bank officers, staff of ITD was releasedto conduct lectures and training sessions at the centre forBanking studies.

Implementation of RTGS / SSS systems

The RTGS and SSSS projects were underraken by CBSL, toautomate the payments and settlement system and the Securitiessettlement System of sri Lanka to achieve the following:. Reduce settlement risk in the payment system andsecurities system in line with emerging best internationalpractrce

(b) Major Administrative Measures TakenDuring 2003

The Foreign Reserve Mana-eement Committee (FRMC), a sub-

committee charged with the function of management of foreign

reserves, continued to set policy and the overall strategy, while

reviewing the existing procedures, guidelines, responsibilities,

portfolio setting and risk management. It also adopted the

policies and procedures as required for efficient reserve

management and risk management. Meanwhile, the Market

operations committee (MOC), another sub-committee

attending to day to day monetary and exchange rate policy met

daily and continued to adopt daily investment and market

intervention strategies. The Treasury Operations Committee

which was set up in 2003, discussed the operational issues with

regard to dealing, settlement and book keeping as and when

they arose.CBSL decided to reclassify its fixed income securitiesportfolio inro available-for-sale (AFS) and trading (TRD)

categories in line with best intemational practices in 2003 and

to support international accounting standards (IAS). It was also

AecijeO that, while adopting mark-to-market accounting for

profit determination as per IAS, IOD should report operating

profits to the management according to the weighted average

cost basis as well.During 2003,IOD revised the existing guidelines on

reserve management and completed the automation of dealing

activities. The former involved two important tasks, (i) the

complete revision of reserve management guidelines that were

prepared in 1995 and (li) setting up of an advanced countetparty

credit risk management system (CCRMS). The latter involved

the development of a treasury module by a local firm according

to IOD's requirements and specifications and launching of the

system by 2 January 2004. These measures enabled the Bank

to strengthen dealer supervision, reduce risks in its forei-qn

reserve management operattons and enabled on-line measuring

and monitoring of risks with improved efficiency in reserve

management.(c) Operating Instructions, Circulars andDirections Issued During 2003

(i) Limits of Daity Foreign Currency Working

Balances

The limits on daily net foreign exchange open positions (NOP)

of commercial banks were established as a prudential measure

immediately prior to the introduction of the floating exchange

rate regime in January 2001. At the time of its introduction in

January 2001, this limit was imposed fbr each commercial bank

at 10 per cent of its DBU capital inclusive of reserves, in respect

of positive (overbought) net foreign exchange open positions

and thereafter revised to l5 per cent in March 2002'

The objective of setting limits was to contain any adverse

in the foreign exchange

urrency. Given the stabi

2003 and the necessitYof increasing dePth and

decided to raise the limit from l5 per cent of DBU capital to a

maximum of 20 per cent of consolidated capital funds

depending on the capitalfrom I September 2003'

used as the base for th

requirements for capital adequacy were revised from DBU

capital to consolidated capital (DBU and FCBU) in January

2003.The limits on oversold (negative) exposure postttons were

left to be set internally by the management of the banks. Since

the capital balances of the banks change over time, the limits

will be revised annually on the basis of the audited financial

statements.(ii) Amendments to the Weekly Report on

Commercial Bank on Foreign CurrencyDeposit Liabilities

CBSL issues a schedule of exchange rates, weekly to

commercial banks for the purpose of converting their foreign

currency deposit liabilities into US dollars and for reporting

such balances to CBSL. This schedule included some of the

Euro area legacy curencies as well. As the Euro area legacy

currencies ceased to be legal tender since March 2002, those

currencies namely, the Belgium Franc, Deutsche Mark, French

Franc, Italian Lira and the Netherland Guilder were removed

Public Debt

The year 2003 witnessed many a landmark achievement in thesphere of public debt management and debt marketdevelopment. Measured in terms of key indicators such as debt

progfarnme, early retirement of high cost callable Rupee loans,strengthening the institutionar, legal and market framework foriss'e and trading of scripless securities, introduction of a screenbased trading platform for government bonds, adoption of acode of conduct for primary Dearers (pDs) and initiativestaken in regard to a sovereign rating were noteworthy stepstaken in this regard.

function of debt management, which stipulates that ,the centralBank shall, as agent of the government, be responsibre fbr themanagement of the pubric debt'. In Sri Lanka, the raising ofdebt by the government requires the scrutiny by the MonetaryBoard as per the Section rr4 of MLA, which states that .no

new loan shall be raised and no new issue of stock or debentureshall be made by the government or by any agency or anyinstitution referred to in subsection (l) of section 106, whetherln pursuance written law orotherwise, unl Board has firstbeen obtained

roan or issue, f the ProPosed

The annual Appropriation Act authorises the raising ofloans "in or outside" sri Lanka, on behalf of the gou.*n,.nt,

Deposit Act (TCDA) and rax Reserve cerrificares Acr(TRCA). SLDBs, which are considered as domestic debt, areissued in terms of the Foreign Loans Act. During the last f'ewyears, no TCDs or rRCs were issued by pDD. pDD servicesboth domestic and forei-qn clebt. In addition to pDD, theTreasury also raises public debt. Foreign debt is raised by theTreasury through the External Resources Department.

The main objective of pDD is to manage the public debtto ensure that the govemment's financing needs and its paymentobligations are met at the lowest possible cost over the mediumto long term, consistent with a prudent degree of risk. TheDomestic Debt Management Committee (DDMC), asub-committee set up for this purpose, meets monthly, or morefrequently if necessary to decide on the borrowing progranmein the immediate future, while meeting cash flow requirementof the Treasury and maintaining the budgetary limrts. A closecoordination between the State Accounts Department of theTreasury and PDD is maintained to ensure an efflcientmanagement of the government's cash flow and public debt.

Developments in 2003

Debt fssuance and CostIn terms of the Appropriation Act, No. 31 of 2002 approvedby Parliament for 2003, the total gross borrowing limirof thegovernment amounted to Rs.316 billion. This limit wasenhanced to Rs.375.7 billion by the end of 2003, mainry roaccommodate the early retirement of callable Rupee loans,which amounted to Rs.33.4 billion. pDD followed awell-planned borrowing programme and an appropriate mrx ofshort and long term instruments, among other things, to lowerthe cost of bo'owing in 2003. This effort was facilitated byfavourable macroeconomic conditions such as low inflationexpectations and low interest rates that prevailed since thesecond half of 2002.The total outstanding public debt as at end of 2003amounted to Rs.1,933.4 billion. As shown in Table II-14, theshare of non-tradable debt such as Rupee loans declinedsharply, as a result of a conscious effort made to improve thetradability of debt instruments and competitiveness of themarket, consequently, increased public debt was representedby Treasury bills and Treasury bonds and by end 2003

outstanding public debt covering these two insl.ruments

amounted to Rs.219.3 billion and Rs.487.5 billion, respectively.

This was an increase of Rs.8.3 billion and Rs.140.4 billion

respectively, as compared with that of the previous year' The

composition of total debt reflected an increase in the share of

foreign debt. Consequently, the share of domestic debt in total

public debt declined from 56 per cent in 2002 to 54 per cent

in 2003, while that of foreign debt increased fiom 44 per cent

to 46 per cent. However, the dOmestic market continued to

remain the main Source of government bonowin-e accounting

for more than three fourth of the total borrowing in 2003'

Table II-15 show that, in conformity with prudent debt

management policies, net new issues of debt were made

through tradable instruments such as Treasury bills and

Treasury bonds. Accordingly, the existing debt on non-tradable

instruments such as Rupee loans in 2003 was reduced and this

included a net repayment of Rupee loans amounting to Rs.39.3

billion. In 2003, one strategy adopted in debt management was

to issue more medium to long-term Treasury bonds and to

To give effect to a budget proposal for 2003 of reducing

the interest cost of the existing debt, PDD took steps to retire

callable Rupee loans amounting to Rs.33,4 billion, which

carried interest rates of 13 per cent and above. Funds required

to retire these Rupee loans were raised mainly by issuing

Treasury bonds and total interest savings for the government

Infrastructure Development and TechnicalAssistance

In2003, several pioneering steps were taken by pDD to furtherdevelop the govemment debt securities market. These initiativesincluded the work relating to the installation of the proposedScripless Securities Settlement System (SSSS) and CentralDepository System (CDS) for Treasury bills and Treasurybonds, conducting seminars, workshops and public awarenessprogrammes on government debt securities market, adoptionof a Code of Conduct for PDs, introducing the Bloombergtrading platform, initiating the process to obtain a sovereigncredit rating and developing a long term yield curve. Steps werealso taken to strengthen the regulatory framework for pDs.

Scripless Securities Settlement System (SSSS)and the Central Depository System (CDS)

PDD continued to work on the completion of the instailationof SSSS and CDS during 2003. As a result of this innovation,Treasury bills and rreasury bonds that are hitherto issued inthe form of paper certificates will be issued in scripless form.ssss will improve efficiency in the government debt securitiesmarket by enhancing secondary market trading and eliminatingthe risks associated with paper based securities. Since SSSSoperates electronically, on-line trading willbe convenient to allmarket participants. The funds transfer underlying the securitiestransactions are based on a Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)System through which payments will be effectedinstantaneously on a real time basis.An important component of the proposed SSSS will be acDS for govemment securities. cDS is an electronic database,which will record the holdings of govemment securities. cDSwiil perform as the registry as well as the custodian forgovernment securities. SSSS and CDS rogether will be named'LankaSecure'.With the proposed insrallarion of SSSS and CDS in early2004, PDD will have to manage the transition from scripsecurities to scripless securities. Necessary amendments to therelevant legislations to enable the issue and trading of scriplesssecurities as well as dematerialisation of the existing scripsecurities were enacted in 2003.

Seminars and Workshops

During the last few years the government debt securities marKethas grown in many respects. New financial instrumenBincluding derivatives such as interest rate swaps and forwardrate agreements and international best practices based on stateof the art technolo-qy have been introduced. In the light of thesddevelopments, it was considered important to develop the skillsof the CBSL officers and staff of market participants.Accordingf y, rn 2003, CBSL jointly with the Association ofPrimary Dealers organised two workshops on fixed income

securities in association with Euromoney Institute of the UnitedKingdom.PDD conducted a series of seminars for PDs and other

stakeholders of the debt market to finalise the Code of Conductfor PDs. PDD also conducted several public awarenessprogrammes on the proposed SSSS with assistance from PDs.

Code of Conduct for Primary Dealers

The 'Code of Conduct for Primary Dealers' issued in July 2003

has set out guidelines, among other things, on the best practicesin areas such as personal dealing by directors and employees

of PDs, confidentiality, honesty and fairness, diligence, conflictof interest. The Code came into effect from I September 2003.Compliance officers were appointed in PD companies andlicensed commercial banks operating pnmary dealer units toreport on the compliance with the provisions of the Code.

Risk Based Capital Adequacy forPrimary Dealers

Under the World Bank technical assistance programme,initiatives were taken to develop a risk sensitive capital

adequacy framework to promote the financial soundness of PDs

and to protect the stability of the financial system. The proposedrisk based capital adequacy framework will replace the

comprehensive approach to risk assessment of PDs used byPDD at present.

Bloomberg Bond Trading System

PDD took the initiative to introduce the Bloomberg BondTrading System for the PDs in order to provide basic market

infrastructure necessary for trading in government securities.This system will provide real time trading in government

securities, resulting in a reduction in trade execution time andtransaction cost as well as increased trading volumes andliquidity. Since this system displays firm and competitivetwo-way quotes from PDs, margins (spreads) between buyingand selling prices will be thinner and this will facilitate

transparent and efficient price discovery. This system will bedirectly interfaced with RTGS and SSSS being operated by theCentral Bank.

Sovereign Credit Rating for Sri Lanka

CBSL, on behalf of the government, initiated the process toobtain a sovereign credit rating for Sri Lanka in order toestablish a benchmark in the international capital market.Sovereign credit rating is an independent assessment of agovernment's creditworthiness, As an initial step, investmentbanks operating in Sri Lanka with credit rating advisoryservices were requested to make proposals to consider

appointment of a ratin-e advisor. The rating advisor will assistthe government in the rating process to obtain a rating from

one or more other intemational rating agencies.

Regulation and Supervision of thePrimary Dealer System

The existing PD system, which was established in March 2000,was expanded in 2002. To enable this expansion, theregulations issued under the LTBO and RSSO were amendedpermitting LCBs to apply to be appointed as PDs. The

expansion was brought about to promote a greater competition

among PDs and infuse a higher liquidity into the market. There

were eleven PDs operating by the end of 2ffi3 and this included

eight PD companies and three LCBs.Directions were issued under LTBO and RSSO in 2003to strengthen the framework for the supervision of PDs,particularly with respect to capital requirements and to widenthe areas in which prudential requirements such as fiduciaryresponsibilities and custodial arrangements, standards of

competence for the board of directors and senior management,risk management systems and infrastructure can be specified

and enforced.Directions issued to PDs were on minimum capital

requirement, Forward Rate Agreements (FRA) and interest rate

swaps (lRS), firm two way quotes (bid and offer pnces) forbenchmark maturities, Special Risk Reserves, Custodial &

Trust Holdings of Scrip Securities, minimum subscription levelsfor Treasury Bill and Treasury Bond Auctions and accountingfor Repo transactions. In terms of the direction on minimum

capital requirement, PDs are required to increase their minimum

capital to Rs.350 million from 3l December2004 and to Rs.400mrllion from I July 2005. In terms of this direction, from IApril 2003 PDs were required to maintain a capital adequacyratio (CAR) of 5 per cent, which was 3 per cent earlier.A direction on FRA and IRS was issued in April 2003.Financial derivatives such as FRAs and IRSs are useful for

managing interest rate risks. In terms of this direction, PDs arerequired to maintain an additional capital of 12 per cent of risk

weighted assets (RWA).Direction on firm two-way quotes (bid and offer prices)for benchmark maturities was issued in July 2003 to promotethe liquidity of medium and long-term instruments. PDD also

issued a direction on Special Risk Reserve to promote safety,soundness and stability of the PD system and to build the PD

capital base. This direction will be effective from 1 July 2004.

Secondary Market Transactions ofPrimary Dealers

Secondary market transactions involving outright purchases and

sales, repurchases and reverse repurchases on Treasury bills andTreasury bonds have shown a significant increase in bothvolume and value in 2003. Based on the information compiledthrough the PD weekly reporting system where a PD is oneparty to the transaction, total outri-eht sales and purchases ofTreasury bills by PDs in the secondary market amounted toRs,265,757 million and Rs.37,408 million respectively, while

outright sales and purchases of rreasury bonds by pDsamounted to Rs.426,965 million and Rs.34g,g0l million,respectively. The repo and reverse repo transactions of rreasurybills amounted to Rs.1,05g,45g million and Rs.240,gl I million,respectively while the repo and reverse repo transactions ofTreasury bonds amounted to Rs.l,93g,5gl million andRs.304,995 million, respectively.PDD compiled market reports on a daily as well as aweekly basis on secondary market activities based on returnssubmitted by PDs. The reports provided aggregate data ontrading volumes and yield rates by maturity for outright andrepurchase transactions. The reports also included weightedaverage market prices and average two-way quotes for Treasurybills and Treasury bonds of different maturities.

Regional Development

The Regional Development Department (RDD) played animportant role in developing and implementing policies andprogrammes with a view to strengthening the small and mediumand microfinance sectors in the country. It continued to providerefinance under various donor funded credit programmes andadminister the credit guarantee schemes applicable to somecredit programmes. Further the RDD continued to implementthe Small Farmers and the Landless credit project (sFLCp) andthe Poverty Alleviation Microfinance project (pAMp) aimedat poverty alleviation in ten selected districts. The departmentalso carried out project inspections and the follow-up work inrespect of on-going and concluded credit schemes.

Tea Development Project (TDp)

The TDP funded by the ADB, which commenced its operationsin 1999 as a follow up to the Small Holder Tea DevelopmentProject whrch was concluded in 1997, completed its fourth yearof operation in2003. The project covers all tea growing districtsand is scheduled ro be completed by 2005. The objectives ofthe project are to increase tea small holders'income on asustainable basis and to improve the environment in the prolectarea. The central Bank is the executing agency of the creditcomponent of the project. under the Project, credit is providedfor replanting of tea, establishment of tea nurseries,rehabilitation and modemisation of tea factories, purchase ofvehicles and construction of green leaf collection centres.The allocation for the credit component is equal toUS dollars 28.1 million (approximarely Rs.2,600 million).Out of the allocation, a sum of Rs,2,373 million has beenapproved to 4,162 eligible sub projects and Rs.2,059 millionhas been disbursed to 3,9i4 sub projects by all participatingFinancial Institutions (PFIs) as ar rhe end 2003. upto the endof 2003, the central Bank had granted refinance facilities toPFIs to the tune of Rs.1,560 million in respect of 3,3gg subloans.

During the first half of the year, the demand for loans fromthe tea small holders remained low due to the unfavourableweather conditions in tea growing districts and the heavy floodsin low grown tea areas. Although the loan demand improveddurin_{ the latter part of the year, the pFIs were unable toachieve loan disbursement targets set for the year. Theydisbursed a total sum of Rs.434.0 million in 2003, which was72 per cent of the target for the year.

preparation of field plan, field staff recruitment and training,

correspondence with government authorities, publicity, the

conduct of pilot surveys and development of the data processingplan were completed according to a planned calendar ofactivities prepared in 2002. The survey commenced in early

October and successfully completed the first round of one

calendar quarter in late December 2003.

Another key event during the year was the conduct of a

special seminar to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the CountryWide Data Collection System (CWDCS) or "Deepadatta" in

Sinhala, of the Statistics Department, which commenced in

1978. The seminar and awards presentation for teachers who

function as statistical investigators in around 100 centres across

the country was held on2J September at the Centre for Banking

Studies (CBS). The Governor of the Central Bank was chief

guest and the Director-General of the Department of Census

and Statistics was the Guest of Honour on this occasion.

The regular and close monitoring of pnce movements inretail and wholesale markets across the country is a key

responsibility of the Department, The Department continued toprepare regular and timely analytical reports on price

developments for policy makers towards facilitating macroeconomic management. Meanwhile price dissemination

initiatives relating to retail and wholesale market prices through

the print and electronic media, continued as usual.Efforts were also made to improve the coverage and

content of the Department's two regular publications, namely

Sn Lanka Socio Economic Data2003 and Economic and SocialStatistics of Sri Lanka 2003 by introducing new tables to

provide more regionally disaggregated economic statistics and

rationalising obsolete statistical tables in both publications. The

former was made available to the public in both print and

electronic media.During the year under review more training opportunities

were made available to the officers of the Depzutment when

compared to 2002, whtch helped them to enhance their

professional capabilities. Accordin gly, 17 staff officers and 20

non-staff class officers underwent training conducted by CBS,

MDC and other local agencies, while specially relevant foreigntraining was received by five staff officers.As in 2002, on a request made by the Department ofStatistics of the University of Colombo, the Departmentprovided industrial placement facilities for two of its

undergraduates for a period of 8 weeks from July 2003.In addition, senior officers of the Department served on and

contributed to several committees and fora at the national policy

level.

Surveys

Consumer Finances and Socio Economic Survey2003104

The Statistics Department finalised all related activities in order

to conduct the above survey and commenced data collection

from sampled households in early October 2003. This will be

continued until September 2004, thus covering a calendar year.During tlus period, data collection will proceed in four roundsof three months each. This is the Sth survey in the series. The

7th survey was conducted in 1996197. Designing, planning and

preparations for the survey were conducted according to an

advance calendar programme that had been prepared in the

previous year.With the conduct of the Census of Population and Housing

(Census) 2001, an upto date population frame was available to

select the required sample of households for the survey. The

Census 2001 could not be completed in 3 districts of theNorthern Province viz, Mannar, Mullativu and Killinochchi.

Hence, these districts had to be excluded from the survey as

there was no population frame available from the Census 2001from which to select a sample. Thus, unlike in 1986/87 and

),996197, the two previous surveys in the series, which did not

cover North and East provinces, this survey covers 22 distnctsin the country excluding only those 3 districts. Data are

expected to be collected from a sample of 11,768 householdsdrawn from 1,509 sampled census blocks. Data collection in

Round I of the survey from 2,897 sampled households has beenalready completed and the processing of data is now in

progress,The primary objective of conducting this survey has beento collect comprehensive data on household income,

expenditure, consumption, savings and investments. In addition,

other important data including demographic features, housing

conditions, socio economic conditions, labour force data and

employment statistics will be collected in this survey. Over the

last five decades, the Consumer Finances and Socio Economic

surveys (CFS) have been a major source of information on

changes in socio economic conditions in the country. These data

have been widely used by decision makers in both the public

and private sectors, planners, researchers, students, socialworkers, international aid agencies and the general public.

Moreover this survey series provides a mechanism for meeting

emerging data needs relating to poverty and economic progress

on a continuous basis.Another important aspect of conducting CFS is that the

latest data on consumption expendirure will be available andthis will strengthen compilation practices of national accounts

where plans are underway to revise the compilation procedure

and definitions from the current System of National Accounts(SNA) 1968 version to be in line with the SNA 1993

recommendations, Moreover, the revised expenditure schedulesof this survey would enable generating and presentingexpenditure data based on the SNA 1993 Classification ofIndividual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP), which is the

cunently recommended intemational standard used in the newly

compiled Sn Lanka ConsumerPrice Index (SLCPI) of the DCS.The survey data are also expected to be used effectively to

revise, update and improve the base weights of all regional price

indices compiled by the Statistics Department.

It is expected that round wise reports based on key suryeyfindings will be released at the completion of each iound ofthe survey. In addition, to statistical findings of the main survey,overall supervision teams in the Department gathered specificinformation in the field with a view to assessing the economicconditions across different regions in the country over differentperiods of the calendar year. In this regard, the coverage of theNorthem and Eastern provinces was found to be particularlyinformative since these areas are being covered in the CFS aftera lapse of 20 years.

Country Wide Data Collection System (CWDCS)The country wide Data collection system of the StatisticsDepartment, which commenced in 197g, completed 25 yearsof operation in 2003. Regular coilection of information on ietailprices of consumer goods, producer prices of agricurturalcommodities, and wage rates pertaining to the informal sectoris carried out under this programme. Data collection isaccomplished through an island-wide network of schoolteachers who function as statistical investigators in 93 of around100 centres established at the inception of the programme.Information thus collected is published regularly through ttreprint and electronic media. The system is also used to identifythe impact of changes in the administered prices of consumeritems as well as to monitor prices of inputs for agriculture inmajor producing areas. The sub sectors covered by the schemeinclude paddy, tea, rubber and coconut cultivation, and alsosmall-scale construction. Seminars were conducted in Matara.colombo, Anuradhapura and Kandy in 2003, to provide furthertraining for the data collectors in order to improve the quality,efficiency and timeliness of their data collection, u, *.ll u, roobtain their input on the reasons for differences in pricedevelopments across regions identified in the computation ofregional consumer price indices. Teacher investigators werealso educated about the need to develop a system of collectinginformation other than prices on the economic activities in therespective regions. They were also made aware of the centralBank's plans to establish a system of collecting information onthe expectations of the general public on price movements andthe impact of macroeconomic policies on economic activities.

computation of the index was obtained fiom I I centres in thecolombo District. of these l1 centres, 5 centres, namely, thePettah Market, Hanwella, Homagama, Moratuwa andAvissawella, were established under cwDCS and the othercentres namely, Kollonnawa, Nugegoda, Dehiwala, piliyandala,

Maharagama and Padukka, were newly introduced in January1999. Following the outsourcing of the collection ofinformation in these centres to a company, field investigatorshired from the company and appointed teacher investigatorscollected infbrmation regularly from these centres throushoutthe year.

since 1998, the Department has computed three regionalconsumer price indices for the districts of Anuradhapura,Matale and Matara. The commodity weights for the indices asin the CDCPI, are based on the expenditure patterns of therespective districts derived from cFS of 1996197 conducted bythe central Bank. These weights were constructed based on thetarget population of the lowest 40 per cent of households inthe district when ranked by income. These indices are usefulin analysing regional price movements. They are also used bymarket players in negotiating forward sales contracts inagricultural commodities. The behaviour of these district priceindices were analysed to provide further insights into pricebehaviour to the policy makers on a monthly basis throughoutthe year.The Statistics Department continued to compile aconsumer price index covering the western province forinternal purposes. This has a wider coverage than cDCpI, bothgeographically and in terms of household income. The mainimprovement in this index is the expanded coverage of aconsumer price index to higher income households and a widergeographical area, This index represents the lowest 64 per centof households in the western province, when ranked by incometaken from the cFS of 1996191. The weights are based on theexpenditure pattern of the representative households. Datacollection centres extended beyond major trading centres usedfor cDCPI, to include super markets in the city to capturechanging consumption patterns of the higher incomehouseholds as well.Computation of Price Indices In addition to the above consumer price indices, rhe

Wholesale Price Index

The Department continued to compute the wholesale Price

Index (WPI), which reflects price movements at the primary

market level. This is a useful indicator of future prlce

movements in retail markets.

National Accounts

The Department continued its activities in connection with the

estimation of National Accounts. These included the collection

of primary and secondary data and compilation of related

stattsttcs.In2003,theDepartmentdisseminatedquarterlynational

accounts, through press conferences, according to an Advance

Release calendar. This enhanced public awaleness of current

trends in economic activity and behaviour. This information

continued to be dispersed through the Central Bank web site.

Timely dissemination of quarterly national accounts data has

also raised public interest in the subject recently'

The quarterly press releases on national accounts cover the

developments in the economy by the production method but

do not yet analyse the economy by the expenditure method.

During2003,theDepartmentbeganpreliminaryworktobuild

a data series on quarterly national accounts by the expenditure

expected that this data series could also be disseminated to the

public in the near future.

Provincial National Accounts

The Department published statistics on Provincial Gross

Domestic Product for the first time in the Annual Report 2002,

where a data series was made available from 1996 upto 2001.

factor cost prices- This series provides a comprehensive

database on provincial economic activities as well as provincial

contribution to national economic development and has been

well received by users of economic statistics. work on

compilation of Provincial GDP fot 2002 continued throughout

2003.

EmploYment Statistics
