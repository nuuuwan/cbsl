It was noted, in particular, that this wasthe only proposal where a firm commrtment was made to infusecapital upfront to PSDB, which was considered as crucial. ifthe PSDB is to be rehabilitared.with regard to Asia capita|s proposar, the MonetaryBoard was of the opinion that despite certain concerns, and thefact that the implementation of the proposal involves thefulfilment of severar conditions precedent, the feasibility of the'proposal could not be completely ruled out. Thus the MlnetaryBoard decided to test its feasibility as against the only otheroption of liquidating the psDB. In forming this opinitn, rheMonetary Board also took cognisance of the fact that eventhough, as currently estimated, the depositors may finailyreceive around 60vo of the capital of deposits on a liquidation,there were other creditors such as those who have investedfunds in money market bills of the psDB who wourd not havequalified for any repayment in a liquidation, as they would notbe treated as depositors in a liquidation.Pending Asia Capital carrying out a due diligence tofinally determine whether they wourd undertake therestructuring of the psDB to enable it to continue to carry onbusiness, the Monetary Board decided that the psDB uepermitted to resume limited business with effec t from 22January 2004, in terms of Section 30(3) of the Monetary LawAct, subject to specified conditions. A further decision on thismatter is expected to be taken by 22 JuIy 2004 after AsiaCapital has completed the due diligence.",

The Bill for this legislation was published in theGovernment Gazette on 1910912003. It was subsequentlylisted in the Order Paper for presentation to Parliament on19lltl2003. Thereafter, the Bill was challenged in the SupremeCourt and the Court determined that certain amendments to theBill are required to make it consistent with the Constitution.These amendments are being attended to by the LegalDraftsman.During the year, measures to remove certain impedimentson current account transactions and to further liberalise capitalaccounl transactions, announced in the Budget for 2003, wereimplemented. These measures included permitting the clearanceby Sri Lanka Customs of all imports without referring toExchange Control, easing of restrictions on rupee lending toforeign controlled companies approved under Section l7 of theBOI Act, enhancing the period permitted for forward purchasesof foreign cunency for the purpose of repayment of loans,permrtting the import of goods on credit basis upto 360 daysat a reasonable rate of interest and the forward purchase offoreign currency for imports from a bank other than the bankhandling the import documents, permitting the conversion intofore ign currency of rupee proceeds of sale of assets mortgagedfor foreign currency loans on default of such loans, and easingrestriction on the issue of guarantees to non residents. Therepatriation out of sri Lanka of sale proceeds of real assetspurchased by non residents out of inward remittances of foreigncurrency brought into the country was also permitted. Inaddition, as a measure of extending the benefit of low interestrates on foreign currency loans to Sn Lankan workers employedabroad, banks were permitted to grant such workers foreigncurrency loans, to be released in rupees, to meet anyrequirement in Sri Lanka against the security of NRFC balancesof such workers, subject to specified terms and conditions.The Exchange Control Department also furtherstreamlined its monitoring activities, with the multipleobjectives of detecting transactions related to terrorism, incompliance with UN regulations, prevention of moneylaundering in terms of guidelines issued by the Financial ActionTask Force (FATF) and prevention of exchange malpractices.Activities relating to the investigation into contraventions ofthe Exchange control Act, registration of freight forwarders andgranting and renewing of permits of travel agents, moneychangers And other persons and entities permitted to acceptforei_qn currency also continued during the year.

However, anybalance funds after the remittance of the permissible sum hadto be kept in a blocked account in the name of the non-residentseller. Ttus decision was implemented by the issue of a Noticeunder the Exchange Control Act published in the GazetteNotification No: l3l2l9 of 28 October 2003.3. Trade TransactionsIn the area of international trade transactions, a majordevelopment was the amendment of the Regulations madeunder the Import and Export (control) Act published in theGazetteNo- 102216 of 8 April 1998 in respect of payment termsfor imports. The amendment was effected by regulations madeunder the same Act published in the Gazette No. r2llll2 of27 February 2003 empowering sri Lanka customs to releaseimports which do not fall within payment terms stipulated inthe earlier regulations without referring to the Controller ofExchange. These included imports on \"no foreign exchangeinvolved basis\" over US dollars 1,000 received as gifts, tradesamples, and equipment and machinery sent by foreigninvestors for their projects in Sri Lanka. This was introducedas a measure of removing existing restrictions on currenftransactions. The maximum period granted for the import ofgoods on advance payment terms was also enhanced fromI month to 3 months by a Regulation published in the GazetteNo. l3l9l28 of l8 December 2003. However, Exchangecontrol continues to monitor import of goods for whichpayment has been made in advance to ensure the anival ofgoods. Two other budget decisions also aimed at providingfufiher facilities for trade transactions were implemented witheff'ect from2r January 2003. one was to permit importers topurchase foreign currency on a forward contract from a bankother than the bank establishing documentary credits forimports and collecting import bills on documents againstacceptance (D/A) terms or against Documents against payments(D/P) terms.

The funds transfer underlying the securitiestransactions are based on a Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)System through which payments will be effectedinstantaneously on a real time basis.An important component of the proposed SSSS will be acDS for govemment securities. cDS is an electronic database,which will record the holdings of govemment securities. cDSwiil perform as the registry as well as the custodian forgovernment securities. SSSS and CDS rogether will be named'LankaSecure'.With the proposed insrallarion of SSSS and CDS in early2004, PDD will have to manage the transition from scripsecurities to scripless securities. Necessary amendments to therelevant legislations to enable the issue and trading of scriplesssecurities as well as dematerialisation of the existing scripsecurities were enacted in 2003.",

The system is also used to identifythe impact of changes in the administered prices of consumeritems as well as to monitor prices of inputs for agriculture inmajor producing areas. The sub sectors covered by the schemeinclude paddy, tea, rubber and coconut cultivation, and alsosmall-scale construction.
