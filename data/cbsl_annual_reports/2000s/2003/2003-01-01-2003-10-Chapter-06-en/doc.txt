The Colombo Consumers' price Index (CCpI), thatmeasures price changes in the consumption basket of the lowest40 per cent of households by their income in the ColomboMunicipality and serves as the official measure of consumerpnce inflation, registered an annual average inflation rate of 6.3per cent by end 2003, against 9.6 per cent in the previous year.other available consumer price indices (cpls) that representconsumption baskets in different geographical regions andexpenditure groups registered annual average inflation rates ofaround 3 per cent or lower by end of the year. The Sri LankaConsumers' Price Index (SLCPI), the most representativdindex available to measure consumer price changes at thenational level, marked an annual average inflation rate of 2.6per cent at end 2003.

Seasonal fluctuations in prices, especially of agriculturalcommodities, which represent a high aggregate share in allCPIs, indicated easing pressure through most of the year. Thiswas reflected in the monthly changes in all cpls in 2003 when

compared with the average changes for corresponding months

in the recent past.Monetary management, focussed on maintaining price

stability, prevented undue int'lationary pressure emanatingfrom aggregate demand. Monetary growth in 2003 averaged

13 per cent, although the end year growth was around l5 per

cent. Significant improvements in fiscal consolidation

supported the realisation of monetary objectives, and

prevented pressure on prices through aggregate demand. The

budget deficit fell to 7 .9 per cent of GDP in 2003, fr-om 8.9 per

cent in 2002. Much of the deficit was financed from non-

inflationary sources and net credit to the government tiom the

banking sector declined during the year. A relatively stable

exchange rate also contributed towards achieving price

stability by minimising inflationary pressure flom impotted

prices through depreciation.

Changes in the domestic production of major consumer

items had contributed significantly to movements in consumer

prices in the past. In 2003 however, the expansion in domestic

production, especially of major consumer items, helped reduce

prices. Agricultural production, which has a great impact on

consumer prices, expanded by 2.9 per cent in 2003 comparedto 1.9 per cent in2002. Within the agriculture sector the

ploduction of major consumer items such as paddy and coconut

rose. Improvements in the distribution network, due to the

improved security situation and the establishment of regional

economic centres, fulther strengthened the favourable ettbctsof production expansion and helped to lowel the domestic

pressures on pnces.

Imported items directly represent around 22 per cent of the

CCPI and around l8 per cent of the SLCPI and their price

movements are another important determinant of overall

inflation. The overall impact from import prices is lelatively

higher, as price increases of intermediate imports, such as crude

oil, wheat grain and f'ertiliser, indirectly influence the overall

price structure through cost of production and ttansport costs'

Higher import prices, through the combined impact of higher

international prices and greater depreciation of the rupee, had

been major contributors to higher inflation in the past. The

situation in 2003 was somewhat different. The Nominal

Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) Index, that reflects the

nominal movement of the rupee vis a vis national currencies of

trading partners and competitors, depreciated by around 6 per

cent compared to the depreciation of around 7 per cent in2002'

However, more than 75 per cent of Sri Lanka's imports are

denominated in US dollars and in 2003,the depreciation of the

rupee against the US dollar was negligible, as against the

corresponding depreciation of 3.7 per cent in 2002 and I I per

cent in 2001. Thus, rupee depreciation impacted minimally on

import prices, Meanwhile, the movements in international

ptices of imported items were mixed during the year' There

were, however, frequent revisions to domestic tuel prices to

retlect international price changes throughout the year.

The combined impact was that, while the pressure on

int'lation from the prices of domestically produced goods

declined, that trom imported goods remained at the same level

as in the previous year, thereby raising the relative share of

direct imported price pressure on the inflation rate' As in the

previous year, wage adustments in both formal and informal

sectors did not impose any significant pressure on prices.

The decrease in inflation in 2002 and 2003 was due to a

number of f avourable factors related to both aggregate demand

and aggregate supply. The future sustainability of the low CPI

inflation will depend on the continuation of such favourable

factors. Upward revisions to public sector wages, which are

likely to be followed by at least certain segments of the private

sector, could trigger some demand pressure as well as cost-

push pressure on prices. The expenses related to the

torthcoming general and provincial elections can add to

demand pressure, unless the new government commits itself tofiscal discipline. Any failure on that front would make

monetary management difficult and maintenance of price

stability all that more difficult. Instability in financial markers,due to the uncertain political environment, can affect theeconomy despite all the favourable advances made inmacroeconomic fundamentals during 2003. Drought in certainparts of the country will affect both agncultural production andelectricity generation, thereby directly leading to rising prices.Future movements in internationalprices, especially of energy,do not appear favourable to the Sri Lanka economy.Accordingly, it is likely that inflation would be higher in2004than in 2003. However, a moderate rise that contains inflationwithin a range of 4 to 6 per cent would ensure the pricestability that would be required to maintain the medium term,macroeconomic targets set early in 2003.6.2 Prices

Prices rose in 2003 at a much lower rate than in the previoustwo years. of the overall annual average ccpl inflation of 14.2per cent in 2001, around 79 per cent was directly due to priceincreases of domestically produced goods. The balance 2l percent was from the price increases in imported goods. hn2002,in the overall inflation of 9.6 per cent, the direct contributionwas around 76 per cent fiom domestic goods. In 2003 thecontribution from the prices of domestically produced goods tothe overall inflation of 6.3 per cent dropped to around 60 percent. The balance 40 per cent was from imported items,particularly kerosene, wheat grain and milk products.Among imported consumer items, prices in terms of USdollars increased for rice (28Vo), dried chillies (lgZo), wheatgrain (1470), milk products (5Vo), and big onions (7Vo), whileprices decreases were observed for potatoes (16To), red onion(l6Vo), dried fish (7Vo) andsugar (5Zo). Wirh the move to moremarket determined pricing mechanisms, adjustments weremade to domestic prices in the mar.ket in response tomovements in international prices, ther.eby reflecting theiractual cost to the consumer.Despite the significant internationalprice increase of rice,there was little impact on domestic prices, as armost the entireconsumption demand was met from increased domesticproduction. Sugar is a key consumer item with low priceelasticity of demand. It represents a share of between 3 and 6per cent in all available cPIs. The domestic retail price of sugardropped by around 3 per cent islandwide, compared to 2002.Prices of milk products, an important consumer item, increasedin the domestic market following international price increases.Prices of all brands of milk food increased within a range of Ito 5 per cent during the year. Prices of other milk basedimported products also increased. A significantly high share ofdomestic consumption of milk products is met by imports.Programmes to boost the dairy industry at household level havenot yet been able to reduce the dependence on imports inmeeting domestic demand.Though consumer goods imports showed mixedbehaviour in their price changes, all intermediate imports thataffect consumer prices indirectly recorded price increases.

Crude oil, the most important intermediate import, which hasboth direct and indirect impact on consumer expenditure,registered a price increase of around L7 per cent in US dollarterms by end 2003, compared to only a 3 per cent increase in2002. Domestic prices of petroleum products, diesel oil,kerosene and petrol, were revised several times during the yearin response to changing international prices. Accordingly,diesel oil prices were revised six times, of which four wereupward and two downwatd resulting in a net increase of around7 per cent by year end. Kerosene prices were also revised withthe same pattern of revisions as diesel to register a net increaseof around 6 per cent by year end, The net increase in petrolprices was 8 per cent by the end of the year after sevenrevisions, of which two were downward revisions.The direct impact of the price increases of these threepetloleum products on consumer expenditure depends on theextent of their use. Accordingly, kerosene prices impact moreon low income groups, especially rural tamilies, as kerosene isa major source of lighting. The diesel price impacts on allsegments of the society through transport costs of goods andpublic transport, while the petrol price impacts more onrelatively higher income families through the cost of privatetransport, However, it is not possible to decompose priceincreases to isolate the impact of rising transport costs. Marketsources reveal that the charges on transport ofgoods have beenrevised upward during 2003 at different rates. Certaintransporters had increased their charges by between Re. I andRs. 1.50 per kg. of high priced commodities such as potatoesand onions. Some other transporters had revised their chargeson bundles of commodities in quantities of 45 kgs. and 65 kgs.within a range of Rs. 30 to Rs. 200. Charges vary according tothe type of commodity and the distance of transport. Pubtictransport fares, which are decided by the National TransportCommission (NTC) using a pricing formula, were raised in2003 by 8 per cent on average. The electricity tarif f is anotheritem that can be affected by fuel prices. and in turn aft'ectsprices of items that use electricity as an input, However, despiterevisions of diesel prices in several rounds in 2003, electricitytariffs were not revised, as increased hydro capacity inelectricity generation helped compensate fbr the rising cost ofthermal power generation. The hydro dependency ratio was 44per cent in 2003 compared to 40 per cent in 2002.Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) is another imported itemthat has both direct and indirect impact on consumerexpenditure. Its importance as a source of energy for cookingis increasing fast, as the main traditional energy source forcooking, firewood, is dwindling in supply and consequentlybecoming more expensive. As a result, LPG consumption isincreasing even in the rural sector. LPG prices were revisedseven times during the year following movements ininternational prices. However, the net annual average changein the price was negligible, as prices which were raisedsignificantly during the first quarter, were brought downduring the second half of the year.

The price of an average sized loaf of bread increased byaround l9 per cent in 2003.The expansion in the domestic production of major fboditems helped reduce the pressure from increased prices ofimports, mainly fuel and fuel related items. Rice and coconutwere significant among such items. Rice represents a relativelyhigh and varying share from 9 to 18 per cent among diff'erentCPIs; around 9 per cent in the CCPI and around 16 per cent inthe SLCPI, with the highest share associated with theAnuradhapura cPI (APCPI). Retail prices of all varieties of ricedecreased in 2003 within a range of around 3 to l3 per cent,where raw red rice had the highest and samba had the lowestdrop in price. This was in contrast to the significant priceincreases for rice ranging from 12 to 23 per cent in 2002.Theincreased availability of rice due to the expansion in paddyproduction conhibuted to lower prices for rice. Coconut, whichhas a share ranging from 2 to 7 per cent in the CpIs, registeredprice declines from 8 to I I per cent among different sized nuts,In2002, coconut prices increased by around 63 to73 per cent.The price ofcoconut oil dropped by around 15 per cent in 2003,in contrast to an increase in 2002 of around 40 per cent.Improved weather conditions towards the end of 2002 from adrought situation in 2001, contributed to increase coconurproduction by around 7 per cent and lower coconut prices in2003. Most varieties of pulses, which have a relatively lowshare of around I per cent in the average consumption basket,registered price decreases in 2003 due to expansion inproduction.Among other domestically produced consumer items,significant increases were observed in the prices of fish, meat,eggs, fresh milk and vegetables. Fish represents a share rangingfrom around 3 to l0 per cent in the average consumption basket

in different CPIs. Fish production dropped by around 6 per centin 2003, as against an increase of around 6 per cent rn 2002,resulting in significantly higher prices for almost all varietiesof fish in 2003. Fish prices increased within a range of 3 to I Iper cent.Health hazards related to meat consumption and increasedawareness of their implications seem to have prompted a shiftin demand from meat and meat products to fish. Consequently,the demand pressure has been mounting on already dwindlingresources, driving up the prices of both marine and inland fishcontinuously. This demand pressure for fish could increasefurther in the future if recent problems faced by the poultryindustry internationally affect the Sri Lankan market, as fishand poultry products are close substitutes. Accordingly, fishprices could continue to rise, unless immediate and etfectivemeasures are taken to increase supply through expansion in fishproduction and impolts to meet the increasing demand. Pricesof almost all varieties of inland fish also increased during theyear in a range of I to l8 per cent. A large area under inlandwaters still remains unexploited fbr inland fishing. A well-planned programme to utilise this source can help meet part ofthe rising demand in the future.

Prices of all varieties of meat also increased in 2003. Theincreases ranged from around 7 per cent (pork) to around 13 percent (mutton). Beef prices increased by around 10 per cent.Prices of all varieties of meat, except chicken, had increased byaround 7 - 8 per cent in 2002, as well. The price of chickenincreased by around l0 per cent in 2003, in contrast to themarginal drop in 2002. Egg prices increased by about 8 per centin both 2002 and 2003. Fish prices rose in both 2002 and 2003.Prices of all brands of canned fish increased within a range of8 to ll per cent, following higher increases from 14 to l8 percent in 2002. Dried fish, a close substitute for all types of fishand meat, also rose in price within a range of l0 to 20 per centcompared with 3 to l5 per cent increase in 2002. Fresh milkprices increased by around 14 per cent in 2003 following anincrease of around I0 per cent in 2002.As shown above, the pl'ices of almost all major sources ofanimal protein have increased in the recent past, which couldhave long-term, but directly immeasurable, eff'ects on thenational nutrition level, with more adverse effects especially onlow-income families. These negative effects on nutdtion canhave far-reaching repercussions on labout productivity and thenational health care bill. An effective and consolidatedapproach is urgently required to address this potential problem.Vegetables, which are mostly domestically produced andhave a combined representation of 4 to 6 per cent in all CPIs,rose in price in 2003 over the previous year. Vegetable priceshad risen in2002 as well. Vegetable production during 2003increased by around 1 p.r cent. The increased demand forvegetables with rising prices fbr both fish and meat could haveresulted in these price increases. Although the internationalprice of potatoes dropped by around 16 per cent in US dollarferms, domestic retail prices remained high at the 2002 level

Central Bank of Sri LankaAnnual Report - 2003139

Part IChapter 6 - PRICES AND WAGES

due to the specific import duty of Rs. 20 per kg introduced toprotect domestic potato farmers. As in previous years, pricesof local potato remained above those of imported potato in2003. The expansion of trading activities with increasedmovement of goods between the North and East and other

areas of the country influenced both the demand and supply ofgoods in both areas. Agricultural commodities produced in

areas which hitherto had no access to markets outside, wereavailable at relatively lower prices after the ceasefire. At the

same time, flows of certain vegetables to the North and Eastfrom other parts of the country exerted some pressure onprices and with access to new markets in the North and the

East, prices of certain vegetables produced in other parts of thecountry did not drop to their historical low levels duringharvesting seasons. The prices of subsidiary food crops otherthan potatoes, big onions, red onions and dried chillies, also

increased by about 9 to 14 per cent due mainly to the drop inproduction by around 4 per cent.Mixed trends were observed in the price movements offruits. Certain imported fruits, which are freely available in themarketplace islandwide, registered price declines of betweenl0 per cent and l5 per cent, while prices of others increasedmarginally in 2003. Increasing competition in the importedfruit trade and a relatively stable rupee are given as reasons forthese developments. Among major domestically producedfruits, prices of some varieties of banana fell, along with someseasonal fruits. Prices of almost all varieties of mangoincreased at rates ranging from l4 to l6 per cent. Due toexpansion in production, prices of papaw and pineapplesremained fairly stable in 2003, in conh'ast to higher increasesof around l0 and l9 per cent, respectively, in2002. Newlydeveloped varieties of papaw with increased productivity arenow available in the market,One important observation regarding domesticallyproduced fruits was the supply of substandard products.

Informal surveys both in producing areas and among retailersrevealed widespread use of chemicals to ripen fruits as well astomatoes plucked immaturely, The Consumer ProtectionAuthority and others whose responsibility includes ensuringfair-trading practices and public health, seem ineffective. Thissituation could fuel another health hazard in a different form

and is an area where further action is required without delay.

Despite repeated references made to the traditional andwasteful handling, storage, packaging and transportation ofdomestically produced perishable food items, no tangible

improvements are observed yet. Improvements in productivitythrough high yielding varieties and improved and modern

methods of production, which are taking place on a small scale,

have to be expanded to maintain price stability over time.Among non-food and non-fuel consumer items, mostclothing items declined in price during the year. The marketfor clothing and apparel is flooded with supply due to intensecompetition and duty free imports. Almost all varieties ofpersonal and health care items rose in price in both 2002 and

2003 mainly due to increases in the cost of production. Among

services, medical consultation fees and private tuition f'ees also

increased,

Regional Price Variations

Variations in price levels of the same item among differentregions can exist consequent upon a variety of factors related

to both demand and supply. Signs of narrower price variationswere observed in the recent past with improvements indistribution channels, supported by expanded communicationfacilities and availability of timely market information. The

demand for timely information from institutions and even fromindividuals is increasing. Price information has become animportant item in media news updates. The establishment ofnew economic centres to strengthen the distribution network

has also contributed to such improvements.

For most major consumer items, the coefficient ofvariation (cv)' was less than l0 per cent and has been so overthe last three years (2001, 2002 and2003).ln fact, the CV hasbeen relatively stable for certain items, eg. beans (4To to 6vo),potatoes (5To to 6To) dried chillies (3Vo to 4To) and eggs (gTo).Some items indicated mixed changes in CV. Higher CVs wereobserved for items such as brinjals and some varieties of fish.Quality differences and market conditions may havecontributed to such volatility. It may not be lealistic at thisjuncture of Sri Lanka's market development to expect very lowprice variations for certain items since there are many aspectsof theil ploduction, handling, transportation and storage thatvary significantly across regions and need to be improvedfulther to achieve price stability.

1 The coefficient of Variation (cV) is a statistical measure thatmeasures the average variability of the values of a given itemrelative to its average value. Accordingly, a lower cv indicatesless variability and vice versa. This statistic can be used roanalyse relative price variations among the main markets.

Colornbo Consunlcrs' I'ricc Index (CCPI)

The general declining trend in rhe CCpl throughouI 2002continued during 2003, though with a marginal deviation in themonths of January and February. Consequently, the CCplregistered a lower annual average inflation r-ate of 6.3 per centduring the year compared to 9.6 per cent in2002. The changein the month to month index indicated declining pressure onplices. The degree of deceleration in the index, as indicated bythe point to point changes (which measure the change in theindex in any month compared to the value of the index in thecorresponding month of the previous year), was greater in thesecond half of the year; the average point to point increaseduring the second half was 4.2 per cent compaled to 8.6 percent in the first half.All sub indices of the CCPI, except Fuel and Lignt,registered lower annual average increases compared to theircorresponding increases in the previous year. The Fuel andLight sub-index with a share of around 4 per cent of the CpIbasket registered the highest annual average increase ofaloundl5 per cent, fbllowing successive revisions to fuel prices duringthe year.

2002 was around 9 per cent. Accordingly, the contribution of

the Fuel and Light category to overall inflation based on theCCPI was around l9 per cent, while the correspondingcontribution was around 7 per cent in 2002. The Food sub-

index, which represents the highest share of around 62 per centin the CPI basket, rose on average by about 6 per cent,

compared to I I per cent in 2002. The pressure from food prices

was lower with a point to point increase of around 4 per centin the Food sub-index duling2003 compared to around 12per

cent in the previous year. Consequently, the contribution of

tbod prices to the overall inf'lation t-ell to around 67 per cent in2003 fLom around 80 peL cent in the previous year.

Accordingly, more than 85 per cent of the CCPI inflation in2003 was attributed to the price increases of fuel and food

items. The deceleration in food price increases mitigated the

hi-eher pressure fiom fuel prices to some extent. The Clothing

sub-index, which has a shat'e of around 9 per cent, increased byaround 3 per cent. Both the point to point increase and the

contlibution to inflation f}om this sub index wet'e al'ound I per

cent. The sub index on Miscellaneous items, with a relatively

higher share of around l9 per cent in the overall CCPI basket

including such items as transport, which are sensitive to energy

prices, increased by around 5 per cent. This index also indicatedsomewhat higher pressure on prices with a point to potnt

increase of around 6 per cent in 2003 compared to around 5 per

cent in the previous year. The contribution of this sub sector tooverall inf-lation was around l3 per cent in 2003 compared to

around I I per cent in the previous year.

The point to point changes tooindicated a similar trend and were much lower than in 2002.The speed of deceleration in the index was greater-in the secondhalf of the year, where the average point to point increase wasaround I per cent when compared with around 3 per cent in theflrst half.As in the case of the other two Colombo based CpIs. theCDCPI also conllrmed that decelelating increases in foodprices dampened the mounting pressure from acceleration inthe price increases of fuel and fuel based consumer items. Themovements of all sub indices of the CDCPI were similar tothose of the other two indices.geographical area of Greater-Colombo which extends beyondthe colombo Municipality, reflected price movements similarto the ccPI. The deceleration of price pressure was indicatedby an annual average increase of ar.ound 3 per cent, comparedto around l0 per cent in 2002. As in the case of the CCpI, thesub-index for Fuel and Light, with a share of around 5 per cent,registered the highest increase of around l3 per cent, which,when compared with the correspondrng increase of around 9per cent in 2002, indicated acceleration in price pressure onitems covered by this sub-index. The movements of sub-indicesof the GCPI indicated a similar pattern of change to that of theCCPI, where fuel and fuel related sub-indices increased athigher rates in 2003 than in2002. The greater decereration infood price increases that helped lower overall price pressureduring 2003 was indrcated by rhe food sub-index of the GCplas well. The sub indices on personal care and householciservices and on miscellaneous items also indicated talling prrcepressure during the reference period, while housing pr.ices (i.e.,rent) remained fairly stable as usual.

movements of regional CPIs compiled for the districts ofAnuradhapura (APCPI), Matale (MLCPI), and Matara(MRCPI). These four regional indices represent the

movements in the prices of consumption baskets of the lowest

40 per cent of households ranked by their income as reflectedin the Consumer Finance and Socio Economic Survey (CFS)

199611997 of the Central Bank. The weight structures of theseindices indicate some differences in consumption patterns,which when combined with regional price variations, couldlead to different resional inflation rates that reflect these

differences.However, in 2003, all regional CPIs ret'lected the generaltrend of falling inf-lation throughout the year, and markedsignificantly Iower inflation rates than in 2002. APCPI andMLCPI registered annual average inflation rates of below 3 percent. As discussed earlier, the corresponding inflation rate

hased on CDCPI was 2 per cent, The respective inflation rateswere around 9 per cent, 8 per cent and 7 per cent in 2002.Meanwhile, the MRCPI actually registered a decline of aroundI per cent when compared with the previous year. This wasattributed to the differences in weights and price changes

among regional indices. Rice and coconuts, price decreases ofwhich had significant impact on the decelerating trend in

overall CPI inflation, represent a combined share of around 22

per cent of the MRCPI basket. Further, price decreases of thesetwo items in Matara during the reference period compared to

the corresponding period of the previous year were higher thanin other regions. In addition, the share of fish, price increasesof which were signiticant, represents a relatively lower share

in MRCPL Additionally, the price increases were lower in this

region than in others,

Sri Lanka Consumers' Price Index (SLCPI)

Movements of the SLCPI during the year reflected the

movements of the CPIs in all regions and confirmed that thedeceleration in consumer price inflation in 2003 was

widespread throughout the country. The SLCPI registered an

annual average inflation rate of below 3 per cent compared to

a corresponding increase of around l0 per cent in 2002.The

deceleration of the price increases of major consumer items,

especially of food items, had a dampening effect on the rising

pressure from fuel and fuel related prices on this CPI as well,Accordingly, all sub-indices of SLCPI, except transport,

recorded deceleration of price increases during the year. The

transport sub-index, which has a share of around 3 per cent,

registered an annual average increase of around 8 per cent in 2003,

compared to around 4 per cent in 2002. Among sub-indices

reflecting lower price pressure, the Food index was significant, as

rt represents around 7l per cent of the overall sLCpI. It registeredan increase of around I percent in 2003 compared to around l0per cent in2002. Accordingly, a moderate increase in food pdces,on average, was the main contributory factor fbr relatively lowislandwide inflation in 2003.A CPI should reflect the current consumption pattern ofconsumers for it to be taken as a meaningful measure of thechanging cost of living in the overall economy. Accordingly, thebase year of the cPI and the degree of both the geographical andexpenditure or income group coverage are importantdeterminants of the representativeness of an index. The currentofficial measure of the cost of living, the ccpl, suffers in thesethree important areas of representation, due to its r-emote baseyear of 1952 and limited coverage confined to only the lowest40 per cent of income groups within the colombo Municipality.The sLCPI was introduced to address these deficiencies. It hasa more recent base period of 1995 to 1997 and covers the lowest80 per cent of expenditure groups in the country except theNorthern and the Eastern provinces. It reflects price movementsin the entire country excluding the Northern plovince. Further,it is anticipated that this index will be revised regularly basedon frequent Household Income and Expenditure surveysconducted by the DCS that reflect changing consumptionpatterns. A comparison of the two CpIs, the CCpI and theSLCPI, reflects that the SLCPI is a more rep'esentative androbust measure of the cost of living in all these aspects andshould gain acceptance as the most representative measure ofconsumer price inflation in Sri Lanka.

Wholesale Price Index

The wholesale Price Index (wpl) captures price movementsat primary market level. They are captured under l3 sub-indices, each covering a major category of goods. pricemovements are further analysed under two specificclassifications based on the direction of use, namely domestic,import and export, and the nature of use, namely consumer,intermediate and investment. Movements of the wpl providesignals about possible price movements at retair level in thenear future. Movements in the wPI in 2003 also confirmedprice developments at retail level ref'lected by different cpls.

Accordingly, the annual average change of the index in 2003was around 3 per cent compared to around I I per cent in 2002and marked easing pressure on prices in primary markets. Thepattern of price movements of different categories of productswas similar to those of comparable categories of CpIs,Accordingly, food prices helped reduce the impact of risingpressure from higher increases in prices offuel and fuel relatedproducts and some other major non food imports. Thefavourable impact of food prices was more significant atprimary market level than at retail level, as the food sub-index,which represents a share of around 68 per cent in the overallWPI, r'egisteled a decline of around 2 per cent in 2003compared to an increase of around l4 per cent in 2002, whereasfood sub-indices of cPIs marked increases but at significantlylower rates during 2003. Among major non food sub-indices,the one on petloleum products with the second highest weightof around 6 per cent increased by around 9 per cent comparedto around 5 per cent in2002. The sub-index on fuel and light,which has a share of around 2 per cent increased by around l5per cent compared to only around 2 per cent in2002. The sub-index on chemicals and chemical products, a categoryconsisting mainly of imported items and with a share of around5 per cent, increased by around l3 per cent in 2003. This indexincreased in 2002 at a lower rate of around 9 per cent. Theseprice increases were attributed mainly to the increases in theinternational prices of these items, as the impact of exchangerate movements was minimal. Prices of textiles and fbotwear.as indicated by the respective sub-index, remained tairly stableat the previous year's level, This was ref'lected in the respectivesub-indices of CPIs as well.Under the direction-wise classification, the domesticgroup represents a share just higher than 50 per cent of theoverall WPI, while the import and export groups representaround 2l and 2l per cent, respectively. The domestic groupregistered an annual average price increase of around 4 per centin 2003 compared to around 5 per cent last year. Expansion inproduction, mainly of agricultural commodities, contributed tolower the pressule on prices, The import group registered thehighest pnce increase of around l2 per cent in 2003 comparedto a lower increase of around 2 per cent in 2002.

international prices of intermediate imports such as petroleumwere the main contributory factor. The export group, in

contrast, registered a price decrease of around 3 per cent. Lowerprices of such major exports as coconut and coconut oil,

supported by the expansion in production, led to this outcome.According to the use-wise classification, consumer goodsregistered a price decrease of around I per cent in 2003, in

contrast to an increase of around 12 per cent in the previousyear, mainly due to expansion in domestic agriculturalproduction during the year. The other two categories,

intermediate and investment goods, registered price increasesof around 15 and 12 per cent, which were much higher than

the respective increases in the previous year, aroundi and 4per cent.

6.3 Wages

Wage developments in Sri Lanka can be analysed under two

main categories of employmept, i.e., public sector and private

sector. The private sector again can be divided into the formalprivate sector and informal private sector. The public sector

comprises the central, provincial and local government sectors,

state corporations, statutory boards and state authorities. Wagedevelopments in this sector are monitored through official

wage indices which cover only the non-executive grades in

central government ancl'school-teachers in the public sector.The formal private sector comprises private sector

institutions that contribute to the general Employees' Provident

Source: Central Bank of Sri Lanka

Fund (EPF) or maintain their own provident funds with the

approval of the Commissioner of Labour. Movements of tormal

sector wages are monitored through the minimum wage rateindices that cover only the minimum wage categories of

employees governed by the Wages Boards Trades. Wages are

revised on the decisions of these Wages Boards. Separate wagerate indices are computed by the Department of Labour for

three sectors, namely agriculture, industry and commerce, andservices. A consolidated wage rate is also computed on amonthly basis. lnformation on wages rn the informal private

sector is collected under the Country Wide Data Collection

System (CWDCS) of the Central Bank. (see Box article on

Wage Movements in the Informal Sector)

Public Sector

Public sector wages, as measured by the relevant wage rate

indices, remained unchanged at2002levels, as there were no

wage revisions in 2003. This was in contrast to 2002, whenalthough there were no wage revisions during the year, all

average wage rate indices increased within a range of l5 to 18per cent over the level in 2001, due to large-scale wage

increases granted to all public sector employees towards theend of 2001. When nominal wages are adjusted for CPIinflation in 2003, real wages in all public sector employee

categories covered by wage rate indices dropped by around 3to 6 per cent, depending on the CPI measure used, compared

to real wage increases in 2002.

146Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2003

Part IChapter 0 - PRICES AND WAGES

Formal Private Sector

The consolidated wage rate for the formal private sector basedon minimum wage rates rose by 7 per cent in nominal terms in2003. This increase resulted in areal wage increase of around Iper cent based on the CCPI and 4 per cent based on the SLCPI,when adjusted for inflation during the same period. Theconsolidated wage increased by around 7 per cent in 2002 as well.However, inflation of around l0 per cent lowered real wages inthat year. The sector-wise wage indices experienced somewhatdifferent behavior during 2003, when compared with the overal Iindex, The sub- index for workers in the agriculture sectorincreasedby around 9 percentresulting in areal increase in 2003,compared to a nominal increase of around 8 per cent and aresultant drop in real wages in2002.The other two sub-categoriesin the formal private sector sutfered declines in their real wagesfor the second consecutive year, as nominal minimum wageincreases inboth 2002and2003 were lowerthan the Cplinflationrates during the respective periods. Worker.s in industry andcommerce experienced a nominal minimum wage increase ofaround 2 per cent while workers in the services sector did notexperience any minimum wage revisions and their real wagesdropped further during 2003.However, these indices cover onlythe minimum wages, not all payments to workers.It should be noted that the minimum wage indicesavailable to monitor wage movements in the formal privatesector do not cover the employee groups in higher wagecategories. Such groups, consisting of employees atplofessional levels with technical and managerial skills, usuallyreceive allowances to compensate for consumer price inflation.Some employees in the formal private sector receive cost ofliving allowances which are indexed to movements of CpIinflation. Accordingly, the actual movements in both nominaland real wages in the formal private sector could be differentfrom what was observed with respect to movements ofminimum wage rate indices during 2003.

Informal Private Sector

Wage movements in the informal sector are monitored throughthe information on daily wages collected monthly by theCentral Bank under the CWDCS. However, information socollected is limited only to informal sector activities in theagriculture and construction sectors. Agriculture sectorinformation covers the major crops, paddy, tea, rubber andcoconut. Wages information is available for key activitiesunder each major crop, Though there are distinct labouractivities in each crop sector, unskilled daily wages do not varysignificantly among activities and. hence, unskilled labour canshift easily from one activity to another. However, genderdifferences existed among daily wages. Historically, maleworkers have been paid higher daily wages than females in thesame sector on the presumption, partly supported by fact, thatthe physical output of males is higher than of females. Whilethis practice does not hold for all activities, these wagedifferences were observed in all informal sector activities.Monthly information on construction sector wages isavailable for different skill levels under both masonry andcarpentry. Construction sector activities are carried out on bothdaily wage and contract basis. The importance of contract

based jobs is rising, as workers impose such conditions on theemployer. Employers also tend to prefer that system as the costfor the entire contract can be estimated at the outset, whereas,daily wages require close supervision throughout, involving anopportunity cost. Employees also tend to work longer hoursbeyond the norm of 8 hours per day on contract, as they canthen claim a higher payment, which the contractor is willing topay, for speedy completion of the contract in a short time.These factors have contributed to wage differences undercontract conditions and under daily payment conditions in theconstruction sector.Nominal daily wages for almost all categories under bothagliculture and construction moved upward in 2003 from their

Background

In the intbrmal private sector, employees are not governedby the rules and regulations applied to employee s in eitherthe public sector or the formal plivate sector. Minimumwage regulations and unionised Iabour contracts do notconstrain adjustments in informal sector wages.Consequently. these wages tend to adjust according todemand and supply in the market. This leads to more

frequent wage adjustments compared to wages in the f ormalsectors, Chan_qes in consumer prices, relative scarcity oflabour and chan_ues in productivity. as reflected in themarket prices of commodities u,hich use labour as a primeinput, and the seasonal nature of some activities affectinformal sector wages. This highlights the importance ofmonitoring informal sector wages.

Availability of Information on InformalSector Wages

Inibrmal sector wages data are collected under the CountryWide Data Collection system of the Central Bank(CWDCS), which covers activities in the agriculture andconsh'uction sectors among a Iatge array of informal sectoractivities. These wages are subject to fluctuations during theyear' as activities in both sectors are aftected by weatherconditions, particularly the seasonality of rainfall.Consequently, peaks in demtnd for labour at plantin_e andharvesting in agriculture and the intensity of construction

sector activities vary with the weather.Wage information is available for 4 majol crop sectors,paddy, coconut, tea and rubber, and for masons andcarpenters in the construction sector, This information iscollected monthly for an array of diff'erent activities rvithin

these 6 sectors, Daily wages paid to workers for diff'erentactivities under each crop in the agricultuLe sector arecollected separately for males and females, ivhich arefulther sub-divided base d on whether meals are included ornot (Table 1). The respective numbers of activities for eachcrop are 14, 10, l2 and 13. Construction sector tvages for3 lel'els of skilt, namely, master craftsmen. skilled andunskilled labour, are collected tbr daily basis and contractbasis separately, als0 considering whether" meals areincluded or not (Table 2). As the construction sector is maledominated, with very few female u'orkers, genderdifferences in wages have not been recorded in this sector,except for the unskilled labour category,

Gender and Working Conditions Differencesin the Infornral Sector

Information in tables I and 2 reveal that average wagesdiffered by gender in the case of agriculture md by the typeof labour agreement viz. daily and contract ba^sis, in the caseof construction, ald also by whether meals were providedor not. Daily wages wilhout meals were higher by bettveenRs. 25 and Rs- 40 per day in each category, However,eff-ective $'ages with or without meals on a monthly basesdid not appear to varl' significantly. as workers wrtrkedlonger hours with meals provided than without, and such

benefits compensated the employer fbr the cost of the meals.In the crop sectoLs women rvere consistently paid less

than men, on average by around Rs. 40 (2l%c) in the rubber

sector to Rs. 100 (507c) in the coconut sector per person per

day. Certain activitjes in the agriculture sector are confinedto male lvorke rs, for exampJe plucking coconuts byclimbing, r,vhile some al'e dorninated b),f'emales, such as teitpluckin-r.

average increase in this sector, of around 3 per cent was the

lowest among agricultural sector wages for the year. Arelatively higher wage was paid for building bunds andcleaning than tapping throughout the period, However,

adverse iveather conditions that prevailed in May last year

due to tloods rvould have curtailed tapping actil'ity, thus

reducing wages at that time. With rubber prices rising ininternationai markets, the wage rate for tapping increasedduring the latter part of the year', resulting in a higher rate

of increase fbr tapping than fbr cleaning andbuilding bunds

in 2003. The average daily wage in all l3 activities in this

Conclusion

Information on daily wages rates in the infolmal sectorconfilms that wages in this sector respond to markeI

conditions and retlect the seasonality of demeurd for those

activities, Furthermore, unlike in the forunal sectors, gender

differcnces in wages exist in the intarmal sector, even when

there is no gender dtffbrentiation in the level of skill orphysical output req uired. This indic ates gender

discrimination in the wage rates paid for employment in the

informal sector.

respective levels in2002. within the agriculture sector, rate ofincrease ranged from aroun d2 per cent to around 19 per cent.However, plucking coconuts registered a decline of around 3per cent, in the wake of the decline in coconut prices.Workers in the rubber sector enjoyed the highest wageincrease, which was for tapping (males - 19 per cent, females- l7 per cent). Relatively higher international prices forrubber throughout 2003, which raised production, could havebeen the main reason for these increases, as higher pricescreated additional demand for tappers and consequentlyhigher wages, Daily wages for other activities such asplanting in the rubber sector increased by only 3 per cent in2003. Unlike in the case of tapping, higher prices for rubberdo not create higher demand for such activities, as they arerelated to the long-term improvements in the sector, wheremany factors affect such wage decisions. However, dailywages for those activities were higher than for tapping,because of the relatively heavy work involved.Workers in the paddy sector earned higher daily wageswithin a range of 4 to 13 per cent in 2003. The highest increasewas associated with more strenuous activities such aspreparation of land and ploughing. Less strenuous activitiessuch as transplanting and harvesting registered wage increases

below 10 per cent. The increased demand for labour with theexpansion in the paddy sector during 2003 could be the mainreason for these wage increases. The tea sector also enjoyeddaily wage increases within a range of 5 and I I per cent. Thecoconut sector experienced the lowest daily wage increase of2 per cent for an activity, while wages actually decreased forother activities. Decreases in the price of coconuts during 2003compared to 2002 may be the main reason for such wasedevelopments in this sector.When the above nominal wage increases were adjusted forchanges in consumer price inflation of between 2 and6 per centduring the same period, depending on the CpI used, the changesin real wages in the informal agricultural sector were mixed.Daily wage increases in the construction sector in 2003were within a range of around 7 to 9 per cent. The highestincrease of around 9 per cent was for skilled helpers in bothmasonry and carpentry activities, Hence, employees in theconstruction sector enjoyed real wage increases within a rangeof I to 6 per cent in 2003, depending on rhe Cpl used. Thismay reflect higher demand for these skills in the wake ofrising activities in the construction sector, which grew by 5.5per cent in 2003.
