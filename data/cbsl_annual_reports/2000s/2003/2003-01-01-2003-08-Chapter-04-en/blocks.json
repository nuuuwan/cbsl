In this context, theindustrial sector has to create more employment opportunitiesat the regional level to accomplish the government's povenyreduction strategy. considering the potential of Small andMedium Scale Enterprises (SME's) to create more employmentat Iower investment costs, generate income, alleviate povertyand develop the regions, priority has been given for thedevelopment of the SME sector. A White paper on Small andMedium Sector Promotion, incorporating the vision for thesector, strategies to achieve this vision, an institutionalframework that will impact the sector, incentives and assistanceto the sector was submitted to the line ministries in 2003.Promoting foreign investment and improvingmacroeconomic management are vital to achieve the multipleobjectives of the industrial policy. Although successivegovernments offered a series of incentives and concessions toinvestors, the country failed to attract adequate investmentmainly due to poor infrastructure facilities, regulatory burdensand civil conflict. Rapid technological change, globalisationand heightened competition at national and internationar revelshave changed the business environment in which firmsoperate. Therefore, with the rapidly changing industrial andbusiness environments, industrial policy should aim atenhancing the industrial competitiveness through improvedtechnology, higher product quality and wider market access,by providing a business environment that enhances the abilitvof enterprises to be innovative, flexible and competitive.Some of the existing regulations in the country haveunduly increased business transaction costs, slowed down thedecision-making process of enterprises and have made roomfor political interference and patronage. The unnecessary andcomplex regulations also have encouraged regulators toengage in rent-seeking activities leading to comrption, delays,waste of resources, inefficiencies and revenue loss to thegovernment. To address this problem, the government in 2001,set up a Deregulation Committee under the IndustrialPromotion Act No.46 of 1990. The committee has madeseveral recommendations to the government to overcome theidentified bottlenecks that affect business activities andcompetitiveness of domestic products. Recognising theimportance of these recommendations, the government hasdecided to embark on deregulation in the main areas ofcustoms and tariffs, tax administration, labour laws and landand land titles by simplifying and unifying existing",

As deregulation is a continuous process, thegovernment has reappointed the Committee to examine otherareas that need to be deregulated and to monitor theimplementation of the recommendations that have alreadybeen made. The government has also announced theintroduction of bankruptcy legislation that will protect theinterests of the creditors and facilitate an orderly exit of failedfirms.The rigid and highly distorted labour market has beencited as an impediment to investment flows, employmentcreation and growth of the industrial sector. To overcomethese problems, the government took a number of measures toincrease flexibility and minimise distortions in the labourmarket. Section 68 of the Factories Ordinance Act of 1942 wasamended to permit a female employee to work 60 hoursovertime per month (720 hours per annum) from 100 hours ofovertime per annum permitted earlier. During the year, theIndustrial Dispute Act, Termination of Employment ofWorkmen (Special Provisions) Act and Industrial Disputes(Hearing and Determination of Proceedings-SpecialProvisions) Act were amended to remove rigidity in the labourmarket. This flexibility in the labour market was necessary notonly to protect the jobs of existing workers but also to createmore job opportunities in the future. In any growing economy,job creation for future generations should receive highestpriority and a conducive environment for employers to hireworkers should be created. Prohibitive labour laws prevententerprises from uhdertaking restructuring programmes in theface of difficulties and thereby put even the existing labour atthe risk of losing employment. These amendments becameeffective from 3l December 2003. The formula forcomputation of payment of compensation for laying-off ofworkmen was gazetted in December 2003. These amendmentsare expected to give greater flexibility to employers to adjusttheir workforce to suit business and economic conditions.To promote active dialogue with the private sector inpolicy formulation the govemment has set up Sectorat TaskForces with private sector participation. Task forces were setup in respect of sectors such as rubber, gem and jewellery,coir, plastics, ceramics, spices and allied products, wood andwood based products, leather and leather goods, footwear,packaging, tea and processed food. Each task force wascharged with the responsibility of preparing a five-year planfor the respective sector. These task forces have nowcompleted their five-year plans and the Ministry of EnterpriseDevelopment, Industrial Policy and Investment Promotioncommenced the implementation of the recommendations madein those plans.",

Apparels accounted for 90per cent of output in this category.

The export orders forapparels, which began to increase in the latter part of 2002,improved further after the end of the Iraq war registering a9.8 per cent output growth in the first half of 2003.However, given the high base in the previous year andintense competition in the international markets, the outputdeclined by 9.9 per cent in the third quarter and registeredonly a I per cent moderate growth in the fourth quarter of2003.By 2005, textiles and apparel will be made quota free.Only tariffs, and non-tariff barriers such as labour standardswill remain as a market entry mechanism. As there is only onemore year for phasing out the quota system, the restructuringactivities to prepare for a quota free market environment wasintensified in 2003. Manufacturers took measures to improveproductivity, rationalise production costs, find new nichemarkets, streamline manufacturing processes and to build uptheir own brands. Some factories were merged and broughtunder a single firm for efficient management, productspecialisation and to reap the benefit of the scale ofproduction. In this set up, larger firms handle sales andmarketing in foreign markets using their comparativeadvantage in marketing abilities, and outsourced certainproduction activities to smaller factories,",

To increase productivity and enhance thecompetitiveness in the garment sectors, Budget 2004 proposedto int'oduce a garment sector productivity improvementprogramme through the Joint Apparels Association Forum.This programme will include a grant towards an internationalcampaign to promote the industry and an interest tiee loan formanpower training and development.It seems that the abolition of the quota system under theMulti Fibre Agreement by end 2004 will bring more risks,more challenges and, at the same time, new opportunities.Therefore, a comp.ehensive plan is a necessary prerequisite tominimise these risks and obtain the maximum beneflt tr-om thenew opportunities. Fulther concentration on quality, price,speed of delivery, developing own b'ands and transfbrmingfrom being mere manufacturers to fully integrated serviceproviders lvould be helpful to face future competition.

The establishment of businesslinks with international fashion designers and obtainingt-eedback from buyers on sourcing strategies would be vital tomeet rapidly changing designs in international markets, In ahighly competitive market after 2005, the industry would need[o consist of either more efficient large factories or very leansmaller factories in order to be cost effective and competitive,The industry also needs to be well suppor-ted by backwardlinkages. This is an issue that need to be addressed as early aspossible since sri Lanka does not have an estabrished fablicbase like other competitors in East Asian countries.The quota availability in the US maLket inct-eased by 9.3per cent to 393,8 million pieces in 2003.

In theCanadian market, the quota utilisation rate was below 5 per.cent in respect of coats, fine suits, swimwear, baby garmentsand bed sheets.After the liberalisarion of fabric imports in 1998, somedomestic fabric manufacturers still face difficulties incompeting with imports because of outdated technology, lowquality of products and limited product range. In order tolesolve these problems and to improve the textile industry,sinternational competitiveness, the govemment introduced theTextile Restlucturing Program in 1998. Under this over 130films have submitted modernisation pr-oposals for updatingtechnology in the textiles industr.y as at December 2003. Asbackward integration is vital for future expansion of theapparels industry, the five-year strategy plan of the apparelindustry has paid close attention to developing the textileindustry.
