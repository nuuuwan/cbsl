4.1 Overall Performance and Trends

Industrial output, measured as the output of factory industries,in real terms glew by 4.6 per cent in 2003 compared with 2.8per cent 1n 2002. The growth in nomirral terms stood at 10,3per cent resulting in an implicit price def-lator of 5.4 per centfor the factory industries in 2003. The output of factoryindustries, which accounted for 8l per cent of themanufacturing output, contributed 10.5 per cent to overalleconomic growth in 2003.

The increase in output in 2003 is a composite outcome of

a 5.2 per cent increase in private sector industries and a 7. I percent decline in public sectol industries. The shares of privateand public sectors in factory industries were 96 per cent and4 per cent respectively in 2003. The public sector share ofindustrial output continued to decline since the 1980s due tothe rapid expansion of private sector industries, change in theownership from public to private sector and the reduction ofoutput in public sector industries resulting from inadequatetechnological and human capital improvements, administeredprices detached from market realities, over staffing, problemsin corporate governance and excessive governmentintervention. In private sector industries, the output growth inBOI industries was estimated at 3.9 per cent in 2003, reflecting

a recovery compared with the 1 per cent growth achieved in2002. The output in the non-BOI sector grew by 6.2 per centin 2003, compared Io 4.4 per cent in 2002. Non-BOI industriescontributed -58 per cent to the growth in 2003 and BOI

industries accounted for the balance. The impetus for thegrowth in industrial output in 2003 came mainly from threeout of nine industrial categories, viz., textiles, apparel andleather products; chemical, petroleum, rubber and plasticproducts and fbod, beverage and tobacco products. These threecategories contributed 80 per cent of the industrial sectorgrowth in 2003.In 2003, the industrial sector benefited from the revival ofeconomic activities with the continuation of peace,intelnational donor support, stable exchange rates,improvements of international markets and favourable weather.The adoption of advanced management technique s, firm levelcommitment to enhance competitiveness and high investmentsin modern technology helped the industrial sector to achievehealthy output growth in 2003. Business and investor

confidence remained posrtive with a distinct improvement in

the financial pe rformance in the corporate sector, slowing downof inventories, expansion in capacity utilisation, improvementof macroeconomic management and commitment of thegovernment to implementing structural reforms. Theresumption of investment in the industrial sector was evidentin the steady lise of imports of capital goods and intermediategoods in the latter part of the year'. Despite deflationarypressures in some inter national malkets and intensecompetition from low cost manufacturing countries, exportprices improved, particulariy during the second half of 2003.

Output in domestic market oriented industries, whichgrew only moderately at the beginning of the year, gainedbroad-based growth momentum in the second half of 2003.The growth momentum was seen across all major categories.The revival was led by the demand for consumer non-durables.In particular, a stfong performance was seen in processedfood, beverages, liquor, beer, milk powder and other milkproducts, processed meat, biscuits, animal feed, soap anddetergent, and rubber tyres. The demand for these productscontinued to grow due to higher economic activitiy, the newdemand arising from the North and the East benefiting fromimproved security conditions and distribution capabilities,falling interest rates, moderate inflation, resumption of delayedinvestment projects, a boom in the share martet and increasedharvest in agricultural areas.Major export markets of Sri Lanka improved better thanexpected in 2003, Export market oriented industries such asrubber based products and processed diamond legisteledrelatively higher glowth in 2003. However, output of apparel,textile and ceramic products in volume terms registered onlya moderate growth due to the intense competition ininternational markets. The global competition continued tointensify with the entrance of low cost manufacturers to the

international markets, a growing trend of trading underpreferential agreements and special concessions granted to

some African and Caribbean countries by USA. Preferentialtrade agreements such as the North American Free TradeAgreement (NAFTA), the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI)

and the African Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA) have

reduced the marketing opportunities for Sri Lankan productsin the US market. China, with its massive production

capacity, strong raw material base, continuous improvement of

technology, lower utility costs and higher labour productivity,

has sharpened its competitive edge in the global market. TheEast European and South American countries werecompetitive in terms of lead-time as they are geographically

closer respectively, to the EU and USA,The industrial sector has been undergoing fundamentalrestructuring since the mid 1990s in order to cope with the

changing environment. The process of industrial restructuring

continued in 2003 through mergers and acquisitions, changesin ownership, relocation of factories, closing down of non-profitable production units, changes in technology and cost

reductions. Initiatives were taken to sharpen competitiveness,gain efliciency and raise profitability in the context of changesin market trends, consumer preferences and technology. The

intense application of information technology continued in theareas of order placement, marketing, supply chain

management and strategic decision-making. There were

attempts to maintain an appropriate balance, between the

needs and aspirations of employees and the pursuit of business

strategies requiring cost cutting, manpower reduction and

enhancing efficiency. The high quality of products, on timedelivery, competitive prices and high labour standards

maintained by manufacturers created a strong positive imagefor products manufactured in Sri Lanka among international

buyers.Restructuring efforts of the private sector were facilitated

by the govemment's initiatives to enhance competitiveness. In

2003, the government amended a number of existing labourlaws to improve flexibility in the labour market. The

government is also planning to introduce an Employment andIndustrial Relations Act to increase flexibility in labour

markets, promote the upward mobility of labour and raise

labour productivity aiming at enhancing job opportunities andincreasing remunerations without exerting inflationarypressures. In the telecommunications sector, access to theinternational gateway was liberalised in 2003,leading to areduction in the cost of overseas calls and creation ofopportunities for a greater use of information and

communication technology as the new potential growth areafor the country. Other measutes implemented in the areas of

customs and tax collections reduced business transactions

costs. Setting up a permanent Tariff Commission helped

rectify certain anomalies and distortions in the tariff structure.

Exchange control liberalisation announced in Budget 2003permitted unlimited rupee credit facilities to BOI enterprises

approved under Section 17 of the BOI Act.

Inadequate infrastructure facilities in the areas of roads

and energy, frequent intemrption to power supply and voltagefluctuations, concerns relating to law and order, absence of a

proper bankruptcy legislation and its judicial enforcement

remain major impediments to accelerating industrial growth,

Unnecessary regulations in certain activities, such as time-

consuming reporting requirements and burdensome approvalprocedures have increased business transactions costs.

Increasing competition and sudden shocks in global market

indicates a need for a strategy to diversify export markets andwiden the production base. The private sector should be

assisted with global trade, especially trade negotiations,

dissemination of information regarding market opportunities,improving business environment, enhancing competitiveness,skills developments, improving corporate governance and

maintaining macroeconomic stability. The focus also should

be placed on reforming the power sector as high cost and

inadequate capaciry expansion in power generation will hinder

the future expansion of private investments. New strategies

also need to be formulated to assist small industries to improve

technologies, enhance managerial capabilities and gain access

to international markets,

4,2 Industrial Policy and InstitutionalSupport

The long-run growth of the sector depends primarily on

innovation and productivity growth, Hence, a private sector

led export-oriented industrialisation has been an integral part

of the overall industnal policy of the country since 1977, while

the government has supplied complementary public goods andfulfilled the role of a facilitator. In the changing global market

environment, the long-term industrial policy has given highpriority to developing a globally competitive manufacturingsector that can prosper without protection of tariffs or

subsidies. In order to achieve this goal, the government's rolein industrial sector development has been changed to move

away from being a regulator to a facilitator, Accordingly, theindustrial policy of the government in the recent past was

94Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2003

Part IChapter 4 - INDUSTRY

directed towards removing impediments and unnecessarycontrols on business, improving the business environment,facilitating trade, enhancing competitiveness, improvingcorporate governance, removing restrictions on foreigninvestment flows and facilitating easy access to foreigntechnology and foreign direct investment.Recognising the significant contribution made by theindustrial sector in the creation of employment for bothunskilled and semi-skilled labour, the govemment has proposedin its medium-term macroeconomic framework to mainstreampoverty reduction in industrial policy. In this context, theindustrial sector has to create more employment opportunitiesat the regional level to accomplish the government's povenyreduction strategy. considering the potential of Small andMedium Scale Enterprises (SME's) to create more employmentat Iower investment costs, generate income, alleviate povertyand develop the regions, priority has been given for thedevelopment of the SME sector. A White paper on Small andMedium Sector Promotion, incorporating the vision for thesector, strategies to achieve this vision, an institutionalframework that will impact the sector, incentives and assistanceto the sector was submitted to the line ministries in 2003.Promoting foreign investment and improvingmacroeconomic management are vital to achieve the multipleobjectives of the industrial policy. Although successivegovernments offered a series of incentives and concessions toinvestors, the country failed to attract adequate investmentmainly due to poor infrastructure facilities, regulatory burdensand civil conflict. Rapid technological change, globalisationand heightened competition at national and internationar revelshave changed the business environment in which firmsoperate. Therefore, with the rapidly changing industrial andbusiness environments, industrial policy should aim atenhancing the industrial competitiveness through improvedtechnology, higher product quality and wider market access,by providing a business environment that enhances the abilitvof enterprises to be innovative, flexible and competitive.Some of the existing regulations in the country haveunduly increased business transaction costs, slowed down thedecision-making process of enterprises and have made roomfor political interference and patronage. The unnecessary andcomplex regulations also have encouraged regulators toengage in rent-seeking activities leading to comrption, delays,waste of resources, inefficiencies and revenue loss to thegovernment. To address this problem, the government in 2001,set up a Deregulation Committee under the IndustrialPromotion Act No.46 of 1990. The committee has madeseveral recommendations to the government to overcome theidentified bottlenecks that affect business activities andcompetitiveness of domestic products. Recognising theimportance of these recommendations, the government hasdecided to embark on deregulation in the main areas ofcustoms and tariffs, tax administration, labour laws and landand land titles by simplifying and unifying existing

procedures. As deregulation is a continuous process, thegovernment has reappointed the Committee to examine otherareas that need to be deregulated and to monitor theimplementation of the recommendations that have alreadybeen made. The government has also announced theintroduction of bankruptcy legislation that will protect theinterests of the creditors and facilitate an orderly exit of failedfirms.The rigid and highly distorted labour market has beencited as an impediment to investment flows, employmentcreation and growth of the industrial sector. To overcomethese problems, the government took a number of measures toincrease flexibility and minimise distortions in the labourmarket. Section 68 of the Factories Ordinance Act of 1942 wasamended to permit a female employee to work 60 hoursovertime per month (720 hours per annum) from 100 hours ofovertime per annum permitted earlier. During the year, theIndustrial Dispute Act, Termination of Employment ofWorkmen (Special Provisions) Act and Industrial Disputes(Hearing and Determination of Proceedings-SpecialProvisions) Act were amended to remove rigidity in the labourmarket. This flexibility in the labour market was necessary notonly to protect the jobs of existing workers but also to createmore job opportunities in the future. In any growing economy,job creation for future generations should receive highestpriority and a conducive environment for employers to hireworkers should be created. Prohibitive labour laws prevententerprises from uhdertaking restructuring programmes in theface of difficulties and thereby put even the existing labour atthe risk of losing employment. These amendments becameeffective from 3l December 2003. The formula forcomputation of payment of compensation for laying-off ofworkmen was gazetted in December 2003. These amendmentsare expected to give greater flexibility to employers to adjusttheir workforce to suit business and economic conditions.To promote active dialogue with the private sector inpolicy formulation the govemment has set up Sectorat TaskForces with private sector participation. Task forces were setup in respect of sectors such as rubber, gem and jewellery,coir, plastics, ceramics, spices and allied products, wood andwood based products, leather and leather goods, footwear,packaging, tea and processed food. Each task force wascharged with the responsibility of preparing a five-year planfor the respective sector. These task forces have nowcompleted their five-year plans and the Ministry of EnterpriseDevelopment, Industrial Policy and Investment Promotioncommenced the implementation of the recommendations madein those plans.

Faced with fiscal constraints, the need for eliminatinganomalies resulting from discriminatory incentive regimes andto ensure a level playing field for all investors, the government

decided to rationalise the prevailing incentive structure. In thisregard, Budget 2004 announced the rationalisation of taxexemptions offered under the Inland Revenue Act with effect

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 200395

Part IChapter 4 - INDUSTRY

from April 2004. The industrial sector benefitted from severalindirect incentives in 2003, generated by sound

macroeconomic conditions. Among these were lower interest

and inflation rates, stable exchange rates and the availabilityof more funds to the private sector from the banking sectorresulting from a reduction in government borrowings forbudgetary financing. In addition there was increased local

demand arising from the continuation of the ceasefire. Incontrast, inadequate infrastructure facilities and certainstructural rigidities were indirectly responsible for holding

back growth in the industrial sector. Therefore, implementing

necessary reforms promptly to overcome theses problems will

act as attractive indirect incentives for the industrial sector andstimulate industrial sector growth, In this regard, largeinfiastructure development programmes, including setting upof a coal-fired power plant, announced in Budget 2004 wouldbe a beneficial to the industrial sector, if implemented as

planned.

Exchange control liberalisation announced in Budget2003 permits unlimited rupee credit facilities to BOI

enterprises approved under Section l7 of the BOI Act and

controlled directly or indirectly by persons resident outside SriLanka. Such credit can only be granted by licensedcommercial banks, the National Development Bank and

DFCC Bank. The liberalisation also permitted credit facilities

up to 360 days to buyers resident in Sri Lanka, by a supplierof goods and services not resident in Sri Lanka, at rates ofinterest not higher than the international markets, if thesupplier insisted on payment of interest.The first state sponsored industrial incubator,'Nawabima', to assist start up businesses was set up in 2003

at the Moratuwa University, Initially, I2 firms in the Ieather

and IT sectors were selected. The incubator will offer on-site

management, low cost business space, flexible leases and

technology support under one roof. Other industries, selected

after studying their potential and the need for assistance, will

be incubated in the near future,

4.3 Value Addition and CapacityUtilisation

Value added in the industrial sector in nominal terms increasedby 11 per cent in 2003. In real terms, value added increasedby 4,7 per cent compared with 2.9 per cent in2002. Value

added is derived by subtracting the cost of raw materials andpower and fuel from the ex-factory value of output. The

expansion of capacity utilisation owing to higher domestic

demand, improved technology, stable exchange rates, which

helped to a contain imported raw material costs, and advances

in productrvity had beneficial effects on value addition. Firm

level structural reforms such as closing down of non profitable

production units, changes in technologies, trimming of excesslabour and various cost reduction methods also helped to

improve value addition. However, interruption of power,

higher energy prices and several structural impediments in theeconomy retarded the growth of value addition in the

industrial sector.

Installed capacity in the industrial sector expanded by 3.5per cent in 2003 as compared with 1.8 per cent in 2002.

However, capacity expansion in 2003 slowed as investors

defened the major capacity expansion and new projects until

both international and domestic economic conditions improvefurther. Production capacity in ceramics, food processing,

rubber based products and plastic products increased in 2003.

Capacity in export-oriented industries such as processed tea,

accessories for the apparel industry, artificial flowers,

ornamental ceramics, synthetic gemstones and copper wire

also expanded in 2003. Overall capacity utilisation in the

industrial sector increased from 8l per cent in2002 to 85 per

cent in 2003.

4.4 Cost of Production, Profitability andEmployment

The average ex-factory profit ratio of the non-BOI sectorincreased by 2.3 percentage points to 14.2 per cent in 2003.The profit ratio in the industrial sector was estimated on thebasis of the excess ex-factory value of pr-oduction over thetotal cost of production of 480 non-BOI firms surveyed in2003. The improvement of profitability in 2003 is amribured tothe expansion in domestic sales than the increases in cost ofproduction. The revival of economic activities with theimprovement of consumer and investor confidence, effectivepricing policies of manufacturers and new demand comingfiom the North and the East stimulated domestic sales. Thelower interest rates, waste reduction, better management ofworking capital and optimal use of raw materials helpedcontain cost of production, The slower depreciation of therupee against the US dollar resulted in containing the growthin imported raw material costs. This was most relevant in caseof industrial items such as milk products, wheat flourprocessing, apparels, chemicals, fertiliser and paper and paperproducts. However, the slower depreciation of the rupee

adversely affected the profitability of the export oriented andimport substitution industries. Profitability in the industrial subsectors of soap and detergent, fbod, apparel, fabricated metal,export oriented electronic items, rubber based industries, teaprocessing and tobacco processing improved significantlyduring the year.

The wage bill in the industrial sector increased by 9,I percent in 2003 owing to an increase in the number of employeesby 3.0 per cent and moderate increase in the wage rates. Therelatively low inflation rate in 2003 contained the excessivegrowth in the wage bill. Many companies out-sourced highcost units and resorted to casual or contract laboul to reducethe overall wage bill. The introduction of voluntary retirementschemes in a few industries and the reduction of the overtimebill thlough proper deployment of workers also helped containthe total wage bill. The share of the wage bill in the total costof production increased marginally from 11.8 per centin 2002to I1.9 per cent in 2003. The wage bill, as a percentage of totalcost of production, increased in the industrial categories offood, beverage and tobacco products and chemical lubber andplastic products reflecting an increase in the labour fbrce andhigher production, A decline in the wage share was observedin the industrial categories of fabricated metal and non-metallic mineral products. The share of labour cost was over15 per cent in the industrial categories of textiles, wearingapparel and leather products, wood and wood products andnon-metallic mineral products. The labour costs wererelatively low in the industlial categories of food, beverageand tobacco and fabricated metal productsThe total energy cost in the non-BOI industrial sector,in absolute terms, increased by 8.9 per cent in 2003. Increasedutilisation of electricity with higher capacity utilisation and theupward adjustment in petroleum prices were responsible forthe increase in the energy cost in 2003. However, energy costsas a percentage of the total cost of production in 2003remained unchanged at 5.5 per cent. The share of energy in

Productivity is measured as the ratio of output to input. Itindicates efficiency in a production process and how

effectively inputs are converted into output. More broadly,productivity measures indicate the ability of an economy to

harness its physical and human resources to generate outputin the most efficient way. For Sri Lanka, the future of its

industry crucially depends on raising the productivity of the

sector so as to maintain its competitiveness.Productivity is intimately related to sustained

economic growth, It promotes the effrcient use of the factorsof production. Once growth due to factor accumulation is

exhausted, lon-e run economic grorvth becomes a result offactor productivity, Productivity glowth is a result oftechnological improvements, research and development,

good management and other innovative ways of human andphysical capital utilisation. While productivity

improvement should be at the heut of a firm's strategy, the

government could enhance macroeconomic efficiency by

providi n g suffi cien t i nfrastructure, ensuri ng property li ghts,

enhancing quality of governance, providing saf'ety nets and

other public goods.Competition in international markets is becomingfiercer. Domestic products must be able to competesuccessfully with imports and exports must be able tocompete successfully in international nrar-kels. Malket

borders wiil increasingly becoming more porous and evenn<ln-existent. In international markets, enterprises in SriLanka need to compete against cost effective andcompetitive firms in China, India lnd the other Asian

econonries. Continuous improvement in productivity isessential to be competitive against fhese enterprises. Amajority of Sri Lankan products in the past huve been

compel.ing on price aione, because of low rvages, Wagesctnnol and should not temain low in the long lun.Therefore, the key to addressing higher wages is higherproductivity.Labour ploductivity in the industrial sector in SriLanka has not -slown consistently (Table l) due to firm

important sectors of the economy, marked reductions inbaniers to trade and foreign direct investment, improving

efficiency in critical government functions, maintaining a

stable macroeconomic flamework, commercialisation orprivatisation of government business enterprises,strengthening domestic competition, flotation of the Sri

Lanka rupee and increasing labour market flexibility. Thesepolicy reforms opened the economy to trade, investment,technology and know-how developed overseas and

provided greater tlexibility in product and factor markets toimprove productivity by stlengthening competition liom

domestic and overseas sources. Enterprises have responded

rvith measures including intensive utilisation of infbrmation

technology, product development, improved supply chain

management, training personnel and utilsing advanced

management techniques.

Investment in information technology (lT) is widelyconsidered to be the major productivity enhancinginnovation in the recent past. The intensive use ofinformation technolo-uy during the last decade has ensuledconsistency in product quality and heiped impro\remarketing, supply chain management and stlategic

decision-makin-q to achieve greater e1'f iciency. Enterprises

also have paid greater attention to implovtng the skills oftheir employees and hat,e developed strategies centred

around getting the best out ol'human capital. Increasecl

skills oan influence productivity grorvth in two ways. First,skills can directl;r laise rvorkers' output per hour, Second a

more educated and expefienced workforce can promote theabsorption and further development of advanced

technology, tor example the rapid absorplion of infbrmation

technology in the recent past.

There is a need lor enterplises to continuously put in

place new strategies to develop human capital utilisation

through modern mimageme nt techniq ue s ivhil e encoura-einginnovations through research and developments. They

should always compete in international markets since the

small size of the domestic market does not generally pelmitptoduct specialisetion or delelopment.The governrnenI should continue to put in place a

conducive environment with economic stability, certainty

of policies and well-protected property lights, It should also

provide the physical, procedural and legal infrastructure andpublic -{oods necessary to increase the productivity of

en[elpnses.

the total cost of production in the non-metallic mineral productcategory increased from 17.9 per cent in2002 to l8.l per centin 2003 due to the increase in the prices of furnace oil and gas.Energy costs are a significant proportion of the cost ofproduction in the cement and ceramic industries. The share ofenergy costs is low in the industrial categories of food,beverage and tobacco and paper and paper products.Interest cost, as a percentage of the total cost ofproduction, declined to2.4 per cent in 2003 from2.6 per centin the previous year. A gradual reduction of lending rates ofcommercial banks following the substantial reduction in policyrates of the Central Bank helped contain interest costs. Thereduction of short-term bonowings also helped reduce the totalborrowing cost. The reduction in the interest cost was

prominent in the industrial categories of wood and woodproducts; non-metallic mineral products; textile, paper andpaper products, chemical, rubber and plastic products andfabricated metal products.

Labour Productivity in Industry

Labour productivity, estimated on the basis of the change inthe real value added per man-hour increased by 2.9 per cent in2003 compared with 0.9 per cent increase in the previous year.The improvement in labour productivity was seen in manyindustrial categories. Labour productivity improvedsignificantly in the industnal categories of food, beverages andtobacco (3.5 per cent); textiles, wearing apparel and leather(2.2 per cent); chemical, rubber and plastic (3.3 per cent) and

fabricated metal (2.0 per cent). Rapid expansion ofinformation technology and the installation of automated

systems, especially in the industries of ceramics, cement,bakeries, rubber gloves etc. helped improve labourproductivity. The improvement in labour productivity in 2003is also attnbuted to intense efforts of manufacturers torationalise operations, most effective deployment ofmanpower, introduce better management practices and skills

developments.

Employment

Employment in the industrial sector increased by 3.4 per centin 2003 reflecting the creation of more employmentopportunities in both domestic and export market orientedindustries, Employment in BOI and non-BOI industries roseby 3.5 per cent and 3.0 per cent, respectively, during the year.The BOI industries created 14,474 new employmentopportunities in 2003. The textiles, apparel and leatherproducts-category created 21,075 new job opportunities. Thenew factories established under the Fifty-Garment FactoryProgramme, Minr Export Processing Zones and Industrial

Parks/Estates programmes created most of these employmentopportunities, Apparel manufacturers in export processing

zones and urban areas were not able to fill all the vacancies intheir factories due to lack of skilled and non-skilled labour.Employment in the chemical, rubber and plastic industries

decreased by 12.6 per cent during the year.Employment creation in the non-BOI sector was higherin the industrial categories of food beverage and tobaccoproducts, chemical, rubber and plastic products and non-metallic mineral products. [n the chemical, rubber and plasticproduct category, more employment opportunities werecreated in fertiliser mixing plants, plastics, chemicals andrubber based industries. The growth of employment by 3,5 per

cent in the fabricated metal product industry was marked by

the hrgher absorption of labour in industries in the sub sectorsof fabrication of motorcvcles. electrical cables and electrical

machinery.

4.5 Investment

Foreign Investment

Foreign investment int'lows to Sri Lanka, which increased inthe previous year, rose further in 2003. The peace process,reforms in the labour markets, improvements of

macroeconomic management, stable exchange rates, further

liberalisation of the capital account and relaxation of exchangecontrols helped to attract more fbreign investment in 2003.The BOI, the main foreign investment promotion institution of

the government, approved 598 projects under Section 17 andSection 16 of the BOI Act in 2003. The total investmentcommitments of these projects amounted to Rs.136,12lmillion in 2003. The foreign investment component of theapproved projects under Section l7 of the BOI Act wasRs. 74,979 million (US dollar 776.8 million) in 2003,compared to Rs, 31,612 million (US dollar 328.1million) in

mainly due to the reduction of joint venture collaborationsbetween the foreign investors and Sri Lankans.Accor'ding to the Ministry of Enterprise Development,Industrial Policy and Investment Promotion, 1,588 enterpriseshad been registered with the Ministry at end 2003.Investmentin these enterprises was estimated at Rs.113,977 million andthese industries have a capacity to generate employment fbrabout 278,391 persons. A large share of these investmentswere in the chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic productscate-{ot'y (Rs.29,660 million) foilowed by the industrialcategories of food, beverages and tobacco products (Rs,23,849million), textiles, wearing apparel and leather-products (Rs.20,121 million), non-metallic mineral products (Rs.12,930million) and fabricated metal products (Rs,t0,l l0 million).About 1,136 entetprises with an estimated investment of Rs.101,200 million were located in the Colombo District,fbllowed by 2I8 enterprises with an estimated investment ofRs,7,684 million in the Gampaha Disrrict. Accordingly, thesetwo districts account for 85 per cent of the r.egisteredenterprises and for 96 per cent of total investment.4.6 Availability of Credit to the IndustrialSector

The major soulce of long and shor-t-term credit to the industrialsector in 2003 was bolrowing from commercial banks,development banks and specialised banks, with the issue ofcommercial paper and debentures contributing a small share.During the year, credit extended by commer.cial banks to theindustrial sector registered relatively higher growth, The longand medium-term credit granted by NDB and DFCC Bankgtew by 28 per cent in 2003.

funding assistance from ADB, amounting US dollars 60million provided credit to small and medium scale enterprises

through Commelcial Bank of Ceylon, DFCC Bank, Sampath

Bank, Hatton National Bank and NDB. The lending rate under

this scheme ranges from I I to 14 per cent with a maximum

repayment period of l0 years.

Credit approved by NDB increased from Rs 3,094 millionin 2002 to Rs 4,834 million in 2003 due to the substantial

expansion of direct credit assistance. The direct financial

assistance granted by NDB increased from Rs. 2,53I millionin2002 to Rs.4,130 in 2003. However, refinance facilities

approved by NDB declined to Rs. 223 million from Rs. 506million in 2003 mainly due to the utilisation of a large poltionof funds in existing credit lines. Under the 'sahanya' creditline, NDB approved credit facilities amounting to Rs 87million for the industrial sector. Of the total credit approved

by NDB in 2003, 43 per cent was absorbed by 69 projects in

the chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products category

and 44 per cent by 95 projects in the food, bevelages and

tobacco category.DFCC Bank approved credit facilities amounting to

Rs.4,997 million in respect of 494 industrial projects in 2003

as compared with Rs.4,190 million in respect of 315 projectsin2002.\n2002, DFCC Bank approved Rs. 1,903 million rnrespect of lll projects in food, beverages and tobacco

products; Rs.714 million in respect of 9l projects in textiles,

apparel and leather products, Rs. 623 million in respect of 5l

projects in chemical rubber and plastic products and Rs. 877million in respect of 58 projects in fabricated metal products.

According to the Quarterly Survey of Commercial Bank

Advances and Deposits conducted by the Central Bank of SrrLanka. commercial bank credit to the industrial sector

increased substantially by 12.2 per cent during the first nine

months of 2003 to Rs. 41,501 million from Rs, 31,002 millionin 2002.

4.7 Location of Industry

Most of the industries are located in the districts of Colombo

and Gampaha. The dispersion of industlial units into all the

regions of the country is essential to achieve the declal'ed

objectives of industrial policy such as employment generation,

income generation and effective use of natural and manpower

resources on a uniform basis throughout the country. However,

several factors such as lack of basic infrastructure tacilities in

the legions, poor road network connecting regions with thecountry's main seaport and airport that cause delays intransporting raw materials and finished goods have

discouraged investments in the regions and hindered regionalindustrialisation. The concentration of industries in urban

districts leads to road congestion, environmental pollution,

higher property prices, high rent/lease on factory premises and

lack of accommodation for factory workers in these districts.

Though successive governments have taken several measures

to diversify location through fiscal incentives and Industrial

Parks, Industrial Estates and Export Processing Zones, they

have had only limited success, Until and unless a better road

network, especially, highways are constructed connecting allregions to the country's major seaports and airports, the

government's initiatives on dispelsion of industries into the

legions will not fully materialise.To promote growth and encoulage the use of naturalresources in the regions, Regional Industry Service

Committees were established under the Industrial PromotronAct No 46 of 1990 to examine the requirement of the

4.8 Sectoral Performance

Private Sector Industries

Textiles, wearing apparel and leather products

The output of textiles, apparel and leather products sector,which accounted for 40 per cent of the factory industrialoutput, increased by 2.7 per cent in 2003 compared withgrowth of 1.2 per cent in 2002. Apparels accounted for 90per cent of output in this category. The output in apparel,textiles and leather products sub sectors increased by 2.6 percent, 1.8 per cent and 5.9 per cent, respectively, in 2003.This category contributed23 per cent to the growth of outputin private sector industries in 2003. The export orders forapparels, which began to increase in the latter part of 2002,improved further after the end of the Iraq war registering a9.8 per cent output growth in the first half of 2003.However, given the high base in the previous year andintense competition in the international markets, the outputdeclined by 9.9 per cent in the third quarter and registeredonly a I per cent moderate growth in the fourth quarter of2003.By 2005, textiles and apparel will be made quota free.Only tariffs, and non-tariff barriers such as labour standardswill remain as a market entry mechanism. As there is only onemore year for phasing out the quota system, the restructuringactivities to prepare for a quota free market environment wasintensified in 2003. Manufacturers took measures to improveproductivity, rationalise production costs, find new nichemarkets, streamline manufacturing processes and to build uptheir own brands. Some factories were merged and broughtunder a single firm for efficient management, productspecialisation and to reap the benefit of the scale ofproduction. In this set up, larger firms handle sales andmarketing in foreign markets using their comparativeadvantage in marketing abilities, and outsourced certainproduction activities to smaller factories,

Improvements in supply chain management helped to reduce

East Asian countries were tapped as fabric bases to support the

local industry and attempts were made to develop backward

prepared a five-year strategy plan to enable the apparel

industry to face future challen-tes. Under this plan, apparel

exports are expected to increase tiom the present level of US

objectives of the plan are to transform the industry fiom amere manufacturer to a pLovider of fully integrated services,increase market penetration by supplying value addedgarments and become an internationally r.ecognisedmanufacturer of specific product categories such asspoltswear, casual wea[, children's wear and intimates. TheEight Task Forces were set up to dr-ive a five-year strategyforward in key areas of logistics, backward integratron,technology upgrading, labour, trade agreements, developmentof small and medium scale industr-ies, image building andflnancial refbrms. To increase productivity and enhance thecompetitiveness in the garment sectors, Budget 2004 proposedto int'oduce a garment sector productivity improvementprogramme through the Joint Apparels Association Forum.This programme will include a grant towards an internationalcampaign to promote the industry and an interest tiee loan formanpower training and development.It seems that the abolition of the quota system under theMulti Fibre Agreement by end 2004 will bring more risks,more challenges and, at the same time, new opportunities.Therefore, a comp.ehensive plan is a necessary prerequisite tominimise these risks and obtain the maximum beneflt tr-om thenew opportunities. Fulther concentration on quality, price,speed of delivery, developing own b'ands and transfbrmingfrom being mere manufacturers to fully integrated serviceproviders lvould be helpful to face future competition. Thepromotion of Sri Lanka's image in the industry throughlaunching intense international marketing campaigns intargeted markets and obtaining recognition for high labourstandards in sri Lanka would also be vital to capturecompetitive markets. specialisation in identified productcategories to gain a reputation as a superior manufactur-er-ofspecific ploduct categolies would be an important stlategy toconsolidate existing markets. The establishment of businesslinks with international fashion designers and obtainingt-eedback from buyers on sourcing strategies would be vital tomeet rapidly changing designs in international markets, In ahighly competitive market after 2005, the industry would need[o consist of either more efficient large factories or very leansmaller factories in order to be cost effective and competitive,The industry also needs to be well suppor-ted by backwardlinkages. This is an issue that need to be addressed as early aspossible since sri Lanka does not have an estabrished fablicbase like other competitors in East Asian countries.The quota availability in the US maLket inct-eased by 9.3per cent to 393,8 million pieces in 2003. The quota access rothe canadian market increased by ll.9 per cent to l5 miilionpieces in 2003. Sri Lanka exported 30 different apparel andtextiles items to the us market and I I items to the canadianmarket in 2003. In the US market, the utilisation of quotas inabsolute terms increased marginally by 2.1per cent from251 .2 million pieces in 2002 to 262.6 million pieces in 2003.However, with the increased in quota in 2003, the utilisationrate declined to 65.4 in 2003 fi-om 71.4 in 2002. The quora

utilisation in respect of dresses, knit shilts and blouses, skrrrs,trousers was over 90 per cent during the year. The utilisationrate was below 25 per cent in of playsuits, fabric poplins andspun cell, gloves, suit-type coats, coats non suits, coveralls,overalls and coats due to the slower recovery in the USmarket. The quota utilisation rate in the Canadian marketdeclined marginally from 32.8 percent in2002 to 31.3 percentin 2003. The most popular quota items in the Canadian marketwere trousers, overalls and shorts and underwear. In theCanadian market, the quota utilisation rate was below 5 per.cent in respect of coats, fine suits, swimwear, baby garmentsand bed sheets.After the liberalisarion of fabric imports in 1998, somedomestic fabric manufacturers still face difficulties incompeting with imports because of outdated technology, lowquality of products and limited product range. In order tolesolve these problems and to improve the textile industry,sinternational competitiveness, the govemment introduced theTextile Restlucturing Program in 1998. Under this over 130films have submitted modernisation pr-oposals for updatingtechnology in the textiles industr.y as at December 2003. Asbackward integration is vital for future expansion of theapparels industry, the five-year strategy plan of the apparelindustry has paid close attention to developing the textileindustry. Pugoda was eat'malked as the dedicated textile sitefol future development. The site at Pugoda has the basicinfrastlucture such as electricity, water. roads and a watertreatment plant. In 2003, the Joint Apparel Association Forumbegan discussions with the industry associations in HongKong, USA, India and EU countries ro search fbr possibilitiesfor establishing fabric mills in Sri Lanka by manufacturers inthose countries.The output of the leather goods indusrly increased by 5.9per cent in 2003 reflecting higher performance of bothdomestic and export market oriented industries. The domesticmarket oriented tootwear industry benefited fr.om the highertariff protection. The tariff on every pair of imports rose to Rs,100 in 2003 to protect the industry fi.om cheap imports.

domestic demand for footwear has been growing recently with

improvements in living standards of consumers, manufacturers

have not exploited the full potential of this trend due to

insufficient product development.

Food, beverages and tobacco products

Output in the food, beverages and tobacco category grew by

6.3 per cent in 2003 compared with 4.6 per cent in 2002 and

contnbuted 31 per cent to the industrial sector growth in 2003.

The increased production was registered in the major sub

sectors of food processing (7.1 per cent), beverages (6'6 per

cent) and liquor (12.0 per cent), The output of tobacco sub

sector declined by 3.5 per cent in 2003.

Growth in the food sub sector in 2003 is attributed to the

improved performance in processed food products, biscuits,milk products, fruits and vegetable processing, sugar andanimal feed. The continuous change in food habits,

turnaround in the tourism industry and growing consumer

demand for fast food are driving up the demand for processed

food and processed meat products, Manufacturers of processed

meat introduced new varieties to the market and improvedquality of existing products on the basis of the findings ofconsumer surveys. With this advancement, major

manufacturers have begun to export their products to India, the

United Arab Emirates and the Maldives under their own

brands. The output of biscuits continued to grow due to higher

domestic demand and penetration into new foreign markets.

Domestic demand increased with continuous improvements in

product quality, the introduction of smaller packets andimproved distribution methods, Attractive advertising

campaigns launched by major manufacturers helped to expand

the domestic market size.The animal feed industry continued to grow due to the

growing poultry farming industry. The milk powder packing

industry grew by 4.2per cent in 2003. Milk powder prices in

the domestic market increased with international prices.

However, the demand for milk powder grew responding to thenon-availability of fresh milk at reasonable prices, rapid

urbanisation and aggressive advertising. Several new brands

of milk powder were introduced to the market during the year.

The output of domestically manufactured milk powder

registered only a moderate growth in 2003' The growth in thedomestically manufactured milk powder industry was

constrained by non availability of adequate amounts of fresh

milk. Demand for other milk products such as butter, cheese

and ice cream also increased in 2003 to satisfy demand from

hotels and bakeries with the revival in the tourism industry.

Despite price increases arising from excise duty, the soft

drink industry continued to grow. The growth was facilitatedby the ceasefire that enabled access to those markets. The

application of better work practices and effective management

techniques at factories helped to improve production volumes.

Despite the increase in excise duties, the output of beer and

hard liquor grew by 12.0 per cent in 2003 responding to

increased domestic and foreign demand. Beer manufacturers

were able to consolidate their market share in the Maldives,UK, Japan, Australia and USA through improved packaging

and strengthening of distribution channels. New features in

bottling and packaging, and the strict enforcement of exciselaws helped the authorised hard liquor industry to reduce

counterfeits to a certain degree. With the recent revision to the

excise duty on the tobacco, licensed cigarettes manufacturers

could regain market share lost to illicit producers. However,

overall demand for tobacco products declined by 3.9 per centin 2003, partly as a result of awareness of tobacco related

health problems.

The ouput of the fruits and vegetable processing industry

registered an 8.0 per cent growth in 2003. The recent

introduction of plastic crates and other improved packaging forhandling fruits and vegetables helped reduce wastage.Although there is growing demand, only a few varieties of

fruits and vegetables are being exported due to inegular supply

and lack of standards.

Chemicals, petroleum, rubber and plastic products

The output of chemical, petroleum, rubber and plastic products

grew by 11.1 per cent in 2003 compared with 4.8 per cent in

2002. This category contributed 28 per cent to the growth in

private sector industries in 2003. The increased output was

registered in the major sub sectors of rubber based products

(21.8 per cent), chemical and fertiliser (5.9 per cent), plastics

and PVC (8.5 per cent) and pharmaceuticals and detergents

(5.9 per cent).Despite severe price competition, especially from China

and Malaysia, the output in rubber-based industries grew by

21.8 per cent in 2003. Rubber gloves and tyres received

higher export orders, as demand surged in the aftermath of the

Iraq war. Testing and verification certificates for non-medical

rubber gloves received in 2001, the establishment of direct

marketing links with foreign markets and acquisitions of the

controlling power in a major distribution network in Europe by

a Sri Lankan manufacturer helped the glove industry to

popularise its brands in the European market' Rubber glove

manufacturers, who export their products to the EU also

benefited from rising prices and the appreciation of the euro

during the year.The elimination of customs duties under the Indo-Lanka

Free Trade Agreement in 2003 helped to establish a market for

commercial tyres in India. Tyre manufacturers expanded their

market to SAARC countries, as well as other Asian and

African countries in 2003. The openings up of the Northern

Province and increased economic activity have resulted in a

rapid increase in local road transportation needs, generating

greater demand for tyres, especially tyres used for commercial

vehicles, bicycle tyres and tubes. The increase in rubber tyre

and glove prices in international markets cushioned the impactof higher latex prices in the domestic market and provided

some relief from the pressure from South East Asian

competitors.

The output of soap and detergents grew by 5.9 per centin 2003 as a result of the growing domestic demand and priceadvantage over imported items. Increased use of washingmachines stimulated the demand for detergent powder. Duringthe year, new varieties of detergents were introduced to themarket at substantially rower prices. The growing popularityof herbal products, coupled with improvements in productquality and packaging, stimulated the demand for domesticherbal soap, toothpaste, rotions and cream. The industry wasable to withstand the competition of imports of herbal productsfrom India.Output in the plastics industry grew by g.5 per cent in2003. The relative price advantage and ease of handlingstimulated the demand for plastic furniture and packingmaterial. In addition to growing domestic demand, there wasan increasing overseas demand for plastic furniture, especiallyfrom India. In the chemical sub-sector, output of paints,chemicals, insecticides and mosquito coils grew in 2003.The output of activated carbon declined in 2003 due roinsufficient availability of coconut shells and hiehercompetition in international markets.

Non-metallic mineral products

The output of non-metallic products grew by 6.1 per cent in2003 with improved performance ln cement, processeddiamonds, roofing sheets and concrete products. Domesticdemand for cement, roofing sheets, glass, asbestos andconcrete products increased owing to the expansion inconstruction of houses and commercial buildings with therevival of economic activities in 2003. The internationalmarket for ceramics remained highly competitive with theentrance of new low cost manufacture from china and EastAsian countries. sri Lanka at present exports a range of highquality products such as porcelain tableware, ceramic andporcelain wall and floor tiles and a variety of ornamentalproducts and has caprured niche markets. The industry hashigh operational capabirities, including a highly trainedworkforce, relatively competitive labour costs and designs.The leading manufacturers of tiles have well established brandnames both in the domestic and overseas markets. with thetendency to use more environment friendly natural productsthe ceramic industry has high growth potential in westernmarkets.

The commencement of construction activity in the Northand East stimulated the demand for cement and otherbuilding material. The cement industry benefited fromreduced tariffs on clinker and lower depreciation of the rupeeagainst the us dollar. Responding to customer needs, leadingcement manufacturers introduced several new products to themarket in 2003.

Public Sector Industries

Output in public sector industnal enterprises decreased by 7.1

per cent in real terms in 2003, when compared with a growthof 7.5 per cent in2002. The closure of the oil retinery of the

Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) for routine maintenance

work for about a month in 2003 was mainly responsible for the

decrease the output in public sector industries. The output of

the CPC, which accounts for over 90 per cent of public sector

industrial output, decreased by 7.2 per cent in 2003, Publicsector industrial output, excluding petroleum products,

increased by 3.6 per cent in 2003.

The output of Sevanagala Sugar Industries Ltd increased

by 37 per cent in 2003 due to the increase in crop yield and the

sugar recovery rate benefited by favourable weather in the

sugar cane cultivation areas. The output of Lanka Phosphates

Ltd. grew by 12 per cent in 2003 with the higher demand for

f'ertiliser from the coconut, tea, rubber and paddy sectors. Thefavourable weather that prevailed particularly during the
