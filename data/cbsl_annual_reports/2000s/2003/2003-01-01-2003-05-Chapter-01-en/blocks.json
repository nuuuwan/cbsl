At the same time, on theexpenditure side, the growth in recurrent expenditure wascontained by checking the expansion in the wage bill, defenceexpenditure and transfer payments. Action was also taken tocheck the sharp growth of the unfunded pension liability of thegovernment by bringing new recruits to the governmentservice under a contributory pension scheme. The abuse ofwelfare programmes by the undeserving, thereby burdeningthe taxpayers, was to be checked by designing a new overallwelfare programme under the Welfare Benefit Law. Publicexpenditure allocation was improved by minimising lowpriority rupee funded capital expenditure, In financing thereduced deficit, the main emphasis was placed on concessionalforeign borrowing in order to release more domestic financialresources to the private sector, which was identified as thedriving force in accelerating economic growth and creatingproductive employment.

The recovery in construction activitiessupported the 6.1 per cent growth in the non-metallicindustrial category, consisting of cement, concrete productsand ceramics. The fabricated metal industry grew by 6.7 percent, reflecting mainly the increased demand for agriculturalmachinery, water pumps, steel furniture and electrical items.The paper and paper product industry grew by 4.5 per centand was supported by the demand for packing materials,particularly export oriented industries.The Construction sector, which experienced a setbackduring the past two years, recovered in 2003, recording agrowth rate of 5.5 per cent, and contributed about 6.5 percent to the overall GDP growth. However, the growth wasbelow the original expectation as government capitalexpenditure was cut down by Rs.7.6 billion in the ef'forts tocontain the fiscal deficit. The major growth impetus camefrom the private sector mainly from housing construction.Increased consumer confidence and the availabilit/y offinancial facilities at lower interest rates encouraged privatesector housing construction. Government and publiccorpotation investment expenditure also increased by 46 percent, adding further impetus to the growth in the sector.Meanwhile, some of the rehabilitation and reconstructionwork undertaken in the North and the East, albeit in a limitedway, with external assistance, also contributed to the growth.Construction sector growth momentum was also shown bythe increase in the building material import volume index,which rose by 21.3 per cent in 2003 compared with 3.9 percent in 2002.In the industry sector, the recovery in the Electricity, gasand water sector was notable, recording an annual growth of",

The operated train kilometres remained at thesamee level as in the previous year (i.e., 8 million km) whilegoods transportation dropped by 2 per cent, However,passenger kilometerage increased by 4 per cent, reflecting theimpact of significantly cheaper fares compared with bus fares.The capacity and quality of the public sector transportservices, both bus and railway seryices, further deteriorated in2003, while their increasing reliance on government transfersemphasises the necessity for bold reforms.In 2003, the Banking, insurance and real estate sector,accounting for about 9 per cent of overall GDP and 17 per centof the Services sector, grew by 10.6 per cent following an I l.lper cent growth in 2002, reflecting the increasing financialintermediation in the economy and profitability of the financialsector. The major contributory factors for this growth wereincreased business activity, a boom in the Colombo StockExchange, wider interest margins, expansion in insurance andIeasing activities, and developments in the domestic debtmarket. Financial sector reforms, particularly in the state banksand strengthening of regulatory and supervisory systems,continued in 2003, even though progress was slow inrestructuring state banks.Meanwhile, the record arrivals of tourists, exceeding 0.5million, resulted in a high growth of 22 pr cent in the hotelsand restaurants subsector. The lowest growth of 0.6 per centamong the sub sectors in the Services sector was recorded in2003 by Public administration and defence, reflecting theimpact of the ongoing fiscal consolidation strategy.Health and education services are still largely provided bythe government even though the private sector share has beenrising continuously. In the health services, the private sectorshare has already exceeded more than half with expandingprivate health service facilities. Private sector investment,including foreign investment, continued to expand healthfacilities and improve the quality of service, Meanwhile,public sector health services suffered significantly in 2003from a series of labour disputes resulting in severeinconvenience to the public, particularly to the patients in lowincome groups who cannot afford to obtain private healthservices. Even though private sector education services havebeen expanding continuously in the recent past, archaicrestrictions on the opening of university education to theprivate sector constrained the potential faster expansion ineducation services in the country.",

Analyses indicate that, apart from the twodecade long conflict, inadequate growth, particularly a lowgrowth in agriculture, lack of opportunities and access toresoulces and markets, and isolation of the poor, are the maincauses of poverty. It is encouraging that the poverty reductionstrategy (PRS) outlined in PRSP envisages reducing povertyby accelerating economic growth, improving productivity andremoving bariers, rather than depending on redistr-ibution asattempted in the past. The intended measures includeincreasing access to basic services (health and qualityeducation), connecting to input and output markets throughtransport, communication and information services, reformingland and labour markets, reducing high protectionism towardsimproving competitiveness, improving infrastructure, andstrengthening governance, as well as law and order.",

Thisproposed system will provide an opportunity to raise publicsector wages by a reasonable rate over a 3 year period, whilekeeping the wage bill constant as a ratio of GDP. It will alsoenable the size of civil service, which is consideredsignificantly over staffed, to be reduced. However, the benefitsof this reform programme will depend mainly on the propertargetting to those sections of the cadre where redundancy islargest and containing the compensation package at anaffordable level.As explained in the National Employment Policy issuedin2002 by the Government and emphasised in the previousissues of the Central Bank Annual Report, linking wageincreases to productivity improvement will help to prevent thevicious circle between price increases and wage increases andencourage labour intensive investment creating moreemployment opportunities. In this context, acceleratingstructural reforms that improve productivity, particularlylabour market reforms, has a significant role to play.",

Thirdly, they facilitated economicrecovery by making available more domestic financialresources to the private sector at lower rates.However, still there is a long way to go in order to ensurethe medium-term fiscal sustainability expected in the FMRA,as revenue mobilisation and capital expenditure are very low,while the deficit and debt burden are significanrly higher rhanthe desired levels. The major challenge in moving forward isreversing the declining trend in the revenue to GDp ratio. Thishas declined continuously, from about l9 per cent in early the1990s to 13.2 per cent in 2003. The reduction is about 6 percent of GDP or Rs.l06 billion in relarion to GDp in 2003,which is even larger than the government's annual wage billor total capital expenditure. Reversing this trend will requirechanges in both tax policy and tax administration. In tax policyrefbrms, major emphasis has to be placed on expanding the taxbase, reducing or if possible eliminating tax exemptions,waivers and tax holidays, In tax administration reforms,attention needs to be given to strengthening management,improving human skills, reforming incentive structures,improving accountability, sh'engthening the legal structure andimproving coordination among major revenue mobilisinginstitutions. The proposed Revenue Authority will provide anideal opportunity to address these issues effectively.On the revenue side, a large shortfall was recordedentirely due to poor performance in tax revenue, as non-taxrevenue exceeded the budget target in 2003. The tax/GDp ratiocontinued its decline reaching 13.2per cent in 2003, the lowestrecorded level, in contrast to the expected improvement inBudget 2003. The shortfall was Rs.33.l billion or 12.5 per centof expected tax revenue. This shortfall was mainly due todelays in implementing some revenue proposals, poor taxcompliance and weak tax administration, Slippages in VAT(Rs.23.2 billion) and income rax (Rs.9.l billion) wer-e themajor causes as collections under excise duty and taxes oninternational trade marginally exceeded the annual budgetestimates. The lagged effect of investment allowances andAdvanced Company Tax (ACT) abolished in 2002, poor taxcompliance, weak tax administration and an effective incentivesystem were the major factors that resulted in the largeshortfall of l9 per cent in income tax. Consequently, theincome tax to GDP ratio declined from2.4 per cent in 2002 to2.2 per cent in 2003, despite continuation of economicrecovery and improved corporate sector profitability. Thecorporate income tax to GDP ratio declined below one percent, ref'lecting a 33 per cent reduction during the five-yearperiod 1991-2003r. The shortfall in VAT was mainlyattributed to the postponement of some measures to expand thetax base (such as expansion to wholesale and retail trade),",

The key measures that enabledexpenditure consolidation were the streamlining of det-enceexpenditure, benefits of continuation of the ceasefire, thefreeze on recruitment to the public sector, avoidance of ad hocwage increases, strict control on transfer payments to sub-national levels of government and public institutions andrationalisation of current payments on other goods andservices. The savings in current expenditure were ref-lectedmainly in interest payments (Rs.5.l billion) and currenttransfers and subsidies (Rs.5.7 billion), as expenditure ongoods and services remained almost on talget. The reductionin interest payment was mainly due to a decline in domesticmarket interest rates, replacing of high cost borrowing withlow cost new issues of debt instruments, and improvements inTreasury cash management and public debt management.Despite additional expenditure pressures and unexpectedexpenditure on flood relief, total expenditur.e in 2003 wasbelow the level rn 2002, as well as the budget estimate.Meanwhile, all major items that recorded expenditure overrunsin the past, such as transfers to public institutions andSamurdhi, were maintained well within the budgetaryallocations. These outcomes clearly indicate the government'sstrong commitment to fiscal consolidation, Reflecting thebeneflt of the continuing ceasefire, defence expenditure wascontained at Rs.47 billion, a 4.4 per cent reduction in nominalterms.

Continuation ofthis favourable declining tlend in recurrent expenditure toGDP is crucial for realising the medium-rerm fiscalstabilisation targets envisaged in the FMRA.The public investment programme recorded a marginalimprovement, increasing only to 5 per cent of GDP in 2003from 4.6 per cent of GDP in 2002. This was lower thanexpected in the budget (5,3 per cent of GDP), as well as themedium-term desirable level of over 6 per cent.

Consequently, the foreign reserves of the country rosefurther to comfbrtable levels, while pressure on the exchangerate decreased significantly; in fact, the rupee appreciatedagainst the US dollar, which is the major trading currency,before the political uncertainty in the last quarter of 2003.Finally, the country's external vulnerability declined as theimport coverage and coverage of short-term external liabilitiesby external reserves rose, and the external debt service ratiodecreased. Nevertheless still heavy dependence on only twoexpolt products (tea and garments, accounting for 63 per centof exports) and a few export markets (USA and EU accountingfor 93 per cent of garment exports), high costs of power anddoing business, excessive rigidities in the labour market andpolitical uncertainty have to be addressed effectively toimprove the resilience of the country to external shocks on amore sustainable basis.Several factors contributed to the achievements in 2003.On the domestic front, the benefits of the ceasefire werelef'lected clearly in increased tourist arrivals, capital inflowsand foreign assistance, as well as in reduced defence impor-ts.Improved macroeconomic management and continuation ofstructural reforms not only increased exports but alsoencouraged foreign investment and concessional foreignfinancing inflows.

The Intermediatecategory accounted for more than half (56 per cent) of theincrease in total imports. Despite a sharp increase in petroleumprices (21 per cent), the petroleum import bill declined byabout 6 per cent due to a reduction in import volume,reflecting the reduced demand for fuel for thermal powergeneration. The second largest import category (22 per cent),consumer goods, expanded by 12 per cent, mainly reflectinga sharp increase in the import of non-food and drink andcontributed29 per cent of the increase in the total imoortvalue, Reflecting the impact of improved consumerconfldence, all major categories of consumer durable importsincreased significantly. with increased domestic agricuLturalproduction, the import volume of food items decreased by2 per cent in 2003 from an increase of 2l per cent in 2002.Imports of investment goods, accounting tbr about 20 per centof the total import bill, rose by l3 per cent and accounted for26 per cent of the increase in total inrport value. Reflectingrecovery in investment, all sub categories in capital goodsimports increased in 2003; h-ansport equipment by 37 per cent,building materials by 2l per cent and machinery andequipment by 9 per cent.In 2003, international prrces moved in favour of SriLanka, improving the terms of trade by 7 .4 per cent,compared with a 4.6 per cent improvement in 2002. This wasa combined outcome of an increase in the export unit priceindex and a decline in the import unit price index. The exportprice index rose by 5.5 per cent, compa'ed with a decline of4.1 per cent in 2002, solely benefitting from price increasesin manufactu'ing exports. Even though textile and garmentexports recorded a moderate price increase (3.6 per cent),non-garment exports experienced a relatively high priceincrease of ll.9 per cent. The unit price index for overallimpor-ts declined about 1.8 per cent fbllowing an g.3 per centdecrease in 20a2. This was entirely due to a decline in theinvestment goods prices (-1,2.3 per cent), as import pr.ices forintermediate (4.6 per cent) and consumer goods (0.5 per cent)recorded increases. The impact of the sharp increase inpetroleum prices (18 per cent) in intermediate goods wasmoderated by a decline in the import prices of textiles(-0.3 per cent).The direction of external trade continued to change,increasing the relative share of developing countries, albeitslowly. The share of developing countries as Sri Lanka'sexport destinations increased trom22 per cent in 1995 to 25per cent in 2003, while their share in the country's importsincreased from 64 to 68 per cent during the same period. Thegovernment continued its efforts to improve trade relationswith major trading partners in order to accelerate exportdiversification. In this context, special emphasis has beenplaced on negotiations with India, USA and EU as the lattertwo are the largest buyers of Sri Lankq's exports, while Indiais the largest source of imports.",

    "text": "The services account recorded a significant improvementowing to increased earnings from tourism and transportation,and recorded an increase of 34 per cent in net inflows in 2003.Tourist earning rose by 30 per cent. at a higher rate thananivals, (27 per cent) reflecting an increase in average touristspending. Net transportation services, which includedpassenger fares, freight services and port related services,increased by l0 per cent owing mainly to increasedtransshipment cargo handling and the country's externar trade,in addjtion to booming tourist arrivals. Meanwhile, the deficitin the income account contracted notably, owing to increasedincome earnings from the country's international reserves.Despite continuation of Iow interest rates in intelnationalfinancial markets, increased external reserves andimprovements in official reserve management raised thereceipts in the income account, reversing the declining trendrecorded in the previous years. Income generated from theofficial external reserves more than doubled, rising fr-om USdollars 4l million in2002, to US dollars l l0 million in 2003,which was sufficient to cover 75 per cent of the interestpayments on government external debt.Current transfers continued to grow steadily, recording a9 per cent growth in 2003. This was mainly due to increasingremittances by migrant workers, who remitted US dollars1,414 million, an increase of l0 per cent in 2003. The higherannual increase than in previous years was due to an increasein the number of migrant workers and higher h'ansf-ers in thefirst qualter of 2003 caused by the uncertainties that prevailedin the Middle East region prior to the war in Iraq. The ongoingefforts for peace and the improved security situation in theNorth and the East also contributed to channelling more fundsthrough the formal financial sector. Despite a recen[ decline,West Asia accounted for the largest share (57 per cent) ofremittances, while the share of the second largest source,Europe, rose to l8 per cent. Other major contributors wereNorth America (6 per cent) and the Far East (5 per cent).Remittances have become the most steady and largest singlenet foreign exchange source to Sri Lanka, and were sufficientto cover 92 per cent of the h'ade deficit in 2003. Similarly,worker remittances have a greater distributional impact as theirbenefits are spread among a large number of low incomefamilies scattered all over the country.In the capital and financial accounts, inflows to thegovernment through loans and privatisation proceeds, andcontinuation of foreign direct investment helped to record alarge net int'low. Increased donor asslstance as a strong supportfor the peace process, improvement in economic management,implementation of structural refolms, and improvements in aidutilisation resulted in a significant increase in long-terminflows to the government. The gross long-term inf'lows to thegovernment increased by 68 per cent to US dollars 90gmillion, while the net value rose by more rhan three times,reaching US d.ollars 548 million, compared with US dollars162 million io2002.

However, market rates moved near the Repurchaserate, as the market formed a perception of a continueddownward trend in lates, due to the downward trend inintlation and the persistent excess liquidity, On average,excess liquidity was alound Rs. 9 billion, though asignificant var:iation was observed at times, The Bankconducted repurchase auctions on every working day toabsorb excess liquidity, except on one day on which marketliquidify was in balancre. Howel'er, the amount ofi.ered at theauction was lower than the estimated excess liquidity. Thiswas on account of several considerations includin_g (a)pos-sible en'ors in liquidity assessment (b) the leewaybetween the actual l'eserve money and target and (c) thevicws of market participants that a certain level of excessliquidity should be nraintained in the market in view ofcertain ngidities, such as lending limits imposed by bankson each other, On average, the amount offered was aboutRs. 3,7 biltion less than the estimated liqLridiry surplus. Thebalance was absorbed under the standing facilities.Under the present system of monetary operations, asthe Cenlral Bank actively miuiages market liquidity, therehas never been a shortage of liquidity'except on oneoccasion when the surplus was closer to zer.o. Nevertheless,reverse t'epurchase facilities undel standing tirciltties wereutilised on two days in April and three days in May (onaverage less than I{s.2 biilion per day).

The balance Rs.5 billion inthe increase was recorded in the deposits of commercial bankswith the Central Bank reflecting increased SRR with anexpanding deposit base.The growth in consolidated broad money supply (MrJ,which remained in a range of 12-13 per cent duLing the firstthree quarters, accelerated during the fourth quarteL, reaching15.3 per cent at end 2003, mainly due to an increase in creditto the private sector. The increase in money supply (Rs.95billion) was mainly dliven by increased NFA of the bankingsystem (Rs.56 billion), reflecting a large surplus in the BOpand the increase in privare sector credit (Rs.75 billion or 16.9per cent) caused by increased credit demand in all majoreconomic sectors with the economic recovery. High incr.easesof private sector credit utilisation were mainly recorded intourism, agriculture, manufacturing, housing and consumption.A reduction in public sector credit (about Rs,24 billion) partlyoffset the effect of increases in private sector credit, faciritatingmonetary management. Net credit to the government (NCG)declined by about Rs.17 billion with improved fiscalconsolidation, while the credit utilisation by publiccorporations declined by about Rs.7 billion, mainly reflectingimprovements in the cash f-lows of the CpC and CEB and therestructuring of CWE's credit through the issue of Treasurybonds.Monetary aggregates (Mo) in the financial survey, whichinclude the activities of licensed specialised banks and flnancecompanies in addition to the activities of the Central Bank andcommercial banks, recorded similar trends in 2003. Monetarygrowth, as measured by the increase in Mo, recorded an annualgrowth of l6 per cent in 2003 compared with the 14 per centgrowth in 2002. NCG rose by Rs.4 billion in rhe financialsurvey, in contrast to a decrease by Rs.2l billion in themonetary survey, as the investment by LSBs in governmentpaper increased by Rs.26 billion, mainly due to a substantialincrease in investments by the NSB.

Meanwhile, theincome velocity of money (i.e,, GDP at market prices/Mrn)declined to 2.65 in 2003 from 2.70 in 2002, reflectingdeclining infl ationary expectations, expanding financial assets,and financial deepening in the economy.Interest Rates: The declining trend in market interestrates continued in 2003, despite some marginal reversalstowards end of the year, shifting the entire interest ratestructure downward and reducing active policy rates, moneymarket rates and yields on government securities to singledigit levels. The major contributory factors for the reductionin market rates were reductions in the Central Bank's policyrates, greater fiscal discipline and public enterprise reformsthat reduced demand fbr domestic rupee funds, increasedmarket liquidity and reduced inflationary expectations.Following the reduction in policy rates, call market ratesdeclined by 280 basis points (bps) to 7.59 per cenr in 2003while its variation remained low, reflecting a greater stabilityin the money market. Similarly, decreases were seen in theovernight Sri Lanka Intelbank Offered Rate (SLIBOR) (294bps) and the Average Weighted Plime Lending Rate (AWPR)(298 bps). All Treasury bill auctions were oversubscribed andtheir yields decleased by 257 -267 bps to a range of I .24 - 7 .35per cent. The secondary market yields on governmentsecurities also recorded similal declines and resulted in aflatter yield curve indicating market expectations of lowerinflation in the medium term. In this environment thegovernment was able to issue Treasury bonds with longmaturity (10, 15 and 20 years) at low rates of 6.08 - 9.08 percent, These issues helped to develop a benchmark yield curve,which was a long overdue necessity in developing thedomestic debt market. In general, commercisl banks reducedtheir average lending rates less than their average deposit rates.The spread computed based on average interest yield andaverage interest cost, declined by about 50 bps towards the endof 2003, but was still high (see Box l9). The continuation ofa high interest spread of 4 - 5 percentage points has raisedconcerns regarding the efficiency and competitiveness of thebanking system. Major causal factors explaining this highspread are: high non-performing loans (NPLs), increasedoperational costs, high dependence on interest income, the lackof instruments with floating rates, weak competitiveness andinadequate availability of infolmation, The Cenh.al Bank hasaheady begun to publish bankwise interest rates and charges,while encouraging banks to publish their own rates in order toreduce the splead through competition. Continuation offlnancial sector reforms, improvement in risk management ofcommercial banks, improving credit repayment culture,strengthening competition and encouraging mergers arenecessary to bring down the spread to a level comparable withother countries, i,e., 100 - 200 bps.Internatirrnally, interest rates remained low and evendeclined in some countries in 2003 as maior countries eased",

This would be attainedthrough an enhancement of government revenue and arationalisation of recurrent expenditure, while maintainingadequate public investment, particularly on infrastructuredevelopment. A time-bound comprehensive structural refbrmprogramme, consisting of reforms in all major sectors asidentified in Sri Lanka's PRSP, i.e., labour market, regulatorysystem, utilities, civil service, public enterprises, financialsector, pensions and judicial system, will reinforce theimprovement in macroeconomic management and enhanceeconomic growth prospects by expanding capacity andimproving factor productivity in the economy. Such measureswill also help to complete successfully the major donorassistance programmes such as the PRGF with the IMF, thePRSC with the World Bank and the country assistancestrategies with the ADB and Japan, thereby strengthening thecountry's policy credibility, encouraging more donor supportand attracting long-term foleign private investment inflows.Consequently, improvements in macroeconomic managementand the eft'ective implementation of structural lefbrms withadequate emphasis on enhancing market access to the poor andthereby expanding their economic opportunities, will move thecountry to a sustainable high growth path with trickle downeffects, enabling the country to resolve the majormacroeconomic problems, viz., poverty, unemployment andinf'lation on a more sustainable basis.An early and lasting peace is essential to ensure thecountry's future economic prosperity. Any delay on that fiontwill deny the nation the immense potential benefits of peace.A reversal of the ongoing process will exelt even greatereconomic, political and social costs, which the country cannotafford to bear.

This is lower than the growth rate of 6 per centprojected earlier for 2004, mainly due to the continuation ofdry weather conditions at the beginning of 2004 adverselyaff'ecting agricultural production and hydropower generation.The Services sector is projected to account fbr 69 per cent ofthe overall growth in GDP, benefitting from a continuation ofthe growth momentum in trade, telecommunications, financialservices, tourism and port services. The Industry sector isexpected to account for a higher relative share of about 29 percent in total GDP growth, compared with 25 per cent in 2003,reflecting growth in the manufacturing sector and expansionin construction activities, Higher dependence on high-costthermal power generation due to poor rainf'all would limit thepotential high growth in the industrial sector and hence therealisation of maximum benefits from the favourable externaleconomic environment. The contribution from Agriculture tothe overall economic growth in2004 is expected to be as lowas 2 per cent due to the impact of adverse weather on paddycultivation and some other short-term agricultur.al crops.On the aggregate demand side, the economic growth in2004 is expected to be driven by the increasing exportdemand, continuation of the momentum in domestic privateconsumption and a recovery in investment, albeit marginal.The export sector is expected to benefit from improved growthprospects in the USA and Japan, enhanced trade concessionsfrom the EU to Sri Lankar and expanding opportunities under1 The special incentive arrangement (SlA) granted by the EU forSri Lankan exports with effect from February 2OO4 provides anopportunity for exporters to increase their exports to the EU.",

However, improvement in foleign aid utilisation andstrengthening of foreign investor confidence are critical toachieving the expected improvement in investment as theprojected improvement in national savings would not besufficient to offset the existing resource gap betweeninvestment and savings.Inflation: Inflation based on consumer price indices isestimated to be in a range of 5 - 6 per cent in 2004. This isconsistent with the inf'lation rate expected earlier under themedium-term stabilisation programme despite unenvisagedcost-push factors and a temporary reduction in supply of somedomestic food crops due to the drought. A continuation ofhigher petroleum prices in the international market and wageincreases exceeding productivity improvements would resultin cost-push inf'lationary pressures in 2004. Meanwhile, short-term supply shortages resulting from reductions in paddy andsome other agricultural food crops could also add pressure onprices. In this context, a continuation of a cautious monetarypolicy, supported by prudent fiscal policy and prevention offurther excessive wage increases, is necessary to consolidatethe recent achievements on the pnce stability front by reducinginflation, as well as inflation expectations, steadily.

    "text": "Revised estimates given in this Report indicate a higheroverall fiscal deficit and a larger domestic borrowingrequirement than expected in the Budget due to a potentialrevenue shortfall, expenditure overruns and a shortfall inforeign financing. A potential revenue shortfall of about Rs.l2billion is estimated, reflecting the impact of overestimation ofthe revenue base in the original budget estimates, delays inimplementation of new revenue measures and taxadministration improvement measures due to the dissolution ofParliament, and tax relief granted to contain the rising pricesof selected commodities, The Revenue Authority (RA) was tobe established to improve tax administration and simplify thetax system, enabling higher collections in income tax as wellas in VAT collection in 2004. However, the legislation toestablish the RA has had to be postponed due to thedissolution of Parliament delaying the improvement in taxadministration and hence tax collection. Under recurrentexpenditure, an overrun of about Rs.6.6 billion is expected,mainly reflecting new allocations for drought relief,corrections of salary anomalies in the health sector,expenditure on Parliamentary elections, and additionaltransf-ers to the postal and transport sectors. In contrast, capitalexpenditure has been revised downward by about Rs.7.5billion taking into account delays in investment projects dueto the General election and delays in foreign fundinganangements.Reflecting the changes in revenue and expenditureestimates, the fiscal deficit is estimated to increase by aboutRs.1 I billion to about Rs.l49 billion (7.3 per cent.of GDp), Infinancing the resource gap, a shortfall of about Rs.14 billionis estimated due to delays in disbursements in both programmefinancing and project financing. Meanwhile, an additional sumof about Rs.3 billion is expected under privatisation proceeds,reflecting a spillover of some of privatisation proceeds fromthe previous year. Finally, the increase in the deficit and theshortfall in foreign financing are expected to increase the netdomestic borrowing requirement by about Rs.22 billion toabout Rs.87 billion in 2004. The increased governmentdomestic borrowing could exert pressure on interest rates andresource availability to the private sector though it could belimited as the estimated non-bank resource availability, ataround Rs.l05 billion, is higher than the revised domesticfinancing requirement. However, achievement of even therevised fiscal estimates requires strong commitment andeffective implementation of measures after the Generalelection.Monetary Policy: The challenge to monetarymanagement in 2004 would be the continuation of etforts inmoving towards a low level of inflation, further consolidatingthe recent achievements, while supporting the economicrecovery. Accordingly, the monetary programme fbr 2004 hasbeen prepared targetting monetary expansion (Mrn) of aboutI 3.5 per cent, to be compatible with the overallmacroeconomic framework aimed at achieving economic",

This monetary expansion would beadequate to support an economic growth of around 5.5 percent, while containing inflation to around 5 - 6 per cent in2004.Improvements in both net fbreign assets (NFA) and netdomestic assets (NDA) are expected to contribute to themonetary growth. NFA of the banking system is expected toincrease, reflecting the overall surplus expected in the BOPand contribute about 40 per cent of the increase in moneysupply in 2004. Meanwhile, the entire expansion in NDA isexpected fiom private sector credit expansion of about 15.4per cent, as the public sector is expected to make a repaymentto the banking system for the third consecutive year. Theexpected commercial bank credit increase to the private sectorof about Rs,80 billion, with additional new resources expectedfrom non-commercial bank financial institutions of aboutRs.l8 billion, would help increase private sector economicactivity including investment. The containment of thedomestic bonowing requirement in the budget, even with theincrease indicated in the Pre-election Budgetary PositionReport, and available domestic non-bank resources in theeconomy, would enable the government to reduce its liabilitiesto the banking sector by about Rs.13 billion. Similarly, despitehigher borrowing requirements of the CEB, liabilities of thepublic corporations to the commercial banks are also expectedto decline by about Rs.6 billion tn2004, particulally due to theexpected repayment by the CPC, using proceeds from theprivatisation of some of its activities. Meanwhile, the velocityof money (i.e., GDP/Mrn) is expected to remain at around 2.68reflecting low inflationary expectations. However, realisationof fiscal targets, the expected improvements in the financialposition of public corporations and the achievement of theprojected surplus in the BOP are critical to achieving thesemonetary targets.The Central Bank will continue to rely more on activeopen market operations in achieving these monetary targets byclosely and continuously monitoring developments to takeprompt action. The CBSL intends to continue expanding itspolicy instrument mix to include long-term repos, secondarymarket auctions and direct sales in order to improve liquiditymanagement under OMO. Such measures will also helpdeepen the money and capital markets, As already announcedand published in its website, the Bank will continue to issuemonthly press releases according to a pre-announced annualrelease calendar, explaining the reasons behind its monetarypolicy decisions. This will not only provide more informarionto the public, but will also improve the predictability andunderstanding of monetary policy, while improving thetransparency of monetary management.The continuation of ef'forts to reduce inflation and hence,inflation expectations is necessary in promoting long-termsustainable high growth. Low and stable inflation wouldencourage investment, by reducing uncertainty, improveresource allocation efficiency and save resources wasted inhedging against inflation.

Summary results of the baselinescenario are given in Table Ll0, while the results under allfour scenarios are described briefly below.Baseline Scenario: This is based on the assumptions ofa satisfactory progress in the peace process, effectiveimplementation of policy adjustments and structural reforms,safeguarding law and order, attainment of conducive politicaland social stability in the country and the completion of therequirements under donor supported programmes. Under. thisscenario, economic development is expected, broadlyconsisting of attaining an annual growth of about 7 per centover the medium-term, a decline in inflation to around 4 percent, a reduction of unemployment to about 5 per cent, animprovement in macroeconomic stability and a strengtheningof the resilience of the economy to successfuily face externalshocks. A steady decline in the fiscal deficit will enablemoving closer to the medium-term fiscal targets envisaged inthe FMRA, while releasing more domestic resources to theprivate sector, which is expected to drive economic growth,Increasing domestic and foreign investment will expand thecapacity in the economy and raise productivity. Increasingnational savings will finance a large part of rising investment,helping to contain dependence on foreign savings. Theexternal current account deficit would remain within amanageable level. The surplus rn the capttal and financialaccount, resulting from increasing utilisation of concessionalassistance and private investment inflows, would be sufticientto offset the cun'ent account deticit and record a surplus in theoverall BoP. Foreign reserves would rise to a comfortabrelevel, improving exchange rate stability and reducing externalsector vulnerabilities. The money supply would expand,supporting economic growth without building up inflationarypressures. Interest rates, as well as interest spreads, areexpected to decline with downward adjusting inflationaryexpectations, improving competition in the financial sector anddecreasing non-performing assets in the banking system.Lower population growth at around one per cent, with aneconomic growth of 5 - 7 per cent, will raise the average realper capita income by about 4 - 6 per cent annually. Rising percapita income, increasing job opportunities and expandingeconomic opportunities, particularly for the poor expectedunder the PRSP, will improve the general living standards ofthe people, reducing poverty on a more sustainable basis.High Growth Scenario: The high economicdevelopment scenario envisages an early achievement of aIasting peace and accelelated implementation of policyadjustments and structural reforms, supported by a strongnational consensus on major economic, political and socialissues of the country and strict adherence to law and order.These would enable the country to meet the requirementsunder the donor supported programmes in time, improving",

Under-thisscenario, achieving a faster economic growth of over 7 percent with stability is possible, thus helping to raise the averageincome at a faster rate, reduce unemployment, and alleviatepoverty more swiftly than in the baseline scenario. Similarly,achievement of the medium-term fiscal targets envisaged inthe FMRA would be faster and the resilience of the economywould be stronger under this scenario, than in the baselinescenaflo.Low Growth Scenario: In this scenario it is assumedthat the ceasefire remains, but no further progress is achievedin the peace process, and only a f'ew policy adjustments andstructural reforms are implemented, with long delays. Thesewould lead to postponement or even cancellation of at leastsome of the concessionary programmes providing foreignassistance. Under this scenario, economic growth woulddecline to below 4 per cent, worsening the basic existingeconomic problems such as inflation, unemployment andpoverty, leading to economic, political and social instability rnthe country. The budget deficit and public debt would rise,increasing the risk of a debt crisis, The external sector woulddeteriorate, recording a deficit in the BOP and hence depletingexternal reserves and raising pressures on the exchange rate,leading to a vicious circle between inf'lation and exchange rate.Consequently, the market oriented economic policy regimewould be difficult to continue and policy makers may becompelled to resort to non-market instruments such as controlsand quotas, including foreign exchange controls, importcontrols and quota systems for distribution of importedessential goods,Worst Case Scenario: This scenario is based on theunfortunate possibility of a resumption of hostilities, andreversals in economic policy adjustments and structuralreforms. Under this scenario economic growth would declinebelow the population growth or even suff'er a contraction andconcessional fbleign assistance would be not available frommost donors. Inflation would accelerate, leading tohyperinflation or compelling the introduction of price controls,creating black markets, Rising unemployment and worseningpoverty would increase the risk of social unrest and politicalcrisis within a short period. A debt crisis would be almostinevitable, with a rising fiscal deficit and economic glowthdeclining below real interest ratesr . A widening currentaccount deficit and declining capital inflows would reduceextemal reserves to a dangerously low level and depreciate theexchange rate sharply.

Meanwhile, increasing productivity and reducingcosts by removing transport barriers would help to contain costpush-inflation, fufther supporting price stability. Peace wouldalso facilitate fiscal consolidation, reducing defenceexpenditure requirements and encouraging more concessionalforeign assistance even to cover a large part of thereconstruction and rehabilitation expenditure. Falling def'enceimports, together with increasing exports, tourism, foreigninvestment and aid disbursement under a peacefulenvironment would enable the realisation of a surplus in theBOP and hence enhance external reserves, strengthenexchange rate stability and reduce external vulnerability.Rising production, decreasing transport costs, an improvingfiscal position and strengthening external assets wouldfacilitate monetary management, enabling interest rates to bereduced and low intlation to be achieved on a more sustainablebasis. The availability of these economic benefits to the public,in tum, would strengthen the peace process, political stabilityand social harmony, Thus, peace and sustainable high qualityeconomic growth are interrelated, reinforcing each other intheir implementation process.Political Stability: Political stability is essential forimproving investor confidence and effective implementationof policy adjustments and structural reforms. Investor surveysin many countries have indicated that both domestic andforeign investors give more weight to political stability thantax concessions in selecting their investment destinations. Inthe recent past, Sri Lanka has had at least one election (i,e.prestdential, parliamentary, provincial council or localgovernment) almost every two years. Elections are necessaryfor the activation of democratic political systems. However,elections every year or two not only increase fiscalexpenditure, but also create political uncertainty, discouraginginvestment, weakening macroeconomic management anddelaying the implementation of structural reforms.

Therefore, bold reforms are necessary toaddress these issues effectively, enabling the development ofinfrastructure facilities. In this endeavour, the activeparticipation of the private sector in infrastructuredevelopment is critical as public sector investment isconstrained by severe fiscal limitations. such private sectorparticipation would also be helpful in improving efficiency inthe supply of infrastructure facilities. changing the role of thepublic sector from a 'player' to a ,referee' has to be a majorpillar in these reforms.

Thus, in orderto ensure 8 per cent annual GDP growth, power generation hasto be expanded annually at least by about 12 per cent. This isa difficult challenge compared with the average annual growthof electricity generation during the last twenty years, whichwas about 7.0 per cent, but is not impossible to achieve. As thesupply of adequate and uninterrupted power at competitivecosts is critical for long-term investment and growth, theunbundling of the cEB should be canied out without furtherdelay and locations for the proposed large generation plantsmust be identified to commence their construction early.Transport: Available transport facilities are notadequate to support a high economic growth, The roadnetwork has been not expanded adequately and even theexisting roads have not been properly maintained. Traffic hasbecome a serious problem in almost all major cittes.Similarly, the public passenger transport sector has beenexperiencing capacity limitations as well as low servicequality. These problems in the transport sector adverselyaffect the overall economic growth by discouraginginvestment and constraining productivity improvement. Theyalso have an adverse impact on poverty by restricting theaccess of the poor to markets and basic social services. Acomprehensive road development programme, consisting ofthe rehabilitation of existing roads and the construction ofexpressways to connect major cities and production areas, isnecessary in order to expand and integrate the domesticmarkets. The government has realised the necessity for roaddevelopment and has prepared a comprehensive programme.In this context, promoting private sector participation infinancing, building, operating and maintaining the roadnetwork is necessary to ensure efficiency and mobiliseadequate financial resources, as available governmentresources are very limited, Similarly, major reforms arenecessary in the public passenger transport system coveringboth bus transport and railway transport. Reforms in theRegional Transport Companies (RTCs) have to be plannedcarefully, as a number of reform initiatives implementedpreviously have not been successful. These companies havebeen depending heavily on budgetary resources to cover eventheir running expenses. Thus, they do not have resources toexpand their capacity or improve service quality.

Ongoing reforms and Iiberalisation have improvedfinancial system stability, efficiency and competitiveness.Nevertheless, intermediation costs and non-perfolming assetratios continue to remain relatively high, compared with othercountries, and have risen above the desirable levels. while thedomestic private debt market has not been developedadequately.

The cost of suchfailures is being borne by the people, especially the low-income people, of the country. When the rest of the worldmoved forward faster, Sri Lanka chose to be a laggard. Asimilar situation that has posed this hard choice to Sri Lankahas arisen today.
