ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, OUTLOOK, ISSUES AND POLICIES

1.1 Introduction

In 2003, Sri Intka nrude further progress itt its march to econontic recovery ancl stability through ct corttirtuatiortof sound ntecroeconomic policies and a further deepening of structural refornts, This wos supported by u

favourable envirorunent resulting from the confidence built by the continuation of the ceusefire, a grctclual

improvement in the world econonxy and increased internutional support for the countrlt. The improved

nlocroeconomic monagement was basically centred uround adtlressirtg key policy oreos, viz., tlrc continurfiion of

fiscal consolidation, prudent monetary policy and a well functioning independently flouting exchange rate system.

These were reinforced by a significunt headway that wus made in broadening and deepening structural reforms.In order to support rehabilitatiort and reconstruction activity ancl to facilitate econontic reforms antl policy

adiustments aimed at laying the foundation for long-term economic growth in cm cttntosphere of peace und

harmony, the international conununity pledged a substantial amount of highly concessional financing facilities for

the country. The econonly respondecl to these stimuli positively, firming growth, reducing unentployment, irnproving

price stability and strengthening the econonty's resilience in ubsorbing externul shocks. AII in ull, Sri Lanka is

should be built through a series of wide and conlinued public discussiorts and awareness progr(ilnntes. This nutkesit incuntbent on all segments of society, such as politicians, bureaucruts, the business cotlununity, civil society,

acetdemia ancl the ntedia, to support and pursue the initiative vigorously, Any failure in this regard would cause

Sri kutka to niss another opportunity of achieving the interrelatecl twfu objectives of pecLce and high quulity

econonic growth.

On the economic policy front, an overall improvementwas observed in 2003. Monetary policy continued to balancejudiciously the two objectives, viz., ensufing sustainable lowinflation, while facilitating economic recovery. This wasfurther supported by the continuation of the independentlyfloating exchange rate system, which has served well since itsintroduction in 2001 by absorbing a part of the pressure fiomlarger than expected foreign currency inflows. In theimplementation of this policy stance, the Central Bank cut itspolicy rates cautiously to encourage investments and usedactive open market operations to sterilise the excess rupee

liquidity resulting from the build up of external reserves. Thelatter helped the Central Bank to contain the expansion ofreserve money within the programme targets. Meanwhile,

steps were taken to strengthen further the market olientationin implementing monetary policy: active open market

The Central Bankis taking a range of further measures to broaden monetarypolicy instruments and improve the policy transmissionmechanism through improvement in the soundness of thefinancial system. Steps were also taken to improve thestability, saf'ety and efflciency of the payments and settlements

system.

The success of the monetary policy stance was ensuredby a complementary fiscal policy regime, which aimedprimarily at fiscal consolidation, compatible with the medium-term sustainable fiscal strategy envisaged in the FiscalManagement (Responsibility) Act (FMRA). Accordingly,measures were taken to enhance government revenuemobilisation through an improvement in tax policy, coupledwith a better tax administration. At the same time, on theexpenditure side, the growth in recurrent expenditure wascontained by checking the expansion in the wage bill, defenceexpenditure and transfer payments. Action was also taken tocheck the sharp growth of the unfunded pension liability of thegovernment by bringing new recruits to the governmentservice under a contributory pension scheme. The abuse ofwelfare programmes by the undeserving, thereby burdeningthe taxpayers, was to be checked by designing a new overallwelfare programme under the Welfare Benefit Law. Publicexpenditure allocation was improved by minimising lowpriority rupee funded capital expenditure, In financing thereduced deficit, the main emphasis was placed on concessionalforeign borrowing in order to release more domestic financialresources to the private sector, which was identified as thedriving force in accelerating economic growth and creatingproductive employment. The first Mid Year Fiscal PositionReport submitted by the Ministry of Finance in terms of theFMRA made a comprehensive evaluation of the progress infiscal operations and highlighted the additional measures,particularly revenue measures, needed for keeping the budget

on track, even though some of them could not be implementedin time due to delays in legislation. Policies improving debt

management, such as replacing high cost short-telm debt withlong-term low-cost debt, extending the maturity of Treasurybonds, and prudent Treasury cash management werecontinued, helping to reduce interest costs below the originalbudgetary estimates,A significant headway was made on various areas in thestructural reforms agenda [oo, e.g., by opening public sectormonopolies to market competition (petroleum and

telecommunications), amending legislation (particularly lawsrelating to the labour market and the financial system) andproposing a three year civil service reform linked to a public

sector wage increase. Long overdue amendments to the labourlaws streamlining settlement of disputes, eliminatingrestrictions on overtime wolk by women and increasingpenalties for child'labour were implemented. Additional labourcourts and tribunals were established. A mandatorycompensation formula for retrenched workers was announcedand an unemployment insurance scheme was being preparedto facilitate the implementation of labour market reforms. Thepreviously mentioned improvements in macroeconomicmanagement and the deepening of structural reforms created

a conducive environment for-economic recovery, by increasinginvestor confidence, encouraging foreign inflows andenhancing donor assistance. These measures also helped to lay

the foundation for a long-term sustainable high quality

economic growth.There was a widespread positive response from theeconomy to the measures adopted. On the production side, allmajor sectors, particularly paddy, manufacturing, trade,telecommunications, financial services, tourism, port andaviation, and construction, contributed to the acceleration ofgrowth, with a 5.9 per cent growth being recorded in GrossDomestic Product (GDP) and a 6,4 per cent growth in GrossNational Product (GNP). Meanwhile, on the demand side, arecovery in exports and a pick-up in investments added to thecontinuing consumer confidence. Capital fbrmation pickedup, increasing to 22.3 per cent of GDP, particularly duringthe second half, recording increases in both public andplivate investment, The increased economic growth and therecovery in investment created more productive jobopportunities in the private sector, reducing unemployment,although it still remains high at 8.4 per cent. National savingsgrew by 1.8 percentage points to 21.3 per cent of GDP,reducing the domestic resource gap (i.e., investment minussavings), as a result of improved incomes of the people,increased remittances and reduced current account deficit in

the budget, It is encouraging that inflation declined at a fasterpace than expected to 2.6 - 6.3 per cent, depending on theprice index, adjusting, after a long period, inflationaryexpectations downward, which is necessary to achievesustainable low inf'lation.On the fiscal front, despite a large revenue shorttall, the

budget deficit declined to 8.0 per cent of GDP, due to eft'ectiveexpenditure containment measures; the realised deficithowever, was higher than budgeted. Increased economicgrowth and the reduced budget deficit together contained therising trend in the public debt to GDP ratio. The reduceddeflcit and increased fbreign financing reduced governmentnet domestic borrowing significantly (about Rs. 47 billion),enabling the government to repay some of its existing debt tothe banking sector, thereby releasing more resources to theprivate sector. Meanwhile, public corporations too reducedtheir borrowings in 2003, Leducing the overall public sectorborrowing requirement by Rs. 54 billion and hence facilitatingthe downward adjustment in interest rates, Thus, the fiscal

sector achievements clearly indicate favourable movementstowards the targets in the FMRA, although they were belowexpectations.During 2003, the external sector was further strengthenedwith a recovery in exports and a continuation of the growth in

tourism, port services, worker remittances and private capitalinflows. Despite increased petroleum prices, the terms of tradeimproved by 7.4 per cent in f'avour of Sri Lanka. The cunentaccount deficit in the balance of payments (BOP) as a ratio of

GDP declined to 0.6 per cent, while the overall BOP recordeda surplus (US dollars 502 million) for the third consecutive

year. Consequently, extemal reserves of the country improved

term external debt to external reserves decreased, reducing

external sector vulnerability and strengthening stability in thefoleign exchange market.

On the monetary front, money supply grew (M2h by 15.3per cent) in line with expectations, despite the high reserveaccumulation, which causes it to rise faster. The decliningpublic sector credit utilisation enabled accommodating theexpanding private sector demand for credit without raising

money supply, thereby suppofting the economic recovery. The

domestic money market remained liquid and the yield curveshifted gradually downward, reflecting reductions in most

interest rates, although some lending rates adjusted relativelyslowly. Nevertheless, the interest spread between lending rates

and deposit rates remained high, though decreasing marginallyduring the last quarter, emphasising the necessity for

accelerating financial sector reforms, increasing competitionin the tlnancial markets and expanding information availableto the public. Reflecting increased corporate sectorprofitability and improved business confidence, theperformance of the stock market showed a record

improvement. A long-term reference yield curve emerged withthe issue of long tenor government debt instruments,facilitating future developments in the domestic debt mal'ket.Even though achievements in 2003 are encouraging,much more needs to be done to achieve a sustainable highquality growth, resolving basic economic problems on a more

Despite recent imptovements, major economic problems such

as widespread poverty, high structural unemployment, serious

under employment and relatively high inflation continue toloom large, throwing up challenges to policy makers.Similarly, some major underlying issues still remarn

unresolved and without being addressed effectively. These areinadequate and volatile economic growth, inadequate

investment and savings, low productivity improvement, thecontinuation of high fiscal deficits causing a heavy debt

burden, inadequate infrastructure facilities and relatively high

interest spread with low financial deepening.

Looking ahead, Sri Lanka's future prospects of achieving

a sustainable high economic growth appear to be pr-omising,

provided the downside risks are mitigated. The risks arise

mainly from the'failure to pursue the peace initiative and the

abrogation midway of the needed structural reforms tbr laying

the toundation for a sustainable high quality long-term growth.With these essential elements in place, it is necessary tocontinue with the pursuit of sound macroeconomlc

management, supported by the development of intl'astlucturefacilities, particularly power and transport, improvement inlaw and oLder, strengthening of political stability, effectiveutilisation of foreign donor assistance and harnessing the

emerging favourable external environment for the beneflt of

the country. The last requires that Sri Lanka, as a small open

cannot be overemphasised. The favourable world economicprospects and strong international support have off'ered anideal opportunity for the country to take major steps in thisdirection in 2004. If the country misses this opportunity, thecost would be unbearably high.

1.2 International Environment

The recovery in the global economy, which is crucial for SriLanka to sustain its economic grcwth, continued at a faster ratedunng 2003 than in2002. World outpur grew by 3.9 per centin 2003 in comparison to 3.0 per cent in 2002. A highergrowth in the two largest economies, namely, the US andJapan, and the continuation of growth momentum in Asianemerging market economies, largely contributed to thisrecovery. The US economy grew by 3.1 per cent during 2003compared to 2.2 per cent in 2002. An accommodativemonetary policy, coupled with an expansionary fiscal policyimplemented since 2001 against a background of economic

tecession, helped the recovery in the US economy, However,the emergence of significantly large twin deficits (i.e,, fiscaldeficit and external current account deficit) in the US hasposed downside nsks that might affect the current recovery.Japan also recorded a faster recovery by growing at anestimated 2.7 per cent from a negative 0.3 per cent in 2002.Strong global recovery and low levels of inventories helpedthe recovery in Japan. However, weaknesses in the Japanesecorporate and banking sectors still remain, posing downsiderisks to a sustainable recovery. Meanwhile, the slowdown inthe Euro area continued for the third consecutive year. TheEuro area recorded an estimated growth of 0.4 per cent in2003, down from 0,9 per cent in2002. Apparently, exportsfrom the Euro area could not grow along with the globalrecovery, owing to the sharp appreciation of the euro.Investment spending too remained weak owing to weaknessesin corporate balance sheets.Emerging market economies in Asia continued to be thefastest growing region despite uncertainties related to the Iraqwar, surging oil prices at the beginning of the year andsubsequently, the impact of the Severe Acute RespiratorySyndrome (SARS) epidemic. Emerging Asia grew by 7.2 percent in 2003 in comparison to 6.2 per cent growth in2002.However, newly industrialised Asian economies recorded alower growth (3.0 per cent), while South Asia grew at a fasterrate (7.0 per cent), ASEAN-4r also grew at a marginally

higher rate of 5.0 per cent in 2003 compared to a 4.3 per centgrowth in 2002. While the net external demand continued toplay a key role in the economic growth in Asia, domesticdemand played a greater role in 2003, as most emergingmarket economies in Asia adopted domestic demand ledgrowth strategies. A notable feature in Asian economies in2003 was the rapid build up of external reserves and theeffective real depreciation of currencies. This exerted someinternational pressure for greater flexibility in exchange ratemanagement in the region, particularly on the countries thathave been following fixed exchange rate regimesInflation bottomed out in 2002 and increased marginallyin both advanced economies and developing countries mainlydue to the effects of the stimulating macroeconomic policiesimplemented in recent years and the rise in oil prices.Meanwhile, world trade has also been estimated to have grownat a higher rate at 4.5 per cent in 2003 than in2002 (3.1 percent), owing to the recovery in advanced economies, but is stillbelow the annual average growth of 6.9 per cent recorded in the1990s. Both exports from and imports to advanced countries,

and emerging market and developing countnes grew at a higherrate in 2003 than in2002.In the international commoditymarket, petroleum prices rose sharply by 15.8 per cent in 2003,compared with a 2.5 per cent increase in 2002 and a 13.8 per

cent decrease in 2001. Non-fuel commodity prices increased by7.1 per cent in 2003 compared with a 0.5 per cent increase in2002. This large difference in commodity price increases raisedthe trade deficit in oil importing developing countries, resultingin challenges in managing the external sector balance. Terms oftrade improved by 0.1 per cent in favour of developingcountries during the year. The risk of raising barriers onintemational trade in advanced countries receded in 2003 withthe removal of restrictions on steel imports by the USA, but thefailure to reach a consensus at the WTO meetings would limitthe potential benefits of liberalisation and integrated markets.International financial markets experienced ampleliquidity during 2003 in a historically low interest rareenvironment, which also reduced the margins of lending.Improved US corporate earnings and reduced geopoliticaluncertainties led to a strong rebound in mature equity markets.In emerging markets, financial conditions improved further,aided by low interest rates in industrial countries, whichfacilitated bond issuances by emerging markets. Net capitalinflows to emerging market economies have also beenestimated to exceed US dollars l3l billion. the highest suchinflows since 1997. In the foreign exchange market, the USdollar continued to depreciate sharply in 2003 against othermajor currencies (e.g., 19.9 per cent, ll.0 per cent and 10.8per cent, respectively, against the euro, UK pound andJapanese yen, respectively), following similar sharpdepreciations in 2002, reflecting the impact of growing

macroeconomic imbalances among industrial countries. TheUS dollar depreciated by 29.7 per cent against the euro, 18.6

per cent against the UK pound and 18.6 per cent against the

Japanese yen during the two year period of 2002-2003, This

was a reversal of the appreciation of the US dollar recordedagainst the same currencies in2000-2001; 13.9 per cent

against the euro, 11.6 per cent against the UK pound and 28.5

per cent against the Japanese yen. Such large fluctuations inthe cross rates among major international currencies createdifficulties, particularly for developing countries like SriLanka which are increasingly integrating to the global

economy. This underscored the need for further strengthening

macroeconomic policy coordination among major industrial

countries and improving surveillance by the IMF.The recovery in the global economy, in particular in theUS and Japan, which are major markets for Sri Lanka'sexports, had a direct beneficial impact on Sri Lanka'sindustrial production and exports. It also helped to swell theinflow of tourists to Sri Lanka to a record level in 2003. Ingeneral, international price movements were in Sri Lanka's

tavour, improving the terms of trade, although the high pricesof petroleum products were detrimental to Sri Lanka.

L.3 Output, Demand and SectoralPerformance

Economic recovery in Sri Lanka, which commenced in 2002,continued in 2003 to post a broad based 5.9 per cent realeconomic growth, benefitting from favourable domesticfactors and external environment. All four quarters in 2003

recorded a growth rate of over 5 per cent indicating that therecovery was continuous, Meanwhile, all three production

sectors, i.e., Agriculture, Industry and Services, recordedpositive growth rates reflecting that the growth was broad

based. Similarly, growth was supported by all three demandcomponents, with strong consumet demand, expansion ininvestment activity and recovery in exports. Irrcreasedcorporate sector profitability and upward trends in sectoral

price indices in the Colombo Stock Exchange also confirmedthe broad based economic recovery recorded in 2003.Economic growth, particularly growth in agriculture, trade,

tourism and construction, raised the income of a large numberof people, distributing the benefits of growth among various

segments of society and all parts of the island.On the production side, the Services sector, accountingfor about 55 per cent of the economy, grew by 7.1 per cent in

2003 upgrading its 6. I per cent growth in 2002, and reflecting

its ability to recover fast. As in the previous years, this sector

was the largest contributor to annual growth, accounting for

about 70 per cent of the growth. The high growth momentumin the trade, transport, telecommunication, tourism and

financial subsectors helped the continuation of the recorded

high growth in the Services sector. The faster growth of the

Services sector, which increased its relative share in the Sri

Lankan economy, is in line with the normal trend that has been

observed in the development process of a country. With thediversification and modernisation of economic activities, the

Services sector expands faster as it has to play a greater rolein all three basic economic activities (i.e., production,distribution and consumption), facilitating intermediation

among economic agents and flow of resources as well as

products within an integrated economic system, and satisfyingincreased consumer demand for services (Box 6). TheIndustrial sector. accounting for about 27 per cent of the

economy, grew by 5.5 per cent in 2003, compared with a lowgrowth of 1.0 per cent in2002. The continuation of the growthmomentum in factory industry and the recovery in the powergeneration and construction subsectors from their negativegrowth rates in 2002 helped to increase the industrial sectorcontribution to the annual economic growth from about 7 percent in 2002 to 25 per cent in 2003. Despite the record paddyharvest and the recovery in coconut production, theAgriculture sector, which accounts for about l9 per cent of theGDP, recorded a lower growth rate of 1.5 per cent in 2003compared with 2.5 per cent in2002.It contributed about 5 per

cent of the annual economic growth. Negative growth rates infishing and tea production were mainly responsible for thedeceleration of agricultural sector growth. The continuation ofa low growth rate clearly reflects the existing structuralweaknesses in the agriculture sector and reiterates thenecessity for strong reforms to raise productivity and improveits resilience, rather than continuing to rely on unsustainable

and distortionary input subsidies, ad hoc tariff protection andinefficient intervention in agricultural marketing activities bythe government.On the ilemand side, the continuation of domesticconsumer confidence and growth momentum in tourismprovided the major impetus to economic growth in 2003, Therelative share of consumption in the aggregate demandremained high, at about 84 per cent, due to the rising privateconsumer demand that offset the declining governmentconsumption as demanded by the ongoing fiscal consolidationstrategy. Domestic consumption at constant prices rose by 6.1per cent in 2003 benefitting from rising average per capita realincome and increasing tourist arrivals, which rose by 27 per

cent. Domestic investment, which displayed a renewed growthmomentum towards the end of the year, reflecting the

translation of increased investor confidence into realinvestment activities, grew by l7 per cent in real terms andaccounted for about 42 per cent of the growth in domesticaggregate demand. Meanwhile, the recovery in exports,benefitting from high world economic growth and improvedtrade relations with Sri Lanka's trading partners, particularlywith India, EU and USA, added growth impetus to the demand

side in 2003. Declining interest rates that resulted from growthsupportive monetary policy in a background of deceleratinginflation and improving fiscal consolidation, supportedeconomic growth on both the production and the demand sidesby reducing the cost of credit.Despite the increased aggregate demand, inflation

decelerated due to increased supply of domestically produced

food crops, the continuation of a cautious monetary policy andstability in the exchange rate. On the supply side, bothdomestic production, and import of goods and non-factor

services expanded in 2003, increasing the availability of goods

and services in the domestic market and reducing the pressureon prices. The supply of domestically produced goods and

services grew by 5,9 per cent and accounted for about 52 per

cent of the annual increase in the aggregate supply. The importcategory grew at 10.4 per cent and accounted for about 48 per

cent of the overall supply expansion in 2003.In 2003, GDP at current market prices rose by ll.2 per

cent to Rs.1,760 billion (US dollars 18.2 billion), while GNP

rose to Rs.1,737 billion (US dollars 18.0 billion). This increasein nominal terms was a combined outcome of a 5.9 per centgrowth in real terms and a 5.0 per cent increase in prices.

Thus, GDP in real terms grew at a higher rate than originallyprojected (5.5 per cent), but the lower increase in prices thanexpected at the beginning of the year (7.0 per cent), resultedin a lower increase in GDP at current market prices than

originally expected (12.8 per cent)r . Mid-year population roseby 1.3 per cent to 19.3 million in 2003. Consequently, theaverage per capita GDP in nominal terms rose by 9.8 per centto Rs.91,434. Given the lower inflation rate at 5.0 per cent asmeasured by the increase in the GDP deflator, this indicates animprovement in the average per capita income in real terms by4.6 per cent. In US dollar terms, per capita GDP rose by 8,8per cent to US dollars 947, outperforming the previous highestvalue of US dollars 899 in 2000.Several factors contributed to increasing economicgrowth and improving price stability in 2003. The first and themost important factor was the continuation of the ceasefiredespite a temporary stalling of the peace process. On theproduction side, the resulting peaceful environment helped toincrease activities in all major production sectors. In theagricultural sector, it helped to expand cultivated areas, andincrease yields with the availability of inputs and expandedaccess to the market. Increased transport and distributionfacilities, particularly in the North and the East, helped thegrowth in the industrial sector as well as in the services sector.On the demand side, it contributed to growth throughexpanding domestic markets, facilitating movement of goods

and people, increasing investment, raising tourist arrivals andexpanding rehabilitation and reconstruction work. These gainsfrom the continuation of the ceasefire clearly demonstrate thepotentially immense benefits from a sustainable peace andhence, the necessity of achieving a long-term solution to theNorth-East issue. Secondly, despite the mid-year floods andthe dry weather conditions that prevailed towards the end ofthe year, weather conditions were generally favourable in2003, contributing to growth in agriculture and electricitygeneration. Thirdly, recovery in the world economy supportedthe economic growth through increased demand for SriLanka's exports and high growth in tourism. Fourthly, theimprovements in macroeconomic management that caused adownward shift in the interest rate structure and an improvedliquidity position in the domestic market brought aboutstability in the financial markets under the floating exchangerate regime. Furthermore, the implementation of structuralreforms addressing the deep-rooted weaknesses also had abeneficial impact on the economy. Fifthly, the stronginternational support for the peace process and the economicreforms helped accelerate the economic growth. The finaloutcome of the international support was the pledge of arecord level of concessionary assistance (about US dollars 4.5billion for 2003-2006) to develop the whole country,particularly to build the badly needed infrastructure facilities,and implement the rehabilitation and reconstruction activitiesin the war atfected areas.Agriculture : Despite relatively favourable weatherconditions and the continuation of the recovery in the overall

economy, the growth rate in the Agriculture sectordecelerated in 2003, reflecting the weak dynamism in thesector due to deep-rooted structural weaknesses. Agriculturesector growth has remained significantly lower than thegrowth in the Industrial and Services sectors over the past

decades. During the period 1977 -2003, its annual averagegrowth was 2.6 per cent, compared with 5.4 per cent in theServices and 5.3 per cent in the Industrial sector, Thedeteriorating state managed agricultural extension services,inadequate availability of high yielding seed varieties, highpost-harvest losses, marketing problems, restrictions in theland market and the continuation of distortionary governmentinterventions are the major issues that need to be addressedurgently, The effective resolution of these issues through amarket based sustainable strategy is necessary to ensure ahigh growth in the Agriculture sector. Such a strategy in theAgricultural sector has to be a major pillar in resolving thehigh unemployment and widespread poverty in the country,as agriculture still directly accounts for about 35 per cent ofemployment and is the major economic activity in the ruralareas where about 90 per cent of the poor live.In 2003, the output of paddy, coconut, rubber, sugar,vegetables and fruits increased. However, output in tea, someminor-export crops and a few other field crops declined.Reflecting their combined effect, the value added in theAgriculture sector increased only by 1.5 per cent in 2003.Within the plantation crops, tea production declined from therecord output of 310 million kgin2002 to 303 million kg dueto the adverse eff'ect of the mid-year floods and earthslips onIow grown tea and the excessive rain on high grown teaproducing areas. However, reflecting the built-in resilience ofthe smallholder tea producers, the low grown tea recoveredfaster and managed to contain the fall at 0,9 per cent in 2003,compared with a much larger decline of 6.2 per cent in highgrown tea, The dry spell experienced at the end of the yearaffected production in all three elevations. Tea exportsincreased due to a higher rundown of stocks. Reflecting afavourable trend, the share of bulk tea in total tea exportsdeclined to 59 per cent in 2003 from 64 per cent in 2002 dueto the continued efforts to increase the export of value addedtea, such as tea packets, tea bags and instant tea. The averageprice at the Colombo Auction declined marginally, a corollaryof increased world tea production and the oversupply due tothe interruption of tea exports to the Middle East in early 2003during the war in Iraq, Meanwhile, the cost of production

increased by about 9.3 per cent, mainly due to an increase inthe cost of inputs, such as wages, fuel and fertiliser, reducingthe producer margin, which was already low at about l5 per

cent. In this situation, plantation management companies faceddifficulties, particularly in undertaking new investments,Benefitting from attractive prices, which rose by about 49

per cent at the Colombo Auctions, rubber production increased

as producers brought even marginal cultivations under tapping.However, the large number of rainy days and the severe mid-

year floods limited the output growth to 1.6 per cent in 2003.The average yield remained low at around 9ll kg per ha,compared with yields in other major producing countries such

as Thailand (1,531 kg/ha) and Malaysia (1,047 kg/ha), mainlydue to poor use of rain guards, inadequate application offeltiliser, poor use of high yielding clones, non adherence tosystematic infilling and scarcity of tappers. Sheet rubberproduction glew by 17 per cent, raising its share to 54 per centin total rubber production, reflecting a shifting away ofproducers from crepe rubber production due to increasingprice differences in favour of sheet rubber. Despite a marginalincrease in production, rubber exports declined due to a high

domestic demand from the growing rubber basedmanufacturing industries. In fact, rubber imports increased to

meet growing domestic manufacturing sector demand. Thecontinuation of attractive rubber plices since early 2002,resulting in a high producer margin of about 60 per cent,encouraged investment in new rubber cultivation.Coconut production grew by 7 per cent in 2003. to 2,562million nuts, a turnaround after two years, reflecting the laggedeffect of improved weather conditions in 2002 and the highfertiliser application encouraged by attractive producermargins, over and above the increased production costs,However, the production was well below the peak of 3,096nuts in 2000. Exports of coconut kernel products increased in

2003 benetitting from the increased nut production. However,

coconut oil production, which declined by 53 per cent in2002,dlopped further by 58 per cent in 2003 due to strongcompetition from imported edible oils. The removal of theimport duty surcharge in 2002 and a reduction of tariffs in2003 increased the competitiveness of imported edible oilprices in the domestic market. A long-term, clear tariff policywould be helpful in encouraging private investment in the

coconut sector.During the 2003 cultivation year, paddy productionincreased by 7.3 per cent, reaching a record level of 3.07million metric tons, surpassing the previous peak output of2,86 million metric tons recorded in 2000 by 7 per cent. BothMaha and Yala seasons reported the best output on record,registering output increases of 6.8 and 8.3 per cent,respectively. This was entirely due to an expansion rncultivation area as the annual average yield declined by 3.4 percent owing to cultivation of marginal lands. The continuationof the ceasefire enabling the cultivation of paddy land in thewar affected areas in the North and the East, and improvedwater availability, mainly contributed to a 15.3 per centincrease in the cultivated area. It is noteworthy that all thedistricts in the Northern Province recorded production

increases and accounted for about 7 per cent of the total Mahaoutput. Paddy prices dropped during the harvest seasons, butremained at higher levels, well above the cost of production,

than in the previous year. In a counter strategy, the specificimport duty on rice was raised from Rs.5 to Rs.7 per kilogramin March and further to Rs.9 in August to minimise downwardpressure on paddy prices. As the increased domesticproduction was almost sufficrent to meet the total domestic

demand, rice imports declined sharply to 35,000 metric tonsin 2003.Despite a decline in 2002 and 2003, the average paddyyield remained at a higher level compared even with some ofrice exporting Asian countries such as Thailand, Pakistan, thePhilippines and Myanmar (Box 8), Meanwhile, domesticpaddy prices remained generally at a higher level than the

equivalent import prices. These two thctors together indicatethat the low income of domestic paddy farmers has been notdue to lower yield or uneconomical farmgate prices, but

mainly due to other factors such as increasing fragmentationof the land holdings which denies the benefit of economies of

scale, high post harvest losses, low output quality and high

cost of production mainly due to the scarcity of labour duringcultivation and harvesting seasons. Therefbre, improvementsin the land market, reduction in post-harvesI losses,improvement in output quality and mechanisation ofcultivation are more important measures in developing paddycultivation on a long-term sustainable basis, rather thanplacing heavy reliance on distortionary and unsustainableinput subsidies, ad hoc tariff adjustments, inefficient outputmarket interventions by the public sector, and cancellation ofagricultulal loans.In the minor export crop category, except cloves, whichwas aff'ected by mid-year floods, all major crops recordedincreases in output, Cinnamon, the largest crop in thiscategory, recorded an 8 per cent production increase. In theother agriculture sector, catering mainly to the domesticmarket, output increases were recorded in most varieties offruits and vegetables, Sugar production increased by 42 percent due to implovement in efficiency following theprivatisation of Sevanagala and Pelwatte sugar fhctories andcultivations. However, potato, onion and chillie productiondeclrned in 2003 despite continuation of high importprotection through specific duties. The continued cultivationof potato in the same lands for a number of seasons, withoutclop rotation, mainly due to the attractive local prices arisingfrom high import protection, adversely affected potatoproduction, reducing yields, reflecting the unexpected cost ofhigh protection in agriculture.Fish production declined by 5.4 per cent, reversing themoderate -qrowth recorded in 2002. This was entirely due to adecline of 6.8 per cent in marine fish production, whichaccounts for about 89 per cent of total fish production of thecountry, as inland and aquaculture fish production recorded an

increase of 7 .6 per cent. Even though the prohibition of the useof some fishing gear has been identified as a reason for thisdecline, the fisheries sector growth has been constrained by a

series of regulations and restrictions discouraging large scaleprivate investment, particularly in deep sea fishing. Reflectingthe combined effect of reduced production and increaseddomestic demand, fish prices rose in 2003.In the livestock sector, milk production rose by 2 per

cent, but the domestic production was sufficient to meet onlyl5 per cent of the country's demand, resulting in heavy

reliance on imports, mainly powdered milk. Initiatives takenso far to expand the domestic dairy industry have not beensuccessful. Benefitting from the increased demand,particularly with the booming tourist industry, poultry meatproduction recorded an increase of 3.6 per cent in 2003,compared with the production in 2002.Industry: The Industry sectorr , which recorded a slowerrecovery of 1.0 per cent in2002 compared with the other two

sectors, grew faster in 2003, recording a 5.5 per cent annual

growth. The recovery was widespread with an annual growth

rate of over 3.5 per cent in all four major sectors (i.e., Mining

and quarrying, Manufacturing, Construction and Electricity,

gas and water), raising their contribution to the overall GDPgrowth in 2003. The growth has come from both the pdvateand public sectors, but the private sector, which has an

increasing relative share in the Industry sector, contributed

more. Increased agricultural production, continuation of theceasefire, recovery in export demand, booming tourism,

favourable weather conditions, declining lending rates and thecontinuation of structural reforms were identified as majorcontributory factors for the industrial sector growth.Reversing the negative growth rate recorded in 2002, theMining and quarrying sector grew by 3.6 per cent in 2003mainly owing to growth in the quarrying subsector (5.5 percent), which responded positively to the demand from theConstruction sector,Meanwhile, the Manufacturing sector, which accounts for'

about 62 per cent of the overall industrial sector, grew by 4.4

per cent, compared with a 2.1 per cent growth in2002. Within

the Manufacturing sector, plantation processing industry turnedaround its negative growth owrng to higher output in coconut

and rubber, but remained at a low rate of 2.2 per cent due to aproduction decline in tea. The annual growth in the small

industries sub-group also increased from 2.1per cent in 2002to 6.1 per cent in 2003 benefitting from the high domestic

demand and booming tourism. Factory industry, the largestsubsector accounting for about 8l per cent of the totalmanufacturing sector, recorded a iastel recovery, with a 4.6 percent growth in 2003 compared with 2.8 per cent in 2002, butwas still well below its potential growth. This increase wasentirely owing to a growth in the private sector industries (5.2

per cent), which account for about 96 per cent of the factory

industries, as the public sector industries recorded a negativegrowth of 8.0 per cent, reflecting the closure of the petroleumrefinery for about one month for routine maintenance work.Both domestic market oriented and export market orientedindustries contributed to the private sector led industrialglowth. A continuation of the growth momentum in consumer

demand, a recovery in investment activity and improvement intransport and distribution in the North helped the growth indomestic market oriented industries, Meanwhile. improvedexport demand contributed to the growth in export-orientedindustries. Despite increased energy costs, manufacturing

sector profitability improved by 2.3 percentage points Io 14.2per cent, reflecting the benefits of improved labourproductivity, declining interest costs, restructuring measuresinvolving cost economisrng and moderation of wage increases,Labour productivity, measured as the average value addition

rn2002, mainly owing to the application of modern technologyand the modernisation of production processes. Capacityutilisation in the manufacturing sector rose by 4.0 percentagepoints to 85 per cent, encouraging new investment activitytowards the end of the year, Consequently, machinery andequipment imports (volume index) recorded a33.1 per centgrowth in 2003 compared with a 17 per cent increase in 2002.Textiles, apparel and leather products, accounting for 40per cent of the total output in factory industries, glew onlyby 2.6 per cent, despite the recovery in the world economy.This clearly reflected increasing competition in theinternational markets for these products from low costproducer countries such as China. The food, beverage andtobacco industdal group, catering mainly to the domesticmarket, recorded a relatively higher growth rate of 6.3 percent owing to a high growth in liquor (12 per cent) and foodprocessing (7.3 per cent) industLies. High growth in rubber

based products (21.8 per cent) and plastic and PVC products(8,5 per cent) helped the annual growth rate of the industrialcategory covering chemical, petroleum, rubber and plasticproducts increasing to 5.0 per cent in 2003. Special facilitiesgranted to Sri Lankan exports to the EU market andappreciation of the euro contributed to high growth in rubberbased products. The recovery in construction activitiessupported the 6.1 per cent growth in the non-metallicindustrial category, consisting of cement, concrete productsand ceramics. The fabricated metal industry grew by 6.7 percent, reflecting mainly the increased demand for agriculturalmachinery, water pumps, steel furniture and electrical items.The paper and paper product industry grew by 4.5 per centand was supported by the demand for packing materials,particularly export oriented industries.The Construction sector, which experienced a setbackduring the past two years, recovered in 2003, recording agrowth rate of 5.5 per cent, and contributed about 6.5 percent to the overall GDP growth. However, the growth wasbelow the original expectation as government capitalexpenditure was cut down by Rs.7.6 billion in the ef'forts tocontain the fiscal deficit. The major growth impetus camefrom the private sector mainly from housing construction.Increased consumer confidence and the availabilit/y offinancial facilities at lower interest rates encouraged privatesector housing construction. Government and publiccorpotation investment expenditure also increased by 46 percent, adding further impetus to the growth in the sector.Meanwhile, some of the rehabilitation and reconstructionwork undertaken in the North and the East, albeit in a limitedway, with external assistance, also contributed to the growth.Construction sector growth momentum was also shown bythe increase in the building material import volume index,which rose by 21.3 per cent in 2003 compared with 3.9 percent in 2002.In the industry sector, the recovery in the Electricity, gasand water sector was notable, recording an annual growth of

21.7 per cent in 2003 compared with a decline of 0.7 per centin2002. The recovery in electricity generation after the power

cuts of the previous year and increased generation of low-cost

hydropower, enhanced the value addition in the power sector.

Consequently, power generation increased by l0 per cent in

2003, while the value addition in electricity rose by 25.3 per

cent as the relative share of hydro power rose [o 43 per centin 2003 from 39 per cent in 2002. The entire increase cametlom the CEB as the private sector share in total generationdeclined to 29 from 35 per cent due to non-renewal ofemergency power purchase agreements. Meanwhile. the totalinstalled capacity increased by l5 per cent to 2,223 MW in2003 with the commissioning of the Kukule Ganga Power

Project (70MW) and a combined cycle power plant owned byAES (Kelanitrssa) Pvt. Ltd., (165 MW). However, this is still

inadequate to meet the fast growing demand for power, The

demand for power grew at a high rate of l3 per cent with theeconomic recovely, increasing power intensity in theeconomy, and expanding consumer base, particularly undetthe rural electrification programme, i.e., 'Deepaloka', Theproportion of households with electricity connectionsincreased to 68 per cent in 2003 from 62 per cent in 2002.Even though there were no power cuts in 2003, seriousproblems in the power sector continued to loom large,adversely affecting the productivity in the economy andinvestor contidence. Large fluctuations in power supply and

regular supply disruptions not only reduced the productivity ofthe economy but also caused damage to sensitive modern

machinery and equipment. Meanwhile, the significantly lower

expansion in power generation capacity in comparison to the

demand, which is growing at over 8 per cent annually, and

delays in implementing low-cost large scale powel projectsincrease the risks of power shottages, discouraginginvestment. Despite the availability of power sectorrestructuring and development plans, including identifiedcapacity expansion projects strongly supported byconcessional donor financing, the implementation has beenslow and relatively inetfective. Unbundling of the CEB as apart of the restructuring process under the separation of the

roles of the government as owner, regulator and operator has

been initiated, but noteworthy progress has not been made.The project proposals for large scale low cost power plants

have been in the pipeline for more than ten yeals without even

the location fbr a single project being finalised yet. Similarly,

despite the availability of concessional donor financing andtechnical assistance, the transmission and distribution is notonly inadequate, but also inefficient, resulting in system lossesstill as high as I9 per cent, more than double the internationalnolm. Therefore, an eff.ective implementation of power sector

reforms and faster action in implementing power projects arecrucial to accelerating economic growth,Despite significant fluctuations in price, localconsumption of LP gas continued to expand in 2003 reflecting

the expanding consumer base due to its convenience and price

advantage over alternative energy sources. A third playerentered the market, expanding the supply capacity andincreasing competition. However, the potential benefit forconsumers from the competition has not yet materialised,reflecting the necessity for a proper regulatory system,

The total volume of water supplied by the National WaterSupply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) increased by 2.0 per

cent to 357 million cubic meters in 2003. The existing capacity

is inadequate to meet the rising demand, while concerns have

been raised regarding the unintenupted availability and qualityof water supply services.Services: The Services sector continued as the maindriving force in the economic recovery. This was enabled bya continuation of the high growth momentum intelecommunications and financial services, and acceleratedrecovery in trade, tourism and port services. Trade was the

largest subsector, accounting for about 22 per cent of GDP and

39 per cent of the Services sector. It grew by 7.3 per cent in2003, benefitting from expansion in both external trade anddomestic trade. The continuation of the ceasefire and

economic recovery provided impetus to domestic and externaltrade services. Meanwhile, increased derived demand forimported intermediate goods and increased demand for capitalgoods with the recovery in investment, supported the growthin import trade. Improved market access in the North and

expanding packaging and trading facilities added additionalimpetus to domestic trade services. The Consumer AffairsAuthority (CAA) has been established to ensure the protectionof consumer rights in a liberalised market environment.

The second largest subsector, i.e,, Transport, storage and

communication, accounting for 13 per cent of the overall GDP

and 24 per cent of the Services sector, accelerated its annualgrowth rate to l0 per cent in 2003 from 7,6 per cent in 2002.Within this sector, telecommunications continued to record

double digit growth (24.5 per cent), reflecting dynamism withgrowing competition among suppliers, expansion of servicesin the North and the East and increasing demand withchanging consumer preference. The subscriber network forfixed access and mobile cellular services increased by 29 percent in 2003 compared with 2I per cent in 2002. This highgrowth was bolstered by the fast expansion in the mobiletelephone market. The subscriber base of fixed accesstelephones increased by 6 per cent, while mobile cellularphone connections rose by 462,000 or 50 per cent (on top of

the 40 per cent increase in2002).Improvements in cellulartelephone technology, aggressive competition, affordableinitial costs, a good supply and expansion of coverage have

been the main reasons for the significantly high growth in themobile phone sector. Internet and e-mail services also

expanded rapidly, recording a22 per cent annual growth in acompetitive market environment with 27 servrce providers.The value addition of the sector has also increased with theexpansion of various value added services bytelecommunication operators. This high performance was

further supported by a continuation of the liberalisation in thetelecommunication industry, the e-Sri Lanka initiative by thegovemment and additional demand in the North. The major

reforms undertaken in 2003 that supported such growth werethe issue of 32licences ending the monopoly of external

gateway operations and finalisation of the tariff rebalancing,

removing the cross subsidy pricing against international calls.

The benefits of these are clearly indicated by a reduction in

charges on international direct dialing (IDD) calls by over 50

per cent in 2003 and increases in subscribers to IDD by 25 per

cent and international outgoing calls. Meanwhile, the still lowtele-densityr in Sri Lanka compared with many countries in

the Asian region indicates considerable potential for further

expansion in this sector. The completion of the project linking

Sri Lanka and India by a microwave link between Talaimannar

and Rameswaram has further expanded the future prospects of

the industry.Port services continued to expand in 2003 accelerating

the growth in value addition in the sector in GDP from 2.4 percent in 2002 to 10,8 per cent in 2003. Both expansion in

domestic container handling by 8 per cent and an increase in

transshipment services by l2 per cent contributed this growth.

Container volume handled at the Colombo Port rose by I I percent to a record level of 1.9 million TEUs. The majorcontributory factors were the recovery in the domestic

economy, high economic growth in India raising demand fortransshipment services, attractive promotional schemesoffered, capacity expansion and productivity improvement.

The number of containers handled per hour increased for mainlines from 24 in2002 to 30 in 2003, while berth efficiencyimproved with a reduction in waiting hours for container

vessels from 1.9 to 0.9 for main lines. These improvementswere clearly reflected in the increased profits of the portservice industry in 2003. Looking forward, furtherimprovements in productivity, capacity expansion in theColombo Port and developments in other ports based on

economic criteria are essential to harness the full benetits ofthe strategic location of Sri Lanka on one of the mainintemational sea routes.Despite the continuation of economic recovery, the valueaddition in the transport sector (in GDP) recorded only a

moderate growth rate of 3.8 per cent, as in the previous year,reflecting deep-rooted structural weaknesses, particularly in

public passenger transpoftation. Passenger and goods transportservices provided by the private sector expanded, with an

increase in the fleet of vehicles. The number of new buses andlorries registered in 2003 increased by 36 per cent and 39 percent, respectively, reflecting continuation of private sectorinvestment in the transport sector. The number of busesoperated by Regional Transport Companies continued to

decline in 2003, and their passenger kilometrage decreased by

The operated train kilometres remained at thesamee level as in the previous year (i.e., 8 million km) whilegoods transportation dropped by 2 per cent, However,passenger kilometerage increased by 4 per cent, reflecting theimpact of significantly cheaper fares compared with bus fares.The capacity and quality of the public sector transportservices, both bus and railway seryices, further deteriorated in2003, while their increasing reliance on government transfersemphasises the necessity for bold reforms.In 2003, the Banking, insurance and real estate sector,accounting for about 9 per cent of overall GDP and 17 per centof the Services sector, grew by 10.6 per cent following an I l.lper cent growth in 2002, reflecting the increasing financialintermediation in the economy and profitability of the financialsector. The major contributory factors for this growth wereincreased business activity, a boom in the Colombo StockExchange, wider interest margins, expansion in insurance andIeasing activities, and developments in the domestic debtmarket. Financial sector reforms, particularly in the state banksand strengthening of regulatory and supervisory systems,continued in 2003, even though progress was slow inrestructuring state banks.Meanwhile, the record arrivals of tourists, exceeding 0.5million, resulted in a high growth of 22 pr cent in the hotelsand restaurants subsector. The lowest growth of 0.6 per centamong the sub sectors in the Services sector was recorded in2003 by Public administration and defence, reflecting theimpact of the ongoing fiscal consolidation strategy.Health and education services are still largely provided bythe government even though the private sector share has beenrising continuously. In the health services, the private sectorshare has already exceeded more than half with expandingprivate health service facilities. Private sector investment,including foreign investment, continued to expand healthfacilities and improve the quality of service, Meanwhile,public sector health services suffered significantly in 2003from a series of labour disputes resulting in severeinconvenience to the public, particularly to the patients in lowincome groups who cannot afford to obtain private healthservices. Even though private sector education services havebeen expanding continuously in the recent past, archaicrestrictions on the opening of university education to theprivate sector constrained the potential faster expansion ineducation services in the country.

1.4 Consumption, Savings and InvestmentIn 2003, on the aggregate demand (AD) sider , all threedemand components, i.e., domestic consumption, investmentand exports of good and non-factor services, contributed tothe annual growth of 7.5 per cent in real terms (i.e., at

Meanwhile,reflecting improved business confidence, reduced interestrates and increased government capital expenditure,investment contributed about 35 per cent compared with l6per cent in 2002, raising the total contribution of domesticdemand (i.e., consumption and investment) to the increase inAD to 84 per cent. The contribution of the external demand(i.e., export of goods and non-factor income) was l6 per cent,reflecting the slow recovery in exports. Reflecting highgrowth in consumption and investment, domestic demandgrew by 8.4 per cent in real terms, while the aggregatedemand, including exports, recorded a growth of 7,5 per centin 2003.

Domestic consumption, in real terms, grew by 6.1 percent in 2003 following a 6.5 per cent growth in 2002. Thisgrowth was mainly supported by the improved consumerconfidence and pent up demand in the North with thecontinuation of the ceasefire, increased per capita income,reduced interest rates and the boom in tourism. The increase

was entirely due to an increase in private sector consumption,

as government consumption, in real terms, declined under thefiscal consolidation strategy. Within private consumer

demand, higher increases were recorded in consumer durables,particularly electronic goods. Meanwhile, the annual growthin investment, in real terms, rose to l7 per cent in 2003compared with 6.7 per cent in 2002, reflecting improvedbusiness confidence. lower lending rates. and increasedgovernment investment including reconstruction activities inthe North and the East, albeit at a lower level than expected.Investment expansion was mainly recorded in the areas ofpower, roads, telecommunications and building construction,The recovery in the world economy, improved trade relationswith major trading partner countries and improved externalcompetitiveness of the country, as reflected by depreciation inthe REER, supported the expansion of the exports of goods

and non-factor services, which grew by 4.8 per cent.

I Private Inveslment# Government Inveslment

1 9992001

The private sector accounted for the larger share in bothconsumption (91 per cent) and investment (76 per cent). The

corresponding share of government recorded declines in thelast two years, as government expenditure remained tight

under the ongoing fiscal consolidation strategy,Investment and savings grew, albeit at a lower rate than

expected. A higher growth in national savings than in capitalaccumulation (i.e., investment) reduced the domestic resourcegap. The ratio of investment to GDP increased to 22.3 per

cent in 2003 from 21.3 per cent in 2002, reflecting a recoveryin both private investment and public investment, though theywere below expectations. However, as this level ofinvestment is not adequate to support the achievement ofeconomic growth in excess of 8 per cent envisaged in the

PRSP, urgent ef'forts are necessary to raise private investment,

as well as public investment, In this context, it is prudent togenerate more room in the budget by raising revenue andcontaining recurrent expenditure to raise governmentinvestment to over 6 per cent of GDP, while directing public

investment more towards infrastructure development financedmainly with concessional foreign assistance, as this will

encourage private investment by playing a catalytic role rather

than substituting for it,It is encouraging that both the domestic savings to GDP

and national savings to GDP ratios increased about marginallyin 2003 making available more domestic resources forinvestment, The domestic savings to GDP ratio rose by L2percentage points to 15.7 per cent, mainly reflecting areduction in government dis-savings (i.e., current accountdeficit in the budget), by 1.1 percentage points of GDP.Meanwhile, national savings to GDP rose by a higher value(1,8 percentage points) reflecting increased private foreign

transfers, mainly private remittances. Benefitting from growth

in private remittances, the private national savings to GDP

ratio rose to25.7 per cent, compared with the domestic private

savings to GDP ratio at 19.0 per cent. Thus, private foreign

transfers have become a major contributor to national savings,accounting for about 31 per cent. However, Sri Lanka's

savings to GDP ratio has remained significantly lower than the

comparable ratios in a number of Asian countriesr. This was

due to both continuation of dis-savings by the public sector

and relatively low savings habits in the private sector. Themedium-term fiscal adjustment strategy already envisagesturning around the government from a negative saver to apositive saver. Measures are also necessary to raise private

savings as improvements in public savings alone would not besufficient to raise the national savings to GDP ratio to an

adequate level to cover the high investment (over 30 per centof GDP) required to achieve the desirable growth rate over 8per cent, envisaged under the poverty reduction strategy

agreed with the main donors.

1.5 Income Distribution and Poverty

The average family income in Sri Lanka is significantlydifferent among the three major sectors, i.e., urban, rural, and

estate, while the income distribution is skewed more towardsthe high income categories as indicated in the HouseholdIncome and Expenditure Surveys undertaken by the

Department of Census and Statistics2. Nevertheless, poverty

months each over an entire calendar year, with the samplebeing distributed e venly across calendar quarters, dish'ictsand sectors (rural, ulban and estate) to ensurereplesentativeness of the sampie. The sample consists ofaround 12,000 households. This is a larger sample than the8,663 households selected for the previous survey

conducted in 1996191. The sample size was increased to

accommodate inclusion of the tbur new districts of theNorth and Eitst, rvhile ensuring reliability of estimates at

reported here are based on preliminary inftlrmaLion fi'omRound 1 of-the survey that was conducted from earlyOctober to late f)ecember 2003 and covered 2,897househcllds, The distribution of households among therurnl, ulban and estate sectors was 82 per cent, l3 per cent

and 5 per cen[, respectively, consistent with the populationdistribution across these sectors in the Census 2001.

3. Preliminary Findings

Household Size : Preliminary findings indicated thathousehold size has continued to decline, This was seen in

all three sectors, with the lowest decline in the estate sector(Table 1). On average, household size had reducedsignificantly f'rom around 5 persons 20 yeals ago to around4 persons now, There were 1.6 income receivers per

household on average and this had not changed in 20 years.

However; h'ends were mixed across sectors. The number'of income receivers in a household in the estate sector had

continuously declined ovef this period, while in the urbanand rural sectors, there had been marginal increases

between l98ll82 and 1996/97, although this trend had notcontinued thereafter. This may have been due to the l'act

that dur ing this 20 year period, household members in theestate sector may have sought higher educational

attainment, following improved opportunities, or moved

TABLE 1Househol d Characteristics

The Statistics Department of the Central Bank commencedfield work on the Consumer Finances and Socio EconomicSurvey 2003/01 (CFS 2003/04) in early October 2003.This is the eighth srrvey in the series that began in 1953.The main objective:of the survey series is to collectcomplehensive data on demoglaphic characteristics,housing conditions, income, expenditure, consumption,indebtedness, savings and investment patterns ofhouseholds in the country. l'hese surveys have been a keysource of infbrmation on socio-economic conditions andconsurnption patterns in the country for planner-s, decisionmakels; researchers, the business community, inter-nationalorganisations and the general public The current CFS2003104 is being conducted ;rfter a lapse of seven years

and covers four districts of the North and East, Batticaloa,Jaffna, Trincomalee and Vavuniya, afier a gap of 20 years.During this period, the seculity situation, as well as the lackof a population fi'ame I'rorn which to select a sample, didnot enable the conduct of the survey in those areas.However, with the conduct of the Census ol'Population andHousing 2001 (Census 2001) by the Department of Censusand Statistics (DCS), a population frame became availablelbr sample selection. Fu(her. with the ceasefire that cameinto operation in early 2002, field wolk in those fourdistricts was made possible. As the Census 2001 could not

be completed in three districts of'Killinochchi, Mannar andMullativu, there was no population liame lr'om which to

select a sample in those three districts and hence, they hadto be excluded from the current survey, which covers theother 22 distlicts. However, according to the DCS, thisomission excludes only around 6 per cent of the entirepopulation of the country. This survey, therefore, wouldprovide criticalli; important infbrmation on socioeconomicconditions in all parts of the c0untry, including the NoLthand East, that would help in the rehabilitation,reconslruction and development of Sri Lanka as a whole.

occupations such as paddy tarming that yielded low

Millennium Development Goals

In September 2000, at the United Nations Millennium

Summit, world ieadeLs agreed to a set of time bound and

measurable goals and talgets for combating poverty,

hunger, disease, illiteracy, envit'onmental degradation anddiscrimination against women. These were named theMillennium Development Goatrs (MDGs).

There are eighteen targets grouped under eight goals.

These leadels have recognised that the goals for eradicatingpover'ty could be achieved only through stlongerpaltnerships among developing countries and through

increased action by rich countries, expanding trade, debtreliel', transferrjng technology and providing aid for

development.

Developing countlies have pursued policies to achieve

the underlying objectives of the MDGs for decades withonly limited success. Renewed etfort and strong politicalcommitment are needed for faster progress towards these

ends. As govemments assess how the goais rvillbe achievedby 2015, they assess policy priorities and develop national

strategres.Each goal is a specific commitment to reverse the

spread of poverty and disease, in most cases by 2015. The

eradication of poverty and hunger is the overarching goal.

The first seven goals indicate what poor countries must do

to achieve human development targets by way of adopting

pro-poor policies. The eighth goal is aimed at rich countries

and their commitment to respond to dsveloping countrieswith more aid, tairer terms of trade, and meaningful debt

relief.Sri Lanka. a member state of the United Nations,committed itself to achieve MDGs. Given the variouslvelfare programmes, free health and education facilitiesthat have been provided since the mid 1930s, Sri Lanka

ranks quite high in meeting most human developmenttargets, in comparison to other developing nations.

However, levels of poverty vary rvidely in the country, ancl

there are many areas where conditions are at unacceptable

levels. The main challenges tbr Sri Lanka in meetin,e the

MDGs will be lack of data in respect of some of the poorest

areas, particularly in the Nolth and the East, the scarcity of

financial and human resources, and inefficiencies rvitnessedin project i mplcmentation,After the adoption of the United Nations MillenniumDeclaration, international agencies worked togethel toidentify targets and quantitiable indicators that enable the

assessment of progress in meeting the MDGs. The tablebelow summadses Sri Lanka's situation in lespect of theeighteen targets under the eight golls. The Ministry ofPoiicy Planning and Lnplementation monitors the progressof MDGs in Sri Lanka with the assistance of UNDP,

has declined during the last twenty years though it is stillhigh, according to the information in the same surveys. Thepreliminary findings of the Consumer Finance and SocioEconomic Survey 200312004, undertaken by the CentralBank of Sri Lanka also confirm the overall improvement inreal income and widening income inequality in the country(Box l).[n2002, the average household income per month in theurban area, at Rs.23,436, was almost twice the average incomein the rural area (Rs.l1,819) and three times the averageincome in the estate sector (Rs.7,346). Similarly, significant

differences are seen in the average income per income receiver

among the three sectors. The skewness in income distributiontowards high income groups was clearly seen in thecomparison of relative income shares of different income

income decile (Rs.2,237). The average income per incomereceiver indicates an even higher difference. The averagemonthly income per income receiver in the highest incomedecile, at Rs.29,875, is almost seventy five times the

corresponding value for the lowest income decile (Rs.395).The estimated Gini coefficient, which measures theinequality in income distribution, increased from 0.43 in1980/81 to 0.46 in 1995/96 and further to 0.48 in 2002,demonstrating an increase in the inequality in incomedistributionr, indicating a Iow trickledown effect of thebenefits of economic growth.The average nominal household income per month rosefrom Rs.88l in 1980/81 to Rs.13,038 in2002, about a l5 fbld

increase. However, in real terms (at constant 1980/81 prices)it rose only by 63 per cent during the same 2l-year period,reflecting that a large part of the increase in nominal terms wasdue to the high inflation observed during the period. In USdollar terms, it rose fiom 49 dollars to 140 dollars during the

same period, recording only a 5.1 per cent annual growth.Apart from the average household leal income, otherselected indicators such as housing conditions and access toamenities indicate a continuous improvement in average livingconditions since 1980 though the achievements are belowexpectations (Table 1.6). Housing conditions have beenimproving significantly, while access to electricity and use ofelectronic items have been expanding continuously,Poverty has been a major economic problem in SriLanka, despite various poverty alleviation programmesimplemented since Independence in 1948. About 7 per cent ofSri Lanka's population are poor according to the lower povertyline (one US dollar per day), and about 45 per cent accordingto the higher poverty line (US dollars 2 per day). Based on theHousehold Income and Expenditure Survey data of theDepartment of Census and Statistics, poverty'(i.e., percentageof poor households below the estimated poverty line) hasdeclined from 30.4 per cent in 1990/91to26.7 per cent in

1995196 and further to 23.9 per cent in 2002. This decliningtrend indicates that the average income rose in low incomegroups, lifting some of the poor over the poverty line, thoughthe income inequality increased according to the Cinicoefficient,Poverty in the rural areas (31.3 per cent of people) ismore than three times that in the urban areas (8.6 per cent).Over 90 per cent of the poor live in rural areas. Therefore,

A Gini coefficient equal to zeroindicates a perfect equal income distribution and a coefficientequal to one implies perfect inequality.2 Defining poverty in terms of adequacy in energy intake, thosehouseholds spending morethan 50 percentof their expenditureon food and average adult equivalent food expenditure is lessthan Rs.1,338.48 per adult per month are considered as poorhouseholds in the HIES Report-2002.

deciles. For example, the share of the highest income decile intotal income, at 38.6 per cent, is about twenty three times ashigh as the share of the lowest income decile (1.7 per cent)indicating a highly unequal income distribution. Similarly, the

highest two income deciles together account for more than halfof the total income (53.7 per cent), while the lowest five

deciles (i.e., the lower half of the total income deciles) accountonly for about one fifih (19.6 per cent) of the total income, Inother words, the relative share of the lowest five deciles intotal income is only about half of the income share of the topdecile.

poverty in Sri Lanka is overwhelmingly a rural issue,especially where access to physical and social infrastructure isleast developed. Analyses indicate that, apart from the twodecade long conflict, inadequate growth, particularly a lowgrowth in agriculture, lack of opportunities and access toresoulces and markets, and isolation of the poor, are the maincauses of poverty. It is encouraging that the poverty reductionstrategy (PRS) outlined in PRSP envisages reducing povertyby accelerating economic growth, improving productivity andremoving bariers, rather than depending on redistr-ibution asattempted in the past. The intended measures includeincreasing access to basic services (health and qualityeducation), connecting to input and output markets throughtransport, communication and information services, reformingland and labour markets, reducing high protectionism towardsimproving competitiveness, improving infrastructure, andstrengthening governance, as well as law and order.

1.6 Prices

Inflation and inflationary expectations declined at a faster ratethan expected throughout 2003, benefitting from factor-s on thedemand as well as the supply side. On the aggregate demandside, continuation of cautious monetary policy by the Centr-alBank, supported by fiscal consolidation, was successful inchecking the excess growth in the nominal aggregate demandand hence, contained upward pressures on the general pricelevel. On the supply side, increased domestic agriculturalproduction, improvement in transportation and distribution ofgoods, benefitting from the ceasetire, stability in the exchangerate and easing of import prices for some food items, reducedthe pressure on domestic prices.All consumer price indices registered a continuousdownward trend in 2003, despite increases in administeredprices of tlansport fares and petroleum prices, reflectingchanges in international petroleum prices. The averageannualised inflation rate, which decelerated from l0 - 14 percent at end 2001, depending on the price index, to 7 - 10 percent at end2002, further declined Io 2 - 6 per cent at end 2003.The Sri Lanka Consumers' Price Index (SLCPI), the newindex with recent weights and broader geographical andincome group coverage, registered an annual increase of 2.6per cent in 2003, compared with 10.2 per cent in 2002 andI2.I per cent in 2001. In the commodity wise classification allsub-indices recorded similar decelerations, reflecting awidespread moderation in price increases, The food, beverageand tobacco category, having the largest relative weight of71.2 per cent, Lecorded price increases of only I per.cent in2003, benefitting mainly from the record paddy harvest,recovery in the coconut cr-op and production increases in otherdomestic food crops. This sharp deceleration in food priceincreases moderated the impact of relatively high priceincreases of 6 - 8 per cent recorded in the sub-indices coveringpetroleum products, transport, and miscellaneous goods andservices. The Colombo Consumers' Price Index (CCpI), the

official price index for consumer price inf'lation, covering aconsumption basket of low-income households in theColombo Municipal area, registered similar reductions, withits annual average increase declining from 9.6 per cent in2002to 6.3 per cent in 2003. Sectorwise analysis of commodities inits basket indicates that the inflation reflected by prices ofdomestically produced goods and services decelerated faster,decreasing tiom 8,4 per cent in 2002 to 4.7 per cent in 2003,compared with a deceleration in import price increases from14,5 per cent to I2.2 per cent, during the same period.Consequently, the relative contributory share of domesticprices in the overall inflation declined from 76 per cent in2002 to 60 per cent in 2003, while the conh'ibution of importprices rose from 24 to 40 per cent, during the same period.Meanwhile, the underlying inflationary expectations asimplied by interest rates at government bond auctions andforward premia in the foreign exchange market declined,indicating a downward adjustment in market inflationaryexpectations. [n addition to thc continuing downward trend inlealised inflation, a number of other factors influenced thisreduction. The proven commitment of the government to strongfiscal consolidation preventing infl ationary deficit financing

and an improvement in market confidence in a monetary policy

stance aimed at containing inflation helped in reducing highinf-lationary expectations, which have remained high over along period in the country. This downward adjustment was alsosupported by the continuation of the independently floatingexchange rate system and automatic regular adjustments inadministered prices such as domestic petroleum prices andtransport f-ares, accelerating the pass-through of the impact ofinternational price changes and hence preventing accumulationof inflationary pressures in the economy.Despite the recent declining trend, inflation andinflationary expectations in Sri Lanka are still high, comparedwith inflation rates of I - 3 per cent in the country's tradingpartner and competitor countries. Reducing the country'sinflation and maintaining it at a comparably low level willreduce the pressure on the exchange rate and contain excessivewage demands, thereby breaking down the vicious circlebetween inflation and wage increases, as well as betweeninflation and exchange rate depreciation. In this context,continuation of prudent monetary policy, supported by anappropriate fiscal policy stance, implementation ofproductivity improving structural refbrms and productivity

based wage settlements as a national policy, and improvementin exchange rate stability are crucial in ensuring theachievement of sustainable low inflation.Similarly, the availability of a representative and widelyaccepted consumer price index having recent weights andcovering a large income segment of the society andgeographical area in the country is critical in containing actualinflation as well as intlationary expectations. The currentofficial consumer price index, the CCPI, has a number of wellknown weaknesses due to its old base year of 1952 and limited

1. Introduction

Information on price movemen{s is vital tor economic

decision-making. as price changes impact on economic

activities in various rvays and to dift-erent degrees, Such

information is critical fbr policy makers to maintain pricestability, and thereby consumer and investor contidence,that ultimately generate econontic expansion anddevelopment. Price movements also influence wage

revisions and vice vetsa, Movements in prices are captured

statistically through price indices. Among them, Consumer

Price Indices (CPIs) which msasure changes in the cost ofliving are the most important for wage indexation and

payment of cost of living allowances (COLA) to lvorkers.A CPI is a weighted average of the prices of consumer

items in a selected consumption basket. It records the

aggregate movements of prices and enables comparisonwith the aggregate plice level duling a benchmark or baseperiod, Since market conditions and consumption habits

change, the consumption basket as r.l'ell as the base periodhave to be revised over time, so that the CPI lsreprescntative of such changes and remains relevant.Usually, information from household income and

expenditure surveys are used to make such revisions,

2. A General Comparison of the CCPI andSLCPI

At present, many diff'erent CPIs with different base years

and consumption baskets covering different geographical

regiclns and income/expenditure groups melsure consumer

pdce movements in Sri Lanka, Cunently, the oldest index,the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI), which is

confined to the consumption basket of the lowest 40 per

cent of households, rankedby their monthly income, within

the Colombo Municipality, with a 1952 base year, is used

as the otficial measure of consumeL price movements in thecountry, The Depaltment of Ce nsus and Statistics (DCS)

computes the CCPI monthly. This index is now older thanhalf a century and lacks all the vital characteristics requiredin a tepresentative CPi.In order to address these shortcomings, the DCS

developed a new CPI, the Sri Lanka Consumer Price Index(SLCPI), to replace the CCPI, The SLCPI is based on the

consumption baske t ret-lected in the Household Income and

Expenditure Survey (HIES) conductedby the DCS in 1995/96. It has a much more recent (1995-1997) base period forprices than the CCPI and a far wider geographical and

income/expenditure group coverage, as its consumption

The sub-indices also enable monitoring of pdce movements

Part IChapter 1 - ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, OUTLOOK, ISSUES AND POLICIES

Currently, the COLA for priblic sector employees is

computed on the basis of changes in the CCPI, at the rate ofRs.2 per index point, as per Administration CircularNo.l l IIE. 29 DA of l8 November 1981. As the CCPI

basket was valued at Rs. 202inthe base year, the unit COLA

per percentage point increase in the CCPI was tecommended

as Rs. 2 at that time. The total value of the SLCPI basket for

its base period was Rs, 4,785.96, whjch indicates that the unitCOLA per percentage point incrcase of the SLCPI would be

around Rs. 48. It is seen that a one percentage point increaseof the SLCPI should be approximately equal to a24

percentage point increase of the CCPI (4812). Assuming that

both CPIs are comparable measures of changes in the cost ofliving. payment oIthe COLA under wage indexation to either'CPI should provide for similar payments, although not

identical, over time. However, it could be expected that thernore replesentative CPI lvould provide tor a more realistic

measure of such changes.Certain trade unions have expressed concerns thatconverting fiom one CPI to another would be detrimenta.to their COLA. These concerns are unjustified. Table 2

changes in index points and the corresponding paymentsthat rvould have been made since the base period, atdifferent points in time: during the last 6 years wererelatively close, varying by around 0 per cent - 20 per

cle ar that there is no bias in either direction for COLApayments, whichever CPI is used. Thus, a careful

comparison of the CCPI and SLCPI indicates that there isno advantage to the u,orkers in the calculation of theCOLA in favour of the CCPL In fact, use of the SLCPI

as the official consumer price index and discontinuation ofother less representative consumer price indices rvouldfacilitate eftorts to leduce inflation in the country (Box 3).

1.7 Wages

Actual rva-ee increases were moderate in 2003 despite strong

pressures tbr high wage increases. Public sector wage indicesremained unchanged at the 2002 levels, as there wefe nogeneral wage increases in 2003, after two wage increasesgiven in 2001 and 2002. The average wage in the organisedprivate sector, as measured by the minimum wages under the

Wages Boards, rose by 7 per cent in 2003, compared with 7.4

per cent in2002. Among the sub-sectors, agriculture lecoldedthe highest increase ol 9 pe-r cent, mainly reflecting strong

union pressure, follor.l,ed by tt2 per cent increase in industly

and no increase in the services sector. Wages in the infolmal

sector, r,l'hich are determined by demand and supply forces inthe rlarket, had increases ranging from 3 per cent to l9 percent. The highest wage rncrease of about l9 per cent wasrecorded in the rubber tapping cate-tory for the second

consecutii'e year, reflecting the incleased demand tor Iabourand the ability to pay higher wa_qes benefittin-u from thecontinuation of high rubber price s. Relatively higher wage

increases, ranging from 4 to l3 per cent, were also lecordedin the paddy sector, mainly reflecting high demand fol labourrvith the increased extent cultivated and recot'd paddy han,est.

Retlecting the impact of increased construction actil'ities, daily

\ /ages in the construction sector rose within a range of 7 to 9per cent. Given the annual inl'latron of 2.6 to 6.3 per cent,

dependin-q on the price index, changes in real wages weremixed in 2003, but all rvorkers benefited from disint'lation.

Wages in the public sector were raised by l0 per centwith effect from January 2004 in Bud-eet 2004, Hou,ever, it isimportant to note that this wage increase wrs given as a partof a medium-term civil service retbrm programme proposed in

Budget 2004. The three-yeal refbrm programme rvill provide

2004 - 2006, conditional on a 30 per cent reduction in publicsector employment, It is expected to cut employment by l0 percent through a targeted voluntary retirement scheme in 2004.Wages in the subsequent two years will be raised if theprevious year's employment reduction target is met. Thisproposed system will provide an opportunity to raise publicsector wages by a reasonable rate over a 3 year period, whilekeeping the wage bill constant as a ratio of GDP. It will alsoenable the size of civil service, which is consideredsignificantly over staffed, to be reduced. However, the benefitsof this reform programme will depend mainly on the propertargetting to those sections of the cadre where redundancy islargest and containing the compensation package at anaffordable level.As explained in the National Employment Policy issuedin2002 by the Government and emphasised in the previousissues of the Central Bank Annual Report, linking wageincreases to productivity improvement will help to prevent thevicious circle between price increases and wage increases andencourage labour intensive investment creating moreemployment opportunities. In this context, acceleratingstructural reforms that improve productivity, particularlylabour market reforms, has a significant role to play.

1.8 Population, Labour Force andEmployment

Population growth fell marginally to 1.3 per cent in 2003,following a temporary increase to 1.5 per cent in2002 causedby the return of a large number of Sri Lankans with theprogress on the peace process. The annual average populationgrowth in Sri Lanka has been well below that of mostcountries in the South Asian region, reflecting the effect ofhigh literacy rates, successful family planning andimprovements in other socio-economic conditions.Nevertheless, a net addition of about 250,000 persons annuallyto the existing population raises the burden on the limitedresources in the country and indicates the desirability offurther reduction in population growth. The mid-year

Continuation of htgh u nentployment

population in 2003 is estimated to be 19.3 million. District-wise estimates indicate that people have been moving fromMullaitivu, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya and Mannar to Jaffna,Trincomalee and Batticaloa, reflecting the return of internallydisplaced people to their original homes, with improving iivilconditions under the continuing ceasefire.According to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey(QLFS)r conducted by the Department of Census andStatistics (DCS), the labour force at the end of the third quarterof 2003 (Q3/2003) was estimated at 7.6 million, an increase of559,000 (7.9 per cent) over the third quarter in 2002 (Q3/2002). The labour force participation rate declined to 48.6from 49.4 per cent during the same period. This decline wasentirely due to the inclusion of the Eastern Province in 2003,which had a lower participation rate. The male participationratio continued to rcmain at around 67 per cent. This was more

than double the female participation rate, which was around 3lper cent.The estimated total number of employees rose2 to 6.58million in Q3/2003 (excluding Eastern Province) from 6.41million in Q3/2002, an increase of 175,000 jobs during aperiod of twelve months. The share of employment in theagricultural sector rose to 35 per cent, while the shares of theservices and industrial sectors declined to 43.3 per cent and21.7 per cent, respectively. This could be due to the largerrelative shares in agricultural employment in the new province

added to this survey, i.e., the Eastem Province, in 2003. It isnoteworthy that the relative share of public sector employeescontinued to decline, from 23 per cent in l99l to l3 per centin 2003, while the shares of private sector employees and theself-employed increased to about 44 and 29 per cent,respectively, reflecting the impact of the private sector ledeconomic development strategy.The share of employed persons in the labour force roseto 91.6 per cent in Q3/2003 from 90.9 in Q312002. indicatingthat the number of new jobs created in the economy wasgreater than the number of net additions to the labour force.Consequently, the unemployment rate declined to 8.4 per centfrom 9.1 per cent during the same period. Unemploymentcontinued to be high among youth with higher education,albeit with some marginal declines recorded in 2003,reflecting the continuation of the mismatch in the labourmarket. This clearly indicates the necessity of urgent reformsin education and training.Employment in the public sector continued to decline forthe second consecutive year, decreasing by about 18,200 or 1.7per cent to 1.043 million at end 2003. This reduction wasreflected in both government and semi-government sectors,The reduction was higher in the semi-government category (5

per cent), This was the outcome of the continuation of the

freeze on recruitment to the public sector unless there was aclear and strong justification for recruitment. A higher

reduction was recorded in the semi-government sector due to

the continuation of the privatisation programme, retirementwithout extension after 55-57 years of age and successfulvoluntary retirement schemes (VRS). VRS schemes wereimplemented successfully at the Sri Lanka Ports Authority,Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and Sri Lanka Telecom Ltd.,

reducing employees by about 7,000 in 2003. Nevertheless, the

total employment in the public sector remained high at 1.043million or l5 per cent of total estimated employment in the

country, even after a quarter of a century since the introductionof a market oriented economic policy framework.Migration for foreign employment continued to increasein 2003. The registered number of annual departures forforeign employment increased by 2.3 per cent, reaching208,439. This was an increase compared with 203,773departures in 2002, but was below the annual forecast of

210,000 for 2003. Increasing competition from other labour

supplying developing countries and concerns about the safetyof migrant female workers were the major contributory factorsfor this deceleration. The share of female workers declined

marginally to 64 per cent in 2003 fi'om 65 per cent in 2002, but

is still high. Similarly, the share of housemaids declined to 48

per cent, although they still have the highest share. Meanwhile,

the share of skilled migrants rose slowly but gradually,Major steps were initiated in 2003 to address long over

due labour market reforms. Accordingly, amendments to theTermination of Employment of Workmen Act (TEWA),

Industrial Dispute Act (IDA), Industrial Disputes - Hearingand Determination Proceedings Act (lDA-Hearing) and

Employment of Women, Young Persons, and Children Act(EWYPCA) were passed in 2003, enhancing flexibility andpredictability in the labour market. IDA and IDA-HearingActs were amended, fixing the time limits to complete

hearings of labour disputes in order to end the long delays indispute settlement. EWYPCA was amended to strengthenpenalties for violation of requit'ements under the Act. TheTEWA was amended to enable the introduction of a

mandatory formula for payment of compensation to retrenched

employees. The formula was announced at end 2003 after a

series of consultations with trade unions. These amendmentswere long overdue requirements. However, the benefits of

these amendments to the economy would depend heavily ontheir effective implementation.

Management (Responsibility) Act (FMRA). It also aimed at

supporting economic growth, implementing structural reforms

and creating productive employment in the economy. In thiscontext, Budget 2003 proposed a series of measures to

enhance government revenue, contain recurrent expenditure,

raise public investment, foster private investment and increaseproductivity in the economy.Accordingly, in the original budgetary estimates tbr 2003,

the fiscal deficit was expected to be reduced by 1.4 percentage

points to 7.5 per cent of GDP, through raising revenue by 0.6

per cent of GDP and reducing expenditure by 0.8 per cent of

GDP, Similarly, it was expected to reduce the current accountdeficit, which measures the level of government dis-savings,

and the primary deficit, which ret'lects the impact of the cunent

year's fiscal operation on the macro economy. The entire effbrt

to raise revenue was placed on increasing tax revenue, given

the limitations on mobilisation of additional non-tax revenue.

To contain expenditure, the full adjustment was placed on areduction of recurrent expenditure, since capital expenditure

was raised by 0.7 per cent of GDP to 5.3 per cent of GDP inorder to accelerate infrastructure development. In financing thedeficit, reliance on foreign financing and privatisation proceedswas raised significantly in order to contain net domesticborrowing at 4.9 per cent of GDP in 2003, compared with 8.8and 8.0 per cent of GDP in 2001 and2002, respectively. It isimportant to note that the domestic net borrowing level was

expected to decrease from Rs.126.4 billion in2002 to Rs.87.3billion, resulting in a 3l per cent decline. This was intended toreduce the pressure on domestic interest rates and release moredomestic financial resources to the private sector, and therebyto accelerate economic recovery.As a means of raising additional tax revenue in 2003, thebudget proposals placed major emphasis on expanding the tax

base under the Value Added Tax (VAT) and import tariff, andstrengthening tax administration. VAT has become the maintax source and was estimated to generate 45 per cent of total

tax revenue. Therefore, a number of measures were proposed

to expand the VAT base and improve VAT collection, Among

them were extending VAT to financial services and the retail

and wholesale business, correcting the weaknesses in the VATstructure, including the refund mechanism, and improving taxadministration. On the import tariff front, a new tariff rate of2 per cent was imposed on most exempted imports, as

increasing the number of items under the tariff exemption listwas the main cause for a significant reduction in the averageimport duty rate (i.e., total duty in relation to the value ofimports), which hampered the overall tax collectionr,Similarly, the coverage of the debit tax was extended to

savings deposits, expanding the tax base. Excise duty rates on

liquor and cigarettes were raised, while the excise tax on liquor

was streamlined by consolidating total tax liabilities under the

Excise Ordinance. As tax evasion has become a major factorweakening revenue mobilisation, a new tax amnesty was

granted in order to expand the tax base by bringing tax evadersinto the tax net.Continuing the expenditure containment measuresintroduced in 2002, Budget 2003 placed major emphasis onsuspending recruitment to the public sector, avoiding general

wage and pension increases, reducing the provision for det-enceexpenditure, better targetting of welfare programmes, limitingresource allocation for unforeseen and unclassified expensesand controlling provision of funds for rupee funded non-priority capital expenditure. Meanwhile, policies introduced torationalise expenditure in the medium term included theimposition of limits on government guarantees under theFMRA. Additional policies were the establishment of anindependent debt management office, continuing thecontributory pension scheme for new public sector employees,designing an overall welfare programme under the WelfareBenefit Law and reforms in public enterprises in order toreduce, and if possible to eliminate, their dependence on thebudget. In financing the deficit, emphasis was placed on low-cost long-term borrowing, while reducing high cost debt withcommercial banks and retiring high cost debt with optionalmaturities. These measures are expected to help to improve theshort-term stabilisation process, while enabling the

achievement of a sustainable deficit reduction in the medium tolong-run,Measures were also taken to strengthen theimplementation of fiscal measures. Accordingly, a high levelcommittee, namely, the PRGF Monitoring Committee,comprising senior officials from the public sector, wasappointed to ensure the implementation of fiscal policies andmaintenance of fiscal targets in the Poverty Reduction andGrowth Facility (PRGF) programme in 2003. The first MidYear Fiscal Position Report required under the FMRAprovided an opportunity fbr a comprehensive evaluation of theprogress in budgetary operations and to take additional

measures if necessary. The Report, presented to Parliament on30 June 2003, indicated the possibility of deviating from thefiscal targets, mainly due to the slippages on the revenue front.Therefore, a. series of additional tax policy measures and taxadministrative improvements were put in place during thesecond half of 2003 to arrest the deviations and keep thedeficit on track. These include extension of VAT coverage toany persons providing financial services, increasing thecorporate income tax rate applicable to the foreign currencybanking units (FCBUs) of commercial banks from 15 to 30 per

cent, restriction of input tax claims to l0 per cent and increaseof excise duty on cigarettes and liquor. Finally, to limit theexpansion of the fiscal deficit, rupee funded non-prioritycapital expenditures were curtailed,The realised budget outturn indicates that the fiscalconsolidation process made further progress in 2003, moving

towards the medium-term fiscal stabilisation targets envisagedunder the FMRA though the pace was slower than expected.These favourable developments include reductions (as a per

cent of GDP) in recurrent expenditure, the budget deficit andnet domestic borrowing for deficit financing; increases incapital expenditure and utilisation of foreign financing andcontaining the rising trend in debt to GDP ratio. Meanwhile,the public sector deficit (as a percentage of GDP), includingdeficits in public corporations, declined by a larger value than

the reduction in the budget deficit, reflecting the benefits ofreforms in public enterprises. However, a large revenueshortfall not only limited the fiscal improvements expected inthe budget, but also compelled the government to cut capitalexpenditure, adversely affecting the expansion in potential

economic capacity,Despite a revenue shortfall of about 0.8 per cent of GDPin 2003, the overall fiscal deficit to GDP declined by about 0.9

percentage points due to a reduction in expenditure by 1.7 per

cent of GDP. However, the reduction in the overall deficit wasabout 0.5 per cent of GDP, less than expected in the budget.The large reduction in expenditure was entirely due to areduction in recurrent expenditure by 1.9 per cent of GDP as

the capital expenditure to GDP ratio increased by 0.2 per cent.Consequently, the current account deficit recorded a largerreduction by about l. I per cent of GDP, reflecting a favourablefiscal adjustment. Meanwhile, foreign financing increasedsharply, exceeding even the budget estimate and thus reducing

the net domestic deficit financing requirement by 3.5 per centof GDP (Rs.46.7 billion), reducing pressure on the domesticinterest rate and releasing more resources to the private sector.As the total available domestic non-bank resources, at Rs.l l0billion, were higher than the government's net domesticborrowing requirement of about Rs.79.7 billion. thegovernment took this opportunity to reduce its liabilities to thebanking sector. Consequently, net credit to the governmentfrom the banking system declined for the second consecutiveyear, recording a Rs,4,8 billion (0.3 per cent of GDP) declinein2002 and a Rs.20.9 billion (1.2 per cent of GDP) decline in

2003, reversing the rising trend observed before 2002. Despite

the reduction of budget deficit and domestic debt/GDP ratio in2003 depreciation of rupee against SDR and Yen towards the

end of 2003 resulted an increase in total outstanding debt/GDPratio to 105.9 per cent at end 2003.The benefits of these fiscal improvements are alreadyreflected in the economy, First, they facilitated pursuing growthsupportive monetary policy without increasing intlationarypressure and helped to reduce inflationary expectations.Second, they reduced the pressure on domestic interest rates,contributing to shifting the entire yield curve downward. Thedeclining domestic interest rates, in turn, reduced thegovernment's interest burden by about Rs.2,2 billion in 2003alone. The reduction in the interest burden is significantlylarger, when the benefits in the future years are considered, as

the government was able to issue long-term Treasury bonds atsignificantly lower rates and to replace some high-cost debt

28Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2003

Part Ichapter 1 - EcoNoMlc PERFORMANCE, ourlooK, tssuES AND poltctES

with low-cost new bonds. Thirdly, they facilitated economicrecovery by making available more domestic financialresources to the private sector at lower rates.However, still there is a long way to go in order to ensurethe medium-term fiscal sustainability expected in the FMRA,as revenue mobilisation and capital expenditure are very low,while the deficit and debt burden are significanrly higher rhanthe desired levels. The major challenge in moving forward isreversing the declining trend in the revenue to GDp ratio. Thishas declined continuously, from about l9 per cent in early the1990s to 13.2 per cent in 2003. The reduction is about 6 percent of GDP or Rs.l06 billion in relarion to GDp in 2003,which is even larger than the government's annual wage billor total capital expenditure. Reversing this trend will requirechanges in both tax policy and tax administration. In tax policyrefbrms, major emphasis has to be placed on expanding the taxbase, reducing or if possible eliminating tax exemptions,waivers and tax holidays, In tax administration reforms,attention needs to be given to strengthening management,improving human skills, reforming incentive structures,improving accountability, sh'engthening the legal structure andimproving coordination among major revenue mobilisinginstitutions. The proposed Revenue Authority will provide anideal opportunity to address these issues effectively.On the revenue side, a large shortfall was recordedentirely due to poor performance in tax revenue, as non-taxrevenue exceeded the budget target in 2003. The tax/GDp ratiocontinued its decline reaching 13.2per cent in 2003, the lowestrecorded level, in contrast to the expected improvement inBudget 2003. The shortfall was Rs.33.l billion or 12.5 per centof expected tax revenue. This shortfall was mainly due todelays in implementing some revenue proposals, poor taxcompliance and weak tax administration, Slippages in VAT(Rs.23.2 billion) and income rax (Rs.9.l billion) wer-e themajor causes as collections under excise duty and taxes oninternational trade marginally exceeded the annual budgetestimates. The lagged effect of investment allowances andAdvanced Company Tax (ACT) abolished in 2002, poor taxcompliance, weak tax administration and an effective incentivesystem were the major factors that resulted in the largeshortfall of l9 per cent in income tax. Consequently, theincome tax to GDP ratio declined from2.4 per cent in 2002 to2.2 per cent in 2003, despite continuation of economicrecovery and improved corporate sector profitability. Thecorporate income tax to GDP ratio declined below one percent, ref'lecting a 33 per cent reduction during the five-yearperiod 1991-2003r. The shortfall in VAT was mainlyattributed to the postponement of some measures to expand thetax base (such as expansion to wholesale and retail trade),

1 Sri Lanka has the lowest corporate income tax to GDp ratio(1.3 per cent in 2001) compared with other countries in tneAsian region: India (1.6 percent), the philippines (2.7 percent),Thailand (2.9 per cent), Vietnam (5.6 per cent), Mataysia (6,2per cent). The ratio for Sri Lanka declined f urther to 0.g per centof GDP in 2003.

leakages under the refund mechanism under dual VAT rates,and weaknesses in the VAT audit system and administration.Meanwhile, a higher profit transfer of Rs.l,7 billion anddividend from Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (Rs.750million) and collection of Rs.2 billion from the Srrike, Riot,Civil Commotion and Terrorism Fund helped the non-taxrevenue collection to exceed its target by Rs.5.7 billion orabout L2 per cent in 2003 compared with 2002.On the expenditure side, a saving in the currentexpenditure of about Rs.l0 billion and a cut in capitalexpenditure by Rs.l0.8 billion resulted in a lower rotalexpenditure by about Rs.20.7 billion or 4.7 per cent less thanthe budget estimate. The key measures that enabledexpenditure consolidation were the streamlining of det-enceexpenditure, benefits of continuation of the ceasefire, thefreeze on recruitment to the public sector, avoidance of ad hocwage increases, strict control on transfer payments to sub-national levels of government and public institutions andrationalisation of current payments on other goods andservices. The savings in current expenditure were ref-lectedmainly in interest payments (Rs.5.l billion) and currenttransfers and subsidies (Rs.5.7 billion), as expenditure ongoods and services remained almost on talget. The reductionin interest payment was mainly due to a decline in domesticmarket interest rates, replacing of high cost borrowing withlow cost new issues of debt instruments, and improvements inTreasury cash management and public debt management.Despite additional expenditure pressures and unexpectedexpenditure on flood relief, total expenditur.e in 2003 wasbelow the level rn 2002, as well as the budget estimate.Meanwhile, all major items that recorded expenditure overrunsin the past, such as transfers to public institutions andSamurdhi, were maintained well within the budgetaryallocations. These outcomes clearly indicate the government'sstrong commitment to fiscal consolidation, Reflecting thebeneflt of the continuing ceasefire, defence expenditure wascontained at Rs.47 billion, a 4.4 per cent reduction in nominalterms. As a ratio of GDP too, it declined, reaching 2.7 per centin 2003 compared with 4.5 per cenr in 2000. Continuation ofthis favourable declining tlend in recurrent expenditure toGDP is crucial for realising the medium-rerm fiscalstabilisation targets envisaged in the FMRA.The public investment programme recorded a marginalimprovement, increasing only to 5 per cent of GDP in 2003from 4.6 per cent of GDP in 2002. This was lower thanexpected in the budget (5,3 per cent of GDP), as well as themedium-term desirable level of over 6 per cent. The lowincrease was mainly due to restrictions on releasing funds tolow priority capital expenditure projects in the attempt to amestthe deviation in the fiscal deflcit.The ovelall budget deficit declined trom 8.9 per cent in2002 to 8.0 per cent in 2003, continuing the downward trendobserved in 2003. In nominal terms, the deficit was at the level(Rs.l4l billion) that prevailed in 2002. However, the cun'ent

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 200329

Part IChapter 1 - ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, OUTLOOK, ISSUES AND POLICIES

account deficit and primary deficit declined, not only in termsof GDP, but also in nominal terms, The primary account

deficit declined by Rs.8.6 billion to Rs.16 billion, continuing

its declining trend. The current account deficit declined by a

larger value of Rs.I I billion, reflecting the benefits of savingsin intelest payments. In GDP terms, the primary deficit

declined to below I per cent of GDP, while the cunent accountdeficit declined to 3.3 per cent of GDP, recording a larger

reduction than the decline in overall deficit. However, all these

realised deficit values were higher than the budget targets. The

largest deviation of I per cent of GDP was recorded in thecurrent account deficit.In financing the fiscal deficit, the burden on domesticfinancing declined due to increased foreign resource

mobilisation and realisation of privatisation proceeds. Foreign

financing rose sharply to Rs.5l billion, compared with Rs.9billion in 2002 exceeding even the budget estimate of Rs.34billion. Implovements in foreign aid utilisation to US dollar

895 million and borrowing of US dollar 100 million (aboutRs.9.5 billion) from foreign banks under a Japanesegovernment guarantee (through NEXI) were the two

contributory factors for the increase. Meanwhile, the receipt ofprivatisation proceeds for deficit financing increased to

Rs.10.2 billion in 2003, from Rs.5.7 billion in2002, but it was

below the budget estimate of Rs,l3.5 billion, Privatisation of

Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (Rs.6 billion) and sale of 100

gas stations and one third of the common user facility in the

petroleum sector to the second player (receipts for budgetRs.2.7 billion) were the main sources of privatisation

proceeds. Consequently, net domestic financing declined by

31 per cent to Rs.79.7 billion, compared with Rs.126.4 billionrn 2002, even lower than the budget estimate of Rs.87.3

billion. The entire domestic bonowing was mobilised from thenon-bank sector through the issue of market based

instruments, i.e., Treasury bills and bonds.The government's overdrafts with commercial banks,which declined from Rs,38 billion at end 2001 to Rs.3.6billion at end 2002, declined further to about Rs.2 billion at

end 2003. Similarly, government import bills payable tocommercial banks decreased by Rs.l2.6 billion in 2003.

Government also repaid maturing dollar denominated Sri

Lanka Development Bonds amounting to US dollars 158.5million. Thus, the fiscal operations in 2003 helped to improve

the Iiquidity in the banking system significantly, thereby

supporting the declining trend in domestic interest rates. This

was further supported by the repayment of some outstanding

banking sector liabilities by public corporations.

Three major favourable developments were observed in

the government debt stock in 2003; a containment of the risein the public debt to GDP ratio, reduction of high-cost debt

and an increase in the average debt maturity with the issue of

long maturing debt instruments upto 20 years. The rise in the

government debt to GDP ratio was contained in 2003, movingonly from 105.4 per cent in 2002 to 105.9 per cent in 2003.

The total outstanding government debt rose by 12 per cent to

Rs.1,863 billion at end 2003. The increase of Rs.l94 billion

was mainly the outcome of the net bonowing (Rs,123 billion)

and impact of the depreciation of the exchange rate on debt

denominated in foreign currencies (Rs.68 billion), reflecting

the sensitivity of the debt burden to exchange rate variations.

Although the Sri Lankan rupee remained virtually unchanged

against the US dollar in 2003, it depreciated against the

Japanese yen (12.7 per cent) and the Special Drawing Rights

(SDR) (10.1 per cent), which account for about 75 per cent (34

and 41 per cent, respectively) of total foreign debt, In the debt

composition, domestic debt at end 2003 accounted for 57.9 per

cent, while the share of foreign debt was 47.9 per cent, of

which 99 per cent was in the concessional category.

The public sector deficit, consisting of the fiscal deficit

and the deficit of non-financial public corporations, also

continued to decline in 2003. With the improvements in the

performance of public corporations, their deficit declined by

about 0.1 per cent of GDP, reducing the total public sectordeficit by about l.l per cent of GDP to 7.9 percent of GDPin 2003.The outstanding debt stock of the public sector,

consisting of government debt and debt of the non-financial

public corporations, amounted to Rs.1,905 billion, of which

Rs.40.6 billion (2.3 per cent of GDP) was held by the publiccorporations. The public sector debt to GDP marginally

increased from 108.1 per cent in2002 to 108.2 per cent in

2003. This marginal increase was the outcome of reductions

in public corporation debt (0,4 per cent of GDP) and increaseof central government debt (0.5 per cent of GDP).In 2003, improvements in budgetary operations of

provincial councils (PCs) also helped the fiscal consolidation

increased by 24 per cent to 0.7 per cent of GDP, benefittingfrom the economic recovery. Increases in turnover tax and

GDP as in 2002. These developments helped to contain theirtranst'er requirements from the central govemment, However,their dependence on central government transfers is still highas their income is sufficient to cover only l3 per cent of theirtotal expenditure. Similarly, concerns have been raised aboutthe potential duplication of work and high operarional costsunder the existing PC system.

The external sector, where a better performance was observedin2002, imploved further in 2003, strengrhening the resilienceof the economy, benefiting from the world economic recovery,continuation of the ceasefire, improvement in economicmanagement and acceleration of structural reforms. A recoveryin expolts, increased inflows from services and animprovement in the income account, reduced the deficit in thegoods, services and income account, neuh-alising the impact ofan increase in imports, Meanwhile, increased privateremittances helped to reduce the external current accountdeticit to a significantly lower level of US dollars l0l million(0.6 per cent of GDP) compared with US dollars 237 million(1.4 per cent of GDP) in 2002. Ner inflows through rhefinancial and capital accounts increased sharply by 58 per centto US dollars 702 million, offsetting the current account deticitand resulting in a substantial surplus (US dollar-s 502 million)in the ovelall balance of payments for the third consecutrveyear. Consequently, the foreign reserves of the country rosefurther to comfbrtable levels, while pressure on the exchangerate decreased significantly; in fact, the rupee appreciatedagainst the US dollar, which is the major trading currency,before the political uncertainty in the last quarter of 2003.Finally, the country's external vulnerability declined as theimport coverage and coverage of short-term external liabilitiesby external reserves rose, and the external debt service ratiodecreased. Nevertheless still heavy dependence on only twoexpolt products (tea and garments, accounting for 63 per centof exports) and a few export markets (USA and EU accountingfor 93 per cent of garment exports), high costs of power anddoing business, excessive rigidities in the labour market andpolitical uncertainty have to be addressed effectively toimprove the resilience of the country to external shocks on amore sustainable basis.Several factors contributed to the achievements in 2003.On the domestic front, the benefits of the ceasefire werelef'lected clearly in increased tourist arrivals, capital inflowsand foreign assistance, as well as in reduced defence impor-ts.Improved macroeconomic management and continuation ofstructural reforms not only increased exports but alsoencouraged foreign investment and concessional foreignfinancing inflows. These policy reforms and the peace processalso led to the approval of the long overdue poverty Reductionand Growth Facility and the Exrended Fund Faciliry (pRGF-EFF) by the IMF, and enhanced assistance from the World

The approval of the PRGF-EFF and pRSC wasalso considered an endorsement of the country's economicpolicies envisaged in the povelty reduction strategy paper(PRSP). This endorsement helped to enhance concessionalassistance trom other donors and encourage fbreign investols.This was clearly reflected at the Tokyo meeting in June 2003at which donors pledged total assistance of about US dollars4.5 billion for the period of 2003 - 2006, Sri Lanka's improvedeconomic relations with major trading partner countries,particularly with India, USA and EU, helped the expansion inexports.

80 per cent of the increase in total exports, while agricultural

exports, dominated by tea (71 per cent), contributed only 6 per

compared with 5 per cent in2002, mainly reflecting increasedinput demand from the manufacturing sector. The Intermediatecategory accounted for more than half (56 per cent) of theincrease in total imports. Despite a sharp increase in petroleumprices (21 per cent), the petroleum import bill declined byabout 6 per cent due to a reduction in import volume,reflecting the reduced demand for fuel for thermal powergeneration. The second largest import category (22 per cent),consumer goods, expanded by 12 per cent, mainly reflectinga sharp increase in the import of non-food and drink andcontributed29 per cent of the increase in the total imoortvalue, Reflecting the impact of improved consumerconfldence, all major categories of consumer durable importsincreased significantly. with increased domestic agricuLturalproduction, the import volume of food items decreased by2 per cent in 2003 from an increase of 2l per cent in 2002.Imports of investment goods, accounting tbr about 20 per centof the total import bill, rose by l3 per cent and accounted for26 per cent of the increase in total inrport value. Reflectingrecovery in investment, all sub categories in capital goodsimports increased in 2003; h-ansport equipment by 37 per cent,building materials by 2l per cent and machinery andequipment by 9 per cent.In 2003, international prrces moved in favour of SriLanka, improving the terms of trade by 7 .4 per cent,compared with a 4.6 per cent improvement in 2002. This wasa combined outcome of an increase in the export unit priceindex and a decline in the import unit price index. The exportprice index rose by 5.5 per cent, compa'ed with a decline of4.1 per cent in 2002, solely benefitting from price increasesin manufactu'ing exports. Even though textile and garmentexports recorded a moderate price increase (3.6 per cent),non-garment exports experienced a relatively high priceincrease of ll.9 per cent. The unit price index for overallimpor-ts declined about 1.8 per cent fbllowing an g.3 per centdecrease in 20a2. This was entirely due to a decline in theinvestment goods prices (-1,2.3 per cent), as import pr.ices forintermediate (4.6 per cent) and consumer goods (0.5 per cent)recorded increases. The impact of the sharp increase inpetroleum prices (18 per cent) in intermediate goods wasmoderated by a decline in the import prices of textiles(-0.3 per cent).The direction of external trade continued to change,increasing the relative share of developing countries, albeitslowly. The share of developing countries as Sri Lanka'sexport destinations increased trom22 per cent in 1995 to 25per cent in 2003, while their share in the country's importsincreased from 64 to 68 per cent during the same period. Thegovernment continued its efforts to improve trade relationswith major trading partners in order to accelerate exportdiversification. In this context, special emphasis has beenplaced on negotiations with India, USA and EU as the lattertwo are the largest buyers of Sri Lankq's exports, while Indiais the largest source of imports.

The services account recorded a significant improvementowing to increased earnings from tourism and transportation,and recorded an increase of 34 per cent in net inflows in 2003.Tourist earning rose by 30 per cent. at a higher rate thananivals, (27 per cent) reflecting an increase in average touristspending. Net transportation services, which includedpassenger fares, freight services and port related services,increased by l0 per cent owing mainly to increasedtransshipment cargo handling and the country's externar trade,in addjtion to booming tourist arrivals. Meanwhile, the deficitin the income account contracted notably, owing to increasedincome earnings from the country's international reserves.Despite continuation of Iow interest rates in intelnationalfinancial markets, increased external reserves andimprovements in official reserve management raised thereceipts in the income account, reversing the declining trendrecorded in the previous years. Income generated from theofficial external reserves more than doubled, rising fr-om USdollars 4l million in2002, to US dollars l l0 million in 2003,which was sufficient to cover 75 per cent of the interestpayments on government external debt.Current transfers continued to grow steadily, recording a9 per cent growth in 2003. This was mainly due to increasingremittances by migrant workers, who remitted US dollars1,414 million, an increase of l0 per cent in 2003. The higherannual increase than in previous years was due to an increasein the number of migrant workers and higher h'ansf-ers in thefirst qualter of 2003 caused by the uncertainties that prevailedin the Middle East region prior to the war in Iraq. The ongoingefforts for peace and the improved security situation in theNorth and the East also contributed to channelling more fundsthrough the formal financial sector. Despite a recen[ decline,West Asia accounted for the largest share (57 per cent) ofremittances, while the share of the second largest source,Europe, rose to l8 per cent. Other major contributors wereNorth America (6 per cent) and the Far East (5 per cent).Remittances have become the most steady and largest singlenet foreign exchange source to Sri Lanka, and were sufficientto cover 92 per cent of the h'ade deficit in 2003. Similarly,worker remittances have a greater distributional impact as theirbenefits are spread among a large number of low incomefamilies scattered all over the country.In the capital and financial accounts, inflows to thegovernment through loans and privatisation proceeds, andcontinuation of foreign direct investment helped to record alarge net int'low. Increased donor asslstance as a strong supportfor the peace process, improvement in economic management,implementation of structural refolms, and improvements in aidutilisation resulted in a significant increase in long-terminflows to the government. The gross long-term inf'lows to thegovernment increased by 68 per cent to US dollars 90gmillion, while the net value rose by more rhan three times,reaching US d.ollars 548 million, compared with US dollars162 million io2002. The utilisation ratio of foreign assistance,

which rose from 13 per cent in 2001 to 15 per cent in 2002,

rose further to 2l per cent in 2003, reflecting the benefits of

steps taken by the government to improve disbursementsr.This improvement was partly due to a larger amount of

programme financing being available for budgetary purposes.Disbursements of US dollars 556 million (17 per cent

increase) under prqect loans and US dollars 244 million under

programme financing (269 per cent increase) and the raising

of a commercial loan of US dollars 100 million under a NEXI

guarantee were the major contributory factors for a recordlevel of foreign aid disbursement in 2003. Meanwhile, the

repayment of government long-term loans declined to US

dollars 359 mi[ion from US dollars 380 million in2002 owing

to a decline in repayment of defence related loans from US

dollars 144 million to US dollars 92 million during the same

period.However, net private inflows declined from US dollars

185 million in 2002 to US dollars 140 million, largely due to

a decline in private sector foreign loans. The decline in theprivate sector foreign borrowings was mainly due to theinvestors' 'wait and see' approach, lower domestic interest

rates and increased liquidity. Privatisation proceeds from

foreign sources were lower than expected, mainly due to the

purchase of the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC) by a

local entity and delays in the receipt of the proceeds from the

Indian Oil Company (IOC). The lower net inflow in portfblio

investment was owing to a large outt'low of US dollars 40

million, resulting fiom the strategic purchase of the controlling

interest of a large hotel company by a local blue chip company

from foreign investors. Net foreign assets of commercial banks

improved by US dollars 96 million in 2003 in comparison to

the increase of US dollars 40 million in2002. This was mainly

due to the repayment of US dollars 158,5 million of dollar

denominated Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs), held by

commercial banks.The reduced current account deficit and increased surplusin the capital and financing accounts resulted in a record

surplus in the overall BOP, amounting to US dollars 502million in 2003, the second highest surplus ever recorded2.

Consequently, the country's gross official external reserves

lose by US dollars 629 million to US dollars 2,329 million(4.2 months import cover) in 2003, while the total gross

external reserves increased by US dollars 723 million to US

dollars 3,218 million (5.8 months import cover). The ratio of

gross official reserves to short-term Iiabilities (on the basis of

remaining period to maturity) increased from 76 per cent in2002 to 100 per cent in 2003, reducing the externalvulnelability of the country3.The independently floating exchange rate regime

continued to serve well, strengthening the exchange ratestability, deepening the foreign exchange market andimproving the country's external competitiveness' The

exchange rate of rupee against US dollar, which depreciated

slowly by 0,6 per cent, reaching Rs.97,28 in June, appreciated

thereafter reaching Rs.94.02 on 17 September. However, it

depreciated with relatively high volatility during the last

quarter due to uncertainty caused by political developments,

to Rs.96.74 at end 2003. This implied an annual depreciation

of only 0.01 per cent, compared with 3.7 per cent and I I'3 per

cent depreciations in2002 and 2001, respectively. However,

the rupee depreciated at a higher rate against the euro (16.6 per

cent), the pound sterling (9.9 per cent), Japanese yen (9'7 per

cent), the SDR (8,5 per cent) and the Indian rupee (5.1 per

cent), reflecting a sharp weakening of the US dollar against

othel international currencies. Reflecting these changes' the

nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) of the rupee based on

5-currency and 24-currency baskets depreciated by 5.0 percent and 5.9 per cent, respectivelya. These nominal

depreciations and the deceleration of the domestic inflation

improved Sri Lanka's external competitiveness measured in

terms of the real effective exchange rate (REER), namely, the

5-currency REER and the 24-currency REER, depreciating by

2,8 per cent and 3.4 per cent, respectively.

Fonward market volume increasing, while premia

The domestic foreign exchange market continued to

expand and deepen both in terms of volume of transactlons

and in terms of the duration of forward transactions, further

strengthening the stability in the exchange rate. The annual

volume of forward transactions rose by 48.4 per cent to USdollars 1.4 billion, which was 38 per cent of the total

transactions in the interbank market. Forward premia were

below interest rate diff'erentials throughout the year except fora few days during the last quarter. Exporters were more activethan importers in the forward market.The total external debt of the country as a ratio of GDpincreased slightly to 58.4 per cent in 2003 from 56.3 per centin 2002, reflecting higher foreign loan disbursement to thegovemment. The faster economic recovery helped contain theexpansion of external debt as a ratio of GDp. However, totalexternal debt in US dollaL terms rose by 14 per cent to USdollars 10,644 million at end 2003. The increase was entirelydue to an increase of US dollars 1,159 million in govemmentexternal debt as the private sector external debt declinedmarginally. It has been estimated that more than 50 per centof the increase in dollar terms was due to the sharpdepreciation of the US dollar against other major currencies,as about 43 and 3l per cent of the debts were denominated inSDR and yen, respectively. This clearly indicates thesensitivity of external debt to sharp variations in cross ratesamong major international currencies. A large part, about 95per cent of total debt, is medium and long-term debt, mainlyconsisting of concessional debt of the government (95 percent), The government's non-concessional external debtremained almost unchanged at US dollars 219 million.containing non-concessional external debt is crucial forensuring external debt sustainability, as well as forencouraging concessional foreign assistance. Foreign debtservlce payments as a ratio of receipts from export of goodsand services, income and private transfers declined to 9.3 percent in 2003 from 10.8 per cent in 2002, reflecting animproved debt repayment capacity of the country.

1.L 1 Financial Sector

In 2003, the financial sector was characterised by cautiousmonetary management, greater financial market stability,improved performance, and continuation of reforms andmodernisation of facilities and services. Monetary policycontinued to focus on ensuring sustainable low inflation, whilefacilitating economic recovery. Money and foreign exchangemarkets widened and deepened, while remaining liquid andstable. Policy rates were reduced further by the central Bank,taking into account the macroeconomic developments,pailicularly the steady decline in inf'lation, at a faster rate thanexpected and containment in public sector borrowingrequirements. In the fbreign exchange market the central Banklimited its interventions to preventing excessive short-termvolatility. It took advantage of higher than expected foreignexchange inflows to build up official reserves throughpurchases in the market, while keeping to the target reseruemoney path through sterilisation, using government andCentral Bank securities. In the implementation of monetarypolicy the Central Bank placed increasing reliance on moremarket oriented instruments and strategy by moving to moreactive open market operations. The CBSL also continued itseffbrts to make monetary policy operations more transparent

helping to improve credibility and predictability of themonetary policy stance.The market responded positively by reducing interestrates. There was also a decrease in volatility in market rates,an increase in credit utilisation by the private sector andexpansion in foreign exchange mar.ket activity. Over.allmonetary and credit expansion remained in line with theprogramme fargets, even though the year ended with slightlyhigher monetary growth leflecting the impact of thecontinuation of economic recovery. profitability in thefinancial sector increased with increased interest spread andenhanced volume of business, enabling an increase in thecapital base of financial institutions. Improvements in flnancialsystem soundness were further supported by the strengtheningof prudential regulations, reduction in non-performing assets,resolution of difficulties in weaker banks, and enhancement ofdisclosure and dissemination of more infor-mation. Stockmarket performance increased significantly with several keymarket indicators reaching record levels in 2003 though somereversals were seen towards the end of the year due touncertainty caused by political developments. The domesticdebt market expanded with increasing reliance on marketoriented instruments in mobilising resources fbr governmentdeficit financing and developing a long-rerm benchmark yieldcurve for government securities.Meanwhile, reforms aimed at improving efficiency,competition, stability and resilience of the financial sectorwere continued in 2003. Progress was made in enacting newlegislation and making necessary amendment to the existinglegislation with a view to developing a suppor-tive legalfiamework compatible with the requirements of a modern,sound financial system. Measures were also taken to improvethe stability, safety and efficiency of the payments andsettlement system with the establishment of a Real Time GrossSettlement (RTGS) system and moving to a ScriplessSecurities Settlement (SSS) system in government securities.Nevertheless continuation of concerted efforts isnecessary to further strengthen the monetary policytransmission mechanism and the resilience of the financialsystem and to develop the domestic debt market, par-ticularlyby reducing non-performing loans, through better riskmanagement and credit culture, narrowing the high interestrate spread through strong competition, and developing thelong-term benchmark yield curve through improvements inpublic debt management.Monetary Policy: The monetary policy stance ofbalancing the fbcus on achieving sustainable low inflationwhile supporting the economic recovery continued in 2003.The high inflation, coupled with negative economic growth,experienced in 2001 was reversed to some extent in 2002 witha deceleration in inflation and a positive economic growth,although the achievements were below expectations as well asdesirable levels. Therefore, the challenge to monetarymanagement in 2003 was to consolidate achievements in the

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 200335

Part IChapter 1 - ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, OUTLOOK, ISSUES AND POLICIES

previous year with a further reduction in inf'lation to a lowlevel, while providing necessary support to strengthen the

economic recovery. The monetary policy stance aimed at

achieving this goal led to reductions in policy rates cautiously

and gradually. Accordingly, key policy rates (i.e., Repurchase

Rate, Reverse Repurchase Rate and Bank Rate) were cut,

broadly in line with the pace of disinflation, while keeping real

interest rates positive. Meanwhile, the independently floating

exchange rate regime was continued, which served well in

building external reserves and absorbing some of the pressuretiom large inflows, paLticularly under the services, and capital

and financial accounts in the balance of payments. The excesspart of the resulting rupee liquidity from the purchase of

foreign currency by the Central Bank was sterilised through

open market operations in order to contain reserve money

expansion within the int'lation containing target envisaged inthe annual monetary programme. In absorbing the excessliquidity, the Central Bank issued its own securities as its

holdings of government securities became inadequate in the

second half of the year, demonstrating its commitment to

containing excessive monetary expansion and hence potentialinflation in the future.The Central Bank reduced in four steps (January, May,August and October) its Repurchase (Repo) and Reverse

Repurchase (Reverse Repo) rates by a total of 215 and 325

basis points, respectively, and narrowed the margin between

the two policy rates by 50 basis points. This was on top of thereduction of 225 basis points in these rates effected in 2002,facilitating the downward shift in the yield curve. The Bank

Rate was also reduced from 18.0 per cent to 15.0 per cent in

order to keep it with the trends in the Central Bank's otherpolicy rates. A number of factors justified and supported these

reductions in policy rates: the continuing decline in inflation

and market inflationary expectations, monetary expansion

remaining in line with the desired levels despite excess marketliquidity, successful containment of public sector bonowings,

non-excessive expansion in private sector credit, increased

relative stability in the foreign exchange market, continuation

of output gap, albeit decreasing gradually, and the downward

movements in some international interest rates. The spreadbetween the Central Bank's Repo and Reverse Repo was

reduced to 150 basis points from 200 basis points by taking

into account the reduced volatility in money market rates, thelow spread between bid and offer rates in the market and the

downward shifting of Repo and Reverse Repo rates to singledigit levels. These reductions in policy rates and continuattonof liquidity in the market resulted in gradual reductions in all

market interest rates, though some lending rates were slow toadjust. Nevertheless, a faster decline in inflation than

reductions in some nominal interest rates resulted in a rise in

the corresponding real interest rates.In the implementation of monetary policy, a monetarytargetting framework, with reserve money as the mainoperating target, broad money supply as the intermediate

target, and economic and price stability as the ultimate target,was continued in 20031. The Monetary Policy Committee(MPC) met at least once a month to consider monetary

developments and to make recommendations to the MonetaryBoard. A series of economic variables representing

developments in the monetary and financial sector as well as

in external, fiscal and real sectors were monitored closely and

analysed thoroughly in the process of monetary policy

determination. Steps were taken in 2003 to further strengthen

the market orientation in the implementation of monetarypolicy and enhance the transparency, predictability and

credibility of monetary management. The Central Bank movedto a system of more active open market operations (OMO) in

March 2003 allowing market forces to play a greater role in

the determination of interest rates. Under the new system, theBank would decide the quantum involved in OMO, while

allowing the market to determine the interest rates through an

auctioning system. Meanwhile, an interest rate con'idor folmedby the Bank's Repo and Reverse Repo rates with theavailability of stand-by facilities at these boundary rates, is

used to prevent potential excessive volatility in the short-termmarket interest rates, given the stage of development of themoney market in the country. This corridor is reviewed

continuously and revised whenever necessary, signalling to the

market the monetary policy stance and the desired direction of

rnterest rate movements,The new OMO system worked smoothly, enabling the

Central Bank to contain reserve money expansion within thedesirable path with improved liquidity management andreduced volatility in the market rates. It provided an

opportunity to the money market participants to participate in

the determination of effective interest rates in OMO, while

encouraging them to improve their own liquidity management

and rate of return. The basis for computing the statutoryreserve requirement (SRR) to be maintained by the

commercial banks with the Central Bank was changed in April

2003 from the deposit and vault cash balances related to asingle working day to the corresponding weekly average

values. This change not only enabled to improve the accuracyof daily market liquidity estimates, which are vital for the

effrcient working of OMO, but also improved the effectivenessof SRR as a monetary policy instrument. Monetary

projections, along with explanatory notes, were posted on theCentral Bank's website, increasing the availability of

information on monetaty management. The Central Bank also

started to release an advance release calendar announcing the

dates of monthly press releases on monetary policy decisions.Under this, the Bank commenced releasing a monthly

monetary policy statement giving reasons behind the policy

decisions in order to increase the market's awareness, which

is necessary for improving market stability.

Daily Operations and Interest Rate Stability

As expected under the present system, the stability of interbank call money Lates was maintained within the conidor(Chart). However, market rates moved near the Repurchaserate, as the market formed a perception of a continueddownward trend in lates, due to the downward trend inintlation and the persistent excess liquidity, On average,excess liquidity was alound Rs. 9 billion, though asignificant var:iation was observed at times, The Bankconducted repurchase auctions on every working day toabsorb excess liquidity, except on one day on which marketliquidify was in balancre. Howel'er, the amount ofi.ered at theauction was lower than the estimated excess liquidity. Thiswas on account of several considerations includin_g (a)pos-sible en'ors in liquidity assessment (b) the leewaybetween the actual l'eserve money and target and (c) thevicws of market participants that a certain level of excessliquidity should be nraintained in the market in view ofcertain ngidities, such as lending limits imposed by bankson each other, On average, the amount offered was aboutRs. 3,7 biltion less than the estimated liqLridiry surplus. Thebalance was absorbed under the standing facilities.Under the present system of monetary operations, asthe Cenlral Bank actively miuiages market liquidity, therehas never been a shortage of liquidity'except on oneoccasion when the surplus was closer to zer.o. Nevertheless,reverse t'epurchase facilities undel standing tirciltties wereutilised on two days in April and three days in May (onaverage less than I{s.2 biilion per day). This was areflection of rigiclities in thc marker. When the liquiclitysurplus is concentrated in a f'erv banks, some banks find it

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Reoort - 200337

Parl IChapter 1 - ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, OUTLOOK, ISSUES AND POLICIES

difficult to raise funds in the inter bank market due to thelimits some banks have on lending to others. Such limits

impose a constraint on the snrooth operations of banks when

thele are banks u'rlh unsustainably high deticit, which are

f'unded on an overnight basis.

One of the challenges successfully firced by the CentralBank rvas maintaining interest r:rte stability during the

fe stive seasons rn Marctr/Apnl and December. A common

experience, bef ore the introduction of the present system,

was a sharp increase in interbank rates durtng this period

due to seasonal demand fbr liquidity. This ivas avoided in

2003 by appropriate actions by the CBSL under the new

system. The standard deviation of the rveighted avera-9e call

money rate in April 2003, rvas 0,14 per cent, while it was

0.52 per cent in 2002 and 0.65 per cent in 2001. Similru'ly,

it was 0.07 pe r cent in December 2003 while it rvas 0.33 petcent in December 2001. The standard deviation inDecember 2002 was comparable with that in 2003 asliquiditv nranagement in a proactive manner wascommenced durin-q the second half of that year in

preparation fol the launching of the present system of

monetary operations.

Assessmcnt of Market Liquidity

The assessment of matket liquidity u'hich plavs a majorrole in the determination of the Central Bank daily

operations in the market has been reasonably accurate. On

a\/erage, about 3 times out of 4. the error nrilrgin of the

assessment rvas less than i0 per cent, while 4 times out of5, it was less fian l5 pel cent. Anothet measule of theeror nargin, the RMSE (Root Mean Squated PercentageError) was around l2 per cent. A certain level of etr'or is

unavoidable. as banks are not required to maintain 100 per

cent of reserves on a daily basis. They could maintain a

short position at the beginning of [he resen'e week andcovel the deficit during the rest of the rveek. The

behaviour of banks in this regard cannot be predicted withcertaintl,though errors u'ere minimised thlough a

persuasive dialogue u'ith banks. Another' factor whichcontributed to the en'or margin wus the difficulty inestimating net curlency rvithdrarvals fiom the CentralBank, llorvever, this estimation has gradually beenimproved by contactrng major banks every morning toobtain inlbrmation on their planned currency transaclionsivith the Central Bank. In addition, the method ofcomputing the statutory reserve requirements andreporting dates of deposits liabilities ior the same were

changed to improve the accuracy of liquidity assessment.However, there is still scope tbl further improving the

Box 4 (contd.)

estimation of liquidity. Commercial banks too could

contribute by improving their own liquidity assessments

submitted to the Central Bank, which would be mutually

beneficial.

Managernent of Excess Liquidity

Another challenge faced by the Central Bank under the

present system was to trbsot'b a part of the excess liquidity

on il permanent basis, rather than on a daily basis. Excessliquidity increased from around Rs. l0 billion to Rs. l3billion by mid N{arch 2003. Except during the New Year

season l}om late March to Apdl and a ferv days aroulid

Wesak in May, the surplus remained well above Rs. l0billion during the early period under the present systemindicating a long-term liquidity surplus. The following

measures were implemented to reduce the liquidity sulplus

to around Rs.3-5 billion. There wtts a market consensus thitt

around Rs.3-5 billion excess iiquidity should be maintainedto ensure l smooth f'lolv of transactions in the mat'ket.i. Outright sales of Tleasury bills through auctions

and direct sales.ii, Non-renewals of maturing Treasury bills held by

the Centrll Bank,iii. Retirrng Treasury bills held by the Central Bank

rvhen the go\/ernment was in a position to do so.

The surplus \r'rIS thereby brought do$'n to belorv Rs. 5billion by mid October 2003. TheLeafier, the surplus wasgenerally maintained around this level until the seasonalincrelse after Christmns, The Central Bank holdings of

Treasury bills (net of repurchases), which were as hi-qh as

Rs.29.5 billion at the commencement of the present system

and moved up to Rs.37.0 billion in mid April, declined to

belon,Rs. 4 billion by mid September 2003. Treasury bills

to a fhce valLre of Rs,1.7 biilion wele sold through outright

auctions though the success of these auctions was limited,In addition, Trcasury bills to a thce viilue of Rs. 0.7 billion

were sold through dilect dealing in 2003, Treasury bills to

a face value of Rs. 6.0 billion out of CBSL holdings were

retired prior to their maturity in Septembe r 2003.

The active operations to reduce excess iiquidity had tobe carlied out in the face of a tendency for liquidity

expansicln due to the intlow of fbreign exchange into thecountry. Central Bank's purchases of foleign exchangefrom the malket to build its reserves (US doilars 375

million)injected about Rs. 35,6 billion of rupee liquidity to

the mu'ket in 2003, In addition, net foreign loan receipts to

the government were about Rs. 7 billion. These inflorvs.indicrted the possibility that the Bankls holdings of

The continuation of the independently floating exchange

rate regime enabled the Central Bank to focus more clearly oneconomic and price stability in the conduct of monetary

policy. The floating exchange rate system served well in 2003,

absorbing part of the pressure from increased foreign inflows,enabling the Central Bank to purchase of US dollars 375million in the market to build up official reserves' It also

helped in ensuring the country's external competitiveness,

mainly in an international environment where the US dollar,

the main cunency used for the country's external transactions,

depreciated sharply against all other major currencies. The

activities in the foreign exchange market expanded further,

particularly the volume and maturity of forward transactions,

expanding risk management facilities to market participants

and strengthening the stability in the exchange rate- Theforeign exchange market remained stable, permitting theCentral Bank to enhance limits on net oPen positions of

commercial banks, giving them greater flexibility in their

operatlons,Money Supply: Growth in monetary and credit variables

was broadly in line with monetary targets envisaged under the

overall macroeconomic framework aimed at economic growthwith price stability. As expected, large contributions to

monetary expansion were made by expanding private sectorcredit and rising net foreign assets of the banking sector,

supporting the objectives of private sector led growth and

building up extemal reserves. Reserve money grew by Rs.l5

billion (12 per cent) to Rs.l4l billion, in comparison with an

increase of Rs.l4 billion (12 per cent) in 2002. From the

perspective of contributory factors, the increase was entirely

due to an increase in the net foreign assets of the Central Bank

(Rs.47 billion), partly offset by a decline in its net domestic

assets (NDA) (Rs.32 billion). The reduction in NDA was

caused by the sterilisation policy followed through OMO,

Part Ichapter 1 - ECoNoMlc PERFORMANOE, ourlooK, tssuES AND poLtclES

which reduced the Central Bank's holding of Treasury bills byRs.29 billion in 2003, On the use side, a major part of theincrease in reserve money was reflected in the currency incirculation (Rs.l0 billion), partly on account of increasedeconomic activity and increasing money demand in the Northand the East with normalisation of economic activity, TheDebits Tax on deposit withdrawals may also have increasedcuffency holdings to some degree. The balance Rs.5 billion inthe increase was recorded in the deposits of commercial bankswith the Central Bank reflecting increased SRR with anexpanding deposit base.The growth in consolidated broad money supply (MrJ,which remained in a range of 12-13 per cent duLing the firstthree quarters, accelerated during the fourth quarteL, reaching15.3 per cent at end 2003, mainly due to an increase in creditto the private sector. The increase in money supply (Rs.95billion) was mainly dliven by increased NFA of the bankingsystem (Rs.56 billion), reflecting a large surplus in the BOpand the increase in privare sector credit (Rs.75 billion or 16.9per cent) caused by increased credit demand in all majoreconomic sectors with the economic recovery. High incr.easesof private sector credit utilisation were mainly recorded intourism, agriculture, manufacturing, housing and consumption.A reduction in public sector credit (about Rs,24 billion) partlyoffset the effect of increases in private sector credit, faciritatingmonetary management. Net credit to the government (NCG)declined by about Rs.17 billion with improved fiscalconsolidation, while the credit utilisation by publiccorporations declined by about Rs.7 billion, mainly reflectingimprovements in the cash f-lows of the CpC and CEB and therestructuring of CWE's credit through the issue of Treasurybonds.Monetary aggregates (Mo) in the financial survey, whichinclude the activities of licensed specialised banks and flnancecompanies in addition to the activities of the Central Bank andcommercial banks, recorded similar trends in 2003. Monetarygrowth, as measured by the increase in Mo, recorded an annualgrowth of l6 per cent in 2003 compared with the 14 per centgrowth in 2002. NCG rose by Rs.4 billion in rhe financialsurvey, in contrast to a decrease by Rs.2l billion in themonetary survey, as the investment by LSBs in governmentpaper increased by Rs.26 billion, mainly due to a substantialincrease in investments by the NSB. This offset the reductionof NCG from the Central Bank and commercial banks, Creditexpansion to the private sector in the tinancial survey rose byRs.96 billion (16.8 per cent) in 2003 as against Rs.53 billionin2002, reflecting significant resource flows to support privatesector economic activity.In 2003, reserve money and the money multiplier bothcontributed to the expansion of money supply. The moneymultiplier (Mrn multiplier) increasec! slightly from 4,92 in2002 to 5.08 per cent, while reserve money rose by Rs.l5billion. A rising share of foreign currency deposits, which zuenot subject to SRR, and a decline in currency to deposits,

enabled the banks to create more deposits and credit, therebycontributing to raise the money multiplier. Meanwhile, theincome velocity of money (i.e,, GDP at market prices/Mrn)declined to 2.65 in 2003 from 2.70 in 2002, reflectingdeclining infl ationary expectations, expanding financial assets,and financial deepening in the economy.Interest Rates: The declining trend in market interestrates continued in 2003, despite some marginal reversalstowards end of the year, shifting the entire interest ratestructure downward and reducing active policy rates, moneymarket rates and yields on government securities to singledigit levels. The major contributory factors for the reductionin market rates were reductions in the Central Bank's policyrates, greater fiscal discipline and public enterprise reformsthat reduced demand fbr domestic rupee funds, increasedmarket liquidity and reduced inflationary expectations.Following the reduction in policy rates, call market ratesdeclined by 280 basis points (bps) to 7.59 per cenr in 2003while its variation remained low, reflecting a greater stabilityin the money market. Similarly, decreases were seen in theovernight Sri Lanka Intelbank Offered Rate (SLIBOR) (294bps) and the Average Weighted Plime Lending Rate (AWPR)(298 bps). All Treasury bill auctions were oversubscribed andtheir yields decleased by 257 -267 bps to a range of I .24 - 7 .35per cent. The secondary market yields on governmentsecurities also recorded similal declines and resulted in aflatter yield curve indicating market expectations of lowerinflation in the medium term. In this environment thegovernment was able to issue Treasury bonds with longmaturity (10, 15 and 20 years) at low rates of 6.08 - 9.08 percent, These issues helped to develop a benchmark yield curve,which was a long overdue necessity in developing thedomestic debt market. In general, commercisl banks reducedtheir average lending rates less than their average deposit rates.The spread computed based on average interest yield andaverage interest cost, declined by about 50 bps towards the endof 2003, but was still high (see Box l9). The continuation ofa high interest spread of 4 - 5 percentage points has raisedconcerns regarding the efficiency and competitiveness of thebanking system. Major causal factors explaining this highspread are: high non-performing loans (NPLs), increasedoperational costs, high dependence on interest income, the lackof instruments with floating rates, weak competitiveness andinadequate availability of infolmation, The Cenh.al Bank hasaheady begun to publish bankwise interest rates and charges,while encouraging banks to publish their own rates in order toreduce the splead through competition. Continuation offlnancial sector reforms, improvement in risk management ofcommercial banks, improving credit repayment culture,strengthening competition and encouraging mergers arenecessary to bring down the spread to a level comparable withother countries, i,e., 100 - 200 bps.Internatirrnally, interest rates remained low and evendeclined in some countries in 2003 as maior countries eased

monetary policy to assist the recovery of their economies. For

example the benchmark United States Federal Funds rate was

cut by 25 bps to a 4O-year low level of 1.00 per cent in 2003.Activity in the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) increased

significantly, with some market indicators registering recordlevels, reflecting the improved investor confidence and

increased corporate sector profitability with the economic

recovery. Heavy trading in the CSE was mainly driven by

local investors, encouraged by high liquidity in the market and

the decline of returns from fixed income securities, The All

Share Price Index and the Milanka Price Index rose by 74 and

88 per cent, reaching their highest levels in October 2003, butdeclined by about 25 per cent during the balance period,

reflecting the market uncertainty that resulted from political

developments,The improvement in the economy was also reflected in

the non-bank financial institutions such as finance companies,leasing companies, merchant banks etc. The decreasing

interest rates and the active share market had a beneficialeffect on the operations of these institutions' Finance

companies, which are a significant source of funds for

economic activity, saw their assets rise by 20 per cent in 2003.

Much of this increase was channeled through leasing and hire

purchase finance, encouraging economic activity on the partof economic agents who did not have easy access to bank

finance. The Central Bank took steps to strengthen the stability

and resilience of finance companies by raising the required

capital adequacy ratio to 10 per cent. The insurance sector too

expanded, although insurance penetration remains very low inSri Lankar . Clearly, there exists considerable potential for

expansion in this industry. A notable development was thedivestiture by the government of Sri Lanka InsuranceCorporation (SLIC) to the private sector. With this, the

government has almost completely moved away from direct

involvement in the insurance industry. In an environment of

decreasing interest rates and heightened economic activity,

merchant banks had record levels of operations and pLofits.This has helped to increase their capital and reserves, and

consequently their ability to withstand temporary economic

downtums. Their increasing activity also helps to broaden and

deepen the financial sector. The resurgence in the stock

market, after a number of dull years, helped to improve the

performance of Unit Trusts.

A lengthening yield curve, shifting downward

Progress was also achieved in financial sector reforms

and strengthening financial system stability, though progress

has been slow in some areas. The introduction of the RTGS

system and the SSS system for government securities by the

Central Bank has contributed to increasing the etficiency and

reducing the risks in the payments and settlements system in

the country. Action was also taken by the Central Bank to

enhance the resilience of banks to risk by e xpanding the scopeof prudential supervision. Measures taken in this regard

included an increase of the minimum capital adequacy ratio,

the imposition of key prudential requirements on foreign

currency banking units and more prudent valuation of

collateral. Greater transparency was also instituted through arequirement that all banks should publish their quarterly

accounts. Legal reforms were initiated to increase the

efficiency of the financial system and to improve regulatory

oversight. Nevertheless, progress in reducing the level of non-

performing assets of banks, narrowing interest rate spreads'

restructuring state banks and introducing asset management

companies was below expectations. Similarly, more action is

required to increase competition in the financial market, for

instance, by the development of the private debt market.l,l2 Economic Outlook for 2004 andMedium-Term Prospects

faced by the country is to attain permanent peace and lay thetoundation for sustainable high quality economic growth. Thesuccess of these endeavours wrll depend mainly on theprogress in the ongoing peace process, strengtheningmacroeconomic management, the speed and effectiveness ofimplementing structural reforms, development ofinfrastructure facilities, particularly power and transport,effective utilisation of fbreign donor assistance, a conduciveexternal environment and favourable weather conditions.All these factors, except the last two, are directly underthe control of the country, if a national consensus can bereached and the necessary measures are implementedeft'ectively and in time, Given the high level of public debt andits adverse impact, strengthening macroeconomic managementhas to be centred on a medium-term fiscal sustainabilitystrategy, consisting of a steady and faster reduction in thebudget deficit and public debt as committed ro in the FiscalManagement (Responsibility) Act. This would be attainedthrough an enhancement of government revenue and arationalisation of recurrent expenditure, while maintainingadequate public investment, particularly on infrastructuredevelopment. A time-bound comprehensive structural refbrmprogramme, consisting of reforms in all major sectors asidentified in Sri Lanka's PRSP, i.e., labour market, regulatorysystem, utilities, civil service, public enterprises, financialsector, pensions and judicial system, will reinforce theimprovement in macroeconomic management and enhanceeconomic growth prospects by expanding capacity andimproving factor productivity in the economy. Such measureswill also help to complete successfully the major donorassistance programmes such as the PRGF with the IMF, thePRSC with the World Bank and the country assistancestrategies with the ADB and Japan, thereby strengthening thecountry's policy credibility, encouraging more donor supportand attracting long-term foleign private investment inflows.Consequently, improvements in macroeconomic managementand the eft'ective implementation of structural lefbrms withadequate emphasis on enhancing market access to the poor andthereby expanding their economic opportunities, will move thecountry to a sustainable high growth path with trickle downeffects, enabling the country to resolve the majormacroeconomic problems, viz., poverty, unemployment andinf'lation on a more sustainable basis.An early and lasting peace is essential to ensure thecountry's future economic prosperity. Any delay on that fiontwill deny the nation the immense potential benefits of peace.A reversal of the ongoing process will exelt even greatereconomic, political and social costs, which the country cannotafford to bear. Therefore, every ef'fort needs to be made to frnda lasting political solution to the issue through building anational consensus. Further, building consensus on keypolitical and economic issues among the major politicalparties, institutions and various segments of society, as anational priority, is critical to achieving the primary objectives

of the country, viz, peace and sustainable economicdevelopment with greater equity, raising the living standard ofthe entire nation and strengthening the resilience of theeconomy to face potential external shocks.

World Economic Outlook for 2004

The on going recovery is expected to strengthen the globaleconomy further in 2004. The major factors that wouldcontribute to a stronger recovery are the economic stimuluspolicies already in the pipeline, improving corporate profitswith a strong rebound in corporate projects, renewed strengthsin the IT sector, wealth effects from the rise in equity markets,further pick up in inventories and declining geopolitical risks.The World Economic Outlook published by the IMF in April2004, revised the global growth forecast for 2004 upwards by0.7 percentage points to 4,6 per cent, from the earlier projection

made in September 2003. The major downside risks to theseprojections are a disorderly resolution of global imbalances,notably the large US current account deficit and surpluseselsewhere, the medium-term fiscal situations in many industnaland emerging market economies, and managing the eventualtransition to higher interest rates.The recovery is projected to be strongest in the US withGDP growth rebounding to 4,6 per cent in 2004 from 3.1 percent in 2003. Continued strong productivity growth and theimpact of past fiscal and monetary stimulus would contributeto the stronger recovery in 2004.In Japan, GDP growth isprojected a;t3.4 pel cent in2004, an upward revision by 0.9percentage points from the earlier projection, and the highestgrowth since 1996. The recovery in Japan would be mainlydriven by external demand, notably fiom China, supported bydomestic investment and a recovery in consumption. Eventhough the growth in the Euro area is also projected to behigher, 1.7 per cent, from the 0.4 per cent rn 2003, this is adownward revision by 0.3 percentage points from the earlierprojection, The major concern is the sharp appreciation of the

euro, which would slow down the demand for exports from theEuro area. The signs of a pick up in fixed investments andrising financial markets are likely to suppolt the gradualrecovery in the Euro area. GDP growth in emelging marketsand developing countdes has been marked in almost everyregion. The growth momentum has been particularly strong indeveloping Asia, where GDP growth is projected at 7.4 percent in 2004, making it the world's f'astest growing region,Accommodative macroeconomic policies, competitive

exchange rates, and the recovery in the IT sector would mainlycontribute to the growth in developing Asia. In particular,buoyant growth in China and India is expected to provideimportant support to economic activity in countries within andoutside region. However, potential downside risks persist,including remaining geopolitical uncertainties, oil pricevolatility and viral epidemics, most recently the avian flu.Increasingly rapid global recovery, combined with aweaker US doliar', would feed through to commodity pricesin 2004. The current volatility in oil prices indicates that

average crude oil prices in2004 would be around US dollars

Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 200343

Part IChapter 1 - ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, OUTLOOK, ISSUES AND POLICIES

32 per barrel, which is an upward revision of the earlierprojection by US dollar 6.50 per barrel. Part of the upwardrevision reflects the depreciation of the US dollar, while theremainder reflects higher than expected demand, particularlyfrom the US and China and the continued low level ofinventories. The adverse impact of higher oil prices on oilimporting developing countries would be partly offset byeven higher growth expected in non-fuel commodity prices.Non-fuel commodity prices have already increased, withmetals, food and agricultural raw materials experiencing thelargest gains.Despite the expected global recovery and highercommodity prices, inflation in industrial countries has beenprojected to fall to 1.7 per cent in2004 from the estimated 1.8per cent in 2003. The lower projection reflects continuedexcess capacity, weak labour markets and limited price fixingpower of producers in the face of strong domestic and globalcompetition. However, any upward prospects to global growthin the short run would impose a downside risk to the projectedlower inflation in advanced economies. In emerging market

and developing economies, inflationary pressures are expectedto edge upwards in 2004.The growth momentum in international trade is expectedto continue in 2004. The world trade volume has beenprojected to grow by 6.8 per cent in 2004, the highest growthsince 2000. The rapid recovery in the growth of importsreflects the projected growth in exports, particularly exportsfrom advanced economies, which are expected to glow by 5.7per cent in comparison to 3.5 per cent in 2003. Exports fromemerging markets and developing countries are also expectedto grow by 8.1 per cent, lower than the growth of 8.7 per centin 2003, largely due to expected lower exports from fuelexporting countries. Import growth by advanced economies

has been projected at5.7 per cent in2004 in comparison to 3.4per cent in 2003. Impofts by emerging ma:'kets and developingcountries are expected to grow by an even higher rate of 10,2per cent in 2004, reflecting growing trade among thesecountries.World trade negotiations are expected to regain somemomentum in 2004, although significant obstacles toachieving a meaningful agreement remain. A successfulcompletion of the Doha round negotiations is particularlyimportant for developing countries to which two thirds ofpotential gains would accrue through increasing market access.However, the major downside risk to the rapid recovery inglobal trade is the global imbalance, which increases thepotential fbr protectionist pressures.The current low global interest rates are expected to risein 2004 but the timing and speed of future moves remainsubject to considerable uncertainty. There is also a risk thatasset prices, which have already rebounded due to the lowinterest rate environment, could go ahead of fundamentals.Any future interest rate rises, especially if abrupt, could leadto asset price volatility and possibly adversely affect the

recovery. This is a particular concern in countries withbuoyant property markets.The major downside risk to the global recovery is thedisorderly resolution of global imbalances. Key elementsfacilitating an orderly adjustment of imbalances include: acredible plan by the US to restore budgetary balance over themedium term; stepping up the face of structural reforms in theEuro area; banking and corporate sector refbrms in Japan; and

a gradual shift towards greater tlexibility in exchange rates inmost emerging markets, combined with additional structuralreforms to support domestic demand. In the implementation ofthese adjustments, policy makers, palticularly in majorindustrial countries, need to ensure that the recovery in theworld economy is sustained through a credible and cooperative

approach to addressing global economic imbalances. The lackof a credible and cooperative strategy among them to address

the above problems remains a significant downside ilsk to theprojected recovery in the global economy,The outlook for the world economy in2004 indicates that

the expected developments would, in net terms, be positive forSri Lanka. The continuing economic growth in the US andJapan, along with higher growth rn the EU, would help toexpand the demand for Sri Lanka's major exports. This, withthe expected expansion in the Indian economy, would lead togreater output in port related services. The growinginternational income would also help sustain the continuingexpansion in the tourist industry. International pricemovements are generally expected to move in Sri Lanka'sfavour, although the high price of petroleum products are amatter tor concern.

Sri Lanka's Economic Outlook 2004Despite the favourable external environment, themacroeconomic prospects tor 2004 are mixed. mainly due tothe continuation of dry weather conditions experienced since

the last quarter of 2003, and the adverse impact of the politicaldevelopments that led to a general election in April 2004.However, some of the impact that resulted from the politicaldevelopments could be minimised if the government elected inApril takes effective action early to arrest policy slippages,catch up with delays in project implementation and economicreform, and improve investor confidence and external donor

support. The projections under the baseline scenario, which areprepared on the assumption of such early action andnormalisation of weather conditions in the second half of theyear, indicate a moderate economic growth, investmentexpansion, moderate inflation, stability in the exchange rate,creation of more employment opportunities, enhancement ofextemal reserves, improvement in macroeconomic stability andstrengthening of the resilience of the economy. Theachievement of these goals in 2004 is necessary to lay therequired fbundation for a sustainable high growth with greaterstability and equity in the medium to long-term. Thus, the earlyattention and strong commitment of policy makers, with

44Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2003

Part Ichapter 1 - EcoNoMlc PERFORMANCE, ourlooK, rssuES AND poLrclEs

effective action, are not only critical to ensure a bettereconomic outlook in2004, but also to improve economicprospects in the medium to long-term.The realisation of these results is challenging anddepends primarily on five factors, which are broadly underthe control of the country, They are: (a) continuation of theceasefire and early resumption of negotiations for a politicalsettlement; (b) continuation of the improvement inmacroeconomlc management with policy adjustments centredaround a medium-term sustainable fiscal strategy; (c)effective implementation of structural reforms aimed atremoving constraints on investment expansion andproductivity improvement without delays or reversals; (d)mobilisation of adequate external concessional assistancewith the completion of requirements under the pRGF-EFFand PRSC as soon as possible; and (e) undertaking aneffective public awareness programme explaining thebenetits of peace, policy adjustments, structural reforms andextemal donor support, as well as the cost of not undertakingthem or delaying them, to build a strong supportiveconstituency for these.Growth: Real output (i.e., GDP at constant prices) isexpected to grow by around 5.5 per cent in 2004 as acomposite outcome of sectoral growth of 6.1 per cent inServices,5.8 per cent in Industry and 0.6 per cent inAgliculture. This is lower than the growth rate of 6 per centprojected earlier for 2004, mainly due to the continuation ofdry weather conditions at the beginning of 2004 adverselyaff'ecting agricultural production and hydropower generation.The Services sector is projected to account fbr 69 per cent ofthe overall growth in GDP, benefitting from a continuation ofthe growth momentum in trade, telecommunications, financialservices, tourism and port services. The Industry sector isexpected to account for a higher relative share of about 29 percent in total GDP growth, compared with 25 per cent in 2003,reflecting growth in the manufacturing sector and expansionin construction activities, Higher dependence on high-costthermal power generation due to poor rainf'all would limit thepotential high growth in the industrial sector and hence therealisation of maximum benefits from the favourable externaleconomic environment. The contribution from Agriculture tothe overall economic growth in2004 is expected to be as lowas 2 per cent due to the impact of adverse weather on paddycultivation and some other short-term agricultur.al crops.On the aggregate demand side, the economic growth in2004 is expected to be driven by the increasing exportdemand, continuation of the momentum in domestic privateconsumption and a recovery in investment, albeit marginal.The export sector is expected to benefit from improved growthprospects in the USA and Japan, enhanced trade concessionsfrom the EU to Sri Lankar and expanding opportunities under1 The special incentive arrangement (SlA) granted by the EU forSri Lankan exports with effect from February 2OO4 provides anopportunity for exporters to increase their exports to the EU.

bilateral trade agreements, particularly with India. Thecontinuation of the ceaseflre, increased real per capita incomeand the low interest rate regime would hetp to continue themomentum in domestic private consumer demand. Investmentis expected to record at least a moderate improvement,benefitting from relatively low interest rates and availableconcessional external project financing. However, thecontinuation of market friendly economic refbrms and timelyimplementation of public sector infrastructure developmentprojects are necessary for achieving the expected improvementin investment. The achievement of the expected reduction inthe current account deficit in the budget fbr 2004, continuationof the upward trend in private transfers supported mainly byincreasing foreign remittances, improvement in corporatesector profitability, rising per capita income and continuationof positive real interest rates will help to improve nationalsavings. However, improvement in foleign aid utilisation andstrengthening of foreign investor confidence are critical toachieving the expected improvement in investment as theprojected improvement in national savings would not besufficient to offset the existing resource gap betweeninvestment and savings.Inflation: Inflation based on consumer price indices isestimated to be in a range of 5 - 6 per cent in 2004. This isconsistent with the inf'lation rate expected earlier under themedium-term stabilisation programme despite unenvisagedcost-push factors and a temporary reduction in supply of somedomestic food crops due to the drought. A continuation ofhigher petroleum prices in the international market and wageincreases exceeding productivity improvements would resultin cost-push inf'lationary pressures in 2004. Meanwhile, short-term supply shortages resulting from reductions in paddy andsome other agricultural food crops could also add pressure onprices. In this context, a continuation of a cautious monetarypolicy, supported by prudent fiscal policy and prevention offurther excessive wage increases, is necessary to consolidatethe recent achievements on the pnce stability front by reducinginflation, as well as inflation expectations, steadily. Suchmeasures would also help to further strengthen exchange ratestability and hence to prevent moving towards a potentialvicious circle between inflation and exchange ratedepreciation, as well as between inflation and excessive wagelncreases.Employment: Expected economic growth and expansionin investment are expected to generate more employmentopportunities in 2004 primarily in the private sector. However,the expected new job opportunities are unlikely to be sufficientto cover the new entrants to the labour market (about 12J,000persons) in2004 and reduce the existing unemployment (about650,000) significantly. Meanwhile, the continuation of SriLankans leaving for foreign employment would provide a

saf-ety valve for releasing a part of the prcssure in the domesticlabour market, as was experienced in the past. Reflecting theseexpected developments in the labour market, unemployment

Part IChapter 1 - ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, OUTLOOK, ISSUES AND POLICIES

is estimated to be in a range of 7.0 - 8.0 per cent in 2004.

However, any attempt to find a short-term solution to the

unemployment issue by recruiting to the public sector, which

is already over statfed, is not only an unsustainable solution to

the problem, but will also increase the fiscal deficit and public

debt if not supported with adequate government revenue

enhancing measures, reversing the recent achievements under

the fiscal consolidation process. Hence, the long-term cost of

such a measure will be enormous.External Sector: Improvements in the external sector are

expected to continue in 2004, benefitting from potential high

demand for exports, the tourism boom, expansion in portactivities, continuation of private remittances, higherutilisation of foreign assistance and foreign investmentinflows. Despite the expected increase in the trade deficit,

particularly due to increases in domestic investment demand,

food imports and high oil prices, the cunent account deficit is

projected to remain at a manageable level of around 2 per centof GDP, reflecting the benefits of high inflows expectedmainly under the service account and transfers. Meanwhile,

the expected surplus in the financial and capital accounts,

reflecting increases in aid utilisation and private investmentinflows, would be sufficient to cover the current account

deficit and record a surplus (about US dollars 180 million) in

the overall BOP, albeit lower than expected earlier, for the

fourth consecutive year. Consequently, external resources of

the country are expected to increase further, strengthening

foreign exchange market stability and reducing external sector

v,rlnerability, Nevertheless, the achievement of these results

depends heavily on the continuation of the peace process,completion of the requirements under donor-supported

programmes, particularly under the PRGF-EFF, the country

assistance strategies of the World Bank and ADB, and

programmes with Japan.Under these external sector developments supported by

improved macroeconomic management, the floating exchange

rate regime is expected to operate successfully, safeguarding

the country's external competitiveness by adjusting accordingto market forces, reflecting developments in the

macroeconomic fundamentals of the country. As has been

done since January 2001, the Central Bank will continue tolimit its intervention in the foreign exchange market to prevent

undue temporary excessive volatllity and to further build upofficial external reserves by purchasing at market rates'Activities in the foreign exchange market are expected to

further expand and deepen under a competitive environmentwith expansion in instruments, services and active players'

Fiscal Policy: Budget 2004 has been formulated within

a three-year fiscal framework compatible with the medium-

term fiscal consolidation strategy envisaged in the FMRA.Accordingly, a further consolidation of the recent

achievements on the fiscal front is expected through reducingthe overall fiscal deficit, as well as domestic financing

requirement, while introducing more measures to address

structural issues facing fiscal management. In this context,

measures have been proposed for revenue enhancementthrough improvements in tax policy, as well as in tax

administration, rationalisation of recurrent expenditure, and

improvement in capital expenditure allocation and public debt

management.In line with the medium-term fiscal consolidation path,

Budget 2004 has targeted to reduce the cunent account deficit

by 2 percentage points to 1.3 per cent of GDP and the overall

fiscal deficitby 1.2 percentage points to 6.8 per cent of GDPin 2004. These reductions are expected to be achieved by

raising revenue mobilisation by 0.7 percentage points to 16.4

per cent of GDP and reducing current expenditure by l-4

percentage points to I7 .6 per cent of GDP, while raising public

investment by 0,3 percentage points to 5.3 per cent of GDP.In financing the deticit (Rs.137.9 billion), heavy reliance has

been placed on concessional external financing (Rs.59.9billion) and privatisation proceeds (Rs.13.0 billion).Accordingly, the net domestic borrowing requirement is

estimated to decrease to Rs.65 billion, leaving more domesticfinancial resources to the private sector and reducing the

pressure on the interest rate. In fact, a repayment to the

banking system of about Rs.27 billion is expected for the third

consecutive year, continuing the reversal of the practice of

inflationary deficit financing observed prior to 2002.

To enhance revenue mobilisation, lhe emphasis has beenplaced on both tax policy and improvements in tax

administration. The proposed major revenue enhancement

measures are an expansion in the tax base by reducing

exemptions under VAT, introduction of an economic service

charge of one per cent, capping cany-forward losses in income

tax, taxing partnership income, and increasing excises and

duties for certain items. Unification of VAT rates at l5 per

cent and improvement in tax audits are also expected to

improve tax collection. In the expenditure rationalisatronefforts, major emphasis has been placed on continuation of

strict controls over and streamlining recurrent expenditure'

Restrictions on recruitment to the pubtic services, except for

technical and professional categories, better targetting of

welfare programmes, containing transfers to public enterprises

and curtailing non-priority expenses are expected to continue'

Meanwhile, interest cost, the single largest expenditure item,

has been expected to be contained by improving Treasury cash

management and public debt management, and replacing high

cost callable debt, with optional maturities with low cost long-

term market borrowings.However, achieving these fiscal targets is challenging,

particularly during an election year. The situation has become

more difficult with the continuation of the drought, price increases

in some majoressential imports and dissolution of Parliament, and

the calf ing of a general election in April 2004. The Pre-election

Budgetary Position Report issued on27 February 2004 by the

Ministry of Finance, as required under the FMRA, indicates

potential deviations from the onginal targets.

46Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2003

Pad IChapter 1 - ECONOMIC PEFFORMANCE, OUTLOOK, TSSUES AND pOLtCtES

Revised estimates given in this Report indicate a higheroverall fiscal deficit and a larger domestic borrowingrequirement than expected in the Budget due to a potentialrevenue shortfall, expenditure overruns and a shortfall inforeign financing. A potential revenue shortfall of about Rs.l2billion is estimated, reflecting the impact of overestimation ofthe revenue base in the original budget estimates, delays inimplementation of new revenue measures and taxadministration improvement measures due to the dissolution ofParliament, and tax relief granted to contain the rising pricesof selected commodities, The Revenue Authority (RA) was tobe established to improve tax administration and simplify thetax system, enabling higher collections in income tax as wellas in VAT collection in 2004. However, the legislation toestablish the RA has had to be postponed due to thedissolution of Parliament delaying the improvement in taxadministration and hence tax collection. Under recurrentexpenditure, an overrun of about Rs.6.6 billion is expected,mainly reflecting new allocations for drought relief,corrections of salary anomalies in the health sector,expenditure on Parliamentary elections, and additionaltransf-ers to the postal and transport sectors. In contrast, capitalexpenditure has been revised downward by about Rs.7.5billion taking into account delays in investment projects dueto the General election and delays in foreign fundinganangements.Reflecting the changes in revenue and expenditureestimates, the fiscal deficit is estimated to increase by aboutRs.1 I billion to about Rs.l49 billion (7.3 per cent.of GDp), Infinancing the resource gap, a shortfall of about Rs.14 billionis estimated due to delays in disbursements in both programmefinancing and project financing. Meanwhile, an additional sumof about Rs.3 billion is expected under privatisation proceeds,reflecting a spillover of some of privatisation proceeds fromthe previous year. Finally, the increase in the deficit and theshortfall in foreign financing are expected to increase the netdomestic borrowing requirement by about Rs.22 billion toabout Rs.87 billion in 2004. The increased governmentdomestic borrowing could exert pressure on interest rates andresource availability to the private sector though it could belimited as the estimated non-bank resource availability, ataround Rs.l05 billion, is higher than the revised domesticfinancing requirement. However, achievement of even therevised fiscal estimates requires strong commitment andeffective implementation of measures after the Generalelection.Monetary Policy: The challenge to monetarymanagement in 2004 would be the continuation of etforts inmoving towards a low level of inflation, further consolidatingthe recent achievements, while supporting the economicrecovery. Accordingly, the monetary programme fbr 2004 hasbeen prepared targetting monetary expansion (Mrn) of aboutI 3.5 per cent, to be compatible with the overallmacroeconomic framework aimed at achieving economic

growth with stability. This monetary expansion would beadequate to support an economic growth of around 5.5 percent, while containing inflation to around 5 - 6 per cent in2004.Improvements in both net fbreign assets (NFA) and netdomestic assets (NDA) are expected to contribute to themonetary growth. NFA of the banking system is expected toincrease, reflecting the overall surplus expected in the BOPand contribute about 40 per cent of the increase in moneysupply in 2004. Meanwhile, the entire expansion in NDA isexpected fiom private sector credit expansion of about 15.4per cent, as the public sector is expected to make a repaymentto the banking system for the third consecutive year. Theexpected commercial bank credit increase to the private sectorof about Rs,80 billion, with additional new resources expectedfrom non-commercial bank financial institutions of aboutRs.l8 billion, would help increase private sector economicactivity including investment. The containment of thedomestic bonowing requirement in the budget, even with theincrease indicated in the Pre-election Budgetary PositionReport, and available domestic non-bank resources in theeconomy, would enable the government to reduce its liabilitiesto the banking sector by about Rs.13 billion. Similarly, despitehigher borrowing requirements of the CEB, liabilities of thepublic corporations to the commercial banks are also expectedto decline by about Rs.6 billion tn2004, particulally due to theexpected repayment by the CPC, using proceeds from theprivatisation of some of its activities. Meanwhile, the velocityof money (i.e., GDP/Mrn) is expected to remain at around 2.68reflecting low inflationary expectations. However, realisationof fiscal targets, the expected improvements in the financialposition of public corporations and the achievement of theprojected surplus in the BOP are critical to achieving thesemonetary targets.The Central Bank will continue to rely more on activeopen market operations in achieving these monetary targets byclosely and continuously monitoring developments to takeprompt action. The CBSL intends to continue expanding itspolicy instrument mix to include long-term repos, secondarymarket auctions and direct sales in order to improve liquiditymanagement under OMO. Such measures will also helpdeepen the money and capital markets, As already announcedand published in its website, the Bank will continue to issuemonthly press releases according to a pre-announced annualrelease calendar, explaining the reasons behind its monetarypolicy decisions. This will not only provide more informarionto the public, but will also improve the predictability andunderstanding of monetary policy, while improving thetransparency of monetary management.The continuation of ef'forts to reduce inflation and hence,inflation expectations is necessary in promoting long-termsustainable high growth. Low and stable inflation wouldencourage investment, by reducing uncertainty, improveresource allocation efficiency and save resources wasted inhedging against inflation. Low inflation would also support

Part Ichapter 1 - EcoNoMtc PERFORMANCE, OUTLOOK, ISSUES AND POLIC|ES

poverty alleviation efforts as the poor have to bear a relatively

higher burden of inflation due to the lack of inflation hedgingcapabilities.Risks: The economic prospects discussed above aresubject to a number of risks. Faster progress in the peaceprocess, a strong improvement in macroeconomicmanagement, acceleration of structural reforms, earlyimprovement in weather conditions, price reductions in majorimports (oil, fertiliser, textiles and wheat) in internationalmarkets and a stronger than expected recovery in the worldeconomy may improve the macroeconomic situation morethan expected under the baseline scenario described above.However, there are more downside risks than these potentialupside prospects. Any reversal of the peace process, largefiscal slippages, slowdown or reversals in economic

adjustments and structural reforms, an increase in political

uncertainty, deterioration of weather conditions or a slowdownin the recovery in the world economy could worsen themacroeconomic situation, causing severe difficulties inmacroeconomic management. Therefore, every effort must bemade to prevent adverse events that are directly under the

control of the country, while it is essential to have contingencymeasures to meet promptly, challenges arising from otherpotential developments, which are not directly under thecontrol of the country,

Medium-Term Macroeconomic Prospects

The medium-term economic prospects for Sri Lanka will

depend significantly on finding a lasting solution to the issue

of the North and the East, the intensity and speed of economicpolicy adjustments and structural reforms, consistency andpredictability of policy changes, the strength of national

consensus on major economic, political and social policy

issues and developments in the international environment. Theexpected medium-term global economic recovery andinternational trade expansion would create greateropportunities for more liberalised trade oriented economies

such as Sri Lanka. Increasing globalisation will not only off'ermore opportunities for developing countries but also createnew challenges demanding improvements in etficiency andproductivity. Meanwhile, the declining trend in officialdevelopment assistance (ODA) and increasing per capitaincome in Sri Lanka indicate that the country will have to

depend more on the international capital market for its externalresource requirements in the long term. In this context,obtaining a country rating from reputed international ratingagencies and maintaining it at or above the investment

category are useful in encouraging foreign capital inflows andfacilitating foreign market bonowings by the domestic private

sector, particularly for long-term investment, Sri Lanka couldmaximise the realisation of benefits from the emerginginternational trends if timely action is taken to make necessarypolicy adjustments and implement reforms not only to resolvethe existing inefficiencies and rigidities in the economy, butalso to face effectively emerging new challenges in anincreasingly uncertain external environment.As the medium-term outlook is highly sensitive to the

base assumptions on the above mentioned critical factors, four

alternative scenarios could be considered under differentassumptions as in the previous year's Report -viz., a baselinescenario, a high glowth scenario, a low growth scenario anda worst case scenario. Summary results of the baselinescenario are given in Table Ll0, while the results under allfour scenarios are described briefly below.Baseline Scenario: This is based on the assumptions ofa satisfactory progress in the peace process, effectiveimplementation of policy adjustments and structural reforms,safeguarding law and order, attainment of conducive politicaland social stability in the country and the completion of therequirements under donor supported programmes. Under. thisscenario, economic development is expected, broadlyconsisting of attaining an annual growth of about 7 per centover the medium-term, a decline in inflation to around 4 percent, a reduction of unemployment to about 5 per cent, animprovement in macroeconomic stability and a strengtheningof the resilience of the economy to successfuily face externalshocks. A steady decline in the fiscal deficit will enablemoving closer to the medium-term fiscal targets envisaged inthe FMRA, while releasing more domestic resources to theprivate sector, which is expected to drive economic growth,Increasing domestic and foreign investment will expand thecapacity in the economy and raise productivity. Increasingnational savings will finance a large part of rising investment,helping to contain dependence on foreign savings. Theexternal current account deficit would remain within amanageable level. The surplus rn the capttal and financialaccount, resulting from increasing utilisation of concessionalassistance and private investment inflows, would be sufticientto offset the cun'ent account deticit and record a surplus in theoverall BoP. Foreign reserves would rise to a comfortabrelevel, improving exchange rate stability and reducing externalsector vulnerabilities. The money supply would expand,supporting economic growth without building up inflationarypressures. Interest rates, as well as interest spreads, areexpected to decline with downward adjusting inflationaryexpectations, improving competition in the financial sector anddecreasing non-performing assets in the banking system.Lower population growth at around one per cent, with aneconomic growth of 5 - 7 per cent, will raise the average realper capita income by about 4 - 6 per cent annually. Rising percapita income, increasing job opportunities and expandingeconomic opportunities, particularly for the poor expectedunder the PRSP, will improve the general living standards ofthe people, reducing poverty on a more sustainable basis.High Growth Scenario: The high economicdevelopment scenario envisages an early achievement of aIasting peace and accelelated implementation of policyadjustments and structural reforms, supported by a strongnational consensus on major economic, political and socialissues of the country and strict adherence to law and order.These would enable the country to meet the requirementsunder the donor supported programmes in time, improving

donors' confidence and hence increasing opportunities for-additional concessional assistance for the country. Under-thisscenario, achieving a faster economic growth of over 7 percent with stability is possible, thus helping to raise the averageincome at a faster rate, reduce unemployment, and alleviatepoverty more swiftly than in the baseline scenario. Similarly,achievement of the medium-term fiscal targets envisaged inthe FMRA would be faster and the resilience of the economywould be stronger under this scenario, than in the baselinescenaflo.Low Growth Scenario: In this scenario it is assumedthat the ceasefire remains, but no further progress is achievedin the peace process, and only a f'ew policy adjustments andstructural reforms are implemented, with long delays. Thesewould lead to postponement or even cancellation of at leastsome of the concessionary programmes providing foreignassistance. Under this scenario, economic growth woulddecline to below 4 per cent, worsening the basic existingeconomic problems such as inflation, unemployment andpoverty, leading to economic, political and social instability rnthe country. The budget deficit and public debt would rise,increasing the risk of a debt crisis, The external sector woulddeteriorate, recording a deficit in the BOP and hence depletingexternal reserves and raising pressures on the exchange rate,leading to a vicious circle between inf'lation and exchange rate.Consequently, the market oriented economic policy regimewould be difficult to continue and policy makers may becompelled to resort to non-market instruments such as controlsand quotas, including foreign exchange controls, importcontrols and quota systems for distribution of importedessential goods,Worst Case Scenario: This scenario is based on theunfortunate possibility of a resumption of hostilities, andreversals in economic policy adjustments and structuralreforms. Under this scenario economic growth would declinebelow the population growth or even suff'er a contraction andconcessional fbleign assistance would be not available frommost donors. Inflation would accelerate, leading tohyperinflation or compelling the introduction of price controls,creating black markets, Rising unemployment and worseningpoverty would increase the risk of social unrest and politicalcrisis within a short period. A debt crisis would be almostinevitable, with a rising fiscal deficit and economic glowthdeclining below real interest ratesr . A widening currentaccount deficit and declining capital inflows would reduceextemal reserves to a dangerously low level and depreciate theexchange rate sharply. Finally, policy makers would becompelled to resort to a controlled regime, sttict controls onforeign exchange transactions and imports within a very shortperiod, and hence, introducing lationing for distribution ofgoods and services. The worsening economic, security and

social situation would Iead the country to a severe crisis,

destroying the hard-eamed developments achieved over a long

period,Although these simulations are highly sensitive to

changes in assumptions, they clearly reiterate the need forachieving a lasting peace early, implementing policy

adjustments effectively and deepening structural reforms in

time, while building up a strong national consensus on key

economic and political policy issues.

1.13 Economic Issues and Policies

The challenge for the country in 2004 is to lay the necessary

foundation, based on recent achievements, for a sustainable

and high long-term economic growth with greater equity'while moving towards peace, This has to be accomplished

while successfully achieving integration with globalisation andpaying due attention to protecting the environment. The

outward looking market oriented economic policy framework

introduced in 1977 has served the country relatively better than

the inward looking, public sector centred, economic policy

regime that had been adopted earlier. The new economic

framework increased economic growth, albeit less than

expected, expanded investment, diversified economic activity

and increased productive job opportunities, raised the living

standards of the people, reduced poverty to some extent, and

strengthened the resilience of the economy' The tiee-play of

the market released human efforts for production and gainful

employment. In the previous regime where goods weredistributed under rationing and economic activities were

regulated through bureaucratic controls, human efforts werewasted in acquiring goods or seeking applications for

approval, thereby creating enormous deadweight losses in the

economy. In the new regime, production and distribution

activities have been modernised, while choices have been

expanded for producers, as well as consumers'

Nevertheless, the achievements are far from the desired

and well below the potential levels that would do justice to the

country's human and natural resources, including its strategic

location close to one of the busiest sea routes in the world. The

basic economic problems such as poverty, unemployment andinflation continue to loom large. In fact, some economic

issues, particularly the macroeconomic imbalances, debt

burden and vulnerability to external shocks, have worsened

during this period. As discussed in detail in the Central Bank's

Annual Report 2002, three major factors were responsible for

limiting economic development: the continuation of costly anddestructive civil conflicts; the large macroeconomic

imbalances that primarily resulted from the continuing high

fiscal deficits; and the slow progress in economic liberalisation

and other structural reforms. These factors prevented the

country from realising the full benefits of the market oriented

economic policy regime, resulting in a moderate and volatile

annual economic growth with a weak trickle down effect, even

though the average growth achieved was relatively higher than

the growth during the previous regime. Therefore' it ts

essential to lay a strong foundation for a sustainable highquality (i.e., with greater equity and environment friendly)economic growth, based on experience, particularly by

learning from previous mistakes and failures'

A close analysis would reveal that high economic growth'

greater equity, environment protection and integration withglobalisation are not competing objectives' but are

complementary, reinforcing one another in the development

process. A sustainable annual economic growth rate at around

8 per cent will double the country's output within 9 years,

helping to reduce poverty, unemployment and inflation on a

more sustainable basis and to raise the living standards of the

people in the country. It is important to achieve such growth

with a greater equity through pro-poor growth oriented policy

measures enabling a large number of people, if not all, to

contribute to the growth as well as to enjoy its benefits. Such

a growth strategy would not only create a strong supportiveconstituency for difficult but growth oriented policy

adjustments and deep structural reforms, but will also help to

strengthen political and social stability. Similarly, sustainable

growth has to be environment friendly, while the environment

protection policies should not be obstacles to growth. Thus,

the protection of the environment and a sustainable economic

growth are closely interrelated, reinforcing each other under awell designed and coordinated policy framework. A

sustainable high economic growth would generate adequate

resources not only to protect the environment, but also to

improve it. Conversely, improving the environment, would, in

turn, make the high growth more sustainable in the long-term.Similarly, high sustainable growth and successful

integration with a globalised world are also two reinforcing

complementary objectives. As a small island economy, Sri

Lanka has to depend on export markets to enjoy the benefitsof economies of scale in production. Integration with world

markets is the only way to gain access to large and diversified

markets for the country's exports, obtain modern technology

and encourage capital inflows, which support investment

expansion. These factors would help the country to achieve a

high growth, strengthening its resilience to face effectively the

challenges emerging in the global market'With expanding and changing human demands, it is

costly if not impossible, for a country to become self sufficientin all its needs. Effective integration into the process of

globalisation would enable the country to concentrate on

producing goods and services in which it has a comparative

advantage, and maximise benefits by trading them with rest of

the world, thereby improving the welfare of the people. Thus,

a high economic growth has to be equitable, environment

friendly and integrated with globalisation to be sustainable in

the medium to long-term.Actions are needed on the economic front, as well as in

non-economic areas, to achieve a sustainable high quality

economic growth. Among them, the major ones are: peace,

50Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2003

Part IChapter 1 - ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, OUTLOOK, ISSUES AND POLICIES

political stability, and appropriate economic policy regime,prudent macroeconomic management, deep structural reforms,infrastructure development, human resource development,integration into globalisation, governance, and law and order.Peace: The first and the most important requirement isthe continuation of the ceasefire and moving towards asustainable political solution to the issue of the North and theEast. The benefits experienced during the last two years underthe ongoing ceasefire clearly demonstrated the potential peacedividend, in contrast to the human and economic cost of warexperienced during the previous period of about twenty years.

Peace will help to save human lives, reduce the suffering ofthe people, improve their safety and strengthen confidence. Itwill raise growth by expanding investment, improvingproductivity and opening new markets. Expanding investmentand increasing economic growth would create more productivejob opportunities in the country, shifting resources fromdestructive activities to productive activities. Higherproduction of domestic food crops would contain inflationarypressure. Meanwhile, increasing productivity and reducingcosts by removing transport barriers would help to contain costpush-inflation, fufther supporting price stability. Peace wouldalso facilitate fiscal consolidation, reducing defenceexpenditure requirements and encouraging more concessionalforeign assistance even to cover a large part of thereconstruction and rehabilitation expenditure. Falling def'enceimports, together with increasing exports, tourism, foreigninvestment and aid disbursement under a peacefulenvironment would enable the realisation of a surplus in theBOP and hence enhance external reserves, strengthenexchange rate stability and reduce external vulnerability.Rising production, decreasing transport costs, an improvingfiscal position and strengthening external assets wouldfacilitate monetary management, enabling interest rates to bereduced and low intlation to be achieved on a more sustainablebasis. The availability of these economic benefits to the public,in tum, would strengthen the peace process, political stabilityand social harmony, Thus, peace and sustainable high qualityeconomic growth are interrelated, reinforcing each other intheir implementation process.Political Stability: Political stability is essential forimproving investor confidence and effective implementationof policy adjustments and structural reforms. Investor surveysin many countries have indicated that both domestic andforeign investors give more weight to political stability thantax concessions in selecting their investment destinations. Inthe recent past, Sri Lanka has had at least one election (i,e.prestdential, parliamentary, provincial council or localgovernment) almost every two years. Elections are necessaryfor the activation of democratic political systems. However,elections every year or two not only increase fiscalexpenditure, but also create political uncertainty, discouraginginvestment, weakening macroeconomic management anddelaying the implementation of structural reforms. It is

necessary to build political consensus to find a solution to thisproblem, based on the experiences of other countries.Macroeconomic Policy Regime: Experiences in SriLanka, as well as in other parts of the world, indicate that theselection of an appropriate economic policy regime is the mostcritical economic decision in achieving sustainable high quality

economic development. In this context, it has become clear that

the market oriented policy framework is the only choice, as all

other alternatives have been unsuccessful, not only in Sri Lankabut also all over the world. It is also well accepted that inpreparing an economic policy framework, country specificconditions need due attention to ensure strong public support

and minimise potential conflict with non-economic objectives.However, such country specific features have to beincorporated within a market oriented economic policy regimewithout distorting its basic principles, i.e., allowing marketforces, primarily price signals, to decide the three basiceconomic decisions: what to produce, how to produce and forwhom to produce. Any government intervention has to bethrough a proper market incentive mechanism, rather thanthrough non-market instruments. The development of effective

and efficient regulatory systems simultaneously is essential to

prevent potential shortcomings in the markets, primarily causedby non-competitive market activity. Sri Lanka made a correctdecision by accepting the market oriented economic policy

framework in 1971 and was the first South Asian country to do

so. However, even twenty five years after its introduction, somemajor policies that were essential components of the systemhave not undergone adequate reform, as required, to becompatible with the basic principles of a market oriented policy

regime. This factor has constrained the realisation of maximum

benefits by the country. The inadequacy of progress in policy

adjustments and implementation of reforms is very clear in thefiscal sector, public enterprises, labour and land markets,

education, civil service, regulatory system, judicial process andintrastructure development. Meanwhile, some late comers in

the South Asian region are moving well ahead of Sri Lanka inadopting major components of the market oriented policyregime thereby, raising economic growth and improving theliving standards of the people.

In democratic societies, changes in policy regimes shouldhave wide and continuous consultations with the public.

Policies bring about changes and changes create uncertainty.In an uncertain world, through fear of loss or deprivation,sections of the public would naturally resist change, therebymaking their implementation rather difficult. Hence, a

continuous dialogue and awareness to remove the fear out ofthe minds of the public are necessary fbr building consensus

about policy changes, thereby ensuring the continuity and long-term sustainability of such changes. It also substantiallyreduces the risk of policy reversals under diff'erent political

regimes. Hence, effective marketing of policy changes is asequally important as the introduction of appropriate policy

changes.

Part IChapter 1- ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, OUTLOOK, ISSUESANO POLICIES

Macroeconomic Management: Improvement inmacroeconomic management, with prudent fiscal, monetaryand income policies, is essential to develop a conducive

macroeconomic environment for operating the market orientedpolicy regime effectively and successfully. The continuationof a large public sector deficit (the sum of the deficits in thegovemment and the public corporations) in Sri Lanka not only

increased the public debt burden to over 100 per cent of GDP,but also crowded out more productive private sector capitalexpenditure, constraining investment expansion andproductivity improvement, and hence lowering economicgrowth, Meanwhile, the existence of a high current accountdeficit in the budget (i.e., dissavings), prevented an

improvement in domestic savings, despite gradual relaxationof financial repression by the government. The high fiscaldeficit not only depressed economic growth, but also put

pressure on prices and exchange rates, resulting in relativelyhigh inflation and depreciation of the rupee. Thus, a strong and

sustainable fiscal adjustment strategy is essential to improvingmacroeconomic management. The approval of FMRA withspecific medium-term targets on the fiscal deficit and debt toGDP ratios is a majol step in the right direction. The fiscalimprovements achieved during the Iast two years areencouraging. Nevertheless, there is still a long way to go inorder to ensure the medium-term fiscal sustainability as

envisaged in FMRA as well as in PRSP. In this endeavourmore attention is required to improving revenue mobilisation,

as the declining trend in the revenue to GDP ratio has becomea serious structural issue. Improvements in tax policy,

expanding the tax base and strengthening tax administration byimproving management, efficiency and effectiveness, andintroducing effective incentive systems are the only ways toreverse this declining trend and ensure the mobilisation ofadequate resources. Further improvement in expenditurerationalisation by containing the wage bill, improving the

targetting of welfare schemes, reducing transfer requirementsto public enterprises, while introducing automatic costrecovery price adjustments and minimising interest coststhrough improvements in deficit financing and public debtmanagement are also necessary to support faster fiscalconsolidation. A comprehensive civil service reform would

raise the short-term fiscal cost even if concessional foreign

assistance helps to cover a large part of the restructuring cost.However, it is a price worth paying, as it would help to contain

the wage bill in the long-term and improve the efficiency inthe public service.A medium-term sustainable fiscal adjustment strategywould greatly facilitate monetary management aimed atsustainable low inflation and continuation of a successfulflexible exchange rate system. Meanwhile, the continuation offinancial sector reforms would improve the monetary policy

transmission mechanism and expand the domestic capital anddebt markets, u,hich are still at a rudimentary stage ofdevelopment compared with other countries. On the income

policy front, it is critical to introduce a national wage

adjustment policy based on productivity improvements. Such

a policy would help contain cost-push inflation pressures andsupport productivity improvement efforts. Thus, the abovementioned improvements in fiscal, monetary and incomepolicies would greatly help to develop a conducivemacroeconomic environment, enabling the country to realise

the maximum benefits through a private sector led sustainablehigh economic growth. It is also noteworthy thatimprovements in macroeconomic management and deepeningof structural reforms would reinfbrce each other. Increasing

economic growth, supported by appropriate macroeconomicpolicies, would create a conducive environment and provide

resources required for deepening structural reforms. Similarly,the implementation of structural reforms would facilitatemacroeconomic management directly, affecting economicpolicy adjustments such as fiscal consolidation, and indirectlythrough high economic growth.Deepening Structural Reforms: The necessity for

implementing structural reforms for a sustainable high qualitygrowth was discussed in the previous issues of the CentralBank Annual Report and government policy documents.including the PRSP. Similarly, the reforms required have beenclearly identifred and discussedextensively covering all major

areas such as public enterprises, labour and land markets,financial sector, civil service, education, health, judicial

processes and regulatory systems. In brief, structural reforms

are necessary to remove constraints on investment expansion

and productivity increases, and hence, to promote economicgrowth. Such reforms would reduce the cost of doing business

and improve investor confidence, leading to a faster expansionin investment. Similarly, they would improve efficiency in the

economy, reduce waste and encourage innovation, helping toraise the productivity in the economy, which is very low.Reforms have been in the process of implementation since

1977 but the progress is inadequate and significant delays inimplementation prevent fulI realisation of benefits. As the

required reforms have been identified, what is needed now isstrong commitment for their effective and timelyimplementation, and an effective public awareness programmeexplaining the beneflts of reforms, as well as the costs ofdelaying or not implementing them. Such a public awarenessprogramme is necessary to develop a strong pro-reformconstituency, enabling to face effectively, the potential

resistance against reforms from the beneficiaries of and rent

seekers from structural rigidities.Infrastructure Facilities: The availability of adequate,good quality physical and social infrastructure facilities at acompetitive price, with an efficient and eftective regulatorysystem, is a pre-requisite for a high sustainable economicgrowth. An efficient infrastructure network is a necessity forencouraging investment and improving factor productivity in

the economy. lnfrastructure facilities presently available in SriLanka are grossly inadequate. They are not adequate even to

52Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2003

Part Ichapter 1 - EcoNoMlc PERFORMANCE, ourlooK, lssuEs AND poLtctES

support a continuation of a moderate growth rate of around 5per cent, let alone moving the country to a high economicgrowth path. Therefore, substantial improvements ininfrastructure facilities, particularly in power, roads, publictransport and the water sector are necessary to support higheconomic growth.However, many enterprises supplying infrastructurefacilities in sri Lanka are still in the government sector and aremonopolies, often providing inadequate, low quality services.Many of them are also run inefficiently, and at a financial loss.They do not have resources to expand their capacityadequately to meet the increasing demand or to improve thequality of services. Therefore, bold reforms are necessary toaddress these issues effectively, enabling the development ofinfrastructure facilities. In this endeavour, the activeparticipation of the private sector in infrastructuredevelopment is critical as public sector investment isconstrained by severe fiscal limitations. such private sectorparticipation would also be helpful in improving efficiency inthe supply of infrastructure facilities. changing the role of thepublic sector from a 'player' to a ,referee' has to be a majorpillar in these reforms. The required reforms have beenextensively discussed and some initial steps have already beentaken in a number of sectors, but the progress has beenwoefully inadequate, and therefbre requires accereration inimplementation.

Experiences in sri Lanka as well as in other countriesshow that private sector led infrastructure developmentsrespond positively to liberalisation and deregulation. Thesuccessful experience in the telecommunications industry insri Lanka, which has been recording a double digit annualgrowth rate since 1992, provides a valuable experience fordeveloping infrastructure with private sector participation in aliberalised market environment. The regulatory systemnecessary for such private sector participation can bedeveloped under the Public Utilities Commission.Power: Sri Lanka's power sector has been experiencingchron r quality withlarge failures, highcostl, power cuts indrought years. The poor quality of power supply not onlyraises the cost of production, but also damages sensitivemodern electronic machinery, weakening the country'sexternal competitiveness. Furthermore, problems in the powersector have become a major constraint in expandinginvestment in the economy. This unfortunate situation hasbeen mainly a result of delays in power sector reforms and thepostponement of the construction of low-cost large scale non-hydro power plants. The situation has been further worsenedby the greater emphasis placed on expanding the consumer

base through special schemes such as rural electrification, thanon increasing the power generation capacity and reducingsystem losses.Meanwhile, low-cost, large scale power generation plantshave been in the project pipeline for a long period, withouteven their locations being finalised yet, even though thecountry has been experiencing severe power cuts regularly, Itis estimated that the ratio of output growth to power demandis, on average, about l: 1.5, i.e., for every I per cent growthin GDP, 1.5 per cent growth in power supply is required, dueto increasing power intensity in the economy. Thus, in orderto ensure 8 per cent annual GDP growth, power generation hasto be expanded annually at least by about 12 per cent. This isa difficult challenge compared with the average annual growthof electricity generation during the last twenty years, whichwas about 7.0 per cent, but is not impossible to achieve. As thesupply of adequate and uninterrupted power at competitivecosts is critical for long-term investment and growth, theunbundling of the cEB should be canied out without furtherdelay and locations for the proposed large generation plantsmust be identified to commence their construction early.Transport: Available transport facilities are notadequate to support a high economic growth, The roadnetwork has been not expanded adequately and even theexisting roads have not been properly maintained. Traffic hasbecome a serious problem in almost all major cittes.Similarly, the public passenger transport sector has beenexperiencing capacity limitations as well as low servicequality. These problems in the transport sector adverselyaffect the overall economic growth by discouraginginvestment and constraining productivity improvement. Theyalso have an adverse impact on poverty by restricting theaccess of the poor to markets and basic social services. Acomprehensive road development programme, consisting ofthe rehabilitation of existing roads and the construction ofexpressways to connect major cities and production areas, isnecessary in order to expand and integrate the domesticmarkets. The government has realised the necessity for roaddevelopment and has prepared a comprehensive programme.In this context, promoting private sector participation infinancing, building, operating and maintaining the roadnetwork is necessary to ensure efficiency and mobiliseadequate financial resources, as available governmentresources are very limited, Similarly, major reforms arenecessary in the public passenger transport system coveringboth bus transport and railway transport. Reforms in theRegional Transport Companies (RTCs) have to be plannedcarefully, as a number of reform initiatives implementedpreviously have not been successful. These companies havebeen depending heavily on budgetary resources to cover eventheir running expenses. Thus, they do not have resources toexpand their capacity or improve service quality. A wellplanned private-public-partnership (ppp) system could beconsidered as a first step, if the privatisation takes a long

time. Similarly, the quality of railway services is deteriorating

continuously, and the number of fatal accidents is increasing.

Meanwhile, it imposes a heavy fiscal burden, as the Railway

Department's inlticipation is necessary to make the railway

an efficient and viable transport service.Water: Sri Lanka is a water scarce country requlrlng

regular large investment in water storage, purification and

distribution. The availability of an adequate supply of water

for production activities and drinking purposes is becoming a

constraint to achieving high economic growth. This is largely

due to inadequate investment, as well as the lack of an

adequate incentive system for proper usage and conservation

of water. Water is distributed free under the irrigation facilities

without any incentive tor water conservation, resulting in

excessive usage and a high waste rate. The entire burden ofirrigation investment, both initial capital expenditure and

maintenance expenditure, is placed on the budget. As the

availability of government resources is becoming scarce, a

cost recovery mechanism has to be introduced at least to

ensure regular maintenance activities in the inigation sector'

Such a cost recovery system, if designed properly, will provide

net benefits to farmers as it can raise their income with

improvements in water availability more than the cost they

have to incur.The National Water Supply and Drainage Board(NWSDB) is the major supplier of pipeborne water in the

country. NWSDB has been expanding its capacity, but it has

not been able to meet the increasing demand for drinking

water. Meanwhile, poor quality water supply heightens the risk

of water borne diseases and other public health hazards. The

national water supply policy intends to address these issues

and to ensure that all residents will have access to safedrinking water by 2010. In order to meet this target, the

estimated annual investment requirement is about Rs.l0 - 12billion, compared with the planned annual average public

investment in the water sector of about Rs.5 billion. Thus,

there is a clear need for private sector participation in the

development of water supply. Meanwhile, the introduction of

an automatic price adjustment mechanism for water tariffs, at

least to cover the full operational cost and part of capital

expenditure, is necessary to ensure viability of the water

supply industry,Health and Education: In Sri Lanka, the government

has been investing continuously in health and educationfacilities, improving the human capital of the country.

However, with increasing demand and rising costs, public

investment has become inadequate to provide satisfactory

health and education services. Public health services have been

deteriorating quantitatively and qualitatively, due to resourcelimitations and weakening labour discipline. Meanwhile,

private sector curative health facilities have been expanding at

a faster rate in the recent past, even encouraging large foreign

investment in the sector. However, the private sector has not

shown much interest in expanding preventive health care

facilities, Therefore, it is necessary to develop a national health

sector development strategy, giving more emphasis to public

sector involvement in preventive health care activities, while

strengthening an eftective regulatory system to ensure the

quality of service, to support the private sector expansion in

health services and encourage expansion of health insurance

facilities.The public sector continued to be the major supplier of

education at all the three levels, i.e., primary, secondary and

tertiary, accounting for about 96 per cent of school students

and almost close to 100 per cent of university students' The

school density, at one school per 6 sq km, and a pupil/teacher

ratio at 21, indicate the availability of adequate primary and

secondary educational facilities and a wide dispersion over the

island. However, the deteriorating quality of public school

education has become a majol concern in the recent past.

Several education development projects with international

donor assistance have been initiated, but the progress has beenvery slow. Effective implementation of these projects,introduction and expansion of facilities for computer

education, and strengthening school management through the

recently established Schools Board and a School Based

Management System are critical in raising the quality of the

public school education sYstem.

The situation in tertiary education is more serious than in

primary and secondary education, as both capacity and qualityof services available in univelsities, and skills development

and training centres have become major economic, politicaland social issues. The continuing high structural

unemployment among the educated youth, deteriorating social

conditions and growing youth unrest clearly demonstrate the

need for deepening educational reforms without further delay.The government's policy document, i.e., PRSP, also

highlighted a number of constraints in the present educational

system and the necessity of strong reforms to address them'

The identified constraints are classified under four major

categories: quality constraints, institutional constraints,

language constraints and tertiary education constraints'Addressing these issues effectively requires adequate

resources, strong commitment and wide public support. Given

the tight fiscal situation, increasing demand for high quality

education and rapidly changing technological developments,

major components of the educational reforms would need to

include opening education, including tertiary education, to the

private sectot, while finding adequate resources for the publicsector to provide education in a competitive market

environment. It would also be important to change supply-

driven skills developments and vocational training facilities to

demand-dri ven f acilities.Integration with Globalisation: Globalisation will

continue, inespective of individual views thereon, expanding

opportunities as well as increasing challenges to countries.

The effectiveness of traditional measures of protection and

restriction are weakening rapidly, with improving technology,

54Central Bank of Sri Lanka Annual Report - 2003

Part IGhapter 1 - EcoNoMlc PERFORMANOE, ourlooK, tssuEs AND polrctES

expanding factor mobility and changing production systems.Therefore, the only available choice is to integrate withglobalisation, making every effort to maximise benefits fromavailable opportunities, while minimising potential risks. Asglobalisation will severely punish inefflcient and poor qualityproducers, improvement in efficiency, increase in dynamismand timely policy decisions are critical in realising themaximum benefits from integration with the world economy,As a small island economy, Sri Lanka has to depend heavilyon the export of goods and services to achieve a high,sustainable growth given the small size of the domesticmarket. In expanding export markets and encouraging foreigninvestment, the recently concluded Comprehensive EconomicPartnership Agreement (CEPA) with India and an earlyconclusion of a free trade agreement with USA wouldprovide an ideal opportunity to move the economy towards ahigh growth path.Governance and Law and Order: Impr-ovinggovernance and strengthening law and order have becomemajor necessities in achieving high growth. Improvement ingovernance is necessary to reduce the cost of doing business inSri Lanka, minimise delays in the approval and clearanceprocesses, lncrease transparency and accountability of thepublic service and improve the public policy making process.Reforms centred around improving the effectiveness andefficiency of the public service and public policy managementwould not only support achieving high growth, but would alsosupport poverty reduction through improvement in publicservice delivery systems, thereby ensuring equity, accessibilityand efficiency. Deteriorating conditions relating to law andorder not only discourage investment expansion, but alsothreaten the safety of private property rights, which are afundamental requirement for the effective functioning of amarket economy. Improvements in governance and law andorder need to be complemented with reforms in the judicialprocesses aimed at reducing long delays in the legal process,improving efficiency in decision making and upgradingservices, particularly by improving commercial aspects of thelegal system to be compatible with a modern market orientedeconomy.In summary, as the policy adjustments and reformsnecessary for sustainable high quality growth are difficult andpainful in the short run, a strong commitment and ownershipof these are critical for successful implementation. Similariy,appropriate sequencing is necessary to ensure consistency andcompatibility, in order to ensure maximum benefits. As theavailable domestic resources are limited, compared with therequirements for development, mobilisation of externalresources is unavoidable, In this endeavour, it is essential that

the government depend, as far as possible, on concessionalforeign assistance to minimise the debt burden of the country.Similarly, all available extemal assistance to the country hasto be allocated to the sectors generating an adequate rate ofreturn in order to ensure an improvement in the country'srepayment capaclty.Meanwhile, the large external financing requirements,and the continuing downward trend in official developmentassistance (ODA), consequent on the rising per capita incomein Sri Lanka, which reduces its eligibility foL concessionalfinancing facilities from international organisations, emphasisethe necessity fbr encouraging private capital inflows. In thiscontext, obtaining sovereign credit latings as soon as possiblefrom reputed international rating agencies will be a majorforward looking step, as it will encourage foreign privatecapital inflows and facilitate domestic private sector fbreignborrowing, at the best interest rates, Furthermore, it willsupport improvement in policy discipline and political andsocial stability in the country, as such ratings will be upgradedregularly taking into account developments on all three fronts,i.e,, economic, political and social.As the financial sector has to play a crucial role inmobilising the domestic resources, as well as foreignresources, required in raising economic growth, specialattention has to be given to financial sector stability andefficiency. Ongoing reforms and Iiberalisation have improvedfinancial system stability, efficiency and competitiveness.Nevertheless, intermediation costs and non-perfolming assetratios continue to remain relatively high, compared with othercountries, and have risen above the desirable levels. while thedomestic private debt market has not been developedadequately. The continuation of structural refbrms, particularlyin state sector financial institutions, improvement in riskmanagement in financial institutions and strengtheningcompetition through institutional consolidation are necessaryto reduce the high intermediation cost and implove theresilience of the financial system.All in all, Sri Lanka is at present at a crossroads, In thepast, the country has lost many opportunities due to negligenceor the pursuit of unsustainable ideologies. The cost of suchfailures is being borne by the people, especially the low-income people, of the country. When the rest of the worldmoved forward faster, Sri Lanka chose to be a laggard. Asimilar situation that has posed this hard choice to Sri Lankahas arisen today. If the country does not grab the opportunityand integrate itself successfully with the world economy, itwill be another sad story of 'missed opportunities', involvingheavy costs and still harder choices fbr Sri Lanka to regain thelost opportunities.
